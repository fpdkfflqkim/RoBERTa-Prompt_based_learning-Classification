"Bagels are average at best, very stingy here. No ketchup packets anywhere just one nasty bottle that everyone has to touch. The worst part about it is the people working here seem to have the biggest attitude, won't be going back here. Dude who runs the register needs to find a different job that doesn't involve ANY customer interaction.",1
The atmosphere is nice and intimate. Our server was very nice Claire and was quick to ask us if we needed anything. We ordered the tuna tartare for an appetizer and it was good for two and yummy! I ordered the Manhattan steak with twiced baked potato which was amazing! Loved the food and drinks try the Kentucky Buck and had a nice dinner! Can't wait to come back soon!,2
"Stayed 3 nights at the Grand and it was an absolutely terrible experience, found hair in my bed that obviously was not mine, even after I called and talked to the director of housekeeping the problem was not resolved! So gross! Never will I stay here again! The manager of the hotel didn't even take time to contact me and fix this issue terrible terrible costumer service.",1
"Looking at past reviews, it appears there has been a change for the better. We went for a Prix fixe menu and were delighted at the quality. Just like home cooking at my Nona. nService was very friendly but relaxed pace. That's ok, what's your rush? nThere was also entertainment with a lively guitar player. nGoing back for sure.",2
"Apparently there are 7 Beauty Bars? This is their Vegas bar, located just off the old strip. Just dark and sketchy enough to fit comfortably in this neighborhood. I thought my eyes were deceiving me upon walking up. Like a taste of home here in V town. It was Duran Duraight so we decided to stay for a bit. nDrinks ensued. NOTE They dont do nails at this bar. My wife would have been disappointed,",2
"I had a uninspiring, and overpriced BLT sandwich. The counter girl seemed annoyed that I had to ask her twice for water, honestly she made me feel unwelcome. At least she apologized for it taking 25 minutes to make the sammy. I would like to give them one star, but they are trying to do something positive downtown.",1
"This was my second time eating at this restaurant. It is a solid place for Korean BBQ. Nice decor, decent service, and good food. If you're looking for the best ""deal "" on Korean BBQ.I would say Tofu Hut. nIf your looking for the best meat selection.I would say Honey Pig! Their honeycomb pork belly is ridiculously good! But for a solid experience.Mothers is a nice spot to eat!",2
Bad pricey food. Had wings and fries and a tea. Ended up spending 25. The wings were gross and the fries were really below average. I would have given 2 stars if I had paid 15 but even then the food would just not be close to what I'd expect from a restaurant serving wings and fries. The service is good but that doesn't make up for the bad quality of the food.,1
"Had a good time here when I went in February. The dancers that do the acrobatic tricks are awesome. Like everything in Vegas, it's a bit pricey. The drinks were pretty watered down and insanely priced as well. However, if you want to experience LV, this is a place you want to go. Get there early though, because there will be a long line to get in.",2
"I was here on November 2011. This is a magnificent old train station converted into restaurant. A true historical jewel in Pittsburgh. I had a fillet Mignon that was really tender and juicy and very flavorful. I sat outside by the river bank and enjoyed a great of view downtown, the river and its many steel bridges. A very memorable experience.",2
"I made a special trip out there to get a Dole whip. Checked their website to make sure they were open.when we arrived 4.5 hours before stated closing time they were closed! There was a sign stating they decided to close a ""bit early "". Seems like really early to me! We were all really bummed. It will definitely make us consider other options next time!",1
"Food was ok. Their menu prices online are not their current prices. Also, watch out for delivery fee they charge without telling you, we paid 7 on top of our bill, thats more than what 1 entree cost! Hot and sour soup was watery and tasted like it came out of a can. The crab puffs were good, but didn't have any crab in them.",1
UGH.We were so disappointed when m y husband and I went to Burgr last weekend. This was our second time we went to Burgr. The first time about a year ago the food was amazing. This time it was horrible! Everything came out burnt. Service was rude and very short with us. It was not worth the wait or money. We will never go there again.,1
"Not the greatest Mexican food. Definitely overpriced for the quality of food served. I ordered the ""enchiladas "" and I didn't think they were very good. They seemed to be a bit tough when I tried to cut in half. I didn't really think you could screw up rice and beans.you can actually screw up rice and beans. I'm sure you can find cheaper and inexpensive Mexican food off of the strip.",1
"The service here was horrible! We waited in the bar for 5 min before even being acknowledged. Once the bartender saw we were standing there, she went to go check her cell phone before coming to say hello or take our order. Seriously? We were there at around 4 30pm on a Tuesday. They had no happy hour specials, we paid 4 bucks for about 25 French fries. It was pathetic. We will never go back.",1
"Stopped in for Saturday lunch with my son. The place was fairly crowded. Although I think that there were more employees then there were customers. That said, we share a couple of tacos, a burger, and some fries. All were good. The burger is very much in line with In Out, Five Guys, or The Habit. Not like what you get a Deluxe or The Grind. Nice decor, good service, and good food.",2
"Normally, I don't like to leave negative reviews. However, the lack of sanitary procedures here drives me to do so. First, she didn't wash her hands after her previous client. Second, she didn't change the sheet on the table. Third, she didn't even change the paper towel that went under my head. Triple ick. I left without getting the procedure done.",1
"Pretty low end for a purported high end hotel. Price is good 20 for lunch but it really seemed like a larger version of the Old Country Buffet. Nothing very surprising or interesting to choose from though the Indian station was a bit different. Crab legs were a bit suspect, too. I'd save my money and go to a better hotel buffet Wynn, Paris, Bellagio .",1
"My iPhone 5c's screen had popped out of the back color casing. I showed it to them, they took it into the back for a few minutes and then brought it back out to me, all fixed and good as new! They didn't even charge me! The staff was extremely friendly as well. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends, and come back if I ever have another problem with my phone!",2
"This is my first to write a review on yelp because I was pissed off when I walked out from this restaurant! Food was over priced, and the taste was so so. Beside the good, this restaurant has bad bad Servise, on top of that they add 15 on the bill automatically. If they want better tips only need to change their attitude instead charging tips that is business. Never go there again!",1
"Came here with a few college friends, so naturally we did the pint challenge. That is a solid deal if you put on your frat boy hat and man up. We ordered some bar food which was ok. The one waitress, who looked like Snooki, must hate her job. She was very unpleasant, which meant no tip for her. I'd suggest stroll in and pound a few free pints, then head elsewhere.",1
Someone told me this place had good Mexican food so I decided to stop by and order the torta first of all the service was terrible I never did get any napkins or silverware after about 20 minutes my food came out cold and it wasn't that good I love Mexican food and have been to many Mexican restaurants and this by far is the worst I have been to save your money and go to Taco Bell,1
"I went here for a happy hour with co workers after my 6 30 3 00 pm shift ended. I was really happy I got to experience my only happy hour with the co workers I went with here at the Hungry Monk. They have such a gigantic beer selection here and the appetizers are phenomenal. We were all able to get our food and alcohol at the same time fairly quickly. In addition, the server was very friendly.",2
"I can't understand why anyone would eat here. I've been there 3 times and simply put this place is awful. The potstickers are tasteless, but that is better than any of the noodle dishes. Those noddles taste as if they were made from wallpaper glue. nTotts Asian diner is right there and sooooo much better. Yuphia thai is down the street as well. Both are much better choices.",1
"Were my fried chicken sliders microwaved? I am suspicious. It was really wet I don't want to use the word juicy in the middle and insanely hot. The taste was just marginal. Nothing to write home about. One good thing though is the draft list. They have a large selection. We went for lunch, but thought of going the previous evening and it was just so loud that we turned right around.",1
"Obviously great selection of Rebel merchandise but outrageous prices. Seriously, the prices are almost twice what they should be. Why does the same hat cost 30 here, 20 at the ballgame, and 16 online from the manufacturer? But. If you want nice Rebelbilia, they've got stuff here that no one else carries. Bring a few quarters for parking.",1
This Buffalo Wild Wings was OK. There are better BWWs. When we walked in the hostest was preoccupied talking with other wait staff. She acted as if we were disturbing her. Our waitress was better. She was very nice. We were seated by the front. The hostest and other wait staff were very loud. All and all the wings were OK. I've had better. If it wasn't for our waitress I would have walked out.,1
"Played here for the first time ever this past trip to Vegas. I've always just walked right past this place, sandwiched between the Imperial Palace and Flamingo, it's a really small place. nI played roulette here for about 4 hours and came out about 200 bucks ahead, so I can't complain. Tossed another 60 into some slots on the way out and made out about 30 bucks over. nAlways more fun when you win!",2
"Worst buffet ever for anyone with any kind of allergies. I realize I am in the minority here, and my kids and husband did eat a good amount of food. But it wasn't great. They have NOTHING that is gluten free for dessert. Almost everything has dairy in it. Cute little pastries, cupcakes, pies, etc. I just couldn't eat any of them. I would not eat here again. It's robbery for the food you get.",1
Great breakfast. Both my wife and I shared a breakfast pizza and it was delicious. The 12 watermelon drink called Hat Bender was also good. My wife ordered that and I tried a little. Our server Dieago was a super nice and friendly guy. He's the one that recommend the pizza and drink. Nothing bad to say and I would return again.,2
I found a stellar jalapeno burger here! The burger was meaty and juicy. It comes with salsa but I chose to have that left off. My husband got the same burger with salsa and it was super messy! I can't stand messy burgers. You can always get the salsa on the side but I thought the burger was spicy enough without it.,2
"My first time eating their food and everything was great. Since it was my first time I was offered 20 off my order. I ordered their white pizza with sausage and pepperoni and their wings. Everything tasted very good. Only thing I have to complain about is that for 1 a wing, the wings were rather small in my opinion. That's definitely not a deal breaker. They've secured my business.",2
"Horrible. Some friends of mine and I were here one night before going to Marquee and hit this place up. The sushi place was too busy so this looked like the next best thing. We started with 3 appetizers the potato wrapped chorizo, white asparagus, patadas bravas. We were so turned off by the quality of the food we never ordered meals and left hungry. Enough said.",1
"okay, so here the thing! I went back to this restaurant and gotten my favorite item on the menu the ""orange duck "". but this time it was not very pleasant, it was tough and over cooked and definitely salty aot tasty at all. I am almost curtain they fried it in Clorox bleach EEK! X I'm never going back here ever again. disgusting!",1
"There is nothing like riding your cruiser to La Grande Orange on a Sat or Sun. This is a great place to listen to the music and people watch, while enjoying a nice breakfast, salad, sandwich, pizza, coffee or glass of sangria. It's usually busy, but fairly laid back. Grab today's paper, bring your laptop and enjoy the ambiance. The big draw back is the parking.",2
"It's Good, it's clean and the service just plain amazing for a fast food joint! My favorite item off the menu is the grilled chicken garden salad. Second fav is the spicy chicken sandwich. I'm addicted to the waffle fries. They actually taste like a potato! I know, crazy huh? n My kids love it, I like it so here we are.",2
"Excellent Italian, plus that bean salad is the best. It is quiet at lunch but a bit noisy at dinner. nUpdated 9 2012 Still serves excellent Italian food and prices at lunch seem very cheap for the quality they deliver. Give Fiamma a try also these two Italian restaurants are as good as you can get in Charlotte.",2
"There is no place else anywhere that I will go to get my hair cut. Randie is awesome. Every single time I go she is right on the money with the cut. The atmosphere is excellent and the owner is extremely friendly and welcoming. It is a nice, new upscale salon and has extremely reasonable prices on top of it. I can't say enough about my experiences here. Definitely top notch in all aspects.",2
"I frequent vegas 3 times a year on average and have never had a great beer until I came here. generally crap beer flows freely around vegas but this place steps up the game. unbelievable beer selection, by far the best I have seen in vegas. great taps and rare bottle selection. live music and pool too. what else is there? do yourself a favor and go",2
I live close to their restaurant and was very hungover on a Sunday morning and didn't want to leave my house so I decided to order for delivery. It only took an hour for delivery when I live just 2 miles away but I do understand the nature of the delivery business. I was just disappointed that it was luke warm and tasted like frozen pizza.,1
"The venue, LED wall, and sound system is top notch. There was actually quite a bit of space to move around in. There were fun acrobatics and Cirque performers at random moments. I recommend either getting a table or going with all females or arriving super early if you don't want a 1.5 hour wait. I will go again.",2
"Recently ate at Joe's for the second time and was disappointed. I love Liberty Market and Joe's Farm Grill, but Joe Real BBQ has a lot to learn from its sibling restaurants. The food we had was pulled pork, cheesy potatoes, corn. All 3 were in order were dry, dry and soupy flavorless. I love some good barbeque, I hope this was an off night for the real cooks that I had the first time.",1
"Steiner's let's have a talk, you serve food and allow people to smoke cigarettes, but cigars are over the line? To non smokers there isn't a difference, they both stink! Cigarettes cling to everything, your hair, clothes, hands and especially the room. I can smoke a cigar inside and a hour later you can't smell it. So please a reply would or a post on your Yelp would be appreciated.",1
"My regular groomer was booked full so I took my dog here. I was coded 45 and charged 50. The cut was rough that I had to trim off uneven part to make it look a little better. What bothered me the most is the attitute of the lady who checked in my dog. I saw her smilling at other people, but to me it was cold and unwelcome feeling. I will not go back for sure.",1
"One of my all time favorite places to eat dinner. Great food and great service for a reasonable price, considering you are on The Strip in big LV. I always have the Ribeye steak with papas and it has never disappointed. Outstanding Martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives. The wait can be a bit long, but considering all you get, including an exciting, up tempo atmosphere, it is worth it. I",2
"Excellent rice. Really tough tortillas, hard to chew. CC Sizzle too spicy, made my nose run! Ok beans. Ok bunuelos. Very filling. Disappointing after reading all the good reviews. Maybe I just caught them on an off day? I wanted to like it after reading their history and finding out about the homemade tortillas and chips.",1
"Location is awesome. Walking distance from downtown. Service was prompt and helpful. Food was amazing. tried the calamari and was very happy as I'm kind of a calamari snob. Then came the Lobster ravioli! Mind blowing. fresh, clean and flavorful. wished i lived in Madison just to eat here weekly. Thanks guys!",2
"Tues early morning, not crowded at all by dmv standards. Yet have waited over two hours since check in, with no hope of being seen soon. Only operating less than half the available windows. Can see fat supervisor stuffing her faces w McDonalds in her office, instead of getting off her big butt and getting this line moving. Obviously poor management. Gov Sandoval should be ashamed.",1
Wow! There was nooooo room to walk from one side to the other.each step was a battle! Beautiful place though! Music wasn't bad but there should be a limit to how many ppl are allowed in. Bought a drink and someone knocked it over on the bar right when the bar tender gave it and she refused to refill it! Not cool ,1
"Delicious! The ramen is really really good, drinks are amazing, and the dumplings are to die for! They're absolutely delicious, everything is freshly made, and the staff service is wonderful. First timers should feel comfortable going, they'll recommend options for you and help you pair courses. Highly recommend it!",2
The food is extremely awesome! It was my second time their but officially first to have a meal! I love their version of the loco moco! Servings are portioned very largely ! It's so amazing that it will give you a food coma! The house gravy is just simply delish!Oh I almost forgot their coffee bread Oh my gosh! Thats all i can say!,2
"Meh. You know it's nothing special wheo one working there is of the ethnicity the food is meant to be. It was a confusing experience. The food was nothing to write home about. Being from Reno, NV, I've experienced some awesome buffets in my time. This is not one of them. I'm sad that I wasn't impressed by this place, since it's within walking distance of my house.",1
"Wanted to try this buffet out after seeing all the positive reviews. If the price of admission was 20, buffet would have been fine. But at 41, not so fine. Prime rib was so so, and the other choices were somewhat slim and not that great. Too be fair, it was a Monday night, so perhaps they don't try as hard.",1
Picked up a Pizza tonight and it was terrible. They told me it would be ready in 20 minutes so I made sure to be there at that time. The box seemed warm but not hot. I didn't really think about it though until after I tasted it. For almost 18 this should of at least been hot. The crust was chewy not crisp at all. Not worth it.,1
If someone asked me where is the best place to get stabbed other than in prison. I wouldn't think twice. Fiesta Mall. This place is smelly and ghetto. I basically grew up in this mall and it has tanked within the past 5 years. Although I am glad they are trying to renovate and clean this place up with the new Best Buy and such but It still wont bring me back.,1
"I would give zero stars if possible. Four mix ups before we could even make it to the table. Staff was rude, unhelpful and uninformed. We flew in from Detroit and made reservations over a week in advance to ensure a memorable evening. It was memorable, but definitely not a positive one. We will not be back. I recommend going to Top of the Rock instead.",1
"Took my car in for a repair a few years ago. This time I needed some major work done and seemed to remember a great, honest experience from years ago, so I figured I would try them again. I was not disappointed. Great customer service, very fair pricing, professional, courteous.I will only consider them for all repair needs in the future. Highly recommended!",2
"It's a family tradition to come here during or around Christmas. The xmas lights decorations and cacti never fail to impress. The sad part about coming during xmas though is that the chocolate factory itself is closed and so you can't expect free chocolate samples! Thus, come prepared with your own hot chocolate to sip during the self guided awesome lighted cacti tour. ",2
"Absolutely terrible food. Came here for brunch. And what I ordered was totally different than described in menu. I was taken aback when it arrived, the server asked are you allergic. Well no, I'm not allergic, but that shouldn't be the only question you ask. Then when your patron does not touch her food, you would think as a server you would inquire. Nope. Won't eat here again. ",1
Nice decor inside and out for world wide chain. Food good not great and higher priced. Hiromaru better tasting for similar price. Monta much better bargain. Music here was so loud could not have conversation. Who comes to these places to listen to loud 'club' music? Hard seats need cushions. Too many better places so would not return.,1
"Today, the hub and I met with Chrysty to take our first family picture with dogs in tow at Tempe Beach Park. Even though the forecast has been dreary, she made the day all cheery. We forgot that it was drizzling and cloudy. We loved her ideas for pictures. And she worked very well with the dogs. We had a lot of fun and can't wait to see our results.",2
"Somehow my previous 1 star review was removed, so here we go again. Called a couple hours ahead to schedule a pick up and dispatch said I was all set. Then I get a call 1 minute before my pick up time saying that they won't make it in time and they don't know how long it would be. Missed my appointment and will NEVER call them again.",1
"Had lunch with a coupla friends on Tue 3 Jun just as it opened about 11 am n Hostess sat us by the pool, which was nice. n We shared the 12 pretzel cheese fondue app, pretty good and just the right amount for 3 people. n For 27 I had the 36 hour pork ribs, also pretty good. n The waiter Asian dude, wish I remembered his name was great and attentive.",2
"Simply as good as it gets. Wonderful tacos Hawaii style! Fish is fresh and tasty. When I went in for the first time, I was back two additional times within a week. So good! Friendly, hard working staff, place is clean and packed to the gills pun intended every time I have been. Hands down, a 5 star rating in my book. So happy this place is close to where I live. Highly recommended!",2
"Really good New Orleans cuisine at very reasonable prices for a fine dining establishment. Our server, Lana, was attentive and very friendly. And 1 2 price wine in the bar on Mondays! I was just surprised that there was no ""barbeque shrimp "" on the menu a staple of New Orleans. If I find it there the next time we go, I'll add a star to my review provided it's prepared well !",2
"I visited here twice and was impressed with how beautifully plated and appetizing the food looked. I tried what I believe was the sage fried chicken. The taste didn't quite measure up to the looks though. It was kind of bland for my taste, but if you don't mind bland and overpriced, you may very well enjoy HHAGG. or make that HHANG for Hash House A No Go",1
This review is for Blueberry Cheesecake. No. Just say no. The blueberries are REALLY hard and frozen. They are like little flavored icicles.The ice cream part was delicious. It really had a rich cheesecake flavor. I would love to have regular cheesecake custard. It was hard to enjoy because the blueberries were SO hard.,1
umm I will never go here again and never recommend this place. nIn fact 2 of my other friends that went on different days than i did agree with me on this one. nI had the special combo sushi roll meal thing they had and it was really bad. I felt soo hungry after eating lunch here that I ended up having an early dinner.,1
"Love Love Love this place! nI had a 2 week trial membership and so wish I could go full time! The people here are wonderful! The cleanliness, in one word, OUTSTANDING! If you want an amazing hot yoga experience and let the yoga bug bite you, you won't regret it. Try it! I miss this place and will definitely take advantage of future specials!",2
Amazing place! Fried p b is my favorite! I also really loved the Blt! You can tell the food is made with top quality products! Service was great! They had REAL sweet tea ! To die for! Honestly I I have tried more then one thing and have not been disappointed at all! I will be a retuning customer! Tell your friends! Also there prices are just so good! You can actually great food for under 10.00!,2
"Was looking for a place to eat lunch, didnt want fast food.but. yeah McDonald's would have probably tasted better. Walked in and noticed the outdated decor.and the smell. Decided to give it a try anyways. Ordered the chili burger. As soon as they delivered I was like ugh. I took one bite and it was the worst chili i had ever had! Never going back.",1
"First, let me say that On The Border is my favorite Mexican restaurant! My experience with the Mesa OTB was very so, so. Service was slow. Food was OK, but not nearly as good as what I'm used to. I believe I am spoiled as I live very close to the OTB on Bell across from Arrowhead Mall where I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal!",1
"Hello food network, we need intervention please run an episode of restaurant impossible. Their 16 dollar bowl of pho is awfully bland, you are certainly better off driving 2 miles off the strip to eat a more graceful bowl of pho. I also had their fried rice and it was awful as well. For a restaurant inside a major hotel, I expected plenty more.",1
"This is a solid economical choice for lunch and a great Italian Beef sandwich. Get yours ""dipped "" if you don't mind a little mess and want more flavor. The interior is also much nicer than you would ever expect from the facade. I will be back again soon. UPDATE I went back again this weekend the Chicago Dog is wonderful.",2
"They did a repair on my sofa in January that lasted all of 6 months before the same fault recurred. After 2 phone calls and an email that went unanswered, I threw in the towel and bought a new sofa from The Dump. Old sofa went out with the bulk pickup this morning. That was 400 I'll never see again!",1
"After reading excellent reviews of this place, we decided to give it a try. The food was excellent and the drinks were delicious. Unfortunately we had really horrible service. Our waiter routinely ignored us and went to other tables multiple times. We waited about 35 minutes for one of our courses. We wanted to like this place, but after the poor service, we will not return.",1
Yes this deserves a five star review. Everytime we have gone we have been pleased. They have get this HOT FOOD I am sick of getting luke warm food at restaurants. We had the tenderloin medallions and even though I like it well done they were still moist and not dried out. Give them a try. You won't be disappointed.,2
"Do not and Do not rent car from here. nI love Fast break and I rented car from here. what a mistake. They did not honor upgrade because ""privately owned "". Car was dirty all the way. fast renting and fast return but not worse paying extra. get fox rental car or cheap rental car company,if you need cheap rental car. Budget is not like avis or national rental car level.",1
"Satay Asian Bistro Bar was excellent we had several great appetizers and my husband had a delicious curry. They did have one issue when my husband asked for a glass of Zinfandel they brought White Zin Well, we live in wine country in Sonoma County, so I guess we should cut them some slack for not knowing the difference!",2
"The pizza is pretty good and unique, and if you like doughy crust you'll be happy. Plenty of options for veggie heads and meat eaters alike. Great tap list, I just wish someone would come over and offer to get me another beer. Really poor service up to this point, probably won't be back. There is another one at Norterra, if you really care that much.",1
The food was very tasty cooked to perfection on a very busy night . Service was a bit slow but the place was jam packed and it felt like everybody was seared at the same time. I like that they split the plates as me and my wife ordered the lamb and stripsteak and shared both plates.I have eaten here a few times in the past and the quality was excellent will return again,2
"Chicken basil was very greasy and had almost no basil in it. I ordered spice level 7 and found it just spicy enough for my taste. I walked in and placed my order to go around 8 30 pm. They were very prompt in making my order. It's just too bad it was so greasy. It gave me a tummy ache later in the evening. This was my first time at an Archi's, and I probably won't venture to try it again.",1
Nordstrom rack is a good place to get quality goods for less. IF you go when they are having a clearance even better. I got NYMJ for 39 from 114 a pocketbook from 44 to 24 a cute Paris top for 19.95. nyes you have to take the time to go through things but if you are a serious shopper then you don't mind. nIt's clean and well laid out too.,2
"C'est de loin mon caf u00e9 pr u00e9f u00e9r u00e9 pour travailler! On peut s'installer sur la terrasse entour u00e9e d'arbres ou u00e0 l'ombre sous le gazebo. L'endroit est paisible, chaleureux, on s'y sent chez soi. C'est un petit tr u00e9sor cach u00e9 du Plateau. Bref, un incontournable selon moi!",2
"Up there or down there with Circus Circus in terms of just bad. I could come up with more adjectives,but bad just the right description. I went to pay with a roll of quarters from the Palace Station and the cashier actually counted them one by one. Bad service,bad food ,bad atmosphere. Get it ?Just bad. Strange though,the Sunset Station Palace Feast buffet is actually decent and edible.",1
"My boyfriend literally wanted us to come every morning of our Vegas trip! lol, thats how great the food is! Im happy they have built more since my first time. I would try to the one off of the strip for a shorter wait still 30 minutes minimum . nFood was fast and super yummy albeit quasi cold.that still did not affect my feelings for this place",2
"It's airport food, but i was hoping Baja Fresh would taste like it did outside of the airport. I got the chicken burrito special and it tasted fresh, but was pretty bland. I probably should've gotten some hot sauce or something to give it some flavor. Now that I think of it.they didn't even offer me any salsa or anything! Boo.",1
"Owned and operated by Koreans. nRotating sushi bar. nNot very authentic. Takes forever to seat groups. Takes about 20 minutes to seat ppl even if there is nobody in the restaurant. The cheesecake was still frozen when I grabbed it. nIf I wanted a frozen cake, I would have ordered an ice cream cake from Coldstone",1
"How can you go wrong with anything at Pei Wei. I stop in here at least once a week to grab lunch and it's always been fresh, hot and quick. I love that they now have a smaller size portion of your favorite dish or the regular size. Even the small portion is a good size and I still usually have leftovers. Definitely one of my favorites to head to for a good lunchtime meal.",2
"Really great Mexican food local hole in the wall. The beans and rice are fantastic, and the tortillas are homemade and amazing. I have had the chicken tacos and found the meat a little bland, but had the Carne Asada the next time and it was very good. Can get crowded at lunch! I always call ahead and go pick it up so I can get back to work.",2
great spot.we live up the road and is our go to restaurant. i've had about everything on the menu and its all awesome.my fave is the citrus soy salmon and the cucumbers they put on the on side are heavenly! During the fall they have the pumpkin cheesecake that will make your tummy very happy. Do yourself a favor and go to WCG!,2
"We like to support locally owned small businesses, and this place is great! They have the BEST coffee, roasted here in Tempe. The most delicious French toast we've ever had! Fresh squeezed o.j. with lots of pulp , organic milk and produce plus cage free eggs are all part of what sets this place apart from other breakfast places. nI'm sure we'll be back often!",2
"First time visit.usually I order from Yummy Grill Sushi off Eastern. I ordered the mongolian beef and got about 6 fatty pieces of meat, a pretty big portion of rice and tons of white and green onions. I called to complain and advised the cashier to call the dish onions, onions and more onions.he hung up on me.",1
"Looked up Leonidas on their website and was excited to see a menu for their cafe. It listed how in addition to all of their chocolates, it also listed ""pastries "" and specifically multiple cheesecake choices. We go down.no cheesecakes or pastries of any kind! Young girl working says the owner only has those out on the weekend! Wasted trip.",1
My experience here sets the standard for Breakfast Lunch diners. A warm and down to earth staff with great food selection at affordable prices with quality ingredients. Impeccably clean with fast and efficient service. Food is delivered to your table fast and delicious. There is plenty of parking as well. Will definitely be coming back to this restaurant!,2
I have been going to Salon Lulu since it opened. I absolutely love how clean it is and all the independent employees are super sweet and professional. I would recommend this salon to everyone. Jasmine has been doing my hair for years and she does a great job. I would recommend Erin also who is super sweet and does a great job doing hair.,2
"Karen Wong's is one of my favourite chinese restaurants . probably because Karen is such a big character, she makes you feel like you're a long lost relative every time you visit. The food is really good too, whether you're eating in or having a takeaway. I look forward to every visit and have had lots of great times here with friends.",2
"Worst company I have ever had the misfortune of having to deal with. A salesman told me internet would cost 30 month. They called back 2 days later to offer me internet for 45 month plus the cost of a router. Finally, a few hours later I was told it would be 50 month. I will never deal with century link for anything due to the incompetence of their employees.",1
"I just don't get it , I really don't ! All the hub bub that Dunkin' has finally made it to the Vegas Valley my opinion, leave, leave now ! I've tried Dunkin' 4 times at two different locations including the one on Rainbow simply put, the DONUTS SUCK ! People, if you need a donut, show a little love to Ronald's they deserve it.",1
"I have been to this chain, different stores, several times. Never with my kids. Food and service were good. I wish that they had a menu that included kids items. Disappointing that I had to by a 20oz cup for my 4yr old. The burger was too big and neither of my kids finished it. I won't be returning with my kids. New style coke machine is a major plus. Otherwise, 3 stars.",2
"Really unhappy with the service and bedside manner of this office. The only hope is for nurse ""g "". The doctor didn't even know if I had been given a medication when she had my notes from urgent care, the receptionist is incredibly rude every single time. I would not recommend this place they are even rude to medical device vendors they referred me to.",1
"They take 14 days to brine their corned beef. Enuff said. n. n. n. nOh, okay, here's some more 1. Friend had the fish and chips but said they weren't memorable enough to rave about them. 2. Though friend did have the Snake Bite and said it was 'awesome!' 3. But we both agree that the corned beef alone warrants a return visit. 4. And the waitresses are Irish! Love their accents!",2
"Have been living here for over a year and love it. Very friendly maintenance people. Very modern interiors, including one of the nicest kitchens I have seen in a Vegas apartment. I live in one of the stand alone lofts and all of my friends are always impressed by the unique layout of the loft and by the fact that I have an entire building to myself. I would strongly recommend living here!",2
It's 11 30 at night went to check into the hotel after a long 6 hour drive an was denied a hotel room because I dot have a credit card. I explained to to him I had more than enough cash an he questioned me as to why I had so much an told me he couldn't do anything WILL NEVER be staying at a comfort inn ever again,1
"Got a gel coated French manicure which should typically last at least two weeks. Try not even 4 days. On multiple nails, it's lifting and peeling off. Not in to spending 60 for a gel manicure and regular pedi every few days.ridiculous. Not sure how they usually do as it was my first time here but I'm not happy with my results, or lack there of rather.",1
"We went here to pick out fabrics for a quilt. We used a few tables to pick out color schemes and see what we were working with. The worker walking by actually said to us, ""You ARE going to put that away, right? "" I was so apauled. Then when we went to get all the fabric cut the lady was also very unfriendly and just had poor customer service in general.",1
"Great ma and pa shop. I have taken a lot of my high end items here and am always happy, if it's not exactly what I want they always re do it for free. Just remember to take cash as they do not accept debit or credit cards and does take about a week to get your clothes back so don't wait till the last minute",2
Horrible service for a very expensive steak. If your looking for a fine dining steak house this is not the place the place to go. Nobody wants there 70 steak to be butterflied our waiter was very hard to find when we needed him and never checked on us. Next time I will stick to Mastros At Donovan's you do not get what you pay for!,1
"I love breakfast and was really anticipating vovomeena. But was quite disappointed. Service was rude. For example I asked if there was an alternative to the meat sides. The gals answers was. ""You caot have it. "". Wow. Thanks. Food was nothing to brag about. Can't say that I feel the need to return or recommend this spot.",1
"Had my wedding reception here. On the menu we had prawn as appetizer, main entrees chicken, steak, or salmon and dessert was cheesecake. The food was excellent. I had the salmon and I still think about it to this day. I don't know how regular dining was, but for my reception it was all worth it. Everyone was more than satisfied with their choices.",2
I should have read the reviews before going here. They don't put prices on the menu for the drinks because a draft beer is almost 10. Service was terrible. Took forever to be acknowledged. Waitress saw my empty glass and empty plate. Why did it take ten more minutes to flag her down to get bill? Gave it two stars only because the food carnitas tacos were actually really good.,1
"I LOVE this place. Only been there twice, but everything I've had has been exceptional. Crispy spring rolls, fresh pork shrimp spring rolls, pho, grilled squid with vermicelli noodles all absolutely delicious. Cute little place, nice but simply decorated. The staff is courteous and attentive. Currently one of my fave restaurants in Charlotte!",2
"Saltiest clam chowder ever! Pair that w Caesar salad with salty croutons and you got yourself kidney failure! Waitress was clueless and kept asking us if everything was ""still wonderful "" ? We had to change the soup cause we couldn't swallow that much salt. Next soup was just as bad! We won't come back!",1
"We drive out of the way about 45 minutes, once a week for this gem of a restaurant. Great food, and I can't believe how fast it comes out. My favorite is 35 They're always busy, and really friendly. It's comfy, and we always end up ordering stuff to take back with us for later in the week. This place is amazing!",2
Tha atomosphere at the Rainforest is delightful especially for a 7 year old's birthday. But it is pricey. 2.99 for ice tea or soda. Sandwhiches average 15.but what I thought was really cheesey was the .99 charge for a birthday cupcake Really? nCome on. Definite rip off! nBut for a special occasion it was worth it ,1
"Super hip vibe, clean and cozy interior, and a menu focused on shellfish. hint ask for the menu in English . This place is not cheap average 4 per oyster , but worth the splurge. We did two of each on their chalk board, plus a terrific bowl of mussels. The waitress was helpful and super cool, and the wine list above average. Stop here for a ""meal "" like we did, and you'll leave with a smile.",2
"Pretty meh. We got a selection of burgers, wagyu burgers and sliders and none of them were anything to write home about. All of them were overcooked and just plain ok. I would only return if I needed to get something quick and it was in front of me and one of the only options. Was not impressed. We also got wings and no one touched them they looked gross and tasted even grosser.",1
My sister in law found this salon through her nail lady . I needed a fill for my lashes and made an appointment . She was easy to get into and her prices where very reasonable . I paid 65 for a lash fill and I will be back! She was sweet and very quick. Her work is beautiful and she has made a new client out of me. I would recommend her to all.,2
Just great! I have boarded my 3 dogs and cat here and they come home so happy and healthy it's like home away from home for them. I am able to relax when my husband and I travel for work and can't take our fur babies. The staff is helpful and friendly and always ready to give me an update while we are away.,2
"I went here about six weeks ago and ordered Kiki's burger. It was prepared well and tasted great. The house made pickles were also good. The service was OK. They definitely keep the servers busy and you pretty much never see them unless you're ordering or paying. I like this location better than the Windmill one. If I had gone to that one first, I would not have tried this one.",2
"Why all of the negative reviews? I had a great experience with good service and tasty food. Cobb salad was good. Clam chowder was good. I know, I need to eat healthier.but it's Vegas I enjoyed eating in the courtyard.right in the mix of the casino, but partitioned by fake shrubs. For Vegas, prices were reasonable.",2
"Go to spot for sports watching, lots of TVs everywhere. I came here to watch all the USA world cup games and the NCAA basketball tournament. This bar has a typical bar food menu but I really enjoy everything I have had on it. The service is average and gets slower during big games and when the place is crowded. They have a nice patio with outdoor seating as well and TVs outside!",2
"Friendly service, had high expectations from the review on here. I ordered the carne asada nachos. The chips themselves were extremely greasy, which ruined my appetite. I was so looking forward to reading the pile high presentation of the nachos, what a let down.one star because they have Cherry Pepsi.",1
"With out a doubt the worst Waffle House. Customer service is absolutly worthless. Our server Vanessa was such a bitch to us, other customers and even to her coworkers. The manager Vernon was just about as useless. Will never go back to this location. If you like getting talked down to, by all means eat here.",1
"Classic italian food with a modern touch, nEat there several times on different occasio nThe food is good and service excellent, they are really proffessionnal I recommand the chicken calzone, the shrimp pasta, and the great cannelloni Give a try in their home made desserts The only cons i have is the price nToo much expensive for a pasta and pizza food",2
"Great name but the experience is all downhill from there. Food's ok, but the portions are small. There's a bad mildew y smell that knocks you in the face when you walk in and the service is horrible. It's like they're mad at you for giving them your business. And don't dare ask for a refill on water.",1
"Union Grill serves one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh. I ALWAYS get the ""Chophouse. "" You get to choose from a large selection of topping. for example I got swiss cheese and avocado guacamole yesterday. It comes with your choice of sides. I got waffle fries. SO delicious and I think very reasonably priced for the quality.",2
Awlful service. If you are planning on coming here better give yourself at least 2 hours of waiting time. Unbelievable. Even just to drop off equipment. There's about 2 to 3 people working at a time and about 15 people in line waiting usually. Other cox stores are not like this. Save your time and go to another store.,1
I love chipotle. I think it has fresh and delicious options. I was turned off for a while because my usual chipotle on Thunderbird gave me a salad with a giant green bug crawling in it. I finally wanted it again and went to this one. They were nice and the food was great. My usual chipotle experience.,2
"Horrible service! As soon as we were seated our Male server said, ""Let me guess, you have a groupon. All my tables have groupons tonight it's annoying. "" Hmmm there goes your tip! We Called the manager the next day she didn't seem to care. We Won't be returning! And if you don't want the groupons, DONT OFFER THEM!",1
Grrr no green tea yogurt. The girl at the counter was so sweet and nice and she told me that they would not bring the macha green tea to the Vegas location. nSo I guess the only place I can get it is when I go back to LA since they have it there. Sad Face But I still have Jamba Juice so I can suffer for just a little bit. lol,2
"This place closed totally abruptly.and I was SO SAD! I was there a couple days prior.and we made plans to meet there again. My friend beat us there and called us a bit confused. ""Why is it closed, i thought it was 24 hrs? Why are there no tables or chairs inside? "" WTFFFF? thats right, its so dramatic it needs 4 Fs , it had closed. Without even letting anyone know. Boo!",1
"Worst service ever! I pulled up to where there's usually someone waiting to sell you the fancy upgrades. Not a person in sight, there's was another customer just sitting there as well. I decided to check inside and only 1 person and he looked like was on break having drink. He decided to help me but I saw the red flags and ran! Place looked like it was going out if business!",1
"Ate at the bar and Rick the bartender was the most miserable guy ever. Food was ok just but lacks imagination. Fish platter has the same coating on the scallops, fish and prawns . Zzzzz,! Not worth the money even with the 2 for 1 entree voucher. Mai Tai cocktail using Cabo Tequila was good . That was 5 but Rick and the food 4 Not coming back",1
The only reason for 2 stars is because I like their food. Service was slow and the employees would step away from the register for several minutes at a time before taking orders. When their was a problem with a customer there was a scramble to try to fix it and a lot of confusion. Would recommend different Wendy's locations over this one.,1
"This store is great. The bakery is one of the best in town. The donuts here are the closest thing to a Dunkin' Donuts, since we don't have one in the area. The place is an old VONS and it still looks like it too, lol. The place is very clean and there is a lot of parking. Don't expect many long lines, but do expect LOW prices!",2
"Pretty disappointed and I really wanted to like this place. I had the carnitas tacos and the meat had almost no flavor, same for the tortillas which completely fall apart as soon as I picked up the taco. The beans and rice were just OK. The service and atmosphere were decent, but so what if the food is bland.",1
I had the catfish sandwich. It was so good that taking that last bite made me sad. The Mac and Cheese was delish and the watermelon cucumber salad was good unusual. My husband had the smoked turkey sandwich Alabama style and collard greens. He said that everything was very good. I'm excited to go back!,2
"I love Fresh Wasabi! If u love to eat rolls, they have SO many to choose from. They have the largest variety by far, and they are really tasty too. They get creative and just don't offer the ""usuals "". They are fair with their pricing. The only negative I have is that they don't sell liquor, however, they do have beer, saki and Japanese wine.",2
"Our trips to south point are always highlighted by a trip to S S. We love the shakes and enjoy the cheap burger and fingers specials. Service here is never quick. There is always a wait. The restaurant is never overly clean. The service is friendly and the food is fresh. Personally, that works for me!",2
"We came back last Friday night, on a very busy night to see if there is any improvement. WOW! We were blown away. Our waitress was amazing, very attentive and sweet, the food was amazing, we felt totally taken care of and there was nothing, I mean NOTHING to complain about! Thank you Delux for proving that your reputation has a basis. We will be back and we will recommend you to others.",2
"Food nAll three of us ordered different dishes, but all three tasted like they were cooking on an old greasy grill. Nothing to write home about. Decor nFriendly, neighborhood restaurant with comfy seating, comfortable lighting, and reasonable noise level. Service nWait staff is attentive and informative, but not skilled at arithmetic. Recommend that you add up your own bill.",1
"Love this place for it's homey feel. Best weekday specials, best karaoke on Thursdays, best bartender on MTuFrSa. Mark is beyond amazing. He talks to you like a friend and treats you like a normal person, no corporate smiles bullshit. Mark is amazing. Trent is grumpy but we don't hold that against the place.",2
I had a great time browsing this store. They had so many books to go through. This store is really big and around every corner seemed to be another room filled with books. The store is laid out in an easy to explore manner with all the books clearly organized by subject and author. If you like browsing through bookstores like I do I would tell you this is a must visit store.,2
"Negative stars again I say! I've been contacted by what I'm sure is one of their employees trying to bully and harass me into changing my review. I stand by it, it goes unchanged Cox! Which I'm more then positive the corporation would appreciate their employees reading through reviews to harass customers. Keep a leash on your people.",1
I love the grounds that surround the Franciscan Renewal Center. I've attended Mass here a few times and believe the services are a bit too Liberal for my taste. I prefer more traditional Masses. I do love the St Francis Festival Adoptathon Blessing of the Animals annual tradition. It's an event I attend each year. Differ tastes for differ Catholics.,1
"Have eaten here two times. Once we ate in and the other time carry out. Both times the food was fantastic. Perfectly spicy and saucy. Only minor complaint is I wish there was more chicken in the main dishes. The chicken biryani was delicious. Naan was toasty, crisp and perfect. Can't wait to go back!",2
"Don't waste your time or money here. Mediocre food. Just hit one of the better fast food spots in the airport. My ""beach salad "" was majorly disappointing. My friends got the nachos which were decent but not worth 15. I ended up buying a pizza 2 hours elsewhere I was so hungry. One thing positive tt looks cool inside.",1
"There were three in our party and each of us had a very bad experience. Sushi was not very fresh and had a very fishy smell. There are numerous sushi restaurants in Charlotte that are far better than this one. When we very politely commented to the owner that the meals were all disappointing, he was extremely rude to us.",1
"I wasn't that impressed this visit. I didn't get the same person from last time though. Today the guy that did my nails seemed to be in a hurry. I was done in 40 minutes for a new full set, although they were white tips. Now as I'm looking at my nails, there are lots of small bubbles from the clear topcoat. I wish he wouldn't have rushed.",1
"This place is fantastic. The rooms are very well appointed, very neat, and feel very new. The bed was very comfortable. The bathrooms are clean, spacious, and well appointed. The Jacuzzi tub is a fantastic touch. For travelers staying for a while, the washer dryer in each room is also fantastic. Kitchen a very big plus.",2
A pleasure from start to finish. We were warmly greeted and promptly seated. The server noticed that we were glancing around the restaurant and immediately asked if we wanted to be moved. We didn't but how nice. The anniversary menu was a real blast from the past. Retro menu and prices to match. All was excellent.,2
"We loved it. We used a Groupon. But the food was worth full price in my opinion. I would pay full price for the food. Fast service, friendly service. The portabella burger is amazing and the fries were hot. It's not 5 star but if you're at circus circus you're not looking for 5 start. Would definitely eat there again.",2
"I pay almost 120 month in fees for our family of 5 but it is sooooo worth it. Just the two hours per day of free childcare for my 3 kiddos is worth it. I love the group fitness classes, the place is always clean and pretty well stocked. The cafe has yummy smoothies and the pool is lush. What else could you ask for in a gym?",2
"From the greeting upon entering, to the knowledgeable and attentive staff, everything was excellent about this visit. The customer service is over the top and a fresh treat when so many other places in Vegas do not care about their customers. The meals were prepared very well, and the owner even visited with us several times to make sure that everything was to our liking! Great fod, great service!",2
Seriously such a cool place with an awesome atmosphere and delicious beverages! I was recommended to try the butterbeer latte and it was FREAKING delicious. They certainly know their stuff here at the Daily Press CLT and you will not regret stopping by! Ask for suggestions as they are more than willing to help you out. They know their coffee! Seriously! ,2
Dined in. Food had obviously been sitting out all day at the buffet. Lo Mien was soggy and had unidentified black grit in it. Broccoli was clearly unwashed whenever it was cooked. Finally I ordered beef with broccoli and the meat looked pale like chicken but tasted to gamey to be chicken or beef. First time I ever wondered if I was being served cat.,1
"It was ok. The Drunken Noodles had too much green bell pepper, which is an inexpensive common vegetable that I didn't know was cooked so much in Asian food. David Wong's Fried Rice was a dollar more than what the restaurant's website indicated. The hard menu an online menu aren't the same price wise in it's entirety.",1
"The first time we ate at Red Devil, it was good. Not fabulous, but solidly good. Since then, the pizza seems to be greasier each time we visit. My husband will tell you it is delicious and couldn't be better. My husband also has very wonderful things to say about the bar there. As the designated driver, I can tell you that the food has gone down in palatability.",1
"Writing reviews on las Vegas soul food places is just making me very upset! I have nothing positive to say about this place, m m soul food, or jimmys market. All bad. I had the fish and chicken and was not impressed. With anything. Ok I take it back the ketchup was pretty good. Other then that I coulda had a v8.",1
"We call this place a Texas Road Kill. The staff there needs to be trained on how to seat people. You are better of going in small group, say party of two or three. We have had such bad luck with the wait time too long even with the reservation. Since then,we made up our mind that we would rather lick our own toes than go back there. It's not with it.",1
"Tried this place on opening day because of the freebies on behalf of my father. We have always gone to Luke's yes, the 16th Street location too and needless to say, I was disappointed. Had I not been to Luke's before, I'm sure my experience would have been better. Too commercialized, mid range tasting food. I won't be back on my own that's for sure.",1
"If you want a great hair experience go see Erica. She will actually take your suggestions and give you advice is she thinks it won't work. You won't get a bad cut or color job with her. nShe is certified to do a Keritan Smoothing Treatment and if you're looking for that special day or night makeup, she uses M.A.C. products.",2
"I've only been a tenant here for 2 days but I'm already very impressed. I put in service requests to fix the ice maker, change the ac filter, and to inspect the ac as it wasn't cooling that well in the afternoon. All 3 request were complete in a matter of hours after submitting them and all items work to our satisfaction. The people in the office are also friendly and more than willing to help.",2
never had any complaints or reason to get postal on the people here. they were fast and did their job well. i think people who complain about the post office workers in general are impatient because they are used to instant gratification. or they procrastinated and are stressed because they need to send something out.,2
"I went to this buffet on a Sunday. The price was too high for what it was. Crab legs was the main attraction. They are so small, its not worth working for your food. nHOWEVER, I must say I thought I was in heaven when i tried the bread pudding that was in a throw away foil cup that sat on a hot table. I can't describe how delicious this was! wow!",1
"I love panda but this place sucks. There is barely any sauce on the chow mein, they didn't cook the onions through and said they never do. They added extra chilies to the spicier foods and that burned going down. Not going back! I think they are confused about whether it is a chinese or mexican restaurant.",1
"Love this place! The red curry is great, as well as the mint pork. Yum! Their regular 1 10 spice level isn't THAT spicy so I usually get a 10 and it is just right. The service is great, maybe not overwhelmingly friendly but fine. The interior is not what you would expect from the strip mallish exterior as it is warm and inviting. Certainly a regular Thai stop.",2
"Wow, just tired the special hot sandwich they called it the ""Oliver Special "" . simply amazing! I've been going to this store for lunch a while and pretty much everything on the menu is awesome, but this one was worth Yelping about. Meats and cheeses are sliced for you when you order. Costs a bit more than Subway but worth it! will be back!",2
"Love the shop. Love the baristas. Love the coffee. Hate the smokers who swarm the outside patio and make drinking coffee outside hell for non smokers. The friendly staff has no interest in enforcing the non smoking city law and Starbucks policy! If you are a non smoker, it is inside or nothing. If you smoke, the patio is open!",1
"Small, hidden gem in the valley, tucked in the back of a shopping plaza but worth finding. Ron is helpful in finding the best match for you and the sound you are looking for without trying to up sale anything. The prices are right, no need to shop online anymore. I will definitely be returning for future needs and wants .",2
I went There many times. Price is gd but i need to go there twice to get what i want. English speaking makes it even harder to communicate n getting an.expected hair cut . When i told i didn't get my desired look some stafs were rude. A professional did my hair relly wrong i went a student to get it fixed. N the professional was very upset at me. I don't wan to go bk.,1
"This place was good the sushi rolls were very fresh and tasty, and the food from the kitchen is good as well. Lunch portions are not out of control, and the restaurant is well designed and decorated. I think it would qualify more as a Japanese restaurant than Asian fusion, but it's worth a look nonetheless. Give it a try if you're near Southpark Mall!",2
"Wow! What a huge difference from our last visit to Hula's! We went on a crowded and very busy Friday night. We were seated immediately by a very polite hostess. I asked our waiter about gluten free options and was given a new menu, and told if I had any questions he would gladly ask the chef. I had the Spicy Chicken Taco, they were great. Definitely adding this back to our list for future visits.",2
"Having gone to cooking school in San Francisco, I can say I have had much better. nThe quality of the crab can be beat at my local supermarket, The atmosphere was overkill for the experience I had. Anyone that has ever been to a real seafood house has to agree that the ambiance is not a party with servers dancing around the place. nFor the money, I would rather go to that red shellfish chain.",1
Do not order the all you can eat cod fish fry . Its horrible it was cold and mushy so I sent back and it came back the same terrible! My wife ordered ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel it was was cold when it came they also brought it back I suspect they just microwaved it . The server was apologetic and didn't charge for the cod. Very disappointing!,1
This place is ok I usually order the lox bagel with cream cheese and the wife gets the egg cheese sandwich neither sand tends to have much flavor for some reason the bagels are good though the help tends to be young and or non friendly unless your a regular and with that level of service I will defenitly will not be a regular,1
"Great sandwich. Confusing menu for a girl from Minnesota that doesn't know the difference in a hoagie, grinder, sandwich, etc. Whatever it was that I ordered was good. The pigeons were nasty and fearless. Vegetable lovers beware there is an extra charge of a dollar each for lettuce, tomatoes, etc. Meat and bread and cheese come standard!",2
"I checked this place out recently after watching a documentary called Forks Over Knives and I attempting to increase the amount of raw plants in my diet. What I believe was the owner of this place greeted me and continued to give me a lot of information about the lifestyle, he was polite and informed. I would recommend checking this place out.",2
It is really good. Love the fresh local ingredients and changing menu. I also love the that you know how many calories more or less that you are eating. The food is delicious. You won't be disappointed. It has good ambiance. I would recommend their great tasting flatbreads. Staff is great and they take reservations!,2
"Slightly awkward. But decent. kinda over priced, kinda over hyped.but thats what i expected. Went here for my Beautyface's birthday dinner. I think we would try to visit the lounge next time, but I doubt we would return for the whole dinner thing. Should have sit on the patio instead of the stuffy dining area. Just not our cup of tea. the mansion is nice though.",1
"I recently stayed at South Point and it was awesome! They gave us a 2 for 1 coupon for the lunch buffet and the service was awesome. The food was so so, BUT THE PEOPLE ARE REALLY NICE. They refilled our drinks constantly and were polite. The food I would give 2 3 stars, but the service and deal made the experience even better.",2
"Typical neighborhood pizza place, but it does the job! It's a cute little shop with sidewalk seating and ice cream window in the summer. The inside isn't anything special but it seems clean. The staff is busy but not unfriendly. Usually though, we order delivery. It comes within the normal amount of time and the pizza is good.",2
"Wouldn't go here again.clean place, everyone's working but the food isn't really good. I got chips and nacho cheese.they are plain without much flavor. nThe 2 soft tacos I got where chix and Chicharron.they were both really small and soggy.I got them Togo so I reheated them in the toaster oven making them a little better.the salsa is quite spicy.honestly I'd rather eat Taco Bell. Sorry.",1
"I got a groupon for a month of tanning at any Celebrity Tanning location. I work all over the valley and went to 3 different locations and not one place was I impressed with the customer service, not friendly at all. I only went a total of 4 times because the staff just was not welcoming and seemed annoyed to have you come in and looked you up and down. This was not just this location.",1
"This place is on point. Top notch eyecare, quality Eyewear, Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Nice location, and good vibes. I like the bagels next door. What else, yeah don't be a sucker and go elsewhere Optic Gallery is the place. They also have another location on the other side of town, both awesome places. All I can say this place is better then Lens Crappers and most Doctors in town.",2
"I come here perhaps twice a week for the past few months. The lobster bisque and salmon are great. Apart from that, try their salmon and tuna sashimi. If you're at the sushi bar, you're in and out with a wholesome meal within half an hour which is great when you're travelling for work and need a quick meal",2
"I came in to get a car decal. It was supposed to be done by 5 pm. I came in the next day to pick it up at 12 pm, but it wasn't ready yet. I was told to come back in an hour and a half. When I came back at 145 pm it still wasn't ready! What a waste of my time and gas, it's not like I live across the street and can keep on coming back for a damn car decal. 1st and last time here!",1
"Yes it is delicious. The filet mignon is tasty and seasoned. My steak had a little melted butter on it or you can have some melted blue cheese on it either way and I have had both .its amazing . Nice and dark like a good fancy steakhouse should be I enjoy the atmosphere and the ambiance. The wait staff is nice and thorough and although it is expensive, you get what you pay for.its GREAT!",2
"Wow. This place is just awesome. Cheap slots and table games, 2 beers, 8.99 steak specials.why wouldn't you come here. The food is delicious and the people are friendly. This is seriously the best dive bar I've ever been to. Also, there's Karaoke starting at 9pm. Skip some of the hustle and bustle of the strip to come by enjoy affordable food and stick around to gamble the way Vegas used to be.",2
"I wish there was a better distinction between the vendors who are selling straight from their farm and those that ship produce in. I'd love it if they sectioned it off and had better signage. It can be slightly overwhelming going from one stall to the next among the crowd. It is busy! Some take cards, mainly cash.and a few checks. Bring your own bag!",2
"This has to be one the worst customer friendly locations I have ever been at. There are roaming packs if staffers that you literally have to stop in their tracks an on average, two cashier's on peak times that have no concern about expecting a line. Five times I have been here out if convenience, but I will make the drive to the centennial home depot from now on unless things change.",1
loved it! Built your own is always winner everybody like different food! the service was great and the food was tasty and it's was my first time and Probably not the last! I tried the bowl With miso broth with the chicken roasted and with the other stuff they put in their.Very nice place love the concept deco and very clean and peaceful Bravo J'aDore u00e0 la prochaine mes amis! ,2
"Pretty good. They have actual poppy seed buns that taste like what I remember when I used to go to Chicago. Had the Chicago style dog with chili cheese fries health food, in other words. Good all around, though I thought just a little on the pricy side.about 10 for the fries, hot dog and a drink. Nothing fancy here, but good for what it is.",2
"This place sells half off discounted tickets for shows comedians, singers, Cirque du Soleil shows, male revue shows, etc and restaurants buffets! They have a few television screens that show you what they have discounted offers for. The wait can be about 15 20 minutes to purchase your tickets but its definitely worth it. They have a few locations on the strip so make sure to keep your eyes open!",2
"The pizza was pretty good. I thought it was a little expensive, but it was exotic enough to make up for the slightly inflated price. So why two stars? Jupiter's has the second worst service I've ever had, mostly due to the surliest, most hostile waitresses I've ever interacted with. Just awful. I'll never go back.",1
"Extremely disappointed in their so called gluten free pizza. Ive been to sammys grill and it was amazing so obviously they are using a bad recipe or dont have someone cooking that knows how to make gluten free. It was cold for one, and tasted like cardboard.if u are going for G free dont.go here! Terrible",1
"Guys do great work and extremely flexible with their hours. They met met at 4 pm on a Sunday for the tint, which no other place could do as they work out of their own garage. Had a little bubbling on one of the windows and they replaced it no questions asked. Would recommend them to a friend no doubt.",2
"This show might not even deserve 1 star. nThis was my first cirque show, and my boyfriend's second. This show was hard to follow, unimpressive and WAY too expensive for what it was. My boyfriend kept falling asleep it was so boring. It was not what I was expecting, and would have much rather spent the 200 on something else.",1
"Unfortunately. not a repeat for D G. it was on the way to the movies about the only highlight of their location. connects to movies Rave ramp. Do not like leaving negative reviews. just not my cup of tea. I will say, however, that for football season the large screens will not disappoint. your constant companion, deirdra",1
"The sushi is fantastic, especially the Godzilla Roll the tiger roll and Dragon roll are great too . They have fantastic Pho as well as the noodle bowls. The sushi bar ambiance is cool. My 6 year old love the Edamame Yakitori sticks zucchini and chicken . My wife loves the summer rolls Chicken Vermicelli bowl. The service is excellent.",2
"Are you serious? What are you doing? If you've given up, if you've just said "" ! It, let's just get panda "", or you've got a gaggle of screaming kids that won't shut their mouths unless you immediately fill them with orange chicken, then go ahead. But if you have a choice, and a working brain, go to one of the dozens of local chinese places in the area. I recommend China Tango.",1
"Started off with the Kiwi Chard sangria which was excellent. I ordered my favorite the Posole mmmmmmm so yummy. It has cabbage, radishes, pork, and hominy and the broth is a chili lime and it's just great. I then had the chili ceaser salad which was pretty good. The dressing was spiced up just enough.",2
"I have stayed here three or four times since I wrote my first review. The place is consistently good. I had a chance to hang out in the lobby lounge as well as the attached restaurant bar District . Both top notch with nice people about both staff and clientele . Expect, of course, to pay hotel prices for your libations.",2
"Not a great experience when you walk in the door of a business and an employee says ""we're closed. "" There were still a couple of people in the store, so I asked if I could take 2 minutes. He begrudgingly agreed, and then proceeded to keep a hawkeye on me while I shopped. Needless to say I did not make a purchase.",1
"Whenever we're in town we always stop here. It's the best coffee in Phoenix. I always get the Iced Bella Mocha and teenage son gets a latte with extra shots. Each time we've stopped in we've had a different barista, but they've all been efficient and fast. My only wish is that they had a shop in Tucson!",2
"Uggghhh, this airport I've had to fly in and out of here a few times for work and it's hell. As if I didn't get enough of the slot machine noise or long ass lines already .The lines here are way, way long, the only perks are the free wi fi inside while you wait for your flight and a few decent places to get snacks. Otherwise, avoid like the plague.",1
"It seems like they've looked at most of the details but do you really think I need or will use an old Antiquated FAX machine. NO! I won't. A coffee maker or a means to heat water might just be a nice guest amenity. Yea, the rest is fine but schlepping 15 minutes yes, it takes that long to get to coffee downstairs early morning no fun. nWon't be back.",1
"Ron has been a lifesaver to us remodeling our bathroom into an accessible handicap Roll in shower. If you ever need a contractor who has expertise for ADA, and believe me they are hard to find, you want to call Ron. He not only does good quality work, he is very helpful and easy going. And is he very reasonably priced. I will be calling him for future work, for sure!",2
The pizza its yumtown! Delish and if you want to throw a party they have a 30 inch pizza and it's not just big it's delicious lol you get a strong sense of a family owned business which I enjoy and it's pretty quick service. I have to admit I love the pizza here so these are totally bias words here. So just try it yourself I dare you not to like it.,2
"A few years ago I would have reccomeneded this place. I do not know what has happened but absolutetly no one in the place cares any more. From the service reps, the service manager, the cashier and the guy that siad ""I think I'm in Charge "" or the GM that never responded to my inquiries. Stay away! If you go here you deserve what you get!",1
"Pittsburgh deserves this restaurant. Food and atmosphere some of the best in the city. Rivals some of the coolest places in LA. The only the negative I can say is service is so so, but Pittsburgh in general has pretty average service. Make sure you make a reservation, and get the beef tar tar. and get over the bathroom, its not that big of a deal ",2
"I decided to use the walk up window instead of the busy drive thru. I waited 5 minutes before being served. The girl who ran the window was greetful. My name was called to pick up the food and I had to wait behind a customer who was ordering so my food sat there for a while before I helped. I chose the veggie chicken tacos which were soggy,bland and with a boring unvariety vegetables.",1
"My family and I was looking forward to eating here, we really liked some of the Lee's Sandwich stores in Orange County, CA.and had high expectations for the one in Vegas. The sandwiches were bland and stale just so bleh. I decided to give it a second chance and the sandwiches is still below average.",1
Had to go get the Grill Cheese Burger after seeing all the commercials and ruining my diet! Darn commercials. These honestly looks better on TV and I imagined it tasting better. It was basically I bacon cheese burger with extra cheese. The cheeses were not thoroughly melted enough for me. I should have still home with a grill cheese sandwich. The employees were very very friendly!,1
"I love Pho , but my experience with this place was horrible. The hosts was rude and didn't get the order correctly. How is that possible? The pho tasted like it was out of can base soup. What was truly disgusting was the worker who was obviously sick and wiping his runny nose. Seriously? After seeing that I stopped eating and left. Eat at this place with caution. Seriously!",1
"One of the best shows i,ve seen in vegas.crew was great and on point.very good show writing.this was expected from a cirque show as the other shows are also awesome.the michael jackson songs are all remixed very nicely.show has great light show cordination.and they dont short you on that money spent,its a full 90 minutes of entertainment.",2
On Wednesday I went to the Pandora at Fashion Show Mall to buy the dice. The bracelet was a recent BD gift. The very helpful sales woman showed me the newest charm.a silver dangle with the Welcome to Vegas sign! So I bought both! She also rearranged my charms to showcase the dice. Very happy with charms and service,2
"The food here is mediocre. The entrees come out all swimming in melted cheese. Its hard to differentiate the individual foods, just like every other mexican place. Why is this the norm? A very small pitcher of sangria cost 16 and this was nothing special too. Could make better at home. Quality like this makes me just want to cook and drink at home. Even blast some mariachi music too!",1
" 12 for a regular bottle of Corona. Isn't this more than enough a reason NOT to go to this piece of shit place ? 20 dance is fine. But it aint fine when all the while you are pestered to go get the 100 private dance which if you say no to, are given the looks that say "" ok this is ur last dance.gonna go for some rich ass bugger "" . These guyz just rip you off. Stay Away !",1
"I have been going to this place for the longest time. Not only is it near my house, but the polish lasts awhile. I have been to other places where the polish washed off the next day. These people are nice and remember my mother and I everytime. They even remember what type of style I like my nails to be done. I definately like this place",2
"Please do not use! I am looking into legal action curious how many others got screwed like I did! My wedding was June 29, 2014 I paid 2800 for a package I have never received anything I don't have my photos or my video! Why would a company do such a thing?!? Just horrible! Not one person will return my calls half the numbers I have for pp no longer work!",1
This place has the worst god awful crappy beans on earth. Even outside at the drive through it smells like cheap toxic cleaning products. Did someone drop a urinal cake? What keeps Filibertos in business are Twentyfourseven hours and drunk people. nConveniently located in every lower middle class Phoenix Metropolitaeighborhood. Urban legends are built upon places like this.,1
"This was by far the WORST experience that I have had at a Jimmy Johns. The staff appeared to not enjoy being there, I asked for hot peppers and my sandwich cut in half and got home to realize that neither happened and my sandwich barely had any dressing. It was also freaky slow. Disappointing because I typically love grabbing a Jimmy!",1
"Great food! I got a polish dog and fries and pleased my mouth with grilled goodness! They have plenty of toppings you can add and the workers were all friendly. I would have loved to leave a 5 star review but I think the food is a little overpriced. That being said, I will definitely be coming back. It just won't be a frequent thing for me.",2
Great looking restaraunt and bar with open kitchen and large staff who were mostly male and easy on the eyes.Group shared several appetizer and were impressed anything with schrieners sausage is a can't miss .I ordered the mussels which were excellent.and ordered the s'mores w bacon dessert which was delicious although a bit difficult to manage.,2
"I've been to plenty of Qdoba's and this is hands down on the bottom of the list. The manager on day shift is very rude. Rest of the staff seems highly uninterested in being there. My work ""lunch buddy "" and I always used to eat at Qdoba before we changed locations, we tried eating her several times and just got tired of the manager and staff attitude. Won't be going back.",1
"The view is great! Definitely worth going up to see. They have a gift shop and a small bar area. There was also a sketch artist up there. You can walk out and really take in the view rather than only seeing it from behind the windows. The elevator personnel are great gentlemen, very helpful and polite.",2
"Chicago styled pizza thin crust, ""square cut "" is delicious. Have gotten a few wrong items in delivery, but they've been good about correcting the waiting time is tough . Double check your order before the driver leaves! Usually very friendly staff. Great pizza Italian beef Gardinera is great. Items on the higher end of pricing for ""pizza type food "" but flavour is wonderful.",2
"2 stars because the workers were nice. The calzones are the size of a football, but it came out with sort of warm bread, but the cheese everything inside was cold. As well as the calamari that we ordered the little bread they gave us. the marinara sauce was completely watered down. Shouldn't even be considered sauce. Definitely not coming back.",1
"Love this place. Can be a little hectic on the weekends, but I usually order for pickup anyway. The square pizzas are ok but pretty greasy so I avoid them. The pizza with the truffle oil is swimming in oil to the point where its a little inconvenient. The calamari, meatballs and eggplant pizzettes are KILLER. The salads are whatever. but why are you getting a salad at a pizza place?",2
"Unbelievably poor service. Was picked up by a cab driver who asked to be payed up front. When I told him no he kicked me out of his cab on the side of the road well out of my way. Not only that, but he insulted my intelligence repeatedly. Will never use this service again and warn anyone thinking of using them to seek transportation elsewhere.",1
"This place has went downhill. The service is still pretty good with a friendly staff, but the food is same ole stuff. I went for lunch multiple times over last year and they do the same food everyday. My most recent visit revealed that they are putting less out there to choose from as some stations were closed. Not worth the price anymore.",1
Cold food cold service. Go to Egg and I instead. They can't even be bothered to actually spread your butter on your toast before serving it! Cold eggs cold hollandaise sauce on your Benedict.Total waste of good money! I've eaten here at least 4 rimes thinking that it might get better after opening. Guess not!,1
"I've been a long time customer of Azool. They have the best steaks large meals on CareFree Highway. The drinks are cold and they have a nice selection. I always sit at the bar, it's where the action is. If your expecting a nice mellow place to eat then get there earlier in the day. It is a bar first and a grill second.",2
What ever happen to customer service? It seems that this term and banking at least with Chase are not allowed to exist within their walls I had a deposit eaten by the ATM on Sunday march 4 and today Tuesday the Acting manager and CSR told me they only count the machine once a week on Thursdays. Kinda makes you scratch your head and go hummmm What else can I say?,1
"We used Service King to get our MR2 Spyder repaired because they were on the ""best of "" list for our insurance company. Wow we can see why! This company is awesome! The people are incredibly customer friendly and professional and they did an excellent repair job on our car. We highly recommend this company for any collision repairs.",2
"Great food, I have tried many things on the menu and The Pilgrim is one of my favs. I ordered The Royal once at the one on Dobson. Wasn't much of a fan of that on. Think I prefer the taste of a burger on a bun rather than in a pasty. Really like the space and a great looking bar, it has a dark feeling which I think is great.",2
"In one word, amazing! We had chicken and nutella crepes. We also had a brioche and coffee. Everything was done to perfection. The only complaint is the line. Not that a place like this, in Vegas, wouldn't have a line. But the staff seemed less than efficient. Especially the lady making the crepes omlettes. But like I said, the food really is perfect.",2
"This is a nice small library. I live in Chandler and this is the closest Phoenix branch to me. I reserve my books online, they notify me via email when they are ready to be picked up, and I go pick them up. Easy and convenient. I like that because it increases the selection of books I can get since you can request any book within the entire Phoenix library system.",2
"This place is absolutely awful. Rude employees ate the worst but there are a long list of problems, long lines, no chairs, people always cutting in line, special vip passes for certain people, doctors playing favorites with regular patients. If you can avoid attending this place please do. Just so you know they say 50 dollars that's only if you donate twice a week in a regular basis.",1
"Fresh Mama is conveniently located under Vegas Hot! yoga studio and is a great place to re energize after a work out and grab one of their healthy smoothies or a Spicy Thai wrap to go home with. You don't have to be vegan to enjoy this place! I wouldn't stay there to eat after hot yoga personally, I'd be slightly unsanitary. ",2
"Asian Fusion sounds about right. The food was horrible, they're serving dumplings and rice at a premium price. If you have money to spend and want asian food because you don't know what it's really about, then this is for you. I guess they have a great business plan geared only towards Americans who believe in this crap. On the side note, they offered great service and I really liked the ambience.",1
"We were seated fairly quickly, and received drinks shortly after. But then it took almost an hour to receive the food. It was not that busy in there when we first got there, but within 30 minutes the place was packed with people waiting to be seated. Overall the service could have been better but was not the worst experience.",1
"Mario did a great job on the dishwasher. HOWEVER, when repairing a lamp that originally cost 339.00 was broken, Mario offered to replace it. New lamp cost 149.00 and we were told that he would take the cost of the repair for the lamp he broke, from this price. Hmmmm so I pay to fix a lamp that you broke?",1
Very unprofessional. Wanted to order a cake for my daughters 16th. Birthday. Staff did not know pricing and had to call the owner. I gave them my information and was told that I would receive a call the next day. Never received a call. Wouldn't have them bake a cake for my dog. So sick and tired of people being unprofessional.,1
AWESOME upgrade to the suite and the room is so big and nice especially the bathroom I cannot leave this room! I paid more to stay at the encore and boy was I dumb. Next trip to Vegas I'll be here again for sure. Not sure about my luck gambling here but love the service the staff provide and the room is just awesome. That's all I have to say.,2
Great service from Olga! She even tracked us down in the casino to give me the sunglasses I forgot.so nice and definetly not expected in a place like Vegas. Fish tacos and blackened chicken sandwich were both good. Nice view from the patio. Groupon worked fine. Everybody was really friendly and I would definetly recommend it to a friend.,2
"Not too please with the results of this car wash, got my car wash here with full service which was 15.99 and it looked like it just got a normal car wash which was 2.99. They hardly vacuum the floor and there was still dirty spots left from all the bugs. Friendly staff but the result wasn't all too good, it wasn't worth the money.",1
"I've rented cars in pretty much every major city and have never run into this problem before. The sales associated attempted to force me to buy additional insurance raising the rate by 200 and saying my umbrella full coverage insurance wouldn't apply in phoenix. Its BS, don't use them and you do not need their insurance if you have your own.",1
"Last night was my first time here, and I enjoy Ingrosso. That aside it was too loud, waaayy too loud. It was impossible to talk to my friends. The venue itself seems thrown together. It's too large now I see why Marquee closes off sections as it gets later and why Light closes the balcony off on slow nights. You won't see me here again.",1
"Quite simply the best doctor's office I've visited. Dr. Patric is caring and actually sits and talks with me about what's going on so I don't feel like an inconvenience, but rather a respected adult patient who is an active participant in her health care. You simply will not find a more caring practitioner in Phoenix.",2
"Overpriced and overrated! I ordered the ""fried oreo sundae "" and I received it halfway melted. I also ordered a burger which tasted mediocre at its best. My boyfriend ordered the frozen hot chocolate, and that also tasted disgusting. I truely wonder who hired the staff because the customer service, is horrible.",1
"Only giving one star because zero stars isn't allowed. No stars. I ordered a falafel sandwich and a chicken shwarma sandwich. I asked for no pita with the shwarma, they charged me for a platter 6 more. And still used pita SEVENTEEN dollars for some crappy rice chicken and a mediocre falafel sandwich and on top of that there was a hair. Thanks but no thanks. Total fail.",1
"Eh? This place is definitely nice and the pool outside makes this area a good place to chill after dancing, but the long line and entrance fee are definitely not worth it. Go to a club where the line isn't as long and hang out with your friends because if you go during memorial weekend, the guys better have money or else they won't get in.",1
"Gotta love Panera's pick 2! Definetely try the baked potato soup! I love Panera. From their addicting pastries to the yummy sandwiches, it's always a hit. like the chill atmosphere here too you can come inside and study or get some work done FREE WI FI! . The employees at this Panera are awesome! Super friendly and helpful! ",2
"Do NOT come here! It is a complete scam. I signed up for a tanning membership and when my credit card was stolen and I had to get a new one I was charged 100.00 for having issues with my account. No one notified me of this, no one gave have me a copy of the contract. I only found out because I came in to tan. It is a rip off. The beds are disgusting. The staff is rude. STAY AWAY!",1
"Many of the stores are a bit expensive but it's a lovely mall and very clean. It consists of both an indoor section with a movie theater, Macy's, and many smaller shops and boutiques. There's a strip outside with lots of restaurants, an aveda salon, and other stores. The front parking spots are sometimes hard to find, but there's always spots in the garage.",2
I visited this place with a large group of friends Friday night. It was a lot of fun. The only thing I didn't like was we had tickets for free drinks but they were only accepted at one of the bars and when we got there there wasn't anyone working it. I gave up waiting and bought a drink at the other bar.,2
"She is amazing and worth every penny! I had a baby only 7 months prior to the shoot and my confidence was very low so I was reluctant to do this. However, I was amazed at how awesome Jodi made me feel and how gorgeous my photos turned out. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking to capture their true beauty ",2
"This place is terrible! No matter how good of a deal you think you're getting, it's not worth it to deal with their customer service. Technicians know what they are doing, so it's a real shame. Went twice and both times argued with me that my groupon was not valid. And many problems with the up sale they sold me to add another area. Definitely find another spot!",1
"We go to Vegas all the time. This restaurant was not ""off the hook "". Service was so so and the food was good but not great. I'm not big on second chances in Las Vegas as there are so many options. Just like our experience at Old Homestead Steakhouse in Caesars Palace don't waste your money. But I have faith in Guy Fieri go bigger to make it better. I love your shows!",1
"Rude! Went to the window at 8 53 and no one was around, a minute later a girl comes up and says they're out of boba and no hot drinks because they're about to close. I said, ""ok nevermind "" since it was such a burden to her. As we were leaving, she was actually happier that we weren't getting anything, which would've caused her to actually work.",1
"I can't believe I walked past this place for three years. What is more sad is that many of those times were likely while I walked into Subway across the street on a Tuesday afternoon to drop 5 on a Veggie Delight. Little did I know I could get a delicious, warm, and fresh vegetable hummus pita across the street for a little over a dollar. At least I have many more Tuesdays ahead to take advantage!",2
"Seriously, undoubtedly GOOD. Carne, Pastor, Pollo, Shrimp, Fish tacos or burritos or salads or taquitos you just cannot go wrong. Tortillas, mexican hot dog, tortas, homemade salsas all above and beyond what you would expect. Friendly owners with a story and a smile.all great. This is not an average taco shop. It is truly extraordinary. .Best Taco Shop in Phoenix. Period.",2
"This place is just plain OVERRATED. They wouldn't even trade out meat in a dish for something else without charging me extra, that or the lady taking my order just plain didn't understand. Still, waste of your money. Go in and see the ideas they have for the specialty dishes and then go home and make it yourself.",1
David Wongs Pan Asian is hands down one of the best new discovery of mine! First of walking into a clean mom and pop restaurant these days alone is a plus let alone being genuinely greeted by the owner and staff. Then the menu is pretty traditional except for the filet mignon pho which is delicious! Best of all the price are so cheap! Well done Mr Wong,2
"This is the second time I've been to Farmer Boys, and definitely the last. The first time I had a club sandwich, which was ok. This morning I had the 3 egg combo a congealed lump of eggs, hash browns that were barely cooked, and soggy 'toast' with margarine. Fresh food and quality ingredients are not a Farmer Boys standard, nor is the level of care when preparing food. Will not return.",1
Tremendous food in a cool atmosphere. Trust the wait stuff on what's hot and fresh as far as meat offerings are concerned. The menu changes very frequently based on availability. Try something different. The fries are in best of Charlotte category. The pork belly appetizer is a don't miss your first time. The bison burger was tasty full of flavor.,2
"I've had this place clean my suit for awhile now, so last week I decided to bring in a wool sweater of mine in also. Big mistake. I got the sweater back and initially it looked fine, but today when I went to put it on I discovered it had 8 holes in it! I will be taking this to the owners, and most likely never coming back here again.",1
"I love everything about this concept. It is remarkably adorable inside and has a great outdoor area too, not to mention it is home to food truck Friday best day of the week! The food is pretty good as well. I love love the fresh and uniquely blended juices and the fact that it is all local. The owners of St. Francis killed it!",2
"Maybe I went on a bad day? I went with a group of friends here and got the rotisserie chicken with rice along with some fried plantains. I love plantains, and there is nothing you can do wrong with them, but the chicken on the other hand. Man, talk about dry, dry, dry, dry, dry, and dry. It was dry and flavorless. It was the worst. Also, my friend got sick after eating here.",1
"I called on 3 10 2013 with regard to my boyfriend's Window's Nokia 1020 phone, he broke the screen on it.Nathan was very knowledgeable and informative. Unfortunately, Nokia doesn't allow companies to change out the parts.as of a month ago. But again I would recommend Nathan and his shop to anyone! Thanks again.and when ever I need a cellphone fixed, you will be the first person I call!",2
There is an employee by the name Amanda and an older lady with short hair. They are the rudest immature people I have ever witnessed in a business before. I loved coming here until I encountered their horrible presence a couple of days ago.I will never return to such a horrid place. Bruinswick here I come.,1
Been there twice so far. First time was good but second visit was pretty bad. Waited at the door for 5 minutes then decided to seat myself. Asked for more dip and chips three times before we got more. Asked for no peppers on the fajitas but yes on the onions. Sizzling plate came out with nothing but a bunch of dried up burnt chicken. Tamales and the wifes salad were good.,1
"I had dinner here this evening Tuesday July 9, 2013 . I had cold wings and warm beer. I mentioned my issues to the manager on the way out and he acted like I was asking him the square root of a made up number. To add insult to injury, my boneless wings were less like wings, or eveuggets, more like crumbs and they cost 8!",1
"Glendale Glitters has blown up since I was last there 16 years ago. It was a mad house of people, cars, stroller and pets. I do wish people wouldn't subject their dogs and pets to a crush of people like that. Even some children were getting overwhelmed. But the venue was great and well planned. My favorite discovery was Hey Joe! food truck. Check them out! good stuff.",2
"Its been a few years since I've been to 54. Normally you run into the people who just attended a concert event at the arena. It appears that they dont enforce the dress code. There were some patrons who were barely covered up with so called ""clothing "" Positive Decent music. Negative Too small and Pricey If you're lucky, you may run across a celeb as my one friend did.lucky itch! ",1
"I started coming here over 5 yrs.I started as a client of Juliennes' but now I am a client of my daughter Kayla! All the girls here are awesome! They did my hair and moms for my wedding and they all attended my wedding! I love this place.from nails, to hair, to waxing, to skin care.come see Kayla.and the salon!",2
"After suffering through a lot of crappy Great Clips cuts, I found this neighborhood barber shop right across the street from my house. The main barber here is a young Russian guy with a NYC accent. He was extremely thorough and gave me the most perfect 2 cut I have ever had. He did a straight razor finish, all for 14 cash only. Highly recommend",2
Dr. Terrie Tran is the type of dentist you dream about. She is accomplished and very talented. She has an impeccable education. I've had quite a few varied procedures at Dr. Tran's and have been completed satisfied with each. I pay Dr. Tran the highest possible compliment I've recommended her to every one of my friends and associates.,2
"We like this place a lot. We've had take out from here at least 10 15 times and find that the food is consistently good and tasty. WE're big fans of the Fish Taco Mountain which you can get without rice if you are eating low carb . It's delicious and really filling. Frequently, I can't finish the whole thing. We're so happy that they've moved into the neighborhood.",2
"Clean, quiet, sophisticated bar with an amazing view of the strip. As the elevator opens up to the 23rd floor, the mild, fresh, floral scent immediately hits you. Low music, great lighting, and a unique cocktail selection. The snack tray they bring out is a nice touch sesame crackers, wasabi peanuts, and roasted almonds. Waitress was very pleasant. We would highly recommend this lounge.",2
Horrible service tonight usually pretty good but not tonight. Food took 30min to get out and they weren't even busy. Asked for boneless wings and got traditional that tasted 8 days old. Not sure if its because its late they were trying to go home but regardless we WILL NEVER BE BACK! This occurred 17JAN13 between approximately 2120 2215,1
"Im writing this for the wife so not sure how helpful this will be. Im a man. I have a big manly beard. I dont touch my eyebrows. For her though, she really likes this place. They do the eyebrows right everytime, never a long wait if any at all , and free bottled water! The dance music station they have on is most entertaining! Its like Paki Hindi MTV! nCant go wrong here.",2
"Wahoo's is a mediocre. No salsa bar like Ruibio's or Baja Fresh, and they charge for each little side of salsa. What kind of taco shop mexican food place nickle and dimes you for salsa? Fish is dry and flavorless so it needs to be drowned in salsa to be enjoyed. Best thing about this place is the location and view from the bar, go to have a beer but eat somewhere else. Can't recommend.",1
"I have always enjoyed going here for breakfast brunch. In my younger years, I would go for the hotcakes. So thin, large, and crispy on the edges. Yummmyyy. I will write an update to this review.after I go to it again hopefully next month.But if it is as good as I remember, you won't be sorry going here.",2
Me and my husband were wondering around downtown trying to find a place to sample the infamous Montreal poutine and Frite Alors did not disappoint! We got a smoked meat with added brie cheese and an order of lobster poutine. It was comfort food at its best. The most delicious poutine I have ever had. Add a glass of beer and it's perfect. Service was great friendly and fast.,2
"Like the thin crust pizza, esp the spicy chicken sausage. Good pasta, spaghetti and meatballs. Love the meatballs. Kid likes the mac n cheese. Can get a ""side "" dish of pasta at very reasonable price if not very hungry. Good bread also. nNot a fan of their tiramisu though which I usually really like at other places. nGood for takeout also.",2
"Service was good, but the food was really bland. I had 2 sushi rolls and my husband had the chicken and steak hibachi. The sushi rolls didn't have much flavor and the hibachi was extremely bland. Almost as d they didn't season anything before putting it on the plate. We have had better Japanese food and probably won't be back to this place. Our waitress was friendly and pleasant.",1
"Sudo clean. Kitchen they provide comes with no pots, pans or silverware which kinda defeats the purpose of having a kitchen in a hotel room. So if u come bring ur own. The bed is most uncomfortable thing ever.like sleeping on floor. Was here for two weeks so went and purchased a 4 inch foam pad just to deal wit it. Is stay else where.",1
Very trendy coffee place on McGill. nLove to go back With friends its so beautiful inside ! There is the little shop at the entrane With fine and unique products. nYou Can even take out pr u00e9pared meals . they all look good ! nCoffee is de licous nBreakfast are a sure bet! nThey have big tables for group.,2
"The real deal when it comes to NY style pizza.I think the owner's are New Yorker's maybe I'm wrong.i just get that impression , so that makes it even better. We've been eating their pizza and wings for 4 years now. Something I like just as much as their pizza and wings is their consistency. It's always the exact same food, time after time. We never get any surprises.",2
"I wish I could have loved this place because it has a great location and inviting atmosphere. I was too disappointed that when we ate there on a Sunday they were out of quite of a few items. No avocado or gluten free bun today?!? I tried to look past that an ordered a protein style burger instead. It was good, not anything to write home about.",1
"How can you not love a place that has 3.50 drinks with umbrellas and fruit garnishes and the best cocktail sign ever?! I have only ordered the drinks, the chicken wings and the pad Thai and I loved them all. So far, this is my favorite pad Thai in the valley. My husband likes Pei Wei's version better, which I don't understand . I order mine not too spicy here, because otherwise it is quite spicy!",2
"Meh, there are so many better Japanese buffets out there. The sushi here was not good at all and the rolls looked more or less the same lots of fake crab meat and ahi. My highlight was that the dessert aisle had some really good creme br u00fbl u00e9e. Oh, and FYI, I noticed a sign on their door saying they're closing this location sometime early in 2014.",1
"Great food and restaurants. Cool rooms. Small casino. Terrible front desk and customer service computers were down at check out and getting through to someone by phone has been impossible. I had a few rooms booked and over 1000 dollars of charges were billed twice! Weeks after our trip, still waiting on hold to speak to their account receivable department.",1
"The food was good but the absolutely RUDE service ruined the experience. After all the people behind me in line had already received their food, I asked the cashier if mine was almost ready. They forgot! So after waiting 15 20 for my food, I complained and the employee couldn't care less. She actually argued with me and said that's the normal wait time. Worst guest service ever!",1
"i know what you will think he gives a two star review and eat there again! What's wrong with that guy? Well I wonder myself. I was very unhappy with my second visit there. They only have terrible beers on tap, and they don't have a list of decent beer bottles. How hard is it to carry some decent brews, fgs. We're not in the 1980s anymore. the food Tacos was mediocre too. so, beat me if I go back.",1
The breakfast burrito with chorizo keeps me coming back again and again. For lunch try the Kahlua pork sandwich. If you're not into that they always have specials and many other tasty options. The service is great too unless they're slammed . We typically avoid that by sitting at the bar if necessary. Otherwise they have a chill patio. Try it out!,2
"Very disappointed. Went in for breakfast. Nobody at hostess station for 5 minutes and then flagged to a booth where we sat for another 15 minutes without a hi, hello, here's some water and I'll be with you in a moment but the two groups that came in after us got coffee and their orders taken. A little acknowledgment goes a long way and we ended up walking out.",1
"My wife and I got free tickets for Donny Marrie. We were by far the youngest people in the crowd, and the few that probably didn't know a single song that was performed. Donny was also a no show, so we got a total Marrie show. She is an exceptional performer and amazing live. The show is definitely geared to an older audience, but was definitely entertaining and fun to experience.",2
"As someone that grew up in NY state, restaurants touting themselves as NY style aren't going to immediately impress me. However, these guys are doing things right. Went as part of a decent sized group about 20 people for a tweet up.service was great, and the calzone that I had was pretty good. This location doesn't have a ton of seating, but carryout is available.",2
"Me and the family stopped by after ice skating the other night. The food was good. Hubby had the Rambo dog, daughter had the Rambo burger. Other daughter had the 2 egg 2 pancake breakfast, and I enjoyed the Woodstack sans bacon. The kids had fun playing with the magic 8 ball from the toy table. We live pretty far from the restaurant, but if we are in the neighborhood again, we would go back .",2
I love Richard Sandoval restaurants. Maya and Pampano in NYC are two of my favorites. So when in AZ I had to try out La Hacienda. One look at the happy hour menu and I was in love! The best El Diablo Margarita for 5.00! Prickly Pear Margarita 5.00. A whole assortment of tacos 5.00! Ceviche was awesome. Guacamole amazing!,2
"Some of the best crab I've ever had. I'm a big fan of king crab but the snow crab here gives any king crab I've had a run for its money. I like the side of chow chow with my crab, pickled green tomatoes. The Abita purple haze pairs great with it and the hush puppies are very good. Sweet tea is also worth it.",2
"We go here all the time but this might be the last. We went to the drive thru and ended up waiting 10 minutes when there was only one person in front of us and for the second time the drink tasted horrible. All it tastes like alka seltzer which I know I didn't order, I'm just warning you, I'm tired of this place messing up",1
I had Eco Fresh clean my carpets today. I recently got a puppy so they needed it. They were on time and had the job done in an hour! I found them on GroupOn and paid extra to have the deep cleaning done. The carpets look great and the smell is awesome! No chemicals! I will definitely use them again!,2
"Too tired to type a review but I'll update this later. Anyways update about their AYCE, I know they started off with unlimited appetizers, then three per person, now it's two appetizers per person. The appetizers were very small. I know it's an appetizer, but it is much smaller from the pictures posted. Not the best shabu bit you get what you paid for. Give it a try, why not.",2
This place would get 0 stars if the pulled pork sandwich wasnt spot on. salads were very mediocre. not sure why this place gets the reviews it gets but it is fast and has some unique features such as the charging station. food was blah. got the tomato soup mac n cheese couple diff salads and a carmel cookie. You can get better soup from the can and better salad at sweet tomatos. not for me,1
"risky buying auto parts at these places. waxes, cleaners,etc okay. clutch master cylinder for jeep cost me three hours of my time, tow charge to repair shop to complete, then the shop finding out the part had an internal leak probably from ""made in china "". cost me 5 times my do it yourself cost to get it fixed by a shop.",1
Asked the bar tender for a glass of water b c my friend wasn't feeling well and he said they only serve bottled water for 7 a piece! Asked to talk to the manager Mike Laguna and he wouldn't serve me water either even though I showed him its Nevada law that if you serve drinks you have to serve water on the house. Won't go there again and being a local I will tell everyone in Vegas not to!,1
"I eat here quite frequently as the Renaissance is favorite for my top execs. nThe ambiance is perfect for that deal closer dinner or even a power lunch, I've done both, and the service has been great. The filet Minion is to die for, I have it med rare and its cooked perfect. The wine selection is extensive, and best of all the staff remember your name. A ",2
I like the transformation they've done here. It's much more upscale than the prior bar. They have a decent beer selection. We were very pleased to see Anchor Steam on tap. There are a few different video poker options including triple play. I've been here a few times and they seem understaffed. It does take a bit to get your drink.,2
"It's no wonder VCA has 5 stars they are amazing, we take our Dog Max there, he was rescued and was sick soon after we got him, they have taken such good care of him, have been more than helpful in faxing us his records adursing him back to health, if you are looking for a great Vet this is the place to go!",2
"Love this place. I feel like I'm in a WWII, secret meeting place in England with the low ceilings, archways of brick and dark interior. Spot is large, too. My only complaint is the volume of the jukebox. One would think, based on the perceived atmosphere of this joint, that you wouldn't need to shout at one's companions while enjoying a drink. This should be fixed.",2
"Overall not impressed, the food is not all that great and the atmosphere treats itself bigger than it should. Pork dim sum was bland and the 16 flank steak noodles were drenched in salt . At the very least the staff was extremely nice and I hear the tofu dim sum was decent. Just not my place I guess",1
"I wasn't impress. We sat along the canal and that was the highlight of the meal. Chips and guacamole was decent. I had the Tres Tacos, I thought it was bland and also they were those small tacos, I was expecting something more hardy. Even though the place was dead, service was slow. nThis might be a OK place for drinks, but I would skip it for dinner.",1
"Beware, this place is ripping you off, in my opinion. Because my gas gauge is broken, I fill up based on miles driven since last fill up and know how many gallons are needed to fill the tank with great accuracy. The one time I bought gas here, the pump said it dispensed about three gallons more than my tank should have been able to hold.",1
It's time to write a review since we eat here often. I think their burgers are some of the tastiest in town and reasonably priced. Their shakes and root beer floats are the best. Clean dining room and always someone around to bring out the food to your table fast. Like SmashBurgers better than Five Guys and Fats Burger and they are way better than McDonalds and Burger Kings for sure.,2
Walked to this joint this afternoon and was delighted by a delicious coffee and coffee cake. This is just the kind of establishment the northside needs and I am glad to have stumbled upon it. The staff is courteous and the space is cozy and inviting. Stop by here for coffee or breakfast next chance you get!,2
"Pizza here is not exactly edible, unless you are not Italian, in which case you might even like it. nPizza is not extremely difficult to make, and it is ridiculously cheap. For this reasons it should be twice as big and half as expensive. nAnd the topping, good Lord.that was so scarse that I thought it was a joke.",1
"All the Stussy goods you could ask for, with customer service comparable to the workers at Supreme NY. Don't expect to receive a head nod or ""what's up "" when you walk in the door. Gave my cousin a hard time, unfold a shirt and they'll be following you around the store until you walk out. They're too busy admiring their fixed gear bikes and looking like their busy on their Macs.",1
The restaraunt is very noisy. Parking lot is oddly configurated.the waitress was friendly . However cold air was com I ng in from the side entrance. The food was good portion reasonable large green beanns were very fresh. The sauce on the meatloaf was sweet.we enjoyed their pretzels were good.after we had our d I nner service was lacking and our dinnerrt sizes were small,2
"I will not recommend this place. It has a small dance floor that gets crowded and you will not be able dance at all. I got 2 drinks, a shot and a mixed drink. The drinks didn't have any alcohol, it was like ordering a sweeten iced tea. The DJ played bad music that instead of make you want to dance you just wanted to sit. However, if you are looking for a place to sit down than this is it.",1
"Don't order the salt and pepper calamari! The picture looked so much better than the outcome. So disappointed. The batter was gross. Ordered the roasted chicken plate, and honestly the chicken was really dry. Other than their customer service being excellent, their food really needed some improvement.",1
"Party with MaxVegas! You wouldn't be disappointed. I had a blast with my friends on Saturday. The hosts know how to party! And ladies, they'll look after you, so go crazy and get drunk free drink passes and more drinks on the party bus! I would definitely party with them again when I go back to Vegas!",2
Worst Home Depot I've ever been to. Needed a sheet of plywood cut and was told by 3 different people someone would be with me. I waited for 30 minutes for something that should have taken 5 minutes at the most. The store was empty and there were employees near the front in a circle on their phones. No excuses for their inability to help.,1
Frankie Marino is a great entertainer and he will not disappoint you at all. This is like my wife and I's 4th time seeing him as we are locals here in Las Vegas and you can get free tickets by going to this website www.showtickets4locals.com We go to this show as often as possible as Frankie has every kind of music inside of him from Elvis to Sinatra.,2
"This is a great park! We took our 6 year old here in the afternoon prior to the red eye back to the east coast. She had a blast, and we had a moment to enjoy the warm weather and the only patch of green we saw in 6 days. The equipment is new, the grounds were clean a few empty water bottles laying around , and they have active security.",2
"I had the best time at this show. My sister and I purchased a groupon. The irritation on the night was that in order to go with out a reservation that night, we had to pay an extra 20 each. The theater was tiny nAsk for the show, I loved it. Excellent actors and dancing. The host was funny, plus they handed out free Jell O shots. I had fun!",2
"Nice decor, poor service and the food is over priced and poorly executed. We were here with a party of 5 and nothing was exceptional. One tapas dish was really fishy. A few not bad. Main dishes were skimpy with no attention to quality and presentation. I do not recommend Ibiza at all. A waste of money.",1
"I had a great experience at Burland. After reading the other reviews on Yelp, I decided to give them a shot. I took my watch in for repair, and within minutes the battery had been replaced and it was as good as new. They also cleaned my wedding ring while I waited. If you are a fan of supporting family run businesses, this is your jeweler. Great service, great place. I will definitely be back!",2
"1. Get the Pizza Bianca. Figs and Arugula and Goat Cheese and Yum. 2. Get the homemade bread, jam, and butter. Simple and Delicious. The outdoor seating provides a fun spot to eat and drink in the summer months, and since there is so much seating I have never had to wait long. Great place to take your parents as a college student since it looks onto the Cathedral of Learning.",2
"Save Mor Beer, you make the ridonkulous PA liquor laws slightly tolerable. They carry my beloved Abita brand, and have a huge selection of many other local, national and international breweries. There's a walk in cooler section with your normal beers, nothing fancy in there though. nPlus, their commercial can't be beat!",2
"First time They asked if we had been there, guess the confussed look gave us away. They brought sample cups gave us a few samples each walking us though the process. They were exceptionally nice and didn't make us feel like dummys. LOL Great service! I got strawberry yogurt with fresh strawberrys and kiwi. SOO good!",2
"For my bachelorette party weekend, I wanted to send some stuff to the hotel instead of bringing it with me on the plane. I called the hotel and asked them how it would work. They never once mentioned a 'handling fee' to receive boxes. Granted, it was only 35 but I still feel cheated with all these ridic fees there's a 23 resort fee when you check in .",1
"Simply the best I've found in Vegas great food, friendly and efficient service, fun location its a dressy kind of place well worth a 2 hour dinner. Had the stone crabs, wedge salad, surf and turf huge lobster and shared desserts. All were very good to great. I can definitely recommend you go here and will hopefully be back soon.",2
"I came back here for dinner with my wife. And honestly this was a much much better experience this time around. nI had the half lobster, followed by the foie gras terrine, and grilled lamb loin. nMy wife had the tomato soup and the roasted chicken. We then shared the Lemmon tart for desert. nEverything was very good, especially service. Our waiter Ross Was his name I think, was awesome.",2
I just ordered a knife from their online store. It turns out their picture was wrong and I got the wrong blade. I wrote them and Tiphany immediately sent me a prepaid FedEx label to return the knife and express mailed me a more expensive replacement at no cost. I'm very satisfied with my experience with them.,2
"4 stars just for the cheese curds. My food has always been good here, but the cheese curds are extremely unique and better than any other curd out there. The breading is different lighter than most and the dipping sauces are very tasty. I have been tempted to visit Madison from Milwaukee just to get some of these curds.",2
Had a serious burger craving today and just had to stop in. I love that I always get seated immediatly and the staff is very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. It's a great family friendly joint but be warned that they make the whole dining room join in on singing the birthday song. I only wish the burger were a little more juicy.,2
"Do not park in the lot next to the suites even if you are guest! Security guard LaRosa will take your room key and throw it in your face and tell you ""to get the fuck out of here "". and then get in your face. Can't make this shit up folks. true story. Soooooooo disappointed, cannot believe this is what customer service in Vegas has come to. berating and harassing paying guests! smh",1
"Disappointing experience. Took a long time to get the food, and everything I wanted was not available and had to settle for something else. The person working the register had to go and check what was available in the back. Took way too long. I have been here once before and had a great experience, not sure if I'll come back.",1
"The 5th time I went on Saturday. Service and plating is inconsistent. A 40 seat casual BBQ should not run on reservations as it effects capacity management put stress on staff and clients. Some managers better than others, but the one on Saturday should consider working outside the hospitality field. Unnecessarily awful service experience last. Lost client.",1
"This is my favorite salsa in the bay area. I get their steak tacos, pico on the side, side of cheese as well. Chop up the jala pep pep they give you, add it on there with the cheese, pico, scoop of salsa. Don't forget to squeeze that lime on top. BOOM! I like the greener salsa only. Cannot vouch for anything else on their menu.",2
"Oh I just love the clothes here. I mean LOVE them. Wish there were more shops like this in Ireland. I do greatly dislike how expensive the stuff is, but it's such a niche you either want it or you don't! believe me I want want want. The shop itself is bright airy the sales assistants are lovely! Go visit it if you're into the rockabilly scene!",2
"The best breakfast place, bar none! I love that it is a local, non chain place and they do everything delicious! The french toast is to die for and the plain and simple eggs, bacon, potatoes is perfect! My husband and I split these two dishes and it is plenty. We always leave stuffed! Be sure to make reservations for a Sat or Sun morning breakfast, otherwise you'll be waiting at least an hour!",2
"Greg, nOwner of Coyote blinds,is exceptional, in all of his work details and customer service.We use his company on all of our projects as a remodeling company. nOur customer simply love his professionalism, never can say enough about. nyou cannot go wrong with Coyote blinds.if you are looking for blinds or shutters, nlook no where else, but too his company for god prices and service.",2
Healthy options if you don't feel like cooking after leaving the gym! I used to come here a lot after my workouts since it is in the same shopping center as LVAC. Everything has the calories listed for the health conscious people. The food is good and a little pricey which I don't mind since it is a lot healthier than Mickey D's.,2
We frequent Flemings alot and have since they first opened. We have ordered a variety of foods and everytime it is perfectly cooked. The service we receive is outstanding. We have never had to wait more than a few minutes to be seated. We haven't ever had any problems with the food or service. nI think that this is a five star restaurat.,2
"Came here for a friends wedding. It's like old world Mexico. Very quaint and nice. It is a bit dated. Some floors are caving a bit. But. If you are hosting an event they have lots of outdoor space. It is not expensive, service is ok. Personally. There are much better venues. But for those with a tight budget but want something clean and nice. Go for it.",2
"I have been here several times and I have not had a roll that I didn't love. I've tried most places for sushi in Henderson, and this is the best one I've found. I recommend the Pearl Special Roll and the Playboy Roll. Both are fantastic. I seriously can't think of one negative about this place, I am making it my regular sushi place.",2
I like the gym but their hours need to be better. Opening at 8 am on weekends is ridiculous. They also need to open by 5 am on weekdays but open at 6. Last Saturday literally 20 people were standing out front at 8 40 am after they were supposed to already be open. An employee never showed up to open the doors. I left so I have no idea what time they actually opened.,1
The Vegless omelet is awesome! If you want great food made with the freshest ingredients this is your place. If you'd like to get right in and out try going midweek. The service is always good and the wait staff is always friendly. Parking is sometimes an issue during busy times. Otherwise I would've certainly given them 5 stars!,2
"Simply awesome i was looking for an artist close to home, affordable, and detailed work. I found exactly what i was looking for. They do custom work i did not have Ruck do my tattoo but still awesome! I was a weenie with the pain but they were patient with me and very cool about it. Funny guys verybdown to earth! Will definately be coming back!",2
"As I look at all the reviews, it seems like this place is a hit or miss. I have been going to this place for so many years, never had a problem. I will say my absolute favorite thing to get is the steamed pork bbq bun, and i normally get it when its made fresh anytime before 11am. Had the trio bun also, which was good. Just a great selection of pastries and bread overall. Can't go wrong!",2
"7 of us visited for lunch on a Saturday adults and teens . Service was very good and everyone enjoyed their entrees. The lunch entrees were just the right size and ordered off the regular menu and the portions were very large may want to consider splitting between two people. Based on this experience, we will definitely be visiting again.",2
"Beef tongue and squid are a must! But what the hell am I doing wrong when I order from the set combo meal that includes fried rice and both times I did not get it?! Not that I could have eaten it because the amount of food you get is enormous. Still, I would have enjoyed rice fried on the same cast iron dome that the marinated pork belly was just on. That's flavor country my friend.",2
"A 50 haircut for 19! These guys really take their time to give you a professional cut. Ask for Chris, he is an absolute artist with the scissors although all the barbers at the shop are talented. When you walk through the door at High Rollers expect a trip back in time to when going to the barber shop was a relaxing experience. The hot towel at the end will say it all. ENJOY!",2
"Ok, so maybe it's because I have a little bit of status with US Airways that I'm biased for and lately, their planes that I have been on have beeewer albeit typically smaller planes than some airlines . The staff has always been professional and friendly in my dealing with them. So, for me to be a happy camper, I just need newer planes, friendly staff, and good connections. They give me that.",2
Born And Raised is like a way cooler hipper and more caviar vibe of CHEERS. u will walk in and see familiar fAces. Pretty ones too! Go there. the food and vibe is great. They have happy hour food as well as reverse happy hour for the vampires working Vegas graveyard shifts. Did i mention lots of tv's? And well.i like it here.and i like the ahi salad. A Lot!,2
"My french fry barometer registered a ""what the what? "" I know I sound a little pissy, but there is no excuse for lukewarm fried food ever, especially at noon in a food court. Jeez, I get a gift certificate every year from one of my many jobs and while I appreciate the gesture, I think I would appreciate some proper fried food more. Cold onion rings. you know my panties were in a wad.",1
"I have had the pizza to go and it was AMAZING! I have also been there for lunch and got the calzone, also wonderful. The service was a little slow for being a lunch place down town. It took about 20 mins to get our food and 15 mins to get our check. I wish it faster for the lunch crowd but still the food was wonderful so I will go back.",2
"Excellent place to stay, especially for the money. Booked on Priceline for about 60 a night. We were very pleased with our spacious and comfortable room. We had a great view looking toward the western mountains. Our room was clean and well appointed. I would have liked to see a microwave in the room or at least a refrigerator but there was an ice machine. The beds were super comfy.",2
"Sat at the bar and had a delightful solo meal. Dinner is a bit more expensive than lunch, but they do have a 5 per item menu. On which, you will find the best greens beans ever better than the casserole even ! The food is fresh creative and you will find something for every one. I gave it four out of five stars bc of price and ambience. Food is a five! I look forward to another visit with a group.",2
"Their chili cheese fries are to die for! Be sure to ask for a side if fry sauce to either drizzle over them or at least just dip the somewhat dry fries in at the end. The burgers are tasty, but I'd prefer I Out's small patty burgers over these especially for the cost. What keeps me going back is the cleanliness of the restaurant. The friendliness of the staff, oh and did I mention the fry sauce?!?",2
"Creative fois gras dishes and fresh yellow tail tuna sushi pieces are delectable. Fantastic sake list. Excellent service from the friendly bartenders. Great place to eat dinner solo at the bar while reading and people watching. I'm not a fan of Vegas but when I'm here for work, this is easily my favorite place to eat and chill.",2
Ran into this place because co worker was hungry. nThe service was good very fast . but the food was ok. nMy co worker i went with is Indian and he did not care for his dish . some curry dish. nI ordered something simple egg noodles with wonton. nIt was ok. nothing that stood out for me. Give it a try and take care of the service people . they work really hard.,1
We stopped in here for Dinner and were able to get a seat right away on the patio! There are heating lamps out there so was not chilly at all. We had the crab cake appetizer and Loved it was cooked crispy and delicious. I had my favorite salad Which is the Luau Salad and is a huge portion! Haley had the club sandwich and was excellent as well.,2
"We went there last Sun for brunch. nI'm impressed with the atmosphere most. nLove their unique fun kind of foods. nI didn't remember what we ordered but there were nshrimp sandwich, grilled spicy pork, and crab omelet. nIt won't take long to get the food here and they all are delicious! nWorth stopping by ",2
"Really great place. My friends and I had low expectations of the food, and thought we would at least enjoy the view. WOW! The food was great. And we all loved the smart service from Skye. She is great. My friend is a local and had never been here, but it is now a must! Fixed price lunch is a great value as well.",2
"This is a regular for our family. Not fancy, but good food. My husband always orders the Chirashi Sushi, and my daughters and I usually order off the sushi menu. My girls are not really into rolls, so we order Nigiri Sushi, and the happy hour is awesome! Service is so so, lots of turnover in waitstaff, but we keep coming back for the great sushi.",2
"By far the best laundromat Ive been to. Im new in town and needed a place to launder my king size comforter. When I first walked in the very friendly and helpful owner greeted me right away. He immediately offered me change, advised me on the machine and even told me how long it would take. Plenty of seating and very clean.",2
"My chicken sandwich didn't taste very good and the amount of chicken was really skimpy compared to the 7.00 I spent for it. My son liked his burger. The cashier girl who handled our money was also handling and filling the to go cups for the sauces and if you know anything about touching money and germs, bacteria, and sanitation, the fact that she did NOT wear gloves completely grossed us out!",1
"This place is ridiculously amazing. I went in and couldn't decide what I wanted. it all looked way too delectable, so I had them pick out some items for me. Was not disappointed. I'm hooked. Very friendly staff, and you can tell they love what they do. Left with a smile, and was even happier when I got home and stuffed my face. Thank you, arai pastry!",2
"Been here twiceactually In the summer of 2011, some vendors suggested drinks and dinner here. Fusion TexMex fare. The grilled steak Carne Asada tacos with carmelized onions were good but the sauteed mushrooms were out of this world and were only 6. It was crowded and busy so the staff did their best considering. The Limeade was great. The second one was even better!",2
"If you wait an hour to get seated, the food and service better be good. Well the service was pretty poor. At least the food was good once we all got it. Also we were there for a birthday and the waitress knew it, but did noting special for it. However she blew us off when we needed something to go and sing at another table.",1
"They are literally within sight of walking distance from Jimmie and Joe's, they also make an enormous slice of pizza for lunch. Big Boy makes a far better slice for less. All I can say is Well Done! Stop by, grab a slice, order a pie.don't make me keep this place in business all by myself. This is REAL Neighborhood Pizza like I remember from my days Back East.",2
"No air conditioning in the back portion of the gym which includes bathrooms, showers, sauna, etc. It's been out for months. Their solution Prop a door open and hope some cooler air from the locker room gets in. Really uncomfortable. They promise their days from fixing it and yet month after month in the summer, no less it remains unfixed.",1
"Don't get me wrong, the food was good. Decent. I mean, it was typical brewery type food burgers, steak, etc. I thought the waitress uniforms were pretty cheesy, and in general I kind of hate Toby Keith, so maybe that colored my perception of the place. The food probably warranted a 3 but the service was quite slow and not super friendly, and again.just as irritating as a Toby Keith song ",1
"The food was so bad there it's not even funny. Almost every dish has the same vegetable assortment and taste. The drunkeoodle there was the worst one I've ever tasted. The fish didn't taste fresh to us, and they serve skimpy portion dishes. In addition, the bathroom was very filthy. Will never re visit again.",1
"We have had A LOT of framing done over the years at various frame shops. Hands down, this is the best frame shop in the Madison area! Paul, the owner, is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. His work is excellent and prices are incredibly reasonable. Also, he completes the projects fast. He has finished most of our projects in 7 10 days. The last frame shop we used averaged about 90 days.",2
Worst place to take your car. They wanted to replace my whole clutch for over 800 because my car wouldn't start. I took my car to another car place and they said all it needed was a plastic plug behind the clutch for 96 bucks. These idiots don't know what they're talking about and they just try to rip you off. Wouldn't take my car here if it was the last auto repair shop on earth.,1
Well let's start by saying Service was good. No complaints there. So this is not one of those bitter posts you see. The reason I give 2 stars is b c of the service otherwise I would drop it lower. nNow let's get to the skinny. nTHE FOOD It honestly wasn't all that great. We had a few different plates b c it's a Tapas Small plate style restaurant.,1
"I was told Drybar gave a better and more long lasting blowout than Primp and Blow a blow dry competitor and so I booked an appt there at 11am before an important event from 12 3pm . My blow out did not even last through the event. It looked terrible in photos. Having tried both places, I would recommend Primp and Blow over Drybar. Waste of money.",1
"Who doesn't love Chicken Tenders? NOT ME! Lol Nice atmosphere GREAT personalities from the staff! I tried the OHANA Bento. Chicken was cooked perfect lightly battered, crispy outside moist inside. A diverse choices of sauces which were all appealing to my palate. Good job Chef kudos to the Staff for the excellent service! m ",2
"I work right across the street from Antonio's Salon Barber Shop and have been coming to him for over a year and a half! He is absolutely fantastic. He knows exactly what I like and the style of haircut I am picturing. He is very professional with his work, reasonable with his prices, and gives a specialized haircut exactly to the T! I rate him 5 stars.",2
"The place was packed on Saturday night, usually a good sign, but I think people are going to get over this place quickly. Strange service, greeted with ""What's up. "" nothing more. Food is tasty, when it's cooked, I got served a burger that was still raw. considering it's a burger joint, that really shouldn't happen. I won't be back.",1
"Native wings rock they are one of my favorite places in the valley as they have a great variety and always are great. Last night I went to go watch the BCS Championship game and get some wings and they had a pizza special 6.99 for a 14 "" cheese pie so we got that too. All the food was great and the game was on every tv along with ample volume. Overall a great time and great food. Thanks Native",2
"So thankful for the Levine family their generous donation of this hospital. This is a state of the art facility assisting children in the area. nClean floors, friendly staff excellent doctors. nI definitely will choose this hospital if I have the need when I have a child . I recommend it to those with children.",2
We came here to meet some friends of my friend. We only had drinks and yes they were made extra drunk for us. The 45 price tag on it made me wanna pass out. I understand its grey goose and red bull but shiiiiiet. I could have made a better concoction in the hotel room for pennies compared to that. The misters on the patio area smell like ass. The bartenders ed hardy monsters. ew. NO thanks. ,1
"This strip mall is probably the busiest corner among the rest. It has few of my favorite places in the same plaza, Changing Hands, Trader Joe's, Express MiE, and Wildflower Breads. I love Changing Hands for their book events, authors signings, amazing selection of bargain books, and other fun gift items. I wish I live a little closer.",2
"Took my car here because my window wouldn't work. After negotiating back and forth they fixed it for a decent price. When I got my car my electrical locks didn't work and neither did my manual locks. Brought it back and the guy said, ""are u sure your manual lock is supposed to lock? "".seriously dude. They ended up fixing the problem but don't bullshit your customer.",1
"Great customer service. They always treat you like they know you or at least remember who you are when you walk in. They'll beat anyone's advertised price and do it with a smile. They take appointments, which is a bonus. Mornings and weekends are usually super busy, especially during snowbird season.",2
"This place is great! I've gotten acryclics and pedicures here several times. They are always more then accomadating to do the crazy nail art pictures I bring in. They also have the largest selection of already done nail art to pick from, I've ever seen! I'm really satisfied with the service they have provided!",2
"Let's just say, it's refreshing to step into the lovely Planet Hollywood and to be embraced with quality decor, great service and overall good energy and vibes. I come to Vegas all the time, since I am from Los Angeles, and have tried a variety of places.I have two high strong recommendations 1 planet hollywood n2 aria nHave a great Vegas trip and good luck ",2
"Overpriced and not a good flavor on food!,.I eat at very good restaurants and I don't mind spending couple hundred dollars, but. 6 for a jarritos drink?!?!?!?!. No way!.the soda is .99 cents at the store, PLUS my friend got the runs from the chilaquiles. I would never comeback or recommend it to any of my friends.",1
"In town for business and discovered this little gem of a sushi place downtown. Great sushi, and Tony, the owner prepared some really great dishes for us! They could have used at least one more wait staff person last night as our server was overworked, although remained very friendly! I would definitely go back next time I am here, which will be next month!",2
"The entire expiriance was really good for me. The location is perfect. Food was great! Ambiance was really nice.and food.fodd was really good. Service was really good as well. We went there for brunch and I was pleasnently suprised. I am for sure going back. The patio area is so nice, especially when weather is a bit cooler outside. I would for sure reccomend this place to anybody for brunch!",2
I was at this Sally's 3 different times and oh my god the people working there are soooo rude! Even the manager is rude! I think she's even more rude than everyone else there! I was there yesterday an I got the same shitty service! Never going back! I rather drive few extra miles to another Sally's .,1
I have to say this place was pretty good! It was the first time I've tried this kind of food. The dishes were a good portion. The waitress was nice and the environment was relaxing. The only thing I'd have to say is to make sure to sit inside the restaurant. We had people smoking heavily who sat at the booth next to us and the waitress didn't do anything about it because they were her friends.,2
"thought I would treat myself for lunch. I have eaten here before but it's been awhile. I ordered the pad thai. Not only was it expensive, but it was the worst pad thai I have ever eaten! There were only 2 shrimp 12? .and they were not totally cooked. Some of the chicken was rubbery. i will never order this again! what a disappointment!",1
"Excellent place to buy snack foods, frozen meals, delicious frozen desserts, and a generally healthy food. Compared to the California Trader Joe's, I miss the wide selection of beer and wine and the cheap liquor, but that's a problem with Pennsylvania in general and not with Trader Joe's. I've also felt that the cashiers at this location were not as friendly as the ones I remember from California.",2
"This is the worst Applebees I've ever set foot in. So ghetto that they have a police officer that just hangs out in the restaurant, definitely something I don't want my children seeing. nThe staff is rude and disrespectful. Never will I set foot in here again. nI can't believe corporate hasn't shut this place down yet.",1
"I seriously love this store. I wish I didn't live so close because I always find myself here without even realizing it. I can always find something here that is awesome. I pretty much never leave empty handed. They have some really great deals and prices on clothes, shoes, accesories and purses. Their high end stuff is still kind of ridiculous though. But that could just be my broke ass opinion.",2
"Every single table was dirty, there were 3 people working, 2 weren't actually doing anything, only 3 people including us 2 were here. CLEAN THE TABLES! Disgusting, dirty, lazy workers. We had to sit at a wobbly table just because it was the cleanest out of all the dirty tables. And to top it off, the Asian lady was rude.",1
"If you only want some drinks before the game, then come here. If you want something to eat, go somewhere else. We waited 45 minutes before we walked out. When we told the bartender we couldn't wait, you could tell this happened all the time. He didn't even put up a fight. I would only come here for drinks, but then why not get drinks where you can eat too? So I will never be back.",1
"This place is a terrible excuse for a restaurant. Service, poor, food below average and the management is very unprofessional. They would rather argue that the food is good rather than accommodate unhappy guests. BTW dont order the shrimp tacos, they are tiny canned or freeze dried and nasty! Dont waste your time or money! Thank god this is not a chain.",1
 Left Disappointed Just As I Expected Was hopping to be impressed. little has changed. nSame O Same O with New Ownership. won't survive either. nI'LL CONTINUE.going to Taste Of Chicago.where 5.68 tax gets you a dog fries and drink. Better yet . the Valleys best . for Italian beef and Hot Dogs n is CHICAGO HAMBURGER COMPANY on Indian School This place is just.not up to the COMPETITION,1
"This place is great. I had friends tell me about it and no one could quite describe to me what the food was like, now having been there I understand why. It is excellent and undescribeable. Its like the most magnificent hot pocket you could ever imagine stuffed with a variety of different delicious combinations",2
"I went here with family as we had a Groupon to use for the ""Ultimate Border Grill Experience "". It's a restaurant in the Mandalay bay. We sat outside and had a nice view of the hotel towers. Very pretty the atmosphere is very nice service was very good. We had nPlantain Empanadas nBrisket Taquitos nGreen Corn Tamales nChicken Poblano Enchiladas nBaja Ceviche nFish Taco Ensenada nAssorted Desserts",2
My original destination had changed and HERTZ price jumped from 360 to 1200 and all that was available was a Carolla. I called ENTERPRISE and was elated that the price here was only 550 for a caravan. Steve RJ had my mind set at ease while here. They were knowledgable quite funny and the comic relief was just what I needed to relax. These guys rock!,2
"Caffe Boa's summer menu is out of this world. The maple gazed steak with eggplant was amazing. I devoured it. My boyfriend got the spicy scallops and again, sooooo goooood! I can't wait to go back and try the squash blossoms and other tasty seasonal dishes. Great service, ambiance and food One of the best restaurants on mill.",2
"A bit overdue but I got Mike's name from another realtor that uses him. What a wonderful job he did on my rental property and also did a job for me on my personal residence. PROMPT, courteous cleans up and reasonable. I love getting personal referrals and Michael was a great find. nIn the process of referring him to a friend of mine Janet OkeHomeSmart",2
"When my parents told me this place was amazing. I knew it would have to be to please them. They were right, five guys has delicious burgers and the fries just taste like real potatoes so that is always a plus! Service was really good and they more options for toppings then most other places. Overall it was a good experience.",2
"Always down to trying new places. Having said that. not impressed with the pickle! nFood was below standard. I ordered the chicken pizza with sun dried tomatoes and fresh rosemary. First of all, no rosemary, secondly it came out wet! My crust was a soggy mess. nDefinitely not worth the price, or my time for a repeat visit.",1
"The nail techs Pattie and Leslie are professional, friendly and do an excellent job! I have never been anything but thrilled with services I have received! The prices are reasonable and it's a fun and social atmosphere! Also their stylist named Lindsey does amazing work! Go see them. you won't be disappointed! I wouldn't go anywhere else!",2
Walk in to the counter girl didn't even acknowledge that I was there. She was to busy playing around with here cell phone texting. She was leaning against the counter facing my direction. I had to say HELLO to get her to put down her phone. nFood isn't memorable and I'm sitting here right at the table in the restaurant writing this.,1
"We went to this restaurant this morning and were very disappointed. The service was horrible they never brought my decaf coffee, never checked on us and never refilled anything without us having to wave them down . As for the food, it was just average. As breakfast lovers, we were looking forward to trying out a new place. Unfortunately, we won't be going back.",1
"I love Baja Miguel's for lunch. They have a lunch special for 8.95, which consists of two items, beans and rice, fideo soup, and a margarita or substitute drink . Since I am usually here during my work lunch break, I get a virgin margarita, which is still delicious. They also bring out chips and dip pretty much as soon as you sit down.",2
"Not very good. Ribs were really fatty and could have used more time on the grill. I barbecue ribs and and know what it takes to make good ribs. Slow and low is the key. I ordered the ribs as attest to see if they had a clue, and they came up short. The sides were boing and bland,and the service was not great.",1
"I love firefly.Best Tapas in Vegas. Food is reasonably priced and so are the drinks. Don't forget to try the Sangria., and don't let the strip mall fool you either. The vibe inside the restaurant is always fun and hip with a lot of younger crowd. I have probably been to Firefly more than any other restaurant in town.",2
Went here about 20 years ago when it was newer and a good place for families to stay. I have to say they haven't changed much in the rooms in 20 years.! Very old everything not very appealing . The lobby and convention rooms are upgraded and decent but I wouldn't stay in the rooms again I could have stayed somewhere much nicer for the price.,1
"What a crappy ass ""club "". Treated poorly, the bouncers thought it was a high end club when in fact they were hurting for clientele. Extremely disappointed. Bouncer took away drink and threw it away because I a male had a sip of a female friends free drink. This place seriously needs to reconsider their priorities.",1
"DANG IT! my cubano was so good! it was recommded to me by the carhop. i wanted something on the sweeter side that was also strong. this came with 2 shots of espresso, cinnamon and milk. it was perf. i also liked the car hop. he was so cool. i told him it was my first time so he did jazz hands as a welcome. i also picked up a chai latte for my friend and she said it was amazeballs.",2
"Delicious sandwiches and refreshing salads! nI had the eggplant panini next time I will get it on ciabatta roll instead of baguette i think it could even be better with slightly less bread to inside part ratio , and crunchy salad has jicama and cucumbers . A perfect lunch! nI wish they would open another location and be open on the weekends!",2
The food really wasn't that great. The chicken tasted microwaved in the chicken curry dish we ordered. The customer service was dismal as well. They were pretty restrictive on their yelp check in offer. My wife and I usually split entrees. We were required to each order an entree. Most resorts in Vegas don't offer a fridge. I hate throwing away leftovers.,1
"What a surprise hit! We had attempted on previous visits to make it through Trop's Mob Experience and each time something wasn't working. Finally, after they revamped and refreshed, we visited today and were surprised from beginning to end. Highly interactive, lots of reality mixed with legend and an overall a fun time. Highly recommend.",2
First visit to a Hwy 55 Burger. This location is fairly new the staff was over the top friendly. Ordered their steak sandwich which had lots of meat but the sandwich appeared to be microwaved and it made the bread kinda funky. Fries were tasteless this was one of the few times I left more than half on the plate. I think it's an OK place for families fun decor.,1
"Un autre bonne exp u00e9rience Chez Bodkin! Cette fois avec monsieur Vincent qui a dessigner et m'a tattou u00e9 dans une espace d'environs 2 heures. Comme la premi u00e8re fois, il donne une petite espace m u00e9ditative durant le tattouage respire, inspire, accepter the pain and je suis tellement heureux d'avoir un autre beau tattouage de l'atelier de Madame Bodkin! Merci!",2
"As others have said, decor and location are horrible. The salad wasn't really fresh but the ginger dressing was passable. The soup wasn't horrible but I bet it was just a beef bullion cube. The chicken teriyaki isn't bad. Good portion size, small veggie portion though. Good alternative to fast food.",1
"Fat Tuesday is great for getting a quick buzz. Not too quick though or you'll get a brain freeze! You could always add shots and get more than a buzz. nThe one Underground at the MGM was great. Try avoiding the one in Caesars Place., its such a long walk! And the one on the strip next to Harrah's is pretty decent. There's other locations but these are the ones I went to ",2
"I agree. Going down to the food court alone is worth the trip. Well everything there is really good,but that's my opinion. All the restaurants there are all the best! If it's your first time going here either go shop than eat or eat than shop. Whichever choice you pick, you still get to leave with a happy stomach!",2
"We paid a 'resort fee' however the jacuzzi was closed, the deceiving swimming pool was nasty dirty. Our bed sheets did not look clean and my daughter left with bug bites.we filled a complaint but the only thing we heard was ' pest control said nothing was detected'. Seems like they do whatever they want.what else can I do besides never staying at that hotel anymore. Buffet was good though.",1
"I love this Bruegger's! It's like the others in the chain so you probably either like their food or you don't. But who doesn't like bagels? But I find this particular Bruegger's to be exceptional. The staff is always kind and attentive, and I'm in love with their tomato caprese bagel sandwich. They're convenient and delicious what more can I say or ask for?",2
I ordered the Cobb salad which comes with bread. I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I was going to. The portion is huge and between two people we couldn't even finish it. The rolls were good and I like how they served a pretzel roll alongside a regular style roll. It wasn't anything groundbreaking but I would order it again as I really enjoyed it.,2
"Yes it's sleek and beautiful, but the staff was totally bored and unexciting for a new espresso gelato shop like this. The quality of the gelato, although presented beautifully, was only average, and the prices are a bit much, even by Vegas standards. Instead, I'll burn a few calories taking a hike over to Caesar's and pig out at Payard Patisserie!",1
"The ham and cheese please and the turkey sandwiches were really good. Their side kale salad were good also. Neither me and my husband really liked the smoothies, he had the Green Machine and I had the Tropical Wake Up and they were quite bland. I would go back for the sandwiches and salad we shared a cup of the Kale salad . It is pricey but I really enjoy eating healthy so I would recommend it.",2
I'm all for quaint family owned and operated places because there is a lot of potential and undiscovered delicious dishes. This is not one of those places. They need to apply to be on Restaurant Impossible because they need an overhaul. Their decor makes no sense whatsoever and the food was horrible. Their chips and salsa was great but it's pretty hard to mess that up. What's up La Mestiza?,1
"Just walked up to the restaurant and asked the young girl wiping place mats on the out door tables if they were open. She replied with a very snotty ""nope! "" And went back to wiping. I said ""I am sorry, did you say nope? "" She replied ""yeah NOPE open at 5 00pm "" in the rudest tone. ummmm ok I will never ever come back if that is how the responses are toward possible new guests.",1
"Unnecessary frustration. nRoute made no sense geographically, as admitted by the driver and the dispatcher that I called as soon as I found out that after being picked up in the South Hills of Pittsburgh we were headed back into downtown AWAY FROM THE AIRPORT for 2 additional pick ups ""add ons "" that were last minute after my reservation. The driver was courteous and the 1 800 answered the phone.",1
What a joke. The target website which offers a feature that allows you to see which store carries certain inventory. The incompetent employees at this location insisted the website was not affiliated with them nor did they assist me in finding what I was looking for. The facility was dirty and most items were out of place. I will not be returning in any lifetime.,1
"I really wanted to like this place cause it's close to home, nice people and small biz. But now on 2 visits I cant say that I particularly do. Ribeye and steak Salad were ok, nothing special. Buffalo Chix wrap was gross. Buff sauce was way salty and overpowering. I couldnt finish it. Good fries. Nice service. but I dont think I will be back unfortunately.",1
"This is a great steakhouse tucked away just off 215 on the north side of town. It isn't extravagant or expensive. just really stinking good. Their steaks are high quality and cooked perfectly. They have an excellent wine list that isn't overpriced. No need to get dressed up to eat here, but you can if you want. Make sure to get the ranch house potatoes as your side. Delicous!",2
"Not a bad golf course had played before but my last visit I had 800 cash stolen out of my golf bag. I called and spoke to the GM , and another employee numerous times, and they said they would investigate and view their security cameras and NO ONE ever got back to me at all! Very upsetting that it happened and mainly the way it was NOT handled. they just don't care.",1
"I know most people come here to grab a drink before heading out for the night, I never have so can't comment on that, but I am a big fan of their taco Tuesdays. For 2 a taco they have a great selection that will appeal to anyone. And of course it includes bottomless chips and salsa, you will find me here most Tuesdays.",2
"The customer service is great and the portions are generous, however the chili cheese fries were overcooked and chili was not very appetizing. I also ordered a Reuben sandwich that was mediocre. Lastly I know this is Vegas, but 18 plus for both items seems steep. I don't mind paying a premium price for food when it's but this meal, did not meet the criteria.",1
To be honest I like that they take phone orders for pick up and if it's late and you're staying here hey go for it it's better than a microwave meal but Denny's is better and I'm not a huge Denny's fan either. I had chicken parm that tasted ok nachos that were similar to taco bell like I said nothing special but cheap and edible,1
I've been to dueling piano bars before and while I will say they didn't duel they sure did entertain the crowd. I liked the wide range of music they would play and the jokes kept on rolling. They kept the crowd engaged most of whom were pretty tipsy. Drinks were good and service was also good. I had a great time and will be back again.,2
"maaaaan i don't know why people are so bummed on this place! since i can't give half ratings i gave it a 4 when i really wanted to give it a 3.5. the food was good, the service was very nice and friendly. we had the tom yum soup and the pad sieu noodles. not bad! i feel like people might come here with hangovers and sassy attitudes and that's why the rating is so low.",2
"This is one of the worst McD's around. They are slow service, back up easily, half the time screw up the order and some crew members are pretty rude considering what their job is to serve . Not to mention they have the open late sign but constantly shut down early at night. Forget the late night ice cream run. Wawawahhhh!",1
"These cupcakes are extremely nasty. They taste like they are made from a box mix. I can buy 4 boxes of mix for the cost of 1 cupcake. Me thinks not. The cake is extremely dry and the icing is overly sweet, in my opinion. There are other cupcake places in town that are miles better than this one is. nI wouldnt recommend this place to a person without a tongue.",1
So I loved Jacqueline before now I love her even more. She took our wedding photos and they turned out amazing! Her photos are truly beautiful. She has a remarkable talent and her fun personality is highly contagious. We are so blessed that she preserved our wedding day and reception for us to enjoy forever!,2
"I just don't get high drink prices. You want me to spend bank rolls on the naked girls shaking their naughty bits in my face? Well there will not be any slamming of my dollars for a job well done if I can't get drunk and all my money is going towards booze! Think of the strippers ok? They've got children, habits, bills to take care of. WILL NO ONE THINK OF THE STRIPPERS?!",1
"Saw all the commercials and thought I'd try it. HORRIBLE! I had the chicken taco which should be hard to mess up but boy did they. The taco was so greasy and the chicken was chewy. The ""toppings "" were not good and after eating it I felt sick. I have never returned to a Del Taco anywhere else and do not plan to. I had to give it a star so I can post but otherwise I would not give it anything.",1
"Cheap place to stay. Decent bad, clean bathrooms. Customer service was terrible. Rude front desk. No one able to take responsibility and help when my player card wouldn't work. Advertised as free Wi Fi, but terribly slow. Buffett in the hotel was cheap and good though. Overall decent place to put your head at night.",1
I came to watch a world cup game at the bar . I used to have lunch at Bjs like 4 times a week. I see before during football season audio is way louder. During world cup game i ask 3 times and i barely can hear . Angela is a manager and she never take care of the situation and to be honest that makes me to not come back at Bjs anymore. Service and food is great. Manager is poor,1
I've been going to the eyebrows r us on Eastern Flamingo for about 2 years now. Manisha is the best! She has so much patience has great eyebrow threading skills. I refuse to let anyone else touch my eyebrows! She is worth the wait on busy days. The staff is friendly always make you feel comfortable in the shop. I highly recommend this shop Manisha!,2
"This ""dog park "" is a joke. Steele Indian School Park is huge and all they can offer the dogs is a small GRAVEL hill? Dogs need GRASS.or at least dirt to run in! I really wish the city would move the fence so the off leash area would include some of the large grass field that is adjacent to it so I could actually take my dog to this park to play!",1
"I was excited to try this cute little place. The entrees took so long to arrive, and when they did it was a bit sad. My meat was so dry and the pasta my better half ordered was just hard to describe. There weren't many there when we were there, so I'm not quite sure what took so long. It just wasn't very appetizing. Bummed.",1
"Great place to take the mother. A smoked ham and farmhouse cheddar toasted ciabatta was enough to keep me content, accompanied by a oolong tea for good measure. Apparently Eteket are trying to make tea, and I quote, ""sexy again "". Sure, the teas are great but I'll have to stop here as having the words sexy and mother in one review is plain wrong. Its just not good Eteaket.",2
"This Subway is conveniently located just off the freeway by a shell station in an area that doesn't have many options. I got a salad, which tasted OK, but I wished I had stopped her from chopping it to death.the spinach was bruised and the whole thing mushy.it would have had better texture if it had been left alone. For 7.99 it was a very mediocre salad. Cookies were good.",1
Every mall in Arizona should be indoor because of the heat. Thank goodness this outlet is. There are plenty of stores including an Oakley Outlet and Last Call. Downside is that there is no Coach outlet but you can't have it all. It has a wide selection of shops from things like Marshalls all the way up to Gap. If you are killing time and you want to stay indoors go to this outlet.,2
"Was very leery of a fish taco place. but I am sold! I am trying to talk my other half into giving it a go.and I am betting he will be converted too! nWent with a friend who knows all the out of the way, non chain places to eat. Had the corn salsa yum! Liked the beer batter fish. Very crowded, not big on the ""ambience "".but it was soooo good!",2
"DDD Had another great meal at Bachi Burger. Eight of us went last Sunday night. Was not too busy and got seated within a few minutes. Started with both the Duck and Pork Belly buns divine and the homemade Japanese pickles, six varieties and always great. Our party had a variety of the burgers, and everyone enjoyed. If you really want a well constructed, delicious burger, this is the place! Enjoy!",2
"LOVED IT! New to the area and had no idea where to go. I hoped on yelp and checked out the reviews. Everyone seemed to have such good things to say, I decided to give it a try. I'm really picky w my eyebrows, so I'm always nervous when I have to try out a new place, but this place was really good! And I'll definitely be making this my regular spot!",2
I will admit the tacos are pretty good . The salsas are delicious . All in all great food. The price is a bit high since they are so good you can't eat just three. And the portions can sometimes be small as they do limit the amount of meat and toppings on them . But no matter what they are worth every penny! The staff is super friendly. Will definitely return for more!,2
This is a fine place to meet friends or just sit and watch the action. The service is horrible however. Only about 6 other people there when I was there and it took over 20 minutes to get a beer. The waitress never came back and I had to go to the bar for a refill. Customer service at this hotel needs an upgrade as much as the hotel itself.,1
"As a business person it's important to look good, and when you look good you feel good. Christine is a master at making you look and feel good. It's not that often you come across someone who actually takes the time to listen and understand what your desires are. I would recommend The Barber Shoppe without hesitation to anyone.",2
"Love, love, love this place! I always get a beef and cheddar croissant with extra sweet peppers and I highly recommend it. The ordering process is a little overdone and confusing at times. The place always seems overstaffed yet it takes longer than expected to receive your food. Still the food is good so I keep going back.",2
"I only ate here because the guy kicked a field goal in at a UNLV football game. I had a guy behind on line, tell me that this was one of the best buffets in vegas. I hope not. It was mediocre at best, they sent the italian and asian foods through some kind of deflavorizing machine. Because what I ate was meh!",1
"Very poor tasting, very far from Authentic Viet food I found in my Pho Soup following vegetables carrots, brocoli, califlower etc. . Service is approximate, I ask for Nguo Nam aka fish sauce and they bought me some spring roll sauce.?!?! And they don't have teapot. Seriously, in an Asian restaurant ? Prices seems alright and they offer BYOB but not recommanded by or for Asian people.",1
"These guys totally rock. I had some problems with my plumbing that prevented installation of a new ice maker. I called at 6pm yesterday and very courteously got an appointment for 6am today. The technician Kris was right on time, very friendly, and had me to work on time by 8am. I will definitely be using them for all my plumbing issues knock on wood. .",2
"This is the place to be to eat a lot of food for breakfast. They do not skimp on portions. Pancakes are larger than your face. Tasty too! Their plates are all covered in hollandaise sauce and layers with potatoes, eggs, cheese, chicken . Amazing food, good price. I need to go again and try some other stuff.",2
Great experience of indoor carting with a bit of technology to boot. Really impressed with the timed racing and a fairly comprehensive printout for each racer at the end of each race to see how you compare to each other as well as those who have raced that particular week. Really an awesome experience and highly recommend if have transportation to get to this place!,2
"I was never really a NY style pizza fan, until we tried this place. My husband works nearby and decided to pick up a pizza on the way home one night needless to say, we haven't ordered crappy chain delivery pizza since! The pies are huge and loaded with toppings. Delicious! Their garlic knots aren't bad either.",2
"Their honey hot wings are the best! Oh my goodness, my mouth waters just thinking about these delicious wings! And dipped in ranch.yum! They always take so freaking long thats why I'm giving it four stars. Expects a 6 wings with french fries order to take between 45min to an hour. Other than that, the taste is delicious.",2
"I'm really not a fan of El Dorado. I don't like the service, the ambience, or the food! I feel that the only reason this place stays open is because L'avenue across the street always has a line up. I recently waited for 65 minutes for 2 eggs and sausage. WOW. I counted 9 front of house employees and they still can't get their s it together.",1
"Came here for lunch today with my mom. We were sat right away, and our server came to the table almost immediately. The food was tasty, and pretty big portions even mom's plate which was off the lunch menu was huge . Fast friendly service! In past visits, service wasn't always stellar could've even considered it as bad . But today we had a good experience. I'm happy we gave them another shot!",2
"I was hoping for a spectacular neighborhood diner but it's rather ordinary as far as food, menu, and atmosphere. I had a full breakfast and everything was just ok, service was just ok, and I don't think they've updated the furniture for decades. Must be the location that explains their success, and those retired folks sitting up at the counter.",1
"Grew up on Ramen, Udon Soba. So, saw the ad for this place really wanted to try. Ramen was very good the broth was very flavorful. Wish the Char chiu was more authentic to my JA taste. My roommate tried the Soba it was excellent. Will be back to try the udon or the soba. They need to have oshinko or tsukemeno as a side dish. Maybe I'll bring my owext time.LOL",2
Place is nice and clean. The coffee does taste great. This place is open 24 7. nDownside I have to agree with most of the reviews here. They put way too much ice into your coffee. Their sandwiches are a major disappointment as well. I rather go to Mr. Sandwich. 1 star for the coffee and 1 star for being new and clean.,1
"A Vegas style P.F. Chang's. Woopty fricken do. Looks nice from the outside but nothing special on the inside. When you sit down, all of the chairs are rickety.they rock back and forth when you move. Food was average. nOverpriced. nService was slow and they didn't seem to care about your requests. Don't even bother. The Wynn made a bad choice here.",1
I've been eating at Souper Salads since the first appeared in Phoenix 15 20 years ago. I like that they're more affordable the some competitors. It's pretty basic for seating and things but the salad bar is long and full of standard salad fixings. The salad here is usually fresh and I have no complaints at all. My kids would eat here 3x a week if I'd let them.,2
"Came here for my husband's 32nd birthday tonight. The server Emily was fantastic. So was the bartender. My husband said that his steak melted in his mouth. This is a great place hidden in an unassuming hotel. It's a nice break from the strip without being too far. A hidden gem, if you will. We'd definitely be back!",2
I found my new favorite place for Italian food! We tried this place out last week because we found them on Restaurant.com. Last week we had the best calzone since we moved here to AZ. Today great sausage parm sub lunch special. The restaurant is nothing fancy but it is clean and the food is delicious.that is what matters to me!,2
"While the food here was good, I am just not a fan of the long line, the packed atmosphere, and the tight quarters. Just don't feel like I had any personal space, and made me feel a bit stressed out, and rushed. I would suggest coming here for breakfast, however I highly recommend to avoid the busy hours.",1
"We were so looking forward to having a neighborhood Sushi place to go to. Service was good however the sushi was average and way over priced. We had two hand rolls, two sushi rolls and not alcohol. The rolls did not have an abundance amount of sushi but the price tag was 75.00 for our order. For this I would have gone to Ocean Club! Probably will not be going back.",1
"Got the tuna salad for dinner Sunday night. Asked for it to be cooked medium, came out well done. Was completely delicious, but I have been very VERY sick to my stomach since then two days now . Was heartbroken to throw away my leftovers, but didn't want to risk exacerbating my situation. Most likely going to avoid Cabo from now on, and I'm hoping that I feel better soon. ",1
"Good fried food, beer, and liquor, plus stripers next door, if I could bring my dog along this would be a mans paradise. I've honestly only run in to stuff my face and then be on with my day here. Chicken biscuit with a water, in and out in less than 15 mins. Will give it a proper review in the future, because I'm sure I'll be back.",2
"Definitely one of my favorite places to get lunch. It's easy, fresh and somewhat lighter and healthier compare to my other usual options. I've had the house special, the charbroiled pork and the Chinese sausage. They are all equally yummy to me. The bread is fresh and crispy. The veggies are fresh and crunchy. They also have boba tea.",2
"Decent atmosphere. Horrible service. I don't know how difficult it is to give a customer a lemon with their water after they've asked for it three times. Then when you go to the bar to get your own lemon you are grilled as to why you need only one lemon. I'm a customer and would like just a lemon and after I explain why, you seriously just need to stop with the questioning and give me a lemon.",1
"Atmosphere is fantastic, outside terrase, college crowd, great looking baristas and wood decor. The latte quality has gone down some because they introduced larger mugs and did not adjust the espresso concentrations to match results in a very weak latte. I recommend you order lattes in takeout cups instead or ask for the smaller latte version that has less milk.",2
"Had high hopes for this place after reading the reviews on Yelp. Walked in on a Friday morning at 8am.one person in front of me getting helped. Only one person at the counter and she was sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooowww as molasses.really was craving a donut but the setup was not that attractive and or appealing, donut case was dark and interior was kinda shabby. Sorry, I will go to PinkBox.",1
"You really have to make an effort to find worse pizza. Mediocre meats and veggies are placed under the cheese, making for a soggy, unappetizing pie. I don't eat fast food pizza often, but I have tried all the chains, and Papa John's is the worst of the bad. Do yourself a favor and find a locally owned restaurant that doesn't aspire to be the Wal Mart of pizzerias. You'll find plenty on Yelp.",1
"Stopped here after a concert. They were out of everything we wanted to try, we were left ordering hot dogs. The food was super greasy. Tried drying the fries with napkins due to them being soaked in oil. We had to just throw them away. The hush puppies were actually really good. I don't think we will be going back.",1
"Really wanted to like this place. Great atmosphere but the food was mediocre. I could have overlooked the food were it not for the less than friendly service. It was a Saturday night but this place wasn't even busy, yet our server acted like we were a huge pain in the ass for even coming in. Would maybe try this place again because of their great happy hour prices and my eternal optimism.",1
"Eh. would be great Mexican food in Oklahoma City or Ohio, not Phoenix. Would be like eating at Bucca de Beppo in little Italy. My 13.00 top shelf marg was so sweet I could barely drink it. Pork was good but tasted like bar b q not carnitas. For a chain go to Chipotle, for the real thing go to Barrio Cafe. Bright spot was tomatillo salsa, very good.",1
"Um, ya. Pure? No thanks. For being known as one of the hottest clubs in Vegas, the crowd was very 'eclectic'. But the worst part? The girl bartenders were all haters! Even after tipping them well our drinks were weaker than shit. So we stuck to the guys who made them allllll alcohol. 2 stars for no wait, no cover, and VIP access everywhere. But we were girls and Vegas is really kind to girls.",1
"It's been a while since my last visit, but they did have everything I needed. I was taking a color theory composition class which required specify taklon brushes and certain shades of acrylic paint. They had it all, even the paper I was looking for. Yep their pricey, but you get what you pay for, and they are a specialty store. Can't wait to revisit.",2
"Wow unbelievable ! Went with my mom my brother ordered a salad ,a plain burger a club sandwich . It was a Thursday at 2 50 was not busy at all only 3 tables were full . still waited 45minutes for our order . We had to leave because I was so hungry 35weeks pregnant told them we can't wait any longer still made us pay 8 bucks for 3 drinks . They were rude about the whole situation .",1
"Great for odd juices and European treats. Their salads are top notch and the baked goods are delish. It's just always so darn crowded in there and it's hard to get the attention of the sometimes flippant counter staff. Great people watching. I don't see how this place has been voted good for groups, unless they're ordering out?",2
No matter what time of day it is this drive thru line always seem to wrap around the entire building and it takes forever. I've been stuck in drive thru for 15mins now and just in time for this review to be done. nIf you choose to park then you will probably get stuck because of the drive thru line blocking you from trying to get out.,1
"Went here to see what the hype what about this place, I wasn't that great like I thought it would be. Their cupcakes were okay, just way too much frosting which made it too sweet. nHowever, they do have a variety of different flavors to choose from but they just need to lay off the frosting a tad bit.",1
Awesome show. My friend took my other friend and I there for our birthdays. Simply amazing. We had seats kind of close to the front. Although we missed the first 10 minutes or so I definitely would recommend this as a must see show in Vegas. I think I wanted to take of the performers home. All of the them were amazing.,2
I love this place and this gym. The owners are so nice and their employees are polite. I have been a member for 2 years and never had an issue. They now offer Zumba classes and the instructors are the BOMB! And you can lift weights after some awesome cardio! I do wish they would open at 5 30am. 6am is not early enough whe you work at 8am and have to shower and make a long drive I vegas traffic ,2
"Had lovely birthday dinner here for my wife. The setting was nice although the waiter did hand me a flashlight to read the menu. With booths around the perimeter and four tables in line down the center the size was intimate, but not isolated. Service was excellent and the food was very good and nicely presented. Rating is on the high end of four stars.",2
Original glazed fresh out of the oven is my fav! This location has friendly staff and area is relatively clean. I've been here 2 3 times and all those times they were making the fresh doughnuts. so either I'm lucky or they make a new batch every hour or so. Sometimes there are coupons that give buy one dozen get the second dozen free.,2
Me and my cousin checked out this place on a Thursday and it was pretty cool. They were having a Spearmint Rhino party there so there was some eye candy. There was no cover and we found a spot to chill pretty easily. The bartenders were hot and totally friendly. Cool enough for me and my cuz to drink 280 worth of alcohol in 2.5 hours. lol,2
"Yeah! Welcome to the neighborhood! Finally a Trader Joe's on this side of town. Nice new store with wide aisles. Love the cured meats, inexpensive cheeses. Yea there are a lot of frozen packaged foods for those that don't like to cook or in a hurry, that is great. Had lots of produce and was not crowded. They were out of a few products but it was later on Saturday.",2
"It is fancy restaurant! one of my friends from texas promised me to take most fancy restaurant in texas and i look it up online and i found out it is also in las vegas as well! So i went there for my anniversary with my boy friend. We ordered one bottle of wine, fried calamary, and two steak our meal was not pricey but i recommend to order special menu which is pricey but it would be more better ",2
"Oh boy. First they had to ask for direction for making a manhattan, which was on their menu. Then they didn't know what a shellfish allergy meant. When you sell sushi you should probably know the most common seafood allergy. The food was fine but not better than other places in the same price range.",1
"We ordered 2 dishes one came warm, the other came cold. The rice also came cold. We told the waitress and she took the food back, only to return with both luke warm. The manager stood on a chair to put candles on the wall, but never wiped it off. Everything was overpriced. Any other restaurant would be half the price. Nice people, but very unprofessional. No, I will not return.",1
"I wish I could give this place a higher rating. The food is worth something more, however, the service is terrible. I mean.absolutely terrible. As I write this, my server is out front flirting with girls from another table and eating pizza.after we asked him for our check. It took fifteen minutes to even get our drink orders.I just.don't come here unless you have an entire evening to blow.",1
"We return to watch sports, and eat burgers and wings. Our favorites are the black blue burger and the golden medium wings. Service can be hit or miss, but we come back for the wings and burgers. Cheap draft, awesome after 8pm daily specials, as well as happy hour. They have 2 pool tables and shuffleboard.",2
"I don't know how to describe it, but the food tastes clean here, and I think its a good thing. We ordered take out, I had the Chicken Lo Mein, the wife had the Seared Ahi Salad, and we shared an order of the fried shrimp and bacon. Everything tasted great, and it didn't leave me with the greasy regret feeling afterwards. At about 40 with tip, it beats cooking.",2
"This place gets no stars! Yelp forced me to put at least one The management sucks their pharmacy staff is the worst I've ever dealt with, their corporate never even answered me when I called and filed a complaint about the experience I had there. You're much better off going up the street to CVS, they are much nicer.",1
"I ordered the lobster stromboli and it was good, but that was not lobster in there. Tasted like the imitation crab stuff that is really a fish that tastes kind of like crab. I'm from Maine and grew up on lobster, and the meat inside was not lobster. I was dooped. I won't order that again. Very disappointed.",1
"I have been here about 3 times, twice for the weekend breakfast buffet and once for lunch. The food is similar to Denny's, so nothing special here. Everything here feels dingy and dirty, there was hair in one of the dishes in the buffet. Service is average, but employees are just as dirty looking as the restaurant.will not be coming here anymore.",1
I can see! After finding out I had Keratoconous and that Lasik eye surgery was not an option for my condition I settled for partial vision until Dr. Paez made it happen. He put me in a contact lens called Synergize that actually allowed me to see by pushing on my cornea. Very cool! I will forever be grateful.,2
"Not sure what's happened to this place but it has gone down hill. We use to drive across town to eat here. We went here for a business lunch and it wasn't that good, service was bad and the food was slopped onto the plates. Sad to see one of my old favs turn into just another crappy Mexican food place.",1
"Quick, high quality sandwiches and other quick offerings. The portions are generous and everything was high quality. Service was good, though it is just counter service then you can eat at the nearby sports bar, keno, or the small restaurant seating space . Tip.there's a discount coupon in the book you get on hotel check in. Oh, and the desserts were ridiculously large and very tasty.",2
"Just had Neil do the blinds for our rental home. The black out blinds were done first so he brought them out and hung them, then came out with the rest a week later they look AWESOME! Now I wish I hadn't done the others myself bought them at Home Depot 4 years ago. The kitchen and the master suite both look great, thanks to Neil. Thanks!",2
I've been screwed twice on sessions I bought from this place! I've trained at this gym off and on for a year and use to love the workouts but apparently the gym is under new ownership and now my sessions that I bought are no longer good. I can't blame that on the new owner but this is ridiculous and I won't be returning or recommending anybody to go here.,1
"Best customer service in town the owner introduced herself by name and gave me time to browse the menu and ask questions, without making me feel rushed. Cozy place with lots of natural light and a cute fireplace in the corner. The cat decor can be a little much if you're not a cat person like myself but that's easily made up for by the quality of the coffee and the pleasantness of the staff!",2
What can I say about Applebee's? It's an American chain restaurant. Food options are standard fare. Their Spinach Artichoke Dip is what had me coming here back in the day but now my palate has matured. REALLY nice servers tho. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae is the best thing I've had here albeit overpriced in comparison to similar desserts around town.,1
This Starbucks is amazing because the baristas are always hustling! They are personable and always willing to do what is right! They fill orders with a quickness too! Libby and Keven are always willing to chat with me during my nightly stop. Their smiles can make anyone happy! I was disappointed when I moved to first shift and knew I wouldn't see them anymore.,2
"I was part of the happy, fun group that went in last weekend and it was the buzzkill of the night. The doorstaff was rude, then completely ignored a maot part of our group shove me. It was close enough to the door to be seen by them. Another patron had to intervene and get the guy out of my face. Maybe they should pay a little attention to what is going on in the bar!",1
A lovely and authentic Japanese dining experience. Delicious food prepared by a master Chef. They are open for lunch and dinner. Reasonable pricing and a wonderfully extensive selection. You really can't go wrong with anything that you order. Throw some darts at the menu and enjoy a variety of foods.,2
"Don't do it! Way to expensive for the kind of food served. Fish taco's served with FRIED FISH! Yikes! My son had the ""live "" queso and chips. He thought this would be fun to see them made at the table. All the server did was dump the cheese, etc. in the bowl and stir! Not much of a show for 8.00! Bad nachos. However the chips and salsa at the table were good.",1
"An hour late, no call at all. Called vendor when appointment time passed, no response. Did not do business with them. The next day the sales person Grant emailed me repeatedly to tell me he didn't know what time the appointment was and to argue that expecting a call from them or for them to be on time was an unreasonable expectation.",1
"I'm supposedly supposed to be in the process of adopting a dog from them and now I haven't heard from them in 4 days and their website is disabled. SKETCHY! nI should've figured it out when I had to ask them 4 times to just call me, not email and they never did. Total scam. Glad I didn't give them any of my money!",1
"I've been to alot of buffets and this one was just ""OK "". They had a wide selection of food. anything you can think of they have. They had a good selection of desserts. Overall, the service was ok. the food was ok. Place was big, alot of seats and tables. Luckily it wasnt that busy when I was there.",1
"Welcome to IKEA, a GINORMOUS home goods warehouse store. This store is different than most home goods places, the closest comparison in store content is Bed Bath and Beyond but IKEA is on steroids. n Overall IKEA is a 2 star for me, I would give 5 stars for the content of items sold here but 1 star for the frustration of dealing with the crowds and less than helpful associates.",1
"This is another good bar to eat, drink, and play, especially for those working swing shift in the industry. The graveyard bartender, Keith, gave great service. The bar has a decent amount of beers on draft and the machines have low limits quarter blackjack . The bar food is typical for what you expect with good portions. go check it out!",2
"Yuck! It is overpriced. I ordered the sea bass and butterfish and soft shell crabs. The tempura was bad, and the fish way to oily and buttery. Luckily, we used a groupon but still for three of us we didn't eat much and the bill was way to high. For what you get not worth it. The best part of my meal was the hot tea. Not worth it.",1
"Vittoria is a very reliable Italian on George IV Bridge. We've visited oumerous occasions. Overall, we said ""we enjoyed Vittoria. It served us good dishes, in a lively environment, to a good standard. Next time you feel the need for Italian, particularly if you're in a medium sized group, head to Vittoria. They will serve your needs, very nicely. """,2
"Went there for lunch today and spent 11.96 for the buffet and a soda. The salad with the fresh vegetables was good and the clam chowder soup was ok. The pasta wasn't the greatest and I didn't care too much for the bread or pizza. Overall this place is too pricey, especially for lunch. Sometimes you need to re visit restaurants to remind yourself why you don't go there.",1
"To follow up on my earlier review the espresso shot seems to have been thoroughly over extracted. The beans were probably fine, the grind may have even been okay, but the shot could have been left entirely too long, well past blonde, and this over extracted. It's unfortunate, as there are lots of other places in the area to buy espresso pulled correctly.",1
"Hooray for Friends and Family night! Great grub, great company, great smells, great space! The pizza was terrific, the scotch was a delight and the onion rings and fries are wonderfully crispy and soft at the same time.hard to do. I had the roasted chicken after making a pig of myself on the testing tasting stuff! Go.just trust me this once!",2
"Paul hooked it up and the ""newb "" was beyond helpful! You can tell there's a great comradery amongst the employees the place is clean and the vibes are easy. My boyfriend and I got water while we waited and I got to hear all the annoying phone calls and they handled every call extremely well and you can tell they are always on the side of their customer. Amazing customer service!",2
"As for Irish pubs go, this place was fun, friendly, and had a good vibe. We took over the lower part of the bar and had a great time. The food was really good. A nice variety of traditional and nouveau cuisine. Big thumbs up. My hats off to the staff for making this place a good spot to watch the Canadiens Alouettes play.",2
"Arghhh screw this place. Chiara F was definitely right about the fact that people should NOT come here! I too waited more than two hours for a simple prescription. I asked them if they took healthnet and they called to make sure. They said that they took my healthcare provider and now I ended up with a bill for more than what the cost of the visit was. Ugh, livid with this place. Do NOT come here!",1
"We are so happy that tailgaters can choose Surprise az, n Love the food, love the pizzas, and wings, but sometimes we feel like we're invisible. The daytime service is not fast enough. We eat there several times a month. If the servers could pay just a little more attention to those who want to get their checks and leave that would be great. We will be back!",2
Went there for a Bachelor Party had a blast! A bit expensive for the short race about 2.00 per lap 55 for two races of 12 laps. but these things all a and your forearms will be pumped when done. They scott. I would recommend and visit again. Be ready to spend some of your drink or gambling money though.,2
"My husband and I came after the D backs came. It was expensive and had a limited menu. Food was ok, but how hard is it for a sports bar to have good wings. Our waitress was kind of rude, when we commented on the limited menu she told us that we were free to go to TGI Friday's. We will definitely remember to try that next time.",1
"While waiting for a delayed flight I ordered tomato soup with tortellini ONE tortellini . It was pitiful. So I ordered the pastrami sandwich which was so rancid I managed to choke down less than half before my body rejected it and I threw it up. Oh, also, when I got my bill it was 20 over. The bar dude was totally unrepentant. He corrected it without apology. DO. NOT. EAT. HERE.",1
I'm not sure why the ratings are so low for this place. Maybe because it's near all these fancy schmancy places in the MGM. Maybe it's that strip mall sounding name. But the food is actually really good. Just don't come for the sushi. It's more of a Chinese place and the rolls are very sloppy. Otherwise I totally recommend it!,2
Been to this location mainy times and so far everytime has been good. once they had a hard time keeping up with drinks but that was the only fault that i have found. food is great and portions are huge and we always walkout with leftovers. prices are moderate but you can always find coupons or online deals to help offset the prices. we will be back again!,2
"OK massage. Not very relaxing atmosphere. I could hear the music in the room next to me ans the toilet flushing three rooms away, also, the staff kept walking by the door chatting. Also, I hate being pressures into memberships. they give an OK massage if you don't mind all the noise or pressure to sign up.",1
"Service was HORRIBLE! Over 2 hours to get food delivered to table. Their excuse? They bring orders out ""family style "" as and whenever sushi dude gets things done. So, person with specific food choices has to twiddle thumbs while ""lucky "" odd person gets their order delivered. And adding insult to injury food when delivered is only mediocre at best Stay away",1
"Ran out of desserts! Pizza is awful, lasagna had chopped up left over ham in it gross! Our server left to go home halfway through the meal. Lastly they have massive TVs playing their food channel appearance where they cook things not on the menu. Don't believe the hype it's cheap and being your own wine the rest is subpar slop.",1
"In the summer this is the place to be, sun deck on the roof, clothing optional. Hot tub downstairs only seats four, water wasn't too hot but it was fun anyway. Wouldn't mind a better breakfast, cereal and bagels every morning, but the croissants were fresh every morning and they were mmm mmm good. Rooms were clean and the staff were very friendly.",2
"How many times have I've been a drunken here? More. then i've got fingers. nThe atmosphere is small, and social. nDrink. and be merry. nAlso for all those newbies who move here. This is a good place to see what locals do. Especially after work. oh and check out what they do on the nightly basis. I don't participate but it's all gravy. And did i mention i've been drunk! But no experience bad. ",2
"We only had breakfast here, but there was a beautiful selection of egg dishes and other lovely breakfast foods available at reasonable prices. The waitstaff were attentive and friendly, and the decor was very rugged minimalist chic. Almost a greek mediterranean vibe to the place. Wish I could have tried lunch or dinner!",2
"Enjoyed a great meal at The Grand Wok Sushi Bar while staying at the MGM Grand. Our server Annie was awesome! To enjoy a great vegan meal, we had the pad thai w o fish sauce and egg, avocado sushi rolls and per Annie's suggestion, a great spicy fried tofu dish. Excellent food and wonderful service. Would go back again for the exact same meal!",2
Although the staff was friendly and they were very quick. I would have rather waited a little while longer and had them actually clean the car. I had some spilled soda on the driver side door panel and in the cup holder. They didn't even bother to clean it. Now I think I should have not left a tip. No wonder they have on 3 full stars on here.,1
"Great experience, went in to get parts and advice on repairing and upgrading my mountain bike. They were helpful and informative and they didn't try to talk me into anything other than what I asked for. Prices extremely reasonable. I will go back there exclusively for all my bike needs. I wish I could get an auto shop I trusted as much. Thanks guys!",2
"this wuz 1 of my favorite buffets in vegas. never again! my boyfriend and i got there around 7pm. the wait in line wuz 2 hours long! ridiculous! everybody and their mothers wuz here. the food wuzn't all that it used 2 b. since it wuz 9pm, they close 10pm, most of the dessers were gone! that's the main reason i go there. maybe the sunday brunch is still good. who knows, and who cares now!",1
"While I really love the food here, I called in a to go order as I was on my way to work and when I got there the cook had been chatting with someone at a table and my order was not made. I was in a rush to get to work and found this unacceptable. They made my order quickly but I was very disappointed. Apparently socializing is more important to the cook than working.",1
Max's Alley is one of the few decent places in Concord. The atmosphere is pretty casual and the food is consistently good. The steak dishes have worked out the best for us and the artichoke dip is excellent. For more upscale casual restaurants we haven't found a better place closer than Huntersville or Charlotte.,2
"So I enjoy my Second Amendment tremendously. The facility is pretty amazing here. I am floored at how well developed the shooting areas are, the different areas for different size weapons, and the awesome set up of everything. It is a private club but the price for membership is exceptional. Yes it is outside but we all need to get a little more Vitamin D in us.",2
"I hate giving any place 1 star but I have to. Tried 2 gelatos mango and salted caramel. The salted caramel had no sea salt at all and was too gooey and overly sweet. The mango was sour and did not really taste like mango. Given the 9 we paid for these 2 individual separate scoops, and how bad they were, I simply cannot give this a ""eek! methinks not "" which is what Yelp classifies as 1 star.",1
"We ate here on our last day in Vegas. We'd passed the I heart Arepas sign every time we made our way up and down the strip. After we returned from our Hoover Dam tour we marched here from the old strip. It was delicious. We had the shrimp and chicken arepas, with a few drinks. What a great treat in the middle of the desert.",2
"The dim sum is just average at best. I am chinese so I know dim sum! It doesn't compare to a San Fran or NY or even my local Oriental East in the DC area. I wasn't expecting much from the other reviews, but thought I would give it a chance. The decor is lacking any luster very dated and needs renovation quick!",1
Had a groupon for BYOB painting. I was a little disappointed because I expected some instruction but they said paint whatever you want they had some examples that they would give some assistance with but you were free to use your creativity. I wanted my structure but my friends were great with this concept. I drank more wine than my friends and all left happy and would go back.,2
FYI if you smell something burning its your sandwich. A chicken deluxe and a captain cooler usually makes me happy EXCEPT when they burn the S out of it see pic . Captian you better check your girls they are messing up my sandwich experience! Maybe I just came at the wrong time? I would usually give four stars but due to this tragic sandwich I just unwrapped they can't be saved.,1
"Very cool lounge to relax and converse with friends, or also bring a date. They usually have a great music with a superb view from Mandalay Rooftop overlooking the North strip. I believe you might even be able to order food as well. If you have been to foundation it is pretty similar except the outside area is better and there is a restaurant next door as well.",2
"Bone in ribeye, mashed potatoes and vegetables perfectly cooked. nWine cant remember what kind due to drunkeness tasted good. nThe service and staff was excellent and knowledgeable. The walls of this place change about every 15ish minutes. Yes they change. Music starts playing and the wall either raises and lowers to look different. I cant do it justice you need to see it for yourself",2
So wanted to grab a bite before the Dbacks game and we dropped in here. Looked okay. We both had the pizza sandwich and we were both disappointed. It was not good. It wasn't gross but it wasn't good. nIt was our first time at Potbelly so we're not ready to write it off yet. We just hope the next time we take a chance they'll show us something good. nShould have gone to Subway tonight.,1
"Great atmosphere! My kids loved watching the planes take off and land, and the other patrons were all very friendly.felt like a small town cafe with a bunch of regulars who come in every day. The diner style food was good, and I would recommend the hash browns. The staff was also very friendly and worked with us to accommodate our kids' food allergies. We will definitely go back.",2
"We popped into Casa Don Juan for dinner last night. We got our usual carnitas for two and tamale, both were fantastic. The surprise tonight was the salsa and guacamole were also delicious. The salsa was nice and chunky with a little kick and the guac was so fresh and well seasoned. I hope they keep it up.",2
"Tea rrific teas has the best selection of teas I have ever came across. They having oolong teas, green teas, black teas and the tisanes. The tea is loose teas and you can purchase them by the ounce. It is very affordable and the quality is great. Tea arrific also offers services such as tea tastings, equipment, bags, etc.",2
"Very Enjoyable. This is the third time my wife and I have eaten here each time was worth the trip. nToday we enjoyed Water Boiled Fish Fish Fillet with Hot Chili Peppers , Kung Pao Chicken and Hot and Sour Soup. All were excellent. nService was prompt and the meal came out quickly, but no after service to refill water etc. was lacking.",2
"It's just classy enough without being intimidating, the food is excellent and won't break the bank, and it always seems to be a little bit happening no matter when I go there. I have a soft spot for plush burgundy coloured velour couches and yam fries. They specialise in some pretty unique martinis, and the brisket topped poutine is out of this world.",2
"Don't order the bean dip. It's not a dip at all, it's a bowl of beans. They provide Pita bread with it, but you are not able to spread the beans on the pita. It's really just the strangest appetizer I have ever ordered. Otherwise, I do love this place for socializing and listening to great music with friends.",1
"Good variance of Grecian fare. I love avgolemono a creamy, chicken lemon soup and theirs is the best I've had. I had a platter with gyro meat, grape leaves, mousakka and pasticia. All of them were delightful and served with warm pita and a generous dollop of tsatziki sauce. This was out first time at this place, and we'll be back.",2
"Went here with a coworker for their lunch special. I got Lo Mein, it was good, a bit oil but good. They have really redone the inside and many people were coming for takeout. The food was hot and fresh and the lunch specials were priced right! I really liked the tang dressing on the salad. I would come back!",2
"I really like the food and the atmosphere here. The Caprese salad was absolutely delicious and I'm a big fan of the chopped salads make sure you specify which chopped salad you want, though, got the wrong one on my last visit . My latest addiction is the artichoke pizza.oh so good! Terrific wine list, decent service. This restaurant is on my keeper list.",2
"Location, location, location. nA modestly priced steak dinner in one of the best location in Vegas. nWait until late afternoon when the sun sets behind the Bellagio. Request outside seating. You will be seated outside on The Strip, above the heads of people walking by, across from the Bellagio fountains. nIncredible. You'll have a wonderful experience.",2
I have never been there and I called to ask questions about birthday party package and get more information from them and their customer service was so horrible. they used awful words on phone with me. I have heard how wonderful and fun that place is and was sad that i had bad experience with them via phone.,1
"Terrible. Overpriced and the food is close to inedible. The ""eggs benedict "" were a runny mess smeared on my plate. Noodles were gross. All the food was flat and shapeless. It probably didn't help that I stood 30 mins in line for no apparent reason since there were plenty of empty tables in the place.",1
Had a fountain premier room and definitely worth it! Loved watching the fountains during the day and at night. The room was exceptionally clean and well decorated. My favorite hotel to stay in Vegas. The only negative that comes to mind is the checking in process. The lines were extremely long and very slow to check in.,2
"For early morning food one night after drinking in PBR Rock Bar I had a Hawaiian BBQ, which was absolutely delicious. Then for lunch on our final few hours in Vegas I had a Buffalo Chicken Wrap, which was packed with filling and was tasty too. I would have visited this shop more often had I been staying at Planet Hollywood. I thought the prices were good value too.",2
Loved this place! I've waned to come here since moving to Pittsburgh. The reviews really justify the experience. The beer selection is good not excellent have to head to Fathead's to get A beer selection but the food is really great. Have to get a wood fired pizza. Totally excellent. I also really recommend the candy bacon appetizer. Holy god. I'd go back here in a heart beat.,2
I have given this place chance by chance and I just can't like this place anymore. Happy Hour is decent and the house beers are good. What kills it for me is the Rib Eye steak. Everytime I order it its either under or over cooked to my liking. Doesn't taste that good. I come here for the Steak and nothing else. I don't think I will try this place to eat the steak again.,1
"The cuts of meat might be slightly better than Fogo especially the lamb but the down fall to this place are the caipirinhas. They make them here with fruit puree or concentrate instead of fresh fruit. Still a great meal and time, but if you are looking to place emphasis on the drink menu this is not the place, you will taste the difference.",2
"I am a big fan of the spa experience. I have been fortunate to enjoy a few different ones and the one at Aria, most recently. The facility and staff are great, I had a full body massage and facial and they were both excellent. They are busy busy on Sat if you prefer more quiet experience, I will recomend another day.",2
Seriously the best upscale Mexican American food I've ever had. I grew up in San Diego and I was interested to see how this would match up to authentic cuisine and it rocked my socks. The chef lived in Oaxaca for several years and what he brought back was pure bliss. Favorite dishes are the chilaquiles verdes and carne asada quesadilla. Oh and the place is stunning. Great job Sabor!,2
"One of the best convention centers in the world because of such events as the Consumer Electronics Show, SEMA and other big conventions enjoy coming here annually. All of the hotels and casinos coordinate very well with the Las Vegas Convention Visitors Authority to provide transportation, security and traffic pedestrian assistance.",2
"I've been to the NYC ones as well, and they all always have great sushi and a very upbeat, trendy atmosphere. The issue with this one in Vegas is that the service was extremely slow the waiter would forget about us for long periods of time and it was very loud and crowded. I had to shout the entire time just so the person I was with could here me.",2
"Warm welcome.clubby atmosphere suits occasion. Sad salad. Good drinks. Amateurish wine list ,Politely hostile waitress. Assurances of USDA prime 6 10 Smallish ? 20oz.? Porterhouse. Pathetic dull pink rewarmed Prime rib. nDessert very good.No relish tray.Try ClubA in NYC or BobR's backyard for charcoal grilles organic free range grass fed corn finished bone iHeaven . Avoid this place.",1
"Awesome Thai food. Really delicious. Attentive staff that gives you everything you need, doesn't hover, and stays out of the way. Good prices. If I had to say one negative thing, it would be that I expected hotness level 7 of 10 to be hotter, so next time I'll get an 8 or 9. There will definitely be a next time. So delicious.",2
Walked in with my 2 puppies and they took them on the spot. They did a great job after smelling like fermented urine from being boarded at the Vet. Their fur was super soft and they seemed to enjoy the place when we dropped them off. The owners let them free roam to get acquainted with the place before we left them. They even came home with cute festive bandanas!,2
"This is for the very rude security guard inside the club. Thanks for being the rudest, most un gentlemen like person I have ever had to encounter. Thanks for pulling and grabbing my wrist so hard, and yelling at me, a girl, because the place was so crowded that you thought I was pushing. F YOU, douche bag!",1
"I dunno what bean counter took over this place, but seriously, dude, stop counting the beans. And steak. And pork. The last three times I've been, I've had to remind the preparer that a quarter ounce of meat does not a taco make. You know who is down the block? Salsaritas. At the moment they own your ass. And my dollar",1
"This place is pretty small, yet very friendly. So far I'm not disappointed with the freshness of their food and the friendly service. I go there at least once a month for date night with my fiance. One time I went there and they gave us a free sushi roll. We usually get about 3 rolls with salad and soup and it's about 35. I'm going to keep going there for my sushi fix.",2
"Better food elsewhere. Nothing was a stand out. Tried the cheesecurds.just ok. Nothing special. The burger and the turkey sandwich were both just ok. Both were somewhat flavorless. The frites were also just ok. Service was fine and the atmosphere was good. But, I go for the food and nothing I tasted would draw me back anytime soon.",1
"Paid 14 for a burgerfi burger and it was not that great. The meat didn't really taste good and the fries tasted like they were burned. What a waste of money , it seems that the owners are purchasing the lowest quality meat. I honestly would've been more satisfied if I just went to the McDonald's across the street. Not worth wasting your money on an unsatisfying over priced meal.",1
"The food was over priced for what we received, and the service was poor to average. We know they were busy that night, but it's not an excuse for the service that night. My wife and I forgot our to go container, and when we returned 10 minutes later the server had already thrown it in the trash. Overall, a bad experience and we recommend avoiding this place.",1
"I had the pancakes with 2 eggs over easy and my wife had the lobster salad. Both were excellent and came out quickly and looking delicious. The patio is nice but the seating inside is comfortable. Even has a community table that gave the place a homey feeling. We can only give this place our highest compliment, ""We will be back. """,2
The worst service in all of Chandler.i have been here a dozen times and it never improves. Takes 10 minutes to get a menu and silverware. Another 10 minutes to place an order and then 30 minute to make an egg. I am a person who enjoys supporting non big chain local small business but not at the sacrafice of poor service. The village in is only 2 miles west of the hanger cafe on queen creek.,1
"Been eating here for years but after a long time waiting, it's time to review. Food may be good, but if you are in this area asking this kind of money, you should offer Wifi. Yes, they insist they have it under ""CafeWifi "" but it never connects. Until this is fixed they won't get anymore than a 1 star. No business meetings can be held, I can't do work while waiting for my food.",1
"They have done a spectacular job with the deck at the eastern location. The atmosphere rocks, food was great and the service gorgous and friendly. We ate the lamb chop appetizer highly recommend. Seafood and steaks oustanding. Kids were downstairs in the arcade while we enjoyed the nite under the stars The view of the city was worth every moment.",2
"I've been here before and had a somewhat better experience. This time not so much. As we watch everyone around us get there food, we waited for quite sometime before finally getting our food, only to find the chicken pieces are way to small. We repeatedly asked for drinks and the waiter only visited out table way too few times. I'm sorry I won't be coming back for a very long time.",1
"Had friends from out of town as exhibitors for a convention and I so agree with John T service is lousy and the food sucks! Granted, it was a food court in the convention center but we were told that the food is catered by Hilton. OMG! Skip the room service and pack your lunch dinner if you have to be there. Otherwise,. walk down the street to McDonald's at least you know what food you're getting!",1
"After reading the positive reviews I thought this would be a great place to check out. Sigh.the small dog park area is the size of your average backyard! Not sure why this would get good reviews? There is no room at all for dogs to run and play, then add the doggy parents and there is really no room! Major disappointment . And the parking is not that bad, as previous reviewers mentioned.",1
This place has a very nice patio. That being said their service is not that great. I may have seen my server twice the whole time I was there. There was a huge fan right behind my wife and I that was very loud making it hard to carry on a conversation. Their salsa is way too hot for me it is very fresh though . The food is okay at best. I probably won't go there again due to the service.,1
A beautiful hotel with accommodating staff and good amenities. The catering is splendid. The food is fresh and REALLY good! I don't need to say anymore than what has been said about the beds. Just the best there is. Bathrooms are modern and clean. Charlotte's beauty can be seen out my window. Stay here!,2
WARNING!.I gave this shop a chance and got screwed. Save your self the headache. Example.got a reasonable quote of 500 went to pick up bike and it was more without a phone call telling me.Drive belt was WAY too tight. Front break caliper was rebuilt and now the front break revisor is leaking .Didn't even bother to wipe work area after job was finished. Save your money,1
"FOR LUNCH ONLY! Came here the other day for lunch because I had heard about the lunch special. It was a little confusing at first because the specials are written on a dry erase board and are not on the menu. But for 10 you get miso soup, a side salad and a huge variety plate of sushi. This is an unreal deal. I'd literally come here EVERY day for lunch if I could.",2
I just moved to Arizona and am right across the street from this bar. The bartenders and patron have all been super nice the couple times I've been there. The food is great and the Bloody Mary bar on Saturday morning was the perfect fix for my hangover! I'm glad this place is a block away as I'll be frequenting here often after my first couple experiences dining and partying here!,2
"The pizza's pretty good, but OH MY GOSH THE GARLIC KNOTS! I would give those knots five stars if they were New York style bite sized! Like popcorn! but they are huge and I can only eat a few. They're amazing, though. They practically melt in your mouth. You just have to try one. One order, I mean. And don't share it.",2
"Enjoyed dinner here oew years eve 2011. We got there early so it wasn't too crowded. Ordered the fish fillet with black bean sauce, choi sum with garlic, half a duck, and pan fried noodles with seafood. That was a lot of food for two people but it was so good! Good food, great service. I highly recommend this mom and pop shop.",2
"I am a fan of this place, because it is near my house. I don't know why.but I still like Yogurtland. Maybe because they have this strong smell of Clorox every time I walk in? I don't want to smell that when I walk into a place that serves food. But, I I will return because it's close by and they do have red velvet ",2
Ordered their aged steak. Ordered it medium rare. Wow that was horrible. The steak was charred on the outside and didn't have any flavor to it. I also added on the lobster tail for 38 extra and that too was horrible. On the bright side their hamburger was pretty good. Well that is what my cousin told me. I will not be going back at all. Save your money and goto Flemmings or durants.,1
"The worst AYCE place I ever been to, this place is ""all you can WAIT "", first they forced us to order their hot food. Which we didn't. And then When we Ordered their sushi it took more than half an hour. Plus their service is awful. I will Never Ever go to this place again. Try it if u wanna waste your money.",1
"We went there with a couple locals and enjoyed the meal very much. I had the Beef Wellington something you don't see very often, and it was absolutely perfect. Even the spinach that it came with was good, and I hate cooked spinach. nService was excellent. nOnly issue is the price hefty, but by Las Vegas strip standards, it was a good deal.",2
"We have dined at BJ's several times and have always been pleased with the food. Our favorite is their Happy Hour 1 2 off pizzas in the bar area. The portion sizes are large and are great to share or take some home! It is kid friendly whcih is a bonus for us. We also really like the new smaller bites menu, it makes it easy to get several different dishes to share!",2
Stopped in for some quick appetizer and drinks. Got the nachos which are huge and served on a half cookie sheet and fried pickles which were delicious. Old fashion cocktail is fantastic but wasn't a fan on the Kramer. Service is great and the bartenders are very knowledgable. All in all a great experience and would love to come back to try more of the menu.,2
I am so happy to have found this little gem of a restaurant again. I visited here years ago with an ex and this place has the best Italian restaurant ever. I decided to Google it and see if it was still around. I'm gonna have to pay it a visit soon. Only complaint is that my portion of food was small.,2
"This place is as good as it gets. You get a beer when you walk in, a TV to watch when getting your hair cut, and nice people to chat with if you want to talk. You usually get in at the time of your appointment, and if you need a haircut immediately they can usually fit you in. I always get a nice hair cut.",2
"The restaurant is small and intimate. The service we had was excellent. Very attentive but not to the point where we felt they were interrupting us. The food was fresh, hot and very tasty.the Tapas selection is great and Curry dishes are delish. Great wine selection. The first time I've been to a Thai place. Very enjoyable time. Looking forward to a return visit",2
"Must say, I am going to be a bit cliche. But I am in the business and this place rocks. Jonah was our server and the food was great. Loud for atmosphere, but to me that means it's packed for a reason. Mac was good, steak was great, gnocchi was tasty. Pricy, not a place to take the kids for a quick bite but worth every penny.",2
"I've been to urban wax a few times now. I'm in love, the place is clean and crisp, the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable, and you can expect expert services. I just saw Nicole and all I can say is wow, what a treat! My brows and lip are perfect and the best job ever by far. Thanks urban wax and thank you Nicole!",2
"The roast beef was bland and boring. It took a long time. Didn't love the ambience. I always get a little annoyed when I see someone review a fancy restaurant that I love and criticize them for their 20 hamburger, so perhaps I should be a little kinder here given what might be appropriate expectations but honestly I expected something.more.",1
"I stopped by after work for froyo, the door is locked and they are closed. What's going on with the business? I really love this place hope they are remodeling and not closing down. This is one of the few best froyo places in central Vegas. I was really craving the peanut butter froyo with strawberries. Awe man! I hope you guys aren't bailing out on us! ",2
"It is such a wonderful feeling to walk in the door of your favorite coffee house and see such smiling faces like Becky, Mike and Hannah. They are always so helpful and so upbeat, a perfect way to start any day! I love all of the food items and especially the lattes, but I think you hit the jackpot when you find great food, drinks and customer service all under the same roof!",2
"More like NHO BANG!?!?! If you are used to the delicious goodness that is NY's Chinatown's Pho Bang, then do not jump up and down when you see a version in Montreal. How one can ruin good old fashion Cum Ga Nuong beats me, but this meal was awful. Everything is over fried and over cooked and just not good. Heartbreaking, really.",1
"After you get past the shock of seeing rifles selling alongside juicers, this store is a treasure trove for kitchen gadget junkies looking for reasonably priced quality goods. I splurged on Peugot apparently they make more than just cars salt and pepper grinders in a mustard colour that will be a great reminder of my trip to Montreal. The staff were friendly and very helpful.",2
"On the bigger weekends, this is the best party in America. Beautiful people that are easy to talk to, great DJ's, and an energy found nowhere else. Tip If you like to party really hard, get a lilypad close to the stage instead of a cabana. The cabanas are too far removed from the action. The lilypads put you right in the middle of it.",2
"If it was all possible to give GN no stars I would. The community fascination over this place is beyond me. The crust is me, too chewy and without taste. The sauce lacks good flavor, and while some of the toppings are different it is like putting lipstick on a pig. Maybe the community wants so much to support a local brand so they totally disregard the fact that the product is terrible.",1
"Took my 2001 BMW here after moving from San Diego in November I had them fix some things to get my car to pass smog. They did good work, so i decided to take it back there yesterday to get my belts replaced. I forgot to give them my remote for my car alarm and they sent someone to my house to pick it up. I live about 20 min away so it was very nice of them to do that for me.",2
"I love the food, but it is too pricey. I only come here once every year or two, since I can BBQ in my backyard for a fraction of this price. Aside from the price, this is a wonderful place to go! The waitress I had last time was extremely friendly. I wish I remembered her name, but she had the best customer service! ",2
"We definitely picked the right buffet. Awesome selection of food, most of which was top notch. Had great steak, salmon, mashed potatoes, and even eggs and bacon. Star of the show was the dessert. I sampled Cheesecake, Tiramisu, Carrot Cake, chocolate eclair and bread pudding. Wanted to try the pecan pie but was too full! Hooray Bellagio",2
"Oh you gotta be fucking kidding me. If you live in a dorm, topper's is like your idea of heaven. There's something about being that age that makes you want to order cheese covered bread that's so greasy that it soaks through the box and then dip it in ranch dressing. You know what that something is called? It's called weed.",1
"Whoooo child! I would've gained so much weight if I went to ASU. That Torpedo burger looked legit but my appetite was not up to the challenge. Burgers were juicy and cooked to order, topping bar had everything we needed to load our burgers. Jalepeno poppers were perfect popper size and onion rings were nice and crispy.",2
"First, just try finding a laundromat on Henderson.is there another one? Mostly clean overall, but the real issue is the absurd number of machines not working. I counted 14 dryers, and of those, 11 were out of service. There were post it notes all over the place stating out of order. I have never seen anything like it. I bet by next week nothing will be left available. How do operate this way?",1
"I was in the area and decided to come here for lunch. My waiter was friendly as he waited on me and kept returning frequently to refill my water glass. I ordered off the lunch menu and my food was delicious and not expensive. While I ate, I was in perfect view of a TV on SportsCenter which I liked. Too bad there were no subtitles.",2
"I LOVE this restaurant! The food is excellent and the servers are good. The restaurant is divided in to two parts the hibachi side and a table service side. I go to both sides and have had a good time on both sides. The one complaint that I have is that the cooks on the hibachi side, all use the same ""script "". They all do the same tricks and it gets old at times. Overall, it's a great place!",2
"This is one of my favorite bars in Henderson. I've been going here for 4 years now and never been disappointed. I usually see Karen, Allen, or Joe and they are all amazing. Friendly, funny, and great sense of humor. The fingers and fries and turkey burger are amazing. I have never been disappointed with this place. Definitely recommend it if you're looking for a relaxed night out for a few drinks",2
"This is second best to l'atelier in paris the paris location has the benefit of being located in paris, of course . Exquisite food, and a bargain compared to the restaurant next door. Wonderful food, excellent service I find the service is often very good in las vegas , and for someone who lives in LA, this place is a very good substitute for a quick trip to Paris.",2
"Garlic Knots were good. We tried based on prior yelp review. Prices were actually decent for Vegas, but it's Fremont St so all the food is cheaper down there. Waitress screwed up the order. She didn't write it down so I was not confident she'd get it right. We both got burgers. 1 4 lb which is what I prefer. The more toppings you put on it, the more it costs you.",2
"The red velvet pancakes do not make up for the more than half an hour wait for drinks that we had to order three times, the inattentive wait staff nor the cold breakfasts that were delivered to our table! People who were sat twenty minutes after us were served quicker and another patron had to direct the waitress to my table when she failed to stop at our table yet again.",1
"The service could be better. Much better. We waited about 10 minutes before we were asked for our drink, which was at the same time we ordered our food. The food was good. Not excellent, but definitely good. I don't think I would go back again just for the mere reason that there are other places to try. I wasn't extremely impressed.",1
"Food was cold even after sending back, beer was at 45 degrees. Asked about when it was going to be fixed, as it has been this way last 10 times I went, and was told that is all it gets. Rude waitress and no smiles at all. Greeter was excellent aswas the cleanliness of restaurant. All was spoiled with waitress, food, and beer!",1
I'm a frequent patron of T's. They have been a constant drain on my income since I was 18 and lived across the street. Friendly and knowledgeable staff that has been around for a few years. They know what I like whatever's cheap and usually tell me what their specials are as soon as I come in. There's also a good selection of beer for when I have a few extra dollars to spend on something fancy.,2
"Jimmy' is the BEST. They are extremely friendly and Jimmy takes great pride in giving you the perfect haircut. While his haircut is wonderful at any price, being a senior citizen the rate is 12. OUTSTANDING. nThe smell of talc and aftershave as well as the decor makes me feel like I've stepped back to my childhood.",2
I am very sorry to the owner of this restaurant to write this. nI am a korean. nAll I can say is this. They need to change the Chef. nand please do not believe all korean food tast like what they serve. nTry some others. Then you'll know what I am talking about. nThis place food is too expensive for the value.,1
"Did not get too far into the BS. Was on hold for more than 45 mins to make an appointment. Just want to remind you all that this is a ""For Profit "" organization. Treat them like you would any business that serves you. They do NOT have any special product or service that warrants such crappy service.",1
I have never had a bad experience here. Yes you will wait at the week end but the food is worth it. cash only should not be a problem they have an ATM inside. No cell phones makes a refreshing change it is all like going back in time including the decor. Servers are great. Food is fantastic love their ham and eggs and chocolate chip pancakes not had better anywhere else !,2
"Sushi Mon is my all time favorite sushi restaurant! Despite there's always a wait around dinner time, the sushi is fresh and they have the best tempura ice cream. I'd recommend to get the all you can eat to take advantage of all of the appetizers, sushi and dessert. Trust me, you have a lot to choose from!",2
"I love this place. Spicy noodles are good, red curry, fried rice basil and regular S S chicken, and lastly, pad Thai although a bit sweet the first time, it was very good the next. Lunch specials are a good value as well. As you can tell, I have been there enough times to be considered a fan. I hope you enjoy as much as I do!",2
"By far the best rendition of NY Style pizza in Charlotte. This was our first visit and we will definitely be back. Although we live closer to the Ballantyne we will go there next week. We just had a pizza with bacon and it was perfect. They use good cheese, an excellent sauce and perfectly crumbled bacon. Good atmosphere for kids too n",2
"Brownies galore! If you love chocolate you'll be in heaven. If you don't love chocolate, you'll learn to! nMy group had brownies 4.50 5 each, big Balsamico, Caramel Sal u00e9, Orange Amande. Also gianduja lime mousse, hazenut mousse, I think 5 6 each and a spicy hot chocolate nall was amazing, I couldn t even pick favourite!",2
"Not impressed. nWent there just before 12 noon. Nothing was ready for lunch. nNo pork today. Beef wasn't even on. nServer had an attitude of couldn't care less and the place stunk of alcohol. nThey wanted yelp reviews but we want good service, good value and to sample the goods. nI was really looking forward to this as they hyped up their profile and asked if yelpers could review. nDisappointed.",1
"The Place Older, Didn't seem that CleaThe Service Rude Slow. Even though they weren't busy. Food took awhile to come out. nThe Food The food was ok. Portions were not that great for Family Style Chinese Food. The menu stated a charge of 1.50 for a glass of water. Though I wasn't charged for it Wouldn't Go Again",1
"First in Arizona, then when I moved to the Charlotte area I was so happy to learn I could fall in Love all over and over again as frequently as I like in the South Park Mall. Staff is always friendly and helpful! Clothes, Fred Genuine , Books, Shoes, all kinds of cool Gifts, they play some cool music while you shop and a great place to fall in Love! Vavid ! ! ! Bring your BUS Now!",2
"We stumbled upon this place because we just didn't know where to eat when we arrived in Montreal. From the looks of it, it's your typical chain restaurant serving bar food and some pub like cuisines. Seems ok for a lunch spot as the locals poured in at noon on a friday. Prices are a little steep for mediocre food. Beer of the month was warm, but i think that's how everyone in Canada likes it?",1
"Ok I really feel torn to give it a bad review. The problem is.1 cookie is not 15 20 calories. nThey needed something to back this up. nNo vegan cookie is 15 20 calories. The desserts are really good, but I don't believe they are being honest about the calories. I am a skeptic, but this is a major deterrent for me.",1
"Worst place ever. Not only did they get my order wrong, they didn't put CHICKEN in our chicken sandwich! All it had was cheese and bacon between two buns! Our sodas were filled with ice that the straw would not fit and they were flat. The girl working the drive thru seemed nice, but I would have preferred to have gotten what I ordered.",1
Totally overpriced I spent 60 in the first 10 minutes I was there alone the drinks were so weak. I don't know how the bartender managed to make a weak shot as well but somehow he did. The place was totally pretentious and apparently only caters to bottle service as there was no place to sit unless you were VIP. I should have stayed at my hotel with the hicks!,1
"Just recently switch my daughter to this office. Dr.Jensen is great.,professional and very easy to communicate with. I was referred to him by her orthodontist. The office staff is great too, pleasant, patient and very helpful. It was a great decision to switch my daughter to Smile Reef. nI would higl recommend this office.",2
"One of the few, if not ONLY thing left from my ""once upon a time, Cynthia lived in So Cal.the land of Hollywood, Disneyland, beaches and great weather. "" Thank you I Out for having locations here out in the dirty, dry, desert. Your burgers and fries taste so much better than THAT other place. ahemfiveguysahem Don't worry, I would never go to the dark side.",2
I used to love to go here. The food used to be excellent every time you went. Now you never know what to expect and the prices are too high for the so so food. I will go back again someday but not real soon. For a family of 4 dinner after my son's graduation cost 65. Way to expensive for mediocre food.,1
"Cool place! I love the ambience. huge bar, lots of tables and booths, big leather chairs, chandeliers. It's a Gentleman's bar where ladies are welcome. I like it. I don't know much about Whiskey but this place makes me want to try their many different kinds. Oh, and I loooved the music that was playing. Next time I'll try the food and report back.",2
"Let's see.10 bucks for a tuna melt. Just a tuna melt.no pickle, no cole slaw, not even a decorative piece of lettuce. Just a slab of sandwich cut in two and tossed onto a white plate. The food wasn't bad, but I had a limited amount of meals to eat while in Montreal. Would I have wasted time in this diner if I could do it again? Nope.",1
We just stayed there for a get away weekend and had a great time. check in was very smooth. hotel sold out and no waiting on an elevator. food very good at buffet. room was nice and only down side needs firmer pillows. we had a walk in closet in our room. we could easily was to the baseball game. valet guys were great and very helpful. all three couples had a great time. will stay again.,2
"Really outstanding and correctly named. The menu has a great selection of Greek, Italian, Middle Eastern, and North African dishes. Normally a large menu makes me skeptical, but somehow these folks manage to never disappoint. nThe portions are quite large, so be aware of that as you attempt to choose just one or two items from their comprehensive and well executed menu.",2
"Lady J her Brown Skins are kicking butt! with a great Trio behind her she cannot lose. Just when you think the fabulous lead guitar with Hendrix and Kravitz inflections , then the base player starts playing rifts that rival. And Lady J, can give Jill Scott and Black Crowes new funkyness. I love this bar, only one like it in Phoenix. The Rythm Room can only dream.",2
"A sushi coma is what we were promised, and we left in a sushi induced coma indeed! I definitely recommend both the Mountain roll and All the Fish roll I think the names are correct . The seaweed and cucumber salads were both nice and fresh. Staff was super friendly. The place is tiny and pretty cramped, but we didn't mind at all. It feels so cozy. ",2
"We very much enjoyed our experience here. Our waiter was very friendly the food came out very quickly! Really busy at 10 pm on a Friday evening. 2 for 1 sake, wine beer! All you can eat includes desserts. Only thing I would say I didnt love was there was too much sauce on everything but you can always say no sauce!",2
"Easily one of the better Latin Mexican restaurants in the area. Menu selection is large with very good service, prices are affordable, and with the amount of food you get a bargain. Burrito was a little sloppy and oily, but palatable. Tacos seemed a little more healthier, but lacked the content of the best tacos not enough lettuce, meat ",2
"This is a true spa. Warmly greeted by Pablo and given a cup of tea while I filled out small questionnaire about my health. I had a hot stone massage and it put me in heaven. This is a must for anyone wanting a massage. Living Social and Groupon have great deals so use them. I plan to return for Pablo's great deals like ""buy 1 get 1 free "" and repeat customers specials.",2
"Pleasure to work with. Had no issues scheduling a same week appointment with Lawson staff. Austin, probably the friendliest plumber I've ever met, arrived on time to check out my leaky master tub faucet. He ended up not having a specific part that he needed to change out but his disassembling of the faucet head stopped the leak so problem was fixed! I now have Lawson bookmarked for the future.",2
Mediocre sushi but nothing to rave about. Deep fried rolls taste like the fryer oil hasn't been changed in weeks. Think state fair funnel cake batter clung to whatever roll you usually get. All you can eat sushi for 20 is a good concept but the execution is not great. Horrible service on an entirely new level. Doubt I'll be back anytime soon.,1
"Never have I been so ripped off at a smoothie store than at TCBY Fruithead Smoothies. Unfriendly service, wrong sized order at first, wasn't nearly enough yogurt, too much ice, way too expensive, forgot vitamin boost, horrible bland flavor. this is the worst airport food I've ever had. Go to a Wendy's and get a Apple Pecan Salad instead.",1
"The waitress was very friendly, but the food was definitely disappointing. The place was empty and no wonder, the calamari was old and not cooked properly, super rubbery. It's definitely one of those places that don't even try cause they can get away with just trapping tourists from a very busy street. Please avoid completely!",1
Just walked out of this place after being seated and ignored for 15 minutes in a mostly empty restaurant. 3 servers walked past us and even after alerting the empty headed hostess of our plight another 5 minutes passed. We gave up and have forever given up on this place. Can't wait for Sushi Brokers to open their new location. At least the service is nalways good there. Done with Stingray!,1
"I dig this place. I have yet to eat here, but friends who have said its good. I really like picking out my seats ahead of time and not fighting a crowd on busy weekends. The popcorn is pricey 8.50 for a big bowl with a refill. Come on Explanade, it's popped corn and it costs you 50 cents. You've already got our premium paid for the seat, throw us a bone!",2
"Not the best experience but wanted to try something new. The chicken burrito and salsa bar were ok but everything else was terrible, including the 3.08 they charged for greasy disgusting chips. It was also hard to communicate with the 2 employees they had on site as my Spanish is limited and there English almost seemed non exist ant.",1
"I used to go to First Watch once a week and I strongly recommend this place. The pancakes are to die for and the service is first rate. It i one of the few breakfast places that keeps it real with the sausage, and serves it up many ways links, patties, chorizo, etc . One of my favorite places in the valley.",2
"Amazing NY bagel shop in Las Vegas. It is always busy and there are always New Yorkers in there. The bagels are amazing, along with their varieties of cream cheese. Their lox, knish, and baked goods are incredible as well. If you have time, stay for the food. I recommend any of the eggs Benedict and the challah French toast. Huge portions and huge personality. Get some ruggulah to go.",2
LOVE! This place is awesome. It's great itialian at a decent price in a casual atmosphere. I've never had a bad meal but the Linguini in white clam sauce may very well be my favorite along side the lasagna. They have an excellent house salad as well. I've heard the pizza is good but we've never tried it. Yum. I love this place! I'm so glad we live so close ,2
"Worst service ever! Went here a few weeks ago about an hour and a halfway before they closed and got treated horribly ! I asked if we could get an appetizer and our writer replies with ""we'll what do you want? The kitchens closing soon "" we got up and left right then. Also had a hair in my water. Never coming here again !",1
"It's a good thing I don't live in Pittsburgh because I would eat here too often for it to be good for me. nIf you want a good, plain burger sandwich with lettuce and tomato, you can get it here. If you want a fantastic burger sandwich with anything and everything but the kitchen sink on it, you can also get it here. Definitely worth a stop in.",2
"Fail for the Travelzoo deal. Paid 99 for the voucher, which was to include full dinner for 2. What they failed to mention was the restaurant would make you pay tax 20 gratuity on the ""retail price "" of the offer 320 . So this 99 groupon esque deal actually ended up costing 200. Oh, and the food sucked.",1
"BLT has legit burgers! I love the tandoori lamb burger. The meat is really tender, and the flavor is rich. I've had a couple of their beef burgers as well, and they are delicious. Decent beer selection as well. Besides that, it's just a great place to hangout and enjoy great food. BLT has definitely become a staple for me whenever I'm in Vegas!",2
Really dissapointed after the great food in San Diego. They only have the big family style meals here but the lasagna was dry and not very tasty. The spaghetti with meatballs was boring and bland. Chicken parm was still good but hard to screw up that. The service was pretty ordinary too. Wont be back,1
I've eaten at Whiskey Rose many times since it has opened. It has slowly gone down hill. BBQ sauce once was excellent! Over time it changed to a store bought brand. Prices have gone up by a wide margin since it opened. Service is ok and food is ok. Zipps has better frys and better union rings and just as good burgers.,1
"This is a pretty crappy, small 7 Eleven. I was craving a Slurpee and was disappointed with their limited flavor choices. No hot dogs here either.so I settled on a donut to satisfy my junk food urge, and I think it holds the title of worse donut ever. I think I'll drive a bit further up the road next time.",1
"This was our first meal together when we moved here little bit over a year ago. Yes! We ordered pizza! I have always liked Pizza Hut, but this was a bad experience! Pizza was just plain, not much flavor? And we had to pay for it that evening to the next day! Wife refuses to order from there again. And I have no problem with that.",1
I love this little trail! It is a hard steep hike that is 2.2 miles round trip. Around the level of difficulty of camelback but easier for big dogs. Went this Sunday morning and only ran into about 10 people. Very nice. It might be a little difficult to find parking. Follow School house road up to hit the trail!,2
"As far as Pittsburgh bars are concerned, Hough's is a gem amongst semi precious stones. The draft and bottle selection is AWESOME. This is the perfect place to go if you're interested in trying something new. They even offer flights in addition to pints and growlers, so you can taste test your way through the draft list. Plus, there are plenty of tables. AND they have a shuffle board.",2
I was told by my roommates that when they opened in the summer this was the place to be so I had high expectations on my first visit. I was amazed at how big and savoury the burger was. I was so pleased that I didnt mind paying the pricey 15 dollars this time. After tried all the different types of patties and kinds of burgers I realized its pretty expensive.,2
I had two leaky sprinkler solenoids. I called Rich and he had Travis call me back within 10 minutes. Travis said he could be out in an hour. He was there in 40 minutes and had diagnosed the problem and gave me a very reasonable estimate. Work completed in 30 minutes. I would highly recommend these guys! Honest and efficient!,2
"We had some initial problems with Bugsy's. But, boy did they take care of us. They came over and fixed every minor detail. They also repaired shutters my dog chewed and put a new shutter in to make us happy. Thank you so much Bugsy's and Conrad. I am thrilled with my house now. I recommend Bugsy's to anyone. The shutters are beautiful!",2
I needed a new company for yard work. I went online and tried a couple of companies and I was surprised at the lack of response. Then I tried Ultimate Lawn Maintenance based on Yelp recommendations. Brian was great very responsive and did a great job for us on short notice HOA compliance . I will keep using Ultimate Lawn Maintenance and would gladly recommend them to anyone!,2
"Yummy! American food with the sweet and savory flavor combos reminiscent of Moroccan cuisine took me back to Fez and Marrakech! Loved the interesting and fresh take on sandwiches and salads. The atmosphere is hip, but not uncomfortably so at least not during the lunch hour. Try Either the FEZ burger or veggie burger both were delicious!",2
"first time that I visit the island burger restaurant, past it everyday on my way home for 9yrs living in Phoenix, should have kept going, order wings and it was salty and dry, husband order burger and it was tasteless not seasoned french fries was burn. 1 out 10 1 neverrrr going back. staff was nice, nothing against them. food sucks.",1
"I came in tonight hoping for a great experience but was not impressed with the service it was slow and I had to return my salmon dinner also we needed our beverages refreshed but unfortunately our waiter didn't have the chance to come around and when he did we had finished our meals and were ready to go. I don't think we will come back, ",1
Today I ordered from them for the first time to carry out a large bbq chicken pizza. Wen I got home I noticed that it had onions. Wen I called them to ask to exchange it I was denied. So much for customer service. I May have lost 12 for the purchase but they lost a customer for ever. Thank you tim for providing a horrible experience. I can see why everyone else gives them a bad review.,1
This pizza is the best. It's three days later and I'm still thinking about it. If you have enough people and about 15 mins order a whole pizza freshly made. Oh wow! We got Half classic pepperoni and other half their special sausage and bell pepper with fancy cheese. Get some garlic knuckles tide you over while you wait if you're that hungry. Yum! Can't wait to eat another!,2
"This place is a hidden treasure away from ChinaTown. Food variety when it comes to having dim sum is delicious, customer service is great and price is relatively inexpensive. Also there is plenty of seating areas, plenty of parking and nearby shopping centers. Highly recommend this location to anyone who craves for some oriental dim sum food.",2
"Went in for a simple bouquet of mixed white flowers. I stood out front, unhelped for too long. When I collected the bouquet, I asked if it could be bound as a bouquet and she said ""no, we just wrap it in plastic "". The people behind us, in line. Said this shop has some of the worst service in town. The gal brought the flowers back out, haphazardly wrapped without any moisture wrap on the stems.",1
Second time trying take out . Have thrown both away. First ordered extra spicy. Tasted like they just poured hot sauce over the food. This time I ordered the Chicken Lo Mein. It smelled burnt when I opened it. Yep! Nasty burnt taste! Even had some burnt noodles! Noodles are soggy.pastie. Last visit for me!,1
"Stopped in the other day for happy hour and I was very impressed. They have a huge selection of local beers on tap, all of which are 2 off during happy hour. And while the appetizer list is small only 5 or 6 selections I think the quality is very good for the price. I highly suggest you try the mignionettes and the fondu.",2
"Our server jason was awesome we had a movie to get to and only had a half hour and he made it happen , wish the food was as good as the service , rice is bland and the beans are terrible need to give it some more flavor , fish tacos were ok , and my girlfriend had the enchilada and meatball soup was really good , but same complaint rice ans beans are terrible , overall wasnt too bad though .",1
"4 star food and service is always great so that pushes it to 5 stars for me. Love their garlic chicken wings, the mount charleston and all you can menu. I've taken different friends and family here and they all love it as well. Sorry to see the downtown location closed, it's definitely a favorite place of mine to eat!",2
"Best Indian buffet I've had in my life and I'm not exaggerating. The dishes that should be spicy were actually spicey. Very affordable and although the building looks a little rundown on the outside, it's nice and clean on the inside. The hostess was friendly, too. Only thing that could've been better was the naan. It wasn't crispy at all, but what do you expect unless it's made to order?",2
"Attended the Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers show on June 13, 2012. Absolutely loved the venue, intimate and cozy and very friendly and efficient staff. Parking was easy a lot right down the street at 1 hr til 11pm or street parking, usually enforced 'til 6pm . Plenty of dining options around the place, too. I'll certainly be back if a show catches my eye!",2
"I went there on a Saturday night with two friends and experienced a drunk football fan seating at our table and calling us ""a holes "" all night. The bouncer spotted him but was probably too busy doing nothing and didn't lift a finger. Otherwise we had a nice chat with a few other local customers, but this ""event "" kinda ruined our evening there.",1
"I went to this show tonight and it was funny! Some real hot european girls in it as well. the host of the show was great, made me laugh my ass off as well as this comedic ""silk act "". the show is basically Cirque Du Soleil style in a small tent in front of Ceasers Palace. also this guy and girl act on roller skates was real neat.",2
"If, due to peer pressure, you find yourself in Las Vegas despite not being much of a Las Vegas person it happens , the museum is for you. Where else can you find mounted bobcats, photos of mobsters, and vintage neon signs under one roof? We had to take the city bus from the Strip and transfer 3 times who does that?! but it was worth it.",2
"Spend the weekend at this hotel, I couldn't be any happier. nThe room is very comfortable, but what make this hotel special is the service. A car with a driver ready to take you anywhere you want in downtown for free' call back when you're done and he'll pick you up. The food is delicious and the staff is very accommodating.",2
"Had chilaquiles verdes chicken sunnyside up eggs , shrimp ceviche, and chips n salsa n pico de gallo. All yum! 3 others had their plate of cheeseburger, 1 2 pollo asodo, and fish taco some salmon plate can't recall the name. All were very satisfied, I highly recommend if u like yummy food, good atmosphere, very helpful friendly and knowledgeable staff!",2
"Loved it! My husband and I had an amazing dinner here and will definitely be back again. The staff was friendly and organized and the food was fantastic. It's right next to the Venetian sportsbook so if you get the right seat, you have an added bonus. We ordered the XO Shrimp Lai Fen and Shrimp Soft Noodles and they were both to die for. Yum!",2
"I went to this place with my wife a few days ago. She was amazed with the ambiance, atmosphere, music, design, and of course food. We kind of happened to stop by, since we were in the mall anyways, and I am glad we did. Customer service is great, but you can tell they are in the process of establishing themselves. Long story short try it out. I would definitely recommend this place.",2
"This Giant Eagle gets TWO stars because their customer service stinks. Went to get some food, they have the club card perks card like at Safeway except that you can't get it! After waiting for 15 minutes and filling out the forms, I was told they were out of cards. And you can't get the card at a check out, you have to go to front desk. Blah!",1
"I think this place gets by on reputation as once being an awesome pizza place. I don't think the 2 hour wait was worth it. The pizza was good but to be honest, I've made an awesome pizza with my grill and a few wood chips. I'm glad I got to say I ate there but I won't be doing it again. For the price and the wait, this was more of a flop.",1
I always love star bucks but honestly Internet at all star bucks are horrible it's so slow and it sucks coz one of the reason I hangout in the store is to enjoy my iPad and drink my good coffee since Internet is slow then i cant to that. I wish they would update their Internet specifically this store 3,1
"The food is bland and tasteless. Maybe I'm spoiled by good filipino food. The tocino is flavorless, how can this happen? The karekare had no flavor as wells as the adobo. Really? How can you botch those up? At least the food was warm and fresh. But I would eat anything cold with more flavor. The food here isn't made with care. This is a big let down.",1
"First time at this place. Food was great. I'd definitely recommend getting the ceviche and the chicken sopes. The fish tacos we're also delicious. However unfortunately, the margaritas we're not good and I was looking forward to them. Overall, good food, poor drinks but great service. Ronnie, our server, was on point!",2
"I don't come in here often because the products are sub par and the selection is limited. We like to come here after a holiday to pick up holiday items on the cheap. The best time is after Valentine's Day and after Halloween.you can find some stuff for future Halloween Parties, ie plates, napkins, decorations for 75 off. Will I return? Only on those occasions above.",1
"Come hungry and leave ready to me in a food coma! I let the server 'build my own burger' I'll eat just about anything so it makes eating fun and they know what's good on the menu. Mushroom, slaw and guac burger was delish! Sweet potato fires were great for sharing and make room for the PB J shake! Good thing I didn't make any healthy news years resolutions cant wait to go back!",2
"Disappointing food was very horrible ! Rice hard n dry , beans tasted rotten, red sauce was sweet ! Taco not crispy saggy over all food was disgusting in general ! Then "" Anita "" became mad when I told her the food wasn't good . will never ever ever return to this wanna be Mexican restaurant again !",1
I've booked colors and cuts with Rina several times and she does an excellent job. She understands modern coloring and cutting techniques and always makes sure we're on the same page before starting a process. n Karina has left Regis along with many other talented stylists so I'm revising my rating.,1
"This place is theeee worst restaurant in the whole city! Could care less of its franchise all around the world. the fried chicken was horrible! The cheese burger had green meat inside of it so i didnt even attempt a bite of it! this place needs to be closed by the health dept, I just threw my food as well as my money away! sTAY away even if your ASIAN",1
HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE! nmy husband and i waited for about 45 minutes the place was HALF EMPTY! and the waiter paid most of his attention to the women seated at other tables. the frozen hot chocolate was 1 2 whip cream! i've been to the original one in NYC and thought i would expect the desserts AND service to be as good.i would give this place a 1 2 star if i could!,1
"Chicago style deepdish was great. I don't know how true to the original their pizza is as I have never been to Chicago, but I thought it tasted fantastic. What an unlikely place to find it too. The beer was quite nice. I have had quite a few IPAs and consider myself somewhat of an aficionado and theirs definitely stood out. Deff",2
WORST SUSHI EVER! Just ate lunch here today and I could not finish my food. I am pretty sure the fish had gone bad. Really disappointed because I was looking forward to sushi today. Service was mediocre and there was only one other person in the restaurant. that should have been a sign on a Saturday Would not eat here again.now off to let my tummy heal ,1
"I just got my couch, and oversize chair delivered and I couldn't be happier! the sales guy Chris helped me with the design and fabric choice and they came out more perfect than I expected especially for the cost nI got better quality and style for under 500 than my last set I bought for twice as much 8 years ago. nI'll def be a repeat customer!",2
"The Wynn is beautiful! The rooms are clean, nicely decorated and feature HUGE bathrooms. The pools are sparkling clean and lovely, with good service. Free water and fruits are passed around and you can order off their poolside menus. We upgraded to the Wynn Tower, which got us access to a second level of pools that weren't quite as crowded. I'd love to stay at the Wynn again!",2
"I couldnt tell you if the fish was fresh or not because its covered in sauce. When you try omakase where they pick what they make for you they give you four things at once so if you dont like something, you try one of the other things and forget about not liking the first thing that you tried. sushi for the masses",1
"Popped in here looking to try something new, was pleasantly surprised by not only the amazing food Hot Sour Soup Chicken Pad Thai , but by the fantastic ambience, extremely reasonable prices, and outstanding service. Sally, the server who helped us, was extremely outgoing and helpful. Will definitely be coming back!",2
"I don't feel FULLY at liberty to make a full Yelp worthy review for Mint as I was highly intoxicated on Saturday night, but I will do my best. We met ppl here who did have bottle service, so no lines to wait plus for me and my braced up knee! . Music was cool and had good systems. Pretentious? Absolutely. Great for ppl watching? Most def. Service there was great, IMO. Just not my crowd, is all. ",2
"I called the owner Monday to discuss what occurred Saturday evening. He was completely apologetic and professional. He asked us to give him a second chance, and make it right. Bravo ! nI failed to mention in my first review that my husband and I had eaten at this establishment a couple times previously, and really enjoyed the food. I'm going to chalk this up to just a fluke.",2
"You don't have to drop a fortune to see REAL talent. nThis is the REAL thing ! nGreat magic, laughs, an absolutely GORGEOUS assistant ! nAnd if that's not enough, after the show you can meet them all and have your picture taken with them. nA family friendly show in an intimate setting. nYou won't be disappointed !",2
"If I could give this show a rating of zero I would. As I write this review the performance that I attended is still being held. I received a ticket to this show as a comp. Although I didn't pay any money for this show, I felt as if I was owed a refund. After 40 minutes I just got up and walked out because it was just horrible. I have seen better performances by street performers on the strip.",1
"Seriously a bunch of jerks! Bought a table for 800 and they sat us outside on a tiny picnic table. Then after we were seated they proceeded to take a chair away from one of already seated and give us a foot stool to sit on. What a classless, trashy, bitchy club. Never, ever waste your time or money on the snotty hostess and lame managers.",1
"This is hands down the best sushi in las vegas! I've gone here a dozen times and they never let me down. Presentation, taste, atmosphere, and staff is all on point. My fav is the q roll, but so many more rolls are phenomenal. I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants and although I try to find other restaurants that compare and nothing ever comes close! Hokaido! You rock ",2
I loved this place! Everything we ordered tasted amazing. I ordered the Double Helix BBQ and it was heaven. The service was great except that the fries came out a few minutes after the burgers but no big deal. They had a DJ playing music on the outside patio which was really nice. I would recommend this place hands down.,2
The only thing good about their pizza slices is the price. The pizza includes way too much cheese for my tastes and is consequently far too greasy. Half the cheese would be a good starting point for me. The underlying crust supporting the toppings is usually anything but crusty. Next time I'll see if they can put the slice back in the pizza oven like some places do.,1
The food is pretty good especially if you like perogies but good luck getting it. I've been here a few times to see acoustic performances and every time I'm here the waitress spends more time smoking cigarettes at the bar than attending to her tables. 98 of the time I have to go to the bar to get another beer. But damn the perogies are good.,1
"If I could give it a negative star I would! Fried wontons stale awful, Kung Pao chicken was so dry it was not worth eating, sun devil pork was stringy filled with gristle! Awful! We didn't even eat any, told the waitress how awful it was she did nothing. Had coupon for free dinner b1g1 they refused to take it! Do yourself a favor don't go!",1
"I was in Venetian for a quick lunch with my coworker. We were first in line to sit at the bar. However, the old lady who took our order was so rude and unfriendly that we will never go there again. She has no idea of customer service and based on her, I can only assume the worst about staff training in Venetian. I'm very disappointed to say that I will never recommend this place to anyone.",1
"Beautiful, clean and smells nice not like chemicals. Hard to get into on a Saturday sign up for their monthly specials on their website. A little spendy for regular maintenance but fine for once in awhile, agree with the others staff seems unhappy and front desk leaves ALOT to be desired. Impossible for a drop in.",1
"I've been to Sushi Kim few times over the years and every time I've gone there the food and service hasn't lived to it's reputation of being one of the best Korean restaurant atleat in Pittsburgh. The food is okay. service is mediocre and staff . not the friendliest So, if anyone asks me to recommend a good korean or a sushi place. you can say this will definitely not make the list.",1
I actually can't even believe I'm leaving this place two starters I've gone to both Crown and Anchor bars and they have both been horrible horrible experiences yucky boring food not to mention slow slow service overall just a dump! It's kinda a place kids go to watch soccer and game on dirty machines.,1
AMAZING TACOS. Has to be one of my favorite tacos ever. Freshly made torillas they cook right in front of you. The Carne Asada fries were soooo good. Ate there twice it was that good and satisfacting. Love that they are open late and there lines were a little confusing but the tacos made up for that!,2
"We went to eat here for lunch during the pouring rain and it was a little hard to find but the food was great! We had the broccoli cheese soup, citrus jalapeno wings and a wedge salad with chicken. Everything was very tasty. The space is very large but due to the time of day and the rain there weren't many people there. I am ready to go back and try a dinner item or maybe the Sunday brunch.",2
"This was my very first spray tan.Lindsey was awesome! And patient with my silly ""first timer "" questions. The tan turned out GREAT. I used the lightest color and still looked tan. It is so natural looking with no streaking. I have since recommended Bronzed Bella to my friends and family. Lindsey will be giving me and my bridesmaids a tan before my wedding. Looking forward to it!",2
"I love the concept of this place so much, I'm rounding up to 4 stars. There are so many pinball machines here, it's mind boggling. Most of them are functional, and most cost .25 or .50 to play. Some of the games are from the 60s and 70s, and a few newer ones. I had one machine that ate my quarters, which was a bummer. But we enjoyed looking at them and playing on a few too.",2
I love this place. The staff is amazing EVERYONE IS FRIENDLY. From back of the house to the hostess! The staff all have a unique edgy look. The guy spins pizza dough out on the floor and plays with the crowed. The food is exceptional. It has an upbeat vibe with good ol fresh home cooked food. I am in LOVE!,2
"Flavorless. Kung Pao Chicken is suppose to be spicy right? Well not here. and where's the chicken. had more peanuts than chicken. Egg roll tasted as if it had been in freezer forever. Soda was flat,rice was dry. Would not be so bad, but i was one of maybe two other customers.Sad really.Gave two stars because my waitress was very nice.",1
"This place is the epitome of trash food. It was disgusting. We ended up throwing our food out because the burgers were so greasy and the cheese curds were still frozen in the middle. The custard had a weird, slimy consistency. The fries tasted like freezer burn. Wow, fast food has hit a new low with this place! Never again.",1
"For a ""Fast Food "" style place Freddy's really impressed me. The food was tasty, the service was friendly and fast, the only thing I can even think of nitpicking is the open tables were a bit dirty but there was an employee there to wipe it down before we could sit down. Into the regular rotation for sure.",2
"Aweful door man. I was looking for shuttle to convention center. This guy whom I ask for direction, he told me "" who told you that we have shuttle service in this hotel? "" nHe really want to find out even before he answer my question. I ask him again the same question and he was pissed off. But customer service not helpful stuck up door man!",1
I live down the street and I have been wanting to go to this bar. I am a huge diamondback fan and wanted to go inside to watch the game. It had the feel of a baker bar witch are regulars. Took a while to get any service. The bartender was ver rude. She gave us a dirty menu and never came back to take our order. We were watching the game then the tv went out. I would not go back.,1
"This place is gross. I would rather go to i out burgers behind the casino. Or better yet, they have a little food court w McDonalds really close to the entrance of the buffet. Just go there and get way better food for half the price. Everything is bland, everything is cheap. I also felt very dirty afterwards.",1
"One of my favorite places for happy hour. Drinks are good and sometimes they even have a free buffet It does get kind of busy sometimes, so make sure you get there early if you have a group bigger than 4. The lobby area is so cool and rustic like. The bathrooms are a trip to the early 1900s. Must stop in the winter decor is seasonable and their hot drinks are really really good.",2
"This is the most reasonably priced nail place. Not only is it priced well but they do a great job. Patrick was so friendly and easy to talk to. They have so many colors to choose from, gel and regular. Nevada nails treats their customers so well and they even have a punch card for their loyal customers. I will be making this place my regular nail salon and bringing my mom with me too.",2
"Definitely not worth a second trip. Dirty and bad service. The bread was great, but that was it. The salads looked wilted and were overdressed. The pasta was nothing to rave about actually a bit overcooked. And was served way to fast not even half way through our salads. So probably ended up under a heat lamp. Certainly would not recommend to anyone. 2 stars for the bread.",1
"Just went there 2 days ago for a Sunday breakfast. We parked our RV in the lot for a few nights and went down to the restaurant. Service was so bad. The waitresses act like you are an inconvenience, they don't know the menu, and the music is too loud for a Sunday morning. Prices are outrageous. This is the third time I've been there and every time, the service is slow and snotty.",1
"I never thought I would get a brazilian. My worst fear was the pain. Well, I am not going to lie, it is not painless, but it is tolerable. I try to take a couple of ibuprofen before I go. Emma and Rachel are wonderful. They make you feel at ease while you are spread eagle on the table. The wax they use is not as hot and I love how sanitary it is. No double dipping on the wax.",2
"Best Thai food in town. I absolutely love the curry, and my friend swears by the pork fried rice. There is a ton of excellent options on the menu, but be careful what you order on your first visit. I have a hard time ordering anything else. Now the only way I get to try anything new is to bring someone else and sample what they order. nService is always pleasant and decor is simple.",2
"This place is great. Though it could have also been the person I was with. Located in cute and quaint Heritage Square it provides good food, drinks and a relaxed vibe. I wish we had more places like this in Orange County and also more men like the guy I was with. Open late for those dates you don't want to end.",2
"Have tried twice to have breakfast here and both times the wait was prohibitive. Gave up both times and will not try again. What can one do to eggs to make people want to wait on long lines to eat? Don't know if this place deserves four or five stars, but not having eaten there, I can only give a one star rating because when you're hungry you should be able to eat.",1
"I don't remember what it was like before it was remodeled, but I feel as if they had a better selection and more items before the remodel. Every time I go there now, it just seems that everything is limited. I have to walk around the store like 10 times to find someone to help or answer my questions. Not impressed with them.",1
"The crepes here are good. They are tasty and they have a variety. However, the crepes are extremely over price. So over price that I cannot afford a drink. Finally, the staff is extremely rude and LOVES to make loud examples of people not familiar with their system. I've choseever to eat here again due to the staff.",1
"Death ray! When the sun is out and about, it feels like you're in a magnifying glass. nThis pool is small and there's no diving boards, lazy rivers, or slides. nThere is a bar there, and cabanas are available for a cost. If you're a guest here, lounge in the pool or get a tan. If you're an outsider, I suggest finding another pool.",1
"I really like all the renovations the theatre has made since making the transition to SMG. The seats throughout the theatre are amazingly comfortable and very spacious. I would forgo the food a stick to the drinks. They have specials almost everyday and make the drink to your liking. It's well worth the 10 to see a good movie, have a good drink, and a pleasant experience.",2
"Kristen is extremely creative and helpful. She also has so many pictures to get ideas from which is really important. I sent her a few pictures of what I was looking for and she did an amazing job, even better then what I sent her for my centerpieces. Flowers are so important and I would recommend Blume Events to anyone!",2
Chicken tortilla soup was room temp which is never good unless it's meant to be cold. Chile jalape u00f1o burger was greasy and warmish. Why is nothing served hot here?!? Left with a bad case of indigestion. I should've checked Yelp before eating here. Save your and eat somewhere else. Unless you want to see what a restaurant is like before it dies.,1
"BEST breakfast in Vegas and exceptional customer service. It's off the strip, but worth the drive. Everything cooked to perfection.a good old American breakfast, just the way restaurants use to serve. My father who is a retired chef gave it 5 stars as well. I plan to eat here again on my next trip to Vegas!",2
"This is the best place I know for california type Sushi. Reasoably priced as well. The Dinner All you can eat is around 27. For Sushi and other high quality japanese items I think that is very reasobale. The store has a kind of dark feeling to it and the waitress is ""asia friendly "" if you know what I mean. But hey the food is awesome! And that is what counts first and foremost.",2
"it's an interesting joint because it's a fusion of japanese, brazilian, and peruvian food. the food is really different and delicious. it is a bit pricy, but well worth it. where else will you be able to eat a meal with these many different elements. every bite is exciting and everything i ordered on the menu is great. the sashimi is great also.",2
"Well I am not from Thailand or China to tell you if its authentic or not ,but I can sure tell you the food is good and flavorful. nThe Veg fried rice took me back to Mumbai in a flash for its resemblance to the street food. A respite from the bland and overpriced food of The Strip 4 stars because I have been there just once",2
"There were some dishes on the menu that were good and some were ok the drinks were great however with vodka and pomegranate. Kimchi fried was good although there is a similar dish at ichiza that is priced less and taste about the same. I expected the quality to bet better than that of ichiza. The salmon i got had miso which tasted good, the only issue I have was the price.",2
"China Chili strikes again. We are not big Chinese food eaters but whenever we do have a craving, China Chili does not disappoint. We end up eating here about 4 times a year and are always happy. Tonight we had the orange chicken, house chow mein and ss pork. Nothing too adventurous but great taste and great price. We highly recommend it!",2
"I need to update my prior ""glowing "" 5 star review. I called recently to make the appointment Lynette and I had discussed in detail only to learn that Lynette is indefinitely out of the state and unavailable! Say what?! Lynette did not bother to let me know she was moving out of state. Now I'm removing 4 stars. Horrible way to treat loyal customers!",1
My first service was today. All the staff were incredibly friendly. They came up with a creative solution to my problem for 230 whereas the BMW dealer insisted it would be at least 650. They even fixed something they noticed while working and came 10 under their own estimate. Definitely the future place fit my car problems,2
"I didn't even get to try the actual yogurt yet, because they've been mysteriously closed every time I've gone. I work a bit later, but I thought going at 9 30 when it says they close at 11PM would suffice. Nope. I tried to go twice between 9 30 10 00 and they weren't open even though all websites say they're open.",1
"This place is wonderful! No complaints at all! Service is friendly and willing to help since it was my first time there. Ended up buying pastries for the go. Bought a pound of assorted rugulahs which included the Almond, Lemon Coconut, Chocolate Chip, Sugar Free Chocolate Chip, and the Apricot one. They were all AMAZING! Especially the Almond one. Will be coming back soon for sure!",2
The only good thing about this place was the price. The value is good.but you get what you pay for. The pizza was greasy and the sauce had no flavor. The wings had hardly any meat on them. My 5 year old only ate one piece and then said that his tummy hurt. He usually eats at least 4 pieces of pizza! We will not be returning.,1
"Out of all the bars, this one I call 'home'. Time and again they always book good bands for their weekend and most of our bike rallies either start or end here. Drinks are very fair and the staff friendly. This is not a place for you Wanna Be's, here you'll have to mind your Ps Qs and pay respect, so you better learn to rules or go home. This is a H.A. bar through and through.",2
I have been to this restaurant several times this is my first review of it. I don't go much for food that hurts and this place does a great job of making flavorful food that is not too spicey. We take our students to this restaurant each time we have a class and they always have great things to say about it. Good Job!,2
"Yup, just like the other reviewers, I got jipped. Bought their Living Social voucher, then suddenly received an email saying my voucher had been redeemed what? Called MbD, no answer. Emailed Living Social, they said to just call MbD. Duh. Called MbD again, and again, and again. No answer. Ended up getting a refund from Living Social.",1
The check in time is ridiculous! I've had to wait several times for over an hour to check io matter what time of the morning or night it is. All the kiosks are down. For the same price I won't come back I'll just go to Hooter's. They have absolutely no waiting times. This is simply unacceptable. I know your a classic Vegas hotel but get it together!,1
"How can you enjoy anything in this arena knowing US Airways brings so much frustration and misery to people around the country? This airline is the worst out there, consistently underserving customers, leaving people stranded, delivering the absolute lowest level of service. It's a shadow hanging over every Suns game.",1
"Ordered a bacon wrapped deep fried hot dog with their homemade relish.and potato salad.it came as potato salad SOUP and the hot dog was soooo salty that I could not eat it, the relish was tasteless and NEON green, the diet coke was good though.the reviews I read we're good which is why we stopped there, but all I have to say is the reviewers don't get out much",1
"I truly wish these kind of places didn't exist. They give a bad name to mexican food. For reference I just ordered the standard array of rice, beans, salsas, etc. As others have said, go to Chipotle or Qudoba if you want the american mexican style burritos. This place is simply not worth spending your time, money, daily allotment of calories, etc.",1
"would give ZERO stars if possible.horrible place. dr's are nice, but the staff is full of liars and tell you something is covered pre treatment and bill you something crazy post treatment. don't believe a word they say! unless you are a cash paying patient DO NOT go there if you are billing insurance. they will tell you 75 and bill you 390. STAY AWAY or BE WARNED!",1
I just moved here from FL and wanted to go get some real southern BBQ so heard good things about this place and I wasn't disappointed at all! Ribs and pulled pork were amazing colored greens delicious! They have free cheese biscuits that are out of this world staff was super friendly and prices were good! Cocktails were good too,2
"This place is not only the worst, as they always run out of food. They have their employees working over 100hrs without paying them and they only report up to 40 hrs to EDD so they wont pay overtime. The food is extremely over priced and the cashiers have no customer service skills! Think twice before stoping in to eat here!",1
The hotel is dirty and run down. The hotel was overbooked and could not accomodate our request for 2 beds despite having 3 people in the room and were io way apologetic. The front desk staff was unhelpful and very snotty. No fridge. Not even a coffee maker in the room. The casino seemed much smokier than all the others. Would not stay here again,1
"I just ate here with my sister. She recommended this Thai restaurant. The server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. We ordered shrimp rolls, chicken panang curry, and fried pork with Chinese broccoli. Everything was delicious and tasted very fresh. nThe price was reasonable as well. I shall return. Thanks sis for picking the restaurant. ",2
"The concierge of the Hilton almost insited that we go there. Since it was just around the corner and we were really up for a good steak we took his advice. nThe first impression was a high price steak house. nAfter a short time we got our table. Second impression high class, moderate prices, and exellent food quality. Also the waitresses were very observing. nWe came back the next day already!",2
"Had my front door rekeyed a year ago and the entire mechanism broke. The metal they use is really soft and wears down quickly. I called to see if there was any fee they could waive to come back out, and she said no. I asked if they have any warranty on quality of product and she said only 90 days. That's how long junk will last. Save your money and go somewhere else!",1
"Definitely not worth the wait, I'm not sure if anyone writing reviews has ever had a truly great taco before. There was nothing special about the meat, tortillas, or salsa. We tried the asada and pork, both were not even average. Go to any taco truck in LA and it will be faster and better than this joint! Highly disappointed and would never recommend.",1
"Eating food is an experience, and the staff at the bronze delivered. I ordered the compacted order, which is an amazing sandwich filled with great food. nBut the staff made it even better. This place had the best service of any restaurant that I have been to. nDefinitely try it when you come to Vegas.",2
"We went here on Sunday night, since we saw a big sign stated best vote and we were disappointed. They were busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table of two. My husband ordered pho and it was ok. I ordered com ga and springrolls and both werent that good. The services are friendly and fast. Overall, we didn't have a great experience and a little pricey.",1
"Our friend TSmith loves this place due to the cocunut smell they pump through the air vents. We stayed here for the second time at the top of this month and still enjoyed it. Very clean, beautiful hotel casino. The Hotel has suites that we stayed in over the summer but even the regular Mandalay rooms are great. On the pricey side for the strip but at least worth a stay once if you do Vegas.",2
"I like watches, I have too many and wifee will go bananas if I buy any more. So when one of my clasps broke I finally had an excuse to go to Tourneau. They stock everything and have a helpful service department, the salespeople hover around their individual areas like hawks so service is never far away. They are knowledgable and not too pushy. i like.",2
"Wow, this place amazed me. I called first to be sure they had my battery in stock and was told to stop in to get it replaced, no appointment needed. They just care about getting the work done and done right. Changed my battery in 15 minutes and I was back at work in 25. I am so glad I know where I can take my car and not waste my time or my money. Thanks, Eric!",2
"Food is awesome especially the way they cook it over an open fire. Everything is tender and melts in your mouth. I had sushi rolls, veggie's on kebab and blacked cod which was the best part. The presentation and sauces were phenomenal. This is the first place I actually had a good high end sake that I took my time drinking it was so good. I will definitely return many times.",2
"I hate going to mechanics! However, Bumper to Bumper was recommended to me by a friend and I've had only good experiences there. I took my car in for a basic repair that only cost me 25, but I expected to pay around 100 for it. I'm glad they were honest and didn't try to upsell me anything.they just fixed what was wrong and did it as inexpensively as possible. Highly recommended!",2
"If you're from Hawaii and visiting Vegas, you will definitely LOVE this place! Once I tried this place for the first time, I had to beg my boyfriend to keep coming back to eat. Definitely makes you feel at home. Their garlic chicken and fried saimin were delicious! The staff were also very friendly. Who knew you could eat such good local Hawaii food in another state?!",2
"The waffles here are pretty great. The savory options are especially noteworthy, with the Italian waffle blending basil, cheese and tomatoes quite aptly. That said, the chocolate and fruit combos tend to taste better during the Summer as the sourness of the berries does not seem sufficiently countenanced by the sweetness of the chocolate in winter.",2
Was here with my wife for lunch. Was seated and served very quickly. We both ordered the lunch special salad and wings. Salad was a joke. Lettuce with cheese and tomatoes. That's it. We had the chicken stripper which was deep fried chicken strips with sauce. Not very good. Waitress was good but I can't recommend this place.,1
If you are into seafood the buffet on Friday night might be ok. For us the food was overdone and not that good. The service was excellent. 95.00 and some change for four people. The fried chicken was so overlooked you couldn't eat it. They ran out of beef. Lettuce with browning edges. We would not go back even for the lunch buffet.,1
"Very disappointing. I was searching for a new salon moving to Clt and this was a recommendation. Not sure if the lady who typically does these was out, but the one who did wiped me the wrong way after she was done and well.ladies we know what a series of problems that causes. Would never go back after that experience!",1
"The ONLY thing that deserves the second star is the view. The food is crappy. That's it. Cheap food prepared poorly. I think I've experienced better flavor at Taco Bell. nThe cheese plate? What a joke, 4 crackers with some room temp Walmart cheese. nDrinks? Overpriced and over poured. nAmbiance? It's just weird.I felt like I was in a dungeon. It's safe to say that I will never be returning.",1
I had dinner here once when it first opened. I drive by here everyday because it's in my neighboorhood. I don't know what happened but it's a shame that they closed their doors already. This location is a great spot and the other restaurants there do a great business. It's sad to see a restaurant open and close so quickly. I hope the space won't remain empty for too long.,1
"The room I got was small, furniture seemed old and worn out. Security box was very small. The resort fee the hotel charges is about 32 per night which is a lot higher.It should be charged only if one needs to use the facilities like swimming pool, cardio room . nFor the price they charge its not worth. nThere were no discounts for shows,food for those who stay in the hotel.",1
"Stopped in to order a lunch to go. The service for take out was fine. nThe decor is the same as it was with Chengs. nThe soup was egg drop it was very pale and had no taste. nThe pepper steak was ok, not much on flavor. nThe egg roll was inedible. It was so oil soaked. nI do not think I will return.",1
A must try. Made to order custom donuts. Amazing! The donuts are warm and incredibly soft and the glazes are flavorful. When you enter you are greeted by friendly staff on how to create and order the donuts. This is a very family oriented establishment and has a fun and energetic environment. You'll have a great experience.,2
"what?!? i had reservations here for 10pm for my girlfriends birthday closes at 11 the host tells me they 'feel like' closing early, and they won't serve us. i ask to speak to the manager and he says he won't allow that. the patrons who were leaving when were denied said it was gross and super greasy anyway",1
"They NO LONGER have steak and eggs for 5.99! When I asked the host, she said they have it for 9.99 now. So we sat down ordered but the waitress said they have the top sirlion and eggs NOT with NY steak! Argh! We walked out! No need to ever come back this place ever again.unless promo comes back. I am so mad!",1
The food is delicious but overpriced for the take out portions. We ordered several pasta dishes and the lasagna portion was very small for the price. My wife got spaghetti and again very small. Get rid of the small tin dish and they've got it made. Manager did take our call and seemed to care. Even credited a little to our account phone number. Manager gets 5 stars.,1
I really like one of their managers who is here during the weekdays. He is very good at keeping the staff on their toes but I haven't seen him as recently as my last visit. The drive thru service is horrible with errors from ordering to inability to understanding the English language. This place has gone downhill.,1
"Attended a yelp event here tonight with my boyfriend.never been here before. The food was excellent and it was served buffet style. Had beef tacos, taquitos, tamales, chicken wings.followed by fried ice cream, sopapillas and flan. All of the food was wonderful, tasty and packed with flavor. Enjoyed all of this on the outside patio. nWill come back again.",2
"Overpriced, poor, poor communication, and last minute preparation during the wedding ceremony left us VERY disappointed with this highly rated florist. nConfusing estimate, which turned out to be higher at the last minute. In addition, the threats to not take anything or additional charges would be incurred was uncomfortable for the bride and groom.",1
"Want a good breakfast in a great environment. Check the del Piero out. The place has been greatly improved, it is now much more open and great to see several small business banning together to really make the place a destination. The food is great. Urge you check this restaurant out. Well worth your time and effort.",2
Get the steak frites! It was the best thing I ate along with the quiche lorraine and macaroni gratin which I thought was very bland. The steak frites was the perfect hearty meal for breakfast. Go early and get a table outside so you can watch the people walking down the strip being drunk or take the walk of shame!,2
"I LOVE Slickables! The cookies are always perfect, soft yet strong enough to withstand the ice cream. My favorites are the double chocolate chip, red velvet, white chocolate chip macadamia. The ice cream selection is great, offering something for everyone. 2 for a generous serving of ice cream sandwiched between 2 of their delicious cookies? Unbeatable. Best dessert in Tempe!",2
The place has a great patio which although most seats were open and we came on time for our noon reservation they claimed we had to have requested it. We had an important meeting and they still stuck us next to the kitchen! They did nothing to appease us. The food is OK. For the area there are way better places. I would never recommend due to horrible hosting and management.,1
Small local Pho restaurant. Better than others from a food and ambiance standpoint. Don't know if I'd drive across town for this place but I live nearby and I will most certainly be back. The sprig rolls there are much better than most other similar establishments I have been to. The sauces were also much more flavorful too. Our server was good too a young lady with tattoos and a bold personality.,2
"Always enjoyed their food here, we ordered chicken lettuce wrap, garlic shrimp with lobster sauce and Chilean sea bass everything is delicious! Our server Brandon was really nice and gave us free tiramisu because it's Christmas. It's a small portion but hey it's free! Love their tiramisu! Good ambience, right on the strip.",2
"Grease, grease, and more grease. I come here a lot because it's a 2 minute drive from my work. I always order the same thing, carne asada or lengua tacos, carne asada fries or nachos. Either or. I never, ever order over the phone. There's always a language barrier and they don't seem to get my order right. Other than, food comes out quick.",1
"I am the type of person that almost always orders 1 thing from each place I eat lunch, allowing me to mix up the location. I say this because the 'Cosa Nostra' sandwich is why I come here. I don't need to try anything else because I enjoy it that much, every time. It's also got a lot of cool unique Italian fares for take home, and the employees seem really nice.",2
"After getting kind of tired of the typical great pub food of Scotland, my family and I decided to come here. This vegetarian fare is AMAZING seriously. A bit pricey, of course, but totally beats pretty much all other vegetarian restaurant food I have had. The service was also great, and I had super good eggplant here.",2
"I've come here for lunch on and off for the past few months I've been working at my new job. This place isn't half bad, and its just like any other wendys I've been to. Lunch hour is busy in the resturant and the drive through, so come prepared and expect some delays when ordering. They also serve breakfast here, and I've never had a bad experience yet! In and out io time!",2
Don't let the one star fool you. Food is great but I've been to a few Cafe Rio's and they all have great food. They all are consistently good. This Cafe Rio in particular is horrible. They have horrible service. Every time I go I consistently order 50 60 of food. They have screwed up my order EVERYTIME.,1
It was super quick to get a marriage license here. Came in at 8 23 and left by 8 40. All it took was a little money and a few moments away from my drivers license now I'm inches away from being married. The workers didn't look to friendly but I suppose that's how they wanted to have the professional look? Come here for quick service for sure.,2
"I bought the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles book here in early 1985, when this location was Decarie and Queen Mary. Even before they had those 3 arcade machines. When that location closed down, I didn't know it was relocated. I did find this new location MANY years later and. and I'll always be a fan.",2
I have heard of this place and finally got there yesterday. WOW! I LOVE IT! It was in the nineties and needed a refresher. Had the rootbeer and pina colada with ice cream. My friend had the grape and watermelon with ice cream. The grape was pretty sweet BUT it did not get thrown away. HA! Want to go back SOON.,2
"You pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. Their line up is chock full of sandwiches, wraps, salads, soups, etc. They also have a ton of halfer options ie. half sandwich half soup, half salad half soup, etc. I'm a total sucker for halfies! Quicktip though, avoid hitting this place at lunch during the weekdays, it's an absolute madhouse.",2
"NOM NOM NOM. Very clean, everything tastes very fresh. The salsa bar is as good as everyone says. The fries were tasty too. I think their shrimp is slightly better than their fish. I normally hate corn tortillas, but was fine with these. Buy 2 get one free on Tuesdays! In the strip mall facing Walmart next to Panda Express.",2
"This was chinese food, which was a total surprise, since it is called a Thai Grill. I ordered kung pao chicken, which wasn't spicy at all and kind of bland. My wife had the lemon chicken which was pretty good, but not great. I was pretty disappointed that the only Thai food on the menu was pad thai. Oh well. It was worth a shot. nThe fellow who worked there was quite a character, and was fun.",1
"We had a Groupon for this. Still feel we overpaid. Rather boring, not scary. Though some of the props were way cool, the actors were terrible. Not to mention the whole thing lasts roughly 17 minutes. Meh, I wouldn't go back. Can't believe they actually have annual passes for this. Why? I think this place will close fairly soon.",1
"I don't know how this place has got its stars! nwe were six of us and only two were partially satisfied. nthe lady massaging me, was on the phone non stop. she got at least 10 calls before I started keeping count which was 8 call. so she got like 18 calls while massaging me. basically I got a ONE HAND foot massage!",1
"Very impressed with this place. Cheap 12 for a cut and neck shave , they got me in and out quickly and they were very friendly. The only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 was because they don't offer facial shaves. But kudos to Jennifer the person who cut my hair for offering a few recommendations when I inquired about a facial shave.",2
"Portions were very small. The food I got butter chicken wasn't bad, but a little too salty. But 7 for the tiniest portion ever. A restaurant can make up for price by adding value friendly service, great ambience , but Wok Box fails on those fronts as well. Next time I'm at that mall and hungry, I'll walk next door to Chipotle and get a better value for my 7.",1
I love this place when I am looking for something more than just a fast food burger. My personal favorite is the Blue Ribbon Burger its so tasty. It has just the right amount of bleu cheese an steak sauce topped off with crispy onion strings and don't forget to try the parmesan garlic fries with your burger.,2
"I've been going here since I was a kid. Love the petting zoo and the prairie dogs. If you go, hope that the badger is out because he is ADORABLE. And the whole thing is free! Can you believe it? Very clean, very nice zoo. An asset to Madison. The beach and park across the street are very nice and clean as well.",2
"The chile relleno the standard by which all Mexican food restaurants should judged due to the difficulty in preparation was soggy with a bland ranchero sauce and stuffed with cheese that quickly solidified into a chewy slug. Stick to the tasty mole sauce, which covered some dry chicken stuffed enchiladas.",1
"Went to Coconuts for the first time and we really enjoyed it. Had the fish and chips very good. Used to cod, but the mahi mahi was a great change. We will be back to try something new. Edgar at the register has a great personality and was very personable and helpful with the menu! All restaurants need personalities like his to go along with good food. Will go again for sure!",2
"What a joke! Service is way too long for 1 00am not pm and basically empty. Still it took more than 15 minutes to bring out breakfast food. I got up and left, disgusted! Overpriced. 8 for a breakfast bagel! You must be kidding. I will go to Starbucks instead and pay 1 '2 that for the same plus coffee.",1
"This place used to be great, but it fell terribly downhill. We first walked in and no one greeted us. Second our table was filthy which i understand if it busy. it wasnt. the menus were disgusting and had food in them. i wanted to wash my hands after looking at them. the waitress brought the wrong beer and the water cup was dirty needless to say we walked out and went to bj's",1
"I've eaten here a number of times since they opened, both in the restaurant and take out. Have never had a bad meal even fast food can be over or under cooked, just ask my son . Service is always good and they keep the dining area clean. Having the sauces in the large dispensers is one item I love since you don't have to deal with the little plastic bags and more often, take more than one needs.",2
"eeeh, it was a hot dog. Nothing special at all, not generous with any toppings I feel like I walked into the great depression. They only give you just enough dog, bun, onions, and mustard to cover their costs other than that, you don't get what you pay for. If there was something really special about this place or how they do business, or with their food, I would go here more often.",1
"Our service was fantastic our waitress was absolutely adorable but after hearing from the waitress that NOTHING is fresh its all pre processed frozen food, I was really disappointed. We had already ordered. The Pumpkin Curry is pretty good. But I have had much better Thai. If you want fresh, incredible Thai Naga is the only way to go in this state. Save yourself from a greasy belly ache ",1
"My review is for casino grounds and not rooms, as I have not stayed here. The tables are cheap and they have COMMISSION FREE, Progressive chance winning PAI GOW, 10 minimum. Although I haven't worn money from here, I can't complain on gambling though. After being extremely full from Oyster Bar, I can come relax and gamble at the tables then head back to whichever upscale hotel.",2
"Been to Vegas many times and begged to see the show and hubby was like lets see something else. finally March 2014 I said we are going! And guess who enjoyed the show the most. I am a product of the 70s and was a Donny Osmond , Osmond Brothers teenie bopper fan! It was amazing! And to my surprise Marie was unbelievable! Such talent!",2
Attended a seminar at this hotel recently and found it to be a great place for a corporate event. The hotel lobby is nice and ballrooms are well equipped for all sorts of meetings. The only possible problem is parking it seems that could be a bit of an issue if there is a lot going on at the time of your event.,2
"This place is eye candy.but that's where it stopped. Tried to dine here after a show and unfortunately the snarky hostess pi ed me off so much,we just moved along. Where do they get these juvenile acting brats when there are so many great people looking for employment? Time for a tude change and it won't be on my dime.",1
"Service was pretty bad, they take forever to bring stuff even the Togo boxes. The waiter is very rude. Out of the 6 dishes only 2 were edible, Chicken shawarma was an exception. They brought extra Salad dish when we actually asked for the salad that comes with a 2 fee. The waiter was pushing us, feels like he wanted us out. nI will not recommend anyone.",1
"Don't let the mini mall exterior fool you, Monsoon Siam is a real treat. Yellow curry with beef and potatoes inexpensive and phenomenal. Food presentation was fun and everyone ate in silence for half a plate. Looking forward to returning to try many other dishes. Service was super slow but it was worth the wait.",2
NEGATIVE STARS! I only put 1 star because yelp made me click on one before posting this nThe worst experience I have EVER had in Las Vegas! nThe place was FILTHY! Service or lack thereof was a huge issue. We were on the 30th floor was as noisy as if we were one the 1st foor. nNever EVER again! Very very disappointed!,1
Fun for little kids. cute and cheesy. But If you don't have kids or not going with people that have kids you may not want to stop in. we came in from out of town to visit friends whom have children. I believe the kids had a good time. Food was actually pretty good. Follow directions on how to hold the plate. its not a joke.,1
"Terrible customer service, I live 1.5 miles from this location. I tried calling the store several times, but I either got put on hold or no one picked up. I decided to walk over there, turns out their delivery radius is not based on mileage, but a 5 minute travel time. What deceptive advertising, no wonder you can be ""freaky fast "" when you only travel 5 minutes.",1
Wow! a hidden treasure. Great deal for a manicure pedicure and the work is better than the last time I visted a high end resort. Lana owns the shop and is very friendly and goes out of her way to provide great service. The shop is located in the same strip as the Venues cafe. You need to call first because Lana only works by appointment.,2
"le pain est croustillant ici , il me rappelle la France. En plus les prix sont moins u00e9lev u00e9s que dans certaines grandes chaines.Enfin du vrai pain. L' u00e9colier au chocolat u00e9tait vraiment bon, avec des vrais morceaux de chocolat mais mon pr u00e9f u00e9r u00e9 reste le bun pomme caramel ! nJe ne me lasse pas , leurs pains et viennoiseries sont d u00e9licieux !",2
The Light Factory is awesome. It puts on very cool photography exhibits and has a variety of educational programs for digital and film photography for teens and adults. One example The Light Factory did an amazing photo and art exhibit on post Katrina New Orleans after taking a group of high school photography students on a trip there.,2
"Well I ate here a few months ago, and it was passable, but today, not so! over forty minutes to get a beer a cup of soup and an order of sliders, and then it was a big puzzle to find anyone to help me get out! The only compensation for all the trouble was 'sorry about that' which is about as compassionate as a rock. Probably best if you are well buzzed, then you might not notice.",1
"The cadillac margarita is very disappointing, not enough alcohol. The pink tacos were decent but my tortillas broke apart as soon as i picked up the taco. The service was horrible, we asked to start with guacamole and chips and they ended up bringing it out with our meal. When we told them we didn't want it anymore the waitress shot us a dirty look, she also didn't check up on us at all",1
"I originally liked this company, I guess the first service was the honeymoon phase. Each time we called afterwards they were either very late, or did not show up at all! This last time was the last straw, will NEVER EVER use this company again. If you have a day to burn and can wait all day go for it. Otherwise there are plenty of other vendors out there.",1
"What a huge disappointment. We split a lobster roll and got 'The Connecticut' with fries combo. The fries were very good, for sure and the reason for what stars I did give them. The lobster however was the most over cooked lobster I have ever eaten. It was so rubbery that it was tough to pull apart. The staff was very friendly and helpful, very nice and respectful even. They get a star too!",1
"Bryant Pest Control is the Best. They are affordable, and truly take care of their customers. when they arrive at our home they are always professional and very courteous. We appreciate the Excellent customer service they supply and well as their flexibility when it comes to scheduling. nthank you for the continued excellent service.",2
"I've always had a great experience at this location, but I've heard so many rumors about problems when ordering chicken. Considering this is an Italian restaurant, it is recommended to get the pasta. nLOVE bottomless salad and garlic bread. Garlic bread sooo good. nI love the caeser salad here too! nPrice range is good, food is good, experience is good, I would recommend to pasta lovers.",2
i am a 23 latino man who has had tacos all his life. i can honestly say that these tacos are on of my top three all time best. there is always a giant line for a reason. you can see a sence of pride in the food these guys make. i dont like the fact that there is never any seats and that the lines are way too long but the tacos are so great that i must give this play a perfect rating.,2
"I am obsessed with this place. I've taken two classes so far and they have both kicked my butt SO hard! The instructors are great also, they make you feel really comfortable and don't make you feel judged if you can't finish a set. I've taken the reformer pilates with TRX and the booty and arms class. It's a little pricey but you definitely get what you pay for and I think it's worth every cent!",2
Have yet to recieve my security deposit that i was suppose to get over three weeks ago. Horrible customer service and there is so many fee's after the fact that they will not inform you of. Not only will i never use hertz again i will suggest to anyone who visits to get basically anyone but hertz horrible.,1
"I miss Rosita's. I've not lived in Arizona in a few years, so perhaps it's gone downhill. However, their chips and salsa were always fantastic. I could get full just from that. And their chimichangas were to die for. I always went during lunch, as it was just up the road from work. It was cheap, quick, good service, and tasty for the price.",2
"perhaps, the worst hotel i have ever stayed in while in vegas. service was crap and the whole wristband thing was annoying. took us forever to get to the room and there were no sheets for the sofa bed. i am sad that i got to experience elara and not PH westgate towers. but then again, i'm sure their service sucked just as much. def. will not book there ever again.",1
Great place to eat in the arrowhead area. What I like to do is go there before hitting Harkins Arrowhead Fountains and get the Tortilla Soup and Chicken Tacos. It's like around 9 and fills you up. Busy enough where you can tell that it's good but isn't overly packed. Most I've ever waited was 45 minutes and that was during spring training on a saturday night.,2
"When my daughter's car had problems, it was towed to another shop. They quoted us an outrageous price to fix it and were not friendly. Not comfortable with them, we had the car towed to Ron's Service and tire Center. What a differance! Ron's was friendly, professional and the cost to fix the car was a fraction of the other place. I recommend Ron's to everyone I meet.",2
"I've eaten at Tony Pizzeria at least 1 2 dozen times for lunch. Service was good where waitress paid close attention to making sure I was taken care of. I usually have the sub sandwiches meatball and chicken parm. Good taste, good size and reasonably priced. This is a hidden gem and I would recommend it to friends.",2
"I went to this Subway today excited that it was a drive thru. That part as great.easy ect. But good lord.the bread at this place is terrible. It's pretty much most Subway's I have been to as well. I keep thinking it will get better and keep trying it over and over, but wow. The bread is stale EVERY time. I guess I don't understand how they can serve this?",1
We went last night and tried many different appetizers pasta dishes. Italian Spring Rolls we would not order agaiBruschetta Nakamura we would not order agaiFried Jidori Chicken was ok nFried Oyster was ok nJidori Chicken Japanese Mushroom Salad Excellent Miso Carbonara was excellent nSpaghetti Uni Tomato Cream excellent nSquid Ink Spaghetti Ok but not outstanding nKinoko Meat Sauce Excellent,1
"Picasso's is cool, my girlfriend used to live in the area so we frequently visit Charlotte. Picasso's is a great place with lots of TV's, seating and games. The drinks are inexpensive and the food looked good. My only complaint is that they didn't have the UFC fight on there. Had to walk to Buffalo Wild Wings",2
"I only came here for a nose piercing, but this place is absolutely professional and top notch. I am not very familiar with piercings body mod, but these guys are pros and put my mind at ease. I have total confidence in these folks. I can't comment on the tattoo artists as I did not venture into that, but I hear they are excellent.",2
"Delicious food! Great family place. The guy always remembers me and my husband and remembers what we order. The hummus and pita bread is amazing! We had a greek place when we were stationed in Texas, but now here in Vegas, we were worried there would be to many places to have any place of real worth. I am so glad we found this place! This is exactly what we needed.",2
"No stars. Great place, terrible scam. I never signed on for any commitment or cancellation fees. They want 50 and two forms of ""proof "" that I moved, as if my lease and the fact that I haven't been there in months isn't evidence enough. They want 10 to mail me a copy of my agreement where I signed off on this scam.",1
"Way overpriced for mediocre food. Yes, it's on the strip which makes sense, but if you really want good Asian food, head over to the area around Spring Mountain Road. Anyway, their spicy tofu soup was about as spicy as the rice we ate with and the service was poor. Also the pho didn't even come with basil. Sorry to say we won't be returning.",1
"This place is awesome! The spicy chicken is great, has a nice kick to it, but not overpowering. after eating a whole meal of it, you will have a nice warm burn in your mouth. All is great, but what is funny is Id have to say, some of the worst katsu chicken I have ever had in my life, just avoid that.",2
"My dog Zelda's newest name is Kujo. And she hates men. But Rodney wasn't afraid! I've boarded Zelda at the Doggie Dude Ranch 3 or 4 times now and she is calmer and better behaved each time I pick her up. Rodney has been extremely helpful, accomodating, and flat out awesome! Plus, the prices beat any other facility in town!",2
"I dont see how you could give less than five stars. This show is amazing, the people are far more talented then any one of us that are rating them. Taking out of consideration that they people are slightly nude, the show is amazing and the people are truly talented! I do think that you have to be a little open minded before going to this show, but hey, we're all adults here!",2
"Mediocre tapas. Also, the inside of the restaurant was uncomfortably hot on a scorching day and when I complained to the waitress, she told me that's how they keep it. We ended up eating outside. Servive was slow. A potato dish with no fish tasted fishy. It seems that Las Vegas still only has one tapas place Firefly.",1
"Super endroit pour un verre et un peu de bouffe u00e7a va de soi consid u00e9rant la formule tapas mais disons que ce n'est vraiment pas un endroit pour un repas en bonne et d u00fbe forme, c'est pas un resto. Les tapas sont bien, mais je ne suis pas tomb u00e9 sur le cul pour autant. Correct. Belle s u00e9lection de vins. Ambiance dynamique et agr u00e9able.",2
"We were spoiled by an amazing Thai place very close to our last home out East, but Na Rai is good and we go back for our regular Thai fix now. Mostly we do takeout, but the service is generally very attentive. The sushi is pretty good, but we typically might only order a roll as an app, not typically the main course. Food is good, although a bit salty at times. Give it a shot.",2
"Appetizers were ok, main course horrible. Grilled lobster tails came out raw, they did bring another serving, these too were barely cooked. The halibut was similar to chewing on a shoe. For the prices they charge we will not be going back. It seems like everyone who goes there has been brainwashed to think they are getting a good meal.",1
"I wouldn't have had a problem paying high prices for mediocre food if at least the service was good. You would think that being as close as they are to US Airways center that they would staff accordingly too. No such luck tonight. 70 later, still hungry and thirsty, I would not recommend this place to anyone. Managers should pay more attention to the guests less to the hostesses.",1
"Walked In Today and asked for a fill. The lady told me there was an extremely long wait. There was only one other person in the chair and she was already being worked on and insinuates I should leave. I left. If you don't want my business, I certainly won't give it to you. Went to another salon and had to wait, I don't mind having to wait at all, it was the tone that was used.",1
"This place is a cross between a swap meet and a. Well I guess it's just like a mexican swap meet but indoors. They have good food, fruits, drinks, and countless snacks, oh yeah and the seafood is fresh and tasty. The crap the vendors sell is pretty much that, crap, but you wouldn't really expect less from a indoor swap meet, that is literally attached to the most ghetto mall in all of the valley.",2
"Best new restaurant in Charlotte! Hands down the most incredible Italian food I've had in this state. Authentic with fresh sauces and pastas. Incredible entrees, excellent service and a unique and fitting atmosphere! It's amazing! Make a reservation. Stagioni is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Very impressed! Keep it up moffet brothers, you never disappoint.",2
"This is probably one of the most disappointing buffets I have had in Vegas. They charge brunch prices for breakfast. No crab legs, no shrimp.the food looks less than appetizing and it looks like its been sitting there for awhile. For the price, I expected a lot more.the only thing that was ok was the omelet bar and the guy serving the omelets.",1
"Just tried Noodle and Rice for lunch. I got the Teriyaki Vegetables w chicken lunch special. The food was really good, the vegetables were crispy and seemed fresh, and you can't beat their prices. My only complaint was that it took about 20min to get my food to go, but that is an easy fix to simply call ahead next time. Will definitely be going again.",2
"Used to come in this place quite a lot, but my last time was so crummy I wont be back. brought my kids in here and it's changed. You know how it is when you really like and know a place then you go in and it's different. Service is off, food is off, and prices have gone up. Not worth the hassle. One crappy night at this place was enough to lose me for life. Later!",1
"I'm a fan of this place. I try to stay here whenever I'm in Vegas. It's hip and trendy. The prices are usually pretty good and sometimes, they'll even upgrade your room for free. The crowd is young and I've seen several celebrities hanging out. They also have the Pleasure Pit to keep gamblers and onlookers entertained.",2
If you order online and it's wednesday or later in the week DO NOT use 2d day UPS you will not get your part unless you're very close by. I'm in Texas and ordered on wednesday thinking I could get my parts by saturday latest.nope 5 days later they arrive what the Hell is 2 day air? needless to say no more business from me. Yes I wrote them and they didn't have the courtesy to reply either.,1
"I was really looking forward to trying this place, and I was really hungry. Unfortunately, this place made my bf and myself very sick. Almost immediately after we ate the chicken bento box, we both knew we made a mistake. I'm not quite sure why our bodies reacted that way, but it's always good to let people know. Ambiance, and location great though!",1
"This place is fast, charges less than the last place I went and the people are very nice. I had a jumping thing I had purchased but couldn't assemble myself I asked any chance I could pay them to put it together for me they did it , tossed it in the back of the car, and wouldn't let me pay anything for it beyond the regular price of the inspection.",2
"The carpet is dirty. They need to remodel the rooms. Everything is outdated. The only reason I book this hotel is convenience. It is walking distance to the mall, Venetian and Walgreens. I got the Southwest Vacation Package.I went there Friday June 17 to Monday June 20, 2011. nI see most of the customers drop off the luggage and gamble at other casinos. Please remodel!",1
"seriously one of the best haircuts ive ever gotten by yaniss and her instructor brett, i cant thank them enough! they made my super thick hair look great, i am going back for color this week! i hope its just as good.like other people have said it is a long process so be prepared and if your on a time schedule then break up your cut and color into different sessions.thats what i ended up doing.",2
"I've been here twice with my wife! We first went since it was directly across the street from where we were staying, the Wynn, but this time we found our way up from Mandalay bay since it's so tasty and affordable! They recommended a shot in my chocolate shake. DELISH! Anyway. find your way up here. it's great.",2
"Great food, but was a little slow on the service and a tad expensive for what you get. i think there are better places in town that have the same menu or close. If you live in the Summerlin area and want to a short trip with good food, Nittaya's is a safe bet. But if you live elsewhere, use the gas to hit up other places around town.",2
"Excellent food and service. Definitely make a reservation and preferably early to avoid dishes being sold out. I was looking forward to the meat and potatoes for 2 but it was sold out by the time we sat down. Still, the pot roast and hanger steak were amazing. Would definitely recommend if you're not on a budget.",2
"Awesome hangout! Went on a Wednesday night and had the place to ourselves! An opportunity to have the stage to ourselves and sing our hearts out. Staff was quirky, irreverent and fun. Excellent song selection and Jell O shots too! Don't let negative reviews steer you away alcohol may be involved and if you're looking for a dive bar to make yourself at home this is the place.",2
"Honestly the best place to eat in Vegas. and The best part . it's NOT on the strip. Whatever you order you will be impressed. The wait for this place is sometimes one hr. and there's a reason for it. Tuna Tar Tar, Steak Sliders and Dates and the apple salad. I can go on for ever. This is a LAS VEGAS Must Eat.",2
"Definitely showing it's age. nWas attending a convention, and upgraded to the Octavius Wing. Liked the coffee in the morning down at the separate check in area. nBut the tile in bathroom is getting grimey, shower fixture was rickety, bed sagged. nI hope my convention is in a different hotel next year.",1
"We ate there on Thursday. Freddie Glessmen greated us warmly, chatted, and sent over some complimentary appetizers. The steak was perfect, flavorful, tender, and delicious. The penne ala vodka was good. The sword fish a bit overdone. Service was prompt but some of the staff under trained. If the busboy put his elbow in my face one more time I was going to practice my jujitsu.",2
"Frank Sinatra on the sound system, The Godfather on the TVs. spare me, please. I particularly enjoyed the 10 or so photos of the owner with d list celebrities that kept scrolling on the TVs that weren't playing the Godfather. The food was decent but the whole ""Staten Island via South Philly "" ambience pretty much ruined it.",1
"too much dance and note enough ""action "". I saw the Cirque years ago and Disney and was blown away. I had high hopes for this show but I was disappointed. the beatles music is great and there were some good moments but overall it was very uneven. It was also dark not sure where the love is in this show except for the end when they sing ""all you need is love. "" it seems like a missed opportunity.",1
"Very disappointing experience. Had heard great things but did not live up to hype. Good beer selection and the mac and cheese was very good. Ribs were luke warm and very dry, tasted like they had sat under a heat lamp for a while. Server spent more time texting than servng. Defintely not worth the price",1
"So maybe I just have crappy luck with this place but every time I go in, which isn't often, they run out of chicken. Ugh. How does a chicken place repeatedly run out of chicken? And every time I go in I wait forever and a day for my order. The two stars are because the food is decent and the cashier was friendly. I'd like to say I wont be back but.",1
They don't even deserve this star sadly. This is the worst location I've been to. They are always very slow and they make far too many mistakes on simple orders. There have been multiple incidences where they didn't even bother to mix the flavor into the slush just leaving bare crushed ice and syrup splotches. The worst! Never coming to this location again.,1
I went here after a short trip to Las Vegas.the restaurant is located in the Red Rock Hotel and Casino in Summerlin. I didn't know that this was a large sandwich chain like Subway or Jersey Mike's. I ordered a foot long meatball sub and I have to admit that it was really good. The sauce was excellent and had spices that I really couldn't identify. Overall a great experience.,2
"I usually go for ice cream at Food Truck Friday but I'm glad I got a cupcake at Sizzling Saturday this week! I had the pumpkin cheesecake and it was delicious, not at all dry like some cupcakes. We bought a four pack and the next day I ate a chocolate cupcake that was amazing! If you bring your box back and buy another four pack, you get a fifth cupcake free!",2
"I'm a regular and yesterday as I was dining there for lunch I thought this place is so good I'll have to put in a good word. I doubt there are any better ribs in town and the hot sauce on the side adds to the delicious experience. The sides are better than expected, I like the fired okra and potato thing. .Overall, very good for lunch or dinner and not overpriced.",2
"When the basic quoted charge is 50 higher than my regular groomer, and extras include 1.00 per minute for dematting included in other groomer's basic charges , it just doesn't make sense to go here, especially when having to wait for 7 other ""regular "" customers go ahead of me. I only checked out this place because it's closer to home.but I will stick with Canine Carousel from now on.",1
"It was like London all over again! The fish was fresh, crispy, greasy, and delicious! I ordered the cod which was amazing. Scotch egg was okay, I ordered it anyway just because. the chicken and leek pie was decent as well. I wish the have a tasting platter so that people like myself, can just order the tasting and eat the whole menu. Highly recommended when you are in Montreal, QC.",2
"Decided to check this place out since they don't have these back in The Bay. Favorite place to get a sandwich now, come here all the time! I craved these bad boys all throughout my pregnancy, lol. Only bad experience I had was one time I came about half an hour before closing and the employee locked the door on me, rude!",2
"I had a 3.50 steak taco and it was terrific! nEqually I have had the chicken taco and it was also fantastic. nExcellent patio with a nice view of Roosevelt Row with a great mix of fun tropical music. nSeriously, chips and salsa and a 3.50 taco, how can you beat that!?!? nI love it. Side Note at the beginning they did have an issue with the chips not being crisp, that issue has since been resolved.",2
Stopped in with the family for dinner. They have great calzones and i always have to get the meatballs with cheese. The meat balls were a bit on the small size but they usually are not. They have great garlic knots that are complimentary in the evening. Great choice for good Italian and pizza. Much better than the local pizza chains.,2
"So much fun with friends. We came on a saturday night around 1am and sang our hearts out. I will say that drinking soju and eating some rice cake. SEOUL TRAIN is definitely something i haven't seen in person, but did this time around. The songs are really good popular music totally available! LOVED IT!",2
"Less than stellar experience. We came to the drive thru 40 minutes prior to closing to be told that they only had very limited choices, none of which were what I had intended to get when I arrived there. Word to the wise, don't expect black pepper chicken or beef and broccoli in the hour before closing. Not planning on revisiting this panda location.",1
I hate this place! First off the emplyees are terrible! Starting from the first bouncer that put us into the wrong line assuring us it was the guest list line when it was just general. Then when we FINALLY got in and got our drinks the bartender was rude the whole time! The dance floor was also wayyy too packed. We tired to make the most of it but I will never go back!,1
"I had the best experience when purchasing my car from this dealership.Doug Saxton and Terry were so professional and courteous it was amazing.There was no pressure or ""hard sell tactics "" that we all fear when buying a new car.They kept in touch even after I had bought the car.please see them when in the market for a new ride. nBe sure to say Kathie sent you.",2
This is a really nice place to relax and enjoy some good music. Cover charge on a Friday night was 7. There was a funk band playing. They were definitely grooving. They don't have any food here but they will allow you to bring in outside meals. The ambience was incredible! I loved it. Good place for a date. Music lovers must experience!,2
"Hands down, this is my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. Their coffee is amazing, as well as their crepes! I have to stop here everytime I go downtown. The employees are always very friendly, and I love their cute latte art! JoBot is located in a quaint little building with adorable vintage funiture and wood floors.",2
"One of my favorite restaurants in the past, just went with my family for the first time. Was told after I received my order and had asked for something else ""that I had ordered that "". Waiter walks away. Charged for it and nothing was address. Such an embarrassing situation I will never be going back.",1
This place is super awesome! The service was great! Very attentive! The food was absolutely on point. Order the shrimp fajitas and they were delicious! Drinks were amazing and at a reasonable price! Homemade tortillas were delicious! Ugh loved it here! Would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends!,2
"Obese guy wearing a king's crown at the counter. What the heck? Drive thu was the slowest I've seen in my entire life, and I was given a disingenuous apology from the staff who noted that an employee ""just walked out "". No attempt to make it right, no free food, no discounted order, nothing. This is place is hard to beat. Interior is very dirty too.",1
The atmosphere is nice its very clean and well put together. nIts kind of unfair to compare this Geno's to the real Geno's and Pats in Philly. Its safe to say its not even close but to be fair They just opened up and I've only been to this Genos once. n Now they do have more then just Philly Cheese steaks. So I'm looking forward to giving it another shot. But for now its only gets 2 1 2 stars.,1
"I ate here for dinner on a Tuesday and I thought the food was delicious and the draft beer list was one of the better in the Tempe area. I tasted the Fun Guy pizza and the Thai Dye pizza. Both were very good the Thai Dye in particular was inventive. It tasted like indian food and pizza had a yummy love child. The service was a bit slow, but it was very friendly courteus.",2
"Pinkberry has to be the best yogurt place in my opinion. Compared to insert other yogurt place here , the flavors at Pinkberry actually taste like what they are meant to taste like! This is a great addition to Boca Park. I would personally recommend the chocolate hazelnut. The only thing that brings this place down is the small number of options for flavors, but oh well.",2
"I was recently introduced to this restaurant and love it! Their beer samplers are great and appetizers delicious. They do get pretty busy, but that has to say something about their business, right? The staff is friendly and willing to share their experience with the items on the menu. I like the option they have up at the bar area, like a ""seat yourself "" type area.",2
"First place I've eaten in Montreal, I was surprised to see others reviewing the place as pricey I'm guessing these people don't goto many other restaurants especially veg ones We came in an hour before the kitchen closed, place was packed and we still got seated and served quickly. Both the service and the food were good and I think we'd definitely return.",2
Most people don't know this but you DONT HAVE TO BE 21 TO SALE BEER OR ANY LICOR ! nTo serve yes ! nIs annoying evry time . But the best if the best nOnce it was an old Asian lady no problem ringing my beer 95 of the time I don't get I'd check well she did not ask for it cool easy right but one my last items. spray paint. .I'D PLEASE! ! nWTF.,1
"The front door man told me it would be a certain amount to get in the door, then when I went to pay the woman inside charged way less. Seems like the door man was just trying to make extra cash. The place wasn't that busy at all, and I didn't like the music. It definitely wasn't worth the cover. I have a much better time at free clubs in Old Town with better music.",1
"I finally had a slice of one of their layer cakes a white cake with rum and raspberries. It was too sweet, not rummy enough and not tart enough for my tastes, but very much to most people's tastes. I'm giving it 4 stars because all of my friends would have rolled their eyes and sighed contentedly after tasting it. And it's still way, way, way better than most places.",2
We decided to stop by for a quick snack after some lounging by the pool. There were 8 of us and I have to say everything we ordered looked much better then it tasted! It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. I found the food to be mediocore at best. The place it's self is a treat for the eyes but looks aren't everything and Jean Philippe Patisserie proves it!,1
"After looking at the menu online we went in for lunch, only to find they did not serve it. The menu indicated that savory items were available. We travelled a cross town and we're very diss appointed. Don't be fooled by the advertisement of a ""cupcake bar "". It is a few jars of sprinkles. The cupcakes had more frosting than cake. Not impressed.",1
Bruce is awsome! When I had a blue screen yes blue . One call Bruce was on the case. He backed up my memory then he did what he needed to get me up running again. Nothing lost on my computer! nI also used him to unlock my computer from a program. He did this online from his home and I was at mine. 10 minutes and fixed! nI highly recommend Computer Troubleshooters for all your computer needs.,2
"I have been here twice in the last few weeks and really enjoyed the food and view the porch seating. They have nice little touches like adding cucumbers to the water. Excellent humus. I have tried the chicken kabobs and brisquit.both were a little salty, but the rest of the meal more than made up for it.",2
Finally got to try Costa Vida tonight and glad we did! Fresh and flavorful meats and options. Not a Filibertos but not a real sit down either. Some interesting menu items make it different enough to fill the gap and be another good Mexican option in the area! The Honey Habenero salsa is really quite good too!,2
"I will not be eating here again. I had ordered an appetizer, salad and coffee. The appetizer plate was never cleared from the table and my salad was drenched in dressing, but I was given a gallon of coffee. Awesome combo! The waiter was hardly attentive and I got more face time with the food runner. I could understand if they had been swamped, but every other booth and table was empty.",1
"I came here strictly to find my CANDY MELTS so I could make some brownie pops! I found the pop sticks immediately but could't find the candy melts! I was like They HAVE to be here, SOMEWHERE! They weren't in the same aisle as the other candy making supplies but if you turned the corner, BAM! CANDY MELTS IN YO FACE! Lots of varieties so I was SET!",2
"Went to pure. It was my friends bday so as we walked up we were wooing and laughing. When we go there Jack said that we couldn't get In because ""she was to drunk "" and looked at the bday girl. When we said that that she hadn't had a drink he said that the other girls had to sober up. Make up your mind!",1
"I'm from A small town in NC and when I moved here I had large expectations of Las Vegas and crafty, original people. Honestly this tiny Michaels was a huge disappointment. My Michaels at home was way larger with a way bigger selection. Plus I usually have to argue tha AC Moore is a competitor to get them to accept my coupons. Ugh",1
"I can't comment on the actual services because we ended up walking out after waiting over an hour for a pedicure that was said to be only a 15 minute wait. In the hour we were there, not one person was finished and four people still sat waiting in the chairs to have a nail tech even come over. Sorry, there are too many other nail places around. We will never come back again.",1
"I have been getting my hair done here at Salon Indigo, by Sara, for over 3 years and caot say enough about what a wonderful job she does. I get stopped yes literally and complimented on my hair. I have a very short spikey hair cut and Sara cuts it better than anyone ever has! Highly recommend this salon!",2
"Greenbush is an institution. Whether you're meeting someone for a drink some authentic Italian antipasto or you're planning a noisy family reunion with pizza to die for, this inconspicuous basement hideaway has it all. Top it off with a good wine selection fabulous wait staff that don't pester you, and you might think you're back in Italy for a second. A must do whether you live in Madison or not.",2
"Got seated and waited about 10 mins. Someone came over to my table, and I thought, ""okay, here we go "" and the girl just said ""I'll be right back to take your order. "" No water, no silverware. Another 5 10 minute wait and still no sign of my server making it over to my table, dispite helping all her other tables. So, I got up and left.",1
Best Japanese buffet. Unlimited fresh oysters! What more can I ask for? Love how theres a big good variety of sushi and desert! You must go. You wont be disappointed This place is always busy so you know people really come back for the food. Sushi doesnt taste mediocre as well even though its a buffet. They always keep their selections fresh!,2
"Oh Yelp, you VERY RARELY let me down. How you have misguided me! This place has 4 stars!?!? In Arizona!? Bless their hearts, they tried. Beans tasted fake, salty, and microwaved to molten hot pocket lava status. Tortilla was disgusting, and far from authentic. I don't understand these reviews. IS THIS REAL LIFE?!? I am Hispanic, so I am critical of Mexican food, but still, don't tease me Yelp!",1
"Sun Devil Chicken. Try it. House Special Chicken. Try it. These are dishes that are distinct enough from standard Chinese fare to bring me back again and again. Though the Abacus looks like any other standard strip mall Chinese, the creativity the owners show on these two items sets it apart in my mind. I've been going there for about 13 years now. An old favorite.",2
"Sat outside at our table for about 20 minutes as servers walked past us over and over. Finally flagged one down and the look on his face was like ""Oh, didn't see you there "" as if we magically became corporeal. Granted I came on a Sunday around 11am, but 20 minutes without even being acknowledged really grinds my gears. The food was OK but nothing special. Plenty of better breakfast places around.",1
Our company ordered to cakes to be presented to our husband this weekend as a Birthday Surprise. The cakes were made beautifully looked better than anticipated and they tasted so wonderful. I had the peanut butter cream one made for my husband and it is a huge hit. So fresh and moist. I think I might gain a pant size though!,2
"This place used to be strickly Chinese food, but trendiness has added a Japanese flair. They have a good selection menu item. They have wide selection of alcohol and other beverages including saki. The atmosphere is low key. They had a display case with some sale items for sale at the front. It's pretty much the only sushi place in Casa Grande. . .luckily I don't eat sushi.",1
The NEW America's Taco Shop opened today and I was the first most 1 customer. As usual I had the Carne Asada Torta and it was fantastic. So good in fact that I went back and got a Carne Asada Burrito to go for dinner which also makes me the first repeat customer . Great new location on 7th Ave just south of Campbell.,2
"It's a standard hotel, meaning okay decent amenities but lacking in customer service. I'm Hyatt Platinum status and just experienced a confrontation with the front desk but was unable to come to means with the staff. I chose to walk away rather than waste my breathe. Probably will not be staying here again over a simple ""Policy "" issue!",1
"A great getaway resort offering ultimate luxury, unparalleled service, endless recreation and exquisite cuisine. Surrounded by the grandeur of the McDowell Mountains, JW Marriott Desert Ridge offers a pampering spa, world class dining and championship golf. And they have a Kids Club where the kids can play while me and the Mrs. relax!",2
"Ok food, but horrible service had to ask several times for water. Waitress never checked back in to see how the meal was. It took her three trips to finally ask if we were ready to order etc. Would not recommend and wished I read the other reviews first. They all say the same thing about service. Total bummer because the space is pretty.",1
"All hail Sprouts produce. I may shop elsewhere for nonperishables, but I always make a special trip to this Sprouts for their vegetables. I've gone to other markets Ahem.Whole Foods. and the vegetables go bad almost as soon as I get them home. At Sprouts, I feel the produce is much fresher. Not to mention, I can get so much without breaking the bank.",2
"Horrible! The person massaging me was obviously a smoker! Ew, how much can u relax with tobacco aroma? Besides that, my friend told me the person massaging her was asking inappropriate questions, getting too personal, and dropping the F word every other sentence! I will never go back there again. You're better off paying a little extra and enjoying yourself rather than waiting to get out!",1
"I hate this mall. Whoever said it was Metrocenter for the East Valley is right. nParking is always a nightmare, the single story let's all walk in a circle like cattle layout sucks and it is screaming baby stroller central. I give this mall one star only because of the Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs in the food court.",1
"This must be our 25th visit here. My wife and I love this place. The food is good and reasonably priced. They do have a few unusual items on the menu cerviche and grilled cactus plus a few more . The service overall is good. Having been here so many times we have had a couple of visits where the service has been less than good, but that is not the norm. Come try it, you will be glad you did",2
"After years of hoping from one hair salon to the next, I finally settled on Cardamone's. This salon caters to customers of all ages and types from Downtown businessmen to students at the nearby Point Park University. The styling tools and products are top of the line and always leave my hair with a beautiful finish. The staff are very friendly, especially my stylist Marisa.",2
"Vegas has lost it's superb customer service, which is one of the reasons why I used to come out here so often. This place has changed my mind and has brought me hope. The servers work as a team to accommodate to the customers needs. Not only is the customer service great but the food is delicious. Hands down one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eaten at! Enjoy!",2
"After waiting two and a half hours for my food and calling four times the woman I spoke too blamed me for not answering my phone. The reason I did not answer was because they called the wrong number, which they also typed incorrectly on the receipt which the driver showed me while he apologized for the stupidity of his coworkers. The food was horrible. I fed it to my dog. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1
"HORRIBLE customer service! After 10 years of my 5 children seeing them and hoping each time they might be more friendly or accommodating, but continuing because we live so close. We are done with you Mesa Pediatrics! We are paying customers with great insurance, you could care less. We are taking our money elsewhere!",1
"Pros Nice ambience, fairly strong margaritas. nCons The last time I went, the service was not great. The waitress got our orders wrong, never refilled our water, and never came back with the salsa we asked for. It wasn't busy at all, either. The food is just so so. Everything seemed overcooked and not very thoughtfully seasoned. It's certainly no Mas Amigos or Maize.",1
"Beef rumba salad is light, refreshing and somewhat healthy. Dressing optional as it's so tasty with salsa only. Oh! and don't forget to squeeze lime on it. nFlavors are great, serving size is a bit small for the price paid. Seems a small salad like this one shouldn't be close to 7.00, I'd think more around 5.00. nAmbience is sort of beachy if you use your imagination.",1
"This is the most authentic Chinese food I've found since I've returned from Southeast Asia. Anything you order is going to be fantastic and authentic. This is not a place for people who think ""orange chicken "" is Chinese food. This is high quality cuisine for Chinese prices. If you're looking for something authentic, this is the place.",2
"Yeah, really bummed out about this. I was so excited to try this place and it just really disappointed. The pizza was plain and boring. We ordered the sausage and onion one and there was nothing compelling about it. The house salad was great, but I came here for the pizza. Not enough sauce, too much bread. Blah.",1
"After long debate of where to have lunch, I am glad that I stopped into The Greek Pita. I had ordered the lamb gyro with everything except onions. The gyro was loaded with lamb meat and toppings. The pita was soft and fresh. The Tzatziki sauce has a nice tang to it. It tasted light, cool, and creamy. The total cost was 5.74 tax. I left with a very happy belly.",2
"I love this car wash. Very friendly employees and the prices are so reasonable for their detail work.you don't even have to make an appointment just get up early and it's first come first serve on detailing. We do all three of our vehicles there, plus the horse trailer which looks stunning after they are done with it.",2
"This one was located at the Miracle Mile. The service was great. We were seated quickly and the waitress was nice, but. I ordered the fish tacos. Never again. I was served two tacos with one over overcooked tiny fish stick in each taco. Even the rice and beans were awful. I've had better Rice a Roni spanish rice. For good cheap fish tacos go to Rubios !",1
I can't believe this hotel is joined with the Paris hotel. The Paris hotel is way classier and Bally's is stuck in another world like a dead end mall in an 80s film or some stereotypical trashy and tobacco filled Vegas . Even Frank Sinatra wouldn't have come here back in the day if it was built at the time . I didn't even stay here and I couldn't stand the casino nor pathetic mall after 5 minutes.,1
The store has a weird rotting meat smell sometimes. The selection isn't amazing but there are a few interesting items here. As other people commented there are always people hanging around outside. But they are friendly at least to me! One thing I like about the store is the proximity to my house. The biggest let down is the sky high prices that I think GE is notorious for. I miss Kroger,1
"Came in a few times before and ordered drinks with dinner. The trick to liking this place is to order drinks at the counter. That was you get to see the giant hunk of ginger, see the bar tenders squeezing limes, watch them actuallly muddle drinks with care. The drinks are good, but the show, even better.",2
I found this place just in time as the weather is getting cooler and a soup and sandwich place is what one craves. I order the turkey panini and mushroom bisque soup which were quite good. The chocolate covered strawberry that comes with it makes for the perfect end of meal change of palette. They seem to have a wide variety so i have to come back and try the other stuff.,2
"This is an update to my previous review, When I sent the payment in, with a letter explaining why we shouldn't be responsible for the charged, I was sent a letter telling me that Dr. Glick decided to waive the charge. This has restored my faith in all the great things I have heard about this office. I will go again and I will make sure that I know what my coverage should be. Thank you Dr, Glick!",2
"Been a few times, ordered the same thing both times only to be told just as everyone else's food is coming out that they were out of what I ordered. My food didnt come out until everyone else was done eating and it was time to leave part of my meal actually came out as we were walking out the door .but I was still charged full price though! I will not be back.",1
Went there for Lunch in the middle of the aft. No one there except staff. nFood was wonderful Ceviche for appetizer. Southwest Cobb salad and Jalape u00f1o Burger. Super! nService was absolutely terrible! Had to go to kitchen door to find any staff to help us after being served. nBut. I will go back.,1
"Maybe it's just me but, I think the fingers are DRY and not very hot compared to the canes on Las Vegas blvd out by the Belz mall. And, have alot of kids running the place. It's funny also, I asked for extra dipping sauce and the girl behind the counter goes ""HUH "" I said huh? How about excuse me? Lol. Just my 2 cents! Late.",1
OK this is not a grand anything. The prices are way too high here! 40 per person. The food was sub par and I ending up getting food poisoning from the prime rib. I would avoid this place. At LVH our buffet was 40 for two people and that includes unlimited beer and wine. Also I didn't get sick. Stay away from MGM Grand buffet or you could end up puking your guts out. I'd give it 3 stars if I could.,1
"Can't Find a record shop? nThats because theirs only a handful in the AZ area. LWR has weathered the storm over the years when downloading has crushed local music stores. The selection is more for House, Trance, Drum Bass and more. Not so much hip hop. Services, turntable repair, and mixer repair. Personally I don't know of any other place that does this.",2
Over priced. Horribly cooked burger. Bad layout of the main floor. You want a better burger? Go to the Tilted Kilt a block away. Better layout and timely service? Go to Arrogant Butcher. Restaurant closed at 10pm in the city! It has a bar! The drinks were decent.but nothing to make me stay there. Much better places to go within walking distance for the price.,1
Run out of everything an hour after they open. I try to order souffl u00e9 and they always are out or run out of the bowls they put it in. I'm disappointed in this panera. I never had this issue at any paneras in Minnesota. They lost me as a customer and I am definitely not recommending this place to anyone.,1
"I posted pics of the food we had oysters and fish tacos. The oysters were wonderful! Very friendly, courteous service. The restaurant smelled a little funny, maybe it was the fish and bleach for cleaning mixed together that was weird but it put me off a little. It is quite a drive from the Vegas strip, about 20 30 mins b c it's all street. Other than that, I would go back for the oysters.",1
Have to say this is probably one of my favorite buffets in town. Definitely in my top 5! The food is always fresh and lots to choose from. Love the milkshakes and gyro station. One thing they could improve is the deserts. Price is very reasonable at whatever time you go! Oh this buffet is at Green Valley Ranch,2
"When I need some electronics this is my spot to go. nThey have all you can think off plus they do price match from some websites like Amazon, best buy, and more. nThe guys over there very professional and you can ask them any question you want. nIf you need some electronics don't look any further just go over there and you won't regret it.",2
"We were excited to try this place out, we love mexican and heard good things. Big let down. The food was average, but the service was terrible. My 2 year old couldn't sit and wait anymore, I ended lunch walking around outside with him because our food took so long. No drink or chip refills. Come on people! nSkip this place and go to the original El Encanto instead.",1
"I enjoy the dog grooming room, my pup is scared of the big box groomer we previously went to. Here I can do it myself with all the supplies assistance if requested. Great selection of toys, treats, and food for a variety of pets. I especially like the amount of affordable all natural products. Pets are welcome! Great way to shop LOCAL!",2
"i haven't been here in awhile but did find a pretty good selection when i did, what annoyed me the most and drove me out of the store b4 i was really finished looking was the DING, DING bell that went off EVERY time soneone came in or out. i know why they do it and it's not for the customer. until they stop and Kohl's did awhile back , i'm not coming back!",1
"This is my first review. I think eveyone should know to never fly US Airlines. The customer service people were super RUDE. They over charge for everything. If it looks like a deal, it's not at the end. I could say much more but why. Try anyone else. By the way I fly a lot and have never seen anything like this company's treatment of customers!",1
"Charlotte's got a lot of great pizza places, but for my money, Libretto's is near the top. The pizza's about as authentic, NY style as it gets, the pasta dishes are wonderful, and the garlic knots out of this world. Kid friendly atmosphere and a convenient Ballantyne location make Libretto's a must.",2
"The beer selection here disappointed me, very laid back bar that can be a great hang out for friends on the weekend. The drinks are fairly priced but the whole theme of the restaurant bar threw me off. It was disappointing that the whole patio was smoking friendly I do not smoke and could barely breathe out there so I was left with the only option to be inside.disappointing.",1
"What can you ask for as a Chinese in Las Vegas. to have a dim sum place around the Sin City China town. However, the fact that I am from the San Francisco Bay Area. makes this restaurant a really so so so so place. No offensive.but remember, You are in Vegas.not Macau. so, having more authentic Chinese food around is already a good thing",1
"Not worth the time. If I could leave ZERO STARS I WOULD. It's hotter inside than outside asked them to turn the AC down, couldn't do it. It was like we were bothering them to wait on us we were the only people in here for the 10 minutes we stayed. Brought our drinks in cans red solo cups with ice. We paid for the drinks went someplace else",1
"theyre reopening in a week or 2! new owners, promising the same food and menu dave will be back temporarily to show them the business, also remodeling the place! when i saw the for lease sign i felt i lost the love of my life! now im glad to hear theyre back and for good! the cheese whiz and onions is my recommendation! pops has nothing on this place!",2
"Purchased a Tempur pedic bed, dining room set, and bar stools our first time at this store. Roger, our sales associate was extremely helpful in helping us arrive at just the right product for us in each case. The prices were competitive and the product quality excellent. Delivery was done exactly when promised within a narrow time window.",2
"Don't go there for the ambiance or for a luxurious experience because it has neither , but go there for the cheap sushi, fully customizable menu, and decent presentation. The concept itself is cool and it's well executed. Not exactly a place I'd take my date to, but if you want a quick fix, this would be the place to go to.",2
"sometimes, i like to pretend that i'm staring at the fountains alongside danny ocean his posse. and then the record skips. i didn't just screw over andy garcia. i'm not going to be in a sequel. or two. and i just got smacked in the leg by some unruly 5 year old with slurpee hands. .it's just one of those things you ""gotta do "" in vegas. and it's free.",2
"No more going to this frys ever again. I live so close I can throw a rock and hit them, but I will now go out of my way to not go there ever again. It smells awful. So awful I turned around to leave as soon as I walked in. It is a gross pee sort of sewer smell that has permeated the whole place. No thanks, I'll go to another from now on. Ew!",1
"Waited for 12 freaking Minutes in drive thru from the time i ordered for the kids meal version of the terriyaki chicken. If it wasnt for my child who is limited to certain foods because of allergies, i wouldve just drove away without getting anything even though i paid. Not that anyone from this business will see this anyway. One star because i cant choose zero",1
"I was assigned housing here for a month while I worked in Vegas the room smelled like an ashtray and the carpet was nasty. I can overlook many things but cigarette smoke smell is a pet peeve of mine. The ""tenants "" that lived above me throw their cigarette butts in front of my door. Recognize these are not condos maybe at one time but are apartments. I will not stay here again.",1
"2 stars for some halfassed service. nIt was 5am and the place was empty. the server seemed a bit off too. dragged his feet as if he was half a zombie. nFood took foreverrrrrrrrr, asked for straws 3 times, needed napkins, bill took forever, omg. On a brighter note, the chicken lettuce wraps were good and filling. Didn't feel so guilty for eating at 5am ",1
"Good food I ordered beef broccoli and lemon chicken the lemon chicken was deep fried which I wasn't expecting, but it was alright! I'd order these again . The deep fried wontons were great and the egg roles were some of the best I've had not slimy on the inside like many places I've been to . I ordered delivery and it took 1h 10mins to get here but it came HOT so I was okay with that ",2
As soon as I sat down you can hear the kitchen staff bickering over the music. Once my entree arrived Chicken Larb the servers only came back to my table to give me my check. They didn't check on us once. Even after we made eye contact. The Larb had too much onion and rice powder. It was way too gritty. I finished a 3rd of it.,1
First Bar is a great place to grab a Stella and munch on some gourmet bar food. The music is loud and the girls are hot. Really fun atmosphere and the cool lounge seating. All the food I ordered was very good. The BLT with avocado to the Philly cheese steak dumplings all were unique and super tasty. I recommend First Bar anytime of the day to grab a bite to eat or enjoy a glass of beer.,2
I enjoy the wings.if I am doing a party of some kind. We use to go here often but staff are clueless on how to treat people. So I go as little as I can. And also when Im not spending my own hard earned cash. I feel I wont pay you to disrespect me. When they lose enough clients they will dish out better attitudes.,1
Mother's Dy Brunch 3 adults and 1 child 180.00 only drinks were 2 waters and 2 teas gratuity was included in bill so service was barely passable. Food was okay but not worth the price charged. However the crepes were awesome the saving grace. The entertainment was good and the atmosphere fine. Probably would NOT go back. Don't see a good value. Do not recommend.,1
"There is a reason why this is the best show in Vegas. Went there with my family and sat in the spalsh zone. It indeed is like a dream, I would love to give out more details but don't want to steal the thunder. All I will say is dont miss this show Even when sitting in the 1st row.of.spalsh.zone we hardly got wet, so dont carry any cover rain protections. just sit back and enjoy.",2
"Nancy, Dr. Monahan and all of the staff have beeothing but patient, understanding and professional in every interaction I have had. I have had minor emergencies where I needed to get in the same day or next and they have always accommodated me. I was referred here by my girlfriend and I never have regretted coming here. Nothing but the best from this office and staff.",2
"Great location, at the mall of course. I understood it was a busy day but the technician that did the pre exam was very thorough, knowledgeable and very friendly. Although it is located at the Boulevard Mall, this office is io way ghetto in action, shape or form. The team that seels the eye glasses next door are just as professional.",2
"Wonderful selection of sweet goodies, amazing tea, and good atmosphere. The matcha lattes are delicious and frothy. Although it can be quite loud at times, Chai is one of my favorite places to study. Too bad getting a seat can be difficult during exam season. I love to go at night when it's pretty empty.",2
Nothing worth going back for.except for the beer which was fantastic. Food made me think of glorified leftovers and overpriced at that. I had the steak sandwich and was very underwhelmed. It came on two pieces of what tasted like wonderbread and the gondolza sp was almost nonexistent. Great atmosphere and our waitress was very attentive. Don't think I'll be back for the food though.,1
"horrible. ordered 1 piece of cheese pizza. waited waited waited. owner complained about partner not showing to relieve him. waited waited watied. owner 1 puts on his coat and walks out. owner 2 walks in. waited waited waited. i walk out. owner 1 asks me as i am walking out door ""dont you want your pizza? it will only take a minute. """,1
"Popped in here looking for some dress slacks.the selection was terrible. Normally, TJ Maxx has a nice selection of dress pants and shirts, but this location was very disappointing. The store was very disorganized too, stuff everywhere. They weren't busy, so I'm not sure what happened.maybe I caught them on a bad day? or a tornado ripped through it? Return Factor 32 ",1
"This place is amazing. Get all your lattes hot they actually make the designs on top! Honey vanilla latte is amazing. So good. Cool, hipster vibe. They also have deals I forget exactly what the deal is, I apologize on all their bakery items during the mid afternoon I ended up getting a delicious muffin for very cheap, I think just a couple bucks if I remember correctly!",2
"Michael's is my favorite dessert type stop in Madison. You see ice cream, gelato, sorbet, and frozen yogurt all over the place. But frozen custard is a superior breed of dairy goodness. I never get tired of Michael's custard. They offer many mixes and flavors, and each one can quench your cravings. It's pricier than ice cream, but that's because, again, frozen custard is superior.",2
Such a great place to go and unwind. Your first time get you get an extra 30 minutes free for a massage. I emailed them at the end of the day at 4 30pm and they called me back right away and were able to get me in that evening. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend this place.,2
"I really don't like this place. Their service is so terrible. They always give me an attitude, and they're oh so rude. The only reason I come here is my friends like some of their drinks. I don't want to be a picky snob and insist we go somewhere else. I'll never have a day where I'll be like, ""hey, let's go to tea station! "" Icy juicy will provide a much better service.",1
"A little pricey for what you get, but that's to be expected on the strip. Came here for lunch, and the service was good. The burger and fries were quite good, even though I was expecting a little larger portion size. It is Vegas right? Overall, it was a good eating experience, and I would definitely opt for it over a few of the casinos.",2
I frequent this Which Wich regularly. The food is generally quite good and reliable. Today a young maamed Patrick came by our table to check on us. I was missing an ingredient in my salad which Patrick promptly brought to me. My friend's sand wich wasn't made to her specifications. Patrick gave her a coupon for a complimentary one on her next visit. This is truly good customer service.,2
"Great little shop off of the interstate. I was looking for a place to go that wasn't fast food and wasn't the same old same old. I was surprised how much I liked this place. Made to order deli sandwiches, cheese, fudge, a New Glarus beverage and Southern Comfort? Yes, Southern Comfort. True one stop shopping. I will make this a regular stop between Elgin and Minnesota!",2
"Ordered a Black Forest cake. Not only was it not made with chiffon, it was without cherry cream, chocolate cream and was flavored with coffee. There wasn't any kirsch or brandied cherries. I got an American cake, flavored with coffee and dotted with maraschino cherries. Beware of what you order, just because it is called something doesn't mean that is what it is.",1
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Best of Philly yet. I've been coming here for ten years now and the food is always consistent, tasty and cheap. Yes, the cheesesteaks are delicious, but you HAVE to try their gyros. AMAZING. Just remember your number if you call in for takeout.they don't take your name. Bombsteak!",2
"My first time visiting The Parlor was fantastic! So happy to have a professional Paul Mitchell salon on this side of town! Georgette is Amazing, so friendly and fun let alone talented and professional. She completely understood what I was trying to explain and the end result was exactly the look I wanted! I will absolutely be a returning client!",2
"I saw this restaurant featured on Anthony Bourdains without borders and had to try it. We ordered only from the back of the menu for their famed Northern Thai food and did not regret a single item. We ordered the Nam prik ong, Nam kao tod the Khao soi. The nam kao tod was out of this world I highly recommend it!",2
Happy hour prices are fantastic and the sushi is good but not great. The service my last two visits was poor. It's the subtle things they dont do like introducing yourself when waiting a table. Perhaps a smile or hi my name is. Nothing. Very stale with an attitude like I don't want to be here. 2 stars just because the sushi is good.,1
My friends and I went for a girlie lunch and had a great time. The food was excellent.it's cinco de mayo so the special was fish tacos and they were awesome. My friends had other dishes and we all agreed that we were in love.it's fabulous supporting a local business and Kitchen 56 did not dissapoint!,2
"Jimena was one of the best servers I've had in quite some time! Hope you get in her section! We had great service and great food at a very reasonable price. I had a fajita skillet dish with steak, shrimp and chicken. My boyfriend had the enchiladas. Both were delicious! Also, if you out order a large margarita, be prepared for a LARGE margarita! Not complaining, it was a delicious surprise!",2
"I came here unexpectedly for my birthday dinner. I was plesantly surprised. We had the table side guacamole, the scallops, Pollo a la Brasa, and the fish tacos. All outstanding! For dessert the brought out bread pudding. It was so flipping yummy I could have bathed in it. Will go back to try everything else.",2
They recently opened up and had a nice energy about the place. And they had plenty of people working the floor and counter. The burger is custom made to your order. The french fries were really good and presented well. They do not rush you so you can sit and chat with your friends for a while. Wishing them success.,2
"This place is okay if you're just looking for something to fill your stomach or if you just want Asian food. As a fan of Korean cuisine, the food here is not even close to authentic Korean food even though the owner is Korean I ordered a bibimbap and it was served in a plastic bowl with plastic utensils. I could just go to Panda Express which is nearby if I want that kind of service.",1
"Friendly staff cannot save this place for f'n up illy coffee. Sure they use the same illy beans my local cafe uses, but the way it's brewed here makes it taste totally weak in comparison. I think it was like 7 for my latte that wasn't strong and didn't have the rich flavor i associate with illy coffee. i'll stick with Coffee Bean when i'm staying at Palazzo.",1
"Yummy, yummy, yummy, nChicken Jerk in my tummy, nGoat Curry is in it too. nThe Brown Stew Chicken was nReally finger lickin' nThe Oxtail was tender all through. nChicken Patty turnover was nA very good choice, nRed Velvet Cake so delicious and moist, nSweet potato pie was fruity and sweet nGlad I got to Chander to revisit this treat! Hot Pot 4 18 09 Sat. ",2
"As an city dweller, who has been going to Switch for over a year, I'm sorry to say, I'm NOT going back. Two back to back horrible customer service experiences do not make up for a great atmosphere or good food. Wait staff was rude and unfriendly, which doesn't make any sense for a downtown bar. Boo to that!",1
"Ok so they were out of the kinda Bread I wanted, then the young lady told me no one eats that typ of bread any way. I asked for black olives on my salad and the same young lady, makes a comment about how ucckky that looks and she can't seem look at black olives on a salad. Today your out of Tuna, the next time your out of cheese, next week the soda is out. Come On! One let down after another.!",1
Usual pub fare.nothing special here. I had the fish and chips and was rather disappointed more batter than fish. French fries were no better than the frozen kind that you heat in the oven. My friend had the chicken Caesar salad and she said it was ok . Won't be bothering to return oext visit to Montreal,1
"OH MY GOSH! This place is terrible, I've never ever had a hang nail, and I've been getting my toes does for years, my normal salon was booked, and this one was close to my house so I gave it a try. WORST PLACE EVER! I had a hang nail in both big toes and not to mention she cut to low. She was rude. DON'T GO HERE!",1
"Read some of the reviews on here and thought I'd check it out. Small, cozy place rather inviting. The food was very American a lot of deep fried and heavy butter dishes. Edamame was soggy, squid salad was deep fried and everything else was average at best. The service was good and everyone was very nice. I won't go back. If you like American ized sushi, you might like it and it's very inexpensive.",1
"The wait staff is lovely. I wish the same could be said for breakfast. We only went to this, and then because it was free. I would not encourage anyone to pay for it. We always joke. Who can screw up eggs? TI, that's who. Runny wet scrambled eggs two mornings in a row. On a good note, the zucchini bread was yummy. Fruit was good. Hot things. Not so much.",1
I just moved here from Tucson and was in desperate need of new contacts glasses. I saw the great Yelp reviews for Surprise Eye care so I thought I'd give them a try. I was very pleased with the professionalism and the attention to detail I received from Dr. Ornstein and his staff. He is my new eye Dr. for sure!,2
"Would have been a 5 star but they were temporarily out of my favorite beer. We've been in twice now and each time the food, atmosphere and staff Amie behind the bar is super friendly and helpful were great! Amie suggested the sandwich with yummy pears in it, loved it! Happy hour specials made me, well, happy. Can't wait to return. nPeggy W.",2
"Very big casino. Clean rooms. Moderately priced. Location is OK. It's on an extreme end of the strip. Takes about 12 minutes to walk to Belagio, Ceasar's etc. 1 mile away. The theme is NY city so there are a ton of little deli's and chinese restaurants and pizza stands etc. Cool place. However, they had no problem taking my money at the dice table at 4 AM on my way back in from the bar.",2
"CASINO ONLY review Have not stayed here, but my friend likes the casino here. And, after playing some blackjack and doubling my money here, I can say that I'm a fan, too. It's a bit less chaotic here than, say, the neighboring Venetian. A good vibe without being sleepy. Low key, fun, and enjoyable. I'd be curious to come back and investigate more. And, hopefully, win again!",2
"Aw man, this place is all under new management and stuff. The actual space looks way better since they remodeled, but the menu has jumped in price, but fallen in quality and quantity, and for some reason, the dirty chai was not as good as I remember it being. Also, they stopped making their own muffins. Now they have those huge, come in a pack of 25 ones from Costco, and overcharge for them.",1
I am extremely picky about my creme brulee. I make my own and go all out when I do. I'm talking buyin vanilla beans. Fresh eggs. The whole 9. Torched Goodness is FANTASTIC. I had the cappuccino on the recommendation of owner and couldn't have been happier. What a welcome addition to the Phoenix food scene.,2
"This place is a very solid four. Our service was exceptional. The salsa bar is great. It's hard not to give it five stars since it's so affordable, but the food won't wow you. When was the last time you would seriously give the food at a Mexican restaurant five stars? You can't go wrong at this place. The value in unbeatable for this area of North Scottsdale.",2
"The worse avocado smoothly ever. It doesn't taste avocado, I don't know what they mix but I drink this almost every day but today i stop by this Bambu dessert, I'm from San Francisco it is the worse dessert. I'm craving for avocado and it Tastes so bad. and my husband has Che Ba Mau, it is also bad.",1
"Food was good. Beer choices are plentiful and many are 3 pints on Wednesday. Service is poor. They don't know that there should be a delay between the appetizer and the entree. Lots of tv's, but they also play blaring music. Big hangout for after work groups, couples double dates, and older single guys.",1
"I came here with a friend after seeing the write up in the Arizona Republic and boy was she getting a lot of foot traffic! This is a great little boutique with a lot of cute, casual clothes all on the afordable side and she also has tons of accessories. We will definitely be putting her shop on our rotation!",2
"So i will soon be moving to the east part of town, so i am learning the stores that will be close by. This Safeway is a good one. Clean , neat, and orderly! Lots of parking in the lot. Baskets are abundant which is a good thing. I could quickly find everything i needed this day and love the bakery with all its lovely goodies. I will be back!",2
I stopped going to this Einsteins awhile ago but when I was hungry walking by it the other day I just stopped thinking I would give it another chance. Boy I was wrong. Same old Einsteins I always new. The service was terrible and they rushed everything. Next time I need to remember to stay clear of this place and hit up another Einsteins,1
"What the hell happen? I loved this place the first time, now service is slow, the dinning area looked like a school lunchroom mess, and my sandwich almost had some meat on it. What a disappointment in consistency. Not sure I'll be back, but sure glad I got a phone survey on the receipt. Hopefully an a reaming on the review will do some good.",1
"I'd almost give this one half star more. It is really good food. Cool atmosphere. but the food was not the best I ever had, so it gets 4 starts. Had the love me tenderloin sandwich. very good. the curry sauce for the sweet potato fries was a nice change. They have complimentary valet here. not sure they need valet or not, but it is an added expense. The meal wasn't too overpriced.",2
"Absolutely amazing! Have been looking for a taco shop like this for some time since I moved to the PHX area. I must say I finally hit the jackpot. Cabeza, tripas, pastor, carne asada, ceviche, etc.it's all fantastic so far. They even do red munudo on the weekends for that lovely hangover . I HIGHLY recomment this to anyone who appreciates real mexican tacos.",2
"So, I never write reviews, but I had to. Avoid this restaurant! The food was bland and just not good. I've had better take out Chinese food. Checked in to get the free egg rolls. They were extremely oily and not tasty. Again, avoid this restaurant. It's not worth your money let alone your time. nOh, I agree with the other reviews. The service is lukewarm.",1
"Had a layover here recently coming in from an international destination. Customs wasn't too bad, basically waved us through. But we had to exit to the main terminal and re go thru security, which is freaking insane! We had an 80 minute lay over and I think we only got to the plane with 20 minutes to spare they were already boarding. ugh!",1
"Decent Subway location. everything is there that you would expect no surprises here. The nice thing about this location is the ample parking, well kept inside, and friendly sandwich artists. I did notice that the fresh cookie cabinet was fully stocked. I think some other Subway locations around the area have smaller less diverse selection of cookies.",2
"Appetizer was ok, I got one of the dumplings they had on the menu. I had a shrimp entree that was decent, I think it was the szechuan shrimp. But I also tried the Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles and Seafood. It was the worst dish I've ever had at a chinese restaurant. We couldn't eat it. Just don't order that and maybe you'll be ok. Like I said, the szechuan shrimp was ok.",1
"OMG this place is so bad! I would never ever be back ever again. Obviously, this restaurant was not my choice, but we decided to go since our driver suggested we check out this place. The food was really 2.5 stars, but boy.the service was horrid! We waited forever to be seated when there were many open seats, and the service was SOOOOOOOOO SLOW. Again, i would never be back.",1
"Perks Casino is connected to Excalibur so you can enjoy window shopping indoors between casinos. Nice exhibits. Provided coupons for complimentary stuff. Downfalls Elevators are far from rooms, elevator rides can make you sick, casino is open, does not offer a lot of shops within Luxor, our room only had a shower no tub, towels smelled burnt, toilet does not flush good. Oh, and wi fi not so great.",1
This place is fantastic especially for large gatherings like Birthdays or get togethers. The waiters and waitress are very swift and make sure you have the best possible experience. I recommend going for Dinner here because the ambiance is absolutely breath taking. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants so far.,2
"Siracha wings, gorganzola.truffle oil fries, and two custom creation burgers were all very good. Couldn't resist trying the banana ketchup w jerk seasoning banana peppers lettuce tomato red onion on brioche bun. Terrific taste cooked perfectly med rare. Great little place. Will be back 2 try something else.",2
"You realize that this is a glorified Cheesecake Factory don't you? Actually, I like CF better for some reason. We came here for brunch and our server was rushed and to the point. It was hard to get a hold of her for the majorty of our meal. I had a BLT and the bacon was really thick but overcooked. I could get the waitress to fix it. I'm glad that at least my friends enjoyed their meals.",1
Stayed here for 3 days and the stay was decent. Check in was slow because there was only 1 person working. The hallway was really dark and creepy. Finding the parking lot and valet was really confusing because we had to go around the building. I like the complimentary coffee but it comes with a resort fee of 15. The older valet worker was funny and helpful! He makes the place welcoming.,1
"Terrible. I went half an hour before they were supposed to close. I pulled up and pushed the button. Someone came on and rudely said ""we're closed! "" So I said, ""oh, what time do you guys close? "" And he never answered. They had just brought out food to the car next to me but wouldn't serve me. I will not be returning to this location.",1
"I LOVE the brushes they sell here! They are of very high quality and are very reasonably priced. They go from as little as half what you'd pay to nearly what you would pay for a MAC or Bobbie Brown brush. The bristles never fall out, you can wash them and they are like new again. These brushes are truly an amazing find.",2
"We want to thank you for the great massage we had today. The massage my wife and I had was very profesional and both ladies were great! My wife said ""Susan did not miss any spot "" and I was greatfull to have those excellent strong hands from Anna. We were very pleased and would come back every time we are in Las Vegas. Thank you both!",2
"Thought I would give the Hula another try. Had the pork sandwich with coleslaw. Short story is the pork was tough as leather and hard to chew. The Mai Tai was a little on the lite side and tart side as well. The server was nice, but after the food was delivered to the table, he disappeared. Can't say that Hula will be a return visit, but who knows.",1
"This place is amazing. Everything we had from alcohol n apps to desert was tender, fresh, and delicious! I had the 16, we all shared the combination appetizer, and had baklava and the Persian pastry . So good! The chicken and baklava were my two favorites but it was all really good. I will be back for sure. Great service, great atmosphere, and great food!",2
This is a pretty organized airport. I never seem to have difficulty finding my terminal. Once you understand the general layout of the airport its easy to get around. They have cell phone lots that announce when an airplane has landed which makes it so much easier when you are waiting to pick someone up.,2
"We come here almost every Thursday night for Jokes with Friends comedy show. I will have to say that the food has come a long way from when they first opened. I really like the Buffalo Chicken Flat bread, the Southwestern Chicken Salad and their burgers the best! The nachos are good I prefer the chicken over the ground beef any day.",2
"As most have already reviewed the service from JPG was great and I would highly recommend using them for home security. Not only was the price competitive and maybe lower than others , but the professionalism from Jim owner and Vince installer was more than I would have expected. I would not hesitate to refer JPG to friends and family.",2
"Save yourself the headache and frustration from this incompetent, disorganized and unprofessional business. It has been more than six weeks and we have yet to hear from them. We have repeatedly asked to speak with the owners and each time they would tell us a different name. nWe had to use a bed sheet to cover up our windows because they unable to finish the job. WORSE COMPANY IN NV.",1
"I had an awesome experience with a full body wax! They're professional, quick totally worth every penny. I highly recommend this if you're in Vegas on vaca and were dumb enough not to be groomed already! These ladies gave me an amazing wax and then gave me a special birthday present by reducing the cost! Thanks lovely ladies!",2
"Im not sure how this place has gotten so many great reviews. I ordered the Brie Crepe and had a hard time even finishing it. It states it had carmelized onions but they were more on the raw side. The chicken was not fresh, tasted more like it was processed. The service was just ok also. They need to hire more help.",1
"I had breakfast at the buffet, which was 20 with a Total Rewards card. The food was o.k. Eggs were lousy. Bacon wasn't great. There were a fair number of options, but it was all very mediocre. The service however clearing tables, filling drinks was very good. If you can spend comp points or just don't want to leave I guess this buffet is fine. However, there are lots of better choices in Vegas.",1
"We tried Spago for our last lunch before heading to the airport. There were lots of good options. I really enjoy the Wolfgang Puck restaurant in the casino at MGM Grand, and this has some similar menu items. Our server was very friendly and seemed to really care that we had a good experience. I had the hot wing lollipops and a salad and both were good. Pricing was ""Vegas reasonable "".",2
Maybe its me but I dont like paying 17 for two 12 oz cans of beer just to listen to some 20's something cookie cutter rock band belt out about angst in the 21st century. Why do Casinos need to rape people for drinks? Wont be back there for pool side music unless they get their act together with respect to quality of music venues and sane drink pricing again.,1
A terrible company. Went to get business cards for my new small business.talked to Travis the graphic designer about what I wanted and he seemed like he was happy to help but now a month later and after multiple calls I have heard no response.should change their name from Never Late to Never Received,1
"Waffle House at this location is as good as it gets ! Great food. Fun staff. Weird clientele. However, we are all there for one thing and that is to eat great food at a great price. My favorite meal is the two pork chops and eggs which includes hasbrowns and toast all for about 7. Its a cool place to hang out as well. Their dessert pies are super cheap too. 1.50 are you kidding me ?",2
"Great location right off the lake with indoor outdoor seating, family friendly Weds are family night , great Mexican food yes, its greasy with about 10 dinner combos which can please just about anyone, AND we get a buy one get one free through the mail almost weekly that it just makes sense to keep coming back for more! Plus their chips, salsa, and bean dip just about seal the deal for me! Yummy!",2
"In the past year we have tried Venues 2 times. First time seated indoors after waiting 10 minutes with no service we left. nThought we would try again but to no avail. Same bad attitude, rude waitstaff no drink order. After 5 minutes and the place empty we left again. There are better choices minutes away. Try them instead.",1
"Wish I could give a NO STAR rating ! I came here a year back and the food was pretty good, so I decided to take my friends here. I was highly disappointed by the quality of food ! The Gulab Jamuns seemed like stones, the chicken tasted like it was cooked a year ago ! To sum it up, one of the worst buffets i've been to in a while",1
"I like coming here since it's close to school. My boyfriend and I came here for late lunch and out waitress was rushing me. I'm a server myself and you DONT rush customers. The hibachi is mediocre. It's cheap and I can tell it's premade. I don't know, that's just me. You will see me here but not as often. Maybe once in a blue moon. ",1
Ate here for dinner ordered Thai egg roll the calamari and pad kee mow . Egg roll and squid awesome ordered the pad kea mow at a 3 but came at a 8 easy too hot called the owner over and tried to explain and he started to yell at me grabbed my plate and in front of a crowd to me to get the F out of there. I will go to the corner Thai kitchen at trop. And tee pee.,1
After our horrible experience at Santa Fe Hotel we came here. Judy at the front desk is the nicest person. She made us feel so welcome and gave us a nice room. We were so pleased in how super clean this place is. Our room immaculate. After having a nice dinner out we came back to fresh baked cookies and delicious hot coffee. If I come to this part of Vegas again I am definitely staying here.,2
I had the Southwest Cobb Salad again. It was just delicious. My only suggestion is to have them mix the ingredients. I am sure the presentation would not be as nice but I think it would be easier to eat. I had it mixed today. I prefer it unmixed. I am sure it is psychological but it tastes better without mixing it together.,2
"this is the neighborhood theater, super easy convenient location! nthe prices are a little high, but i guess that's the way things go. one positive thing is the loyalty cup where its only 1.50 for a refill. awesome. nthe seats are pretty comfortable in the theater, and always clean. no funky smells.",2
"Very cool place.and concept. I loved that I could play digital Connect Four at the bar while eating and drinking! It's not cheap by any means, but considering how big the rolls and sashimi is.it's well worth it. What we ate there would have cost 200 in NYC so I considerate it a deal. Downside very packed and some of the staff were snobby. Upside The food outweighed the snobby staff.haha",2
"The ambience at Tryst is great. However, my husband and I have been to Tryst 4 or 5 times. The first time it was great but it has gone down hill since then. Too much chatter between the staff when owners aren't there. And today we waited at least 8 minutes before I flagged down the hostess for our waitress. We eat out frequently and always give places a 2nd or 3rd try but we've had enough.",1
I agree with everything the previous review said. This place is as authentic as it gets on this side of the border. My regular order is two tacos al pastor and a manzanita. The people here are friendly and helpful. They used to be open until 3am on the weekends but I think that has changed. They also operate a food truck on McDowell between 24th and 32nd Street on the North side of McDowell.,2
I love Basil. I think it has the best taste of thai food in this town. Yes its always crowded and pretty much overpriced but if you are ieed of a good pad thai this is the place! besides is awesomely located Not recommended for a big group since this restaurant is not very big and it also has a complimentary valet after 6pm,2
"It is kinda hard for me to find a restaurant that makes their pasta from scratch. But here at Spago, they do just that. There's this pasta dish I forgot what it's called with clam and a bed of spinach with a butter lemon sauce that I had to have whenever I visit Las Vegas. I also like the steamed mussels with chorizo sausage that they have.",2
".I'm generally a Walmart supporter, but this location was a test of my peopleofwalmart.com identification skills. Terrible layout, small and cramped, and far too few lanes open to accommodate 1 2 of the people in attendance. Convenient to one of my two offices it will suffice, but future stops will be few and far between.",1
Great selection of traditional and creative new dishes for breakfast. Service was fast and friendly. We sat down ordered and had our food within 5 minutes. I ordered the Kay special it was super cheesy and tasty along with their seasoned fries. My friend had the stuffed French toast which according To her was amazing!,2
"Excellent experience. I got a great manicure and pedicure there last week. The staff is really friendly, the treatment is much more involved than most massages were excellent and lasted at least 5 minutes more than at other places and the whole thing was 30. The quality was great, my nails still look amazing.",2
"What do you get when you mix a ton of big screen tv's with sports, beautiful women, great and ice cold beer? Twin Peaks honestly i've been to so many sports bars and beer bars and for me what sets the place apart is great service, great spirit and great food and if that isn't enough the beer is always ice ice cold 29 degrees to be exact",2
This place is a fkn dump. Excuse my language. Awful food! From room service to breakfast all the way to their restaurants. I ate for free on every visit. Why? Because I sent it all back! From the awful showers to having no hbo. When i called housekeeping for toothpaste? No sorry sir we don't have that. Umm? Ok. I can just keep going. Worst casino hotel I have ever stayed in. Never ever again,1
Very Unprofessional. Can Can bought the wrong wire for the job without checking what the appliance called for. Then got mad when he found out it called for different wire. He then proceeded to put his tools away and jumped in his truck and drove away without a word. I would caution anyone thinking of using this company.,1
"with all the hype and reviews about this exhibit I was really excited to come see it but I was really disappointed to be honest. I felt like I was reading a textbook. I love history, I love museums, I love medical shows and oddities so I thought this would be exciting to see.its not. Paid 28 with military discount but it was boring and not worth it.",1
"Update went back today for my beloved Passion Tea Lemonade. it took 17 minutes from stepping in line until I finally got my drink. And to make it worse, my tea was luke warm at the bottom if the cup and only cold at top where the ice is. how did they manage to pull that one off? Not shaking it properly? Who knows.",1
"L O V E this place. Has absolutely everything you could want. Quality of clothes is good, lots of guns and ammo and really fun decor. Both my husband and I love it. We could and have spent hours there. A special thank you to Laura who was recently very helpful and certainly understood the benefit of quality customer service. Well done.",2
"Great selection and presentation of fireplaces with friendly services. Services personnel are knowledgeable and offer good tips. Definitely better to look for options for fireplace than Home Depot or Lowes. They offer traditional wood burning, gas, electric, and ecosmart fireplaces the ones often shown on HGTV .",2
"I have never reviewed a gas station before, and I have also never been to a gas station without gas, but this place SUCKS! I am in desperate need of gas, have no where to go to get it, and I pull in to this place only because I saw the cute dinosaur, and low and behold, there was no gas. AVOID AT ALL COSTS, THIS GAS STATION is terrible for it is gas less and the service sucks",1
"Why hasn't this been reviewed yet? This place is THE place for choco addicts. The best, I'm talking major scrumpa lumptious! It's one of my favorite gifts to send. Also good for custom corporate gifts. My fav? This is a hard one.how about my top 4.raspberry swirl, peanut butter, coconut and mint chocolate.",2
"Wow, so I did not end up going to this office because the phone service was terrible. They were so rude and no helpful at all. The receptionist barked at me about my lack of availability for appointment time. They left me on hold for nearly twenty minutes. I caot attest for anything else, but the receptionist has a terrible attitude.",1
Dont go in here the place is crap. They try to trick you into doing an in home they send one of there skanky sales people to upsale you to get a bunch of crap n Poorly ran company owned by an idiot. Not even by la z boy. They are a franchise locally owned by an idiot the inherited the company. Worst place ever. Poor quality. If you want good stuff go to copehaigen much better!,1
"Been here a couple times, ordering something different each time, and all dishes have been delicious. Large restaurant with a bar, cool art on the walls along with some old school posters. My Dad took me here, said it was one of the best older mexican joints here in Vegas. He swears by the menudo here, cant get enough. Full range of dishes to choose from and the horchata is on tap!",2
"This is my first time to Culver's and boy, I enjoyed the burger. I took the Culver's Bacon Deluxe with fries and a strawberry shake. The bun was toasted to perfection and the meat was cooked exactly to my taste. The fries and shake were excellent too. Overall, it is a wonderful place to get a quick meal. All thanks to my gf for taking me here. I will keep visiting this place.",2
"So in love with Lux! Trendy doesn't quit cover it. People watching is priceless. Chill environment. Great, food coffee and wine. Mac and cheese with jalapenos and bacon is unreal! Sport football, basketball, ect. in the back room on a huge screen entertains my son and boyfriend so I can get some chill time in. Staff is so friendly and personable. Thoroughly impressed!",2
"Ok It might be a bit expensive But they do have some great beers from around the world. And I tried one of their Flammekueche and I have to say that it was just great and a decent size too. For 20 you can get a beer tasting of 6 different brews and that's worth it ! Lots of Tvs to watch the games during the world cup or some popular sports events, great service and. Well that's already a lot.",2
"Well at a tech conference occasionally you're allowed to indulge more so if you're sitting with analysts and important blog writers. I didn't because I had already eaten dinner. However I did order the pumpkin soup and it was fantastic, but be warned it is actually a bit spicy. Which is nice, if you're into that sort of thing.",2
"I can't believe that others give this place a ONE for stars. I have been here several times and It is real good. The food is always consistant. I like the Animal Burrito along with the tacos. The place is clean and the ingredients are fresh. It is your basic Mexican restaurant with what you would expect. PS the Korean place next door, Yum Yum BBQ is a great Korean place.",2
"I'm updating my review The last three times I ate at this place, it was pretty poor. The sashimi was chewy, fishy, and just all around gross. I got teriyaki chicken and the chicken appeared to have been microwaved. I'm disappointed since this place is soooo close to my house. Alas, I must find another place. Booo!",1
"I wish I could own a franchise of Portillos! Seriously. My Dad went to the original location growing up, and it's my boyfriend's favorite restaurant he is also from Chicago . Their food is perfect, the customer service is second to none, and their training is what makes it all happen. I love you so much, Portillos!",2
"Sometimes when I meet my friends that work across town for lunch, this is where I go. The layout of this place seems to make more sense than other stores further west of this location. The people here are super, super friendly and they make it kind of fun to order your food. The ingredients do seem a bit more fresh than other Subways I go to as well. Can't go wrong with this place!",2
You get what you pay for. It was good for a spur of the moment trip and a place to sleep but it didn't give me the true Vegas experience. I was in college so I wish I had more money to spend on a nice hotel and good food. But again it was good for a place to sleep and that's it. Elevators oh my god so slow!,1
"I usually give fast food employees the benefit of the doubt, maybe in part because I've worked in fast food before, but the service at this location is exceptionally bad as far as how long it takes the employees to get me my food when I'm the only one waiting there for anything. I always seem to be standing around for a good 10 minutes while they don't quite do their jobs. I won't go back.",1
"Still one of the best breakfast spots in town in my humble opinion. Steve the manager, the whole staff today we had April and she was still top notch are all truly delightful people. There isn't much new to report other than you need to try this place out if you haven't yet. You will love the cozy atmosphere, great food and super friendly staff.",2
I love synchronized swimming and physically stunning shows like ballet or bullfighting but I was bored and trying to think of excuses to leave the venue not even half way through the show the novelty of the water aspect of the show wears off very quickly and then you're left with the lame music and shmaltzy plotline. sigh to think that we wasted 300 on tickets makes me sad.,1
"Had breakfast buffet at TI over the Christmas holiday. Had been there a few times previously three years ago when we got married in Vegas. Those times we good. This time, it was bad. Not much in variety at the stations. No simple muffins or pastries. Quality of the food was poor. The breakfast at the Mirage was much better and a dollar cheaper.",1
"Located in the heart of Vegas, the hotel is nice and access to shopping stores within the resort makes it very convenient. The downside is that parking lot is far from the hotel. If you don't mind walking a distance, this is great place to rest and have fun. As for the slot machines, I find that other casinos have more variety.",2
"French fries, good. Veggie burger, horrible. I live in L.A. do we just know how to make a veggie burger and the rest of the country doesn't? Take it off the menu then! It's a decent looking place, apparently the highest grossing restaurant in the country from what I hear. Very loud, so if you want to come here to eat and then dance it's a decent spot. Just not to talk.",1
"Came here with my family once and both my mom and I got food poisoning from eating here. Not only that but I got it after eating a lasagna at a supposedly ""nice "" Italian restaurant in the hotel that we had to wait an hour to get into. Thanks for the worse Vegas trip ever, at least the day I got sick and starting yacking everywhere was the day we left ",1
Not really much to say other than the convenience of a Wendy's in the airport which is nice if you are in the mood for a burger and a Frosty. The only problem was airport prices! The cheapest combo if I remember correctly was 8. I got a chicken sandwich combo and a small frosty and my bill was 13. Really sad! I just don't understand the need to gouge the consumer for convenience.,1
"The service was not awesome. My falafel was mediocre. The pita was kind of cold. There was way too much lettuce on it, and the lettuce was also sliced way too big to be practical. My friend had a veggie burger with cheese, they put 1 square inch of cheese on it what? And, it came on burnt toast? Hm. I will not be back any time soon. What a disappointment.",1
I like coming here for breakfast before classes. They have wifi and their environment is very workable! I like getting their bagels and orange juice. The oj is always freshly squeezed and it tastes so authentic and different from store bought cartons. The bagel chips are so addicting and pretty cheap.,2
This place is amazing! The cake is to die for and so good. We had are wedding cake from here and they even made it it 24 hours after our cake disaster on the drive up! The staff were amazing and the cake was ready for our special day! All the cake is good and tiramisu was great! This place is a must!,2
"I went to this place for my 24th birthday. Overall I was happy, it was nice and clean and our waiter was really nice and attentive. The food was very reasonable in price, and they had some decent items to choose from. However, I didn't get a chance to get any dessert which was the real reason why I went. I will definitely go back again.",2
"The ambiance in this restaurant was on par with other Vegas restaurants. The service was good. I ordered the lamb chops as an entree 47 . The portion was miniscule, and came with 2 tiny potatoes. This size is more in line with an appetizer. For the price, I have had way better, and cannot recommend this restaurant.",1
"This locations Service Department pretty much sucks. Rob always gave great service and he's gone now. nI've purchased all my vehicles from Carmax in the past 10 years but don't care much for this location. Hey management you might want to take a look at these reviews, especially on service. Not so good.",1
"Been my vet for 12 years, caring and professional. Doc Baumler and the crew are top shelf. Recently had another positive experience as my elder dog developed an infection and was very bad off. Doc B correctly diagnosed a difficult case, and prescribed the right stuff to get him back on track. In addition, he's called several times to make sure everything is OK.",2
"It was ok, but not really worth going to considering all of the better Asian Sushi restaurants in the area. Our server also smelled HEAVILY of cigarette smoke not exactly and appetizing scent. The sushi was ok, as was the seaweed salad. The Pad Thai though was not very good. Honestly, this is a place you are safe skipping out on!",1
"No substitutions allowed for anything. I don't eat pork and wasn't allowed to sub for anything. Then I asked for gravy and the waitress said they don't have any. No gravy at a breakfast joint? Then the service wasn't good either. I pretty much sat most of the time waiting to get silverware, or syrup. Won't go back.",1
Terrible. I came home to an area of my bathtub's finish scrubbed off a 3x5 inch area! It is going to cost me over 300 to have the tub refinished. The company didn't even give me a full refund on the cleaning service. What a terrible and untrustworthy business. nI'll post a photo of the damage so you can see what badness you're choosing if you try this company. nSo very awful.,1
"We usually don't visit commercialized restaurants but after a morning of shopping we stooped in today for the soup, salad and bread sticks. The waiter Cory Q. was awesome! He was on top of everything. The restaurant was clean and the soup was really good. Great price for what all we got. Good job Olive Garden!",2
"When we first went here about a year ago, the food was good, decent portions, ok service. Over the next few months, it all went downhill. The restaurant got dirty, as mentioned by other reviewers, the waitstaff got a bad attitude, and the food was no longer very good.small portions, burnt or undercooked. So we haven't been back in about 4 months and will not go back again.",1
"Del Taco? Get the fuck outta here. nTaco Bell? No way in hell. Hands down the best fast food Mexican restaurant on the face of the planet. The stuffed quesadillas are out of this world delicious. The Chicken Tacos al Carbon quite the tasty street taco. I can only assume the other stuff they sell is excellent too. Red salsa is ok, but the green salsa is where its at. Happy feasting.",2
"Completely and totally delicious intoxicatioot necessary, haha! . Both slices I had were a bit on the salty side just the way I like it , and man that white pizza especially was just divine. Quick service, friendly employees, just a really great spot. Shout out to the girl in the elevator that told me how to get there or else I might have never found it!",2
"For being a chain restaurant, CB is pretty awesome. I love the variety in their menu sometimes I stare at it, unable to decide . And for someone who isn't a good cook me! , it's nice to go out for an affordable, home cooked meal. I love the country store attached to the restaurant. Fun to browse, and I've found some great birthday holiday gifts there, too!",2
"Wasn't to happy with the cleanliness of this location. The floor needed mopping and had a lot of flies. Wanted to give the kids apples with their kids meal, however they only had enough for one? I ordered a chicken salad, and they were out of the salad dressing that comes with the salad. nNoticed a lot of transient traffic at this location. We all still ate, and it was fine.",1
"Went here for lunch with my husband and two friends today. The restaurant is beautiful and the setting of the resort is spectacular. The food and wine list were very good, but our server was not impressive. He was slow to take our order and not all that helpful. The entree portions were large, but the desserts were tiny, but good! Overall, a very nice place though!",2
Cute cafe for quick bite. Don't set expectations high. Quality of food is similar to microwaveable and or vending machine food. Prices are average being located at Wynn. Bagel with cream cheese and a toasted microwaved breakfast bagel pre made 2 small coffees and a half cup of fruit 25. Stop by if drunk and hungry no where else to go during late hours.,1
"My husband ate a burger here on Saturday evening, November 16, 2013 and subsequently became sick with gastroenteritis a few hours later. We are wondering if anyone else has had this experience around this date and time. Please be careful what you eat and please if you work somewhere handling food, wash your hands regularly.",1
"Can't belive how rude the employees are here! I work down the street and have stopped in once before and today gave them another chance and will not be going back, EVER! The employees are ridicoulsly rude, they don't greet you, they hand out the food with out even looking at you and for sure won't thank you for your business. How much longer is the disctric region manager going to let this go on?",1
"Great atmosphere and even better food. Order bruschetta obviously and make sure you get at least one prosciutto and fig in your flight! The Italian Picnic salad is amazing goat cheese. bacon. I mean what more could you want?! The only downside is you're almost forced to use valet parking. Pretty annoying but hey, what can you do? Carry a couple bucks on you for the valet.",2
We love the Farmhouse so we decided to try the Gilbert House. It is a very cute place and we had great service and food. The kids meals are plenty of food still even for our 10 year old. It was a bit hot in the back room we were in so recommend sitting on the patio if the weather is nice. Will return there again!,2
Omg. We went there yesterday 8 pm. Nobody was there. We were the only guests there. nPrices were unbelievable expensive. 44 scallops n88 Filet mig. nWe ate teppanyaki. Chicken steak were tastless. nWaitress was very friendly. Cook As well. nWould Never ever go there again. nIts old ugly dirty Restaurant. nBenihana is always an Experience. Hamada was a joke. nPlease Close this restaurant.,1
Average Fatburger on the Vegas Strip. The only thing I liked was the outdoor patio that looked out to the strip and the space heaters to keep us toasty during the winter months. I'm not a fan of the service though. It seemed like the waitress was bitching at all her customers and basically encouraging them to leave. I'd come back for food or drinks but hopefully on a day that service is better.,1
"Nice atmospher, good beer selection. Had an appitizer, the scotch eggs, and then fish and chips for lunch. Both were very good and i would recommend. Seated quickly. Waitress must of been having a bad day, short and not very informative. Our group of nine was pleased with food, displeased with waitress demeanor.",2
"From the outside it looked like a good place to cowboy food. Turned out to the the worst bar food ever. My boyfriend ate the Chicken Parmesan and it made him very stomach sick. nMy patty melt tasted like a sponge soaked in clarified butter. The burger had no flavor and the grilled onions were mush. Add to the experience, a waitress who did not care.",1
"Worst Walmart ever! I drive the extra miles to go to another walmar just so I dont have to be stuck at this one! Checkers are SLOW, so the lines are SLOW. There is NEVER more than 4 lines open at once, so naturally the lines are LONG! More than a few times I have gotten so irritated that I left my cart in line and left. Hate this Walmart!",1
I first went here on a Groupon and now come on a weekly basis. My girl does such a great job on my mink lashes and I always get compliments! I couldn't ask for a better professional and very nice staff. I'm always looking ready to go out because of this wonderful business. LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM! You will get hooked too ,2
Pride is just a time to get drunk and hang out with friends. It would be a waist of time and money if you went alone. I own a gblt pet business so it may be good for advertising one year. I mean pride is for glbt people so its nice to have a place to all hang out for a weekend. It's nothing big. The parade is a different story! I would definitely recommend that!,1
This place is junk. I generally like Mandalay bay but a huge disappointment. I'm writing this hoping the management sees this. Here watching football on a Sunday. Sub par service. Have to chase waitress down. Moscow mule. Terrible! And the TV situation is WEAK! Really a multimillion dollar resort. Get your act together. Lots of places to spend my money besides this hotel.,1
"Service Sucks with rude and uncaring bartenders. No table service and the only intellegence they have is their beer on tap names, wow. Its a business operated poorly with no respect for customers. I wouldnt come back here even if Windy, jazz soul singer, performs here again. Absurd, how do they stay in business?",1
"I am blown away! I loved Searsucker . . . but I have to admit that I thought it was a bad location from the very beginning. But, of course, no one asked me . . . so I kept my mouth shut . . . well, except when I was enjoying a Peter Rabbit no ice please! . My fingers are crossed that Brian will reopen in a much better location in Scottsdale. Please, please, please.",2
"I was disappointed on my experience. Great concepts but the burger had no seasoning, the bun was cold. My wife asked for no sauce and the added sauce, but then only to take off the bacon and add cheese over the top of there mistakes. They put cold onions and cold bacon back on my wife's burger. nThe fried zucchini was not very good see photo. nWe were disappointed",1
"This is my favourite resort to stay in phoenix. it is a bit pricey, but you pay for the wonderful views, excellent pool and relaxing atmosphere. I used to visit here when it was owned by another company, but the name is still the same. Quite a few professional atheltes have also stayed when I have visited. Do rent a car if you plan to leave the resort, but why?. you have everything you need D",2
"In a city full of great breakfast places, the Egg I is definitely one of them. Seriously, though, it's very good. And relatively cheap. Very unpretentious. And the banana nut muffins are amazing. Our server, Amanda, was the best! Very friendly and attentive and never once rushed us even though we took our sweet time. If you can make it off the strip, this place is definitely worth it.",2
"While I love Sallys, this store is the worst! Twice now I've gone in and had the most awful customer service ever! Both ladies were extremely rude, unhelpful, and acted as if their time was being wasted answering questions or checking anyone out! I definitely won't be going back to this particular store.",1
"Don't waste your time! So many good restaurants in Las Vegas and this is NOT one of them. Service was slow and the food looked good on the menu but tasted seriously bland. The portions were very small, like a child's plate. Our party of 6 were all disappointed. Sad, because we were trying to celebrate a birthday and this restaurant didn't deliver If I knew how to give a minus rating I would.",1
"My boyfriend and I visited Pittsburgh for a wedding and visited Mad Mex on a friends recommendation. It was fantastic! You must have a mango margarita! Delicious. And half off during happy hour. If you're going to eat anything there, try the nachos. Delicious to split and you don't need to order an entree. The nachos are huge. Will definitely recommend Mad Mex to anyone visiting Pittsburgh.",2
"This place is unclean, has poor service, and pricey vs other like type restaurants. I ordered the half chicken and rice 32 . It came with 2 drumsticks. WTF? This place is tanking and it's easy to see why after eating here numerous other reviews say the same thing. I'd look for t nOther places to eat.",1
"I was just passing through on a connection. Its a big airport with lots of different options. Somewhat chaotic, but that is airline travel these days. There were many different food options, all of which looked pretty good. Only had time to grab something quick auntie annies, i recall , but was happy they had good variety. Gate areas can be a bit cramped.",2
"I want to say it's good Ice cream.really good ice cream.It's definitely not gelato. nWhile cruising through the Venetian.my girlfriend and I thought it'd be perfect to stop take in the hotel and the ambiance and enjoy some ""gelato "". We both opted for the Coconut and really enjoyed it.we sat for a while just enjoying each others company and taking in the scenery.",2
"I feel like I should vomit. I am not a fan of buffets, especially cheap ones. I unfortunately am stranded at the fiesta and needed dinner. I read the reviews and the Mongolian grill sounded doable, love Mongolian grill elsewhere. Wrong, it's cheap, it's greasy, and not something I enjoyed. If you want an excellent buffet go to the strip, preferably wicked spoon.",1
"This place is cool. Super friendly they are really trying to grow the craft beer community in Charlotte. Lots of great beers and feel free to combine them for more options. With local regulations the only food is from a food truck in the parking lot but they usually have a good truck parked out there. Great spot to meet friends, listen to music or just drink great local beer.",2
We were looking for a cheaper breakfast option on our vacation. Bagelmania was the perfect spot. Its a local place located in a strip mall a few blocks off the strip. It was pretty busy with lots of local regulars. The portions were generous and the food was great. Try the homemade hash and a fresh baked bialy. You won't regret it!,2
"Service is great, atmosphere is great, and food is great! Not a place to go if you are on a budget though. nWe ordered an order of egg rolls 3 and fried wontons 8 as appetizer.For dinner I had Pad Thai. An order of Pad See Eu was split between 3 kids. My kids loved it and the portions are large! nThen for dessert we tried their Red Velvet Cake which is rich and yummy.",2
"This place is a joke, or Yelp is! I drove all the way down from Anthem to eat on a Saturday night cause the yelp has they're hours posted as open till 11pm on Saturdays got there at 10 10 an was fold the kitchen closes at 10 00 on Saturdays. Even if its Yelps fault the management is still at fault for not updating or correcting hours.",1
"Worst pizza in the world! I wouldnt take there pizza for free let alone 30 for it. Much better choices in town. Service is not professional and lacks attention mid week afternoon shifts. The bartender has to serve you because theres no waitstaff on floor. The place is so dead, they dont staff and it effects service.",1
"Simply put, this place cannot compete with the delicious and more affordable food elsewhere. The food is mediocre at best and ridiculously overpriced. To make matters worse, they refused to honor our restaurant.com certificate because it is restaurant week. The wine is good but overpriced and the service is fine, but the entrees seem about 10 dollars overpriced a piece.",1
"The food was delicious! They had really good service. Comparing to the other restaurants I've been to lately, this had the best service. There was really nice entertainment. A man would start singing and some kids came up to dance, which was amazing to see. I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant. Extremely recommended.",2
"I want to give a better review, but unfortunately today's experience was too poor to overlook. Bad experience today. Low inventory, really slow service, their signature breakfast item is the muffins. While I was standing in line they ran out of almost everything and apparently weren't prepared with any new muffins baking. I walked out instead of getting breakfast",1
Dirty. This location is just plain grimy. The floors are filthy the bathrooms are horrendous and the theaters smell. Thankfully the staff is decent. I'd steer clear of this location if you can help it. This is Arcadia I expected more. I feel like this would be a great location if they updated the theaters and work on the sanitary conditions. Dine in movies maybe?,1
"Found this place by accident and loved it! Looks like a little hacienda, friendly staff and, oh yes, the food. I'm a bit of a Mexican food snob having grown in Texas, but the food here is awesome! Love the bean dip, love the fresh salsa, love the guacamole.after all that I only had room for a cheese enchilada plate.that was great. Will be back soon!",2
"Annoying and inconsistent. Came in on a Monday evening to put in a request for my daughters birthday party on Saturday, baker wasn't available so I left all my info to be contacted. Was told that they only needed 2 days notification. Didn't get a call from bakery until Wed. Went back in and put in our request and was told they weren't able to do it. What a waste of time and energy.",1
"What's not to love about this location?!? As the previous reviews have stated they have great instructors, spa like facilities, variety of classes and times and price that makes it seem too good to be true! Martin, Tony, and Liz are awesome instructors! They were some of my favorites when they taught kettlebell, barefoot boot camp and pilates at Vegas Hot.",2
"I had amazing first impressions of this salon, until the owner opened his mouth. Rudest person I have ever met. Treated me like a child instead of a new customer and made me feel stupid for asking questions that many other salons have no problems answering. Bought a single session and never returned. If you cant handle being nice to customers don't work at your own establishment.",1
"Great big salads make your own or choose from a list. Made right in front of you and if you add meat, I think they grill it while you are waiting. Very fresh! nNow with their wine selection, and the way they dim the lights and place candles on the table it makes it a great dinner date place. nThe staff service is very friendly, too.",2
"Roland's was recommended by hotel. Service was terrible. Food was cold. Brick oven pizza cold. Asked to have it reheated , still came back cold. Steak was way over cooked. Never got appetizer we ordered, but was charged for it. Was not busy but waitress was hard to find. Would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone.",1
"Apparently, the staff here is even worse than I thought. I, like several others, have now received extremely abusive and lewd messages from someone who is confirmed to work at Tina's, and by their own account, is part of the management. Unless you care to be treated like trash, called awful names, harassed, and threatened, I suggest you find someplace else to eat.",1
"Odd Happy Hour. Terrible food. The only time in my life I've ever seen a group order chicken wings and not finish them. I mean, that's saying something isn't it? Two stars because they have Guinness on tap and it's a convenient location so I always seem to end up there when I am in Tempe, even though it's not very good. Note to self beer only next time.",1
"28 mins to get served at lunchtime is unacceptable. That's great that they have soup available but maybe that should have been a red flag. The excuse that they make everything fresh doesn't work for me because it doesn't take 28 mins to make a chicken souvlaki platter. Lunch started off good but didn't end well. Please remove the word ""Express "" from your signage.",1
"Coffee, pastries and wifi on par with any cafe in the city first aeropress I've seen in Pittsburgh , but selection of smoothies, protein shakes and blended drinks is incredible. Ingredients ranging from fresh kale and bee pollen to seasonal items like actual pumpkin instead of syrup. Worth seeking out.",2
I have to say this was the worst visit I have ever encountered at Olive Garden. Chicken was dry. Potatos were not cooked correctly. Food came late drinks not served correctly. Come on we ordered tea nothing fancy and serve me flavored tea. I would rather drive to the Cheyenne and Rainbow. Figured this location being newer would have better service and the food prepared terrible.,1
"It's just okay. It's a fun place to dance but I think sometimes the DJs get a little too carried away with DJing. I would like to hear songs not mash ups on your Apple laptop. Is that all takes to be a DJ now? An Apple laptop? Anyways, it's not worth the cover and I think there are a lot of better places to take your ten dollars.",1
"This place is always crowded, noisy and kind of overwhelming. But it is sooo worth it just to come in for one of their delicious agua frescas. They have a stand near the produce section where they will ladle you a huge cup of iced fruit juice. My favorites are the cantaloupe and the watermelon, but they're all good, the perfect thing to take the edge off a hot Phoenix day.",2
"I got to the airport a little under two hours prior to my flight only to learn I couldn't print my boarding pass because they ""weren't open yet "". Then the process to check my bag took longer than going through security because the kiosks were unresponsive and not user friendly. One of my worst airport experiences and I'm not even on the plane yet.",1
"A beautiful wine bar who's atmosphere seems more like your best friends living room than a restaurant. I loved the interior, the decor, the seats, the wine cellar, the secluded location, the wine enthusiasts who apparently also knows how to bartend. It was lovely and quite a surprise to find they had a list of bottles for half off on sunday's. mmm craving wine right about nowwwwwww",2
"Mon petit bonheur hebdomadaire ! Une vraie l u00e9gende ! M u00eame lorsque la fil d'attente va jusqu' u00e0 l'ext u00e9rieur du restaurant, le service est rapide et courtois. La poutine Italienne, faites avec une sauce u00e0 la viande sans tomate, donc pas vraiment italienne, est la meilleure poutine de Montr u00e9al. Sans l'ombre du moindre doute. Rapport qualit u00e9 pirx INCROYABLE",2
"If you are looking to eat any kind of meat here, dont even think about it, all you will get is overcooked meat that is tough and tastes like cardboard. The food was a major fail, however, the only thing that was pleasant was the desserts, crepe station was great! But we did not pay 30 for a dessert buffet. If you want a decent buffet, go to Encore or the Bellagio.",1
"The best pizza place in Las Vegas, hands down. The arugula salad is always amazing for a non pizza choice. nThe Misto is also great with its selection of salumi and cheeses. All of the pizza's Ive had there were delicious, the Settebello and the Carbonara are my faves. Service has been great and just ok but I will keep going back.",2
"Not good ordinary boring, long wait for no reason. I do not understand the good reviews. My omelette was good, no potatoes to be found, the chicken sausage was cold! The only seafood was smoked salmon. How is this worth anywhere close to 25.00! A complete waste of money. Only good thing to say was MaryAnne my server was good.",1
"I love this place. its very comfortable and relaxed. A good place to end your sunday funday after bouncing around to all the noisy bars in the area. Food is good, drinks are great and there are plenty of activities like the off track horse racing and board games. I will be back for the Thursday movie nights starting soon!",2
"Great food, inside atmosphere is just too loud unless you have children which the noise probably won't bother you. ""Banzi Burger "" is killer and the other menu favorite of mine is the ""Chicken Ensanada Platter "" with ranch dressing, both are very filling. Milk shakes are also quite tastey. The loation is on 101 and Mayo so lunch and a movie on the weekend are great hand in hand.",2
"Ugh. The worst fish taco I've ever had. The place itself is nice and comfy and the service was decent, but the food was seriously lacklustre. My dining companions seemed moderately satisfied with their food, but we were ridiculously hungry. The fish tacos were full of freezer burned fish sticks and limp, bagged lettuce. No thank you.",1
What kind of night club denies you entrance on a Thursday when its only you 1 person and want you to get table service when its only yourself specially when you are coming out of state that is freaking pathetic okay specially when they say locals its fine makes no freaking sence lame af! avoid go somewhere else on a Thurs. fix your bouncers or yourself as a club pathetic,1
I have to give Olives a 5 star review for the amazing service and view we had at dinner. We had reservations at 7 on a Tuesday for 5 people. We showed up at 6pm had drinks at the bar and asked for a table outside and that we were willing to wait for it. We had the perfect table outside and were seated right at 7pm. The service was top notch and everyones meal was very good.,2
"A group of six friends made a late reservation for a birthday dinner, we were seated immediately and the magic began! nThe service was spot on the waitress was attentive yet unobtrusive. The food was fantastic especially the duck risotto with orange cream sauce! A must try if you are visiting Montreal especially in the evening, the garden is amazing!",2
"Placed an order for delivery on phone at 6 45 pm. They said it would arrive in approx 45 min. 1 hour later i called them. They stated that it was on the way. Called them again at 8pm, they said so sorry, give you 50 off. Waited untill 8 30, still no food. Called them back again and told them to stuff it. VERY POOR! Would not recommend this joint to anyone. Very, very poor!",1
"This is good chinese food if you're from OTTUMWA, Iowa But im from around Chicago, and i can tell you with that the mandarin cuisine here is is not good. Borderline not edible. Im a restaurant owner and would hate to call anyone's food that, but it is what it is. The prices are reasonbale especially for a casino floor location, but food is bad.",1
This place is my 2nd fav restaurant in LV. There fresh pasta is outta this world. For appetizer I recommend the calamarie HANDS DOWN best calamarie I ever had. Service is very good and there desert menu is good I don't recall the name but I got a cup of chocolate and a few Pastries on the side and you dip it the fresh melted chocolate. If you want good Italian food come here! ,2
"BEST scallops I've ever had in my life, and I'm a very picky San Franciscan when it comes to scallops haha. We arrived early for our reservation and turns out the reservation was lost! We were upset about it, seeing it was my birthday and all, but the chef Alex Stratta himself came out and helped find a table for us. Now that's service!",2
A fairly easy airport to navigate through. The southwest terminal can be super crowded during peak hours and peak seasons but I've enjoyed my time spent here at this particular air port. Another great thing is that the Strip is about 3 miles from here so getting to and from is a relatively cheap cab ride and a short drive if you have a rental car. The food selection here is decent also.,2
"If you are looking for a really bad service experience or like to walk several miles a day getting from your room to the casino and back, this is the ideal place for you. The casino is just ok, the buffet gets a 7. What is spectacular is the night life and the rooms specifically the bathtub shower combo . In general too expensive and a bad experience",1
"This place is AMAZING! I had never had this cuisine before and we tried it on a whim recently it is in our neighborhood and we wanted to try something new . I have been back 5 times in less than 2 months. The food was awesome, the staff is helpful and nice. I like the bar setup also because I can go in during lunchtime by myself and read my book. Love this place!",2
I am planning a wedding in only 7 weeks and had ordered lavender for the wedding. It was my fault that I didn't pay attention on when it was to arrive and never received it. Lee Lee was so kind to me after I made a rush reaction that they never sent it and was willing to send me more. Thank you! I have learned a big lesson and they are to kind in helping me out!,2
"I like this place because it is open 24 hours, you get your food fast even if there's a line , and its a really filling sandwich for 6. I get the veggie sandwich and my hubby gets the tuna melt and adds on a few free veggies lettuce, red onion, roasted red peppers, chipotle sauce , and avocado .99 upcharge . Both are excellent, flavorful sandwiches.",2
"My first experience with Los Tacos was definitley a good one. So good that I will definitely be back. nNot only do they have the best burritos, but the salsa is the best in city. One bite, and i was sold! nA step up from Roberto's would be an understatement, so just do yourself a favor, get down and support Los Tacos.you'll be happy you did.",2
" 8 pp cover starting at 7 pm on a Saturday. 20 minutes until we were even greeted by our server. 12 for a Stoli martini. 100 decibels of loud, though not particularly enthusiastic, piano bar standards. The numbers don't lie, this place is pretty lame. Looking for a sing a long piano bar experience? Head to Tempe where you'll get more 'Bang' for your buck.",1
"Had our End of Season Kickball party on Saturday at Catch 22. Matt the Owner rocked and made it a great night. The servers were awesome and made sure everyone was getting their drinks and food if they ordered any. The live music they had was good and was enjoyable too. Its a great place to watch sports, just drink, or just have fun. I will be back and thanks again for everything!",2
"The worst costumer service I've ever had in my life. I was interested in buying a treadmill,so I tried running on it,and got yelled at. Also I got yelled at for punching a ""punching "" bag. When I wanted to try some shorts on and,I could NOT find one worker! Not one of the workers smiled at me. And when I finally found two workers,they were putting golf! I WILL NOT EVER COME BACK AGAIN!",1
"Dr. Reese delivered expert care to me and my son this week. I came in with a chipped tooth. She counseled me on a couple of options and explained the pros and cons of both. When she had finished repairing my tooth, it was flawless. She treated my son so well while we were there and made him actually want to come back to the dentist! Great experience from a dedicated professional.",2
"We went here at an odd time 3 ish and we were greeted with a smile. Every dish we tried was delicious. Garlic chicken, pepper steak, Szechwan chicken, and beef curry were all distinctly different and excellent. The curry is authentically spicy and full of flavorful ginger, basil, and lemongrass. This place is a treasure.",2
"I stopped in because its close and has great reviews this was my first time with Indian food and it was a good introduction I tried the chicken tikka , palak paneer and garlic naan all very tasty and enough for another meal I will come back and try some other menu items very friendly owner too and they gave me a free dessert too what a happy surprise thank you Nandini",2
"Randomly walked in because we saw it from across the street. Was really good and looking forward to trying the place in the city. The waitress was very friendly and accommodating. I don't remember what we got not but it was all vegetarian and delicious. I even took a card, in case I came back to Montreal! Ha.",2
"Love this place! Can't say enough great things about it. My friends and I had excellent service, drinks, food, and fun! The decor is gorgeous. Can't wait to come back and enjoy their happy hour. The bar looks like a great place to relax and converse with friends. I highly recommend the emerald drink. Yum!",2
"This place was on triple D. One of the best tequila line ups I have seen and their beer selection is off the charts. I got the 4 taco sampler with plantains and chips and salsa. Also got a Mexican coke, in a glass bottle the only way to have a coke . Service was prompt and everyone was nice. It was a Tuesday night and a little slow. There was a live band with a jazz flute. Nice touch.",2
"Would have been five stars for us if they hadn't lost our reservations. Rude never works . To the restaurants credit they were able to accommodate our group of eleven. nThis was the best dinner we had in Vegas and I want to go back. Fresh oysters, fish and chips and my favorite Hangar 1 vodka. nThanks to manager to help us feel welcome nThat's points!",2
I normally goto Archi's.but I just got done shopping at Kohl's and was starving.since I love Thai food.I decided to stop by. I should've kept going or eaten at fuddrucker's. I ordered a 10 and got a 2.the food was under seasoned. Some of the cucumbers were rotten in the cucumber salad. They touched my table 3 times so hence the 2 stars. Thoroughly disappointed. I well not be going back.,1
I am very picky when it comes to who cuts my hair. So I read the reviews about this place on yelp. I decided to give it a try. Let me tell you I was very impressed. Nick did one awesome job on my hair and was very friendly. He squared the back and broke out the straight razor for my neck. All in all it was the best haircut I ever got. Go see the guys here they are awesome,2
Had a car appointment at 3pm. Car still not in the shop at 4. Another lady here dropped off keys at 6am before work and they forgot about her car! All I needed was to switch my batteries! Unreal. This lady has a trip she is suppose to be taking tonight. Not sure that is going to happen. Frustrating!,1
I usually like panda but this one is not one that I will go offten. Mika the girl that rang us out wasn't very pleasant and didn't even smile a smile can make a diffrence. .I work in cust. Service and if u want people to come back u need to let them fill good. And on top the portions are very small they take to long to help people the rather make them wait. So to say the least not a pleasant vist,1
I came here because there was a wait at another pho place down the street. I ordered pho and the broth was good. It did not leave me quenching for water after so that's a good sign. They gave me a heaping amount of meat in my order! And I asked for 2 plates of onions and they happily obliged. Lots of meat onions winner for me. I will be back if I want pho next time I'm in Vegas.,2
"We chose this restaurant because we wanted Indian food and this was the closest to Summerlin. I am happy that we did. Everything was delicious. Garlic nan, Samosa's with tamarind and mint sauces made there , Chicken Curry, tender Lamb in a garlic cream sauce. Loved everything. My only complaint is that it took a long time to get the food out but it was worth it.",2
"I wanted to like this, but was very disappointed. Reservations for 5 45, didn't get seated until 6 15 only after talking twice to the hostess. My Cabernet was served chilled for some reason, service was extremely slow food was just ok. Lobster bisque was good the husbands liked their steaks, but overall presentation flavors were very ""chain like "".",1
"Very, very poor. Oceans grill had little on the menu from the ocean, a selection similar to what you would find in a chain restaurant with a name that starts with ""Red "". Add to that poor service, rude staff, poor presentation and astronomical prices and you have a recipe for disappointment. I would steer clear of this place and buy a fish sandwich from Mickely D's if you need a seafood fix.",1
"THEY REMOVED THE MEZE MENU! The Cheap tapas menu was the best kept secret in town prior to the renovation. Yes, it is now an amazingly beautiful restaurant, but you can't argue with value. Great calamari. Greek style ribs nice. Almost everything here is good. The patio is so much nicer. You can't believe you are in strip mall.until you walk outside and run into a HT",2
"Way too expensive, just because there is no competitioearby. A walgreens is a walgreens, and just because most of your customers are drunk, doesn't mean you should take advantage of them. I was very excited to see a walgreens in the midst of the overpriced stores, but was disappointed to see that the prices didn't match Walgreens stores anywhere else.",1
"This place is hopping! I went on a Sunday and it was super crowded, for good reason. All the little plates of food are really good, but don't go too early. My friends and I were too full by the time the duck and chinese broccoli came out. So, instead of going right when they open at 10 30 AM, it's probably better to go at noon. If you like dim sum, then you should like Chang's.",2
"I've decided to try this new fast food restaurant that is on Rancho. That is near my house. I have only ordered at the drive thru because I like fast service and don't have to wait in line. I tried their deal the 2 for 6 subs, and ice cream sundae. This place looks like DQ. And cheaper then DQ. I like the drive thru service. Good and fast customer service. I'll definitely come back.",2
"I love local gems like this, the food is made with love and wholesome ingredients, which is rare now a days. If you are a veggie or vegan this is a great alternative to the same ol' places you've eaten at a zillion times. Please check them out and support small, local businesses these are what makes Phoenix unique and wonderful.",2
"Pros It's half outdoor, half indoor. So there is air, you can breath, dance around, chill. Plenty of room. Great decor and sound system. over all had a blast and very very impressed. Cons 8 for a water! And if you want alcohol it's like 20 a drink. Expensive even for Vegas prices, so bring your checkbook.",2
"All I can say is ""boneless "" and ""garlic parmesan "" wings. Their fries are yummy and different as well, they have a delicious ranch dressing that I just want to dip like crazy. Mmmmm juicy fresh made to order wings, they never let me down, have been here multiple times and always a success! nWingstop you rock!",2
Came here before a concert. Restaurant had a great view of Palms Place pool. My of a grouper and I had the lamb chops. Both dishes were great. My portion size was big.3 large chops. Very tender and delicious. Sushi was ok. We share the lemon cheesecake.i wish it had more lemon flavor. It was a good dinner overall.,2
"I always enjoy my time at Lot 17. You can just hang out and grab a beer or enjoy some food in the back. The food is amazing. I especially enjoy the Mediterranean Seafood Salad. It is a MUST ORDER. The sweet potato fries are a great compliment to any of the burgers, wraps, or sandwiches. Go to Lot 17, you will not regret it.",2
"Yum yum yum yum yum. Came here for drinks and for a sampling of Fiamma's finest. The crispy calamari was good, but it was the Kobe meatballs that will make your taste buds dance and your Italian grandmother jealous and the Short Rib Raviolini was to die for! Honestly, they had me at ""short rib "" but the entire thing was oh so good. LOVE.",2
"Restaurant and spa staff are very helpful, hard working and nice. The hotel room itself was filthy. Attempts to discuss it and get the management to see the room have yielded no results, so I'm posting a review here. I would not stay here again, given the filthy, shambolic state of the room. See photos for more info.",1
I come to this Sally location every 6 8 weeks and it's by far my favorite. They always have what I need. It's a clean store with helpful sale girls. Whenever I have a question they always offer good advice. And they have a program you can sign up for which saves you money. It does cost 5 bucks to sign up but you get it back the next time you buy something. So it's a win win!,2
"I don't particularly care for the Gold Coast. It's smoky and there are so many better casinos for locals to visit that it's usually not high on my list. They have bowling, which is more times thaot, the only reason I think about visiting. Parking is decent and almost every spot is conveniently located to the casino floor.",1
"Every time I go here, it's something else. nHow can a deli be out of pickles so often? Why does it take 40 minutes to make a hamburger? And why, after 40 minutes, does the burger not come with the toppings that I requested? nAside from the supply and demand issues, the staff is miserable. These folks could really take some pointers from the Squirrel Hill location.",1
"If you want to see 2 inch live roaches, this is the place to see it because you'll waste your time moving from one non working gas pump to another and making 3 trips to the cash register to repeat the mistake again and again and eventually you'll run into the roach again and maybe accidentally step on it. If I could give it negative stars I would.",1
"Very small place on the Plateau, with interesting flavors, such as massala chai. They also have a great variety of sorbet, which you can mix with soft ice cream. Probably one of my favorite non commercial ice cream places in town. By special order, they also make ice cream cakes for special events, check them out!",2
"Waiter was ok. Only checked on us once, which I'm assuming was because he knew the kitchen was in error ! It took 37 minutes for 2 orders of Chicken Tacos. Overall Bad Experience and Food was Average at Best ! Sadly Disappointed ! Also, manager was AWARE of the time it took for our food and NO discount was offered or applied !",1
"After hearing from neighbors that they liked this restaurant we decided to go there for breakfast. Very nice ambience. Then, got water and there was hair stuck to it. Had the Lorraine Omelet not the french eggs I'm used to. The omelet was overcooked and the bacon very overcooked. Otherwise, tasty. Accompanying potatoes very good. Food was only ok and poor value for the money.",1
"When I go out to eat, I rarely consider a Thai restaurant, just because everything I have had in the past is just okay. This is my go to from now on. It's clean, fresh, and flavorful. Kudos to the chef and staff. I ordered the Pud Se Ew with chicken. The veggies were not overcooked, the spicy was perfect and I was surprised at the level of presentation. I will definitely be back!",2
"Checked in, table was dirty and stained. Only 1 device can be on Internet BUT you can add more for 13.95 each. No comp in room coffee 3.50 per cup.this will be a one time stay. Just left circus circus where comp coffee as we had 3 devices using wifi.although LVH gives you 8 credit per day for not having housekeeping come in.",1
This was my second time here. The food is outstanding! Today I had a simple bowl of yogurt with granola and fresh berries. They have many choices of coffee which are very good! The atmosphere is relaxed. There is indoor and outdoor seating. Both the times I spent here was outdoors and today was a beautiful day to spend outside! I highly recommend this place.,2
Had a Amazon Local deal for this place which is close to my office.so we thought we would try. All the Sodas were flat.food was disgusting.my wife's salmon had 7 10 bones still in it. I would never bother to go back and I would think this dump will close soon anyway.oh and the bathroom had an overwhelming odor of sewage. nAvoid,1
"I'm at a loss for the high reviews for this place. Maybe I was there on an off day. I live within walking distance, so I wish I liked it more. nI had a caramel flavored yogurt that tasted just like.sugar. The toppings selection isn't as good as most of the other yogurt shops, either. I'm a mochi fan and there was only one flavor. nMeh.",1
"Don't bother. The Chinese spinach was very good, the duck and peppered steak were not so good. I had the peppered steak removed from my bill because it was so tough. The plum sauce for the duck was weird and instead of a nice little duck breast, they just threw in whatever body parts that suited them. Heed the warnings if those who have posted negative reviews. Again, don't bother.",1
"Everyone at Excel is extremely professional. I loved getting the photos of the status of my car repair in my email. Excel took care of EVERYTHING with the insurance company and even helped me get the rental car through the insurance company. Best of all, they did the repair very timely and even detailed my car! I highly recommend them.",2
"I love this place. nIt is a very cool set up glass garage door, outside patio couch seating, great music. nFINALLY a cool place in Gilbert! nMy fiance and I have gone here a few times, and have yet to be disappointed. nWe've done a wine night, and light dinner drinks. Both were great. nThe bruschetta amazingness. nI would definitely recommend stopping in for a night out.",2
"Couple hundred and no returns, not even a small win. Yeah, that was enough for me to forget about it. Called to see if I had any points or offers and the player's club seemed to hang up on me 4 times after having spoken to me and being rude and I kept calling back until finally they told me I had NO points.as if I did not use my card. I always use my card! BS. Expectations shattered.",1
"Worst mcdonalds ever, 0 stars if that would be possible , I went today 10 8 2013 and asked for extra MnMs on my McFlurry and got literally only 5 MnMs on it , worst service ever , how disrespectful , I hope they close down , i work hard for my money and i expect the best McFlurry every time , not 5 pieces of MnMs and vanilla ice cream , SMH FAM",1
"LOVE THIS PLACE. drive thru, get your fix, and the staff are insanely nice. I don't know how they find such awesome young people to work there, but they are the best. And they give out dog treats my dog loves driving through! BTW, there is a Starbucks literally a few yards from my house, but we drive 13 blocks just to get Dutch Bros. SO MUCH BETTER!",2
"I've been here for a few time. The only item I like here is their roti. Their food is just not authentic. They try to do Malaysian, Thai, and Chinese, but it just makes everything strange. The BBQ pork I ordered last time was super sweet, I didn't eveeed a dessert after. Also, I think everything is overpriced. You can get better food for lower price somewhere else.",1
"I thought this was a great park! So much to offer, Basketball courts, a Hockey Rink, Volleyball, Kids Play area, Soccer fields, Baseball, picnic area plus much more, this place is huge! I hung out here for a little while while waiting to meet up with a friend! Its great to see families and friends hanging out and having a great time!",2
If your looking for something different to eat this is the place.I had a chicken Greek pasty.it was excellent.we stopped for lunch and as we were driving by we saw a decent crowd.so we stopped to see what they were giving away Lol.we enjoyed our choices.it is a laid back place to enjoy the day.so everything was good and the experience was most enjoyable.,2
What happened?!? This used to be a great spot to come relax and have a few drinks and play some keno. They got rid of the old bar staff an brought in some new folks. Seems this new crew is on strict orders from the mothership. They have tightened the machines up and bartenders turn down the music when people put money in wtf? nI guess I'll have to find a new watering hole. Too bad.,1
"I had a tamale combo here with a friend. It was okay, I've had much better for around 12. The tamale was kind of ""fluffy, "" there was hardly any meat inside. Beans were very standard, chips and salsa were okay. The water was absolutely horrible though. It tasted like how sewage would taste. I probably wouldn't come back.",1
"I'm not a fan of extremely loud, trashy, and dirty places, and so this place isn't exactly exciting in my books. Drinks are ok, and food is fine although a friend of mine just had a bad case of food poisoning from their dish of the day. . Not really my cup of tea, but if you're a fan of Irish pubs, I guess this is one of the more popular ones.",1
"Great spot for lunch. Opens at 11 30 so there was no wait since we were a little early. Yes, it's in a sketch part of town. Yes it's in an odd old strip mall. I decided to do the buffet for lunch since I was having a breakdown committing to one dish. I'll probably not do the buffet next time, but it was a good gateway intro to Lotus.",2
"Thinking. that if I went at 810am they would have fresh donuts, but napparently the ones that I got were not. I rather go down the street to Master Donuts. The lady working on the counter thought I was trying to rip her off. I was counting the money in front of her, if i was trying to I would have just toss a bunch of coins on the counter and left.",1
"I give the food 3.5 stars, but the setting and service helps round it up to a 4 star experience. I had the all meat pizza and the portions were generous. The meat and peppers were tasty, but I have had better pizza. My friend had the clam linguine and enjoyed it. Overall, it's a nice place for any occasion.",2
"Good self serve fro yo that taste like soft serve ice cream but they also have tart flavors. Fresh fruit toppings and candies are a plus. They also carry dippi'n dots or something like it as well as cupcakes. All flavors were low fat or fat free. Moderate price, sold per ounce. Definitely worth a try.",2
"Pros n. I am still thinking . Cons n Dirty ass room, when they say ""clean' means you will find trash under the sink n Scary a looking bathroom n stain on the carpet n Rude a servers at their restaurants n the list continues I will NEVER EVER EVER EVER stay here. P.S. 5min international call cost us 65",1
This is a nice concept. Bring your own bottle. We stopped by SAO and got us a bottle of a Saint emilion red wine. It was very good. The service was good as we were seated immediately. We started out with the lamb carpaccio. I think you have to acquire the taste. Then we had main course veal chop. It was tasty. The dessert was chcocalate something. See photo,2
Clearly the best bar downtown and a must visit if you haven't haven't been. It's an echo of the past with one foot in the future. Drinks The drink selection is phenomenal without being pretentious. nSeating Lounge y and bar seating. You can stay here for hours. nPeople The bar staff and ownership are great. The crowd is always a mix of cool people.,2
"Very cool, modern feel to this restaurant and bar. The view from the patio is outstanding as many others have noted. I found the service at the bar to be at bit slow, particularly since they weren't that busy at the time I was there and two bartenders were working. But if you have a chance to go, definitely do it, you'll enjoy the view if nothing else.",2
"Chicken sandwich is good, always fresh vegetables! Fast and friendly costumer service! Always clean and the staff is polite! nThe fries are my favorite and also the part is free refills on the drinks! nI give it a 5 stars because I've been to many Chick Fil A's across the states and i always get the same exceptional service! nGood food!",2
Get the fattoush with chicken! I have now been to this eatery a total of 4 times and I have enjoyed each and every visit. My only complaint is that the safhi that I had ordered as an appetizer the meat was a little dry. It still tasted wonderful but the meat seemed like it was reheated. Great trendy atmosphere and heala good food yumm o The vegetable salata at Aladdin's is to die for.,2
"Go To DIRTY DINING Cathay House in Chinatown. This report will make you SICK, Please view first. The Health Dept. should have the Food Beverage permit cards revoked from the employees or personally fine them for the violations too. This is an incentive for the restaurant and the employees to do their job responsibly. duh.",1
I am so angry about this hotel. I booked the panorama room two month ago for my birthday party. When I arrived the hotel they said they did not have this room and gave me a lower quality room. How can we did not get the room we want if we booked two month ago?! And they did not tell us anything while we arrived the hotel. How can they treat the customer like this.,1
"Shocked! I can't believe the number of people that voted so high on this Sea food restaurant. The sea food is fresh, but I'm not impressed by the presentation or culinary creativity of the restaurant. I thought I would never go here again, but after reading the yelp votes I will make a point to visit the Fish Market Restaurant again.",1
The sushi here is really good. If you like the tiger roll this one of the best places to order it. They have this dish which is called Japarican steak which is pretty much a hamburger patty which is good. You can pick which sauce you want with it. This is a great late night dining restaurant. The only thing bad is that sometimes they take long to make the sushi.,2
I can excuse the mess because I know how inconsiderate customers can be. But there's no excusing the terrible customer service. While checking out the cashier was so busy talking to some long lost friend apparently that she didn't even look at us. And even cussed while talking to her friend and ringing up our items. There is no excusing terrible customer service,1
"I visit this place a few years back, didn't enjoy it much. Much recently, my boyfriend wanted to try it out so I gave it another shot. It was really good! Found out its under new management as of 4 years ago. Great friendly service that's engaging with customers and how can I forget the wide varieties of delicious ice cream and gelato. My favorites the Ghiradelli Chocolate!",2
What can I say this place is a true Vegas hidden gem. One of those place you have to visit if your in the mood for great seafood. I always get the house gumbo spicy 8 10 depending on the chef cooking. It's a small bar with maybe 15 seats so get there early if your going around lunch time or its open 24 hours a day so go when it's less busy. A must try if your in town.,2
Lunch date.ambiance great. After we receive our drinks we are told they are out of beef and pork. What? How can you be a taco restaurant and be out of the 2 most popular meats for tacos? Waitress was spacey and brought only half of my date's order. Salsa was good.chips over cooked. Too bad.such a cute place. Won't be back.,1
"We used to visit this Barros when they first opened, it seems it has gone down hill. We ordered a couple slices for lunch and the crust was drenched in oil and rubber like it was microwaved. It may have been the workers that were here this particular day. I believe in second chances ill try this location again if not better next trip, peace out.",1
"This place has pretty nice decor when you walk in, we can here for lunch and got the lunch specials, which was very inexpensive and a pretty good deal. Comes with soup, salad and soda for 6.95. my bf ordered the pad thai and I got the chicken with bell peppers and basil. It was just bleh and ok to my taste. They gave us hot mustard which I felt was very chinese and not too thai authentic.",1
"over priced and not that good.liked the setting but the food really was not up to par. Had the scallops, lobster and fresh fish of the day. Lobster was very very small and way over cooked. The fresh fish was not so fresh and was burned not blackened but honestly burned . Only redeeming factor was the cocktails. Sorry guys!",1
"The floor is sticky, packed tight that you can't access either the bar or the bathroom if you wanted. Decent number of options on tap however, and it's leagues above Kam's. However it's a lot trashier in quality than Brother's. At least it has an outdoor section for the nicer times of the year which is a huge relief when you want to get out of the sweaty inane madness that is Joe's.",1
"Really enjoy coming down to Shucks to chill, have a drink, and eat seafood. It's really casual and a great place to have a late night bite. The seafood is fresh and the drinks are strong. The wait staff is always really friendly and this has become a regular hang out for us. They have daily specials and is a great place to watch football.",2
"Decent wash, sloppy dry. They had my car for 1hr 40min and still did not manage to find time to dry the car nor finish wiping down the inside. I don't know if they don't have enough employees or the employees they do have just don't care but, they took my money and delivered a piss poor product and did so in an extremely lengthy fashion. Will not be returning to this rip off spot again.",1
"Dinner Crawl in Surprise. It's Panda Express. This is fast food imitation Chinese food! It's good for what it is. Want upscale, go to Pei Wei, that's not good enough, go to PF Changs! see where I'm going with this?! It's Panda Express, get the green bean chicken, feel good about being nice and leaving an honest review. ",2
"Good coffee, good service from friendly staff, pleasant ambience. However, the breakfast burritos are currently under review due to Chef changes. Management assure me things will improve Time will tell and if they do, I will amend this review to reflect that. I generally ride up motorcycle as it is a good hangout to chat with other bike owners and look at the bike porn early of a weekend morn.",1
"This is the only shop I will take my vehicles to. They are friendly, empathetic, honest and always willing to go the extra mile. I cannot recommend them enough, I can only urge everyone to give them a try. I once took my car to another shop see my Auto Tech review , only to be swindled. Aamco came to the rescue and saved me 800.",2
"They screwed up my drink twice and finally made it right the 3rd time. I'm talking major screwup, like a grande latte instead of the ice Venti Vanilla latte I ordered. Oh and it took 20 minutes from when I pulled into the drive through til actually leaving the window. I could see people getting upset in their cars. I hope it's not always like this.",1
Heard about this place the other day . Wow the prices here are awesome. I had the lolly waffle it's a turkey sausage wrapped in a waffle it was great. I also had the west coast wafflewhich a avacado blt so good. I als had a great smoothie. I highly recommend this place the service was awesome as well.,2
"Love the salads and sandwhichh a although I thought it seems overpriced. However, I tried the half pasta today? And the size is smaller than the soup. Not worth 6.99. I'm very disappointed in the quantity and the chicken on top tastes like ham and not cooked well. I will only be coming for a sandwhich in the future. Even the salads are very slim here.",1
"Great shop and polite people! I went there with my corvette and a horrible insurance company. They had great patience with me and my ever so procrastinating insurance, when they finally got the go to fix my car it was done in record timing.They repaired all the work perfectly and even a few extra things not included, which is a rarity these days. I highly recommend Elite auto",2
"I've been going for about a year now and I'm very impressed. They are indeed previously trained Mayo docotors and PA's. In fact, they've designed the exam rooms exactly as they are at Mayo, which is nice. nThe staff is nice, friendly and they always call with results. The waiting room is so relaxing and clean. I wish I had found this place years ago!",2
"Where do you eat for 63 years, always love it never get tired of it? In N Out! So I stopped in to this location for the first time today, joined by Jackie C. Mike C. This time I went with a Double Double 3.30 , Fries well done 1.65 a Chocolate Shake 2.05 . Great food, great dining room, great staff. 5 Stars? Of course! ""Yelp 100 Challenge "" 200! ",2
If it weren't for their location just a block away and on my drive home I would take my business elsewhere. The workers seem so unhappy and annoyed except for the nice man working the meat counter. The food is decent but their attitude always makes it less appetizing. Not to mention I always reheat my arroz caldo because the chicken is not thoroughly cooked so be careful!,1
"Almost a Dive nHad ""Smoked Pot Roast "" Not much smoked flavor. Frozen ""Sweet Potato Fries "", ""Sauteed Green Beans "" had very little flavor and the ""Country Steak "" was almost ground with a very greasy gravy. Service was mediocre at best. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and they weren't busy so things could have been much better if they tried. Assuming they have the skill to do better.",1
"Wings are dry, food is ok, management is terrible. For the price you can get better food if you venture out of the Foothills. I don't come here often, but recently both the service and food have been lacking. Tip for management nIf there's a problem with the bill that's the customer's fault, tell them instead of belittling them. Won't be coming here anymore.",1
"Damn their hot dogs are good! It was my first time here and we split a hot dog, a polish dog, and an Italian beef sandwich. Everything was really really good, but the hot dog was my fave, so go with the original and get that. The bun and all the toppings are fantastic. Great quick spot they even have a drive thru for a sinful comfort food.",2
"With Gumby's closed it was hard to find good pizza in the CU area. Drew's definitely fills the Gumby gap. It reminds me of my favorite place in Chicago, Piece. The pizza is extra cheesy, and the crust actually tastes like it was made not picked up out of cardboard box in the back of a warehouse freezer. Drew's is definitely my go to from now on.",2
This place is pretty cool. They have about 200 or so machines that you can play and is huge nEach machine costs anywhere from .25 to .75 a play. I found that most of the machines that I want to play cost .75 It's really fun to play some of the games from the 1940s and 1950s Overall it's a fun place to go to for about 1 to 2 hours but after that you will get a little bored,2
"Went in Sunday to grab a burrito and was told their rice cooker was broken. So no rice, I had to have salad as a base for my burrito. The chicken was cold and beans undercooked. The flavors and quality of the food are just not nearly as good as Chipotle. This is not even a reasonable substitute, especially at this location. Never again.",1
"A friend of mine took me in for lunch for the first time. The atmosphere is very cute, open and bright, not was what I was expecting from the outside view. Staff was friendly and helpful as soon as we walked in. I ordered the Chestnut Chopped Salad and loved it. The chicken was a little dry but overall a lot of flavor. Look forward to going again!",2
"The food here is pretty good, but expensive for the amount you get. The three times I've been here, they have always screwed up my order or the order of the person I'm with. I contacted the owner about this, and he offered me a gift card which I never got. Lastly, the TVs are so loud you can't hold a decent conversation. But the food is pretty good. That's about it.",1
"This place smells like old wet socks which followed me all the way to my car! Choices of clothes arent even vintage, Aeropostale, echo, fubu, etc . I miss Los Angeles because clothing thriftstores there will guarantee a good find. I went in and left the next 2min literally. Don't bother wasting your time here.",1
"I hated this place. It looks like a nice first date restaurant but the food and price are so not worth it. The hot tofu soup was pitiful and my fiance ordered the bbq and a sushi which were both too expensive for their own good and the sushi tasted like something was old.Never again! Chodang, here I come!",1
"Nice beer selection cheap food. They have Chimay on draft, however they no longer offer this in the beers that they will comp for players. We've taken part in their Thursday Night Trivia Challenge twice, but it's rather disappointing due to disorganization and it's impossible to understand the announcer because of faulty audio equipment.",1
"After a huge disappointment the night before with the buffet, we decided to try the cafe here for breakfast. There was kind of a long line in the morning but it was worth it! The food was good! I ordered a sunny side up egg meal with hash browns and it was tasty. Our waitress was very explanatory and helpful throughout the entire time.",2
"Great place to eat! I was sitting at home craving Chinese and I saw this place on Yelp so I decided to try it out. I ordered the orange chicken combo with fried rice, Mongolian beef and BBQ spare ribs! Highly recommend it! Very tasty food, the delivery was very fast and the pricing was great! Please try this place out if you're looking for really good Chinese food!",2
"Great atmosphere. Amazing food. A very cozy and homy energy to the entire dining experience. Definitely worth going to for a fantastic memory. I stayed to watch some of the food be prepped for the dinner that night, I went for lunch, and the amount of care and attention the chef puts into each step and ingredient is something to be marveled at.",2
Make it a point to come here whenever I'm in Phoenix. Definitely some of the tastiest pizza around and I've yet to have a bad pie. Had some garlic knots which are tasty as well.generally always some sort of line but overall great pizza.did I happen to mention great pizza in Phoenix? Yeah they got that.,2
"Very nice and fancy restaurant. Food was great. The server Josh was awesome. He was alway there to help us. Pros The steak is very good. Tender, juicy and soft, melts in your mouth, nice server, plenty of parking in the garage. Cons EXPENSIVE, 3 steak cost us over 250. Crazy. I will still try this place out.great place if you want to eat somewhere nice.",2
"The restaurant is nice and clean employees were friendly and I really liked the zucchini sticks. nBut the prices are very high for fairly small portions of fast food I feel I could make better at home. If I'm craving zucchini I might go back, but otherwise I think there are better sandwich burger type places nearby. for a much better value. A solid 2 stars.",1
"this is a pretty awesome place for vegas food the hot sandwiches are awesome, plus they're cheap very important after drinking in vegas and they're open late also important after drinking in vegas . centrally located on the strip, tasty, big menu, accommodating of drunkards, etc. i go almost every time i'm in sin city!",2
"I got the thanksgiving all year sandwich.i think they call it the bobbie at another sandwich shop .Fresh not pressed turkey,dressing , cranberry sauce and mayo on a very fresh sub roll. The dressing in this sandwich was awesome very tasty and not too mushy ,a good thing in a sandwich. I will not hesitate to go back , I hear the Italian sub calling me!",2
"This place is fun, authentic, and pretty darn tasty. We got the Chicken Tacos hard shell is the way to go and the Carnitas Plate. Chicken taco was better than the carnitas, but both were yummy. Dessert was a seasonal Apple Empanada AMAZE! As a native Arizonan, I am SUPER picky about my mexican food, but Los Dos won me over.",2
"The service is seriously lacking. Also there's a female bartender there that enjoys ignoring other females. Other than that, cheap specials. Fundido is good. This place is way too ""west valley "" for me so I probably won't be back, went for a friends birthday. If you enjoy mediocre service and bro dudes, this is your spot!",1
"Chicken burrito had to be one of the worst I've had Dried out and tough . The salsa bar needed to be re stocked as well. The Fanta soda was watered down and they didn't have the appropriate lids for my cup. Service wasn't the greatest either, as my cashier could not tell me what was inside the their 3 burrito. Had tried them in the past and it was pretty good. Won't be going back.",1
"The best way to experience dim sum is with a pack of your best friends! Go early! for a weekend lunch. Be adventurous and try everything and yes, that means the chicken feet and tripe, too! . But definitely get the siu mai, har gow, potstickers and eggplant. even the pickiest of your party should find something to enjoy here.",2
ZERO STARS! walked In and the owner didn't great us. She was rude when we asked questions. Told her dog to stop playing! Who does that ? In a place centered around dogs when it's ur own business! Not to mention her dog has a terrible eye infection green goop covering the whole eye. Worst place ever.,1
"Ate there for the first time this morning, what a disappointment, they served me raw eggs and when I complained the waiter was pretty nasty about it. He took them back but he took a long time to bring me new ones and they where burned. If you're in the Madison, WI area, find somewhere else to eat, this place is a disgrace.",1
Went to noca with my wife and our good friend. I had the squid ink tagliatelle and it was great! It had mussels and crab in it and it was fantastic! Noca never fails to deliver on great main dishes. The appetizer was the crawfish beignets and those were somewhat flavorless with too much hush puppy ish type of breading. Overall a good experience,2
This place needs help. The food is just plain bad. Just a bunch of cheap ingredients buried over with sour cream. Go to El Barrio if you get in or for something less formal go to Carolinas or Tee Pee. I went to Los Olivos a long time ago and didn't like it and it seems that it has gotten worse. One star is exaggerating its quality. Looks like I'm never coming back.,1
I wish it was a little quicker and cleaner overall. Our table was sticky and gross which made me think that the kitchen was probably not clean either. I always get what I believe are called crazy noodles and it tastes pretty good. Maybe if the service was much faster and the place was cleaner I'd go again.,1
"My favorite pizza in Madison, WI. http www.yelp.com biz photos aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA?select jRGZL2b1hdZcoZszIcBQRw I could care less if the pizza is pre baked and that the crust is meh. Did you see what was on my pizza?! And yes, that is all it takes to wow me sometimes. So glad I got to have that pizza again after a 5 year hiatus.",2
"We went late, around 5pm and they did not have much left, but this is a good thing as you know everything is made fresh daily and not left to sit around. Tried some kind of Almond crusted chocolate thing and now it is all I can think about. French bread was good as well as the cherry Strudel. Next time I plan to go earlier to bask in the full selection of goodness.",2
"I actually didn't spend much time in here on my last trip, but Diane did bet on a few horse races while I was in a Poker Tournament. The first thing she mentioned when we met up afterwards was how nice she thought the Sports Book was. With that endorsement from a Vegas Newbie, I think they deserve another 5 Star rating!",2
Played the awesome golf course shot 85 and had lunch outside on the patio. Everything was delicious and satisfying. The Tonto ritas were refreshing and the white shrimp tacos to die for. The avocado crema served on the side was a perfect compliment to the ancho chili sauce on the shrimp n veggies. My wife and I visit this area once a year to spend time with family and I cannot wait to go back!,2
Pretty awesome place with the Wild West theme. Obviously not the best food in the world but it's still a pretty awesome place. I ordered a cheddar cheese burger and it was delicious! Everyone else with me seemed pleased with their meals as well. Not the cleanest place in the world but what do you expect at a ranch? You can even go outside and watch some riddin!,2
"Hidden gem near the hospital on McDowell and 12th street. Don't let the small size fool you, the sandwiches are delicious and creative, and we just found out they deliver. Yeah! We found this place after winning a fundraiser auction for AZ Women in Song, so thanks for supporting our community, and for the great eats! We will be back.",2
"Being vegan, me and my wife ordered Earth Burger veggie and to be honest this was the worst burger we have ever eaten. 15 for such a crap. On top of that they won't even serve you any sides. Serving size is also small. I am not going to this place again ever ! If you want some really awesome burger, try Veggie Burger in Grand Luxe Cafe in Venetian or Palazzo. You will love it.",1
"The quality of the food is always trumped by the absolutely terrible service. My orders have constantly been wrong, cold, and over charged and the staff comes across as completely apathetic. The only reason this location gets the second star is that the location does seem to be clean and well presented, but it truly is a gilded facade and nothing more.",1
I will bet my money that the fish is frozen! It looks like those frozen breaded fish sticks that you get out of the box.remember when you were a kid? nThe salad was fine but the dressing I swear was the Kraft stuff which is ok if that's what you want.somehow I was wishing that we stayed home. nThe quality of the meal was pretty disappointing at best so I dont remember anything else.,1
"After going to the E. Sahara and Henderson DMV's for years, we decided to go here to schedule my driving test. This DMV is super clean, as are the bathrooms, and the line did not look long at all. This place has plenty of parking and the customers aren't as rude as the ones at Henderson, the technicians also seemed to be nice, overall it was a great experience and a very comfortable building.",2
"We came here after the Holidays and a few times since then. Normally, it's a busy day of shopping followed by HH and we were very impressed by both the food and the interesting drink offerings. The food is interesting as well as outstanding. The wait staff seems to kick it into high gear when it starts to get crowded. A big WOW! I would highly recommend Tommy Bahama's to anyone! Enjoy!",2
"This place was pretty good I got there version of the cheese steak and it was really on point, The wife got the chicken and waffels not so good, I will deffinetly come back to try something else, good vibe good service, down side was only outside seating in the sun was left and portions were a bit small, oh and no regular type soda like coke they have there version of cola that tasted weird to me",2
"I had the veal flank steak here and it is one of the best I've ever had. Got recommended to come here and it was worth it. Food 4 5, juicy veal with great sauce. The duck confit was very good as well. Service 3.5 5, a little slow but very nice stuff that is attentive Ambience 4 5, cool decor and very fun atmosphere for dinner. Price 3 5, a little pricy 30 person",2
"The food is too pricy for the quality. Spare ribs were not the best, soup was very plain and both entr u00e9es were loaded with sodium and were below par. The staff is friendly and offered good service. The atmosphere is nice but what good is a pretty cell phone with bad reception and dropped calls? Would never come here again.",1
"Delivered the wrong food, and didn't pick up the phone when we tried to raise the alarm. Whatever the food was they delivered was 2 star quality, which is why I didn't 1 star them. Very nice on the phone, very nice delivery, but the food borders on really bad. The potstickers are a must avoid, and the lo mein had very old chicken. This place should be better, but it's just not.",1
"Sorry Barro's, the tomato in our antipasto salad still had a label on it, good thing I looked before I ate! Do you wash your raw salad fixins before you use them? Pizza was cold to the point where cheese was set. I live less than half a mile from you, step up your plates if you want to stay in business.",1
"A great place for all you M M lovers, you name it they've got it. 3 floors maybe 4, i forgot of M M craziness from clothing, toys, souvenirs, dvd's, they have a little theater to watch a mini show and you could learn the history of the iconic candy . It's great for the kids and one of those places you have to visit when you are in Vegas",2
"We had a two bedroom suite. It was pretty amazing. Very nice for the younger hip crowd. There was 5 big screen TV's and a projector in our suite. There was only three of us but this room would have easily slept 8 people comfortably. I will come back if the price is right. The pool was nice too, waitresses sucked.",2
"service is too slow. And the restrount is overpriced. The most ridiculous thing is when I give 10 tip, the japaness waitress give the money back to me and ask for at least 15 tip. This is the first time I was asked for more tip. Especially for the sooooo slow service, how can she ask for more tip? Oh maybe she know this is the last time we came to this bad restaurant, so she doesn't care.",1
"We visited Sushi Ken for lunch today, and it was excellent. The prices are extremely reasonable, and the food is delicious. We had the spicy mini chirashi and a spicy tuna roll for lunch and finished it off with a melon cream soda. They included a nice little salad or edamame your choice and miso soup with lunch. I will be back!",2
Came here on a whim after our attempt at mexican food failed. This place ended up pretty awesome. Pizza was great and different. Who would have thought eating pizza in squared slices other than the traditional wedges would have been so cool? The dessert topped our evening with the baked cookies with ice cream on top we came out a 5 pounds heavier with a smile on our faces!,2
"Is it possible to give zero stars? If so, Katerbean would rate a zero. Bad atmosphere, unfriendly employees, slow and reluctant service, pump your own coffee, dingy interior, dirty tables. If they only had telescreens which couldn't be switched off, then this place would be a perfect setting to film Orwell's ""1984 "".",1
"Overall dining experience was good. Service, even though we chose an outdoor table, was terrific. Food was good not great. Marinara sauce was thin and bland. Veal parm was overcooked and the accompanying pasta was way too al dente. Will likely give it another try because the staff was so nice. In the meantime I am heading back to Portofinos.",1
Bring a 24 pack of beer because the wait is worse than DMV and you'll most likely finish the beer before your called up. The workers don't pay any attention to arrivals and leave them waiting for hours without reassuring the customers that they will be helped soon. Not even a eye contact. Did not feel like a customer. I am switching carriers.,1
"Hey, finally! A Mexican restaurant I actually CRAVE to return for their food. Simple, fresh, delicious. My favorite is the Al Pastor made just the way I want with the fresh ingredients I choose. My wife loves their Pibil, Green Chili, as well as the Barbacoa. Spicy! For her the wet burrito is the way to go.",2
This place is pretty good. I love the tomato based sauce! The pulled pork is really good and so is the brisket. My only complaint is the Mac and cheese. It taste like there's mayonnaise in it or something and that is just not appealing to me. It's not the best bbq I've had but its also not the worst. When I want bbq this will prob be the place I go. Just wish the Mac and cheese was better.,2
"I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could. The food was lousy, the drinks were expensive, and the service was awful. I complained to the manager about my experience and he told that if I didn't like it, there were plenty of other bars in The Strip District. Please, please, please go somewhere else.",1
"Honestly, I feel like Pink's is way overrated. It's not absolutely terrible but I've definitely tried better hot dog places. And if you're visiting Vegas, you should be trying one of the many other amazing restaurants anyway. If you don't want to spend too much money but still want something delicious, I'd recommend going to Earl's Sandwich.",1
Simple breakfast food took about an hour to get to us. When we asked about it our server gave us attitude and rolled his eyes. When the food finally came it was subpar and hashbrowns were cold. Will never go there again and won't recommend. The last thing you want when you're hungover and hungry is bad food service that takes forever.,1
"Happy Hour appetizers and beer were decent, especially if you like fried food. Service was somewhat below average but tolerable. Staff had no idea what beers were on tap, and the menu had some errors. Great location with good parking. Don't know how they can screw things up. Maybe the location is what keeps them in business.",1
"I celebrated my wedding anniversary and by far the best food I've had in Vegas. The food had so much flavor. You will deff get your money's worth! We tried the shrimp cocktail it was amazing! The Cobia was so tasty And my husband tried their chicken everything was good. We also went to the lounge right next door and it was fun good music, good drinks and beautiful view can't go wrong with that!",2
"I am rating the food. Not the bar . Let's say, I take a thin ground beef patty and take a mallet, and pound the crap out of it so that it's shape isn't even round any more. That is their Backdraft Burger. Don't even try to order a medium rare one. They are all cooked the same like a fast food joint. Was disappointed with their burger. As far as the bar environment I would give that three stars.",1
"Reposting this to make sure Iit sticks DO NOT GO, AVOID THIS PLACE Had the 9.99 Steak and lobster nWasn't given option on potatoe, no option wether 'fresh' vegetables or salad nThe Vegetables where obviously frozeThe lobster was way over cooked and steak was over 1 2 gristle. NASTY FOOD, POOR SERVICE, BAD NEIGHBORHOOD",1
We've been eating here for about 10 years now and it has only gotten better! Mario always takes time to visit with us and now that they have become wireless the service is very good plus they now have a full time bartender so that eliminates having to wait for one of their tasty Cadillac Margaritas. The Chipotle Shrimp is our favorite but their Green Chili Pork is quite tasty too!,2
"Thank you yelpers again for leading me in the right direction! Tom Ka soup was good not great, not enough heat and coconut flavor. The Basil Chicken was Amazing! Fantastic. The Shrimp Fried Rice was Excellent a bunch of plump Juciy perfectly cooked Shrimp! Great and Friendly Service! The bathrooms were very, very clean, this is a good sign of the kitchen as well. Keep up the great work!",2
Waiting 19 minutes and counting for food. Drive thru getting food but not diners. Received food after 20 minutes. One counter person friendly the other was not. Out of frosted mugs as well. How do you let your freezer not be stocked when customers are counting on the frosty mug root beer. Will not come back.,1
"This mall used to be one of the best. I used to enjoy coming here, until I had something stolen from me here. Compared to the Fashion Show mall, this is tiny. My grandpa used to take me here when I was little, so going here bring back memories. From what I hear, the food court has downsized a lot. If they clean up, I may just start coming back.",1
"Meh nMEHHHHHHHHHHH Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. nI ended up with the giant seafood pancake thing off of the lunch menu, the Okonomiyaki. I thought the flavors were ok, but the seafood was pretty chewy and rubbery. From all the glowing reviews here on yelp, I expected different I guess. nMehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I probably won't be back.",1
"Probably the best yellow curry and pad Thai anywhere in the Phoenix area. The coconut ice cream was a nice, lite treat, too. Very friendly staff. When I went in, they seemed to know the regulars which were quite a few. One downside, seemed a little pricier than most other Thai restaurants, but worth it. Definitely going back.",2
"The aroma drew me after leaving the movies. You get a bowl. Choose a frozen meat. Top it with seasoning salt of ur Choosing, veggies add that with a bowl of marinade. Rice or some sort of noodle. Then u wait, observe, collect your drink. Sit and eat. Then yogurt. All under 12 bucks. And so much to take home. Very pleased with this find!",2
"This was by far the worse car wash i have ever paid for and the most expensive. I contacted paradise mobile detail because i wanted a top shelf detail done on my truck, but unfortunately i got nothing but poor work. I do not recommend paradise mobile detail to anyone. You're better off going to a car wash.",1
"The boyfriend and I went here last night again and knew I wanted to give Zs some cyber love!Our friend recommended it, and whew are we glad he did! We have been back 5 times, and always trying something new. Really great. Also love the stamp card, we get a free meal next time we go in! Try the sangria can't beat it for 9!",2
"Awesome sports bar. Actually went here for the night life after hitting a few other bars just a lively bar blasting some of the best hits with music videos to match. I duno, I just like when they play the music video that goes to the songs you like. There used to be a TV station that would play music videos and it was pretty cool.what was it called again? OH YEAH! MTV!",2
"You get what you pay for. This aint no 99 cent hot dog joint that you would find on the strip or downtown. The Capital Grille is definitely up there with Morton's and Ruth's. The service was excellent and the steaks were even better. They also offer fish, crab and lobster usually at market price. You can bring a group of friends or enjoy a night out with someone you just met on the strip.",2
"My torsion spring broke on my 2 car garage door. They got to my place in 1 hour and replaced my broken single torsion spring with a high quality dual torsion spring and finished the job in only 30 minutes. I received fast, efficient and professional service from them at a good price. I highly recommend them and would use them recommend them in the future",2
"I try. Really I do. But I am a ToGo's girl. I grew up with my 9 pastrami sandwich. This location was fast, they did good with our food, well as good as you can with processed meats. My only complaint is the layout of the store. Could have been configured better. I only gave it 2 stars because when I do eat here, I always get sick. Now if I lost weight, I'd give them a star back! Haha!",1
"Much better than the one in Chinatown. They have the fermented chives in the sauce section which adds an amazing flavour to your dipping sauce. The interior decor is pretty good and the spacing is great. The service, however, is not very efficient given they only have 2 3 waiters, even during dinner time.",2
"Horrible! Will never go back. The man who did my nails when I first came in did a horrible job, do much so that another lady has to take over to ""fix ""it and yes she did a better job than him but that's not saying much. She dug the tremal so far in my nail bed I was bleeding. And to top or all off they messed up the color! So mad",1
"I was nearby needed a quick fill pedi. Found this hidden gem. Great hours, open until midnight which is awesome. Nice staff, I believe I was chatting with the owner. I was very pleased with my services would definitely come back again. Very polite attentive as well, cold beverages offered as soon as your seated.",2
"What ever happened to customer service. They lost it a long time ago and want to blame the government for their under staffing and being out of merchandise. I have driven 20 miles out of my way, round trip, 4 times now because they can't transfer you to the guns department for a simple question. I wont be back. What a crappy way to treat people! Bass Pro Shop, here I come!",1
"Watery yogurt, lack of flavors very generic , hardly any toppings and just one fruit option kiwis , unfriendly staff. The wait staff stayed in the back the entire time other than to ring me up and didn't even make eye contact with me. I didn't think the yogurts tasted very good and it definitely had an icy watery consistency without much flavor. Would not return.",1
"I have no affiliation with this merchant but I did try one of their pizzas tonight and was very impressed. The pizza is sold uncooked and of course comes with easy baking instructions. What set it apart for me was a very generous portion of fresh ingredients. And a bonus is that you only pay 1.67 sales tax, the same as on grocery products. The owner's name is Doug.",2
"Had high hopes thanks to a couple of recommendations. It was ok, not too expensive, food was maybe four stars. The location is quite unique under a bridge opposite Mesa, AZ. Service was alright, not really up there perhaps, but I don't think they need to worry too much as it's always busy. If you're looking for somewhere interesting to have a quick bite, you could do a lot worse.",2
"I've been there a couple times for lunch. Besides the fact that the beef tartar is quite heavy on the mayo, their food is great! The set up is cute and bright, the prices are reasonable for good quality! I've never been there for dinner but would definitely recommend you try it for a quick yet tasty business lunch.",2
"Service was mediocre. Asked for the dishes to come out as they're ready, because we were starving.but the dishes came out together and a few were lukewarm. Since the temperature was off, they didn't taste that great. The interior is super dark, in the afternoon, this was just annoying. The only plus is that they offer mini pastries.",1
"Cab said ANLV on the side, driver asked me for a good tip, tipped him 20 and he went off on me and got out dollar bills and tried to give them to me saying my tip was not goid enough. I wish I hadn't tipped him at all. Unbelievable what a person expects from a 5 minute cab ride down the strip. Avoid at all costs if possible.",1
"Michelle was great. She was very knowledgeable, professional and informed me of products, without making me feel pressured to purchase. I had 2 treatments in the office and each one took about 20 minutes each. I actually went to the Scottsdale location which was being revamped. Looking forward to seeing it when it's finished! Thanks Michelle for a great experience!",2
"This McDonald has useless workers who don't listen when taking an order. It's not that had to push a button that says no onions on a cheeseburger. If I hadn't looked my son would had eaten onions that he is not able to eat. Great job McDonalds for trying to kill my son. Get real employees that listen when taking an order, then just there for a pathetic check.",1
"This is a great place for grabbing some breakfast while watching football. There's enough screens that they can usually put what ever game you want on. Servers are always very nice. 6 gets you 2 eggs, hash browns, toast and the best ever bacon. Their bloody mary is spicy and tasty too. Good drink and food specials during football games.",2
Horrible customer service at the Arrowhead location! Every time I go into this place it takes far too long and employees are rude. There is no organization and I have witnessed customers being helped completely out of order.leaving others to wait longer. Seriously they need to get their act together and hire some employees that have an IQ above mental retardation. Don't take your business here!,1
I was looking forward to this place based on the reviews here. I ordered my favorite dish which is General Tso Chicken and white rice. The rice was fine but the chicken chunks tasted just average. I went at about 10pm last night 08 25 2012 . I am thinking about trying this restaurant once more just to see if it is better the next time.,1
"I went there for lunch today. The food seemed pricey. I had the mushroom pizza for 14 which was OK, there were 2 pieces left and neither I or my guest took it home. The Italian salad was very good but a bit pricey for 12. We had coffee and it was so weak we could not drink it. The service was good but I don't think I would go back.",1
"Fried gnocchi. FRIED GNOCCHI. This place is super cute and the food is amazing. Be careful though, because it's BYOB and you might drink a whole bottle of wine and some fruit punch vodka with sprite and then go to Alleghney Wine Mixer where you drink more wine . Just sayin. The scallops are also awesome, but best of all was the honey butter! I want to eat it on everything!",2
"Every time that I have ate from here, which kid you not has been at least once a week. Their food and service has been great. Highly recommend everything from the menu. My favys and regulars are the chicken pad se ew, beef fried rice, drunkeoodles and the wonton soup. Very fulfilling, great taste and price.",2
"Burned pizza, tasted like smoke, literally. The worst pizza I have ever had. I took it back and was told it was perfectly cooked. Not to your customer it wasnt. A full refund would have been appropriate. It was charred black on the bottom. Customer service should have prevailed but no go at FORGE. 16.00 for a pizza that was barely edible.",1
"My boyfriend and I came here to look for some good breakfast. Their food is tasty at first, but it takes just for one or two bites later until you realize that it's way too greasy and extremely salty! We had ordered multiple items since we were very hungry and we were completely disappointed when all of their food tasted exactly the same! A salty heart attack!",1
"I have been coming here for a long time. I come as much as once a week. The food is amazing and the service is great. Even if you come in and it's busy, as long as you are patient and understand it's to die for. I've never had a bad roll or bad service. I recommend it. I don't understand how anyone could have a bad time here.",2
"NO! I went here with my cuz and her aunts thinking I was going to get a great Montreal club experience that I've been hearing about for ever. NO NO NO! I DO NOT LIKE TOURIST SPOTS! It's the local spots that are better. It had a turning dancefloor, it was so crowded AND the boys just grabbed me to dance. That's wrong. You ask. NO never ever again.",1
"First timer. Loved the atmosphere. Very quaint and small. If you are looking for a crowd and huge establishment wrong place. They offer a DJ, Drinks, Hookah, and nice conversation. I will definitely be going back and meeting new people. No food is on the menu so be prepared to eat prior or go after. Avg. drink is 8 which is reasonable being that the alcohol content is great ",2
"If you are looking for a tasty, quick lunch, McKoy's is for you. Food was excellent I ordered the pulled pork platter and the service was friendly. I placed my order and within 5 minutes, I was ready to chow. Highly recommend. I bet this place is great for watching sporting events or having a cocktail at happy hour. Two thumbs up!",2
Server was josh sat in the lounge area. waited at least 50 min for our food a table sitting in front of us that came in after us.ate paid and left before our food was out. had to ask for refills service sucked the cook in the back that brought out food gave us more attention then our own service. sad,1
Absolutely amazing. They redid my down stairs with 8 can lights and it looks great. Hayden was extremely fair priced and professional. The work was done with no dry wall repair needed. I will be using them for the rest of my home for sure. Hayden also added in a dimmer and made my room perfect. Highly recommend and fairly priced.,2
"This place is great. I just loved my breakfast, the Killer Scramble with egg whites. My husband had the Farmers Scramble also fantastic. My salmon was just the right amount of smoke, the goat cheese the right amount of creamy and the side salad was a perfect addition. We drove today but plan on making this our walking breakfast destination.",2
"Love QuickTrip! If you want to get gas go to QT, you want a snack, go to QT, you want a clean bathroom. Go to QT! If it is possible for me to get to a quick trip over any other gas station I will take it. QT is always my first choice. I am amazed at how clean eveything is all the time. I appreciate how well they take care of the stores.",2
"a very cozy diner in a very hectic casino. lots of booths. nok service not enough drink refills never came back to ask how it was nsirloin was great, salad was great , green beans kinda sucked cold hard. soup was good only 2 noodles though. sausage was greasy. and spaghetti tasted like the plastic colainder that was used. yuck! nwhat the hell is green beans w spaghetti anyways",1
"Found this restaurant through restaurant.com. We started off with a salad made with bagged lettuce . I had the Chicken Marsala, the flavor was decent, but the sauce was very watery. My husband had the ravioli and it was very bland . Honestly, most frozen ravioli is better than this stuff. The decor was also pretty out dated and needs to be updated.The service was good, but we won't be returning.",1
I'm an out of towner visiting my Parents for the Christmas weekend. I brought my two dogs in for a bath after doggie park. The two ladies were very friendly and helpful. I've never been to a self wash before and this was a great first time experience! Price was reasonable for the product offered. And they give a Military discount!,2
"We went for the Christmas Day buffet. Terrible food, loud dining room, service was non existent. Seated nearly an hour late for reservation. Advertised food like a prime rib serving bar and herb crusted turkey which were not on the buffet. Feel like we were duped. 29 per person for really bad food was not what we were expecting. Will not go back and will do our best to deter others.",1
"ordered the Sage Chicken and Bacon Waffles. Just how do they get the bacon into that waffle iron, fantastic! Sage fried chicken was two breasts, which required some additional salt to bring out the deep fried goodness. Overall pretty solid and a huge portion. Servers are very attentitive. The place gets packed so come before the 'walkers' come in.",2
"Loved this place! One of the same owners of the former ""Houston's "" restaurant. The prime rib was mouthwatering! The beans were to die for. This place has a great feel to it. The service possible needs to be upgraded a little. Two managers walked by our table a few times and never said anything to us. We had to ask them to stop and check to see how we were doing.",2
"Everything was perfect! The evening, decor, staff, drinks, food, friends. I had the 3 course dinner option, not a complaint. With 3 other people we pretty well covered the menu, and everything was cooked, presented, and tasted great! I cannot wait for my next visit to Las Vegas or perhaps San Francisco to go again. Well worth the experience.",2
"Tex Tubb's food is better and less expensive. While the food was presented nicely, I was not impressed with my burrito. Pretty bland and the whole time I was just wishing I had gone to Tex Tubb's. Although my margarita did make up some for my disappointment in the food. Maybe the brunch is better here, but I definitely would not go back for dinner.",1
"Great food and atmosphere. I split the 34 oz ribeye, bone marrow and potatoes with my wife and it was amazing. Good quality steak that was a perfect medium rare, medium. Enjoyed a few beers and cocktails as well. This place is ideal for a business dinner, or date night. I hear their brunch is phenomenal as well. I'll be back!",2
"1000 sq ft, a full kitchen and whirlpool bath, terrace, and only 2 blocks from the strip for only 120? Wow. Also next to 7 11. Spa and cardio only gym and pool. Now the negatives pool spa and gym on diff floors, valet only parking, walk to strip a little ugly at night, a bit boring, and not upscale like Aria or Wynn, more like Harrahs or Treasure Island, no casino ? . Still the best deal in town.",2
"Slices Pizza is pretty good, not the best though. But if you are on Mill Ave its the best Pizza option. Uno's is around the corner and probably the worst pizza in Phoenix. If the main guy that works there was not so rude probably would have given it 3 stars. If you are in Tempe a much better Pizza place is Red Devil Pizza about 5 minutes South.",1
"Why do people like this place? Can't they buy a loaf of sliced bread, some deli meat and some dijon mustard at any grocery store and make a comparable sandwich? I am a long time Phoenix resident, and I have always thought this place was BORING! I have to meet people here once in a while, and always make up the excuse that I have already eaten.",1
"Not really impressed, sorry! The wait was long, so we decided to get take out. It was really confsuing to order, and it took over half an hour to get some noodles. The guy was pretty rude when I asked how long it was going to take. We should have just gotten food from the coop, because for 9 I got some noodles with a few pieces of shrimp and some iceburg lettuce.",1
"Subs were pretty good. Not as good as Firehouse, but so much better then Subway or Quiznos. Each sandwich shop has their own unique taste. This is theres. Tasty bread. Could use more meat. A little too much mayo and lettuce, but I like alot of lettuce, and I'll just ask for might mayo next visit. I called for delivery and it was at my door within 11 minutes. Cant say any pizza joint can pull that.",2
"Good stuff. Unusual, for me anyway, but always enjoy trying something different. nI've never ordered anything from here but what they have on the shelves has been tasty and fresh. nWe've had breakfast or lunch her on a few occasions and that's good. Nothing fancy though. nOne thing about this place is it's very small. Like maybe two tables that seat four and maybe a two top too.",2
They did a really mean thing today The musician scheduled to come in and set up was told while setting up that they would not have the money to pay him tonight! He was just in to confirm last night. That was really a mean and nasty thing to do to someone. CALL THEM AT LEAST A DAY A HEAD OF TIME STUPID! These people are disreputable! Now they are CLOSED! Figured as much.,1
"I've eaten at Smash Burger in New Orleans which was by the best, I've eaten at the location in 1000 oaks which was OK, and now Las Vegas which was shit. N.A.S.T.Y. The consistency of the 3 smash burgers are all different and don't taste the same. Skip this shit shack and go next door to In and Out and have a double double. The 2 stars were for the really good oreo cookie shake.",1
This McDonalds has very poor service. The employees seemed like they did not want to work there at all. Food sometimes takes quite some time to come out. I go here since it is right next to work and is very close. Other coworkers also complain about this McDonalds not being that great and recommended me to actually go out of my way to a different place to get breakfast.,1
"They sold me a discontinued toilet, installed in an hour, and charged me 380.00. The toilet, which I looked up the brand and model number later that day, costs 89.00. So, not only did they sell me a discontinued toilet and didn't tell me which is pretty lame, but they charged me almost 300.00 for one hour of labor as well. Pretty sketchy business practices.",1
"Great food, great service, great ambiance! Been a fan of Puck since first going to Spago in California ten years ago. And this pizza bar has a creative menu, welcoming environment, and terrific service, all at a mid price range. They even have a daily wine special and the 4 cabernet was actually pretty good. nIf you haven't been, you should try it. Hope to try the patio next time.",2
"Went to this location for two years and had a horrible experience. The doctors were ruid and they didn't understand my insurance and overbilled me. On my last appointment, I was less than five minutes late and they made me wait for 45 minutes. It wasn't until I said that I was leaving that conveniently they stated they were about to take me in for my appointment.",1
"I absolutely love this place! I love the food, the atmosphere, the food, the ambiance, the people, the pro bicycle mentality, etc! Go eat their monkey cakes and drink a capp! I did have to wait a bit during one of my last visits however, they were SLAMMED and we ordered a crapload of delicious food. I'm happy to wait a bit for delicious food. Ready to go back!",2
"I don't believe in God, I believe in breakfast, and any place within biking distance of home and work that serves breakfast ALL DAY is the winner, all day every day. I've only had three meals there but all were great chorizo torta, chilequiles, and pancakes. And let's not forget my favorite, most needed breakfast accompaniment a delicious, spicy bloody mary. Drooling.",2
"I only gambled here and only briefly. It's a little too hot in there and you'll have a hell of a time finding a cocktail waitress. Really cool interior, though. They should find someone to paint one of those crazy depth perception boggling things on the ceiling to make it look like the Eiffel tower extends up into the sky. If you've been there, you know what I mean. It would be really cool.",1
Stopped in to get a smoothie after a class at kidville with my two young children. We are all violently ill after sharing a few sips of smoothie before I threw it out because it didn't taste right. Called to let them know to hopefully prevent this from happening to any one else. Will not be returning.,1
"The food made my mouth water like the Niagra Falls. The service was great! I ordered half of their menu one time, and like a wild vulture from the African Plains, I devoured it all! After a while I took a 3pound crap at work and the bathroom was off limits for awhile. All in all, it was worth the brown volcano. Come here and try out all their great selections! This place is great!",2
"Great place for a quick lunch or breakfast. The menu is pretty basic but it has some twists.it's sandwiches, salads and soups and pastries, breads, etc. Right now I'm into their turkey cranberry panini, and I love most of their salads and panini options. They have vegetarian options, and the calorie counts are posted on the menu, which I love.",2
"I come to this clinic because I LOVE Dr. Fields. I followed him from VCA to Sandy Hill and couldn't be happier with the level of service I receive. I recommend him to all my friends. The front staff are friendly and I always get an appointment, even when I call last minute. I've been to plenty of clinics in my time, and I recommend this place hands down.",2
"Really solid burgers! All three of us that went were impressed, but it was nothing all that unique to be blown away by. They make their own veggie burgers which is pretty cool though. Fairly good beer selection to wash it down with. They have some regional micro stuff but once agaiothing off the wall.",2
"Awesome thin crust pizza. The crust is cracker crispy, just burnt enough on the edges to give it the right smokiness. The toppings are just right too. Does anyone even order anything else? FYI to Holly S., there was a Monical's in Chicago's Western Suburbs Lombard? a few years ago but sadly, it closed.",2
"Long due review here. Took my girl here for a special occasion. Made a request to be seated on the balcony when I made my reservation. We got seated promptly. Service was attentive and food was great. price is a little steep but you should already know that before deciding to dine here. it's definitely a experience and very romantic place. btw, she said yes.",2
"Lounge is definitely the proper description of the Vanguard. There's ample room to stand and talk we would have actually preferred a few more seats where we could rest our weary legs , the prices ain't too bad midrange , the music was chill and a good volume for keeping up the engaging conversation, and the decor is sharp and fresh. Great place to start a bar hopping evening on Fremont.",2
Hail Caesar! This place is simply a wonderfully designed mall. If I am going to be dragged around shopping I at least appreciate being in a place that is decorated in such a manner. Great shops and a wonderful location to people watch. Minus one star for lack of seating and information maps to guide you around.,2
"So overrated. I was so disappointed. If you plan on eating buffets on the strip, start with this one and end with the Wynn Buffet. We did the opposite, and oh how sad I was. The atmosphere is meh and the food was ok. I guess it wasn't that bad considering it was only 20, but for that I could have gotten a delicious breakfast at the Hash House A Go Go and been much happier.",1
"If you're looking for appliances, plumbing supplies, toilets, keep looking! Pacific Sales has difficult to understand pricing, limited products on display, and long wait times for delivery. Most ordering is from a catalog that does not have prices. Do yourself a favor and skip the aggravation that accompanies shopping at Pacific Sales.",1
I'm surprise about the rating about Tea Planet.it should be more stars.cos to me.is really good.they have a good selection of drinks.I pick different drinks all the time.and is always good.I love their thick toast.and their food is great.I've been to a lot of these Taiwanese boba places.in NYC and SF but this one is my favorite. ,2
My favorite Arby's I have been going here for years and I never got a bad meal out of this spot and they're always friendly. I tried the brisket sandwich for the first time and I was pleased with it. They make sure the sweet tea is on the money every time! A must spot that I have to hit whenever I am in Charlotte.,2
Definitely not a fan. The food was so so. Not worth the price IMO. The service was also extremely lackluster. For a Sunday night with only 2 tables it sure did take an awfully long time for our food to come out. Our appetizers also came out after our entrees. My glass was empty about half the time. Even with a groupon I feel like we wasted money by eating here. I would go to PF Changs instead.,1
"Great Jets bar during NFL season, really want to try their burgers. Drool over seeing them, which they're 5 on Monday nights. Just really wish they would get their mobile menus and prices updated synced with.their actual menus and prices specials and prices listed on their mobile site are 2 different worlds altogether.",2
Excellent batter makes excellent crepes. These guys really do a great job of making crispy crepes and filling them with fresh fruit and other goodness. I really enjoyed the Bananas Foster and the East Meets West. Definitely add strawberries to the East Meets West. It's so yummy! Definitely will be back for more. too bad I don't live on this side of town. sigh.,2
If you can request the Augustus towers than do it. They are new and awesome view of Bellagio fountains if you can get that south side view. nLike all nice hotels on the strip it is very expensive. Great location. I have stayed here several times and the staff is very cordial and wanting to please you. They realize you have a choice.,2
"Kevin left Juno. What a disastrous news! Honestly, Cozy's skill is not on the par with Kevin's. He is a bit impatient when I give my opinion about his style design and I do believe I have right to say what I feel about my hair. I don't wanna hear the word like "" what do you want? "" with grievance and contempt any more!",1
"Smashburger, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways I love your rosemary sweet potato fries. I love your AZ burger and the fresh jalape u00f1os. I love your grilled AZ salad freaking awesome. And lastly, My kids would kill maim for your new mint Oreo shake. Smashburger, we're going to have a long and lovely relationship.",2
"Walked into our assigned room and it smelled of smoke. There was only a tiny double bed and the place appeared dirty. When I went to the lobby to complain about the cleanliness of the room, another hotel guest was complaining about bedbug bites. I told the front office to cancel our reservations as we didn't want to stay there.",1
"Worst customer service ever. Love seeing employees wandering around, doing nothing while many people stand in line. I also love seeing employees on their cell phones on company time. Must be nice to have a job where you can do nothing and get paid for it. As a manager of a retail store, I was pretty disappointed in what I saw. Never going back.",1
Love Love Love this place! I go to babycakes and other vegan bakeries in California and Treehouse Bakery is soooo much better than all of those. They have a wide variety of flavors and my fiance who is not a vegan even loves their stuff. They are even way better thaon vegan cupcakes! My favorite is the red velvet cupcake! I HIGHLY recommend you try it!,2
"Have to agree with Simian re the fish fry. Same experience pretty much. Service aside that was good Fried cod way way way over cooked, salad bar . . . warm, watery, pretty gross. Chili from a can perhaps? Chickeoodle soup was pretty darn good tho. nSometimes those dives have the best food we took our chances! Sorry we didn't have a burger instead.",1
"The food was pretty good. We ordered a bottle of wine, but we only received two glasses of wine. However, when we got the bill, they had charged us for a bottle. Despite this, we managed to have a decent time. nTheir pasta was quite oily and I found that the lack of variety in the menu was appalling for a restaurant of their calibre.",1
Excellent food that is worth the wait. Emphasis on wait. You will need to flag a waiter down repeatedly when they are busy but extremely good food best in the area. I play at this club and eat here every time I am in town. The sushi is the best I have had anywhere down south and they deserve the credit. They could use a better selection of craft beers.,2
"Golden brown pancakes, best pancakes in Vegas. Beats the pants off of chains like IHop and Denny's. I also had a side of chived smashed potatoes, also very good. Service was excellent. Warning They do not have sugar free syrup! I was eating here post workout, so I didn't mind having the simple sugar from their pure maple syrup. This is a great spot. Would make the drive to eat here again.",2
Twice a year we do a stay vacation at The Westin. For the past four years we have always ate here. The food is beautifully made its authentic Italian food! The strawberry tiramisu is to die for so yummy fresh strawberries. I could seriously eat three. We've always had good service. Spent New Years Eve as well it's a up scale mom and pop restaurant.,2
"Service has always been good. Food experience is sporadic, meaning it goes from ok to fair most of the time. Not overly impressed it's not the chili's of old. When their roots began with the trelingua tx chili cook off. The experience is fair at best and very seldom bad. Just not any thing more for me than a bar with fast food.",2
"In life, I don't think anything is perfect well.except perhaps the filet that I devoured at Arrowhead Grill may come pretty darn close! My experience was great from the beautiful and courteous hostess, great service, ambiance, wine and of course the main event my filet. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants a casual but fine dining experience. The food was superb!",2
I was just in this pharmacy that is supposedly 24 hours and told at 8 30pm they would be unable to do any scripts till 6am. Why are you a 24 hour pharmacy then? Also the woman who waited on me seemed irritated and disinterested in what she was doing. That does not make someone feel very comfortable that they may in some way be handling medication.,1
"This place is tiny, but what they manage to crank out of here is nothing short of a miracle. The staff is sweet, helpful and fun and I'd have to say this is my most favourite spot in all of Jean Talon Market. My personal favourite is the pecan pie OMFG Quebec maple, fresh pecans throughout and the flakiest, yummiest pastry on the planet sorry mum, but theirs is the best I have EVER had. ",2
Went here with my boss for lunch one day and was not impressed. We were seated in the back corner by the servers computers so they were constantly walking next to us. It was also very loud inside and I wish we could have sat outside. The food was just okay. Nothing special and nothing I would want again. I don't have any plans to return anytime soon.,1
I've played here quite a bit and it's really gone down hill. Last time I played the cart was filthy and had a big hole in the seat with tape over it. Played early on a Saturday to get done before the heat and they put groups off both sides to get more paid rounds in before the heat. Made the turn and it was horribly slow. Over 5 hour round and started at 7am. Greens were in horrible shape too.,1
You know when you see someone and they look really good and you think they are cool and want to hang out with them and halfway through your first conversation with them you realize that they really don't have a character and they are really nothing but looks? This is exactly what RA is for sushi. Lots of fanfare and no essence.,1
"I live a rather sedentary life, but occasionally honey dos take their toll. Judy's full body massage comes to the rescue and has me feeling great again. Other times, I'll get a massage to remove toxins or just get more movement in these old bones. I have used other therapists in the past, but Judy is the only one I would go to now. She's fabulous!",2
Tasty independent veggie friendly lunch spot close to downtown. Very impressive list of wraps. Fresh soup prepared daily. The only ticks against it are that parking can be a problem and it takes a long time for them to prepare the food around the lunch hour. My tip call your order in and pick it up.,2
"The bar is just ""okay "" but definitely wouldn't recommend it to all woman group or for a hangout place, more of a quick pit stop type place or if your in the neighborhood. The staff are a bunch a woman and not very friendly at all super snobby if you ask me . for what that's worth, the food is okay not the best not the worst, beers about 4 other alcoholic beverages about 7.",1
"Had the Lentil Soup and a Turkey Special without mayo they don't have low or no fat mayo or cheese. Soup was okay but not terrific. Sandwich was on mushy wheat bread. When they say ""heated "" it means your sandwich is zapped in the microwave. The deli meat leaves a lot to be desired. I get much better turkey from my grocery store. All in all a pretty ordinary experience.",1
"We have been here several times, since it is close to our church. The service is consistently slow and slack. Refills are slow and it seems to be an inconvenience for servers. Food is sometimes ok, sometimes just cold. You have other options, so take them. If all you want is a beer to watch the game, then it might be ok.",1
"This is the second time we have been to this denny's the first same thing happened. Burnt bacon, sausage and ham. This time it was worse. burnt bacon, sausage, ham, uncooked pancakes and watered down ice tea. Love denny's but never going to this one ever again. Got pictures of the food if i can post it here i will.",1
"I have stayed at the Nugget several times. This time I had a problem with the parking. I tried to valet my car and was told it was full. I went to self parking and was told it was also full. I asked where I should park and they told me "" you will have to find somewhere else "". If I am a guest at a hotel. They should have a parking spot for my car.",1
"Good little place in old town across from Cowboy Ciao. Had the turkey apple swiss wrap w dried cranberries,local greens, smoked bacon, and cashews. Very good and great size. The lady had the grilled chicken sage pesto sandwich w goat cheese, gala apple, and smoked bacon. She liked it as well. The sweet potato chips were very good too. will be back for sure.",2
"I seem to be having a very different experience than a lot of people. I have enjoyed the sushi, the cost is low, and the service has always been pretty prompt. Overall, after going here semi regularly since they have opened, I have found it better than many of the more trendy places in the valley. By no means the best in the world, but pretty solid.",2
"Went back second time.service so, so. Order mixed drink tall, came small. ordered chips with Guacamole.no Guacamole served.ordered plain chicken wings.no favor and not crisp like last time. Definitely need to work on consistency and more oversight by mgmt. Not at the top of my list for a return visit. One strike and you are out with me.",1
Terrible customer service and my drink tastes like crap infused drinkable chalk. Terrible customer service and my drink tastes like crap infused drinkable chalk. Terrible customer service and my drink tastes like crap infused drinkable chalk. Terrible customer service and my drink tastes like crap infused drinkable chalk.,1
"Beer was reasonably priced. The food was grade school cafeteria quality. The service was utterly terrible. If you can put up with the awful service, this isn't a bad place to hang out and have a drink or two before a Pirates game just don't expect to be waited on in a timely manner. But if you're looking for cheap, this is it.",1
"yes, yes, yes. It amazes me that it took someone so long to get it right. This cigar store bar is the future of all cigar stores. cigars, scotch, beer, multiple flat screens. very good selection of cigars great seating, nice events. The only thing i wish were different is I wish it was just a little bit larger, other than that it's the best cigar store in the east valley and probably phx.",2
"Dr. Sadre is fantastic. She pays attention to detail, is professional, and caring. I moved from out of state and was worried about finding a good dentist, but the staff immediately made me feel at home. They have even been able to squeeze me in for some dental emergencies. I recommend her to all my friends and would never go anywhere else.",2
"Ok, I'm all for dive bars. Places with a place to belly up and have a few. But c'mon, this place smelled a bit. Like someone took a leak in the corner. I showed up because of the Yelp reviews. Was looking for a place to kill some time playing pinball. Yeah, one drink of Ye Ole PBR and I was outta there. The pee smell was just too much.",1
"These things are delicious. We came both days that we were in Montreal during our last stay. There's quite a few different flavours, and they are in the 3 4 range. I think one per person is good for bfast. We shared a few different types and all were good. Tastes kind of like a cross between a croissant and a pretzel I'd say. Staff is friendly. Accepts credit",2
"One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. The strip steak was sooooo bad, I finally asked to have it taken away and removed from my bill after the kitchen made2 efforts to correct it. My wifes salmon was dry. I also found it very poorly managed had to walk among rows of extra chairs in the corridor which needed cleaning and a fresh coat of paint on my way to the restroom. DON'T BOTHER.",1
"Randomly chose to come there for a new haircut. I was ""randomly "" assigned to Terry, a very attentive hairdresser who simply did the best haircut I had in a while. And believe me, when it comes to hair, I'm picky! Will go back for sure, does not remember the exact price but does remember that if your budget is tight you should avoid.",2
We furnished almost an entire home from this beautiful store. Great designs and the owner is a pleasure to work with. There is absolutely no pressure to buy but I know you will find what you are looking for if you like modern and clean cut furniture. Delivery is wonderful. A wonderful shopping experience. Thank you Stefan!,2
"Wow. What a beautiful store. There really is no comparison when it comes to cigar shops in the Valley. Ambassador excels in just about every aspect. The best part of the experience is the personalized attention from Mr. Seferian, the stores owner. Mr. Seferian obviously cares deeply about his customers, and knows a great deal about cigars. Highly recommended.",2
I was craving a cheese steak and went to this place yesterday. One cheese steak was almost 10 bucks and I didn't get fries or anything with it maybe that was extra the meat in the sandwich tastes just like that frozen steakum crap you get at the grocery store and it was dripping with grease. Yuck! One of the guys behind the counter was kind of an ass too. I will never eat there again!,1
"I love dessert! This shop is so pretty. All the chocolates, pastries, and gelato are on full display. The strawberry gelato is fantastic creamy, flavorful, and not too sweet. The chocolate covered strawberries are also really good. The fruit is really ripe and delicious, and the quality of chocolate is nice. I would definitely stop by again!",2
This is a Las Vegas favorite that has been publicized and pretty well overrated. One of the only things really worth having is their sangria beyond that I like their fries and that would be it. Service isn't much to really rave about. It's always packed with annoying college kids and has so much bad rep when it comes to health code violations you will always worry about it every time you go.,1
"Central is now serving their Cold Brew Coffee on tap. That's right, boys and girls. Get your coffee over ice, in a pint glass or to go, straight from the draught built into the bar. Also, the updated menu board is gorgeous. Can't wait to see it when it's finished. And there was much rejoicing throughout the land.",2
"It's 9pm on a wednesday night, I just landed from San Francisco and I hadn't slept the night before. nI need sustenance. Prime rib for 11.99? Sure why not. nI just wish I had fresh horseradish. Also, a little more attention from the waitress would've beeice. The place was EMPTY. The prime rib was annihilated.",1
"Way too much hype for this place! And expensive too! I ordered a latte and five macarons.it costed me 13! The latte I could've gotten better at Starbucks and the macarons had that old refrigerator smell I was really disappointed. Everything looked great, but everything tasted below average. Save yourself the money and disappointment",1
Love love LOVE this place! My boyfriend and I eat here almost every week! Super cute old house with lots of seating inside and out. Have never had a bad meal here. My favorite sandwich is the Doc's choice. It comes on an awesome pretzel roll. You can buy all kinds of local art and listen to some great live music. GREAT COFFEE! I LOVE YOU HOB NOBS!,2
"Very clean, fast and friendly service with amazing Pho and Spring Rolls. This place was busy on a Sunday afternoon at 2 00pm, so something tells me this Vietnamese Restaurant is legit. We just moved into the area and I'm already assuming this place will become my ""go to "" Asian restaurant. Very good experience! Overall Experience A nFood A nService B nAtmosphere A nAmbiance B",2
Let me just start by saying that I work at another jimmy johns location so I fully understand how things work here! A few weeks ago my boyfriend got hair in his sandwich. Gross. Today we tried it again and I ordered my sandwich with avocado. No avocado was on the sandwich. We called the store for a refund and the guy was a dick. Joked about giving us our money back. Will not return,1
"YUM! We ordered the pad thai and BBQ Chicken lunch special, duck over rice lunch special and seafood soup. It was GOOD! I liked the pad thai and the soup but the BBQ Chicken wasn't as good as my friend had raved. Perhaps they over cooked it this time and it was a bit on the dry side. A definite pleasant surprise find in Vegas.a bit off the strip on the ghetto side of Vegas 10 minute drive .",2
"I don't care how good the burgers are. The background music is blaring so loud I my husband had a hard time talking to each other. The restaurant is so loud because everyone else has to talk over the music too! When I say loud I mean ""clubbing "" loud! Oh, I'm not some old person complaining either. I'm in my 30's. I actually got a nasty headache just waiting on my burger. Nice!",1
"I like the atmosphere at Blanco, but I really wasn't impressed by the food. I had the ahi tacos and for 13, I could have had a better tacos at a local hole in the wall mexican joint. If you're looking to start your night off with drinks before hitting the town id recommend. 50 for two entrees and two draft beers, no thanks.",1
"I order here a lot. They always get my order right, AND find my house. Not an easy task. n The pizza is good, never burnt or gooey, and I order online, they are nice if I need to call, but usually I don't. n They don't offer red peppers or Parmesan Cheese anymore, which makes me a sad panda. n All in all, glad they are nearby, and fast.",2
"I stumbled in her for dinner one night and brought an out of town guest, the service was incredible and the food was good but if you are looking for upper scale steer clear. My husband and I have since been back. once again, good service. good food. This is where I first met Shawn Johnson who is an amazing musician, I will go back. LOVE the back patio with a bar and smoking available.",2
"we LOVE this place! Super friendly atmosphere, excellent food. No joke, my wife and I have been there over 20 times, and have never once had a meal we didn't like. The owner, John and his wife Ha, are very nice people, and John gives us the best reccomendations. The prices are fair, and the tastes are amazing. You can't go wrong for great Vietnamese food in Arizona.",2
"Maybe I'm the fool but I still don't see what the any of the talk is about the Salt Cellar. Mind you, I'm not comparing it to other seafood restaurants in the valley. I'm comparing it to other seafood restaurants period. There is nothing about the Salt Cellar that have ever stood out for me, except the price and I don't find this place worth the cost. I'd go elsewhere.",1
"I'm giving up. While the food is very good, they NEVER get the to go orders correct! We live close by and have always picked up our food to go. Every single time and that is not an exaggeration something was wrong with the order and we either had to run back to the store or settle on what they gave us. It's just too frustrating to continue eating here.",1
"If you want to go and be over charged, or you like the switch and bait plan then this is the store for you. When I called and asked about their prices they stated ""our prices are the same as refilling your ink cartridge "" BUT when I got there they wanted to charge me 1.oo less than retail. Order your ink on line, ALOT cheaper.",1
I've been getting my eyebrows waxed since I was 16. I went here because I just moved in the area and my normal salon is really out of the way. It was the most painful and rushed wax I ever had and they came out horrible. I will definitely never come here again I will gladly drive 45 minutes out of my way to my normal nail shop.,1
"We were here last night and bought some cupcakes. They were dry, not all that yummy, and 2 cost 9 dollars. Seriously disappointed with this experience because I have heard and seen so much about this place and was really thinking it was going to be awesome. Maybe the candy is better but Im not much of a candy person, I like my cake.",1
"The food taste subpar, it's an all you can eat place but it seems like the owners get angry when you order more then what they think you should be getting for the money you paid, does not feel like a friendly place, don't think I'll be going here ever again even thou its a 5 min. ride from my house.",1
I just don't know about this place. nWe had to wait for a table for an hour and a half. Menu deceiving oven roasted beets? They were cold! Steak listed on a bed of mashed potatoes and we got maybe a tablespoons worth. Waiter was not attentive. Manager not very accommodating but did offer a side of mashed potatoes. Not sure if we will return?,1
"We have been here a few times for food and beer. The service here has been consistently good, especially for a tourist strip place. The beer selection could be a bit broader but is satisfactory. We have tried several items on the menu, my wife likes the hush puppies, and everything has been good each time, again unusual for the casual dining places on the strip.",2
This place was great. The wings were the best I had and the pizza had the most stretchy cheese. Always best eaten hot and never warm. I also liked the rice dishes. You won't be disappointed. The environment is more of an urban and youth theme. I really enjoy listening to the pop and kpop while enjoying my meal. The art was also nice too. A great place with friends and maybe dates ,2
Another great brewery in Charlotte that we found out about recently. The place is a decent size and large enough where you don't feel cramped with the neighboring tables. The beer here is very good. My current favorite is the Smoked Amber but I will have to come back again to try the rest. This place is great bec I would rather pop in for a drink here and support local great tasting beer.,2
"Woochee has great price for all you can eat, 12.99 for lunch. I love their meat, seafood and side dishes selection! I also appreciate that the servers come around to change the grill when it gets filthy. The only downfall that I have is that Woochee is very small with low ceilings that as soon as you get out of the restaurant, you smell like Korean BBQ.but worth the price and quality!",2
"Reserved a table for a birthday. Got to the venue, they had no idea who we were neither a table ready Food was ok, Rum was great. Note they do not split bills and charge you 2 per plate if you bring a birthday they almost refused allowing us to eat the cake in the restaurant incase it ""contaminated "" their food?",1
"A decent place to have a drink while watching a game. The food, however, was not impressive. The artichoke crab dip was awful. The veggie quesadillas were ok. The waiter ignored us for a long time, and when the manager walked by, he coughed on our table. There's bound to be better places in the area.",1
"Been here twice now and have not been let down. My friends and I made sure to order different things and share to get the most for our money. I like the daily specials the most, I had the garlic chicken w miso mayonnaise and the seared furikaki ahi and both were as we say back in Hawaii ""broke da mouth "". The location is inconvenient but worth the drive. YUMMY!",2
"I didn't have beavertails at this particular stand, but I can't find the name of the stand I did have it in inside the Complex Desjardins . Fried dough with nutella or maple butter sounds great, and I was pretty excited for it, but it just tasted like warm, thin whole wheat bread with far too much maple butter and chocolate drizzled on top. I agree with Kat T., far too sweet for adults.",1
"Saturday night at this Irish tavern is okay, the house band is good. The food is acceptable. There's a good vibe and the Tavern's loud but not too loud. I don't love the place nor do I hate Hennessey's it's just very okay. It's an ideal 2 and a half star experience on Freemont. The Gunniess Bloody Mary thing left much to be desired.",1
I love this museum. The architecture is gorgeous. They have great collections. My girlfriend and I went to see the Modern Mexican exhibit last Wednesday when admission was free. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was my third visit to PAM and I always leave feeling energized and inspired. I highly recommend it.,2
"SO glad these guys found a bigger location than their old one! Lots of seating, an espresso regular bar, pool table.awesome. I always go for the chicken philly and its always delicious. Just the right amount of cheese melted into the chicken and placed on the softest grinder roll imaginable. PSC always hits the spot!",2
"Imagine having one of the best meals of your life. This is what it's like at Joel Robuchon the mansion. 16 courses.wine.almost 1k spent.totally worth it! This along with L'atelier, opened next door are the first 2 restaurants that he has ever opened in the United States. It's definitely something that you must experience at least once in your life. Well.maybe twice.",2
Honey pig for the first time trying to get my Korean BBQ fix. This is a nice small restaurant with great friendly staff. Our waitress was very helpful helped us pick out our meal. The marinated short ribs and bulgogi was awesome! Plus we got to cook ourselves so it was a fun experience. I will be back for sure.,2
Overall I really enjoyed the Rio and i would recommend it to anyone. Pro nReasonable room prices. nGreat casino. low limit table games nGreat Buffets especially the 24 hour pass nFree Shuttles nBig rooms Cons nOff the strip. nCHIECK IN nWiFi .we had to call tech support Things to know. nCheck in can take an hour at peak times. nThey use keurig coffee machines in the room.bring your own k cups.,2
"What a pathetic food. we went here to celebrate birthday. Ordered biriyani, which is so tasteless not even worth of touching it. There chilli chicken is one of the worst I ever had in my life. We were there before, but looks like it's a rapidly going down. I should say this is the worst food ever tasted in a while. Watch out if you want to venture out into this place.",1
"I would put no stars. Right before my wedding I bought a special online. I pre cleaned for the ""crew "" and no one showed up. I called the owner and he scrambled to send out someone. The person who came did a terrible job. My husband couldn't tell if anyone showed up until we found a wet mop drying in a guest room. Do not use this company!",1
"Deceptive sales practices! Buyer beware! The sales guy sells you that if you buy a detail package for 89, he will throw in three free car washes but really you only get two. One is counted when you get the detail. Ok. It was bothering me, so I went in and asked for a refund for the detail and they made it right by giving me a free coupon for a works wash.",1
This is the worst McDonald's I've been to. The service is always horrible. The only reason I ever go there is because it's the closest location to my home. Also it's obvious that the management is to blame. The workers are lazy and have no manners never say thank you. I don't usually write bad reviews but people need to know not to go here and this will be my last time too.,1
"We went here for lunch during restaurant week and I couldn't be more excited! We had a perfect table near the window overlooking the Bellagio, the pre fix menu was an app, steak and dessert. I'm not a steak eater but it was cooked to perfection, and the peach tart with basil ice cream was delicious. Service was excellent. I can't wait to come back try dinner, the views will be just as good.",2
"The tower of pancakes. A perfect counter to the six Absolut Mandarin and tonics I have just consumed at Haze, the night club. Nice to go mano to mano with sausage, eggs, bacon, and buttermilk flapjacks at 2 00 in the morning.Best use of a winning ticket ever, but you have to be up 13 dollars to play at this table.",2
"I had less than a month to rid myself of 35 years of accumulated possessions and was in quite a tizzy. Thank goodness I found Norbert! He was my life saver. He told me not to worry, he would take care of everything and he did. Once he stepped in my life became much less stressful and I was able to concentrate on my cross country move.",2
LIQUID CRACK. The coffee here is really good and the owner was once an air traffic controller. He reads books on quantum physics for fun! At some point he quit his job and came up with a patented roasting technique and voila fanfriggingtastic coffee. Last time I was there they had a FreeBSD machine as a kiosk and Internet connectivity. Not sure if there is wi fi or not.,2
"I would give Tao zero stars except it deserves credit for being a really cool looking place. The food is mediocre, insanely salty, and totally overpriced. The sushi is not on par with any good sushi restaurant in LA or Vegas, and the rest of the menu is like Katana's. The service is horrendous and the attitude is a joke.",1
"I would not advise anyone using a restaurant.com certificate to use at this place. I tried to use one and was told they would not honor it for the items that I wanted even though there are no printed restrictions. I have been there many times, with great results, but never again. And I will tell everyone I know.",1
This place is awful I take my daughter here for Ortho and she z it to the point that she leaves crying every time . They are very rude and disrespectful and very unprofessional. My problem is that I Already paid more than half the money and have no choice now. I would never recommend this place to anyone.,1
It's jack in the box so you know what to expect but this is one of the few jack in the box locations that is not stingy at all with the condiments. I ordered a snack box and asked for ranch you can put ranch on almost anything at jack I got 5 containers of it. Don't mind me just getting excited over ranch.,2
"This place and service is terrible. The facility itself was dirty, the tables were not wiped down people were literally standing waiting for their orders to takeout.the racks in the back were empty the staff were clueless as to what was going on.I didnt see a manager anywhere, I did wait on my order as it was already 715. The meal was horrible.I will go elsewhere and it wont be KFC ",1
"This place is ieed of a good manager. Beer on tap was flat, 2 types, food was below average. They ran out of wine glasses when the place was half full. We saw drinks on the bar sit for ten minutes waiting to be taken to a table. The Sloppy Joe was terrible, giant hard bun with 2 scoops of meat, barely a meal. We have had enough, there are better places to go.",1
"They need to change the oil, fries both regular and greek came out brown and well done. Everything was bland. Greek salad tasted like nothing. Calamari fried in old oil as well. Gyro sandwich was bland too. Beer selection limited. I'm not sure how this place is still running? Service was outstanding but we will never go back.",1
"Despite some of their first facebook reviews on the day of vegas streets, i think Muncheeze is delish! Their tomato soup defines what comfort food is. i can eat this stuff every day! YUMMMM. We took everything to go, the Piggy Mac was so good, it reminded me of the Pulled Porky Slider. Try it! If you love Slidin Thru and their quality of food, you wont be disappointed with Muncheeze!.",2
"Great atmosphere, awesome patio. Went on a Friday night. The food was great. The ceviche was enough for a meal, and very tasty! 4 stars only due to the long wait and my food being done the wrong way, but was corrected VERY quickly. Oh and if you like Tequila I don't this place is a must for you! nI have been here for Sunday brunch and that was spectacular!",2
"Went expecting a nice Sunday brunch, very disappointing. Mimosas were premixed. They had no champagne on premises. Felt like they were 99.9 percent orange juice. Entree , eggs Benedict, did not include any side dishes. Also had a sweet taste. Actually went home hungry and thirsty. Not a good breakfast spot.",1
"This place is brand new and competes with prices at other salons nearby. It's the only 24 tanning salon in the area and it has a kids area for moms to let the little ones play while you tan. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of music, which I'm use to when I tan. The beds are all very nice and the owners are very nice and accomodating. I believe they're hiring as well ",2
Are you in the mood for Chipotle? Would you like to pay twice as much for half as much food? This is the place for you! It is absolutely not worth the price. Chips and queso are 3.25 for a single serving. To go dishes are NOT microwave safe found out the hard way . At 8 pm I had to check the hours of operation because staff treated me like I was bothering them after hours. Save your money.,1
"It's tough to find breakfast in Vegas, but this is a good spot if you're staying at Caesars. The crepes were tasty, and they have premade yogurt parfaits and stuff if you just want to go cheap and fast. It's right across from Rao's. There was a conference going on and the line got pretty long, so plan ahead for your time.",2
"I absoulutely love shopping here! Everytime i walk in im greeted, but not in a pushy sales way. Everyone is so nice and the inventory is gorgeous! Its a clean store and they always have a sale wall which is nice because Micheal Kors is not ALWAYS in everyones budget. Will be back soon for my next purse! I wish i could work here!",2
"As someone who listens to Vampire Weekend, I crave falafel and let me tell you this place is delicious. I got the falafel sandwich and it by far exceeded expectations. The place in general might seem a bit dated they won some award for being the best at something in 1998 but if you are hungry for mediterranean food and you are in the area Akropolis will hit the spot.",2
"Customer Service is horrible.that is.if you can even get ahold of an agent over the phone. I left a message several times for a can replacement.no return phone call. Have sat on the phone , waiting for an agent to take the call several times. The drivers are great and this is the reason I provide 1 star. Otherwise, their customer service agents are worthless and they deserve no accolades.",1
"Totally unimpressed with this place. The bread was dry and fell apart as I was eating it.I wonder how old it was.the cheese was sliced so thin you would hardly taste it, the girl behind the counter went CRAZY with the mustard and the bread was still dry enough to crumble , None of the veggies had any flavor. Will definitely not get a port of subs sandwich again.",1
"The service here is truly outstanding. The only ""bad "" thing is that it can get pretty busy and since they give each customer's tires lots of individual TLC, the wait time can get a bit long at busy times. The good news is that you can plan ahead by scheduling an appointment on their website to drastically reduce your waiting. I would highly recommend coming here for any tire needs.",2
"So to be honest I dont really know a lot about comic books, but coming here I didn't feel like I was being judged on that. The owner was super friendly and very helpful. He seems to know a lot about basically anything you're interested in. Extremely friendly, and compared to the one other comic book store I've been in this one has an amazing selection.",2
"The sportsbook at silverton is very nice. Better odds on parlays as well. It's not a very big sportsbook, but done very well. Screens are large and crystal clear. Ample seating if you take up a spot at a slot machine. Sunday football crowd is quite subdued compared to other books around town. No ones really loud n rowdy. My new favorite sportsbook in Vegas.",2
"We just discovered this place and loved it! I had the enchilada deluxe with ground beef and green sauce and my boyfriend had a carne asada burrito. Their food is just great and the staff very friendly. I enjoy coming here once a week, if you go on a Friday they have live music playing. It's very very nice and I recommend it to anyone looking for great Mexican food.",2
"Came here only because my friends were already booked here. Staff was alright some of the OLDER card dealers need to smile.jeez. If you don't like your job go somewhere else! We had to ask our room to be clean, if we didn't come back in the afternoon they would of just left it as is. You do get what you pay for.BUT would you want your customers to come back.",1
"Uh. No. If I wanted to hang out on campus and be eyeballed by frat boys looking for a fight, I'd go to Joe's or some other place like that. The food sucks. I don't drink anything but beer, so that's okay. Not my kind of place, and that is not Guido's fault. Verified family man just heading out for a cold beer that's all.",1
It may just me but I think Red Robin has gone down hill. I used to love to get me a good burger at this location. Not so much anymore. Service was slow and fries were old and overcooked. Only reason I go there still is because my kids like it. But each time I go I get more and more against the idea of going there again.,1
"Came here the first time and they recommended the beach house and the br u00fbl u00e9e. Went with the br u00fbl u00e9e and it was really good. Worth it for 7. Came here for a second time and tried the beach house. SOO different, but it's still a solid choice nonetheless. Cons The baskets, chairs and tables need to be better cleaned. I got unlucky and got some sticky residue on some furniture.",2
I came here with my family and it was such an amazing experience. The chef is very talented and it's such a relief to have a delicious authentic Japanese restaurant in Henderson! The seafood is very fresh and I recommend the homemade tofu and the Kobe beef carpaccio. Will definitely come here often.,2
"I picked up a half dozen cupcakes at Mind over Batter to share with some friends. The cupcakes were moist and delicious. I had not been in before and randomly selected six that looked great. The store is super cute and the staff is very friendly. The cupcakes run around 4 a piece, a half dozen set me back 21.25.",2
"If it had been possible to give zero stars, I would have. nordered their hand made pan pizza. Complete and utter rubbish. Raw uncooked dough in the middle. Bland, boring and pathetic toppings. VItos is close. Momma Spinnys is close. Why did I fall for the advert and believe Dominoes might, possibly, produce an edible pizza",1
Dive is a boutique in Scottsdale dedicated completely to women who are size 14 and up. I think it's really cool that they offer a stylish store for women who usually can't find many stylish things in their size. Although the main display is a moo moo.not the most technically stylish thing in the world. Inside there are all different designs and styles!,2
"Both my daughter and I got to spend a fun filled Sunday sick to our stomachs, retching, plus all the highlights that go along with it. Interestingly enough, Saturday night, we both had bean and cheese burritos with guacamole here. I'm not saying we got food poisoning from Filiberto's, but it is definitely suspect.",1
"Extreme hole In the wall very easy to pass by. With that said, it's amazingly good. I recommend getting the mulas and the cemitas. Very fresh quick and flavorful. And if you are anal about cleanliness it too is also. Give it a try you won't be regret it. Oh and by the way the tortas and cemitas use fresh bread baked daily, I beleive they get it from the Mexican bakery next door.",2
"Very outdated and appeared very isolated when it came to patrons despite the busy lobby. I booked a corner room suite and it felt like an oversized studio. actually a huge studio! I was not happy at all with the layout and when I waited for my friend to come and go, I kept the door propped open, it was so quiet. almost too quiet and the atmosphere was eery! I would not stay there again.",1
"The hookah there is really not that good, the regular flavors taste awful, the hookahs don't let a good enough draw and they use quick light charcoals, even on the premium hookah. They do not carry Al Fakher tobacco, the premium they sell is Star Buzz which taste like candy. Nice curtains and deco though, and kudos for the Turkish coffee, which ups it to 2 stars.",1
Sooooooooo. We came tonight from Money Play. It was crazy there and we couldn't get service. The bar here wasn't as swamped and the drinks were the right price! 3.75 for a Cuervo silver and oj! But the food. We got 40 wings and a side of fries. It came to 31.00. Everything was so yummy! Diana the server was really great. She helped us a lot!.,2
"Beautiful decoration, BAD service, OVER RATED price. 60 for 2 people. What a rip off! Hah Gow was 8 for 4 pieces. I could have gone to Dim Sum and had it with 16 pieces. Hai nan chicken rice was 18 which my God dad made it better than them. Every main course was 18 at least. Never had such expensive CHINESE food. It would be my first time and last time also.",1
Just get the Mac N Cheese with broccoli and chicken in it. 'Nuff said! I love this place and their food! Drink specials are awesome too. Fav dirty martini is at Bar Louie! yummmmm! Def check it out people. Sometimes they have a live band too. They're pretty good! Mac N Cheese disappointment the cheese is on recall so they aren't making it now just take it off the menu to save me the sadness. Ugh!,1
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was beautiful and very clean. Breakfast was awesome with many choices. We booked on a Friday using government rate and got a great deal we are traveling on orders . I highly recommend the hotel. The pool was large, laundry facilities and small workout room. No complaints!",2
"My Wife and I spent 4 days, 3 nights. Room was nice and quiet. Casino was average. The staff, for the most part was courteous, with the exception of the Helpdesk attendant who was rude when we needed help connecting to WiFi. I would rather spend my time and money at the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay, the are MUCH nicer. Won't be back. It's no worth it.",1
"I'm opposed Mongolian grills in general, but Flat Top is the better of the available options. If you go for lunch, it's actually a good deal dinner is exactly the same except for more money . The breakfast option is a nice twist add lots of crap to your pancakes or scrambled eggs . Two stars since I'll never actually WANT to go there, though I'll be willing to go if friends really want to.",1
"I'm guessing they turned this place around again, based on previous reviews. We went here the other morning and it was great. Awesome, friendly barista, and a good atmosphere overall. Nice places to sit both inside and outside. I think the most awesome part is they serve Almond Milk! Woohoo! My Veggie Panini was as delicious as described, and the coffee was just shy of perfect.",2
"This place was totally delish! What I love about the MGM is that I think they really do have the best selection of restaurants available. This place did not disappoint. Our server was very very very attentive. I ordered the beef carpaccio and some raviolini super yum, and I sampled the crab cakes I think the carpaccio was better . Great place to dine highly recommended.",2
"Food is decent enough especially for the price but they RUSH customers out the door, not in a rude way, it actually shows they're being attentive. As soon as you're done eating, like within 30 seconds they ask if they can get you anything else before presenting the check. The rushing is actually a plus because as busy as they get, you never have to wait for a table",2
"Loved my 50 min facial and my family enjoyed their massages as well. It's such a nice, soothing environment and my specialist let me relax and didn't banter and chatter. I'd suggest you get there ahead and relax in the personal jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, shower and THEN do your facial and massage so you can leave all the lotion and oil absorbed in your skin.",2
"I love this Italian restaurant. The speed and quality of the food is great. I'm a fan of Rigatony's for life. With exception to their salads, it's better than Olive Garden but not nearly as upscale as Cafe Boa. Good stuff. They offer authentic Italian dishes that are favorites. You won't be let down.",2
Ok. First and foremost. View is good. Wine list is poor. Service was average. Lobster bisque burnt. Salad had no dressing. So on Marche baccus next door is miles ahead for wine and food selectio noverall food was average. We eat at a lot of 4 5 star restuarants. Sorry. Can't give this more than 2. Maybe as time moves on it will get better,1
"Food is okay, but the first and only time I was ever in this location I was glared at and the only thing the guy said to me the whole time I was in there was ""are you ready or what? "" And when I said thank you after he handed me my sub he continued to just stare and not say a word. Terrible customer service at this location",1
"Complete ripoff. 5 shots of vodka in a 50 oz container of sugar water for 32 bucks. I actually only saw the bartender pour 4 shots, so not sure it was even the 5 they claim. We tossed it out half way thru, it was so bad. No kick, and sure as hell isn't going to get you NUMB. Total false advertising. If you want to be a winning product, need to make your drinks stronger. They were so weak.",1
We came here last year for my birthday in Vegas. We came for the experience of course because the food was not that great. They truly WERE dicks! They seated us and and called some of us names! Made us hats and it all had something rude or obnoxious written on it! It was for pure fun! Interesting experience but the food was okay.,1
"Once upon a time, this was one of my favorite coffee shops. Honestly, I don't know what's happened. You walk in and the baristas stare at you like you're an inconvenience. Sorry guys, I need my caffeine fix. Too bad the espresso tastes watered down and stale. The bakery is overpriced and again stale. Tables are cramped and the wi fi is terrible. I don't expect much but I expect something.",1
"This is the BEST Massage and Chiropractic place I have ever been to and I have had many Chiropractors and Massage Therapists. All of the therapists are really amazing and in the last 7 months of going almost every week, I have never had a massage that didn't either relax or work those muscles. I am so impressed. My place for a lifetime!",2
"Very good barber shop. Eric and rob hook me up and do real good. I'll go with either one is free first. I'm sure the whole staff is good. Don't go weekend afternoons, I have had to wait for a hour for a haircut a few times I been there, and they don't do appointments. Best barber shop I been to that's why there so busy on weekend.",2
"One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.period! The gyro rice bowl is out of this world with the rice, Israeli salad, gyro meat tasty tzaziki sauce! nI've had Mediterranean food many times before, but all that I have tried at Stephano's has been delicious. And for the price.you can't beat it! They even have a groupon sometimes so make sure to check in on Yelp for deals with groupon! nYummy!",2
"Went here again over weekend. Food slightly better, table servers are kind of creepy and untrustworthy. Don't leave your purse here, you wont get it back. Bar is nice, the girls are almost always great. BEWARE, some items on the menu, both food and at the bar, are EXTREMELY expensive, read well before you buy. Not likely to ever return.",1
"Awful. Just awful. Rude management. No butter, but they didn't tell you. You wouldn't know till you tasted it. All they said was sorry we ran out after, waiting in line again to ask why when we specifically asked for EXTRA butter. The manager had an attitude and wasn't helpful, she didn't even smile.",1
"Capriotti's is just not for me. I have tried the Bobbie twice, it is just not that interesting. Thanksgiving is once a year for a reason. Plus having this as a random sandwich shop is much too heavy from a deli. It just doesn't make since to me. Nothing else looked or sounded appealing either. After 3 visits, Capriotti's is not a stop for me.",1
"Would never stay here again. No mini fridge, no ice machine so were forced to by their 14 dollars drinks, gym pass 25 for one day, their spice buffet was overpriced and bland, the pool sucked ass, it was basically a lot of concrete with two olympic pools! If I had money to throw away I would never spend any money on a so called cabana! Worst experience ever!",1
"I'm always looking for fresh and healthy food so I stop by, their customer service was bad! It was my first time and I had a lot question they didn't care and rush me to order my food when I finally got my food, it was unflavored! Food tasted like nothing, the smoothis was way too sweet for me. This place was just not for me. I'll probably try it another time.",1
"Great salon, nice, white, open and contemporary. All of the stylists here rent their spots so you should search out your own stylist, or Mosaic can help you find someone for your specific needs. I would highly recommend Michelle T, she does an amazing job on both cuts and colors for men and women, and I have seen her up dos for weddings and they look amazing.",2
"I have made numerous meat purchases from Larry's and been very happy with the quality, service and price. For the 4th of July I ordered a whole pig from Larry's. To my surprise, I received a phone call on July 2nd to remind me to pick up the pig. When I got there I was again surprised that the pig was cheaper than they had originally quoted. I will certainly continue my patronage with Larry's!",2
"I took my car to several places to sell it, and they did give me the fairest price. But, after I signed all the paper they told me the check wouldn't go through for 2 days. 5 days later, still no money! I call them and THEN they tell me that no, it takes ten days to get the money. I will not sell to them again!",1
"I proudly demolished almost an entire margherita pizza from Federal the other night and don't regret a single bite. Decent beer selection, great service, crowded but pleasant atmosphere, and a creative pizza menu. On Mondays and Tuesdays Federal offers a pizza, 2 pitchers of beer or 1 carafe of wine for 20.",2
"Went there yesterday for lunch. Wanted to sit outside however there were so many flies. Not appealing while eating. Also, we then decided to get it to go and we never received our order of fries after we did pay for them. Realized after we got home. Bacon was also really fatty on chicken club. Poppers and mozzarella sticks were good though. Do not order a salad, they're cheap on the lettuce!",1
"Very disappointed with service! I've been in there a couple of times, love the food, but the little jerks they hired are horrible. Brad to be exact, was more interested in trying to sell me every desert then getting my order right. I would to love support Capriotti's Phoenix but not if i'm going to spend my hard earned money on something i didnt order and bad service!",1
"this place is awful. completely unprofessional and will never do business with big two again. i would strongly advise you to do the same. to sum up my experience in a nutshell, i was called a ""liar "" and big two never admitted any wrong doing. i wish i could tell you all more but cannot due to personal reasons. i am an educated person and this place is a travesty stay away!",1
"We had to bus our own table. After asking for someone to take our order like 10 times, they did only to tell us after we asked where our drinks were 45 min later our order wasn't entered because they are too busy. ""Sorry, there is nothing I can do. "" We left with nothing after sitting here for an hour and a half. Worst service and business management EVER.",1
"I read the older reviews that thought it was way overpriced at 18. Well now it is up to 30 and still way overpriced. Went during the day and lots of animals were hiding in the shade as we should have been. Didn't see much! My advice is to go at night to see all the lights and not the animals, maybe then it would be worth the 30. Go to the NC zoo, now that's a 5 star and much less than 30.",1
"Shaina was so awesome and friendly. She made sure to ask me all the questions to find out exactly what shape I wanted and how I wanted my brows to look, she even tinted twice to get to the exact color I wanted! My eyebrows are hard to get symmetrical and even and she did so good, took her time and paid attention to detail.",2
" Cash Only 5 for link removal! I was in and out of this place in literally 2 minutes! Trust me, I timed it on my new chronograph watch I was getting sized. I Yelped watch repair places in my local area, and found some options closer to me. However, this place has 4.5 stars, and it held true to its rating. I will be bringing all of my future online watch purchases to this place to be sized.",2
"I'd thought I would suffer from plate lunch withdrawals when I moved to LV. Island Flavor hits da spot! Proper local style food from Big Island transferred folks. All the other ""local Hawaiian food "" themed food taste like crappy L L. Yeah there is a clear difference betweeon Hawaii raised people trying to make Hawaii style plate lunch food.",2
"This group of people are the absolute worst. If you have them I recommend ditching them, if you are thinking about it go somewhere else for service if you can. Seems as though they like our money and despise the customer. I hope google brings ISP to Phoenix area, and these guys are choked out of the market.",1
"The Paper Place on Marshall Way is a great spot for finding the perfect stationary or designing an invitation for an upcoming event. They have lots of little gift ideas that are perfect finds for hostess gifts for anytime of year, as well as beautiful Filo Fax binders and supplies for your 2008 time management organizational needs.",2
"An art performance studio AND music venue All Ages as they regretfully have no liquor license focusing on regional creativity and the occasional national touring act. The interior is beautiful, extremely intimate and the PA sound is great. Unfortunately I find the booking to be based around MySpace bands . lots of children who mostly are friends of the young bands playing and sadly zero liquor .",1
Horrible stay! Never again one of the rooms gave my sister a nasty rash. Got charge with room damage for something that was broken already! And for that we got kicked out and when we tried to talk to a manager about it we were escorted by officers to leave we couldn't even leave a complain. I don't recommend it!,1
"Pizza Palermo is great! It's priced well, service is awesome, employees are friendly, the pizza is always really good, they have a wide delivery range, and it's always FAST. I think they overestimate their delivery time on purpose. The operating hours are great too. No need for a long review here.it's just a good pizza shop.",2
"Very cozy and romantic environment, with a great view of the fountains. For the price and the quality taste of the food, it was just A OK. Service was ok, and the food was good, but did not blow me away. The souffle was just ok as well, which is disappointing. Well, had extraordinary food for the same amount of price or less in the Bay Area, so probably would not revisit again, thus the 2 stars.",1
"Stumbled through here during an Art Festival that was out in the street. Went right for the adjoining espresso bar YES! YES! YES! They got it. Quality coffee, they care, the barista's are into it. They just needed one more person out infront on the counter keeping things clean and shiny and they'd have that 5th star.",2
"Absolutely pleased with this place. Very nice family owned restaurant. Clean, simple and inviting. Killer menu! Authentic Japanese items and some others. Never have to wait long for food. Accommodating as I've ever seen! The woman even pulled out an extra chair for our baby carrier! I love going to this place!",2
"Traci, the owner is amazing! She's very proffesional and friendly. Her services are great and a must try for those who have not had an organic mani pedi before! She also carried soy candles, and organic childrens nail polish. That I did buy for my little girl. drys quick and no harmful chemicals. The shop is very calming and a place you can sit back enjoy and relax!",2
"This was my first experience with reflexology, and for 25 10 off Mon Thurs ,I was super pleased. I skipped the foot soak since I had come over from the nail salon but the massage part lasted for an hour and put me right to sleep. Comfortable chairs, dark and soothing music. The massage chairs were a bit too rough for me but that could just be me. Absolutely worth the money.",2
"What a great steakhouse with class! The manager Roxanne was so polite and really CARED about our dining experience. The Prime steak and shrimp were excellent. We loved the REAL caesar dressing on our salad! We had EXCELLENT service from Julio! If your looking for a first class dining experience, this is the place.",2
"This place has the worst service inside! The pick up time for the drive thru drop off is 3pm. Who drops off mail at 3? If the place were truly accommodating, it would have a later last drop off time. The people inside are just rude! They are not helpful when it comes to packages. FYI bring your own tape because the people behind the corner will not give you any.",1
"I love the Dunkachino, but not this Dunkin donuts. Every time I go they charge me a different amount for the medium Dunkachino, sonetimes it's 2.53, 2.48, or 2.17. I don't get it, it's not a lot of money but I feel like the employees are stealing. The Dunkachino isn't even on their menu. The Dunkin donuts on the Las Vegas strip going south and the one on Bermuda both charge a 1.93 so what gives.",1
"Best Buy has always been one of my favorite place to go. I usually already know what I want before I arrive. So I never had a issue of needing service. But if I did! Then I would find someone to ask! I have always believed that electronics are over priced, so I wish they can lower some of their items a little more! Overall this is a good place to go!",2
Stopped by for dessert and coffee last night. We were told it would be a 20 min wait. We looked around the shop and then waited by the bar. After 45 min and seeing groups walk in and be seated and groups that arrived after us be seated we left. Horrible customer service! We went to Serendipity 3 and had a great time. I would not waste my time with The Sugar Factory!,1
"What a disappointment. The people who gave this place good reviews must've been super drunk. The ""secret "" thing about it is unique. But that was the only thing kind of cool about it. We waited in a long line for mediocre pizza and subpar service. There was nowhere to sit and two pinball machines taking up half the tiny pizza shop. In the end, our deal breaker was the NO RANCH policy.",1
"Love the location, could walk home if we had too! Used to eat there on Fridays all the time. Happy hour rocked. Not anymore. Last time we were there, food was really bad! I ordered a fish sandwich and it was just a pile of mush. Prices used to be decent, but not so much anymore. We will still stop in on the weekend for a Bloody Mary, but not to eat.",1
"We had heard that you can't visit Montreal without trying frites, and this was a recommended place. They were very good, and Frites Alors offered a variety of sauces for us to sample. Our server was also very friendly and, recognizing we were from out of town, spent time explaining the menu and our meal to us.",2
"I am delighted that two years later I love this place. Great atmosphere and yummy food. We went on a Tuesday night and the 1.50 tacos were surprisingly yummy. Not to mention the mac n cheese is pretty incredible. Everyone including the kids were thrilled with their dinners. Definitely a great place for after work drinks, dinner with friends or the whole family. A Madison must!",2
Love this place. So many options of food to choose from. Everything kept pretty clean and staff restock food when it gets low. Different seasonings to add flavor to your food. Cayenne pepper is my favorite. 3 different size bowls to choose from so if u aren't too hungry you can get the right amount and not pay too much. One of those places you have to try out.,2
Took my niece to see an afternoon movie and was pleasantly happy to see the matinee pricing and the super clean theatre. The chairs are super comfortable almost TOO comfortable.lol and the staff from the ticket counter to the snack counter were all friendly and helpful. Great location and exceptional experience! Will definitely return!,2
I want to thank Doug in the hardware department for finding me a pair of diagonal cutting pliers to cut my piece of crap bike lock cable when the key wouldn't go into the stupid lock. It did the trick and for only seven dollars which is sad given it was securing a 300 bike don't ever buy a masterlock. I also have never had an issue with annoying loss prevention here.,2
"Here in Vegas for team meeting and we wanted to eat something off the strip and this definitely did it for us! Love the variation of soup selection, try hangover soup and be surprised! I had the stir fried rib eye tasted like yummy bulgogi.by the way, if you're not too hungry, it's enough to share! but the best was their ""barbecue ribs "" so tasty and well marinated! A must go!",2
As I write this I am STILL waiting for our food. This place is absolutely horrible. I will never come here again. Been waiting over an hour for our meal. Come on the service should be way better. Don't come here. The one good thing about this place is the food was good when it actually did get to the table.,1
"The Hummus wrap at Sub Station II is by far, hands down, the best hummus wrap in the area. The bread is also fresh. For the life of me, I have no idea why people go to the Subway that is near it. It is a hangover cure. It is cheap. They have Dr Brown's root beer. AND my dogs are happily posted on the wall the Christmas chihuahuas one is the devil and one is the angel .",2
"Early Sunday morning no one there, but that means fewer check outs open. Now that they have re configured the store, no longer able to go in through garden center and pick up pet supplies or health, beauty supplies quickly. It's also a darn shame they decreaseed the craft suppies like fabrics. Still cheapest prices overall.",2
"Blah, that's my impression. Been here a few times when family comes in from Hawaii, they get coupons to eat here, so we will come along. Today, it was very bland, nothing stood out as exceptional and everything seemed to taste the same. I don't know if it was me, but I didn't want to go back for more. The quality has certain gone down hill.",1
We stayed at the Venetian and there's an awesome deal where you get to cut the line and get in for free! Major hookup highly recommend staying at Venetian to get those perks. We went on a Thursday night and the music was AWESOME. It was a mix of electronic plus a good amount of hip hop music. The place was packed and a lot of great people there. Definitely recommend it I will be back there!,2
"Great food. However I am severely lactose intolerant, so every time I come here I ask for the falafel plate with no dressing. Over half the time they put the dressing on the food.The first time I decided to just go with it, and I learned that if I eat the dressing I will be completely empty within an hour. I wish I could trust eating here.",1
Service is absolutely HORRIBLE! Waited 15 minutes before was told the bar are was open seating. Then waited another 15 minutes just to place our food order and then the waitress didn't even listen to what was ordered and had to repeat. Waitress was rude and didn't seem to care. Don't think I'll return regardless of how good the food is.,1
"I went here with a group of friends before celebrating my birthday and came back a couple times later! I've had the Pho Ga and the Pho Bo. Both are delicious but I like the Pho Bo beef better. From what I've seen they keep the place pretty clean and are good on service, and friendly. I would recommend going here. Delicious!",2
The bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it. When returned to the kitchen the 3 Mexican guys in the kitchen were totally talking BS about the customers. In Spanish. Unprofessional and bad. This place is seriously lacking management and the staff all seemed miserable.,1
It is similar to most locations. I have purchased a lot of specific items. Some are lower in price than other locations. Price often depends on the pricer. You can see identical items with different prices in one visit. nAll locations have pleasant personnel and some retailers could learn from Goodwill.,2
"My family ordered a lot of chinese food for christmas day, and we were extremely underwhelmed. For starters, the crispy duck was 25.00 for almost all bones, and lacked any flavor. we also had to pay for the fortune cookies and at least half of the fortune cookies had no fortunes. we tried to branch out from our usual place, super dragon, and were extremely disappointed.",1
"I have lived here for four weeks and have been here 3 times already. Have not gotten a dish I haven't liked yet! My only complaint would be the service, which is slow and a little sloppy, yet redeemed by the servers having great attitudes and being very sweet. Nice decor, clean. Very reasonable price. I was a little concerned about a bottled beer being out dated. check those bottles, guys!",2
"Really bad service, they just did the bed, and didn't change the blankets, didn't sweep, didn't give us Anymore glasses or soap or shampoo or anything, for ALL three nights we were here Thursday friday and Saturday of last week. we always come every 6 months to this hotel, but we really are planning to stay at a different hotel next time since this time the service was just horrible.",1
Complete snobby attitude. Got our puppy from the pound and decided since we live right across the street to give them a shot. The girl was rude and discourteous. Blonde girl. Said they were overbooked when there was no sign of life anywhere in the clinic or out in the parking lot. I'll keep my business elsewhere.,1
"Not only is Studio 212 a convenient and affordable place to get your hair cut and styled, but Yvonne Curtis, the owner of Studio 212, is also a very talented stylist whose attention to detail, friendly personality, and care for her clients keep you coming back. As someone who is extremely particular about my haircuts, I would highly recommend Yvonne and Studio 212!",2
"I went to try the place on a recommendation from a friend who stayed there and a promo from the hotel for a 40 mid week rate. Great place for double the price! The room was well appointed, clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly, casino is large with a good layout, cool sports book, nice pool area, movie theater ROCKS!",2
"Pretty good pizza, and I really like that it arrives piping hot! nI had it with anchovies not every one favorite topping and mushrooms or just with sausage. I have only tried the thin original crust, which is crispy and just a little chewy. Sauce is flavorful and the sausage was great quality. Is not cheap though, but worth it.Check your mail as they send out coupons from time to time.",2
This place is not good at all. The only thing that is good is the chips and salsa which they charge for . Ordered a Michelada and anyone who knows what a Michelada is knows that it doesn't consist of Lime juice and salt with a beer. The food was bland as well. Definitely not coming back here and I'm not recommending this place at all.,1
"Went here for Valentine's Day. The owner was very accommodating, and the food was presented well albeit a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for . The French onion soup and oysters were good. The cocktails were nice. The wine suggestions with the rack of lamb and the remainder of the meal was excellent! Very quaint, and chic!",2
"We had a great time at this place. The wait was only about 10min for Saturday night dinner. Outdoor seating is wonderful due in part to the location in relation to the Civic Center. Our server was great and quick to answer or find the answer to all questions we had regarding the menu. Our food was tasty and arrived at our table quickly. The decor is hip and fun. Overall, a great experience.",2
I ordered Huevos rancheros. It's pretty good. Very good service. Good food. The sandwhich looks good. Good pork chop. Weird restroom place. There were lots of people lining up to just get into the restaurant. It's easier to get into the restaurant in singles than as in a group. FYI. Great hidden place to dine in.,2
"This review is for a lunch seating. We sat down, ordered, ate and nothing came back up. That's about the only nice thing I can say about the food. Service was very friendly and it's got decent ambience, especially on the patio. If you must eat here, unless you enjoy government cheese melted onto soggy cardboard, I suggest you avoid the pizzas.",1
"Rude, rude, rude. Over priced. The bartender could barely communicate and didn't give us 5 minutes to look at the menu before he was telling us we had to order or leave. Not one customer in the place and he wants to rush us out. Glad there are many other choices in the airport with trained staff who welcome customers",1
"Oh Barrio. How I wanted to love your food. 1 app, 1 entree, 1 margarita 55.00. The guac was good niice addition of the Pom. The halibut veracruz was not seasoned well and the side of seasonal veggies was just half cook thick planks of zucchini. I like to try places Guy Fieri visits this was miss for me.",1
"Take it from a fat guy, this place is awesome! Shrimp, Crab legs, sushi, asian dishes, pastas, salads, all were great. The Dessert bar had literally everything. My partners and I took a picture of the what we had gotten and put it on FB. Had comments about wow, that dessert cart looks awesome and had to explaio, thats what we had.",2
"I have been going here for a few years now, and I have always been treated politely and kindly. The service has always been performed in a timely manner. They have always have been fair about discussing additional services I could benefit from. The waiting area is clean and comfortable. I will continue to use Jiffy Lube for my maintenance needs.",2
"What a great store with such amazing help .these folks know thier biz and are very helpfully and not pushy . I have bought both glasses for myself and little girl here and have had a really hard time fitting yet they fixed her up and she is so happy with her new little cat eye glasses . In a nut shell , fashion forward frames ,great price ,and the best staff in he biz .",2
"Awesome park with something for everyone. It's large and the center lake pond makes for great scenery with the wooded surrounding. Whether you want to run, walk, play tennis or softball, enjoy the playground equipment or have a picnic, you be won't be disappointed. Very dog friendly, which out little guy likes even though he hates dogs ha .",2
"Why would a large franchise store I like this be understaffed during the holidays? There are six parties in line ahead of me there are two cashiers for over 30 customers. This is crazy! I had to circle the entire store to find one customer service representative. This franchise needs to get it together. If my math is correct, I will be in line over 20 minutes before I get to the cashier, wow!",1
"Not as great and tasty as I expected , the very first time I had their sandwich there was barely any meat , second experience surprisingly there was more meat and the bread didn't hurt my gums afterwards . But still they are not the best Vietnamese sandwich I've ever had . Their Thai tea is really amazingly good , I've never had any of their pastries but it does look good and fresh .",1
"The burgers here are good but huge! I tried the button buster which had just the right combination of sweet and tangy. The burger has braised beef short rib an onion ring and bearnaise aioli. The Flavor combinations just awesome. My friend got the salmon burger which was equally delicious. If you like burgers and a fun, kind of trendy atmosphere, you should definitely check this place out.",2
"We came all the way from Richmond VA to find excellent ""Southern Cuisine "". This place has it all. Ambiance and great food. We both were surprised that this restaurant was packed on a Tuesday. A true testament that this restaurant has great food. If you live in or our visiting Phoenix, this is a don't miss.",2
"It's a timeshare. It's not a hotel. Holiday Inn only rents the rooms. The moment you check in you are lied to and pressed into a time share sales pitch. When I tried to share these sentiments with the Holiday Inn online review website, I was censored on 3 separate occassions. Fuck this place. Worst hotel experience I've ever had.",1
"Milunka is great! I never really write yelp reviews but I decided to write one for her because she really takes her time to make sure your face is clean and thoroughly taken care of. Her facials are great because she does extractions, which is probably the most important thing about getting a facial done! I've gone to her twice and will definitely be going back again!",2
"EW. I had their tacos and it was by far the nastiest tacos I've ever had to this date. The chicken was so dry and bland. The steak had a bit more flavor but she took spoonfuls of guacamole and sour cream and everything else just made this taco more like a throw up inside a tortilla. Im just glad I got the drink, I really did like my raspberry tea.",1
"Ok, this was my first time there. A little pricey, but it is all served family style. It is not the best Italian food I have ever had, but it was pretty good and definitely filled me up, with some leftovers for sure. The service was great and will definitely be going back. Go with an appetite and if you are not on a budget.",2
"I landed at the Phoenix airport and wanted a quick sandwich before my next flight. This isn't the place. The service is slow and the staff is inattentive. Had the waitstaff been working and not not talking or standing around, the service could be better. Hopefully their chicken sandwich will be worth the wait.",1
Avoid this place like the plague. The food has gone way down hill and the atmosphere is thug like. Music sucks! On thursday nights they have private security working the door. I was physically assaulted and battered to the ground by one them. Tall guy with dark hair and a mustache. My offence having a cigarette at the door. Would never go there again.,1
"I hate to give such a low rating because I am a loyal fan and have been since they opened. However, for the past year, every time I order delivery my order has been cancelled or postponed by an extra hour due to having a late or no delivery driver, I love your food, but if you don't have a dependable delivery service I'm going to have to order elsewhere.",1

"The Biltmore Macy's is a great location for anyone who needs to get something quick and get out. No worries of parking lots 2 miles away or busy hallways to fight thru. It's selection is not as great as the Scottsdale Macy's and it is a little more cluttered and outdated. Overall, still the first place I would run to for housewares, furniture or clothes.",2
I have a voucher for 2 which I tried to use but can't because I need to give my voucher number while reserving by phone. There is a problem with their phone reservations because there is no one there to man the phones. I tried several times calling with no success. I've also emailed them with no response. nThis is not a knock on their food but on their customer service which sucks.,1
Not impresswd with this shit hospital and i thought Spring Valley was bad. They see you pretty quickly and then youre stuck waiting hours. when you ask if youre going to be seen the nurse has to be a sarcastic bitch. One ounce of advice you guys dont ever go to ERS because theyre all the same. they just give you pain medicone and send you on your way. If icoikd this hospital would be a negative 5!,1
Went there with my friend for lunch. Taken to be seated then completely be forgotten. People after us were served already but we weren't even given the menu. Left the restaurant with huge disappointment. Another nice server came after and apologized for that and offered free meals but I refused that. Thought I would give only 1 star but two for that nice server! Thumb up!,1
"The place looks nice and the waitresses chef are very nice. However, the salmon was not good. It fell apart and had bones in it. I first ordered salmon sashimi and then got salmoigiri instead. I also got the Crunchy roll and it was soft.not crunchy. Overall, I was not impressed with the food but liked the people.",1
"Had a business dinner here last night. Granted there were 20 of us, however dinner took in excess of 3.5 hours. For the group that large we weren't allowed the full menu and the courses still took and extremely long time to get to us. nTwo of the lobster spaghettis got sent back for being way overcooked, and one fish was exchanged entirely for being bad. nMy filet was not bad.",1
"Gourmet sushi that can get the reluctant sushi diners to try raw fish. You can get the traditional sushi if your hardcore, but if you want to try something different, they put a spin on the sushi with different sauces and garnishes. I can't recall all the variations I sampled, but I do know it was good. They have a black cod appetizer on the menu that is a must try.",2
Just attempted to dine here as I had heard good things. We walked into the restaurant and we not greeted. We stood there awkwardly and then decided to seat ourselves. We were there for about 5 minutes when we were never given a menu or even had our presence acknowledged. We left without a trace! We headed to Kaizen where the service is impeccable!,1
"I visited Pita Jungle with a large group on December 23rd. Our whole family got the Gyros and they were great. The only complaint I have is that they do not offer Greek fries like so many other Greek restaurants offer. Perhaps it is because this place is for health freaks. Oh well, I will visit again but I really wish they had Greek Fries. That would take it to 5 stars for sure.",2
"I use to frequent Sage often but it is now under new ownership, whom has totally changed the place and does not honer any of the things that made me love sage in the first place. Its almost like the Grinch has taken over the restaurant, and now you can tell its about the profit line not customer service!. they have lost a ""loyal "" customer.",1
"I was recently in Montreal and wanted to take a break from sightseeing to check out one of the recent blockbusters. I walked about two miles to find out that everything was dubbed in FRENCH. Now I like to think I'm not an obnoxious American who wants everything to fit my needs, but COME ON! It's a brand new movie and last time I checked, Canada has two official languages. double sad face ",1
Nothing better than cruising the strip in a monster sized pink limo! We hired Elite for our friends B day party and it couldn't have been more perfect! Our driver Nico was spot on perfect and really took care of us. I can't wait to use them again. If you want the absolute best in Limo transportation and fun hire Elite. If you want the best driver in Las Vegas ask for Nico!,2
"I have been with Physiques personal training for 2 1 2 years and cannot say enough about how great they are. Craig Tinnelle is the best personal trainer as far as achieving real results, and motivating you to keep going. I have learned a tremendous amount about training, muscle building, and nutrition. At 44 I feel and look 24! Thanks to Craig.",2
"In my opinion, every Ross store is an average store. The clothing selection is usually pretty good they have a lot of nice tops at decent prices. This store in particular is very dirty and unkempt. Clothes all over the floor. Dirt, and something that resembled feces was on the ground next to the women's tops. To me, that kind of filth isn't worth getting a good deal on a top.",1
"I have been going to Niro's for several years. You can always count on them fulfilling your your order very quickly and with consistently good quality. When I am in a hurry between meetings I can count on Niro's to deliver a better experience than I could get at a random fast food joint. The gyros are good, the french fries are hot and crisp and the service is always friendly.",2
"They have a shuttle from the amtrak station. It's modern and nicely laid out the staff is terrific, the rooms are clean and nicely decorated. I was here for a conference and things ran very smoothly. I'm a runner and they had a map of routes and cold water when I returned. There is a nice breakfast bar. Starbucks coffee in the room. It's a block from the UI football field.",2
"Very good theater with friendly staff. The theaters have good screens and chairs. Now they have their deal on Tuesday where you get 2 tix, 2 drinks and 1 popcorn for 22. You can't beat that price. I don't know how long that deal will go on but I hope it goes on for years. I love the stars in the ceiling at the box office.",2
"Overall Fuel Pizza is a good franchise, but this location is terrible. I will never go back. I have had too many terrible experiences. The employees are outright rude. I cant believe this place stays in business. The pizza is subpar as well. If you want fuel pizza go to one of their other locations. Plaza Midwood is solid.",1
Third trip to this place all three time service was horrible even wheot busy. Hostess sits you and nobody comes over walked out today after 15 mins with nobody even acknowledging we were there. I get the feeling they don't really care if they get repeat customers because so many new suckers visit Vegas daily. I'm done no more.,1
"Time to update this review. I remember when this mall was the place to come and shop.now, it's one of the worst places to come and shop. It's been going downhill for years. During a recent trip, I stopped by to see if it has gotten better.the mall is Ghetto and isn't worth the effort. I think it's time to close it. Return Factor 0 ",1
"The desserts are pretty good but have an inaccurate calorie count. As far as the other food they offer, it is far from fresh. They have people bring in food that's been pre made. no different than what you can get at the ABC store next door which actually tastes better . Last time I'll ever eat at Red Velvet.",1
"Why did I rate this place 2 stars? 1 for host, hostess and store cashier with attitude. n 1 for closing down the ""chocolate factory "" because of a celebrity. Defeats the purpose of why I came here. n 1 frozen hot chocolate. Hmmm . Where have I seen that from? n 1 our nice accommodating server n I'd you get the chance to sit outside, go for it. You'll enjoy watching people and making fun of them.",1
"Someone below mentioned Hondaya in LA, it DOES remind me of this place. We ordered half size ramen dx, regular shoyu ramen, kushi katsu tonkatsu on a stick with onions inside , fried quail eggs, beef tongue yakitori, agedashi tofu, honey toast and a pitcher of kirin. FYI, 30 mins after the place opened, it was completely packed.",2
A Nightmare on Thanksgiving! Posted rate of 39.95 for Buffett. The when you get there were charged 21 for glasses of water that we had to flag someone down to get! No one ever waited on us and our table of four was charged an 18 gratuity! We could not have been more disappointed and felt very taken advantage of.,1
"Dinner was terrific. We started with the diver scallops, which were perfectly cooked. For dinner I had the bone in rib eye with foie gras on the side. The truffle mac cheese and creamed spinach were extremely flavorful. I really don't see how this is a 3 star restaurant. It may not be a 5, but certainly earns a 4!",2
Food AMAZING. One of the best breakfast places I ate ever. I ordered the Denver omelet which included hash browns and upgraded my toast to french toast for a 1. Everything hit the spot! Ambience cute. It was very blue. Wait Nope. Service They paid a lot of attention! All the customers were locals except for us! LOL Will I come back Hell yeah! Every time I go back to vegas!,2
"The worst customer service from the manager in charge,Rude and did not care about a simple trailer wash out that when bought back to the food shipper that rejected the trailer to begin with look at it and said "" did u get it washout,? Looks the same "" well I should have inspected before leaving and I will with these guys from now on. The worst in my over 12 years over the road.",1
These are the best pretzels in Pittsburgh. Period. It's tough to walk by and not pick up some pretzels to take home. I recently used them to help cater a holiday party. a. It was only 20 for 50 freakin' pretzels. b. They had the order ready on time. c. The pretzels were great as left overs days later. Win all around.,2
"Haze is one of my favorite clubs to go to in the City Center. The music is always on point and the drinks are always strong. I would highly recommend you coming to Haze Nightclub at the Aria if you're visiting Las Vegas! Get a VIP Host to make you a bottle service reservation. Trust me, it's honestly the best way to go for a guaranteed good time!",2
"Value is the key word in this equation. If I spend 15 on a pizza, I want a decent pizza. This left the lady and I looking at each other wondering where the rest of it was. We ended up scavenging for salad stuff at home to ensure we were filled up. The pizza was good, but not what I really was hoping to get. Sorry guys, but I'll be going back to Barro's for my pie.",1
"best luck to wait in line for a guy behind the desk. The other two sales associates were too busy posing as customers in an empty store to acknowledge the one customer, me, that was there. This is a real change from some other verizon stores where somebody greets you, gives you a number, and the associates talk to customers and want you to buy their products. Weird vibe in this store.",1
Always impeccable service. This time courtesy of Alan our server and his crew. Went with the grilled octopus to start and was so flavorful and would get as an entry if available. Adult beverages were Margarita and leeches martini. Both were excellent. We will always come here for the service and exemplary cuisine.,2
"Disgusting, tried multiple items and the only fresh product they serve is the ""Pete's Sauce "". You're better off buying a fry daddy and some frozen fish to make at home. Also, don't even think of using your debit or credit card to purchase anything cash only. If you forget to bring cash they'll let you use their ATM, if you don't mind the convenience fee. Don't waste your time with this place.",1
"I went to this store on my way in for my Vegas weekend. I had realized I was almost out of Verviene perfume the night before, when I was packing. I was excited to find a store right there. I saw great reviews on Yelp and it definitely lived up to the expectation. I was helped by Amber, who was very helpful and super friendly. It was a great experience and I recommend the store highly.",2
"2 stars. but it's really not all that bad. I mean it is decent asian food for being in Vegas. but it's pricey for cheapy noodle house style food and with all the other stuff to eat in Vegas. I'm not sure why you would eat here, but say you're in Vegas for like a really long time and you're craving that cheapy asiaoodle house style food, then you'd find your fix here.",1
"Is there an option for 0 stars? If so go ahead and count me. My mom recently got a haircut, nail, facial. And I looked at my credit statement and its charging me close to 350. Not sure if there is some initial charge and later they decrease the amount they are actually charging. But it left me with a smelly after taste. I am going to follow up with them and find out the exact details.",1
"Worst customer service. Waiting over an hour for my ""freaky fast "" food to be delivered. Days later, I realized my credit card was charged incorrectly. Instead of the management being customer service orientated and making it an easy situation to fix they were the exact opposite. I will never be returning, nor would I recommend it to any friends or families in the neighborhood.",1
working on the strip for 5 years I expect good service bc I know the service I give to customers. buut when I walked in I passed 5 diff workers one was the mgr not one person greeted me. Then when I asked to speak to a mgr I was questioned why I was asking. everyone seemed to have an attitude when we asked for a sample. very displeased w everything about the store.,1
One of the best topless shows I've seen in Vegas. We sat at one of the tables right in front with the requisite drunk guy a table or 2 over and had a really good time. The dancing was amazing and all the girls were beautiful. The question came to mind How do they find so many different girls with the same body type? No silicone in sight and my wife and I both loved the show!,2
"Worst service I've ever had. I'm literally sitting in here as I post this. The sign says ""please seat yourself "" and I've sat at the same table for twenty minutes now and not a SINGLE server has even greeted me ! Let alone ask me if I want a drink. Nice atmosphere but I value service, and I see ZERO here. Lets see how long it takes before I can get an ice tea.",1
Worst service I've ever had in any restaurant. Absolutely no attention to the customers and the food it's self wasn't anything anything to rave about. The Environment was just gross and it wreaked of smoke. And yes vegas it's typical for places to smell of smoke but the place you go to dinner should not.,1
"Color printer was down for maintenance could not provide me with a concrete turnaround time. No problem, I understand that this happens. What irked me was that they refused to recommend any other printing service in the Pittsburgh area, citing ""conflict of interest. "" Be professional! If you can't do the job for me, help me find someone that can. Will never use.",1
"This place is great. The Bao are delicious, the shortrib grilled cheese with extra tomato compote is rich, delicious and filling, and the lunchtime service is kind, prompt, and helpful. It might not be in the nicest area, but there is security and the casino staff is nice as well. Beware the working ""girls "" in the casino lol.",2
"This is one of those hidden gems that you'll want to take out of town guests to. It's located just off of the I 10, next to a tire shop, but when you step inside, you're transported to your favorite restaurant in Rocky Point. They have an extensive menu of REALLY good food and they'll let you order off the breakfast menu all day. This is my new favorite Mexican food restaurant!",2
"Great food, friendly service. I've tried several of their dishes, but prefer the lo mein category the children's lo mein is actually quite good. Not sure why pei wei gets negative ratings, but I enjoy this place as much as I do Tott's Asian Diner. Both are great places to eat at. It'd be nice if pei wei had listed open closed hours though.",2
"Was hoping this place would be on the cheaper side. Wrong. A burger made with cheap meat pretty sure it was pre cooked and re heated and gross cheese with a coke shouldn't cost 17.50. The fries were good but not that good. The seats are ripped, the waiters so so, and the general vibe equals meh. Will avoid this placee the rest of my trip.",1
"This place is great. Just got back from a long trip and the car definitely needed a wash. After going through, the manager came up to me and asked if I wouldn't mind going through again because he noticed the bumper still had a lot of bugs on it. Then he worked on it with a brush before the second time through. I am on their unlimited monthly plan. A real deal as far as I'm concerned.",2
"I love McAlister's Deli and it's great to have one nearby. The kids meals are only 99 cents every day, which means my family, which includes four kids, can eat here for under 20! The food is delicious, the sweet tea is the best in town, and it has a great lunch atmosphere for casual or business lunches. Highly recommended.",2
"I've been a member for about 3 months and so far so good.The massages are nice, they have aromatherapy available which is awesome, but you do have to remind them you want it. They place hot towels on you after your massage which is nice as well. If you are like me with horrible neck and shoulders I would definitely recommend Tara.",2
"I was shopping for a company to do monthly service. nWhen I called Azteca I spoke directly with the owner, nHe was able to answer all my questions, and provide peace nOf mind that all new customers want! The techs have beeVery nice and informative. Will definitely recommend to family nAnd friends! nThanks for great service Azecta, nTara R.",2
"Outstanding food and sublime service! This is a hidden gem in Phoenix and Aaron the manager personally engages each patron to ensure a beyond the wow customer experience. Don't let locale fool you, it is definitely a must for food lovers. We now have a new favorite which we will enjoy for years to come!m",2
"Use caution when ordering the chips as an appetizer. The seasoning they use has a horrendous amount of salt, so much it was burning my lips.The homemade salsa had a lovely flavor, just left unable to eat d t the awful chips. The black bean soup was had great flavor and texture but again was so salty I couldn't eat but a few bites. The blue corn bread was a delight!",1
"Very good food for what the price is. Nice service, very attentive. Elaine was very nice. First time I had fried pollock. The clam chowder was good but could have been hotter. The fries were good but the seasoning I could do without. But overall I was happy with the food. I would come back to try something different.",2
I've been a huge fan of Sushi 101 for years. I seldom get around to the University location but that one is my favorite. At both locations they consistently serve up great sushi the noodle bowls are delicious too! And the service is so quick. I'm talking in and out in under 20 minutes. Which can be a major bonus at times.,2
"We found this place in the Phoenix magazine. It didn't live up the write up. Our experience was bad service, long wait times and unfriendly staff. The food wait time was excessive. The food qaulity was average. We were charges 4 for a soda! Save your next food experience and money on some place else.",1
Im telling the truth im 50 years old. saw show last September 2011 It was the worst .They were acting like they were taping show asking people to be load and laugh .Sound system was Bad. Ive been to a lot of shows in Vegas and this and the Caveman show are 2 of the worst .Had to walk out on Gordie 45 min into hes show after he made a tasteless 911 joke.dont waste time even if your comp tickets,1
Oh No! nTo begin with twist cap wine really? nThere's more produce in the outside window than in the iceberg salad and for my heart attack stuffed potato if it were stuffed it wouldn't have killed a guppy. If you like good beef salud the beef is good the lobster not so much. nWould not go here again.bye bye bob nFor that price go to charcoal room,1
"I have seen many chiropractors over the years, but this time I found one that not only treated the ailment but took the time to discuss how the mind and body connect and what was causing my discomfort. Dr. Nemanic is a caring professional who goes beyond giving just an adjustment and treats the entire body as a whole.",2
"Melissa, from Mosaic, cut, colored and styled my hair a couple weeks ago and it was one of the best experiences. She was super professional, had great ideas and was reasonably priced. I usually get my hair done in CA and it costs . Melissa G was great! I highly recommend her! I will definitely be back.",2
"Wow, wow, wow. This restaurant made me fall in love with Montreal as being one of top cities for good food. To be honest, dinner was great, but I can't really recall what I had. What I do remember is the French Toast Dessert afterward! I polished off every bite and fought my colleague off from stealing from my plate. I don't care if I gained 10 pounds that evening, every bite was worth it.",2
"Fiori's is always great pizza especially when you're on the way home from town and hungry. It's open late, and usually packed on the weekends. My recommendation, however, is to go to Campitis a few blocks away, on Potomac Ave in Dormont if it's not too late, as they have the best pizza in Dormont. But you'll never go wrong here, either. Quick, good pizza, and always a pleaser.",2
"The servers are nice and the presentation of the food was fairly sophisticated, but the actual taste of the food was disappointing. We ordered a large veriety of things and to be honest none of it was good at all. I suggest going to dinner elsewhere and just ordering drinks desert at Tanzy aka iPics.",1
This is a lovely store with lovely things and lovely folks. I was purchasing something there and I had hours to kill before I had to pick someone up at the airport. I asked about local antique malls and the owner kindly drew me out excellent maps of nearby places and I spent the rest of the day quite happy. I just love what I bought there too!,2
"Got bagels here to take to the team at work. The staff was patient with me as I picked out the exact mix I wanted to take in, and they had a few recommendations. The bagels were your basic bagels that I've come to expect from Einstein or Panera type places. Good but nothing to write home or give a great Yelp review! about.",2
"as Maria T. puts it ""closed thank god "" hahahah i went here with some of my girls back in march. i was excited that there was a pre fix menu and it was pretty cheap only like 30 . service was great. nice people. food MEH! wolfgang, im disappointed in you! a few weeks ago a friend texted me from vegas ""omg chinois is closed! "" my response GOOD, THAT PLACE SUCKED ANYWAY!",1
"We have tried this place three different times, and have ordered different items each time, only to be completely disappointed. I love Dr. Weil, and WISH I could give this place a good review, but the food is flavorless, boring, unseasoned, and DULL. I am about worthless in the kitchen myself, and the dishes are about as imaginative as my own awful cooking, but with less flavor. We give up.",1
"Staff is very friendly and service is great. Would suggest avoid making reservation for the weekend or peak dinner hours, most likely wait a while for food and drinks. It is a bit pricey but food is amazing! Would suggest anything off the sushi menu never had any roll here tho , kurobuta pork robotayaki, miso cod and the teppanyaki of sea bass and Waygu is heaven!",2
Came here for breakfast and had one of the best omelette's I've ever had. The eggs were fluffy and cooked perfectly. My gf had the Benedict with chive hollandaise. We added a croissant that was crispy and buttery. It's a little pricey but it's Vegas so what do you expect. Can't wait to back for dinner! Oh the hash browns were some of the best I ever had.,2
On our way out of Vegas I decided to try this place. I love eggs for breakfast and found this place on yelp. Thx fellow yelpers. You didn't disappoint. It's not too fat from the freeway and easy to find The banana muffin was awesome. I inhaled mine so fast. I had the Brad's special with the yummy ranch potatoes. The price was great too. I'm definitely coming back here when I'm in Vegas.,2
Don't do it PLEASE! My Mom and Me ate here and I'm only giving it one star because my mom said her meatloaf was good. I had the fried Bologna sandwich can't mess that up WRONG. The guy taking our order has customer service issues. Please tell me why folk who have working with the public jobs have the worst attitudes,1
"Ate here about a month ago, actually ordered and took home. Had the chilidog, husband had fish and chips. Everything was really good. Chili and Fries were delicious. Will definitely eat here again. They were a little on the slow side to get it all together, but that was fine. They were extra attentive though, you can tell they care about their service.The coleslaw was bland in my opinion.",2
"Any bar that can spin Neil Young with electronica has my vote. The gin cocktails are fantastic, the place is always packed at night and the service is top notch even though the place was bursting at the seams. This is definitely the place to be when it's cold out and it's not too full of hipsters, thank god.",2
"A Pittsburgh institution. I recently went on Steeler Sunday around 10am the wait was less than 5 minutes and the service still adequate constant coffee refills . The sausage is delicious. Try it on a fried egg sandwich but be prepared to take some to go. It's dirty, greasy, and packed full of Pittsburgh nostalgia just like a greasy spoon should be! FYI cash only ",2
"I just walked out of this store. Three people all behind the and not one acknowledgement, even though one person looked me directly in the eyes. I'm sorry but I'll gladly pay a little extra for some help. This store needs some serious secret shopper action I can't believe that behavior is acceptable.",1
"I love the food and enjoy dining here. The staff is always friendly and professional. I always tip greater than 20 because the food is always well prepared, the staff is professional and attentive, and I support local business. The only negative is that they do not provide a ""salad plate "" to diners to eat their chips and salsa off of.",2
"There are much better sushi choices available. This place is just okay, but I like sushi to be spectacular. The employees were lots of fun, they had the best sense of humor, and the service was excellent. The prices were very good. I was there on a Monday, so I just tried the sushi. I might go back for the Korean BBQ.",1
"I got spam and eggs and rice. I know its nothing big, but I have it at a lot of other places and this was just blah. I could have totally made it better at home. My friends said the bowls they got were pretty good, but I just wasn't impressed. I would rather go to the Cal hotel and get oxtail there or topselog filipino breakfast. Now that is what I call Yumm.",1
"My friend took me here for my birthday. I thought the food was excellent and the signature, pineapple drink was to die for! We shared a shrimp cocktail and they were seriously the best shrimp I've had in my life. The filet was excellent and the sides were awesome. It's a little out of the way, and you probably need to take a cab, but definitely a great steakhouse.",2
"War hier f u00fcr eine Nacht und bin sehr zufrieden. Das Einzelzimmer war ein einzeln belegtes Doppelzimmer, mit viel Platz, Schreibtisch und Sessel. Das Fr u00fchst u00fccksb u00fcffet ist gro u00df und man findet alles was man sich w u00fcnschen w u00fcrde. Nettes Personal und faire Preise. Die Lage direkt neben dem Stadtpark und 10 Minuten zu Fuss vom Hauptbahnhof ist auch klasse.",2
"Very small men's section with very few fashionable items. Coming from Chicago this is really sort of dingy and small overall. Understaffed, there was nobody to help out or do dressing room assistance even on a not so busy day. Old feeling store with poor lighting. Surely there're better stores in the city.",1
"This is still the best breakfast bet at the Wynn. We got a smoothie, a green juice and steel cut oats to go for our car ride home and everything was fresh and healthy. Just what I needed! There aren't very many healthy options while you are in Vegas so this is a gem when you are ieed of something healthy in the morning!",2
"I love food trucks. In Los Angeles, there has been a food truck explosion. The Slider Truck is as good if not better then some of the LA trucks. The sliders are fantastic. The sauce, the bread and the meat all work together to have a party in your mouth. Yummmm mouth party! Only reason I can't give it five stars.the lines are long. I suggest you plan ahead and get there early.",2
"Tried it for the first time with my wife. The chili chicken was spicy delicious. nThe lamb shwarma was tender very tasty. All entrees come with salad, basmati rice and flat bread. The d u00e9cor was very nice as well. I also liked the fact that you norder at the counter and the food is brought out to you. nLooking forward to going back and trying some of the nother dishes.",2
"I did not come to this location for over a year because of bad service. Decided to give another chance , so I am back . Service is definitely improved except cooking abilities. Ordered Philly skillet with Swiss cheese. I guess cook has no difference between cheeses . They brought Philly skillet with squeezed cheep cheese. Really? They think people dumb ! No more to this location !",1
"Hooked! This hot new spot is not only super chic, sophisticated, and romantic.the food is phenomenal! I can't get enough! When it first opened. I was there at least once a week. It's that good! Staff is superbly friendly! Gorgeous atmosphere! Best date spot or girls night out! This is my new go to! I'm in love!",2
"They damaged my car and lost my cup holder. The manager Mike blamed both on me and said he could not help. Very disappointed. Also, I noticed several missed spots. Forgot to wipe rear view mirror, over shampooed the carpet disgusting smell , and the list goes on. Horrible service and don't care for customers at all in my opinion.",1
I was looking for a new PCP since I'm new to the area and I saw Dr. Turner today. She was great! I might be biased be she was as much of a wildcat fan as me but she also answered my questions well. The checking in process was a bit annoying but when isn't it. Over all I am very happy with my experience and am excited to have Dr. Turner take care of me!,2
"This place gets two stars because the food is pretty good but the service really deters me. I called to place an order for pick up. They were in the middle of taking it and said, ""We are really busy can I call you back? "" They informed they had caller I.D. and repeated my number back to me. After waiting over an hour they never called back. Who does that? I'll never be eating here again.",1
"Need some new kicks? No, not the kind you can find at your local Payless or the Nike Outlet. Something old school, something unique. UNDFTD is the place to be. You go in there and it's so hip you feel like a dance battle could breakout at any moment. Without a doubt this is a fun place so shop and truly a diamond in the ruff.",2
"I don't get it. We had bottle service. The drinks were meh. The music wasn't much better. I couldn't get my dance on. Tao kept launching streamers in the air which of course landed in my champagne each and every time. Strict dress code. Please keep in mind that I am not a clubber, I like to lounge Hollywood style.",1
"I love parking here! They are always so welcoming at the gate and quick and helpful when you return. The customer service is great, clean, and quick. Plus you get a coupon when you park for a voucher for a free cookie at Paradise Bakery. There is nothing better than having no hassle parking and boarding a plane with a warm, fresh chocolate chip cookie. Park here and you will be pleased!",2
"I frankly don't get why people like this place.with exception of desert, fruit, cake, dipped in chocolate ok, I get it.its good and I would go back for that and that alone. But for dinner.way overpriced, way overrated. Not family friendly at all. There are much better options out there in terms of value and quality.",1
"What a nice little place, I really must say I liked it! nVery nice looking place, with great customer service. nI loved the scotch, over one large ice cube. Perfect for me. nHappy Hour was a nice end to a rough day. nA little hard to find parking in the downtown area here. nHowever, it is quite a busy place,so I guess that is why. nI had no idea downtown was jamming like this!",2
"Brought me safely from point A to point B several times. I think people forget that's what the airline is for. It's not about feeding you, stroking your ego or accommodating your afternooap. All airlines overbook flights. All airlines have delays. US Airways does quiet a bit to help the community like sponsoring the Phoenix Zoo, donating to St Mary's food bank, the United Way.",2
"Just had lunch there with the homie. The place was busy and the service was quick. I had the BBQ beef bowl with a side of Mac salad. The veggies were prepared nice and al dente, the meat was tender and flavorful. My buddy had BBQ beef lunch and with two soft drinks it was all less than 18. I will definitely be back.",2
"Favorite place to get a burger, hands down. Since I am GF, it is a great option to have GF buns. I typically get the Turkey burger with avocado, tomato, mushrooms and onions. The only drawback? The place is rather small and can get rather crowded. But, that's a good thing because it shows how popular it is.",2
Fantastic food and very cool atmosphere! Recommend the pretzel fondue.enough to share.very yummy. Wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu and was so right on about all our picks! Had the meatloaf and was floored.just delicious.best I have ever had at a restaurant. Friends had the fried chicken and cleaned their plates.can't wait to come back!,2
"Spinach salad is a must try. Pad thai is good, not as good as Lotus of Siam. Pad see ew tastes similar to Pin Kaow. Really good thai iced tea. Pricier than most thai restaurants. Service is good and fast. Decor is lovely. I will probably go once in a while but since Pin Kaow is nearby, this will not be a regular place for me.",2
"Overrated! Honestly the actual hot dog tasted regular, nothing special.the buns were regular, nothing special.they just threw a bunch of sides on top of a REGULAR hot dog! At 6 7a hot dog, presentation is only a fraction of what i expected. nDon't get me wrong, would i eat here again?.probably.could it be better? YES",1
"Terrible place. Customer service is non existant. They went to the wrong house after I gave them the address. I left them a message to schedule an appointment and it took them a week to get back to me. The only bright side is that the cleaning staff is pretty good but they were a half hour late. However, I would not recommend the company because they are not reliable.",1
"The food is awesome! Particularly, the quesadilla del dia and the chopped salad are great! Even the bread pudding cake left us scooping the plate dry. One fault the margaritas are way to tart and sweet. Don't expect a real margarita it's counterfeit. But don't let that steer you away from this place in terminal four, space D. Everything else is great, especially the Bloody Mary's!",2
"Time for an update.this was not one of my favorite joints. However, over the past year or so, they've improved their product offering and we've found several pieces of jewelry at a great price here. I no longer find golf clubs here, but the improvement in jewelry selection bumps them up 1 Star for me. Service here is so so, seems to change when they turnover employees. Return Factor 85 ",2
"Keeping the girls spoiled all the time I get their food,treats and toys at Petsmart. This is my go to location due to its closeness to my house and I usually go to Sprouts on the same trip, very convenient! Always a friendly staff and there is never that long of a line. They have yet to run out of the products I buy so I will keep coming back",2
"Moved down to phoenix and I didn't have a new waxer yet so I decided to try Roose since I live nearby and I couldn't be happier with my decision, LeAnne was awesome! It can be awkward getting a new bikini waxer, but she was so professional and made the process as comfortable as possible with good convo and telling me about the products and what not. I definitely recommend!",2
"Nice clothes. Organized store. Everyone who works there is friendly. They do need a more official sign. I'm glad it's near UNLV. The area near UNLV is starting to get a bit nicer thanks to Starbucks, a remodeled Vons grocery store and the cool Pho restaurant. The prices are less than Buffalo Exchange.",2
"Come here once a month just for Sushi always delicious, always consistent. Come with a group and we are located in various places around the US so we are comparing it to what we like in our respective cities. All agree that this matches up to our local favorites and is definitely the best place for Sushi in this part of town.",2
"Went to Robuchon for my birthday, had my best French experience ever better than Daniel in NYC ! I had 16 course tasting menu, the food is excellent and the service is spectacular! For 395 per person, it was worth it, such an amazing experience! Also note, their tasting menu is changed on daily basis.",2
"I'm starting, or rather, have been experiencing the ""Subway Effect "" with Glass Nickel, where regardless of what you get, everything just seems to taste the same. The pizza is good, but it doesn't leave me wanting more. In fact, it's been quite the opposite lately, as we only begrudgingly order from their because it's convenient, not necessarily because it's so good.",2
"YUM! We ate here twice during our stay Marriott Renaissance. nWe ordered enjoyed sliders, Trio and ahi salad! All good choices. Friendly, fast service. Love their new decor. Super cool furniture. I also like all of the windows which makes for a nice open feel. Bar is nice with T.V.'s for sports and news seekers. Casual spot. Nice for lunch or before dinner drinks and appetizers.",2
I had a layover in Clt so I decided to get my nails done and I was pleasantly surprised. The technicians were very friendly and did a great job for a decent price. A lot cheaper than most of the places I have been going! I will make a special trip back to Clt just so I can get my nails and eye brows done!,2
"We've been customers at this Rock Bottom for more than 8 years. Tonight we were asked to leave immediately after arriving. Why? Because my boyfriend worked for an affiliated restaurant and it didn't work out so he left. Is that a reason to ask someone to leave? I think not, One star is well deserved for the incredibly poor way they treat their loyal patrons.",1
"Yelp misled us here or we arrived on an off night. The quality of everything we tried was subpar. Mind you, being from San Francisco, we have very high food standards. This place just didn't cut it, especially after waiting in line an hour and a half. We ate at the Wynn buffet before and it was much better. I definitely wouldn't return here or recommend it.",1
"People, It's so plane and simple. If you're an idiot and you don't care about where you waste your money and you want to be treated like trash then by all means go give your money to these losers, like so many dumb people have. But, if you value your family, time, and money, stay away from this disgusting company and their putrid sales staff.",1
This is a bit out of the way but I was pleasantly surprised. They got us in very quick and did a nice job on the pedi. Even the hub was pleased as she brought out the power sander just kidding to our dry dry feet. The prices are competitive and the massage chairs were some of the best around. The creative design on my toes was no challenge and turned out awesome.,2
"5 Guys Burgers and Fries cooks their hamburgers and fries in peanut oil. The company is based in Virginia, and promotes Virginia agriculture. The burgers are big, juicy and very tasty. The fries are OK. The soda machine is very cool they are computer controlled you can mix and match ALOT of different flavors. Come with wipes, because they are messy!",2
"Sage Fried Chicken Dried fried chicken breast. Maybe I ate it without going through a heavy night of drinking first. I couldn't really eat this dry chicken w o some additional maple syrup. However, it vastly improves once moisture is added. The extra sage leaves they give you adds a lot more flavor punch. You can get the Sage Fried Chicken in a pasta, with waffles, on salad, and in a sandwich.",1
"This place is so cool. I was waiting for it to open and now it is. It has potential to be one of my new regular places. I really appreciate the Dungeness Crab, hard to beat. The crawfish is next on my list, other people say to try the shrimp. There is a game playing from every angle. Definitely worth a visit.",2
"The rooms here are cheap and you get what you pay for. The gambling here is the best on Fremont. Low minimum bets make it really fun in my opinion. Definitely try the lobster tank skill crane. It is 2 and you can try to catch a live lobster. Highlight of my trip hands down. If you are coming off of Fremont, walk past the cages and keep going. It's across from Tinoco's Kitchen.",1
"This place is great. EXCEPT. dont expect to get ANY service if you like to play pool, Golden Tee, or Buck Hunter. Unless your dating someone there or are foolish enough to gamble ungodly amounts of money. You could probably pack your own drinks in and nobody would notice. My friends call it the area of invisibilty. We are currently looking fo another place to regular at.",1
"Probably would have never bothered with Rain but we got club hopper passes so figured might as well. Personally, I think its way overhyped. Its just pretty much a big room where you can dance. No special decor.everyone can pretty much get in and the music is kinda lame. Couldn't stand being there for more than an hour. Compared to other Vegas clubs this place is a major downgrade.",1
"I had a new experience today at the market a 30 minute wait to check out! One Windmill Farm had all kinds of produce this week apples, pears, corn, peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, potatoes. . I got to the market around 9.15 two hours earlier than usual, for me and saw it in full swing. If you want to avoid the crowds, go later but there might not be much left.",2
This use to be my regular Indian takeaway. Unfortunately they have either changed their chefs or each time I have been in a different chef has been cooking! Food used to be really tasty now it's bland and not very flavoursome as it once was. I now go to Tikka Masala The Pleasance which is fantastic!,1
"Wonderful experience for 2 or more that enjoy world class protein. This is definitely a spot for carnivores and if that's not your thing, I'd find other options. Great selection of pasta side dishes to be shared amongst the table. But the star of the show is the carne for 2 cut table side. Wonderful dining experience with a ridiculous wine list.",2
I went into Freddies After my workout at LVAC because I saw a sign that said they had new internet prices well I can tell you that their prices are not internet prices they are quite higher their selection is poor compared to the other stores in town and their prices are higher .Overall I was not very impressed at all .I will not be coming Back!,1
"These guys are great! Went to them for several months after a major foot surgery. Dave, Jessica aka Amazing , and Lisa will take care of you. Family friendly an professional, it was strangely sad that my therapy was over. I experienced major improvement and would recommend them to anyone. Thanks guys! Sam",2
"Inside the same hotel as of XS nightclub, just about the same features and decor. Outside club is much better, its not hot and musty all the damn time. Drinks and pricey. Cabanas are available from top to bottom. Most nights are 20 40 cover for guys and gals. More space than XS of course. Stripper pole in the middle of the dance floor for the gals and guys to work it. the end.",2
"Nail tech didn't respond to ouch or pulling my foot away when she stabbed in to my cuticle. She continued the same procedure with every nail. I finally asked her to stop and she gave me a dirty look and started yelling in another language. Whatever, you drew blood. I'm done here. Stay away from the crazy place.",1
"Excellent souvlaki, great service, locally owned. I'm not Greek either who cares? Grape leaves, falafel, baba ghanoush, are indigenous to many parts of the world, including Greece. Go to any Greek, Lebanese, or Persian restaurant in town and all these dishes will vary slightly. Very good food and very good service in a quaint restaurant. It's worth a stop for lunch or dinner.",2
"Beware there is a significant resort charge hidden until checked in by which time it is too late. Be prepared to feel cheated and swindled! Otherwise it is a great hotel especially for the price. Also odd though is there is no self parking only valet which is free, but can take a while especially during checkout.",1
"first off, i ordered a cheese enchilada and these wasnt melted all the way on the inside nor the outside. i couldnt even stomach eating the rest. second, the wait took waaaay too long for the small order we had and it being 12 AM. i wont go here again. making sure the cheese is melted on enchilada isnt hard.",1
"The market has many variety things needed for home cook meals, but the place is not all too clean. The fruit and vegetables are not fresh but I guess if you need dry products you can get it here. It use to be Phoenix Oriental Market but things hasn't change much. Just different name and owner I believe.",1
"Well as i search for great tasting tacos, I found a great place in downtown Phoenix that is Awesome! El Chino makes excelent tacos ot to mention burritos, quesadillas and tortas.tasty meat especially the asada! Great service, great people.will be going back to taste everything in there menu lol when I get a chance.by the way the Refrito beans are the BOMB! GREAT JOB N FOOD CHINO!",2
Perfect ! Dr. Tran Is a very intelligent woman. She specializes in Astigmatism and is able to explain any questions you may have. I was finally able to get a correct prescription! The prices on the glasses and contact solution were the best of anywhere I have been Called. I fully recommend this place! The Customer service of everyone in the office from the time I walked in was great Perfect!,2
"Loved this place! Visited it with a reservation while in LV at a convention. We were there on a Monday night and it was PACKED! They specialize in Tapas and everything we had was good, or better. The food tasted very fresh which is huge for me. I also want to add we had great service. Check them out.",2
"We love this Villa. The crust of the pizza is nice and thin with a great flavor. The sauce is good and they put the right amount of toppings on the pizza. The staff is awesome and always helpful when we come in. Love love love the fingers here. They are good plain, medium or hot or they also have a sweet and sour type sauce that is really good. The ranch is also killer. Good solid pizza place.",2
"Ups n The soy lattes are the best I've ever had! n locally sourced I think n very sunny, modern, and crisp interior. Downs n pesto, fresh mozz scrambled egg crepe was a bit bland the pesto being the main offender. Keep in mind this place gets busy fast! But they also open early, even on weekends. 3.5 on the food, 4.5 on the coffee darear perfect cup o' coffee.",2
"Generally, I like BJ's, however during our last visit our beers were warm, service was slow and when we said something to our server she didn't offer to correct any of the issues and we ended up leaving to get dessert elsewhere as we were aggravated with the experience. Not the first time we have had issues with our servers here.",1
"We only drank here because we were eating at Sage. We only had one beer each because this place was very pricey. We had three Bosteele, a Fat tire and a sampler and the cost was almost 60. They do have a raw bar. Which seemed fresh. The bartender was good, not pushy and was patient with our order. If you have another choice of places to drink, go there. The PUB is a bit overrated.",1
waste of money ask thai food got a chefs idea . i guess i jus like mom and pops type of a place. maybe i try it again but was really a high end place . i order a soup and veggie rice and chicken basil . the best thing was the rice liked the veggies . the other food was bad and i paid 50 for all of it . should of went to subway,1
"My favorite place to go for home decor items! Most items are on sale ranging from 30 50 off rarely the crafts though . I am assuming that this is because HL produces their own products for home decor, so there is no third party involved. Always remember to use your 40 off one item coupon! I've definitely formed an addiction shopping here and the associates are generally helpful.",2
I enjoyed the hot dogs at Pink! Good flavor great snap on the first bite. We had the chili cheese and Chicago style dogs with fries. We were staying at Planet Hollywood during recent Christmas holiday and were able to visit twice while in Vegas. Each time food was consistent even on the late night 1am visit. I want to visit the LA locatioow.,2
"Oyster Po' Boy is simple and subtle yet delicious. Their potato salad lives up to their hype as well. On the other hand, I've been disappointed in some of their other sandwiches notably the shrimp po' boy . The bread is really good in its own way but I agree sometimes there's too much of it. Overall I'd be sad if they weren't around to give me my fried oyster fix every once in a while.",2
"While the location and decor are casual with a hole in the wall feel, the food is anything but. Tonight we had the Thai curry mussels that would rival anything you get at a top, high end restaurant. The tacos all are amazing and each have a sophisticated flare to them. I love the cheddar grits. Seafood is fresh and for a min, we forgot it was Charlotte.",2
"Wish there was an option for no stars. Food was bad! Salad bar dressing had a film on top for sitting so long. Should not be called a smoke house, I would bet they use an electric smoker and use particle board since that's what the food tasted like. Bad sause, poor tasting meat! The McRib is a better option.",1
Went here the other day to get some medicine for our cat. The pharmacist was really helpful telling us all about the different discounts we could get to pay for her medicine. Without her help we would have easily paid double for what we got. The staff here is very helpful and the customer service was amazing!,2
"Needed a rose for my 1 year anniversary. Every year I'm going to add a rose. Second thought, it might get pricy if we last 40 years, lol . Anyways, Gary, the owner helped me out. Great welcoming customer service. He upgraded my order to one of the expensive roses for free. It was beautiful. I definitely will return. Thanks, Gary!",2
We called for our original quote 6 weeks in advance of our move. We went back and forth on details and then when it was time to finalize they said they couldn't even pick up our stuff until 2 weeks after the desired delivery date. Now every other mover we talked to is also booked. We made a huge mistake by trying to work with this company.,1
"I loved the hash browns here. They were some of the best hash browns I've had. The rest of my breakfast was perfect as well. I missed the pot of bread and accidentally asked for toast instead. I then tried some of my husband's and it was so good. The staff was really friendly and so helpful. If I ever drive through Vegas again, I will try my hardest to stop here. Mmmmmm.",2
"This is one of my favorite places! I highly recommend the jalapeno cilantro hummus. I've never had anything like it and I could seriously eat it by the bucketful. The tabouli is great, too, as is the seared ahi that they serve with hummus an appetizer, I believe . My only complaint is that it gets really busy during the week at lunch. Luckily, they're great at carryout.",2
Really great for high maintenance clients like myself. The Hill Group Daniel helped with our home purchase and was willing to go the extra mile to help us purchase a home. Through all the ups and downs of home buying he was there every step and very responsive with every little thing that we had questions about. Excellent across the board. I highly recommend The Hill Group.,2
"Good cheap pizza? No. Just cheap. It was a hole in a wall literally and after renovations, it's just a clean hole in the wall. The sauce has this sweetness to it that's actually sickening and the toppings what little of it there is are over powered by the sauce's foul taste, even bacon which is usually the one overpowering other ingredients. Please pack your knives and leave.",1
Had a long day got lazy and didn't feel like making anything called up Lola's for an oyster po boy. Killer oysters great tarter actually had to take a couple oysters off because I couldn't get them in the crispy bread. Now Im thinking of going back because Im still thinking of the sandwich the next morning.,2
"These people know nothing about customer service. I had to call multiple times to get someone on the phone during office hours. They would answer the phone mid conversation and continue to help the person on the phone instead of the person in front of them. If I had a choice where to go, I would never rent from here again.",1
"If I could give them 0 stars, that would make me happy! I will never purchase anything from them ever again. They do not have the products they list in their catalog and when you order them they do not deliver! No customer service! Not helpful! I normally don't write reviews but they have made me so mad, I thought everyone should know how they treat their customers.",1
"I don't know what everyone's complaining about. It's at the mall, so it's going to be a little more pricey than an average boba shop. The guy working the register recommended the mango tango fruittea with the mango gobi. It was really delicious! The only thing I didn't like was that it was room temp. If the drink was cooler, I'd have enjoyed it more.",2
"Awful management and service! I placed an online order and it was going to take 95 minutes, I called to confirm and they said they had only one delivery driver working! They did not offer any type of compensation for future order, I will never order again. Dominoes and Pizza Hut are far better options! nWayne Gorsek",1
"Cheap! Fresh! Flavorful! nThat's the important stuff! I love trying new things and Breadfruit did not disappoint! I was a big fan of the jerk chicken, grilled plantains and fruity juices! Pros small cute setting, BYOB, 10 plate, every dish had a couple of sides that came with. Cons street parking, service can be a bit slow.",2
Didn't even get to try it. I've heard great things but i was stranded at a hotel that is just under 10 minutes away but they were insistent that it was more like 20 minutes away and refused to deliver. I had ordered online and had PREPAID a pretty generous tip. Seems like they could go an extra block or two to satisfy a paying customer.,1
"Solid bar, but only ok restaurant. I would recommend going to their other location on the west side of Madison if you would like to order food. Drink specials are pretty good. The patio is a highlight too if the weather is nice! I have a special place in my heart for Vintage because I celebrated part of my 21st birthday here. Apple pie shots on your birthday!",2
"Disappointed! This place is a half step up from a Subway. I sure it's ok for those who have not had the experience of a true New York Deli. The confusion of where to place an order was the first thing I noticed, as well as the next three unlucky customer's. A deli that does not serve fries what's up with that? Sorry Jason's Deli, you flunked the test.",1
"I used to come here at least twice a week, I used to recommend it to everyone but some thing was changed here during the last month the food is awful tasteless and the freshness disappear. nToday was my last time here.i am really upset because they were my favorite during the last year ! So sad that they can't keep up with the high level they used to have.",1
"GREAT food. awesome bar w huge fish tank gimmicks. i like the nbuilt in pro bass shop. fun cool casino staff. extremely nice comfortable rooms. the bad thing it's several miles from vegas no free shuttle anymore. also, i used to get comped rooms the new person in charge of offering them wants about 30 nite sun thurs. a 30 spot isolated from the strip w no shuttle? Meh.",1
"This is gonna be my spot to play craps, I win here for some reason, maybe because the staff is cool and I felt comfortable not like the strip casinos, I thought this was gonna be a nasty casino but its not. I don't know about the hotel rooms, but the casino is cool. I will be visiting more often during my Vegas summer vacation.",2
"Best place in town! I love Hot Yoga University! There 60 minute classes are the perfect amount of time. The studio is clean and welcoming. Often, I come early just to read because I find the studio so relaxing! The staff is the nicest group of people that I have ever met too! The teachers are friendly and helpful! I love Hot Yoga U!",2
"Great service great decor, hotel rooms are untouchable.most people say that ""your hardly gonna stay at your room why get a nice place "" well why not haha Only problem is the walk from the hotel out to the strip its like a mile in itself but this is a review on the hotel right.ill always be back to this hotel",2
"One of my favorite places to eat, in the mall. They offer a great deal with the Daily Special, however it doesn't qualify for the mall employee discount. The owner is a very nice lady! They offer great customer service, fresh, good food! I love their rice! It's the Mexican food place to eat at in the mall!",2
I do agree that the customer service inside is completely lacking. This is why I don't bother going in anymore. I just get gas and that's it. Usually the gas prices are competitive with the others in the area. The area is very tight near the pumps.where sometimes it's hard to access the ones in the middle.,1
"Played here for bingo regular casino play enjoyed my time here. Last week they had a promo where you got 300 points you get a free bottle of wine! Nice incentive to play. Gave it a four star because I didn't stay Boulder Station so I don't know what the rooms are like. The buffet was really good! Ate there twice! Overall, good hotel to get away from Strip or Downtown!",2
"Ok. Nothing special. Portions were small for the price but food was good. I've had better sushi, but I've also had worse. Service was good if you like to be checked often. I personally don't, especially when we were obviously having a business conversation. Every 5 10 minutes was ""how's everything over here "". During a 90 minute dinner, that's a lot of interruptions. You be the judge.",2
"I know this is a chain so some will always be against it. But, I love it. I've been going here for years. I think the food is great.I just love it. And I'm also very, very impressed with the service. I think the place is very well run. They must have 25 people working.seems like constant service when you need it. Overall, one of my favorites.",2
"My son turned me on to super pizza through his wood shop teacher at green valley high school. I really love their pizza ! And I have to say , I never got a crappy order from them. Even their chicken wings and fingers are awesome! Their staff is ready to please! Whatever you want, they make it ! And delivery is Free! If you like pizza this is the place !",2
"We came to Montreal for the weekend, staying in St Henri neighborhood. We wandered down Rue Notre Dame and stumbled upon this gem. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was great, and the food was delicious! I had the aubergine eggplant curry, which was incredible, and the drinks were tasty! Great for travellers, families, or dates! Casual atmosphere but still classy.",2
I am only give it two stars because they did have good guacamole. As for the rest of the food it would get 1 star. I thought it was impossible to mess up tacos but these were so bland! I even drown them in salsa to try and help them but that didn't even work. I have zero plans to go back to eat but would maybe do drinks and guacamole.,1
"First time to an America's Taco. I wasn't impressed. I will say the Horchata was delicious. nThe service was okay, the cashier was knowledgeable but they were out of Pastor so I got two Carne Asada tacos in the trio. I was told the Carne Asada is usually really good, but it was a little dry and over cooked. Maybe it was just this location. I might try another location because I love Tacos!",1
"I've been going to this place for a few years now. I've gotten the chai latte every time. Its pretty good, I'm not really that picky on the quality of my tea yet. This review is based mainly on the venue itself. I really like the atmosphere here and there are always tons of people here. I took off one star because the internet can get slow if its packed and sometimes it can be too packed.",2
"Went back today as I feel every place deserves a second chance. I was again irritated that the smallest sub I could order was an 8 "". Also I verified on the VITO there is no mention of mayo on the menu, it states it is served with Italian vinaigrette. I made sure to mention it to the girl behind the counter and she told me they put mayo on all their subs. I will not be back.",1
"The family and I love some pizza. We had Papa John's last night and it was fantastic. We had to large pizzas.one sausage with bacon bits, mushrooms, olives, and many other things on it. Um Um Good. The other pizza was sauage and pepperoni. Um Good. The bacon bit pizza was a bit tastier than just sausage and pepperoni. Thanks Papa John's for great pizza.",2
"There's your average everyday Starbucks then there's Holley's Cuppa! If you're looking for a unique selection of coffee, food, atmosphere and an incredible staff and owner in Holley.this is your place! A true hidden gem of Las Vegas worth a visit! You're guaranteed to come back! Start your day or end your night right at Holley's Cuppa m ",2
Awesome! Loved it! The wait is well worth it! The waitress Sandra is great. The cook Holoman I think was very good too. I can't wait to go back. I had the Palace Pan Roast and my bf had the u00e9touff u00e9e. Both very good. Next time I'd like to try their crab cakes and gumbo. I really wish they could expand this place so the wait wouldn't be so long though.,2
"This is the best work out plan for me. i work Monday through Friday and to have a boot camp i can do after work on my own schedule in my own apartment complex is amazing. the work out kicks my butt every time and now that it's cold outside, this the the reason i get out of the house and start working out. Keep up the great work Impact!",2
"Stayed at Mandalay for Christmas. We had 16 family members there. So many people we were limited on the choices of restaurants so we ate here. Luckily my sister casino invite cust. got us thru without waiting in the 1.5 hr line. Where to begin. the fried shrimp bad, prime rib salty, ham fair, crab legs were oka not too salty. There was nothing to eat, the spread was thin. Disappointed.",1
Love the Sierra gold in Henderson. . this one on Jones plain sucks! Takes 15 20 mins to get acknowledged at the bar. .then another 5 or 10 to Get a drink. One of very few places I've came in and sat waited and finally left. .tonight I sat at a machine plaYed forty dollars and only saw a bartender from a distance. I will never come back! !,1
"Ho hum. I've been to the original in LA and this place does not live up to the quality of the mother ship. I had a few mini chili dogs at Johnny Small's made with Pink's Dogs that gave me the taste to try this place, Indifferent staff, pricey dogs, and not so clean space. Had a chili dog on a nice stale bun. I'll stick to Johnny Small's or wait for trips to LA.",1
Walked in.was able to order the lunch special.got our miso soup and the bowls the soup were in were completely filthy. Gunk crusted on the outside of both of our bowls. We told the sever and he made excuses. We canceled our order and left. Oh and this place doesn't know what air conditioning is apparently.,1
"Very good restaurant in the Bellagio. The food was quite tasty and the decor was simple, but nice. The service was somewhat disappointing as we had to ask our server for the pre theater menu that they promote outside and on the website. The other servers were promoting this menu, but not ours I guess because it was cheaper than the other prix fixe menu being offered.",2
The stars are for the burgers! Sometimes you have to wait in line but the burgers are like home made and the guy serving them is a throwback to when people had customer service and a personality. Every time I go it's for the burgers and not the gambeling. Besides they closed the hotel portion anyway.,2
"I've been going to Danny's for over a year now and have received over a dozen cuts here. Every barber, with a couple of exceptions, does a good job for the most part. Much better then any other place I've been to. I think I'm the only white guy who goes here, but I'll continue to get my cuts at Danny's.",2
"I USE TO go here a lot.always left a good tip 15 20 . But my LAST trip there, killed it with bad service again!. . Ordered the usual sushi and chicken on a stick. Got my sushi but no chicken, no refills nothing. asked about it and was told it's on it's way.didn't get my chicken till I was about to leave. Won't be going back anytime soon bad service 3 times back to back!?.pft",1
"I'm not a huge fan of Au Bon Pain in general, but this one in particular is the worst. I walked in to find every employee on their phone, yelling across the store to eachother. Worse, yet, the entire store, from the door way, smelled of vomit. I made it to the line, but had to turn around as the smell was so pungent. I cannot speak to the product, but I can say, I would never go in there again.",1
"Do not be fooled by the old pictures of the Bibimbap like I was! Those are YEARS old! They do not serve this anymore. This is just a chicken fast food joint now. Sorely disappointed. The food wasn't worth the trip at all. The place has only a few tables, was filthy, and had only 2 staffers working during the lunch rush.",1
"Good chinese takeout here, seems to be hard to find. This is the Hoho Cherry House. The Hoho China Bistro is no more, but I heard it moved here. The lunch specials are a good value, but the food here is right about average. General Tso's is OK. This is more along the lines of a Panda Express, but mom and pop owned. For that, I expected more. Nothing to rave about, but not terrible either.",1
"Leticia's USE to be a great place for Mexican food, unfortunately no longer. The service is very slow and sporadic at best. The food lately has been just ok, and the quality has definitely gone down hill. We enjoy eating at local places, non chains and are very disappointed in the direction this restaurant is going.",1
"Well I must start by saying that I LOVE Two Hippies Tacos but their pizza is awful. We tried both pizza crusts and did not enjoy either. The sauce is awful too, you can only taste bell peppers. They do offer some interesting topping combination's though. We will not return even though it is around the corner from our house. Come on Hippies, I know you can do better than this.",1
"Great hotel! I stayed in the standard 2 double bed room on the penthouse floor. The best part about Sofitel is that they pay attention to the little details to make it feel like a luxury hotel. The linens are comfortable, the rooms are large, and the views from the penthouse room are great. I would definitely stay at the Sofitel again.",2
"I you've read any other bad reviews, believe it. This place sucks! They're just here to get most out of you. Warranty's not legit. They'll figure out a way to go around it. I suggest Costco or discount tires. Taking advantage of an already sucky situation. Don't bother calling main office. They suck too!",1
"Earl's I have eaten at on several different occasions. The lunch crowd is loud and noisy. The bar area is hoping in the evenings. nAside from that, the service is usually prompt and efficient. They have floor managers who check up on you often. All around okay and the food is more than decent. No wifi is a bummer.",2
"Everything i tried here was excellent. If my polish friend says this is the only polish place her mother will eat at, then i know it's good. And i'm not kidding when i say everything on the menu tastes authentic and loved. The places is also very cool hidden in old montreal, it has a unique charm. The piano adds warmth and the awesomely cute sexy and nice waitresses makes it a pleasant experience.",2
 6.99 steak Eggs graveyard special. I Know why it's that price. worst steak ever . had 2 bites and my jaw was sore from chewing. eggs were OK. Bread choices were limited to white or wheat. spend a few bucks more and go elsewhere . but Idid love watching the drunk wasteoides from drai's eating there at 5 am,1
"Super easy to get on guest list. Pretty awesome that they have free vodka for girls. I actually liked that they had burlesque dancers on display. I did not however like that they wanted to charge 18 dollars for 3 waters! When a drunk asks for water, charging that much is going to result in some puking up in your club.",1
"We used to love this place.about 2 years ago. It has gone downhill fast. The food is mediocre at best and the service is just awful. Servers are inattentive and there appears to be no manager.ever. We frequently saw the owner getting drunk at the bar, guess that explains everything! Too bad because the beer menu is awesome but there's no other reason to go.",1
"Having been to the Henderson location a few times I guess I expected better at their vegas location. Service was very slow but friendly. Took a loooong time to be served. I had the steak supreme tacos, I rate them as a 2 star taco. The meat had a very strange texture. The rice was nasty and the retried beans were runny and tasted flat.",1
"I have to admit i'm a fan. The place is awesome, great establishment, large booths, and a friendly staff. The food is great too, if you get specific items, I found that when they say ""hearty chunks "" of meat, its usually not the case, most items are soupy and over sauced, but its really yummy and you get a lot for what you pay for.",2
"If you like Thai cuisine, you owe it to yourself to try this place. We order lunch from here once a week at the office. Great food and service. I especially like the Lunch Specials, and for me the Spicy Mint Chicken spicy levels 1 10 but I order a 20 is the bomb. In store service is great with friendly staff. Try it out and say 'Number One' recommended you.",2
"What a crazy show! I thought it was going to be louder than it was. But the loudest part was before the show even started when all of the kids were banging on the pots and pans. I loved the ""totally random cookie time "". My cousin's kids had a blast and so did the adults! The theater was a little old, but the show made up for it.",2
ok so I walked here because of the reviews in regards to the pizza buffet.I was sad when the waitress told me they don't do that anymore and it's now Thai with some American food. I was starving so I settled for the Philly Cheese Steak. OMG! very good and a heaping stack of amazing French fries. pleasantly surprised that I can have all this in Vegas for about 8.,2
"I will not return to this restaurant. The service being the main reason. The servers seemed unorganized and out waitress hardly ever checked in on us. Food took an inordinate amount of time to receive and the order was wrong when it arrived. Taco Bell includes more meat in a taco than what I had. nThe salsas were good, and our chips were fresh but this is an easy ""pass. """,1
Happened to be in the area with some time to kill. I dropped in and was serviced immediately. The salon was very clean and there is a nice selection of polish. The nail tech was very careful about the cuticles that were dry and cracked. The tech did an incredible job and I would definitely recommend them to anyone.,2
"This place is great for happy hour. As one review noted, the staff is very friendly, and if it's a little past 6 30, they'll let you squeeze one more drink in! Appetizers are so so, small portions, but cheap during happy hour, so why not! Great for a get together. Great service. Good happy hour menu. I've never tried dinner here, and never really thought to!",2
"Best drinks at the Chandelier room! Go here if you want to feel like you're in a boutique hotel or a speak easy. They are super inventive, they make their own cherry coke and put leather infused something or other into a drink. Also their service is outstanding. This place is so good, I went here every night when I was in Vegas. Yup, that good.",2
"Sarah is amazing at Lifequest. I am a nail technician and tend to get a lot of knots in my neck and shoulder and she just knows how to work them. I walk out feeling like a new person every time. Sarah is a very knowledgable masseuse, she knows her stuff. If u are a nail tech or work in a similar field, she is your girl.",2
"You would think fried chicken would be simple. Absolutely horrible. A night visit only added insult to injury. 3 waitresses and still had to return one drink for lack of alcohol. If you want to shoot pool, go during the day, otherwise, stay clear! nPS I had to remind them of the ""drink "" to get it removed from the bill.",1
"i really hated the server and the food has really gone down hill. In the past this was my local go to steak house. I called and spoke with the maitre'd and explained the situation she replied "" I can believe it many patrons feel the same way about this particular server "" WOW.EVEN THE MANAGERS KNOW HOW TERRIBLE THIS SERVER IS. I",1
"The savory crepes are the star here. The staff is not. My main issue with it is that they act a bit put out if you don't know their routine and they were also very distracted the last time I was there, with each other. nI have been there over a dozen times as it has a nice patio area where you can sit with your coffee and crepe and read.",1
I got help from this shop back in 8 2014 and i had a serious problem with my rack and pinion it had broken completely off from my frame. I job like this coast least 1k and i called around to many shops. Benny gave me a great price and allow me to bring in my own part. I would recommend his shop to my family and friends !,2
"Very disappointed eating here after all the great reviews. We had a shrimp nachos dish which was huge, but was very bland had no flavor. Most of the cheese was not even melted. We also had a southwestern chicken taco salad which had a bad flavor and did not taste fresh. This was the worst Mexican food we ever had. Beware.",1
"An entirely over priced and pedestrian menu, inept management and lackluster service combined with a very noisy environment, four 4 ounce wine pours, a pompous and unfriendly jerk trying to pass as a sommelier and unacceptably long drink times all add up to a place to be avoided at all cost. Don't waste your time or money.",1
"This review is for breakfast only. I happened to be in the neighbourhood and came upon this kitschy diner and deli on the famous St. Catherine's street. Most breakfasts come with coffee or tea and they have early bird specials. You will find a good mix of locals and tourists dining side by side in harmony. My food was decent, service was friendly and prompt. This place is a must try!",2
"If I was sent a ""Dine with us for free "" coupon for 4 people, I would not return. The place was loud, full of kids, and the ""steakburger "" really was both small and lacked flavor. To add, the chili was perhaps the worst I have ever had in my life tasteless, no punch and watery. I could not find the exit fast enough. What a complete distaster.",1
"I am so happy at Camden Pecos Ranch Apartments. I've been here a year after leaving a terrible complex in Ahwatukee. I love this area. I feel extremely safe. It's quiet, pleasant, and everyone is helpful. The trash valet is nice, no more hauling my trash to a dumpster all the time. The apartments are nicely renovated to make it feel very much like a home and super well laid out.",2
"This place is for folks that like AYCE and don't care about the quality of the sushi. nI didn't think there was anything really good about this place. The fish didn't taste fresh, obvious frozen. Not sure where they learn how to to slice sashimi, but the fish were not thinly sliced. they looked like scrap pieces and was not appetizing at all. Would not recommend going here unless",1
Same crowd as Rain.it just gets an extra star because the dj was playing better music and of course for the excellent Vegas view. Other than that this place sucks. People are rude.I'd figured that drunken Midwesterners would still have manners but that was not the case. Some girl spilled her wine all over some of the girls in our group and some big guy stepped on my friend's toe.nice!,1
"Papa Johns Pizza says it all. I was in the mood for fast pizza and gave this place and their pizza a shot. I have had Pap Johns in the past but nothing in recent memory as I like to try other local joints than big chains most of the time. So, overall it was what I remembered, OK, nothing special and it met the need for fast pizza.",1
"I can't say enough about this bank and this branch. No ATM fees ever. Extended Saturday hours and open on SUNDAY! Everyone knows your name. David one of the personal bankers is amazing. Helpful, personable and even made opening an account for my kids an educational and fun experience. Truly a community bank with a personal focus.",2
"Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. They finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay. So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. Yes, I had to TRY and give them money. On to the important part. Food was terrible. I had a burger and it was pathetic.",1
My favorite coffee shop in Phoenix! Small and intimate with a beautiful dog friendly patio. The staff is so nice and helpful. They always have the highest excellence of coffee and pastries. Love all the Staff here. Such a comfortable great place My favorite is their Carmel macchiato! Oh and they have almond milk!,2
"From someone born and raised in Vegas I was not impressed, not sure how or why the Lvrj gave them an award for best bar food, it was definitely not the best I've had. I'm giving them two stars for a cool atmosphere and I like the old Vegas pics but not the best spot for food, maybe just for a drink and to hang out.",1
"Wow, surprised at how good the steaks were! Wasn't expecting it too be this good. Yes, its in the Rivera but still the service was good and the steaks were really good! Compared to the better steak houses in the more ""popular strip "" steakhouses its more affordable especially with the Groupon deal. I would recommend coming here at the very least for the steaks and old Vegas feel!",2
"El S u00e1bado fue el u00faltimo d u00eda que voy a ese lugar donde estaban cobrando 10. 5 se me hac u00edan mucho esta ves solo entre xq tra u00eda amigos que vinieron de Salt Lake City Utah. Es rid u00edculo que cobren para entrar. Pira u00f1a, Share o cualquier otro gay bar no cobran entrada y son mucho mejor lugares que este. Por lo pronto no vuelvo a este lugar al menos que cambien esto.",1
"We spent the whole day in the car, got turned around in Montreal, and were so hungry and cranky at 11pm that the food didn't matter. We were so lucky to find a great place. we honestly settled on the closest, well reviewed place still serving food. Amazing food, a friendly wait staff, and delicious cocktails. Not to mention quick service. One of the highlights of my time in Montreal!",2
"Checked this place out this past weekend. Service and food are magnificent. Started out with their Tzatziki and pita. So fresh and best I've ever had. For the main course I went with the classic Gyro. Amazing. Again, fresh and best I've ever had. Their Baklava and Galaktobouriko are delicious. You get complimentary Loukoumades donut holes if you go on Sundays ",2
"This place is a scam. Breezy has poor customer service she'll hang up on you and show you no respect. I bought a groupon through her and booked the appointment in advance she waited for it to pass didn't call me or text me at all not even ""As she was waiting and waiting for two hours "" and now wants to charge me DOUBLE as in 97 to make an appointment. Do not waste your time!",1
I love their Yin Yang chicken burger. I have had it multiple times. I tried their caramel pretzel shake too. That was simplt awesome. A must try. nI will return back for good food and service. nI am giving this place 4 starts because every time I had to wait for at least 45 mins in the waiting line. No other reason.,2
"Crash. Sunday nights at 6pm in the Chapel. Scott Savage and Dr., Maxie Burch trade off teaching on real life, practical, applicable ways that we Love, Think and Serve like Christ. Lots of small groups, Bible Studies, and other ways to get involved. Great workout facility in the Family Life Center that only costs 30 month with no contracts. Overall, just a fantastic community of people!",2
"The coffee is fine, I stop into this location several times a week simply because I work in this mall.the service however, is slow. They're all mostly nice. But it should not take you 10 minutes to give me my grande latte when I'm the only person in the store. Also, I'm in there, as i said, several times a week and I always order the same thing.they have yet to remember me and I wear a nametag.",1
"Broth is highly uninspired. Meat is tough, and the cost for the pho is higher than city standard by 2 per bowl. no kid size bowls. Bun is minimal serving meat is boiled and then grilled, not marinated, and veggies are sparse. Noodles used are kinda like spaghetti than vervacelli noodles. Avoid with prejudice.",1
Whimsical and homy feel for comfort! I absolutely love that they offer ALMOND MILK for lattes! Their Curry Chicken wrap was delicious! It is the perfect place to meet with friends or get caught up on school work. The owners are always gracious and the service is a reflection of that. My favorite coffee spot by far!,2
"Atmosphere is great. Food portions for the Tacos is extremely small. More like an appetizer. Waiter seemed disappointed that we only ordered water and iced tea for drinks instead of an alcoholic beverage at 11 a.m.! . Can't believe a Mexican Restaurant charges for chips and salsa with the prices of the food. No extras come with what you order no rice, no beans for expensive lunch. Won't be back.",1
"First off the front door was locked, we were somehow ""supposed "" to know not to use it and to go around the back. Theo one actually wanted to help us at the counter. When someone finally did ask us what we wanted, it took FOREVER. And all we got was boring old ice cream. The place seemed cool on the inside but we didn't feel at all welcomed and won't be going back.",1
"I eat here once a year or two. It is always good. Sometimes the wait can be a bit long because it is very popular. This is a great place for groups and because of this, it can be pretty noisy. Love their thin chips and good, spicy salsas. I ordered the street tacos and they were delicious. All of my dining partners were quite satisfied with their meals. Pretty decent prices, too.",2
"I was impressed with this mechanic shop because they were kind and priced my alternator job consistently. I had left their original quote at home and when I arrived at the shop they used their program to come up with the same fair price as before. It was quick, clean, and quality work. Plan to come back for my suspension job based on how well they did. Thank you!",2
"This place is definitely a must visit in Vegas! Tucked off the strip, but still right there, it feels like a Fremont street without being downtown or ghetto. I am impressed with their use of unused space, and will definitely have to visit again! We rode the high roller, which was amazing, and then strolled thru the street amongst the wide selection of bars shops.",2
"This is my ""Go To "" place for hot dogs. It's right around the corner, the Vienna Beef dogs are awesome! I've always had great service there and the food has always been delicious. Your opions close by Sonic and DQ are a notch below. Check the hours before you head over, I missed them by about an hour once. bummer!",2
I feel bad writing this review. I was really excited to try these cupcakes with filling. The staff was very nice but the cupcakes were gross. They tasted artificial to me. Maybe the same as or a step above a grocery store. I really wanted to like this place but I threw away most of the cupcakes after 1 bite. I felt like it was a huge waste of money. Sorry.,1
My dad and I went there for dinner tonight and It was a pleasant surprise. The food was very good and there was a lot of it. So we left full and happy. I really liked the customer service the older lady was very nice. Highly recommend this if you want to grab a quick bite. We ordered the Mongolian beef and it was awesome.,2
"Kandy and the Snapdragon crew have been taking care of me for at least 5 years and I couldn't be happier. The salon features modern design elements and is very clean. The staff are always very friendly and appointments are on time. My hair looks great, what else can I say? BOTTOM LINE Definitely a cut above the rest!",2
"I am worried that they are already opening a second location, especially since it's so close to the original. Love the carne asada tacos. Hate the parking situation. Love the mom an pop atmosphere. And I love the fact that I can ride my bike there, not have to worry about parking, have a couple cold beers on a Friday night and relax.",2
Coworker and I went for lunch. Absolutely packed and the food was just ok. My hotdog was like something you would get at him. Regular bun and dry with a cheap weiner in it. My buddy got the gyro. Agaiothing to write home about. I got a great dog off the cart off the street that was cheaper that this place.,1
"This review is for breakfast. If I could give them no stars I would. We had a party of eight, which I understand can take slightly longer but there was such a lack of, really anything, service and food included. We waited for 45 minutes while about 16 other people got sat, finally sat down at a table were not even acknowledged for about 15 minutes and then left. Wast of time.",1
Been here quite a few times but this time it seemed like a lot changed the food taste especially. Service was very good.but food didn't seemed to do justice to the name of the place! Papdi chat had very less papdi and was okay. Gobi manchurian speciality earlier was tasting oily.the Mysore masala dosa lacked the red chutney inside n overall taste but the spinach dosa was the saving grace!,1
"I eat here at least once a week. It is delicious, and cheap. You can't beat a lunch for under 5. The spring rolls and the 12 beef pho are good if you're looking for a basic meal. The cafe sua da is delicious, but you have to be patient for the coffee to drip down. If you're looking to test your manliness, challenge yourself with 54.",2
Such an amazing dinner! I ordered the filet and let me tell you that it is hands down the best steak I've ever eaten here in Las Vegas. It literally melted in my mouth and was cooked to perfection. My baked potato was super great and had a wonderful cheese sauce! Next time I'm in Vegas I will be back!,2
Used to be my go to nail place. Today I was treated poorly and lied to. Was told one price and charged another. My big toe is throbbing right now because of the half ass pedicure. Paid extra for callus removal. clearly still rough skin on my feet. Not happy. Will not return or send anymore business their way.,1
"Brickhouse has been on my list to try for several months and after finally getting the opportunity it was not hit. The sides, mac n cheese and greens, were better than the meat. The ham was dry and ribs tasted like they have been warmed over for the past couple of days. Was definitely hoping for better.",1
"Ordered some Pho Ga and summer rolls to go the other night. Yummy broth and lots of chicken. The summer rolls were fresh, and the peanut sauce was yummy. I am spoiled with Pho having lived in Seattle and Portland the past several years rainy cities have the best pho , but really. I was impressed. I will be back!",2
"Sold me the world's worst phone without telling me the Droid was comming out in 2 weeks. Stuck with a Samsung SEGA for another 6 months. Does all tech stuff great. Sucks as a phone. Can't hear, drops calls repeatedly, could be Verizon's Network too . I can't wait to get rid of it and possible Verizon too.",1
We just ate at PF Chang's tonight and I seriously can't believe the amount of food that was on the table. It was seasoned well and piping hot. Our server was very attentive actually saving our 3 year old from eating a hot pepper on the calamari which they comped us because the chicken wraps came out after the kids' meals .,2
Picture says it all.ha this place is awful. To call it a dive does dives a dis service. Probably the least appealing place I have ever been unfortunate enough to spend any time in. On a pub crawl with Owen.C to find Leiths biggest dive I feel we hit the mark here! The funniest thing was the wedding reception going on there and a 60th birthday.! Hialrious!,1
"This place was actually recommended to me by my girlfriend.yikes. However, as a reviewer previously noted the prices are sky high and the service is mediocre. It would help if they told you they don't take your insurance and are going to charge you 75 dollars your first visit as a cash off the street patient. I doubt I will go back.",1
"Quoted us 20 mins ETA for our food. Didn't get it till almost 1 hour later. Weak portion, extremely pretentious presentation.had to go next door at the croissant place to get more food. Furthermore it does not take an hour to smear nutella on a crepe and add some sliced bananas on top. Neither should it take any more time to add some weird lemon ""gel "" and butter on a crepe. So disappointed.",1
"Stay the hell away. Bad service, slow service, all you do is wait wait wait complain, and wait some more. I can't tell you how miserable we all were waiting over an hour for our food to come out. When it did, it was not fresh and was definitely not good. MGM restaurant management needs to send in some help on this one.",1
"Went here for lunch.sat at the bar with my husband and ordered sushi for me and Hawaiian breakfast for him. From a very rude service, we felt unwelcome and almost as if we were bothering the waitress, to very very chewy seaweed, low quality ingredients and supplies and semi dirty place. Would not recommend!",1
We stopped in for a late night snack and cocktail. First impression was the restaurant is beautiful! Best part was the excellent service provided by Veronica. She was so pleasant and attentive with a smile on her face at 2am. We had the chicken strips which were tasty and the lemon drop cocktail. To top it off we had creme brule for dessert which was yummy!,2
"Andrew here said it best "". food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily. "" It took me 40 minutes to get a sandwich here, and when I complained I didn't get an apology, just a snarky remark ""well you can see we have a small kitchen """,1
"Yummy Thai food! The Panang curry was silky and luscious, although we would have liked to been asked our spice preference we just like our curries hot! . Definitely a small complaint. They did the basics like potstickers and pad thai really well. There aren't a lot of thai places on the strip, and this was a welcome find.",2
"The best pizza in Avondale Goodyear, bar none. They occasionally go overboard on toppings, but who is complaining? The Greek and Fat Hawaiian specialty pizzas are great. The wings are good, too. Try the 9 1 1 wings if you like heat. The service is generally attentive. Rob is the best wait person. PBR bottle specials are a plus.",2
"Habib is fantastic. The best tailor in Vegas! And he does handbag and leather repairs too! I've sent many friends to him, we are all pleased with the quality of his work. Me, being 5'2 , I always need my pants and skirts hemmed. His work is flawless and lasts through washes over the years! Love this place",2
"My string of visiting exceptional coffee houses over the last week continues, this time in Phoenix. Lux bills itself as a micro roaster. It is that, as well as a great place to work, network, meet friends old and new. A great find in Phoenix! If I continue to travel for work, Lux will be a must visit stop when in Phoenix! I recommend the House Special Black White Latte.",2
"food is ok, pretty good actually. I used to get to go often. I stopped coming due to the rude hostess. Husband wanted all you can eat and was tired of our usual lunch spot, omg never again! This hostess is awful, rubbed her wet hand on my back. WTH? Mimicked me with an annoying voice when I asked for tea? REALLY? that's it NEVER AGAIN",1
"This is a nice looking building in a not so nice area. They have two Coca Cola Freestyle machines and a self serve ICEE machine. Looked promising but we didn't see chicken fries on the menu, and never got a chance to ask because we stood there for about 5 minutes and no one bothered to greet us. So we left.",1
"Went for lunch. If your local have a rewards card it's half off. 12 a person m f. Service was very good, food was good, a lot of choices, I was surprised at the overall experience, good quality nice people. A lot different then I remember or what people are saying. The desserts are really good, that's not my thing.",2
"Overpriced subpar food. Paid 19 for scrambler and 2 small glasses of milk. The scrambler was burnt. The waiter that brought the food asked ""if she could get us anything else "", I asked for hot sauce, she then pointed me in the direction of the condiments stand I.e. Get it yourself. I'm glad I tipped for that great service. They had no potatoes, how does a breakfast place run out of potatoes?",1
"This location is not going to last long. The Classic Burger 13 was terrible. The waitress said it was Angus, tasted more like cheap ground. Pasta was mediocre. Save your money, go to Island's or Claim Jumpers. Best part of dinner was the dessert. Can't mess up a brownie and ice cream too much. PH need to step up the quality. They can't ride cn celebrity name forever.",1
"I'm a pizza person. Normally when I'm in Vegas the only pizza I eat is from the frozen section of trader joe's. however, I recently found this hidden little gem. It might be the closest to ny pizza I've had in Vegas, and it's pretty darn good. Round, Sicilian, pizghetti sandwich, zucchini sticks.everything surprised me. Bc who knew Vegas has a good pizzeria?! Happily, now, I know.",2
"Small but confident menu. The fries were outstanding, perhaps only cheesewiz could make them better. Natural cut and crispy. The Ruben was outstanding. The burger was gone before another word was spoken, and the Sirloin Steak wasn't the most tender, but made up with great, well seasoned taste. I'll definitely be going here again, perhaps to try breakfast.",2
Been here only two times and both times were for bachelor parties! Epicness! We reserved for more than 10 people and can accomodate even more if needed. Service is quick and the entertainment is well. entertaining! Nothing but a taste of some almost real oktoberfest in good ole las vegas! OI OI OI !,2
"Went here, was buzzed, got more buzzed. Opened a tab, paid cash, was concerned about it after considering my condition. Checked the bill a few days later, spot on. To be honest with their billing, and have semi cheap drinks, i'm a fan. Theres also a chance for guys to meet girls here when its like a Thur Sun in the evenings. nTwo thumbs up, honest establishment!",2
"Good southern food, especially by Vegas standards. Awesome ambience and friendly service. Prices are great and even better during happy hour goes till 7 30 . Half price appetizers! I especially recommend the oysters. Half dozen starting only at 4! Hear they have live music on the weekends. Will be back to check it out.",2
"Normally I am not a big hamburger eater and I don't care for fast food. Cruzers advertises Fresh Ground Burgers so hubby and I decided to give it a try. We were very happy with the food it was fresh, made to order and not a burger just sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be ordered. It was a refreshing change from the frozen pressed patties other places serve. We will be back for more. YUMMY",2
"Fantastic tacos with meat fresh off the grill for 2.50 a piece. My favorite tacos to date. It's fun eating them while just loitering around the outdoor grill. Also, it is attached to a lovely little Mexican grocery. Try out some of the candies in the back of the store I recommend the chilli covered mangos, prunes, or tamarinds!",2
"If I could rate 0 stars, I would. Slow service, my Godzilla tails were cold on first delivery. On return, they were microwaved and tougher than beef jerky. The waitress did not apologize or take them off the bill. Who manages this place anyway. Used to be a favorite, but last two visits have been epic failures. Sucky!",1
"Honestly, I have gone to this dermatologist several times. I didn't feel like any of the doctors actually cared about my situation. Everytime I have gone, I wait 30 mins in a room, when the doctor comes in, he spends maybe 2 minutes with me before prescribing some pill and sends me on my way. Awful experience",1
Old Time Pottery rocks and this location is no exception. They have anything and everything you could ever want for the best prices. I got some amazing curtains and a unique wall mirror for my apartment. If I ever need something from decor to kitchen accessories this is my first stop. Don't let the name decieve you. its not a pottery place.,2
"Went for first time today. nWas a very good experience. nWhile it is true I have had better refried beans, the fish taco and carnita taco I had on the combination plate were great. Lots of food and good fresh food. nService was quick and friendly. nI am definitely putting this place on a have to go at least once a month basis.",2
"We enjoyed the windmill location so we figure we would give this one a shot since it's closer to home. Walked in and was not greeted very politely by the host. Almost as if we were a nuisance. So we left. I guess my money isn't good at this location. Oh well, enjoyed Archies thai food better anyway.",1
"Stayed at the Walper across the street and was suggested this place for good Canadian craft beer. Beers were just what we were looking for, and the chirchirillo and hummas were very good. Had a great time shooting the U.S. You Know what at the bar, and would suggest this place to anyone over crappy mainstream beer.",2
"We have been using Charter internet for almost a year. Aside from a glitch or 2 with installation, the service has been steady and good. When I was having difficulty with connecting a couple of months ago, I was really annoyed. My troubleshooting pointed to the router as the problem I didn't want to, but I bought a new router. Everything has been fine since.",2
Went in to pick up something to go because I heard the food was great. Boy were they right! The staff was very friendly and helpful and the place was really cool. You would never know you were in the middle of a parking lot of a strip mall. So cool! Best roast beef sandwich ever. Can't wait to go back and try the coffee and other menu items. Thanks 32 Shea!,2
"4 stars for the location, the high food quality, and the large menu selection. nHowever, in my opinion they need to work on the service which could be better. Ok that it's just breakfast, but the customer always needs to feel welcome. Anyway, I had a biscuits and gravy plate with eggs, bacon, and potatoes. And a large cappuccino. Simply delicious.",2
First time here but confused about the bad reviews. Some people are just too hard to please I guess. Service was excellent and everything on my plate was robust with flavor. I had the Mar Y Tierra which was pretty damn good. The charro beans had some awesome spices I couldn't quite peg. The salsa trifecta was VERY good. I'll be coming back next time in town. I enjoyed the friendly staff.,2
No french fries strike one nWaitresses are pretty but really slow not rude but indifferent. nThey decided to clean the floor around us with a huge amount of bleach gross fumes nMy torta de pierna was delicious but not so much so that it makes me want to come back. nSorry. I just had a bad enough experience to not want to come back.,1
"i really like joe's crab shack i ate here 2 or 3 time and it's the best seafood i ever had in las vegas i know it's a big franchise but it's better then a lot of big restaurants in las vegas it reminds of Key West, FL and they have the best clam chowder in las vegas if you want seafood and your in las vegas go to Joe's Crab Shack.",2
"If you want real food and real service this is the go to spot, little longer wait than San Diego but worth it. You have to split plates especially in vegas or you draggin around a doggie bag. Kids do the pancakes I cant say no to the chicken and waffles and a BLT bloody mary. For the food quailty and portions the prices are great. nBe careful ordering the portions are huge.",2
"Holy God this took forever! I get pissed and stand up to realize my food just chilling behind the counter. Fries, cold as fuck, that's OK, they're nasty as ass anyway. The best part is there's a little ticket that shows what time the order was done.5 mins it sat there. Chuckbox. Always. Never forget.",1
"I don't get it. Martini was not very good. But i didn't complain. So, Why then the attitude from the bartender lady? Some people just look pissed to be serving you, and would rather talk with their bar backs than interact. Whatever, that is why you are getting 2 stars. Sushi, not that great either. Next time, I'm going to Kona, for, if nothing else, less attitude.",1
I love fuku. All of their burgers are declines and affordable. They also always try different menu items like a chicken Katsu loco moco. Their fries are delicious too. I honestly love each of their burgers and I believe they are like 5 6 bucks each. Definitely some of the best burgers in town and they're coming off of a truck.,2
"This place advertised itself as a top 10 Thai restaurant in America. LOL. I doubt it would even be top 10 in Pittsburgh. The food was extremely bland, the prices were too high, the spiciness was sorely lacking, and the portions were too small. Will not be going back and will continue my search for good Thai food in Pittsburgh.",1
"This hotel was by far one of the best ones I have ever been to! The rooms are amazing and very spacious, and the restaurants are very delicious. The hotel service was very quick and efficient, and it made the trip a lot more stressful! This was definitely one of my best vacations because it was nice coming back to a place I really enjoyed.",2
Came here for a private lesson for two with my boyfriend. I was a little concerned that the place would be packed with macho guys that would make me even more hesitant to confess that I had minimal archery skills.but the instructors Gabe and Jessica were so nice and helpful. We will definitely be back!,2
Since my last review my husband and I had been here a few times without any further issues of finding hair in our food. My husband picked this up for dinner on Friday and I've been deathly ill since about two o'clock Saturday morning. 37 hours of extreme food poisoning and counting. I'll never go back.,1
"Sams town,Is beautiful.Great atmosphere.Very friendly staff.You definetly will not go thirsty here,Waitresses are always comming around. We ate dinner and breakfast at the buffet.we were not disapointed.The food was wonderful.The machines are loose. nWill definetly stay at Sams town again.Personally I thought they had the nicest rooms in Las Vegas.",2
"I ordered takeout. Spicy rolls were very spicy, soup portion was really small as was the cucumber salad which is to die for. They deliver but expect to wait if you call during peak hours. nI hate trying sushi when I'm away from home but I was more than satisfied with this restaurant. I recommend it to every friend who visits Vegas. Everyone must try the cucumber salad!",2
Great place for a quick alcohol or cigar purchase. They have nice humidor with a decent selection of cigars from in expensive to high dollar. HUGE selection of nearly any liquor or beer you can think of. I love the build your own 6 pack option they give you. plus they carry my new favorite black rum.Kraken,2
"The buffet at the M resort is so bad it almost made me SICK ! The waitress told me it was good when it first opened. I went here on the recomendation of a waitress at Main Street Station casino, proof that locals are not that hip in Las Vegas. The only saving grace at this disgusting buffet is the free beer and wine",1
"Officially our new hang out spot. We have been the last 3 Saturdays in a row! The atmosphere is great and we love the live music. Plus, 65 beers on tap and great food! They also rotate the bands nicely.each Saturday out of the last 3 they have had a different band. The one last night was great.never seen a lead singer play the drums before!",2
I made an appointment for a mammogram. I arrived 10 minutes before my appointment to fill out paperwork. When I walked in there were at least 15 people in the waiting area.not a good sign. My name was promptly called at 8 30. I was brought back to the changing room and then to the exam room. By 8 50 I was back in my car headed home. I will always go here for my mammograms.,2
"Have done plenty of business with BlackSheep over the years, and have to say these guys rock. Whether your bringing your late model car in for tune up or fully restoring your classic ride, this is your shop. The staff is friendly, professional, and well informed in all automotive areas. Prices are extremely fair, you won't get ripped off here. Hands down one of the best in town.",2
It's a very nice gym. Kept very clean and you can go whenever you want to. People are nice and friendly and it feels very safe. Only drawbacks are going to be 1 it's not very big 2 it doesn't have classes and 3 they kind of are Nazis about the swipe cards and only allowing one person in the gym at a time.,2
This buffet sucked! You'd be better off going to Hometown Buffet. The Rio and Mirage buffets are still far better than this dive. The design and atmosphere is simplistic and strange. They could have made this place much more Romanequese. It may have beeamed after a Roman God but the food and atmosphere wasn't even good enough for mere mortals like us.,1
I'm not sure how many times I've been to Vegas but this is my first time visiting the sign. I was surprised to see there was a little small parking lot to stop at so you don't have to worry about where to park. The people in line were really cool and patient. I think people took like 3 pictures and no one rushed anyone. It was a beautiful day and made for some nice photos. Good times!,2
Absolutely appalled at the ill mannered staff! My father always stops by and purchases a few cigars when he is in town. He goes in today and gets accused of stealing! Because his hands were in his pocket. Excuse me it's cold outside! Was he not the right color? How did your staff member feel when he told my father to empty his pockets and nothing was there? DISGRACEFUL!,1
BORING! Not a single pole in the place so the girls amble on to the stage as if they just woke up. They walk from one side of the stage to the next doing nothing because they might trip and break the ankle. There is no pole on the stage thus nothing to hold on to to try to bust some moves. This place is pretentious and over priced. The girls there have no talent and don't really care.,1
"The pizza crust was a little bland but not a bad pizza all around. Their burger was a meatloaf marinaded sort of beef that just wasn't to my liking, and the bun was toasted on the top and hard as stone. It actually made the roof of my mouth sore. I thought the drinks were high so I just got one at 11. I can't give them more than 2 stars, sorry.",1
"unfortunately all the bad reviews lived up to the hype.being that it was my first time here it certainly will be my last, let's just say sizzler has a better buffet than here, the only thing that probably saved my not so great experience was the chicken dish and that was it, everything else was just screaming cafeteria! Please don't waste your money",1
CLOSES EARLY WITHOUT NOTICE. Says 4 6pm happy hour but arrived at 5 29 and it's closed. Best Car Wash In Town. Very Detailed Cleaning. Always tip these guys they spend about 10min. on your car drying and cleaning it. TV And couches INSIDE. But plan on it taking about 30min. and maybe longer if busy.,1
"There was nothing that we found impressive about this dining establishment. From the cold environment to the lackluster service it is certainly not the best that pittsburgh has to offer. To expand upon our experience, the only thing worthwhile were the oysters on the half shell. The rest was a disappointment, from the SOKU block tuna to the ""olive garden "" style gnocchi there is no saving grace.",1
"Always exceptional service. Food is always fresh and orders arrive correctly. We eat here on average a couple times a month and have been for a few years now. The owners are unlike any others you will find anywhere! I would highly suggest the Chicken Tortilla Soup love the presentation , the fajitas, the Watermelon Margarita, or the taquitos. The salsa and hot sauce are also not to be missed!",2
Quick service even when they are lined out to the door which happens frequently around noon every day of the week. Food is good and servers aim to please by fixing everything according to order. Only thing I'd change is the drink station. It's located in a corner and it's difficult for more than one person to be there at one time.,2
Super nice and clean! Much larger than TEHARU so no wait. but the portions were smaller than what was expected. The server was very friendly and attentive. I liked how she brought a menu so we could order rolls that weren't on the revolving bar. Overall pretty good though. I would go again if I'm in Gilbert.,2
"I'm going to make this short and sweet. Garlic knots are awesome. Excellent New York style but there is a price. Excellent atmosphere and the waiters waitresses are almost always very good. What keeps this from a 5 star is the parking. This location is becoming crowded, and on a Friday or Saturday night there's a good chance a spot will be hard to find. They need to find a way to expand parking.",2
"I thought Canada was bad with communication companies, but COX in Phx AZ. is the worst , at least in Canada you have three choices and they are more technological advanced, then COX. everything in these previous reviews have also happened to us. no need to repeat the same lousy customer service, reliability issues and tech product offering. nWhy worry about ISIS when you have Cox.",1
"Support this local gem in downtown Gilbert. Simple modern architecture and a unique dining experience. 1st visit was for lunch and there subs are amazing. 2nd trip for breakfast somewhat limited selection, but very tasty. Coffee bar and different deserts made fresh every morning also a reason to visit. Spread the word and check it out. A refreshing change!",2
"I took my friend's son 10 yrs to the gym for the first time. I have been to previous rock gyms long ago, but he had not. The staff was friendly and helpful. The instructor Dave was great. Very patient and explained the procedures well, was very encouraging, and made us both feel comfortable. We really enjoyed the afternoon spent there and would definitely go back again!",2
We had lunch on the boardwalk at Lava because Sushi 101 was closed. Well it was great karma for us because lunch was awesome. I had the club sandwich that was served on focaccia and the bacon on it was superb. And the egg roll appetizer was nice and crispy! Elegant polished bar and open atmosphere. Great for a quiet date.,2
Family owned and local option to get decently priced healthy they screen everything before putting it on the shelves! for your mutts! The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. They have pet perk type rewards so you can get eventually get a bag of food for free or get money off if you're only buying treats or accessories. Oh and did I mention they give free samples?!,2
"Had a great Christmas Eve family dinner at Braddocks. The appetizers were to die for including Braised pork Pierogies this was my favorite , Kielbasa large charcuterie style and stuffed sausage. All were some of the best apps I've ever had to be honest. I had a pretty good filet mignon as we'll but next time I will try something less generic. Great service and atmosphere in the renaissance hotel.",2
I had such a great experience here last night. I came late at night after discovering egg on my car issues of living at a college complex. I was assisted by multiple staff members who were able to completely remove the melted on egg. With their personal help and being allowed to go through twice they were able to save the paint on my car. I won't be getting my car washed anywhere else.,2
"I've stayed here a few times and always had a great experience so it's the place I always recommend to friends visiting Edinburgh. Great location, nice rooms and very friendly staff but my most recent trip has me feeling a bit disappointed. nThe Internet Wifi throughout the hotel has not worked for my stay so won't be staying here again.",1
"I've given McFaddens two chances, both at incredibly slow times and both times, the service was terrible and slow. The first time we were there, I'm pretty sure our server didn't realize she was supposed to be working and it was NOT busy in there. I wish the food was good enough and it outweighed the bad service but it's just typical bar food.",1
"I waited at least 20 minutes for the most flavor free Philly roll ever created. The place was not busy at all. The employees seemed to be rushing.to make one plate at a time. The dine in plates were poorly presented, nothing seemed very fresh, and my take out would have been faster better from Giant Eagle. nDon't waste your lunch break or your money.",1
"Barbara helped us finding a great condo rental in Las Vegas. We just moved from Canada and we didn't know anything about the local market, neighborhoods and the lease conditions. nShe is very professional, understands the needs of her clients and provided me the guidance to find the best option for our family. I strongly recommend her services.",2
Fantastic golf course with amazing facilities and attention to detail! The option to play two of the three 9hole courses to complete our 18holes was nice! Perfectly maintained course with moderate to fast greens and consistent rough outside of the fairway! Every member of the staff here will go out of their way to help any way they can. Great experience!,2
"Not great and not horrible Went for lunch with my wife. Wings were sour and had little meat on the bones. Service was slow. Drinks were empty for extended periods, then refilled with things we didn't order. Sandwiches were sloppy and lacked flavor. Restaurant is marginally clean. Prices are higher than the quality and service by a lot. Was edible, though.",1
Stopped in Saturday for lunch. Sign on main door said to enter through the hooka because of renovations. I did and the place was empty. Waited for about 5 minutes and called out to see if anyone was there. No response. Went to the Delhi Palace buffet up the street. Maybe service will improve after the renovations are complete,1
"They should be able to do so much better with this place than they do. While staying at the Aria, I went there twice and in both cases it took forever to get the food out cold once of the two times even though it wasn't busy. The lack of business should have been a tip off and I shouldn't have gone back after the first lackluster experience. I won't be going back even if I stay at the Aria again.",1
"Went there last Sunday since I was craving for Chinese food. Tried this place out bec the ratings. When I came in,the smell reminds me of Hongkong which is very authentic. We ordered the roasted platter. 15 for small serving! I expected more. I couldve just ordered the rice topping for 7 and get the same amt of meat. Love the roasted pork tho",1
"Do not let the strip mall, small location deter you from visiting this sushi place. We just went with a huge assortment of sashimi with a sprinkling of grilled mackerel and edamame. For being in the Scottsdale area right of the 101, the sashimi was very fresh and we got the insider hookup for wasabi. This place is a keeper.",2
"I can't believe the high ratings this place got. My sis brought home some food from there. Teriyaki chicken was watery sauce and quite too sweet, the chow mein looked strange.very orange and did not taste like chow mein, the salt pepper pork was very spicy and she even asked for mild no spice and the tofu veggie tasted very mediocre. I would rather eat at Panda Express or China Go Go.",1
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I am here at least twice a week. Most dishes are authentic and prices are VERY reasonable. The staff is friendly as well. Recommendations include the crispy chicken, szechuan spicy fish this might not be on the menu , clams in black bean sauce, flounder home style, drunk ginger spare ribs, stir fried pea tips.",2
"Uh, no. Sorry. This place is so unkempt, unruly, and generally disastrous. I've been here twice I gave it a second chance, which was the.uh.Last Chance and no go. The place is dirty, not to mention I wouldn't want to buy any of the shoes I've seen here. Pretty much the same thing with the clothes. Hit up Goodwill instead, or any other thrift shop in PHX. It would be better than this.",1
"Very reasonably priced, comfortable sofas and sectionals. They had a good selection of beds to choose from as well. I was the only person in the store and the 2 salesmen knew I was there, but didn't even say hello or bother to ask if I needed anything. Instead, they felt it was better to talk on their cell phones and sit around. I guess they didn't need my business!",1
WOW! I've been a long time fan of Rita's on the East Coast and was excited when they came to Tempe Tried Joe's Italian Ice today and I have to say I am impressed. I had a Joe Latti with Pi u00f1a Colada ice and vanilla ice cream. The Pi u00f1a Colada flavor was intense. I'm hooked. If you are reading reviews for Joe's I hope you give them a try. You won't be disappointed.,2
"Be aware for negative reviews, these are not regulars and have had one bad experience and then gripe about it. How sad! nI've been here a handful of times and every time it's great. The service is good, the food tastes great, and they are accommodating. The chicken and waffles is delicious . My fav!",2
"Not sure if what they are doing is legal I like the music and the set up a lot, the bar tender decided to charge me 6 for a cup of water, she justified the charge as a ""fill "" and it wasn't that I was only ordering it alone, I ordered two mixed drinks and a beer along with it. Needless to say she did not get a tip.",1
Alan's Air is AWESOME! He just saved me 1400! I had another AC repair company come out and give me a quote of 1600 for parts and labor to fix my AC unit. I called Alan and he fixed it with one part in 30 minutes and the total was only 200! He's a great guy and does great work! I highly recommend this company to everyone!,2
"Best club ive been to in years. Beautiful place, large outdoor area, and it's like a hottybomb exploded in this place, There were gorgeous women all over the place. Just like any hot Vegas club, this place can get quite crowded and too often you find yourself surrounded by people invading your personal space. They also play good music so if you find a spot, dance and drink the night away!",2
"While I was living in Vegas, I went to Kaizen regularly. Very neat clean. Waitering service is good. I've always had their steak since I'm not much a sushi eater. Their steak is sooo delicious. Very tender and tons of flavor. My husband loves all of their rolls. I highly recommend kaizen whether you like sushi or not. There's something on their menu for everyone!",2
Ok so I been here for dinner before and I love the jarred foie gras .I love the frites. I stay at the Venetian many time and I never had the breakfast so I had it on morning with my daughter. I love the waffles here and it was perfect Crispy and fluffy . My daughter loved the salmon and bagles. I will come here from now on for my breakfast.,2
"For the money .Avoid! It's better if you go down the way to Wolfgang puck. It's pretty sad for MGM to be this way. But there is better food at Hometown Buffet. It's really hard to get a refill, the food is kind of rubbery, and the desert is not that great. I recommend going to Luxor or Planet Hollywood. Service could be a little better too.",1
"Fresh, top quality and beautifully presented foods and desserts. Very impressed with couscous and shepherd's pie with cow tongue brisket. Very tasty and ingredients are well integrated! Love their thai tea gelato, coconut macaroon, fruit macaron, and white chocolate mousse! Will definitely return to try more entrees.",2
"I've been here a few times and the food has been wonderful. I've only gotten the deep fried cod with fries, but it's always delicious with tasty tartar and coleslaw on the side. Only thing keeping me from making this a five star review is that it's served a little cold could be hotter from the get go.",2
"What a rip off! I know it's Vegas beaut this place is a total rip off. The service was horrible, slow and rude. We actually left 0 tip. The food was cold and way overpriced for what you got. We ordered eggs bacon, French toast, pancakes and they were all bad. I don't know how a Vegas Cafe can screw up easy breakfast food but they did! Save your money!",1
"One word Ghetto. From what I remember it's dark and dingy. I guess the theme is suppose to be like the tropics or whatever but I felt like I was stuck in 70s palm tree madness. My mom lost her diamond ring here so I may just be biased, but this place is pretty gross. I'd suggest staying somewhere else before you settle for the Tropicrapa. Live, Laugh, and Lunch nPatty",1
"I'm glad we decided to do our Black Friday shopping while we stayed in Las Vegas. The staffs were all very helpful and patient while I requested one after another bag be brought down for my scrutiny. Store isn't too big so it can get crowded, especially when there is a sale event going on. But the place is kept neat and tidy as the employees were constantly moving around putting things back.",2
"The server seemed to think I was just a poor kid who wouldn't tip. So he was rude, took forever to bring my check and didn't even ask why I pushed my plate to the other side of the table with most of my food still on it. The Arizona burrito was a soggy pile of blandness. nOh how tempted I was to prove him right on that tip.",1
"If this place wasn't close to my house and if they didn't have the things my kids wanted needed, I wouldn't go back. nThe employees are hard to locate when you need something, and are never friendly. nThis trip, I walked in and there was no employee in sight. I needed a backpack, which they keep behind the register. I stood there for over 10 minutes before anyone came up.",1
"Very relaxed atmosphere, and the food was good, but our service was soooooo slooooooow! The location is also somewhat off putting and hard to find if you've never been there being as it seems to be literally in the middle of a trailer park. But, once you're inside it's a very chill place, nice to have a hookah and some food.",2
"I will NEVER go back! The food is good, but over priced! nThey charge you for drink refills, they charge you for togo containers. The blinds are broken and nasty, the ceiling fans are nasty. And then they have the nerve to post a sigo plate picking! Give me a freaking break! Make your place upscale , then maybe put a sign up like that!",1
"I went in for a simple clean up on my eyebrows this is what I told him as well my eyebrows ""were "" very full 3 WEEKS OF GROWING now they are totally messed up he took way to much off on both ends of my brows the space between is too wide I WILL NEVER RETURN HERE AGAIN IT WAS MY FIRST ANS DEFINITELY MY LAST",1
"They just opened up over Christmas. Carne Asada Burrito's just OK but the red, green sauce was awesome. Since this was our first time here we tried the puff pasties pumpkin and apple. WOW! light fresh and tasty. It brought back childhood memories of the Hot Apple Pie at Mc Donald's, you know, when they used real apples. Give this place a try. Great group of workers.friendly and neighborly.",2
"first of all i don't appreciate being yelled at ""WERE CLOSE! "" from a female bartender, upon walking into this establishment i waited 5 minutes before someone offered a table and in those quiet 5 minutes i saw at least 3 employees and no one had the decency to say ""someone will be with you shortly "" good food but terrible service. never again.",1
"FANTASTIC neighborhood restaurant! I have been several times and I keep going back and spreading the word. Ingredients are always FRESH, HIGH quality, not OVER salted and the service is Fab! All criterias for 5 stars. Check it out, you won't be dissapointed. FYI, just went back and they now serve alcohol, and heard they are gearing up for dinner.can't WAIT! Thank you Cafe Desert Ridge!",2
"Great casual staff. Fresh crab flown in daily. If you actually know how to navigate authentic smaller East coast blue crab do it. If you are not well versed in painstakingly breaking one of these bad boys down, make sure to get help from the staff. Their side dishes could be a bit more cough cough fresh as in their shellfish, but for a fuight and some tasty interactive dining two thumbs up.",2
I love this store. There are so many inexpensive things to buy. I buy my Tupperware and office supplies here. They also have a great selection of gifts for all ages like Naruto for my nephew and or Sanrio stuff for my niece. The merchandise here is not the best quality because you get what you pay for but it sure is fun to shop here.,2
"Affreux. Deja ils sont tout petits, heureusement d un cot u00e9 parce que pas bon. Les salsas c est nimporte quoi, et le moindre truc est en supplement alors que le prix est deja bien couteux pour ce qu on a u00e0 manger. Personnellement je n ai vraiment pas aimer alors que je suis fan de mexicain. J emmenerai pas mes potes de tijuana ici.",1
"I really have a disdain for franchise pizza. I support local pizzerias as they produce the best product. Pizza Mia pizzas are the best I've had while here in Phoenix. One evening, I ordered takeout and they prepared my order incorrectly. Which wasn't a problem as it was a size smaller then ordered. The owner quickly decided to add another 12 "" to my order! You now have a loyal customer.",2
"I was so excited to find a place to get a coconut italian soda less than a mile from my house. I was blown away when I found out how big the large was and that it was under 3. This place is fantastic. Also check out their menu full of smoothies, espresso drinks, and sandwiches. Water Street needed an independent coffee shop like this.",2
"I had thought that I had already reviewed this great restaurant, but I guess I haven't. I greatly recommend it. I would also like to point out though, as I have sadly come to realize twice in the past couple of months, that the restaurant is closed Not for good I might add it seems due to a family emergency. I'm sure I, or someone else on here, will update when they open back up. I can't wait.",2
"This place is a joke. The food is a joke. The service is a joke. The biggest joke is the security who, in their mind, think they are above all authority. I hear horrible things about this place all the time and I should have never went. I don't understand why there is always a line Friday and Saturday nights. It sucks!",1
bland food meets bad service.and something would not digest so I was reminded of the experience for hours! Had they put as much time and moeny in to the recipes and service instead of the property it woudl have been much better. Nice location but there are much better alternatives! yo qiero tace bell after this one!,1
"I came here once and knew I would never return. It wasn't that the food was bad. They had no hot sauce other than Tabasco. CAn you imagine a Tex Mex restaurant without Cholula or Tapatio? I sent a comment to the company via their website and I never got an answer. With so many Tex Mex choices available, I'll be glad to drive by this place and keep on going!",1
"Dr Amy Sparks is a first rate internist and a wonderful, compassionate person. I have great confidence in her. I think the reviewer below in Lansdale, PA must be writing about a different doctor, since Dr Amy Sparks is in Las Vegas, NOT in PA. Also the description of office procedures doesn't sound right.",2
"It took me a little time to find a place where they buy silver not just gold . I found it here. In a very safe area near Montford. Nice building. Free water. Quick quotes. I think they buy most monetary thing of value. Silver, gold, coins etc. Check em out if you have a ton of scrap silver like I did!",2
"Came to this place solely based on many positive reviews for some good ""Dim Sum. "" Everything we ordered was authentic except the fried egg rolls. It didn't have enough meat in it to make it a traditional egg roll. The only draw back is the location, as it is not located near Chinatown and retail shops area. Otherwise, I give this a thumb's up!",2
Good beers and service. I love the stuffed mushroom appetizer so dee lish. They have a gluten sensitive menu you too. The California chicken sandwich is my so good! Grilled chicken with avocado and green chilies with pepper jack on sour dough. I know it's a chain but this location has a locals feel. Good eats with TV's everywhere. So no one will miss the game.,2
"I'm in heaven. I found this place last time I was in Vegas. It is near the exit that is by the walkway to MGM. The jalapeno pretzel is out of this world. they are large, fat, soft, and warm! The ""everything "" was my second fave. I have to get these pretzels everytime I am here! We went twice this time! They also have yummy caramel or candied apples.",2
We a group of 4 were seated at a booth. They brought our drinks and told us they had a party of 8 that walked in an we needed to move to a small table. How rude is that. They just wanted the 18 gratuity at the cost of loosing customers. They did not ask kindly they just wanted us to move. Unreal to be treated this way. I guess we will never go back.,1
Went for my anniversary. The service was awesome. The appetizers were pretty good as well. I don't even like pretzels but I would recommend theirs. The entrees were good as well. A nice drink selection is available as well. The only thing that I didn't care for was the location downtown parking sucks no knocks on the restaurant. Will definitely go again,2
"great service, reasonable prices, i'm not a big fan of their style of pizza but my husband is.but i'm not typically a big fan of salads, however they have one of three i have ever had that i absolutely love. so both my husband and i love to go there, i can eat healthy and love it and he can have his pie and eat it to ",2
"Great dental office! I was referred here by the owner, and I was not let down. The wait times were nonexistent, the clerks were very helpful and friendly, and the owner, Mark, personally greeted and evaluated me. I would definitely go back and highly recommend this place to anyone needing their teeth done!",2
this dry cleaners does fabulous work. Leslie delivers exactly what she promises. I also appreciate that she is communicative and realistic about the services offered. I was bringing in several dresses that were not exactly easy to clean. but Leslie managed it. Everything was as promised and went as planned. Thanks!,2
"I love this place! Best pizza I've had on the west coast! As a vegetarian, I order the Caprese, Margherita Pizza and Nutella Pizza for dessert. Settebello utilizes high quality ingredients and the prices are affordable. It is never a disappointment when I dine here. I, highly, recommend this place of authentic Italian pizza!",2
"I'm guessing the owner was serving us. He's super motivated and very welcoming. Wanted us to try everything and gave us taste testers haha! I'm so full! Had the Loco Moco and the hamburger seasoning was on point! Might look a little shady from the outside, but the hole in the wall joints usually serve the best food!",2
"walked in the store for some easy no frills food and i got was expensive food that was not terrible but i had better. I had the Dolce vita sandwich that was mostly mustard flavor, bread was really hard but had great flavor. NOt a lot of meat on the sandwches. All 5 of my friends said the same thing.expensive food thats barely mediocre.maybe it was the day, slow day for them.",1
"We went in for breakfast and were pleasantly surprised by the amount of food. We just wanted basic diner breakfast but nothing in site, so were initially thinking it was too fancy. We are big eaters and we left full so, its good. The people were friendly too. There's a big window, so you can people watch.",2
"Please go to the other McDonalds not too far from here at 120 Penn Cir W . One time while using their drive thru service, we realized they forgot to add an item on our receipt. We asked how much the real total is and the employee told me, ""like 5.00. "" WHAT!?!?! CAN YOU PLEASE USE YOUR REGISTER TO TELL ME HOW MUCH THE ACTUAL TOTAL IS!",1
"being a big fan of four peaks I had to give this place another try. The hummus was awfull, definitely out of a tub. Orderd a hamburger and the bun looked like someone sat on it. Beer is good and I like there selections of IPAs. That's about all they got going for them. If they were just a restaurant they would be out of business.",1
"This is always the place to stay in Vegas. The rooms are large and have all the amenities. The penthouse suites are a perfect upgrade for special occasions with nice meeting rooms and a sound system to fill the big square footage. Most of all, unlike other hurried front desks, there is awesome personal customer service, thank you Keoki!",2
Spotless! Service. Dining room. Restrooms. Patio. Spotless! Next time I shall forgo table seating and plop my butt on the floor to eat. Yep. That's how clean Hula's is! Service was polished and friendly. Dana was working the brunch crowd and attending to everyone's needs. Most importantly everyone enjoyed their brunch. I say Bula Bula to Hula's!,2
"Dude, you're so freaking humid. I know that my review won't change anything about this place, but pump some A C into your vents! I swear the both times I came here, in two separate seasons, the level of humidity is too damn high! And I don't understand why the amenities and restaurants are available before going through security. If anything, 1 for free wifi that's actually pretty fast.",1
"We arrived around 6pm and the restaurant was empty. Went to this place because it had good reviews, but I don't think it deserves the review it currently has. If you want authentic Japanese food, this is not the place. I spent more than 50 and I've been to better, cheaper, more authentic Japanese restaurants in Vegas than this.",1
"Great food and wine list. Somewhat overpriced, but it'll be an excellent dining experience. The service was great, and our dinners were fantastic. Overall, the prices are not good, but the chef really knows what they're doing. If you just want the same dishes you can get at any restaurant, this is not the place. If you want an original dish, or something weird, Sage really excels.",2
"Fun concept of revolving sushi as it's more common in Asia . but the sushi tasted skunky. If you've ever smelt a skunk that sprayed its nasty scent around, then you know what I'm talking about! As some others noted, some sushi is warm. Yuck! The prices aren't bad 6 for 22oz Kirin and sake and 2 for plates of 4 pieces of sushi wasn't bad. Surprisingly, I'm not fond of skunk and won't be back.",1
"Inefficient, redundant, overstaffed security process. I travel internationally for business all the time and this is by far routinely the WORST travel experience, and for no particularly good reason. Catching the first am flight out of Montreal, between security and customs, I waited 2 hours. Travelers beware show up 3 hours before your flight for this airport.",1
"We had an absolutely fabulous stay at The Signature by MGM. The room had many upgrades, great views, and a great location. Most of all it was a tremendous value! I couldn't believe how much we got for the price. It was recommended by a friend, we had a great experience, and I definitely plan on staying there again.",2
"Such a great. We unfortunately had to put our beloved dog down and weren't sure where to go. We are very blessed we found this place. They were sweet, comforting and accommodating throughout everything. We even received a card that had hand written condolences after. Good experience through a very hard time.",2
"We went for lunch at the elements restaurant. The food itself was pretty good and about 14 for a sandwich with chips. They seemed very busy and so the service was somewhat hurried and slow, but we were accommodated very well. I am giving this 4 stars because of the amazing view of camelback mountain and the infinity pool. You are paying for the view and the ambiance.",2
"Really friendly service and there are things on the menu for vegetarians, I had the portobello mushroom burger and it was quite tasty. The fries are nothing to write home about but the beer selection is decent. The outdoor seating was a bonus and they allowed my dog to join me which was a really nice touch.",2
This place is the perfect desert place. After a nice dinner date its a perfect place to talk and enjoy frosty delights! There are different variety of desserts from popsicles and ice cream to strawberry water and crepes. Great service and the place is really clean. Our first time there they even gave us mango drink to try for free! Definitely recommend to try this place out ,2
"Out of all the buffets I've been to in Vegas, this definitely takes the crown of the best right here. Sure it costed 30 for a weekend lunch, but I definitely got my 30 worth and whole lot more. I was especially a fan of Pad Thai, the unlimited number of Spicy Tuna hand rolls, and Ribs! So delicious! I'd make every effort to come back here the next time I'm in town. Definitely worth it.",2
I love Macayo's but not this location. Went in the other night and the service was terrible. The food was so so and the whole environment just seemed like we were bothering them by being there. Every staff member we encountered was rude. We sat outside on the patio which is dirty for being a restaurant especially. Happy to go to many of the other locations but won't be returning to this one.,1
"I usually love Arby's but last Saturday, they completely forgot my order. I was told to sit down and wait for my name to be called but as the people who were behind me in line all got their food, my name had still not been called. When I asked about my food, again there was no rush to find my order.and I was already late back to work. Very disappointed in the service but the food was still good!",1
"The good thing their burger is really good! The bad thing their service is laughably bad. Not only was it slow and rude, but he also got my order wrong when it finally came out. I asked for the chicken burger, but got the regular beef burger no big, it was still good and I was hungry . But it was to a level where my group was joking that we must be on a hidden camera show. Won't be going back.",1
"Loved it when they first opened. Stopped coming because it was inconsistent and disappointing. Tried again tonight after several months and won't be back. I ordered the pepper philly combo and there were more peppers than meat. It was too dry to swallow. Cheese was only on a small part of the sandwich. I have never left a yelp review, sorry this has to be my first.",1
"Ahhh fast food! Its all the same! Well here the food isnt super greasy! I love the grilled chicken options they have as well as their breakfast sandwich, but i get it without ham! The price is ok, you pay for what you get right? I also like their curly fries! One weird thing is that they do not give a toy with the kids meals! Left my son hangin! Anway I come here when Im in this area.",2
"Really good. Went several times before reviewing so we could try different things. Dominic is the man. The girls who are servers cashiers are also very friendly. Have tried pizza, pasta, sandwiches and have yet to be disappointed. BOYB here which is fine. A little pricey, but compared to the garbage to pick from in this area it is worth it, for now.",2
" Last night was the ""Last Chopstick "" for us n nI'm well aware that some Folks love ""George's Visits "" to their table. nThe food here is ""Hit or Miss. "" n . and when they Miss . its beyond belief. n Finally my Wife said . NEVER AGAIN. Last nights experience, finally brought her around to agreeing with what . I've been telling her for years. Confucius and Marvin say . Don't waste your Yuan here.",1
"Imagine Denny's with portions twice as large, food quality a little better, and a decor that is totally fun, old school, 80's Las Vegas. Oh, and add pretty servers in short skirts. This place is 5 star fun with 3.5 star food. Definitely a good deal and a great place to sop up the booze with a big, late night breakfast. Don't forget to take a peek at the fireside lounge before you go. It's fun too.",2
"The food was good, but the reason of the low stars was because of the slow service, we ordered food which came timely, but after dinner we wanted to order dessert, but the server paid no attention to us, and we waited for 30 minutes for the dessert menu. Nice food, but not sure if will come again due to service",1
"The salads and sandwiches here are very good, but this review tipped the review from a 3 star to a 4 star when the cashier specifically asked how to spell my name when taking my order. Very cool. I like the variety of lunch options available here, and also a fan of turning any sandwich into a salad. My coworkers and I always go here when travelling to Phoenix on business.",2
This Lenny's location is horrible. The fries appeared to have been sitting in old grease or just old. I asked if they were fresh and she indicated yes. They were horrible. Will never eat at 5713 w. Glendale location again. They are NOT like the other locations. Please mark my words. They don't even deserve 1 star. They didn't even get order correct to begin with. Had to return burger.,1
"4.5 for me. Let me just say that the chicken is absolutely delicious. Juicy, non greasy, and crispy. Biscuits were light and fluffy and the potato wedges were moist and not bricks. YOU GUYS ARE ALL SLEEPING ON THIS PLACE. You need to go and just try the chicken because it is fighting roscoe's chicken for first place. They lost half a star because I did not prefer their Mac and cheese.",2
"One of the best places when it comes to live jazz! They have live jazz 3 times a week and it's ALWAYS good! Their wine menu is also great, the decor is lovely, and the service as well! I gave it 4 stars only because the food is not that great! It's good but I wouldn't go there specifically for the food!",2
"It's In N Out, so yea, it's awesome. This is the location closest to The Strip so it can get very crowded at times. Make sure to order your burgers and fries ""animal style "", it's the only way to go. Gluten free? Order your burger ""protein style "" and it'll come out nicely wrapped in crisp iceberg lettuce. Save room for a shake.",2
"This was our first buffet in our Buffet of Buffets visit, we were impressed. However, it wasn't until well into our first plate that the server came over and took our drink order, and she was less than friendly. The food was all great, I though. My favorite was the steak. I love buffets that have ice cream cones so you can take your treat to go!",2
"Food was good. Beer Cold, Atmosphere fine. Has a dog friendly patio that was nice. Green Chili bean dip was too heavy on the beans and too light on the Chili. If you are going to have some chili dip, give the customer the option to put some heat in it. As it was served, it was not as spicy as my mint toothpaste. Nice place, I would go to again.",2
"Good, solid sushi. Nothing that is really over the top, but what is there is very good. The food comes around on a conveyor belt so it is easy to sit down and just dig right in. Warning though, you can easily over do it. I thought they were going to have to roll me out. Price is great. Two of us going to town still only ran up a 50 tab.",2
"Long line to check in all Friday night 1 hour wait to get room keys. The whole floor smelled like a sewer. ""Renovated "" rooms? No towel rack, exhaust van, or soap dishes in the bathroom. Also no AC vent so the bathroom was like a sauna. Plugged in my cellphone charger and the loose outlet sparked. Looks like the trailer park manager did their to model!",1
"They are famous for their bread and cakes. I went on a Sunday and had a delcious brunch for an amazing low price of u00a310, this included tea coffee, juice and plenty of food. Attentive staff and relaxed atmosphere. I caever resist coming here when in Edinburgh and always end up buying something to take back to London.",2
"I went only because the group I was with wanted to go, the only good thing about this place was that I got in free. The music was just eeh nothing big, I'm in my mid 20's and there was at this saloon was mid 40 ladies and a lot I older guys not my type of crowd. If your in 40's and want free shots of juice had absolutely no alcohol in it then this is the place to be.",1
"We got to Mix a bit late and when we tried to get in the lady at the door said it was last call. So we said ok, we'll get a drink and leave. She said no, and that it had already been called. We politely asked if we could just go up and check out the view as we had heard so much about it. Then she just stood up and yelled, ""I said no! We are closed and you are not getting in. """,1
"WOW! This place is amazing! Last night was my first time and I was very impressed. The decor is beautiful, sets a great atmosphere. The food was very good. We started with the mexican street corn, the flavors were great. I highly recommend the mussels and the mexican pho! I will definitely be dining at sumo maya again!",2
This has got to be my favorite club in Vegas so far. I have been here twice and I absolutely love it. The decor is fun and trendy. The layout is awesome. The different dance rooms for different djs and music lets me have options to wonder around. I meet a lot of friendly party people here too! Perfect place to get wild! P,2
"Beautiful spot to watch the sunset over the strip. I haven't tried this place for late night, but at sunset it isn't too packed and you can relax and enjoy the view. From other reviews don't order food. but why the heck are you ordering food at a club type place anyways? Seems obvious to me. Drinks are pricey, but views like this don't come cheap.",2
"This review is for the casino. The new expansion is pretty nice. The Hard Rock is definitely one the epicenters of ""hip "" in Vegas, but has always managed to get by with one of the smallest, if not the smallest, casino floor out of all of the high profile properties in town. With the new expansion, the gaming floor is much larger and more on par with other casinos of its size.",2
"I was there for lunch a couple weeks ago and got the chicken lunch special. My mother got the same thing along with a spicy tuna roll. The chicken was undercooked and pink. I didn't notice because of the sauce and luckily I didn't get sick. The spicy tuna roll was good though, and the service was ok. You can't beat the prices.",1
Friendly staff but I think the manager needs to firm up organization. nA couple waitstaff seemed to be just not really engaged in what they were doing. n40 min wait for food nKids grilled cheese was cold nOther kids meal was just ok. nFish tacos decent I'll give them another shot but maybe just for a beer. Too bad cuz location is great and lots of TVs.,1
"I used to go to the location on EVB been going to Honey Bear's since the early 90's.Love Honey Bears it's great they are in Central PHX closer to me now I see they have Greens on the menu but, they were out yesterday .Will be back for the Fried Chicken on Wednesdays some Greens.Also, wish they had Fried Green Tomatoes.",2
"Other than ""T "" Employee and Orian Employee the rest of the staff are rude and terrible workers. They pack bowls of hookah and ignore customers the rest of the night. I recommend they either fire or retrain the rest of the workers. This hookah lounge also doesn't accept the second amendment and nor do they allow outside beverages. My review of the lounge has changed since this experience.",1
"My best friend and I just spent this past weekend at The Cosmopolitan for the first time. We had the 1200 Square foot wrap around terrace suite and it was beyond beautiful. We by far had the best view of the strip, especially at night. The hotel is BEAUTIFUL, the casino was immaculate! It's very pricey but so worth it if you can afford it. We had an unforgettable time.",2
"This place is definitely not worth it. Compared to the other restaurants in the Golden Nugget, this one lays goose egg and not a golden one. I almost never recommend other places, but the Cafe in Binion's across the street is way better than this place. It is open 24 7 and even though it is usually very busy they are really good at moving people through there.",1
Scottsdale has to be the best vacation spot in America. Where else is happy hour in a MALL? Want a discount on your Sushi at Zen 32? Bring a card carrying model and get 25 off. I want to be here more that just a weekend during Giants Spring Training. http sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com spring training tickets.jsp?c id sf,2
"I got excellent service from Valley Respiratory Services. They two different technicians did great work for me when I needed it. VRS are trusted by my doctor, who is excellent. I will continue getting my supplies here. Bad reviews are a way to punish a business and should not be done lightly. Then we lose neighborhood services that we need and are excellent.",2
"I agree with the previous reviews and wish I listened. We had a horrible experience tonight. I was with my friend and her mom and the service was horrible. Many mistakes made and the owner refused to take responsibility and make good. Instead the manager or owner treated us horrible, raised his voice, and was beyond disrespectful. Avoid at all costs.I mean.still in shock!",1
"Hands down the best sushi in the valley. Don't let the modest decor fool you. You always get the freshest fish, best rolls, and perfect portions. There are always great specials to try too. I could eat here everyday. This is just one of those places where they get it right. No gimmicks. If you want great sushi this place is for you.",2
"Let me say this, after be willing to try to place one more time, I will NEVER, EVER , EVER Go back to this place ever again. 2nd Time around was not a charm . This place does not tell you the real deal and you are left wondering WTF? Bottom line SmashBurger SUCKS THE BIG ONE. Food is not up to par and staff sucks.",1
"This place is awesome! My girlfriend doesn't like burgers but if its Chuck box, she craves it! The burgers and fries are good, but a MUST try are the jalape u00f1o poppers! These things are freaking delish to the point I have to get one for me and one for the girlfriend. When we go to AZ this is 1 of 3 spots we must make time to eat at!",2
"I've been here for brunch and lunch and have enjoyed each visit. Last time I was there for lunch we each got a flight of beer. Our server was great and helped us each pick our flight. The food was delicious, lobster mac and cheese as well as the fish tacos and tots were both phenomenal. Great brewery, I will be back again.",2
"Went in thinking we'd be waiting for a while at 11am on a Saturday but we were immediately seated. 6 mimosa was generous in a wine glass, apple pancakes were ridiculously good like best ever good , hashbrowns weren't greasy.just overall great classic brunch. The owner was walking around talking to people and the whole vibe was really easy and relaxed. Will be going here often.",2
"I absolutely LOVE this place. I am going to miss living right down the street. Great Happy Hour mussels oh MY . Great Bartenders and the food is beyond Compare. They stir instead of shaking the martinis AND have my favorite vodka, Tito's. Gayle is just a delight every time I go in. I've also made a few friends hanging out there. OH and the ambiance! Get there. Now.",2
"There are 81 reviews on here. I don't think I can say anything that will be different than anyone else. nI love this place, and it made my entire visit to Pittsburgh worth it. I recommend it like crazy. nAnd, as a last point, I thought the mussels and the cheese board were the best damn thing I've ever had.",2
"Phenomenal live music, cheap beer, great bartenders and a good crowd make for a hell of a destination. Visited this place the first time when I was living in Washington, DC, and the feel of the crowd at the Moose blew the hell out of anything I was seeing in DC. Whereas a lot of Pittsburgh's gone nonsmoking, this place is still a smoking establishment, for better and worse.",2
The food is good but the service is terrible. I have an autoimmune disorder that prevents me from eating gluten and they lied and told me it did not contain gluten when it did. When I called and asked for a refund since I could not eat it the manager proceeded to scream at me for twenty minutes about how it was my fault and refused to refund or substitute for me. I will NEVER eat here again.,1
"If you like food that tastes like grease , you'll likeThe Yard! nMy sandwich was fried green tomatoes, bacon cheese. The bacon was not cooked the tomatoes were laden with grease. The tomato soup was ugh! My friend had a steak sandwich cheese. She said it was awful and left it and the soup. It's the worst restaurant in Shadyside. Fast food is better than this food!",1
"This is a wonderful place to go to do all kinds of shopping. With stores like Gap, Sephora, M.A.C, H M, who can go wrong? Window shopping is fun too for the places I only WISH to shop at someday! lol! With all that walking you might need a snack as well. The Planet Hollywood restaurant was very meh, however Max Brenner makes up for it! Chocolate Pizza! Yay!",2
"This place is great. The AYCE sushi is very fresh and they do not put tons of rice with it, so you are not just filling up on rice. They are also extremely attentive, always asking if you would like to order more. Some AYCE take their time to ask you for more orders so you can digest longer and get full without eating as much. Definitely will be coming back.",2
"We spent the last few days in Vegas and decided to stop in here for pancakes. First thing, they didn't have the holiday pancakes because they forgot to order the stuff for them. the place was a mess, but the staff was nice. What we did have to eat was not bad, but compared to other locations, I was disappointed.",1
"I found Lindsay on a Groupon and still continue to go to her after the special was over. Her prices are great and she's flexible with her schedule and tries to accommodate your schedule. Her area is clean and relaxing. She makes the somewhat embarrassing ""bare all "" very relaxing. You'll be happy you went!",2
"DISGUSTING FOOD with expensive price. The slice of beef for Pho is supposed to be thin and tasty, instead it's CHEWY and thick and very smelly. My bowl of Pho was so nasty that I could not barely have the 3rd bite and left the whole bowl untouched. I'd not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Pricy and yucky food!",1
"There's no excuse for fake bacon bits on a salad, soggy un toasted white bread for a smoked meat sandwich, or dry overdone chicken fingers. This food was simply bad. If you're waiting for a flight, go for a pre made sandwich for a fraction of the price at one of the cafes. For our experience, Moe's was expensive and extremely disappointing.",1
"Not at the top of my list anymore! Ordered the royal burger, when the burger came the egg was still runny in spots. A server came by and told me that that is how they cook them now. It will be a long time before i go back to any red robin. never saw a manager, never got refills on the drinks, had to ask for everything we wanted, ex. extra napkins. POOR SERVICE. POOR FOOD.",1
"This place is wonderful. Not only did they accommodate my post breakfast, breakfast order, but they did it with genuine friendliness. Every person I encountered here was pleasant and friendly. The store is clean, there's a large variety of options and the food is great. I hope they will open locations in the other airports I frequent!",2
I got a groupon deal. I attended for a month. I am not yoga master however I didn't enjoy the classes. The instructor has this monotone voice that is not clear but she was nice in a dry kind of way if that makes sense. I went three days a week for that month and she did the same poses in the same sequence every session. It was so boring. Like snooze fest.,1
"Overpriced and nothing special. They attempt to have gourmet pizza by having gourmet toppings, but when the crust, sauce and cheese all taste like little ceasars it just doesn't work. Wine list is fairly bad and way over priced. There are so many good gourmet pizza places in phoenix, don't waste your time at this one!",1
Purchased a LocalDine and was anxious to try the place. Went on Fri 5 24 13 to find out that their contract expired on 5 20 so they would not honor my July expiration coupon. Food was very mediocre and not impressed with any of our three choices. One slice of turkey in a 9 sandwich! Yikes. We will not return.,1
"A great hidden gem! My husband and I were needing a sushi fix and the reviews were good for this place.The waitstaff was very attentive and recorded several types of sushi.It is a small place.not over the top Vegas ,nice mom and pop place. I recomend the spider roll and the sushi roll combo. Great prices. I hope we can make it here before we leave",2
"Prices are reasonable, the wine is great, and the servers always have an on point recommendation. They also have a great deal on Tuesdays called Board and Bottle night. It's tough to get a table, but that does more to confirm my high rating of the place than conflict with it. It's a great place for a happy hour or a friendly brunch, or whatever. It's just a good place to spend time ",2
Tacos are fantastic but you may have to wait up to an hour! This place is right on my way home from work and I often stop here to get food to take home. The price is right but sometimes the wait is verrrryyyy long. The people who work there are always super friendly and it doesn't get more authentic than this. I would try to go there when it's not too busy but the asada and abodaba are FANTASTIC!,2
It'd be nice if these cheap bastards would provide WiFi. Is it really that taxing upon you? How hard is it to set a guest network that doesn't kick you off after 2 hours while you spend 80 100 with your girl here? Add .05 to your beer price and make up for it if its hurting you that bad. Go to Hazelwoods across the street instead.,1
"Pretty bad customer service, I don't think anyone over the age of 16 works here. Place always seems busy which is good for them but makes it impossible to get any help. I needed help getting an item off the shelf and into my car and was told someone would help me. Nobody ever came so I had to do it myself. Lucky for me some nice person in the parking lot saw me struggling and helped.",1
"Rick the Pool Dude is the main dude I would trust with my pool. I've had some issues with previous companies and Rick is the most knowledgable of the business. From a minor leak I had to maintaining my pool, Rick does a great job. He is prompt and gets the job done how it should be. I wouldn't call anyone else but Rick the Pool Dude.",2
"Chris was great. I have used Urais landscaping before, but Chris was so much better. He gave me a greate quote to clean my front and back yards and he worked his ass off. I have since set up to have him maintain my yard on a monthy timeframe and have not be disappointed. He does such an awesome job. I am really happy to have found him.",2
I don't think this doctor even deserves a rating as high as 1. He is a typical pill pusher. I went to him for severe back pain which I have been seeing a chiropractor for for some time. He did not listen to my complaints but just prescribed pain meds which is what I have been trying to avoid. And he has the mist horrible bedside nanner. Worse experience ever!,1
"Went on a Saturdays night and had a blast. Music was a nice variety. Had two tables right in front of dj booth, it was awesome. Lots of good surfaces to dance on. Big Don't remember seeing a bottle service girl after the booze was dropped off but security was very attentive. Had a good time, they just need to stay open later.",2
"Will never go back to chronic taco, they gave me a serious case of food poisoning. Threw up all night the worst case I've ever had. Dunno what they did but maybe they have contaminated meat. Had the shredded pork taco and threw every bit of it up. Was just fine before i ate there. Wanna warn others if you choose to eat there to be careful.",1
I had to stop here upon recommendation from my coworkers. Being from Chicago it was nice to be able to sit down and feel the nice warm air come in from outside. I had the Waffle with fresh blueberries and a blueberry compote on top. The meal was great but a little pricey. For the waffle and a small glass of OJ it was over 16 dollars for breakfast.,2
"Locate in Paris Casino is a casual quick eats type of cafe. Filled with Pastries, Baked Goods, Hot Cold Sandwiches,Pizza whole or by the slice, soup and salads.They take out window for pizza which is great for a the fast bite. I stopped in for a breakfast pastry and coffee, prices reasonable and relaxing atmosphere. No waiter service and seating available inside and out.",2
"These guys are great, extremely professional, thorough, and reliable. Most importantly, they got the job done. It was the best carpet cleaning I have ever had. My sofa looked brand new and they even got make up out of my carpet! nI would highly recommend them. I like how they are the owners and they come out to do the job themselves.",2
"freaking huge portions. the sandwiches are super yummy. the french toast, covered in bananas, and that crumbly sugary delicouisness is to die for.and you might unless you jog 10 miles afterwards. but the real treat is the desert counter.oh my god, even to just look at it is an honor. good bang for the buck.",2
"I always love outback, a good tip is if you order a lobster tail you can have them season it with the same seasonings that they use on the steaks, eg outback special seasoning. The food is pretty consistent at outback and if there is ever a problem they will take care of you. This outback was clean and the staff were very friendly. Will be back again!",2
"I'm not a fan. I always leave disappointed. I'm a draft beer drinker. They have a good selection, but everyone seems to at this point. My problem is the food. It is just eh. They have the wood fired oven, which is nice. I guess I don't understand the large crowds. The food is good, but not that good. I guess I prefer Hemingway's for standard bar food or The Porch for upscale bar food.",1
"Great place and great service. Best auto service I have ever encountered. Pricing was fair, and everything was clearly explained to me. Chuck offered me an on the spot discount, and even gave me a ride to my house and back to the shop because of the long wait. I couldn't imagine any other company doing that for their customers. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for auto care.",2
What a great experience I had last week at this salon! Michelle Morency was FANTASTIC ! Michelle colored my hair and gave me a full head of extensions. My color is great and my extensions look so natural. I was impressed with her knowledge of the product and the experience she has with doing hair. I would recommend her to anyone who wants a great color and fantastic extensions.,2
"Went to eat there for ""Brazilian Wednesday "" and I was very disappointed. The only thing Brazilian was this gigantic piece of meat which did not look very appetizing. The ambience of the buffet is that of a hospital cafeteria, very depressing. The service was very good, but for 45 for 2 people you're much better going somewhere else.",1
"Went to aliante Station casino for the first time tonight to cash my calif unemployment check. They would not cash it. Karen the cashier explained that they do not cash california unemployment checks. By the way I have all necessary id my station casinos ""preferred "" card. Also I have been cashing my unemployment checks at red rock casino without a problem. Go figure.",1
"Today is July 18,2014, my wife and I went to Lenny's thinking it would be good as usual. We were wrong. My double burger was something that was pre cooked and dried out. Had never had such a horrible experience here before. Wondered how our food got to so quick, now I know. Wife was not happy with her hot dogs either. After going there many times before, will never go there again.",1
"Even though we were the only customers there, we had to wait an hour for our mediocre pizza. nAt one point while we waited, another customer apparently a regular customer came in with his dog. We watched as the dog walked through the kitchen area. Yuck. If we hadn't been starving, we would have left immediately.",1
"The ham and cheese croissant sandwich was a great on the go breakfast. Despite the line crowd, everyone was pleasant and orderly, and made crepes, coffees, and sandwiches with efficiency and ease. It's nice to know that my croissant sandwich was made fresh instead of just extracted from the display case and heated up. Definitely recommended for a quick pick me up.",2
"This review is for the downstairs area. The portions are large, prices are okay, and their service is bad. I know for a long time they didn't accept debit cards which can cause issues! Must say though, the carrot cake here could be the best I've ever had. The bakery side just needs to be a bit more well attended, as sometimes I've found myself waiting there for a while, trying to flag down people!",1
This smoke shop is a rip off place! Bought a G5 pen but was given the wrong defective one. Did not want to give a refund and insist no return on any purchase on the store even though there no sign about the policy. nThe owner took the product and just told me to dispute the charge on my credit card. Total jerk and asshole!,1
"We had a group of 5 in Vegas for a bachelor party and visited Sun Buggy. Booking was easy, pickup was on time and they even made a stop for me on the way , staff was courteous and quite patient I was still shaking off the night before . Our guide was awesome and the ride was one of the most fun things I have done in a long time. 5 stars all around. Thanks guys!",2
"The brunch at the Great Dane is quite impressive and it also took my by surprise. I've always been pleased with the dinner menu, and the view of the downtown Capital is extraordinary. But, I tried the brunch for the first time today and the waffles were to die for. Melted in my mouth. I also had a bite of my aunts huevos rancheros which were delightful.",2
"I like this PetSmart location. It's always full of people and seems to do well in business. So it can't be that bad, right? The new ish Pets Hotel is a plus. I don't use it because it's really pricey, but I like having the option to. The animals here seem to be doing just dandy, and with open arms they allow me to bring in my large Golden Retriever, Lilly. I don't have any qualms with this place.",2
"excellent as always. A great dining experience if you like meat. five stars for consistency. I have had the same dining experience in Sao Paolo, Brazil, Minneapolis, MN, Atlanta, GA and Las Vegas, NV. nUsually, I would consider this boring and typical of chain restaurants like Chilli's, but when the experience is so AWESOME, you want it to be repeated and they deliver!",2
The decor was really nice and the music was amazing. But I have to say the bouncers there are terrible. A friend in my group got kicked out for swaying a little to sit down to text someone he couldn't find in our group. After that 5 bouncers swarmed him and he was sent down the stairs into a taxi. He wasn't harassing or causing a scene. It's a vegas nightclub!,1
"Likely the best club sandwich I've ever had real roasted turkey, balanced well with crispy bacon and lightly toasted bread. The restaurant is small, so a line at the door is normal, but the turn around at the tables is quick, so you can expect to be seated relatively quickly. Service is very good fast as amiable.",2
"20,000 watts of awesome. nNote This review only applies to August 2006 May 2007. Whatever may have transpired at this establishment before or after that time has not been taken into consideration. This time period is considered by the majority of scholars to be the Golden Era of Kams. This review also applies to the lesser known Koms ",2
"For 28 person you should expect much more. The food is below average, the buffet selection is geared towards Asian folks I would say, but the quality is just not there. It's all about mass production of food. I can see why since it is at an extremely busy hotel but I would expect more for the price. The staff is friendly.",1
Visited on 4.10.14 nStopped by around 10 and their was a live band playing on the first floor. My group and I went up to the 3rd floor and ordered a round of cocktails. I love that they serve Veuve by the glass here! It was kind of busy but luckily we found a couch to sit at and take in all that the chandelier has to offer. It is stunning inside this lounge. A must see while in vegas!,2
"Okay, I hate Walgreen's because of their stance on dispensing drugs if the pharmacist has some religious objection to your birth control, he can refuse to dispense it. That's CRAP . But, they're the only ones that carry the one brand of hosiery that doesn't make me stabby. So, fine. I have to go here every other week.",1
"Wonderfully fresh and delicious Greek food. Really enjoyed the gyro and the hand cut Greek fries, but I think I'm most excited about having fresh dolmades only 5 minutes from our house! The interior of the restaurant is clean and pretty, with murals of Greece on the walls and Greek music playing. Service is good.what a great addition to Indian Trail!",2
"Their bubble tea is very mediocre, however the food was nicely prepared. I had the Salt Pepper Pork and it was a little bit over fried, was difficult to chew. What I didn't appreciate is that my spoon was not properly washed. It had pieces of dried eggs on it. They did gave me a new one but come on, wash your utensils properly. Good food, but was disappointed in the hygiene.",1
"Yeesh. The server was friendly and the place was open at 10pm. But it looks tired and dirty. From overuse not neglect. You have families with babies who drop fries all over the floor, spilled drinks, you name it. As for the food.must you ask? It's all the same, Chili's, TGIF, Applebee's, they get all their stuff from the same supplier. If you're a tourist, it's edible.",1
"Ridiculous! Placed an order for delivery and I get a call back almost an hour later saying they're too busy to make my food so they just won't. Another time, went to try the burgers, they're good, but the service is horrible. Just a tip You won't get to keep your customers if you treat them like crap.",1
"I will never return to this bar. was treated extremely rude by the bartender Big fat white guy , My boyfriend and I tried to order drinks on several occasions, he totally ignored us and wouldn't walk past us. We would then see him peering at us from the other side of the bar. we ended up walking out.its a shame because it's at a great location for us.",1
"Walked in, walked out. Never have I been to a restaurant of this caliber that had such an overwhelming odor of fish salmon, I believe. Neither my wife nor I like salmon, so we cancelled our reservation. I knew Dresslers had quite a few seafood items on the menu, but was not expecting the overwhelming smell. ",1
"If you come with a group, I recommend a punch bowl. Lots of fun and bound to get you drunk. I've been here a million times and it always delivers. Every drink I've ever had has been delicious. The music is great and the bartenders are fantastic. I just wish they had a little parking lot right in the front.",2
"No, cake cannot replace sex, but it definitely tastes good. I've tried both the carrot and chocolate cake, and will order the latter whenever I have a chance. I also have had the quiche of the day very tasty and their raspberry dressing is pretty yummy. It's not a large place and can fill up fast. They are looking to franchise if anyone is interested.",2
Granted we received the gift certificate from a golf tourney but the heat was terrible! We have been here almost two hours and the room us no cooler and maintenance says there's nothing they can do! I'm fairly certain that they ONLY give this room to people who they give the certificates to! I love the heat but this is ridiculous.so I'm not important enough to you?!,1
"The pictures here Yelp don't show the newer Shea location in Scottsdale. Looks like central Phoenix to me. Dined here last night while watching the Spurs wreck the Suns Chicken wings are great, the hoagies are amazing, prices are very reasonable, the service is decent. A great casual place to chow and watch a game.",2
"We always loving coming here to have coctails. We could usually get a seat, and the lounge is positioned well for people watching. The bar offerings are expansive, and you can't go wrong with anything they specialize in. I have yet to be disappointed in choosing this venue as a perch for the evening.",2
"You get free prawn crackers if you order over a certain amount. Not the best I've tasted, I don't find it salty enough. I used Justeat to have Happiness delivered to my doorstep. The delivery was supposed to take 45 minutes but it was 30 minutes late. It's acceptable chinese food. I do like that they have vegetarian options for my friends. It's affordable and I quite enjoyed the springrolls.",1
"Never sign a contract with these rip off artist! They put in the fine print on the back of the 6 month or 1 year contract that the monthly facial charge will then go month to month and they keep charging your card until you write or come by and sign a form to discontinue. What a load of crap. Rachel, the manager, was of no help whatsoever.",1
"Just visited this place and left very disappointed. The service is slow, and this place is too loud and pricey. I ordered some Mongolian style bbq, they brought me a bowl of rice and a plate full of onions and 6 8 small pieces of meat, and it costed 19. Plus I ordered a cup of shrimp soup that didn't have any shrimps and costed another 5.",1
"The food we had was very tasty and reasonably priced. We had in house specially cocktails that were delicious! I did try the mol u00e8 and I've had much better but everyone has different opinions on mol u00e8, my wife liked it. We enjoy the food at the Clarendon downtown and I was glad to hear that this is owned by the same people! Definitely worth trying",2
The ice cream is delicious and the atmosphere is one of a kind. It's not amazing food but you don't really go there just to get a stellar meal. I loved this place as a kid and I love it as an adult too. My girlfriends and I have a tradition that anytime one of us has a breakup we go here and split a big ice cream treat. It always makes things better ,2
I used to really enjoy Mimi's but then they changed the menu. No more Albacore and Avacado sandwich. Had the streak salad instead and it was a disaster. Who puts deep fried cheese balls on a salad? They do now. Service was also one step behind Denny's. Another restraunt who switched from good food to cheap food and kept the prices high.,1
"Ohana offers chinese food thats pretty decent for a hawaiian place they still do your typical mix plates and katsus but if you want to mix some chinese food in the mix which i do everytime, then go here. i usually order a bbq mix plate and i either order some chow fun or pan fried crispy noodle chow mein.",2
I've been a zipcar member for a year and use it whenever I need a car bigger then what I have to carry larger items. I like that cars are almost always available where I live. The cars are definitely used hard and often have a lot of scratches but they're city cars and not mine. Zipcar is easy to use and the prices are very fair for what you get.,2
"Used them for about a year and had problem after problem! The worst part was today when I made a complaint about the work that had been done, the lady drilled me about what kind of sticky was on my floor and what color it was? Really! Very unprofessional ! Not to mention she called me back to argue about what was broke in my house! Would not recommend them to anyone!",1
"Uh maze ing! We came for lunch and ordered the Red Velvet Whoopie Pie yes, dessert first , the Corned Beef Pastrami on Rye for the hubby , and the Eggplant Grilled Cheese. Delicious! We will definitely be back! Especially since it's near Anthem where we live. I think this is my new favorite restaurant! Next time we will try the Egg Pizza I've heard so much about, and the Red Velvet bagel.",2
"This is the my favorite Costco. It's less than 8 miles from my house and the staff are so nice. Most important, the fruits are fresh. Not all store are dealing with customer the same way. I find that customers shop at this location are more polite than other location. The parking lot are a lot of bigger than other location.",2
"What a dump. Carpets are dirty, threadworn, and buckled. Water stains on the ceilings. Not nearly enough signs to find tour way around. The place is obviously under renovation, but in the meantime, unless you're really strapped for cash, just say ""No! "" to the Quad. I was afraid to try any of the food choices here based on how rundown the hotel was.",1
Me and my girlfriend went there yesterday we had fish and chips food was excellent the service was good but the problem was when I check my bank statement they charge more than what the slip was I did call back the restaurant give my name to the girl and waited for the manager to call me no response yet.,1
We are sushi lovers. And we are definitely not fans of the sushi place. Doesn't seem like they put any heart into their food it just seems likeThe same thing is you would get anywhere. If that is what you're looking for in this place will be fine. But we always like to find unique places that serve unique food that parties in your mouth.,1
The most ridiculous excuse for a station for any kind of public transportation Ive ever seen. I cant possibly write a review that would be bad enough to talk about this place and how crappy it really is. All the negative words you could use to describe a location.you could use about this place.and the company Greyhound.that serves it.,1
"If you're a smoker, this is your hotel. EVERYTHING reeked of smoke. The plumbing was lousy in my room, but I will say the room was fairly quiet and had some fun decor. It seemed everything about this hotel was mediocre from the gambling to the food. I was in town for a conference so I didn't have to pay my way. If I were visiting Vegas for fun, I'd stay somewhere else!",1
"Well worth the trip off the Strip. Fun, inventive Japanese cuisine. The Omakase is the best option for first timers. For the 3 of us, we ordered the omakase and threw in a couple extra things the menu is quite extensive . For me, the cold plates really stood out sashimi paired with fresh fruits, vegetables, and sauces. Will definitely check it out again!",2
"Was surprised to see no line for Sunday brunch. Should have known why.food is very underwhelming for the price point. Food was bland, cold, lack of selection, and overall did not taste good. I expected more esp. It being inside the cosmopolitan! Cesar's and M buffet are the places to go when in Vegas. A little pricer but food significantly better. You've been warned!",1
"Always check your to go order, a rule should have remembered as I found that Haweli does not include steamed rice with its vegetable dishes. When I called to ask if it was typical everything is a la carte. Karaikudui which is just down the road from Haweli does include steamed rice and the cost is the same and as good if not better. And no unpleasant surprises when I open the to go bag.",1
"I absolutely love this place, not only because they do an amazing job but because of the customer service. I so appreciate his sarcasm and offering me hot cross buns. Such and old school feel. I drive from downtown to take my clothes here because, as he tells me, ""You know I'll take care of you, dear. """,2
I went because I live in Oakland and I wanted decent Italian pasta. The meal which I ordered was fettuccine with housemade meat sauce and I wasn't impressed enough to pay 18 for it. Definitely over priced.The service was quick I was in and out io time but the service wasn't that great. I don't plan on going again.,1
"I'll just preface this by saying this is not a place for health nuts. That's really what I couldn't get past while here. Sure, all burger joints are gonna be pretty artery clogging, but Burgatory especially. My burger tasted great I ordered some custom concoction , and so did the fries, but both were underscored with the nagging thought, ""How many years of my life is this shaving off? """,2
Had to order the Marsala again my cravings were keeping me up nights! and it was just as brilliant as the time before in fact I want some NOW! Also tried the tiramisu it was great usually I'm not a huge fan but I'm still shocked pleasantly surprised at how top of the line what a class act Maru's turned out to be! nWay to go Maru's! Keep up the great work!,2
"The ONLY place in Madison where you can get a good fresh donut. Try the Old Fashioned's , as they are the best in my opinion. Remember to get there early on the weekends for optimal selection,but they also make the donuts at night as well, so sometimes 6 30 7 00pm on weekdays works well. Nothing beats a hot donut from the Greenbush.",2
I have no idea how this place got 4 stars. The fresh rolls were made with wilted lettuce. We got the vermicelli combo and the chicken combo. Meat was fatty and they did not use vermicelli. Gross fat rice noodles that turned to mush. The service was awful as well. Bad bad bad all around. Deeply disappointing.,1
"This is the 4th time I've come here, and the food has always been great. the salads as well as the entrees are all delicious, even the kale salad! The salt caramel custard is to die for, so save room for dessert. I gave the place 4 stars only because its SO loud in there, you cant hear the people sitting across the table from you. Will definitely b going back.",2
"This is our favorite place to go. They have Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner that are all unique and great tasting. Keep a look out behind counter for the chalkboard full of great drink options and additional treats. Coffee, Milkshakes, Smoothies and much more. Park Cafe's service is great starting with Gilbert and other workers. We enjoy our time there and think everyone should try it.",2
"5 stars for their egg custard filled mochi pancake shaped ""buns "" they also come filled with bean paste . They're 1, warm, and delicious, and had us making special stops just to buy them. Minus one star only because the place was so small and I wished they had a few tables to sit at inside and enjoy my bun. In the winter, munching away outside is a cold endeavor.",2
"Kind of Bait and switch. On the phone I got the following offer Buy 3 tires get 1 free. nActually it was buy 3 tires get 1 free but you have to buy an additional tire warranty 80 and get alignment done, so it cost extra 170. not cool. I don't do business this way. I don't think I will ever do business with this company.",1
"This is my local branch and I have had nothing but good service whenever needed. The staff seem to be happy and there is not too much turnover, the ATM is in the lobby and it can accept a cash deposit in several denominations. Parking is great and it is just a couple doors from Starbucks which is my favorite morning destination.",2
"U must go at least 2 times to really appreciate this outstanding pizza and add ricotta cheese as one of the toppings.I LOVE THIS FRIGGIN PIZZA, NY style cheesecake and the lady godiva chocolate cheesecake was unbelievable. I could eat this pizza 7 days a week, 24 hrs a day. Trust me, one time is not enough to really appreciate.",2
"I love Panara, I hear some bad things about management but I don't believe the rumors. Anyway, Pittsburgh is sorely missing good bagel places and Panara comes through not only with bagels, but other great, fresh bakery items. Good soups and sandwiches, being vegan I love their offerings. Good coffee too, they have a french roast that puts Starbucks to shame.",2
"This location has the worst customer service. I have tolerated the unwelcoming, entitled attitudes of both staff and customers alike because, in general, I like Whole Foods. After being charged double on a bottle deposit and having the customer service counter dismiss my request for assistance, I will shop here no longer. Treat your customers like garbage and they will leave.",1
"I absolutely love v this place! Yesterday was my first time here, Liana cut and blew dry my hair. She took the time to tell me what would be better for hair since I have tons and thick hair! She explained everything she would do and put to my hair. Yes it is a Lil more expensivethan others, but you get what you pay for. No regrets.",2
"Looking for your standard Pho and Vietnamese fair? This place does it just right. I spoke with the owner and length and he was very proud of the freshness of ingredients they use, and that everything is done on sight, they are not using premade ingredients. The effort shows in the food that is served excellent!",2
"Had to leave Grimaldi's because they had ""to change their coals "" could only offer salads appetizers. The wait for pizza would have been over an hour. Oh well sorry Grimaldi's you lost customers today next time I won't think of you because if I'm hungry for pizza, you're ovens might not be working because you're ""changing your coals "". This is a pizza place, right?",1
For my money the best of the 3 or 4 Asian buffets in this stretch of Indian School. Recently remodeled. Plenty of choices. Most of the trays were the proper temperature. I've been twice now and it was busy during the opening weeks but not so much the second trip which led to a few trays aging before getting empty. I hope it develops the following in the neighborhood it deserves.,2
"I will not come back again. Poor service especially the manager. One of their staff promised me to change to 2 queen bed room on Sat. When I talk to them, they just transfer to manager. The manager was having a poor attitude. He even said that he didn't promise it, just his staff. He can help me check out if I want. His attitude made me feel terrible in this Vegas trip.",1
"Very nice airport! They even have a special line for pre check. That was a great time saver. for those of you that fly often, its a breeze. Very clean, nice stores. some high end stores and great lounges. and thats after security. Before security, there are lots of slot machines but otherwise seems like a regular airport.",2
"Woe is the Phoenix Bar B Que scene! If you love pit Bar B Que, you're outta luck. I stopped here based on an old Best In The Valley review I'd read in a physician's office. I'll say one thing, that reviewer doesn't know Bar B Que from chopped liver! Service, booze selection and ambience are fine but the food ain't pit Bar B Que! This chain wouldn't last a week in Kansas City or Tennessee!",1
"Long wait in line but ,you can always play some roulette or blackjack at the casino tables right next to the Grand Lux. A nice sanctuary from the madness of the casino floor . I usually go for the crispy chicken sandwich but, the salads are pretty good. Once seated at the tables, the service is surprisingly quick.",2
"When you are ready to dish out 400 or more for dinner, you don't want to be told when to eat 7pm sharp and when you need to leave 9pm If you are ready to put up with that.then you found the right place. Otherwise find yourself another restaurant that won't be having you look at your watch while you eat. Arrogance is not on my menu.",1
"I love going here, I just wish it were closer to me. Tip they have 5 matinees! We often make the drive just to save a few bucks and make a date night of it. It's large, clean, bright, and well kept. I recommend this theater if you're in the area! Tip don't bother buying their membership card unless you plan to go here several times a month, it doesn't pay out well enough.",2
"It's trying to be a Vegas pub but not there yet. I ordered a specific wine, they poured a different one? Menu online doesn't match in restaurant. 45minutes after we ordered a cheese plate , salad , burger as dinner, we were told the burger was dropped so another was being prepared. ? What about the cheese plate salad? Keep trying please.",1
"This coffee shop, nicely located on the main drag, was a delightful find. The ice coffee was delicious and paired nicely with the scone I had. Scone had a very unique flavor and I totally dug it! Wifi was speedy, service was friendly. Overall it was a nice find! Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area.",2
The line took forever which i don't mind figuring my first time there it would be great food.low and behold the salsa taste like heinz ketchup.my sonoran chicken sandwich was dry and it took forever. The only positive thing I will say about this place is that they did have good service.very friendly.My first toime there will be my last!,1
"I read reviews on Yelp all the time, but it takes something special to cause me to write one. Green's food absolutely blew me away. The flavors and combinations are just amazing. I was in Phoenix on business and ate here 5 times in 3 days. The sandwiches are the best vegan sandwiches I've ever eaten, and the salads are great too. Friendly staff and a cool atmosphere top it off.",2
"Trevi is a tourist trap in the Forum Shops at Caesar's. Our whole table found the food disappointing and overpriced. The atmosphere is dark and loud the fountain makes so much noise that conversation is difficult . I had the deep dish pizza. The crust was burned and greasy and the tomato sauce bland. My friend's risotto was dry, like it had been under a heat lamp. I can't recommend this place.",1
"I wasn't impressed. Being an ""iron chef "" and always watching hes shows I guess my expectations we're to high. To me the service was slow and the food was mediocre nothing very memorable. I don't think I would go back. Im going to try hes new burger restaurant in hopes that I have a better experience.",1
"I might be harsh on this place, but I fully enjoy the Kiltlifer they make here. The problem with the restaurant, is the price. I've been here for lunch a few times and struggle to find anything worth eating that's less than 12. To me that's too much to pay for lunch in a place like this. The food is good, but not 12 good. You're better off coming here to drink and watch the scenery than eat.",1
The guy who came to our house on Staurday afternoon was crazy. I asked him to park in the street and no block the driveway and he wanted to argue about that. The first thing he did was try to double the price from 85 to 170. I finally pay the guy 85 to leave. Now I need a carpet cleaner to fix up this guys mess. DONT HIRE THEESE CREEPS,1
we got a room in the octavius tower. it smelled of the drain in the shower. we suffered through the first night because we arrived at 2 a.m. and were too tired to complain and wait for another room. the 2nd morning we called front desk to request for another room but we did not get one until almost 5 p.m.! the 2nd room smelled better. but both rooms' showers were very weak.,1
"Though hard to find, this is one of my favorite Thai joints in the area. The service is excellent and very friendly. The food is reasonably priced if not cheap for the area. Being so inexpensive, I was expecting little, but we got a lot, both in quantity and in taste. They also have free delivery in the area! It's a bit of a hole in a corner, but so good!",2
This place is amazing! I have never had such a great experience at the dentist. The small touches like pink filling paper and decor of the office makes it even better. The staff there was so nice and made me feel so comfortable. They showered me in compliments and I left feeling better than I did before I came in. I would recommend them to everyone.,2
"My husband and I decided to try Regions after seeing that they had reopened. The whole experience was just disapointing. The food was uninspired and below average, the prices high, and the service mediocre. I can think of at least five restaurants within a five minute drive of Regions that blow this place out of the water. One out of five stars ONLY because it wouldn't let me leave zero.",1
"We were in the area and luckily did a Yelp search for a late Sunday lunch. The service was pleasant and helpful, while the burgers and fries were fresh and flavorful. A real plus was a gluten free bun that was light and tasty most gluten free breads are dense and dry . We started off with more standard burgers but plan to return soon to try the more adventurous offerings.",2
"Definitely worth trying out when you're in Vegas. I got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Like everyone else says, SHARE! It was only one of my girls and me going at the plate and we barely made a dent. Its super carby but such a guilty satisfaction. Also if you're a fan of bloody mary's, do try the BLT Mary. It was strong, had a spicy kick, and BACON. Totally won me over.",2
"I just left after waiting 20 minutes for the bartender, Susie, to take my order. At this rate the game would be over by the time I ordered. My beer was good but that is thanks to Sam Adams. I will not go back to this tilted kilt. I would rather eat overpriced ball park food. I wish I could have reviewed the food, but my time is more valuable than the tilted kilt realizes.",1
"Thank goodness I didn't read the reviews before I stopped! n The floor IS filthy, but maybe because we are the only ones here, our food is hot and good. n The Quesadilla is the best Katie has had in a long time, my Epic Fajita Burrito lives up to its name, and came with a free soda! n Polite and tables clean. Other than the nasty floor it's a great stopping place.",2
"The food looked great, but unfortunately we didn't get to try it because of the wait. The wait, of course, doesn't deserve the two star rating but the service does. We waited for almost 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by the angsty teen hostess with glazed over eyes, only to be told the wait would be 45 minutes. Lazy Thaiger.",1
"I ordered a ""Lamb Shish Kebab "" that comes with rice. It was for 9.95. Give me some less rice, some less salad but give me good amount of kebab for 10? There were 4 small unflavored hard pieces of kebab. I didn't enjoy my meal. There was so much room for improvement, Had I ordered rice and salad instead of kebab for 10, I might have given it 3 stars.",1
These people will rip you off. I live next door and they will not honor the coupon they delivered to me. They have shorted my order more and more as their business is failing. Stay away from this place as there is much better pizza at a much better price than this available all over the neighborhood. nThis place will be for rent again in a few months.,1
"FUN! This place is a funky bar with another world feel to it, I feel like I had been transported to Eastern Europe for the night, FUN! Both the wine and food menu are diverse and interesting with lots of options for meat lovers and vegetarians alike. Note, try the bread with the feta baked into it its AMAZING!",2
"The bad thing about staying at the Aria is you have to pass by this sweet joint to get to your room. How can one resist? Anyway I ordered the chocolate croissant and quiche lorraine. The croissant was extraordinary! This is not your corner deli, flat bread type of croissant. It's crispy and reminded me of being in Paris. Make sure to finish your dessert off with a strong iced cafe au lait.",2
this place reminds me of back home in la. Went in with the family and no complaints from us we have been here 4 or 5 times already. Seems to be the better of the three pho places around the house and it is cheap. The bill for 4 people with drinks and apps only 52.00. Never really busy which is nice for a quite bowl of soup. I will continue to come back.,2
"I can't give this place 5 stars, since like most everyone else says, it's a nightmare. But I have suffered through the experience to come up with some great, amazing, really finds. Beware the purses though TONS of them were fakes! And make sure to THOROUGHLY inspect anything you are buying for stains, holes, rips, etc Good luck!.",2
This place definitely needs more stars. For 23 you get the buffet plus an additional 6 you can get unlimited mimosas bloody mary's. The food is amazing and they have crab legs pretty sure me and my friend probably ate a mini aquarium lol. Service is great and the food is fresh and delicious. Perfect place to go for a hangover cure or family outing.,2
One of my favorite bars in LV. With hundreds of beers and a whole room upstairs dedicated to Whiskey its a fun place to experiment with new beers and whiskeys. Delirium Tremens on tap. one of the few places in vegas that has this beer! Also Nougat beer by the bottle. it tastes just like a snickers bar. Jack the bartender is awesome as well. and oh! free wi fi ,2
"The only thing I can think of while I was eating my soup was what was I thinking. I should've just save my appetite till I came home. I would have been starving, but I rather be starving than had eaten that disgusting soup. I could have saved my five dollars for this disgusting, salty, chicken vegetable soup.",1
"Probably the best pedicure I've had in Glendale. Super fast, and a great price. The place was clean, the staff was very nice, and they did a fantastic job. Plus, since two of us came in and got pedicures at the same time they gave us a voucher to come back. The gel nail polish is 22 or 20 M W, which is a great price. Would definitely come back again and recommend to anyone in the area!",2
I was a fan for years of the Coffee Tree in spite of the lack of seating due to endless working students with laptops. I changed my mind when twice in a row when I asked for a spare paper cup to split my coffee with my wife I was told we dont do that. Starbucks does and is a lot friendlier. I hate to down local companies but Coffee Roasters is acting like a franchise not a local coffee shop.,1
"My wife got her 5S screen replaced here. Four days later the replacement screen cracked for no discernible reason. Just a single crack coming from the speaker and moving down the screen. We called the store and they said they wouldn't cover it and a replacement would be full price. I wouldn't recommend them, as both the products and services are inferior.",1
"Man has vegas changed! The standard tower room is where we stayed since we didn't think we'd be in the room much. For the price which I got at a STEAL it wasn't bad. But, we had a view of the brick wall of a tower. The pillows were over stuffed. NO tub was a huge turn off for me. I've stayed at 2 star hotels that had better accommodations. Not cool. I won't be back.",1
"Awesome place to stay.away from the chaos and crowds plus i got one night free. i paid 69 a night and got a huge suite living room w couch, bar flat screen tv a separate room with king size bed, flat screen tv and hot tub . staff is friendly and room service food is good. i'm definitly coming back here next time i'm in vegas!",2
"Cute park in downtown Vegas. It has a very family friendly vibe and kid playground in the middle of the park an oasis of sorts in Vegas. Great outdoor space for concerts and events. The stores in the actual containers are on the small side. Because all of the stores have their doors closed, it somewhat detracts people from actually entering the stores to check out their products.",2
"Food is incredible. Service is perfect. Ambience needs some attention. Cafe Berlin, please get rid of the fluorescent lights. I'd come back more if the lighting didn't give me a headache and make me feel like I'm at a Wal Mart. But if bad lighting and cheap chairs and tables doesn't bother you, then you will love everything about this place.",2
"I was disappointed with Blue Nile. I normally go to Cafe Lalibela right down the street when I want Ethiopian, but I thought I'd give this place a try. Most of the food tasted like it had been cooked yesterday or was made with canned vegetables. Their salads are good, but the entrees were a waste of my money and I definitely won't be going back.",1
This used to be my favorite but now has lost its lovin feeling. Slow service rude waiters. View is still good. Not worth the wait and very cramped with tables. Only a few inches from may table to the next. Staff appears not to care anymore. This place is off my list. Too many other great restaurants in town.,1
OMG Korina A is crazy! I followed Nathan and Kris. Romanellis is OUTSTANDING! Delicious subs I will be back again and again. I will tell all my friends this is delish! You have to try the Italian sausage sub YUMMMMMMM! I love the meats and cheeses and the atmosphere. You can get anything you like Italian in this joint. LOVE IT! Right up the street from my house can't be beat!,2
"I took my daughter here tonight to get her snake bite piercings done. She was peirced by Brandi and she was very meticulous with the placement of both loops. She made sure they were just right and she was very good at explaining the after care to my daughter and I. I would recommend to anyone looking to get piercings done, to go see Brandi at The Jungle Zone.",2
Epic experience ! 3 of us tried the nel diablo just as it sounds hot as heck burger! nContinental Club best darn turkey burger EVER ! nThe Goodnight amazing angus cheese burger with jalape u00f1os caramelized onions. We shared 1 4 of the burgers and they were all so good to pick a fav. The fires hands down awesome !,2
"Only came here out of convenience. Spent 5 on a regular cup of coffee that would normally cost 2 in the outside world of Starbucks. I wouldn't complain much if my coffee wasn't gross and watered down. nWould never come here again, I was better off spending 5 on wells drink at one of the bars near the south elevator entrance.",1
"I was actually quite impressed by the pizza here. I believe what stands out is the freshly baked pizza dough the right ""crispyness "" with a nice soft fluff in the crust. Once of the few pizza places I would consider returning to. The cheese and sauce is whatevers but the crust is what stands out here. A perfect and somewhat classy sit down place to go after you're nine drinks in from mill ave.",2
"For the money its not worth it. I have had better meals at King's Fish House. The arrogance in the air was hard to stomach and I was not impressed with the food. Nothing was bad, but for 300 plus dollars I would expect to feel like it was all incredible. Unless someone else is picking up the tab on this one, I'm io hurry to venture back.",1
Don't waste your time or money. nCould be a great place if nThe staff was friendlier nThe course was better taken care of nThere were misters throughout the course nThere was lighting in the evening. n Even dim lighting nThere was more covering throughout the course. Disappointed. nDo not plan to return. Could easily be so much better with some simple improvements.,1
"This is the real deal. It's delicious, it's well priced, it's a Montr u00e9al landmark, and you should come around 11 12 so you don't have to wait as long. The cole slaw was so different refreshing. I made the mistake of sharing a sandwich with my friend don't do this! You should eat as much as you can, because 2 hours later, you'll be wishing you had.",2
"Stopped in for some of the biscuits and gravy I have been reading about at their Cafe. Have to admit, the value is amazing for them! The food was good and the service wasn't too shabby either. The cafe's decor was surprisingly updated and interesting. The photo slideshows showing on screens throughout the restaurant livened up a casino cafe.",2
"Quoted one price over the phone, never saw my phone, sent me an invoice to prepay no parts in store for a high amount , I called and emailed 2x's to send me another invoice or correct me if I was wrong. Nothing no call no email nothing . Too bad dont like giving bad reviews but feel like had I paid online i would have been screwed!",1
"Lunch at this buffet is pretty decent for the price of twenty five. I had the roast beef quite a number of times along with the king crab legs. The apple burrito was excellent and so was the toast. The chinese food was okay. But to top it off, the buffet had great deserts from the flan to the italian ice cream.",2
"cute place. great food. somewhat disoriented service, but i think they were just especially busy. we split the fresh vietnamese spring rolls and i got the tofu pho and they even offered to make it vegan for me i didn't even have to ask . it was delicious. really the only place in the area with pho.2 thumbs up!",2
"As a New Yorker I have a pretty high standard when it comes to sushi. I found Sushi Roku to be a good spot for anyone visiting Scottsdale. The food was great try the special rolls and the service outstanding. We selected a roll that we didn't like, they were quick to comp us despite us not asking and the manager stopped by to check on us. I found this refreshing. Seems like a good spot for groups.",2
"Had to use the drive thru, because I was on a road trip with my puppies, and it is just too darn hot in NV to leave them in the car for any reason. That said, I got an iced coffee and some fries, as that was all I could find on the menu that was vegetarian. Now I remember why I don't go here. Then I realized, if I could have only found a Taco Bell, I could have had real food!",1
"Very beautiful theater, the layout is amazing! They have these seats that recline and go all the way back if you're in the front row. That way you're not breaking your neck while watching from the front row. They also have one of those cool as coke machines so you can get free refills on coke and slurpies as well.",2
"Phipps is soooo pretty! They have a wide variety of exhibits and they are constantly changing, so every time you go back you can see new things. I know you can rent out some areas, and some people have weddings there, but I imagine it would be pretty expensive. Phipps is a great way to spend a few hours on a lazy weekend.",2
"It pains me to give this 2 stars, the brewpub was a stop on every Vegas trip, 2 3x's a year, and it's still where I'll go to watch the big game of the day over an appetizer and beer, but it isn't the same. The beer is no longer brewed onsite, and there is a noticable lack in quality, but their beer list is still among the better on that end of the strip.",1
"Teavana made the best ever tea, Earl Gray Cream and now they have changed it for worse! nNow you have to use twice as much and the second cup you cannot drink as its so weak. NOT A GOOD CHANGE, put it back to what it was and keep the quality up, dont try to save money by using cheaper and making it weaker so you have to use more. BAD BAD MOVE!",1
We were disappointed on our most recent trip to LV to find that this place has discontinued its seafood buffet on Sundays. That Sunday buffet was one of the best kept secrets in LV and was simply exceptional. We had a disappointing lunch most recently and probably won't go back after many years of Sunday morning patronage.,1
"Stayed at Sofitel, excellent hotel. Booked at Renoir for V day strangely had rsvps available only 3 days before hand . Now I know why they had space. Oysters were fishy, food was bland tastying, though serving sizes were typically french which I like. Went to another place after to eat something tasty as my wife wasnt so happy with her vdays din dins.",1
"Expensive and not very good. We had 4 burgers 3 of us thought they were pretty tasteless and the 4th one liked it, but it wasn't worth the money. There are much better burgers in Madison. The space was energetic, but they need to do something about the sound level put in some soft surfaces to absorb the noise . We had to yell to hear each other, and could not hear the waiter at all.",1
"Heard so many great things about this place, but when I went for lunch on a Monday, it pretty much was a disappointment. Selection of foods was paltry and no seafood at all except for the cocktail shrimp which they put like three at a time in a little cup. Will give it another shot maybe for dinner next time though.",1
"Our favorite place close to home for breakfast, lunch and dinner too. Got company visiting? We run over and get a big batch of breakfast burritos. Best local place for authentic Mexican food! We're here at least once a week and tell everyone we know about it and we love supporting local family owned businesses! Enjoy!",2
"Cute little place. Didn't have that overwhelming acetone smell, kind of smelled like coconut actually. Was offered a bottled water when I got there. Everyone was really polite. Payed 40 for French tip acrylics with a clear gel polish coat. Did have a lot of bubbles in the acrylic though. Not super impressed.",1
"Food is good, service is horrible. Came from Encore beach club, wearing a 100dollar bathing suit with a dress cover we bought from the hotel and they turned us away because of their ""strict dress code "" of no beach wear. We went to our room, changed and came back only to see tons of people in their restaurant dressed how we originally were.",1
"Do you have a place that is your ""go to "" place when you just want something that tastes good, in a pleasant environment and doesn't break the bank? Aladdin's is just that kind of place. Sometimes it gets pretty busy there, but customer service never suffers. The Lebanese Middle Eastern Menu is broad, and delicious. The wine list is more than adequate at really affordable prices.",2
"Went to the store in terminal A, service was not very good. Manager was talking loudly on cell phone while not doing anything. They wouldn't fill my travel mug and had to waste an additional paper cup to keep my hand from getting hot while pouring the coffee into my cup. Not impressed, not what I expect from Starbucks.",1
We drove 25 minutes to this place because we had a 5.00 Restaurant.com gift certificate I bought last week. They would not let us use it waitress said the boss isn't accepting them anymore. So we had to pay for the soda we ordered and then we left out of principal. You would think the owner would not want to lose a sale.not this one!,1
"The food is pretty good, however the menu is very small. The service uses to be amazing and then the past few times I've eaten there their service has been terrible. It has completely changed my experience there. I will def. give it one more shot after all the good experiences I've had there, however if it still has not changed then I will not be going there for a while.",1
"Don't come here if your guy to girl ratio is not at least 1 2, or else you will be required to pay for bottle service. Good news is that there's more girls than guys upon entering. Workers are all snobby and stuck up outside the club. Expensive drinks inside, so make sure you pre drink somewhere else. Will get crowded, so you should come early.",1
"Service was good and friendly staff , But the pizza was underdone and not crispy at all even if it had burnt marks all over, considering the price and the size of pizza is not what i was expecting , lived in italy for 15 years and never had a pizza like this so to call this authentic is a joke, not to mention the fact that it sat in my stomach all night , will not go again",1
"This place is awesome. If you like Greek Salads, this place has the best one in town, in fact it's prob the best one I have ever eaten. This is a great place to go for lunch or dinner, but it is def. more expensive for dinner. All the traditional Greek specialties are delicious, and they have some great pasta selections.",2
"The customer service here is awful, very unfriendly employees. They are also not very generous with the serving size of certain subs Steak, Chicken teriyaki etc. . Other than that the food is identical to any other Subway, but I try to go to the Subway on Waterloo Campus over this one whenever possible.",1
"Birthdays, Anniversaries, Holidays.this store always bails me out! Why? Because I workout at the gym next to it and I usually remember the day before the special occasion while I'm working out.so, after a workout I'll go get the card.then I'm Mr. Hero for not forgetting.ha! There's nothing special about this particular store, except it's location. Will I return? As long as I'm married, hell ya!",2
I wanted a lighter lunch nothing too heavy or super fried so I opted for Greek Island Cafe. The gentleman at the register was very pleasant and I tried the gyro combo comes with fries and a drink . Food came out quick and was super tasty! Stop by if you want something different than chain fast food places. PS. Cash only,2
"Holy son of a cow.this place gets 5 stars. It was cold and windy today with a long line out the door but what did John Mull do? They had a big ass bucket of free beers while you waited! We tried the ribs, brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, mac salad, beans and peach cobbler. I would have to say the brisket and mac salad were my favorite. The free beers while waiting is the 5 star maker ",2
"YUM! Pizza and Calzones without all that Ricotta ! We really do enjoy Rosatti's, their thin crust is crispy and full of flavor. Their Calzones are REALLY good and agaione of that ""other "" cheese to overwhelm you. Good quality products are certainly in place and we keep coming back for more! This is a take out delivery only location so keep that in mind ",2
I enjoyed my salad with the sweet chili dressing. It was spicy. I did observe the gentleman before me sandwich was prepared wrong and my soup was cold. They were apologetic and fixed the problems. I will be going back. I don't mind paying more for good food. I do think the staff needs a little more training. Az Mills mall ,2
"Really diggin the southwest egg rolls and garlic fries not a big fan of the beer but they have some killer cocktails! I had something with grapes and tequila.gosh, obviously I had too many cuz I don't remember the name! Lol I would def recommend and if you had too many.it's in the mall so you can walk it off!",2
I really enjoyed eating here. I liked the decorating and it was inviting. I got the filet mignon and it was good but could have used a little more salt. I tried the sun chokes for the first time and loved them. Loved the bread! I liked the warm fris u00e9e salad but there was a lot of it for just one person. Would definitely go back.,2
"I love this place! It just hit the spot. They have pre planned flavors you can get on a waffle or crepe. They also carry thriftys ice cream. They make the waffles and crepes from scratch. The price is good, the staff is friendly, and the place is clean with fresh ingredients! I'll definitely be back.",2
"27 Tattoo Studio is the kind of place I want to get all my work done. I walked in and immediately felt very cared for. Matt did my work and made sure that I was comfortable and in the loop throughout the entire process. He gave me two great pieces and the price was great for the high quality of work I received. I will be back, and will recommend this place to everyone!",2
"This. place. is hugeeee! I'm not from around the area so when my girls and I came to Vegas we had to come here for. dundundun. TOP SHOP! We love the store although it's pretty expensive so we just had to come. There's a huge Forever21 here as well manny more stores! If I lived in the area, this would defs be a place I would come and shop at often D",2
There's a reason the tour is free it's about 30 yards long. A tunnel with pictures and descriptions along one wall and the factory along the other. My wife loves all things chocolate and didn't like a single thing she sampled or the few things she purchased. It's defiantly best to skip this place unless you just want an excuse to get out of the car and stretch your legs.,1
"Truly stellar Fare. I went with the signature house fried rice and the Singapore noodles with shrimp for my first outing at David Wong's Pan Asian. nExcellent flavor, very fresh ingredients, and when they ask you if you like it spicy, they're serious. I'll be frequenting this establishment win in Vegas.",2
"Everything is pretty elegant and neat. The food is okay, not the best. It lacked flavor and was messy. Another thing is they need to keep the buffet clean. I tried serving my self some food and couldn't because of all the unplaced bins of food in the way. The workers are nice but i think some are quite rude and lazy.",1
Got invited here by one of my chef friends and man it was good. I ordered the sicilian wings which were nothing but delicious and the Chicago pizza which was ok but thats just cuz I'm not a fan of so much peppers. But i also tried the sausage pizza and it was heaven. You wont try pizza like this any where else let me tell you.,2
"Let's go DBacks! It is great to have a local team we can believe in! The Cards do not cut it. Games here are generally pretty good, although the security staff could be a bit more friendly when going through the gates. I think they are all amped up and ready to step on someones neck or something. Oh well, at least the games are fun!",2
"I consider this place a microcosm of the city of Montreal unique, bafflingly inexpensive, and phenomenally put together. Some of the best poutine I've had, though the best part to me were the mini burgers that start at a mere 2.50. The place is small, so be willing to wait if you intend to stay and eat. Needless to say, it will be worth it.",2
"Hands down my favorite place for Chinese food in Madison. Consistency is key for me and IG is always consistent. The pace is slower than some restaurants, but it's worth the extra time. We eat here at least 4 5 times a year and it's always a great night with great service. Cashew Chicken, egg roll, shrimp rangoon and a glass of wine LOVE!",2
"This is what pizza is supposed to be. Thick, chewy, substantial, no nonsense, DELICIOUS. The Platonic ideal. They have a thin crust pizza but honestly I've never bothered, nor has anyone else I know. I'm not sure what the point would be. They lack one star because every so often the bottom of the crust is burned horribly. Sad!",2
"I've eaten here three times in one week while staying at the New York New York. This prices at this place are very reasonable amongst the Wolfgang Puck's and the grandiose buffets. The food here is typical American food burgers, salads, pancakes but it taste very fresh. I had a virgin guava daiquri and it was delicious. If I come back to Vegas again, I'll be eating here.",2
"Apple at San Tan village had the absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced at a apple store. ""Ben "" in particular was so rude to me for no reason. My guess is he hates his job. I spoke with a manager but she had no empathy and it was like talking to a wall. I will never come back to this location. They don't care about customer relationships nor do they value their customers",1
"So happy to find fresh sustainable food in Las Vegas! The service ambiance was great. I had the chicken pesto sandwich with the home made potato chips. The chicken was delicious, no fat or skin. The produce was all very fresh the potato chips were awesome not greasy. I will definitely be coming back here again!",2
"In a word, dissapointed. I thought it would be much better. The bread was boring, my 25.00 Filet had no flavor. My mashed potatos and zuchini were good. My server did not want to be there. There were flies and the grass outside needed mowing and the trash picked up. I had a view of Reds Muffler Shop.",1
This is a great urgent care. They don't have you waiting 3 hours. The wait is very minimal. The staff is kind. The doctor was so helpful. She explained everything that was going on and was so patient. She took her time with us. Hopefully I won't need a urgent care anytime soon but definitely will return to this one when I do!,2
"Me and my husband went here and we were very disappointed! We were seated very quickly and the good came out fairly fast but, the Service was awful! Very unorganized, when they brought out food nobody knew which table it went to. The steak was mostly fat and didn't have any flavor at all! The burger I got was very un flavorful as well! Won't be back.",1
"Stopped by for dinner, food was okay but wayy over priced, and i cant get over the bad service to even be able to give this place a review. Especially with the number of employees just standing round looking at each other. Definitely had a cool vibe concept and will try the bowling alley and the venue and re review. but idk if it can redeem itself for me.",1
"Big Cirque Du Soleil fan. Seen all but O. This one seemed contrived, not inspired. The music is interesting. The acrobats failed twice when we saw them. There's a lot of fluff in the show. The clowns are pretty lame. There's this once guy who comes out and pretty much break dances. It was weak at best. But the sand artist in the middle of the show is superb. Won't be going again.",1
"It's refreshing to see a business and an owner go out of their way to really make their customers happy! Not only did they have a good selection of quality furniture, the owner, Sidney, took the time to educate me on what to look for! I recommend Do Overs to anyone looking for a quality unique piece of furniture.",2
Easily one of my favorite spots for a few delicious cocktails! I recently had a peach manhattan? Maybe old fashioned I can't remember. But it was tits! I'm not even an avid bourbon drinker but I was feeling risky that night and I'm glad I did! The bartenders are awesome and know how to perfectly interact with their guests. Such a perfect addition to Shiloh!,2
The place looks nice but the service is ridiculously slow. They didn't even come by to serve us water or refill our drinks until 50 minutes after we had ordered. Food was ok but nothing special. My dish was also missing 2 items but the waitress never came by so I decided to eat my cold food. Needless to say I won't be coming back and neither will the others that were with me,1
The whole shop is unsophisticated and the theme caters more towards children than adults. I sampled the lemon cupcake with strawberry frosting. The cupcake as a whole was artificially sweet and tasted almost as bad as grocery store cupcakes. Because of the sample I wasn't going to purchase any of the cupcakes. In this case giving out samples did not work in the shops favor.,1
"I have been here a couple times before and had good experiences, but sadly this time was different. Not only was the food barely edible, the service was worse. I would have complained about the food if I could have found the server. Maybe she knew it was crap and was avoiding me. No need to avoid me now, I won't be returning.",1
"Tartan kilts nTartan jackets nTartan scarves nTartan gloves nTweed kilts nTweed jackets nTweed scarves nTweed gloves nAryan jumpers nAryan cardigans nBoxes of shortbread nWhisky marmalade nWhisky honey nMiniature bottles of whisky n Minitatute statues of Edinburgh Castle You're getting the full picture, right?",1
"First timer loved it. Me and my daughter went had 2 single patty burgers each with fries a coke and her a specialty shake price 10.87 nice and tasty bun slightly toasted, onions, fresh tomatoes,with long slice of deli pickle. Went back again daily from 2 to 4 pm or am shakes are half off , their onion rings are off the hook. Im only sorry I didnt try th 5 way chilli",2
"One of the best Pho places in the East Valley. They are generous with the portions, and the proteins are excellent quality. I almost always get vermicilli noodles with grilled beef or pork and if I've been a good girl i'll top it off with some fried egg rolls. The spring rolls come with a little too much bean sprout, but minor quibble. Now if only they'd move a little closer.",2
Jet luxury is a horrible company to deal with. The buy up the worst rooms in hotels and then remarket them. By booking through them you get second tier status and the reason that you stay iice hotel is flushed. I have been waiting for 4 hours to get into my room and no end in sight. Avoid jet luxury resorts!,1
"This place is great. After browsing for a few minutes, we received a demonstration on the different grades of maple syrup with a tasting. Of course this lead to my wife buying some. But that's ok, this is some delicious high end maple syrup. When we were paying, the cashier threw in a bunch of maple candies for us to taste. They are delicious and we will be going back before we go home.",2
Mediocore food in general for the price they're asking. The shrimp tempura turned out to be popcorn shrimp. I couldn't taste the lamb burger I ordered as it was just smothered in really heavy goat cheese. The pasta and pizza is OK. In general I felt kind of cheated weighing in the food quality and price.,1
"Very disappointed in my experience here. Our food was under microwaved and served cold. The Tilted Kilt ambiance was non existent as none of the servers were in uniform. Our bartender, Carl, was the only saving grace. He was a cool guy and upheld a friendly conversation. I likely will visit a Tilted Kilt again, just not this location.",1
My girlfriends and I met here for dinner. There were approximately 10 of us and we were seated quickly since we had a reservation. I ordered a flatbread pizza and I was told that they were out of dough and it would be 30 minutes until they had more. So I ordered the small plate Polpettina to keep our evening plans moving smoothly. It wasn't worth the 11. My overall experience was just okay.,1
"Ive been to a few greatclips and other haircut stores and only found a hand full of good stylist. I go to this location, because of Eric. He cut my hair the way I like it and its always perfect. We always talk story and he has the best attitude. If he's not working, I'll leave and come back when he's in.",2
"I have had some horrible experiences in the past with other dentist. When I came to Harris dental 2 years ago, I had no hope. The Harris family helped me see that there was hope and I could have a beautiful smile again. The staff is so friendly and the doctors are so knowledgeable. I will never see another dentist!",2
"The prices are extremely high, i went here tonight with my mom and i didn't even order anything because of the prices, 15 for a plate of pasta?. Methinks not! my mom got calamari and it was really overcooked i posted a picture! she also ordered a fish sandwich and the fish was literally half the size of the bun.",1
Line was huge. Luckily i came alone and walked immediately up to the bar. Service was good as I was greeting right as I sat down. The beer selection is surprisingy decent. Place is really packed. Even on a Tuesday evening. Ordered the farm house burger. It's a duck burger with an egg on top of it. The burger is juicy and the bacon adds a great semblance of crunch.,2
"Terrible. The only flavor these pizzas have is salt. That's it. The presentation is very pretty, some one certainly cares about the product they are putting out, and its presentation. The service is timely and polite. There is not other way to put it, the pizza is among the worst I ever had. Very salty no depth of flavor, truthfully, I have had better pizza from the grocery store freezer.",1
"Loved Edwina's! Takes Grill Cheese from comfort food to next next level! Great taste, portions, value and service. Amazing few kinks for a new small resto! Worth the visit and love supporting new local businesses! And that cheese donut desert? Thats insane! A winner! I'll be back soon and with all my friends!",2
"The pizza is good. The pizookie dessert is delicious. But, I give big dings for the long wait for food usually after sustaining a pretty long wait just to get a table and the fact that they refuse to take reservations for large parties making it an absolute nightmare of a wait for a large group to eat there. For that reason alone, I can't go back.",1
"Either half the people that work here are retarded or they just don't give a shit enough to listen to what the customer is asking for. EVerytime I've been to this location , I get 1 2 ass service and 1 2 ass haircut. Go to another V's location or another barbershop all together . Customer service here sucks",1
"OH MY GOD! I had the Croissant Sandwich the freshest croissant I have ever had . My friend got the Egg white with tomato avocado Omelette. Super fresh, super good. We shared an order of the French Toast with blueberries whipped cream absolutely to die for! The most delicious French Toast I have had.hands down. Service was great too.",2
"I just got off the phone with them to find out how much it costs for lobster per lb. They absolutely refused to tell me. I told them I live all the way on the West side, and with the cost of gas at 3 per gallon, can't they tell me the price? They said no.it's their policy not to give prices over the phone. When I called all these other supermarkets they obliged.",1
"This will always be my favorite Chinese Restaurant! Hello, 5.00 lunches on Saturday's? I AM IN! The service, food and ambiance is always great. The waitstaff work their tails off to get your food out to you as fast as they can. The salad dressing is made fresh everyday and is the best dressing I think I have ever had.",2
"I wanted to let you all know,especially all the ladies that Ivan of Ivan's Chop Shop is a great hair stylist. His haircuts are great, and he is a color genius. His prices are also very reasonable. He is a perfectionist and artist at what he does. Try him out and let him know that Belinda sent you. You will not regret it.",2
"Really good stuff. Kinda confusing at first because the Thai place is also owned by the same person. Also there was no music on, which was a bit creepy. However, the food was great. Since then I've also ordered delivery from them through Tempe Takeout, which is cool cause I love their selection having Pho. Highly recommended.don't let the inside of this place fool you!",2
This is one of my favorite spots in Vegas! It's a little bit of a trek off strip and was recently moved into this old office stylse building which is somewhat off putting but inside is so awesome! Whenever we're in Vegas we always stop in and play a few games. It is lots of fun and I 100 recommend checking this place out if you have a few spare hours.,2
"Their Vanilla swirl caever go wrong! It's always my ultimate goal for visiting this place. I also tried their croissant, which is another goodie. I'll make more trips to this place so I can try many more which I'm sure will never fail my expectations! The service is very good. They respond attentively and give us enough time to look around without giving any pressure.",2
"We split a breakfast burrito, which had a decent chorizo flavor, but the egg was fake and not very appetizing. The salsa was not good at all and we were afraid to eat it after visual inspection. I also felt a bit sick afterwards and this was the only thing I ate. Chili's express might be a better choice for airport dining.",1
"Very prompt and clean. Basic good service is all I need when it comes to dry cleaning and repairs. They got a couple very bad stains out, which I thought might be impossible. Maybe a little pricey, but being right next to Starbucks kind of makes up for this! And they have a talking register, which is pretty cool too.",2
"Coffee was like water and warm, even after I requested for a change. Pancake syrup was runny. As I poured it over the pancake there was like a film over it and once that was broken, it just exploded on the pancake. Yuck. The only reason I gave this place a 2 star was because the server was really pleasant.",1
"The noise from the air vent was simply unbearable and there was no way to turn it off. I was told the problem ""might "" be able to fixed but still ended up suffering three nights of insomnia. On top of that, the shower handle was broken the morning we were ready to check out. Needless to say, we didn't take any shower. The room may look pretty but it ain't worth the money.",1
"I went in here for dinner because the bar was empty and I didn't have a lot of time to dine. The service was fast and friendly, and they had excellent Italian food and wine! I had a delicious lobster pasta that was made in house and an awesome fritto misto. I hope to come back and enjoy the dining area ",2
"Aside from Jaleo, this is another amazing place for tapas. Unlike Jaleo however, this place is more casual scratch that, VERY casual thus the price is also lower. I still prefer Jaleo due to the distance and the ratio of GREAT dishes vs GOOD dishes is slightly higher at Jaleo's. However, I will be back for the spicy prawns dish which was divine!",2
"I like it here. The pizza is pretty good, the wings are awesome! Lots of good deals to be had here and the service has always been speedy and courteous. Very easy to feed a large group for not a lot of cash. I agree with the below comment. very clean place, even the ladies room is nice and clean hard to come by which is very much appreciated.",2
"Food is a 6.5, prices score an 8. But where they are consistant is service, it is consistantly a 3. They just don't get it. Their best people work when it's slow, the worst when it's busy, cleanliness is missing the mark. And when people leave after having an empty drink glass for 10 minutes, it isn't because they are done, it's because they've had enough poor service and are going somewhere else!",1
"Friendly, fast and cheap! I went in to repair a tire with a nail in it and from the time I stepped out of my car to signing my bill and getting my keys back, it couldn't have been more than 10 min. I just needed a patch and it was only 10! Everyone who worked there was friendly and eager to help me and they gave me a free tshirt to boot. Definitely going back there!",2
"From the nearly inanimate object who took my order to the dirty table to the filthy almost empty cheese shaker to the second rate pizza with the ""not so fresh "" sausage that sent me running to the bathroom, thank you Rocco's for another miserable Las Vegas pizza experience. I hope you'll understand my not asking for a to go box for the leftovers.",1
"I am a road warrior. I am used to eating alone, but I never get used to be treated poorly because I am eating alone. I was really looking forward to eating here, but they would only seat me at a tiny 2 seat table with a total stranger.how awkward that would be. They had 2 tables open, but they were being kept for party's of 2. So, I walked.",1
"Don't bother. Literally the worst service I have EVER experienced on the planet. How do you have 4 people working in the ENTIRE restaurant on the morning of a sold out baseball game that afternoon? Unreal. Words cannot describe it. It was as if we weren't even there, and the place wasn't even that busy. Guess that should have been a clue. Don't waste your time or money here.",1
"Although the large amount of sauce and cheese can disguise the truth, the food that I have tried here is low quality and lacks flavor. Was with a group of six and everyone agreed. Also had one of the cheap margaritas, which was nothing special. Just what you would expect from a 1.50 margarita I am pretty sure the salsa was made using canned tomatoes. I would not recommend.",1
"just ew. dirty bathrooms. nplastic y vegetables. nwatery gravy. nbland mashed potatoes. niceberg lettuce and pink tomato ""salad. "" this is the taco bell of diners.the food is cheap for a reason. do yourself a favor and skip it. when denny's food looks fresh in comparison, you know you're in the wrong place. sigh lola",1
"Summerhall is a great place to hold events. Being an old vetinary school, I've been to interactive plays Zombies! and talks here. Every Tuesday night, the Ceilidh club setup shop here. Outside of that, there are plays, other talks, events and yoga that run here. It's a great facility and highly worth a visit to check out what is on if you are in the area.",2
"Another place I have been going to for quite a while, Bongo's has the best weekend breakfast! The place is fun, the service is great, and the food is awesome! The Karaoke on Saturday and Wednesday evenings is always a blast, and they have live music every now and then on Fridays! And even better, the drinks are cheap and cold!",2
"Really enjoyed Alchemy. Went with my girlfriend and thought it was a great spot for a date but I think it would be great for groups. We were seated right away on a Saturday night and the service was really good. Beer selection was good, cocktails were really good, and the wings are incredible. Loved the cheese on them and they had the right amount of heat. Will definitely be back.",2
"Loveeeee loveeeee. you can't go wrong here, everything on the menu is awesomee! nThe Louisiana chicken pasta is a must, but minus the chicken cause I'm a vegetarian, hehe. The skinnylious veggie burger was phonomal, with their house salad on the side. Great vinegar sauce, ugh I can write a whole list here. Haha. There mai tais, yummy. Sex on the beach. RED VELVET CAKE IS AMAZING!",2
"What an Amazing Ballpark!.any park that has both a Salty Senoirita and a Cold Stone Creamery is Aces in my book! Lots of extras.like the free suntan lotion dispensers, plenty of seats in the shade or on the amazingly soft grass in the outfield seating lawn.1 Note, Park in the centerfield parking lot as the front lot is not yet paved if you want to keep your car clean.",2
"I had previously reviewed the Golden Palace buffet, stating that it was some of the worst Chinese food I've had. Well, this place manages to be worse than it. The place is rather run down. The buffet was really terrible. Food left to sit out in just its oil and a barely lit heat source. It just wasn't a great environment. Try something else, definitely!",1
"Food ok but too salty nEnvironment clean and open kitcheService servers are nice but we have to constantly ask for things. We have 6 people and was given 3 napkins and 4 spoons. nAlthough we have 6 and service was just ok, we were charged 18 gratuity. Not happy about this. nConclusion so many pho restaurants nearby. I definitely won't come back.",1
"Just ate there at the suggestion of a local since I'm from out of town.it was very tasty, super cute atmosphere even in ridiculous heat. BUT! Even though the taste was there at least for the price I had a hard time getting over 1 the hair in my cactus taco and 2 the fingernail in my fish taco. So.two strikes, so two stars.",1
"Checked out this restaurant this morning for breakfast with the family after seeing such great reviews. We were seated quickly but waited longer than usual to place our order. My husband always asks for his hash browns to be well done, they were not. My water and toast tasted strange and my sons pancakes were mushy as was my fruit. I will not be returning or recommend the Black Bear Diner.",1
"Nothing spectacular about this burger. I used to love fat burger for the food, not the prices but my meal was not as I remembered. The burger was under seasoned and the egg was wayyyy over cooked. Even the onion rings were nasty. The only thing that made it worth while was the shake, still one of my favorite fast food shakes and probably the only thing I will return to get.",1
"Great value. Nice people. The Yelp profile makes it look like they specialize in crazy hair styles but they do standard cuts too. The neck shave was particularly nice. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was because their magazine selection wasn't very family friendly but otherwise, this is a great place.",2
"I saw The Dark Knight here, and I must say the quality of thier theater was awsome. The audio was great and added to make the movie even more enjoyable! I wish I could have watched Ironman here. The location is also very nice. Many good restaurants and eateries next door to enjoy before you hit up the movies. Definetly a hang out spot for everyone young and old.",2
"Love the new space, very nice atmosphere! I've been a customer at their old location for years. If you like Middle Eastern Mediterranean food, this is the best place in Wisconsin. I've had Lamb Subzi, and my girlfriend had Samon, both were excellent. Also I've tried their appetizers and they're all great. We'll be back for more!",2
"I can't believe this place was packed when I went. Their food tastes equivalent to bowling alley food, but it's at double the price. It's an abomination to pay this much for chicken fingers. Get 'em at Raising Canes instead. And, unlimited fries are only unlimited if they keep on coming. I wasn't impressed with anything except for the Hawaiian decorations.",1
Found this great breakfast place on Yelp! What a treat! I had the El Paseo omelet. Such a flavorful combination! The service was great. They also have baked goodies! I got a Cranberry Orange Scone to go and had it later that day. It was awesome. I would rate this place in my favorite 3 breakfast places in the Phoenix area. You will not be disappointed!,2
"This place is awesome, we came on league night and while we waited to race a full on brawl broke out. The karts are decent and the tracks are pretty technical, bumping is taken pretty seriously here as were all kicked out on our last race. For more contact friendly racing check out Speedway Indoor Karting, but the karts aren't quite as good.",2
"The atmosphere here is terrible! No music playing, no tvs no literature to read and whoever the guy with the blonde hair and go is just sits in the corner on his laptop. He did get up to take my order when I got here but his social skills are the worst! I had to ask him to repeat himself at least twice because he doesn't annunciate. The calzone wasn't anything to write home about either.",1
"food was nothing to complain about but does mexican food have to cost more than 5? if you enjoy paying 10 15 per person for beans, rice and tortillas, then you've found the right place. we ate there at night and they seated us in a few adjacent booths where lights were burned out and we could hardly see who was sitting next to us. we left a tip and some extra for the light bulbs.",1
The sushi is alright. Service was terrible and annoying and the music is to loud. I was trying to count the number of douche bags and annoying chicks but I legitimately caot count that high. You will wait forever to be seated and ignored if you do not buy alcohol. There are 10 other places I will go to before i go to any Ra resturant.,1
"This is a great healthy alternative to burgers or anything deep fried in this area. Never too busy nor do you wait long for your food. You can see what is being cooked as well, so no funny business going on with your food Owners actually work there and they care about their customers. I will always come here ",2
"The customer service is excellent. The food is excellent for the price, at 5 a person you are essentially paying fast food prices, but you get a bit more here. The service is very nice and the manager always comes to your table and checks up on you. This place can get very busy sometimes. I have better service at this place than I got at Blue in downtown Charlotte.",2
"I'm so happy I found Cuteology Cakes to make the cake and cupcakes for my daughter's first birthday. Alyssa was amazing to work with. Her work was not only beautiful but delicious! Everyone raved about how moist and delicious the cupcakes were. I highly recommend Alyssa, I'm positive she will make you happy like she did us.",2
"Had the fez salad for lunch with chicken, it was huge and wonderful. The goat cheese was amazing and they gave a ton, the whole salad was huge. I ate at the bar cuz it feels more comfortable when I eat alone, and the bartender was very nice. I am kicking myself and forgot to use my checkin! Dangit! It would have helped because the bill was a bit high, but worth it, I am stuffed and very happy ",2
"This place was one of the worst el pollos I have eaten at. No clean tables to sit at, the trash cans in the place had nasty gunk all along the top on the outside and the salsa bar was scary. The salsas looked anything other than they had been prepared that day as advertised. The chicken I had was slimy and pink in the inside. Pretty much turned off to this establishment.",1
"I used the drive thru for a quick drink. Service was quick and communicating my order was painless. The staff was polite, helpful with suggestions, and worked out an alternative when my requested drink was unavailable. He also told me about a special on pastries, so I got 2! An unexpected but delightful treat.",2
"Food was average, service was very poor. We went as a party of six. The menu is standard American breakfast and lunch fare. We waited about forty minutes for the food to come out, except for the person who ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, which took about another ten minutes. Nobody was dissatisfied with their order, but it was really nothing special. Not worth the price or the wait.",1
"This pizza is horrible! I will never return to this pizza place! The whole restaurant is filthy, everything the drinks and the food has a funny taste and is clearly not fresh and is therefore, not delicious as it should be. The pizza looks like it's a frozen pizza from the grocery store and the cashier was less than helpful. I won't be returning here any time soon!",1
"The Peppermill is one of my favorite eateries in Las Vegas. The funky decor adds to the vibe of being in LV. It has the feel of the old school ""Rat Pack "" days rather than the typical Strip bigger is better style. We typically stop there for our first meal after the long drive from Orange County, or else just before we hit the road on the way out of town.",2
"The food is amazing but the service at the Anthem location SUCKS! We had to wait for 10 minutes just to be greeted and then another 7 or 8 to get our drink order in. I could understand if it was busy, but it wasn't. I am a server as well so I understand better than most, but the service we got was just ridiculously terrible.",1
"I've been to at least 4 different Outback's and they are generally the same. This one seemed a little nicer. It wasn't as loud and they didn't so much stuff on the table. Ya know, like, there's more room for those yummy appetizers! The service was great, as long as you don't mind being asked every 10 minutes how you're doing. which I don't!",2
"1 star for your cover 2 defense that lost me 100 on the Super Bowl. I thought yall were going to shut down Fitzgerald. You disappointed me. Wouldn't have mattered if that Big Ben TD didn't get called back and turned into a field goal, but damn your cover 2 D that let Fitz run wild on yall. National Fixed League on them spread busters. Vegas owns the NFL! Sheiiit!",1
"We aren't experts on authentic Italian pizza, so we'll keep this review short.but we have to say that whatever they are doing here tastes amazing! We stopped in for a leisurely lunch of pizza, salad, beer, and cannolis. Could not have been happier with our meal.only downside was that the small venue was a little noisy and parking was a bit of a challenge. Coulda just been the day we went.",2
"Besstes Asiatisches Essen in Karlsruhe und weit und breit. Keine glutamatverseuchte Standardk u00fcche. Dieses Essen hebt sich sehr positiv vom Rest ab, was man sonst so bekommt. Sehr zu empfehlen! Unbedingt auch mal die Suppen probieren! Einzigartig! Einziger Kritikpunkt Hat am Wochenende geschlossen.",2
"My family and I were craving salads tonight so someone suggested salad creations. We live about 30 minutes away from salad creations and when we got there they were closed.at 7 15. The lights were completely off, chairs up and no one inside. Why say you are open until 8 when you are only ACTUALLY open until 7? We were all very disappointed to say the least. We won't be back for a very long time.",1
Wanted to try a different diner for Sunday brunch with my daughter staff was very polite but there were flies flying around and the food was ok the couple next to us didn't like their food either. Very small cramped space would definitely recommend Midnight Diner in South End located off of Carson on South Blvd instead.,1
"I joined this gym because its close by and the price is right, 15 month The gym is very clean. There are enough machines for everyone and they offer all kinds of group exercise classes like spin, boot camp, ETC. The locker rooms are also very clean and nicely decorated. The staff is very friendly too. For the money, you can't beat it",2
"Would love to give more stars but what a cheapass place. Ordered a milkshake at 7 59, by the time it arrived it was after 8 00. They are offering their half price shakes after 8 00. Even though it was delivered after 8 00 they wouldn't give it to me at half price because I ordered it one minute too soon. I hate lazy workers who don't want to be bothered making things right for a customer.",1
"I got the Veggie Omelet and had to send it back the first time. It was alll watery, it was gross. They microwaved it or reheat it and it came back more like scrambled eggs. It came with breakfast potatoes, but no.they weren't. It was hash browns. It wasn't bad, it was just okay. The french toast was okay it was dry, but cheap.",1
The Thai tea is delicious. The lemon iced pound cake is very moist and just falls apart in your hand and melts in your mouth. The marshmallow bar is very soft and chewy with a slight vanilla flavoring. The staff is very efficient and knowledgeable. They are are smiling and appear to enjoy their job. Great atmosphere all around.,2
"Although the cake was good.it wasn't what I had asked for. My cake was dropped and had to be completely redone 1 hour before my reception. I called about a week after to try to get a refund and was promised a check for a small portion of my purchase, but never received anything. I was disappointed in the outcome because I didn't feel that I got what I paid for. ",1
"The service was not great and my fiance was throwing up the food hours later. Also, we did not get everything we ordered. After we ate, I told the waiter, and instead of taking what we did not get off the bill like I asked , he said it was ready and went and grabbed it and brought it out by now we had finished eating and wanted to leave .",1
"This place is a dump! The girls are long past their prime and some never has a prime. I mean you actually want to give some of the girls to keep their tops ON. So when you drive by and see the sign at the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn, KEEP DRIVING do not stop unless you really, really want to waste your time and money.",1
"Excellent buffet. Warm and cold crab legs available. I personally prefer warm crab legs myslef. Prime rib is delicious. Would eat here agiaext year. And they also have a new system that you can buy your buffet dinners through a self kiosk, grab the paid tickets and go straight to the buffet vs waiting in line and paying a worker. Dessert area is also awesoem.",2
"Not so good experience there. They made us wait a lot without even asking for the drinks. The salad bar was too small for the place and with no variety at all. At one point someone that looked as the owner started arguing with one of the waiters in front of the customers, not a nice experience. The food was good, but not remarkable.",1
"Just got my lunch. 3 cheese enchiladas with maybe one teaspoon of cheese total. Served luke warm with very little sauce. A huge disappointment. Had to ask for ice in my beverage and the attendant cashier acted insulted that I wanted ice. She then proceeded to take my cup and dunk it in the ice machine to scoop some ice. This place is a disaster. Run when you see the ""open "" sign.",1
"Great classy sports bar with lots of TVs, good food, and long list of beers on draft. I came here on a Monday night to watch the Cardinals game and the layout was great every direction I looked there was a giant TV there. The only downfall was the wait staff they took forever to bring out drinks and food that's the only reason for the lower rating.",2
"Review of lunch. Great view and location for a tourist. We had the seafood salad and trout, both very tasty. When we got there, the maitre d asked if it was a special occasion, and because it was my friend's birthday, they gave a complimentary dessert. They had forgotten to bring a drink and we also forgot because the food was so good but they remembered and brought it in the end on the house.",2
"Never had a bad meal here. Hotcakes are delicious, Lyonaise potatos home fries are to die for, and most everything else is near as good. Except for the coffee! Which needs some real creamer rather than the dilute milk provided and some extra care with selection and brewing. But the hotcakes are yummy! Also a very friendly, quick, and quality place to cater from.",2
"4 vegetarians just stuffed our faces with 4 different tasty options! Fresh veggies, awesome dips, excellent falafel. Highly recommended, glad we missed our turn for the intended restaurant and stumbled into this place. The dip labeled ""t "" was a very unique flavor that I can't say was my favorite. Two of us spent 21 for lunch so medium price wise.",2
Went here recently for my first time because of the reviews here on yelp and man were they every helpful and true. As she was threading my eyebrows she held a nice little conversation with me and when we were done my eyebrows looked fabulous and were the perfect width for my face. Not to thick and not too thin. Definitely going back to her.,2
Very bad customer service in this location waited 20 minutes for a worker to come and answer my question on a electrical device only to find out he didn't even know what I was talking about and not only that their products are a bit over priced.I found the same product I needed at the Home Depot for 2.00 less and my question was answered.,1
I've eaten a several All You Can Eat sushi places. This one is at the bottom of the list. The sushi was on the low end quality side. The cooked items weren't anything to rave about either. The brie and grape quesadilla was strange to see on the menu. I tried it and it was LAME. PROS Cool inside interior n Super cool employees CONS Quality,1
"You can pretty much copy paste all the previous comments reviews here too. Lazy service, under mismanaged, dirty, poor products. Unfortunate too, because they have the tools and opportunity to be a really, really neat niche. The GC in Litchfield Park is WAY better. C'mon Ground Control, get your managing act together!",1
Had a chocolate cupcake with chocolate frosting and a red velvet. The chocolate was rich and the frosting was perfect not too sweet. The red velvet cake was moist and flavorful but the frosting was a little too sweet for my taste. These were very good cupcakes but were quite expensive at 3.19 for a normal standard size .,2
"The only reason that he is not getting five stars is because he hasn't been returning phone calls. I have always highly recommended him to everyone because I was so pleased with our service last year. However, after recommending him, people are not getting return phone calls. Is he still in business?",1
"I've been here twice and was not impressed. The rolls are so small, the service was slow and I had a belly ache for the rest of the day. I do like their asian slaw but that was about it. Also, this place is way over priced. You can go a few block up to Takara and get a much bigger portion for the same amount and the service is better. Nice atmosphere but the food.I'd skip it.",1
"The. Oysters. Still dreaming of the oysters! Briny, still in their juices, not too big, not too small, not fishy at all. Came for happy hour and tried these little beauties. Some of the best, if not best, I've ever had. You think it wouldn't be hard to get oysters right, but it is. 1 2 off wine and beer for happy hour and they have a good selection of both.",2
the crews act like shit! they forced us to enter the damn cart! One of my friend refused to enter because she didnt want to be together with a bunch of drunk animals while one of the staff told her 'you have to go now' and we were pushed into the damn stupid cart! There is not enough seats inside and it was damn crowded! will never go there again! sucks!,1
"OMG. Hit the restroom prior to ordering. It smelled so bad from long term lack of cleaning that I was afraid to order food. I mentioned it to my husband, who had just returned from the men's room. He said the same thing. We left.feared that the kitchen cleanliness was of the same caliber. Come on guys.a little Lysol and elbow grease goes a long way.",1
"I placed an order for 12 signs 3 weeks ago, I still do not have my signs. I went to the store to pickup a sample of the sign ordered 3 weeks ago and had to wait 40 minutes to be acknowledged. At no point in time did anyone greet me or say we will be with you in a minute. This is the LAST order I ever give to this company. Lesson learned.",1
"We have ordered delivery from Sofia's 8 times now through Eat24Hours. This last order was now the 6th time the restaurant has failed to read directions on our order. Sometimes certain items in my order are just simply not delivered at all. Sofia's doesn't seem to be able to put their heads on straight, so we're taking our business elsewhere. So sick of your screw ups! Cya!",1
This place is terrible. It was a Saturday at about 7 30pm They ran out of wine glasses. They ran out of bread. The table cloths were brown paper. The Manager tried to explain the difference between Syrah and Petite Sirah as some made up crap about Malbec grapes saying it was a meritage. I've had better pasta at pizza hut.,1
"Our favorite local pizza and boneless wings. Always do pickup and it's ready when we get there. We get the white pizza or BBQ chicken regularly. They are always friendly. Wish we weren't put in hold EVERY time we call, but it's just a couple minutes. With all the pizza choices we have in town we always go to Barro's.",2
"I had an appointment at 11 30, I was on time and I'm still waiting! If your time is valuable dont waste it here. Also while waiting I observed a few other clients complain how they overlooked a few details on their car. Wtf is the point of making appointments if they're not going keep them or at least give me a heads up and let me know they're backed up! I hate when people waste my time!",1
"Wow this store has everything from protein powders to pre made protein athletic beverages, vitamins minerals, teas you name it. The mainstay of this place appears to be protein of nearly every variety, though. The staff tend to be friendly and the store is clean, well organized and chock full of items.",2
"This place COULD be cool, but the owners are meth heads and nobody cool goes there. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen anyone in there. It's usually empty when I drive by or stop in. I don't like going there though even though it's really close to my house and it's ""punk themed "". Not really punk except for the fact that it's all beat up and shitty.",1
Nice atmosphere. My companion had the pork tacos which he said were quite good. My fish tacos were a bit rubbery both the fish and the corn tortillas but tasty. The guac was good and plentiful and the salsas and chips flavorful. It's local and reasonably priced so we will go back but perhaps I will select a different menu item.,2
"I love this place, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is slightly overpriced but they do give you really large portions. I have been coming to Yanni's since they first came to this location, they are so friendly. I always get the Lamb Gyro Combo with the garlic feta fries YUM! I love it!",2
"The food was excellent, the staff were pleasant, and the decor is attractive. Good cocktail menu, and they do a proper Old Fashioned more towards the ""old old "" fashioned . The main dislike that I had was that it was more family feeling than I was lead to believe, and it has the huge well lit feeling of a PF Changs which gives it a chain feeling.",2
"Why is Earl's so good? The bun. The combinations. The price. That they are open late. My favs are the Original, the Italian, and the Cannonball. The line can be long, especially after the clubs let out, but the wait isn't too bad. I just don't know how else to describe how delicious these hot sandwiches are! You must try!",2
Dr. Brodkin is a genuinely concerned and competent ob gyn! I've moved around the country and had both of my kids with different ob's many years ago in different states. Dr. Brodkin is an ob gyn like years past when physicians could really get to know you and spend time with you. She is a patient's doctor. I highly recommend her for whatever your needs may be.,2
"Came in after the half marathon on 12 2 12 to celebrate and was very disappointed. The service wasn't that great, took forever to receive our drinks and food, and neither were very good. It was a fun atmosphere for the most part and that's why I am giving 2 stars. I was really hoping for more out of this place.",1
"Stayed a week July 9 16 nIt was not our first stay, but we were as pleased as earlier. Nice, clean and friendly resort. Great pool area there is 2 . Easy to park your car without any additional cost. Large and nice rooms well equipped. They have a wonderful breakfast buffet. Very nice and friendly restaurant employees. Location is also great.",2
"OMG! By far, the best lunch on the strip. I had the white fish ceviche. WOW! And the sandwhiches which are Spanish themed, are great. Think, i had a burger at the ESPN Zone and it was 14. I go to Julians, and it's less. And SO MUCH MORE CLASS! The Gazpacho is excellent. Comes with every lunch. ENJOY!",2
"Schedule appointment for today. NO CALL NO SHOW. When I called to find out whats going on . Find out it was not setup right! WTH. You show it in the computer but it's not setup right. No help at all. ""Makes me even more mad the guy called to make sure the time and day was still good "". Took part of the day off to wait for this person. Guess I will be looking for another bug person ",1
What can I say. When you need tires you need them. For the first time someone took the time to explain to me why they cao longer be repaired. In our heat tires only last 3 to 4 years after that it's a plus. Mine have lasted since 2008 so I am ahead of the game. So when they get old and you keep repairing then they become weak and could blow out on the highway. Thanks Tom for your help and honesty.,2
I had a great time at the Rex. I wasn't sure what to expect from the Rex Theater but I remember growing up on the Southside and my grandma taking me to see movies here when I was very young so I at least knew it would be very theater like. There was some awkward construction happening in the rare of the theater what looked to be a newly constructed bar that took away from the scenery a bit.,2
"Solid food, great service, and a good selection of local beers on tap. The duck fat fries, crispy Brussels sprouts leaves, eggplant frites, bacon and eggs, collard greens, cauliflower casserole, and salmon BLT are all worth eating again, and the butterscotch budino is fantastic. Now if they can only improve the bourbon selection a little bit.",2
"Very funny waitress! I enjoyed the theme of the restaurant. Be prepared to drop money on the food and drinks. I had a plain burger and fries that cost 15 dollars. I'm pretty sure the burger had been frozen, and was not fresh! Also, I bought a margarita. It was 12 dollars and the worst drink I have ever had! It tasted bitter and carbonated. Overall, the food is what gives this place 2 stars.",1
This place sucks. We had a reservation for 3 manis and pedis 3 weeks in advance. 2 of us got in while the 3rd had to sit and wait for the other 2 to be completely done. They are really rough. They push your cuticles too far deep. They don't clean up around the nail when the polish goes over. All our polish had bubbles underneath. Overall horrible experience. Never again.,1
"While I do appreciate their selection, I have to bash their operations. Your cashier makes a mistake and charges my card instead of a return and the response I get is ""your bank may take 7 10 days to process the return "". You can charge me immediately, but you can't return immediately because you are lagging in processing. It's not the bank.",1
"I have eaten her many times over the years and it never disappoints. Vegas or New York locations are awesome, of course New York wins because well it's New York. As far as food the Chubby Turkey club is my go to. Deserts in order 1 Hazel nut crepe 2 Melting Chocolate Heart 3 Banana split waffle. Also anything served in a hug mug is a must. My go to is the dark chocolate mocha latte.",2
"All of these reviews seem to be hit or miss. Mine was definitely a ""miss "". Service was AWFUL, and the hostess was a complete bitch. And the place was not full. Food was mediocre, when we finally got a chance to order and eat it. Wine came very late. nI was hoping to find a hidden gem but instead discovered a stinking turd.",1
"We were a group of eight. Celebrating an adult birthday with cosmic bowling. Great idea! The shoes weren't icky. Bring your own socks! The staff was helpful and we all had a good time. The one complaint, it would be nice if they offered healthier food choices. I'm not a picky eater but there was literally nothing I would eat.",2
"I don't get the great reviews. While not bad, I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again . The chips are cold, salsa is blah to the max. The food is very pretty but lacking flavor except for the cheese crisp which is very tasty. If you do go and have a choice between the red or green sauce, go red , the red has some good flavor to it, the green again is very blah",1
"Rubbery, nearly raw, white outside, pink inside chicken in two different buffet dishes. nI hope they looked at my plate to try to figure out why i simply got up and left, but in my opinion, if you are incompetent enough to put an entire serving tray of undercooked poultry out on a lukewarm steamtable, then anything I can try to explain about what was wrong, will likely fall on deaf ears anyway.",1
Last year was our 1st time using Montti tax and it was great. My husband and I were looking for a secure place because our daughters SS had got stolen the year before. Ivanno helped us through that headache and made us feel safe again. Thanks for everything! Feels good to have a safe and reliable tax service,2
"Update! The manager of Braddock's sent me a very kind email, apologizing for the service and issues we had during our experience at Braddock's. Simply because of this I would be willing to give it another shot. Everyone has an off day and I think highly that he took the time to contact me about my not so great experience.",1
"There were very limited menu options. I presumed that the place had these as specialties but the food turned out to be terrible. Was not seasoned well and had very small portions. Service was below average and when leaving, the waitress watched as we paid the bill. We tipped very little for the above reasons and as we were leaving, the waitress actually questioned our payment.",1
"First, we would have given 5 stars but the host told us he could sit us immediately if we left our table within an hour. BTW, we had RSPV'd and showed up 5 minutes early. The food is very good! The scallops with the grits were delicious! The BF had the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops and the plantain tamale was AMAZING!",2
"Quite possibly the worst hotel I've ever had the misfortune to stay in. One wonders if anyone has ever cleaned anything in this hotel. Sticky carpets, stained everything, water damage, half painted walls, cobwebs everywhere, you get the point. Staff is quite friendly but generally unhelpful. Almost any hotel in the area would be better than this.",1
"So, I admitt, if I could have breathed or even moved when I walked in I am sure I would have enjoyed the band. I like country bars, I really wanted to like this one too because it's so close to me. Golly gee wizz cowboys. it's too packed! If you are not big on crowds don't bother going on the weekends because they pack you in like a can of saradeans. true ",1
"This is a typical Starbucks located just outside of Treasure Island, but be warned as of November 2013 this location doesn't carry the La Boulange line of pastries nor do they accept the Starbucks app as payment. Not a bad place to people watch on the Las Vegas Strip though. Everything else is pretty typical. That is all.",1
"Well, it's cheap fast food fish. I've given it a few tries, and really just not worth it even for cheap and fast. Half of the fish they give you has been sitting in oil and is soggy oily on the bottom. Fries are meh. The hush puppies are really good if done just right, but that's only about 50 of the time. I doubt I will be back.",1
"SERIOUSLY!?!? nthis is coffee? nWhat is the crap I've been drinking all these years? nI've been working in Phoenix for a couple days and can't imagine not having at least one latte a day until I have to leave to go back home. nNothing is as important as getting into Cartel each day! nThankfully, I just learned they have a spot at the airport so I can grab one last cup on my way out.",2
"Stopped for breakfast after picking someone up at the airport. Seated right away but took ten minutes for someone to take the order. While I waited for the food two tables sat down, waited for a waitress and left without ordering. The food was okay but the orange juice I ordered was very watered down hardly tasted like orange juice. Won't go back again.",1
"Food was OK.had to send pancakes back to have them done correctly. If it says ""just like a jelly donut "" the picture shows how it should look well? Why didn't the kitchen prepare it correctly. Had to send drink back.something floating in bottom. And waitress not real attentive. Never came while eating to check on us or refill drinks.",1
Would never use again. Needed to mail via usps. Was told one package was more expensive because they couldn't bend it so it had to go parcel post. Told them I've neve had that happen at post office or other stores. Lady told me I was lucky but this is how it needs to go. Told her if I wasn't in a hurry I'd go elsewhere. The guy working didn't know how to do the postage. Horrible experience.,1
First of all this was my first professional massage so i was a bit nervous. I had 2 really bad knots on my back and my shoulders and neck were in pain cuz of it. I told Jesse the masseuse my issues and what u want him to concentrate on. He did exactly that. He took care of me and probably gave me the best deep tissue massage i have gotten or will ever get.,2
"I was kinda excited to have finally get to eat Indian food since moving from California a few months ago. Today, I've been craving for curry. I had the calamari and garlic naan, they were good. Then, I tried some of the Goat curry which was a little salty, the portions are a little small for the price. I had experienced better with more portions for the same price I paid here.",1
"Food portions were gigantic and flavorless. Service was absolutely despicable. The server was sitting there texting on her phone, charging me 3 dollars for hot water and a tea bag, and I was just sitting there, staring out the bullet holes in the glass windows, wishing I could have gone to Wild Thaiger.",1
"Went through the drive through. After placing our order it felt like we waiting 1 2 hour. It was probably 8 minutes, but no one greeted us ,let us know it would be awhile. etc. Almost drove off without the order had I done that this would be a one star review. The positive? Cookies had just come out of the oven.",1
"Really good pizza cooked in the wood oven. Had a regular pizza with sausage, peppers, and mushrooms that was on point. Second pizza with pesto, chicken, and tomatoes. The only negative was the chicken had no seasoning, and the pesto wasn't as tasty as Defalco's. The red sangria was also really good during a hot day. Worth a visit for sure.",2
"I have had nothing but a positive experience at this gym. We signed up last month and it has been excellent. She is enrolled in intermediate tumbling. Her coach is kind, goal oriented and makes the class fun. My interactions with the front desk stafff have been positive. I just called about a make up and they were happy to accomodate me.",2
I've lived in Pittsburgh for a couple of years now and I just recently had this on my college campus a few months ago. It definitely is known as a Pittsburgh food. I normally don't like cole slaw but somehow this was just different. It tasted good because it complimented the fries with its tartness. I definitely would recommend to at least try and you can even just ask for the cole slaw off.,2
"I love vegetarian food, I make very good ones. But crudescence doesn't have a clue how to make it. No taste, no gourmet experience. I tried to eat a pizza made with buckwheat flour, awful. I would have needed a chainsaw to cut the ""dough "". And for the rest, I had to bring myself to ask for salt and pepper to make it taste something. After the meal, I went home and ordered a pizza.",1
"One of the problems I have with Yelp is that if one was to base their dining choices solely off it, they'd miss out on great places like East Blvd. Some of the best bar and grill food in Charlotte. The mozzarella sticks, quesedillas, nachos, black bean burger, and home fries are particularly good. Plus, if you come a couple times you'll start being treated like family.",2
"Enjoyed the restaurant with friends until my food showed up. I ordered the chicken and fries. I received a lot of fries that were under friedand this little piece of chicken. It was 12.99 for fries and 4 bites of chicken. Everyone else's meal was worth the price. The menu has totally changed. new look, less choices and higher prices.",1
"Sunday brunch is simply amazing. Im a regular there for sure. Girls know my name and always compliment me. They're super friendly and has great customer service. The place is Super chill and great atmosphere. I love their freah sunflowers they have around the shop. ntheir drinks and food are phenomenal. Whatever you order on the menu, you wont go wrong!",2
"3 am . no din din earlier, SO and I are hungry . ""chinese "" she says .no.no.no .not again .not ping pang pong.not harbor palace.no ! I want me some good 'ol school italian .only been to BB in the daytime . nhad classic spaghetti and meatballs, started with fried calamari. SO had shrimp and fettucini .all good ! it's, simple. working class, but tastes great ! ntotal cost 36 .no drinks",2
"Love this Costco! Friendly employees, well stocked, clean, organized. The only negative comment is that during the week there are frequently very long, slow moving lines because only 2 lanes are open. The need to have a faster check out during the week. The weekends are araffed better and I don't wait nearly as long. Bought a Vitamix today! So excited!",2
My friends were trying to by some of the legal weed substitute next door to this shop. SInce they were out of business we though why not try a Cigar. This place was nice and Don really hooked me up. He rolled me a flavored vanilla cigar right there and had me light it up. I have to say I loved it and bought a couple. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for really nice cigar roller.,2
"NY Style Chinese food with all the good and bad that brings with it. Reasonable prices, good food, and less than stellar service. If you're knowledgable on what you want and have the info ready then your service will be great but lord help you if you can't decide. The service is the only thing knocking the final star off. Excellent take out menu, don't eat in.",2
"My go to place for pho! Always crowded when I go, but the service is always good. I like their large menu and I have tried the pho, vermicelli, spring rolls, and fried rice. I think this place has the best pho in Madison. Reasonably priced, too. Feels much like the casual pho place back at home in LA .",2
"My children and I really enjoyed our visit here. Just wish parking wasn't so darn expensive, even with validation 8 . There were four floors of exhibits for the children to explore. Lots of hands on fun. My boys really enjoy building the dam to see if it can hold the 85 gallon tank of water. The human body display was excellent and so was the water balls display on the first floor.",2
"They always have something interesting there. I have found several great pots and pans and other cooking things. They also have a good selection of cookbooks. They also often have cheaper prices than Amazon! Every time I go they have new things. One thing, I bought earbuds that did not live very long before they came apart.",2
"I can't speak for all of the locations for Sacks, but the location on Indian School is my favorite sandwhich shop in the entire country. When we visit Phoenix our trip is not complete unless we have been more than once. nMy wife loves the salads, especially the curry chicken salad. nI love almost any of the sandwhiches. Some of my favorites include the Encore, Symphony, and Overture.",2
"Stopped here for lunch one Friday afternoon and found it to be a great spot! Food was great I had the cod sandwich, others in my party had pulled pork, steak hoagie and the Stoney hoagie. Fries were great too. The waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable. It's a very casual place so don't expect anything more. Definitely worth the trip.",2
looking for a good hamburger place and came across with this place . Right when i walked in a nice guy greet us and guide us to the menu selection . me and my wofe got the cheesburger plus sauteed onions and mushrooms and some fries ohhh my gosh what a delicious and fresh hamburger everything cut and make to the order definetly will be back !,2
"I wrote a review, but it ended up under Nissan for some reason. Horrible experience here. Would not deal with us. Sales man even took his business card back. n Bought my mustang at Peoria Ford the next day. I won't even go here for service now. I realize that it probably has the same owner as here, but I will deal with Peoria Ford.",1
Very cool shop and the staff is nice. Unfortunately I think they are going out of business. The juice is ok not the abdolute best but the shop has great prices. There needs to be more shops like this in vegas because some try to upsale and raise prices. This place is good and should stay in business honestly.,2
200 section is on the carpeted concourse. Love that! Do not buy drinks at the Audi lounge. Order from your seat you'll save a few bucks. Bathrooms are clean and air is comfortable. Parking is a breeze a lot of lots to choose from close to the stadium and range from 5 10. We paid 7 and walked into the stadium about a block away. Love this stadium and will return MANY times!,2
"What a freaking joke! I have been here twice and expected at least a decent manicure pedicure. The wait was ridiculous and non accommodating. I wanted Julie and was willing to wait for her. However was told Julie doesn't do appointments. Um, excuse me? Total waste of time, money and effort. Will never recommend nor come back. Go get your nails done at the fabulous Diamond Nails and Spa!",1
"I couldn't see what people are raving about this place? Oh I take it back. Perhaps it's the crazy portion of the banana split? Or the fudge sundae. Otherwise, it would just be a regular diner's style treats. We waited too long for a table and didn't have any good memory of it. 1 star goes for the cool venue in Caesars Palace, and the other star goes to the cool looking menu.",1
Delicious BBQ! nAnything from cole slaw to beans is so tasty. Old school picnic benches and tables for insides seating. The signs they have on the wall will remind you of a different time when gas was 19 cents a gallon. If you are coming here during the weekday for lunch come before the rush as the lines are out the door! But well worth the wait.,2
Recent stay with grand kids . They gave us adjoining rooms non smoking tower. Very cleaewly remodeled fab pool very kid friendly not overwhelming in size . Convenient location would definitely stay again . Did not try the dining there except for cafe not outstanding but not bad. Also did not gamble since we had kids.,2
"Food was very disappointing and not good. Definitely will not come back here. Would suggest trying somewhere else. For 31 a person.even my freakin 10 yr old, omg, really. Only thing i liked was crepe station and the desserts. A 140 bucks for family of four is ridiculous plus variety and selection sucked. Go to Rio.trust me.",1
Is it possible to give negative stars on Yelp? I think DMVs like to hire the most miserable of creation and make them pass on their miserable vibes to other unfortunate souls. I had a horrid experience starting with an absurd wait time to extremely unfriendly staff. I hate getting my license renewed and try to avoid this place like the plague.,1
"Rudest staff ever! Pretty just belittled me nWhen I went in the gym I had a guess pass and everything was cool. Gave me the your and said I was a jerk for asking him questions about the cleanliness of the gym, hygiene etc. Seriously dude it's a common concer nEdit. I forgot to mention that this guy threatened to call the police on me because I asked for his full name to complain to corporate.",1
"Went here for my daughters Birthday by her request in Vegas there's not a lot of kid friendly fun dining places to choose from! This place is Not for Locals.Great atmosphere, the Staff Servers are very pleasant, but way over priced for the food quality! On line Menu is way lower than this location the kids menu is 10 plus and meals are 25 plus! Food is OK just OK!",1
"I'm a huge fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts, and Zinburger is one of my favorites. I've been in twice since they opened in the Quarters. Both experiences were great! I LOVE the zucchini fries and the turkey burger! The salads are always good perfect balance of ingredients and dressing. Great service. Really friendly staff!",2
"The Panda Express at the Venetian served me the worst Panda Express food ever and I LIKE Panda Express! The food was already ready, like all Pandas, but it tasted overly salty I didn't even order anything bizarre , and everyone else with me agreed. Can't beat the convenience factor, of course. Maybe I caught them on a bad day?",1
"Big box supply stores have there pros and cons. What sets them apart, in my opinion, is the people that work at them. The folks at this HD are friendly and knowledgeable on where products are located. I'm in and out of this store allot and for being a very busy HD they normally have what I need and plenty of checkout lines open.",2
"Very disappointed, for the 2nd order in a row we did not receive an item we ordered, last time it was the stuffed cheese bread, we let that slide, this time an entire pizza was missing, the white sauce with Philly steak and mushrooms did not arrive with the first driver, we had to wait another 30 minutes for the 2nd pizza to arrive, very disappointing.",1
I will confess that I did not have the Taco's which might have been my mistake. Don't bother with the Chips and Bland Salsa for 4 bucks. The Pork Green Chili Mac n Cheese was just OK. If it is Happy Hour and Cocktails you want then this might be your place. Just left me wanting.and feeling like it was just OK. Nice looking place and very nice staff.,1
"Personally, I love Krave as opposed to the other clubs on the fruity loop, Krave actually brings in TALENT! Its great to see national acts that normally I would have to go to Los Angeles or San Diego to see. It seems to me like their promoters put a lot of thought into what people really want to see, and go out of their way to make it a reality!",2
"Major disappointment at this place. Dishes were pricey and quality quantity was low. Maybe we just got very unlucky in the one time we've gone here, but safe to assume we have no plan to return. I was very surprised to see a four star average here on Yelp. So far as my experience, Tommy better stick to clothes which I love BTW .",1
"The first and last time I order pizza from these clowns again! Order took 40 mins more than stated and when the illegal alien showed up,it looked as if someone sat on the box of pizza. Needless to say it was all nF'd up! Smashed! Wtf? I had to scrape toppings off the box! nI can't express this enough! nDO NOT ORDER PIZZA FROM THIS PLACE! nYou've been warned.",1
I am mortified of heights but my husband and our good friend convinced me to get on this thing. It was well worth it. It is the largest observation tower in the world. At its apex it reaches 550 feet. The whole trip takes about 30 minutes. This isn't meant for someone who is in a hurry. The view was beautiful from up top and you could barely feel it moving.,2
"By far was the worst experience, my individual lashes were put on completely crooked and some up side down, I had to try a new salon for a fill because my usual technician was out of town. I had to have them completely removed as soon as I looked in the mirror because my lashes looked like I've slept on my face all night. nWasted 2 hours of my time and completely messed up my eyes.",1
"The show did not meet my expectation seen much better. The same 4 girls n boys perform the whole show more than entertaining performances, they kept singing ! nFood was mediocre didn't care for the cold bread, dry fish n plain rice with no flavours or the boring SWEET stir fry full of broccoli ! Come on I can make a better stir fry.waste of 80 not recommended.",1
Tried to book on line and in person for a party of five. Tickets were only available for four of us and we were not able to attend. There is no flexibility with management to allow all family members to attend at the same time. Unfortunately we didn't see the neon museum We went to the high roller in town. It was awesome check out their happy hour.,1
I had a very bad experience nWith this dentist he seems nice but his work is awful nHe put a new crown 3 root canals on the same tooth for 2 weeks I was tasting a very strong chemical coming out of my tooth and can't still chew on I nHad to go to different dentist to fix my tooth. nStay away from this Dentist. He should not be practicing.,1
"Attended a wedding at Seville Golf and Country Club. The Doubletree provided a shuttle to the event and also scheduled a pickup immediately following the event. On our way the driver didn't provide professional customer service didn't help us out of the van . At the conclusion the ride was over 2 hours late. We had to call multiple times, very disappointed in the service.",1
"This really is a fantastic place to dine or enjoy a decadent cocktail. The ambience is fantastic and there's often great live music. The food is done well and kitchen observable which is always a plus for me as far as cleanliness and sanitation is concerned. Chocolate expresso martinis are fantastic! nAhi tacos, kale salad ,salmon etc.",2
"Went there for the first time. both of us had a burger, the bun was weird, the meat was overcooked and tasteless. We sat the bar and the dirty glasses were right in front of me and I really don't think that should have been. However, the other person in our party had salad and said it was good. I think that it needs some work on bar food if they are going to make it.",1
I am very satisfied with my recent prescription glasses. The owner Mehr is a true craftsman. I require a very high correction and he was able to fit me perfectly in a distinctive frame without the thick lenses. Paris Optique is a 50 mile trip from home but definitely worth the drive . Bespoke service and results at a reasonable price!,2
"I won't stay here again! The first room air did not work, switched to another room the next day that air didn't work! Staff is friendly but did nothing in the way of upgrading our room. I will stay at Paris because they always make my stay a pleasant experience. BTW no WI FI unless we left the room to go to Starbucks!",1
"Manny was on available quickly to service our broken a c. He arrived on time, he had a clean appearance, he was very knowledgeable. He even took time to show us exactly what was wrong and how he would approach the problem. He charged us a reasonable and fair price. We would recommend him to a friend. We would definitely use him again.",2
"I had a great experience at Breakfast Club. The environment was nice with a fresh modern design feel. Fresh grapefruit juice was delicious and the service was helpful and friendly. The breakfast burrito topped with green chili was great. Living downtown, I can see this becoming a regular breakfast place. yum.",2
"I absolutely loved this little place! cozy, warm atmosphere, great drink specials. loved the upstairs fireplace. Had my birthday here and everyone really enjoyed it, in fact, I believe were going back tonite! The live bands are awesome as well as the beautiful view outlooking civic center park. You can even bring your dog for a drink! Too cool.",2
I want give this 2 stars but gave it 4 so people could see it. I was not told it's under construction! The walls are paper thin.I am hearing a party upstairs but I cannot call the front desk bc of remodel. They did give us vouchers for breakfast and dinner appetizers. Everything is clean but I can hear everything. They did give us earplugs for construction. So grumpy,2
"Showed up 15 min before opening, 50 people were already waiting. We were a party of 6 and were given a 2 hour wait time! Not a good place for parties over 4, sweet spot is a party of two. I would recommend arriving 30 min before opening, to ensure you get in. Have eaten there before, food is outstanding. But extremely hard to justify the wait.",1
"This cafe was hardly full at 4 am, but somehow we ended up waiting like an hour for our food. When we got our food, half the orders were incorrect and when they did correct them, they sucked. I know when you are drunk and partying all night, you should be able to eat anything, but this was not the case with this joint. Waitress ignored our group most of the time.",1
"The service wasn't even lousy it was non existent. After sitting there for 20 minutes waiting for someone, anyone Hello? to greet us, we decided the wait staff was just too busy to bother with us. The food looked great, but not so great when other people are eating it and no one is around to take an order. Busy place but you better know someone if you want to eat there.",1
It was affordable but i am in worse pain than I was when I came in. I showed my coworkers the busing that was caused and they were shocked! The foot rub was good but the back rub was painful. You guys can judge for your self but I honestly believe that back and neck are in worse condition. In pain and unhappy.,1
"Once again the food is great, and atmosphere is awesome! However, the server and food runner or the guy refill drinks are so so. We tried the crawfish popcorn, dinner special sirloin steak with crawfish u00e9touff u00e9e, and crawfish and shrimp creole. They are very good, especially the dinner special.",2
"Sunday afternoon for ""brunch. "" Too noisy to carry on any type of conversation. Slow service. My food was ordinary, and the portion looked more like a side dish. Offensively small and therefore very overpriced. I couldn't wait to get out of there. I see several good reviews, but I cannot understand what all the fuss is about.",1
"Update 04.14.2011 Been here 3 times in the last 8 days. The Zha Jiang Mian is my favorite so far. HeHe. Update 04.28.2011 If you go with a large group of friends and you each order a different dish, you'll get to taste a lot more of the Sichuaess, and you'll probably end up paying less than for a lunch special. D",2
"The TVs are nice for hotels, not like Yardhouse or Blue 32 Sports Grill. nThey position delas to you like 2014 Mug Club but don't tell you it's restrictive on Monday Nights between 7 pm to 10 pm. This is a last resort place for me, now I walk in her and wonder what crappy new thing will happen . On this Monday, they only have Coors light on draft . this place is sarcastically brilliant!",1
"The lot is not taken care off owner never responded to our complaint about the yellow bars ruining our car. That is not a way to do business! We never came back and warned our friends! You caot park a sporty car there the yellow bars are too high and too close, they caused some serious damage and no response! ",1
"This place is nasty. I got the chicken and broccoli, it had way to much sauce on it and let me tell ya there was a bone in my chicken. I aslo got the teriyaki chicken on a stick and it was gross really salty it was deep fried with some nasty seasoning on it. If I could I would give this place no stars I would. Never eating here again.",1
"Jackpot! Pizza a Metro is that rare joint that gets the basics down right great food at an excellent value, paired with a charming interior albeit tiny and an owner who understands service and customer loyalty. My only fear is that the place will change as more Phoenicians get wise to this gem. Robert O. put it best, you'd have to be a stone cold douche to think that this place isn't great . n ",2
"I wanted to like this venue since Phoenix has limited venue music options.but each experience of the pressroom i had came off to be extremely disappointing with a very unprofessional "" manager "",michelle ,weak staff, over priced drinks, ghetto parking scenario,so so sound quality etc. with what limited options there are in phx.id go to any venue over the pressroom",1
Great salads and sandwitch selection. So far I have only tried the vegetarian mushroom sandwitch and I love it so much I'm afraid to try anything else. nThe vibe is more modern and upbeat. Food comes out relatively quick. nThey are very busy during lunch hours so try to avoid going there between 11pm 1pm if you don't like crowds.,2
Everyone who works here is extremely friendly and helpful. For some unknown reason I have panic attacks every time I visit the dentist so I never went as often as I should have until coming here. They do a great job working things out with my insurance so my out of pocket expense is as low as it can be. I was referred here by a friend and I would also recommend this place to anyone.,2
"We have been going here for years and I have no idea why I have not posted a review until now! nNot once have we ever had a bad experience! We love to go on the weekends when it's cool enough, listen to live music, have drinks and that delightful Creme Brulee. nThis is a place we like to take out of town guests, they are never disappointed.",2
"Happy hour is a good price, but the food is not worth it. Half the food seemed a bit cold on the inside, which meant that it was frozen before Being fried. The chicken liver p u00e2t u00e9 looks like watery cat vomit. If you like bland English food and no flavor, this is your place! Wonder what will replace English's this fall after it shutters.",1
"The frozen yogurt here is pretty tasty. i had the tart peach which is delicious and topped it with strawberries and blueberries. Tasted really refreshing and hit the spot for my cravings. The only thing for me is that there is a small selection. I'm used to self serve yogurt places with 10 or more flavors but here there isn't quite so many. Besides that, the yogurt here is yum yum yummy! ",2
I understand that all of these hotels feel that when you come to Vegas that you have cashed out all of your savings and are willing to spend copious amounts of money for EVERYTHING but c'mon 14 for a small bowl of wonton soup? I received three small wontons with some fresh julienned carrots and two tiny leafs of bok choy. Next time i'll take a cab to something better.,1
This store needs a MAJOR makeover. I feel like I'm walking back into the mid 80's when I go in there.which isn't very often because its just dirty and old in there. They also don't carry a lot of things that I find in other stores. Come on Albertsons give this store a makeover it's practically in my backyard and would be a huge convienance for me! nLets move that bus!,1
"For someone that does not like raw fish or anything too authentic like my husband he's a regular sushi eater! Island sushi is amazing! My husband can enjoy the ""authentic "" sushi while I enjoy they're amazing shrimp and garlic chicken! Definitely give them a try even if your not into sushi. They have other amazing things to offer I love them for that! Oh and they're desserts are so so yummy",2
"Wish I could write a review. The menu looked tempting online and I took immediately to the Ham, Egg, and Swiss waffles. There is a location very nearby but I have never been. So I called for takeout breakfast. After the hostess answered the phone I was put on hold for 8 minutes before I finally hung up. Nice try but I won't bother with Mimi's again.",1
"Stopped in here today joined by Mike C. for a first visit to this Cracker Barrel fourth visit ever to any . This time I ordered Meat Loaf, with mashed potatoes beef gravy, turnip greens, cole slaw, one each of a biscuit a cornbread muffin. The serving sizes were excellent, the price low 8.79 , every bite of this meal was SOOOOO good! ",2
"So i went into sunflower market today to get some chicken breast, Corn on the Cob and Milk. The chicken breast were 8.99 a lb and the corn on the cob 2.89 for 5 and the Milk 2.69 a gallon. The milk comes from Sarah Farms out in Yuma. Now Bashas carres the same milk for 1.69 on sale and 2.29 normal a gallon why the huge mark up?",1
"Every dish I've ever had from here has been excellent. My favorite is the Peanut Sauce Lover, for obvious reasons. I always ask for no onions, and for a place where it is kind of ridiculous to request that, they have never complained and have always left them out. It is a bit expensive, so I go there when I'm looking for a treat.",2
"So. I ordered for delivery at 9 13. It was quoted at being delivered between 10 10 and 10 20. Received a call asking me if I still wanted the food delivered at 10 30. To be delivered in 30 35 min. When I asked why I received a reply of ""we are very busy. Do you still want food? "" Awesome! Great customer service!",1
"Had to take off a star for our latest visit. Sat in the center section in front of the kitchen and the noise level was too much. Between the music and the folks trying to talk above it, it was just plain annoying. Only thing that saved the days was the consistently good chow. TURN DOWN DA MUSIC Flemings!",2
"I went to Labcorp to have my blood drawn. It's hard to say something nice about people who poke me with needles. but their staff was lighthearted and kind to a poor girl who's squeamish about giving blood. r n r n 1 star because their lobby is small and their lovely flat screen tv only loops mind numbing healthcare ""infomercials "".",2
What a very beautiful place. We came here after dinner. We were greeted by Jason who is an awesome bartender. He suggested a few cocktails. I tried the Rose fizz. It was so refreshing and delicious. Jason was very helpful and was very knowledgeable. Loved it here. This place is really chill. This is a must place to visit with the beautiful chandeliers.,2
Tourist trap. Looks good but overall disappointing. The tequila was great once we finally got it! Food was mediocre and service was just plain bad! nDo yourself a favor skip the Cantina and brave the heat to Margaritaville at the Flamingo were you will be well served in a fun environment with great food and drinks!,1
Absolutely no customer service! The waiter doesn't even offer a greeting just rudely asks what we want and then quickly walks away before we can finish what we're saying. Food is just ok. Decor is outdated. Definitely will not come back here. Good luck getting the checked. Waved down the server but they ignored us. Not that we wanted to pay for this awful experience.,1
"Best Thai in Phoenix in my opinion. I love their extensive menu and the service is great. The Chef here cooks ALL the time, so the food is consistent and wonderful. Try the Phat Thai is the best I've ever had and I've had a lot of Phat Thai . Always clean and has a fun and funky interior design. Enjoy!",2
"Not a mean one star, just a really really mediocre place. Waitress was sweet but she said a total of 3 words to me. They overcomplicated their menu you get 3 menus and the food was very bland. Fresh ingredients were lacking and everything just seemed cooked from frozen. I can't speak to their drink menu but i definitely won't be back.",1
"Pretty good for only 8 bucks. If your looking for a crazy clean and wax plus detail and stuff, you may need to spend a bit more money. But if just want a good quick clean its awesome. Real fast and the dudes actually stand inside the machine and clean your car. Then they hand dry. Pretty good value for 8.",2
FANTASTIC! nLoved this place! Love the artwork! Love the paint palette tables! nThe service is the first excellent thing! The food is also fabulous! nThe waitress was so nice! Great job guys! nFood came out fast! The chef must have been in a creative mood that night! He brought us a few extras! Bacon wrapped morsels of goodness!,2
Please do me and yourself a favor go somewhere else . You will be saving your time and money . First off worst customer service I have ever had and horrible over price Mexican food. I would rather go to taco bell then go eat at guedo's again and I come from a small town on the border of Mexico so I know how Mexican food should be .,1
"Fast food au top! Les burgers sont certes plus ch u00e8rs qu'au mcdo mais bien meilleurs ! nLors de notre commande nous devons choisir le type de burger cheese burger par exemple puis la garniture qui l'accompagnera tomate, salade, cornichon, mayo . , ensuite les burger sont pr u00e9par u00e9s sous nos yeux. Les frites natures ou u00e9pic u00e9es sont u00e9galement tr u00e8s bonne.",2
"Love this place! nI'm always going back, this is one of my favorite restaurants in town! nThe only reason why it's getting four out of five stars is because we've had a bad experience once which THREE dishes that had to be put back in the kitchen just because they could not get our order right. But other than that any other time it's been good the food, the service and variety.",2
"While I would consider this place for smoking rather than retail buying, I love it. Great vibes, good music, and amazing smoke. They also allow reg tobacco use which I dig. Prices and customer service were right on par. Even their take home blends smoke amazingly well. Staff goes out of their way too, to make sure you are comfortable and relaxed hanging out with company.",2
"Mediocre food with not so great staff. Dined here with a pre ordered party of 20. Food was ready for us laid out on a table next to our party and getting COLD. One not very articulate server made for even more difficulties it's not as if his job was really hard, the order was already made he just had to hand it out courteously. I was here once before on salsa night wasn't too impressed either.",1
"The Girl spent a good 40 minutes in here and came out with some more goodies. I bided my time at Sony Style and the sports memorabilia store where Dick Butkus was signing autographs. She came out super happy and even had a free James Perse bottled water. Wow, the label is simple and clean like their branding.",2
DEFINITELY definitely not the best buffet in Vegas! It was really cheap and that was probably the best thing about it. I can't remember any item that I really enjoyed. I just remember that my boyfriend and I were disappointed from the first plate we filled up to the last plate we struggled to finish. Never again.,1
"This place is a joke.horrible service.ghetto and why are the people in the back the whole time doing nothing but standing around looking like idiots.we didn't get greeted or even a hello, just a response on how many and what table would you like.really, really, oh and it took 30 min to get food which they are fully staffed, makes no sense to me.",1
The pizza at this place is great and the ice tea here is amazing. I will definitely be coming back again. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the place could be a little cleaner and service was a little slow. I believe the service was slow because they only had one person working in the whole place.,2
"I have been to Claim Jumper in CA. They have been great! The one in Avondale is just ok, I have been coming back a few times and it still has not changed my mind. The service has been just so so. One time my chicken was served under cooked. I do not know if I will return. I still love in Claim Jumper in Deer Valley.",1
"The owner is usually here and he is very friendly. I had the lentil soup that everyone raves about, it is good but mine is better! The fattoush is fab and the veggie dishes are all great. I always get the Mezza appetizer a plate of pure deliciousness! Their tabbouleh is some of the best I have had. Great little place with good prices.",2
"This is my first visit here, passed by several times. It's an OK place, Average burger really. What sets them apart is the thin grilled burger, but not to my liking. They do appear to have a lot of interesting ice cream dishes. This place is a head above Smash Burger which is real greasy. So maybe give this joint a try if you like thin grilled burgers.",1
Wow this place sucks. I've never been to a breakfast place that doesn't include toast or sides and charges you for jam! It feels like you are eating in a garage and its pricey for not including anything at all on your bare plate with a small portion. Go to Mr. Mama's instead it's cheaper and tastier.,1
"The ladies who work here are super nice. BUT the man who works here is dreadful! Every time I encounter him I leave wishing I had never gone there. Which is why I have decided I will no longer bring my business to this location. He is rude, condescending, and acts as though he is doing me some huge favor by providing me with his service. I think not sorry but someone else can have my money.",1
"I have eaten at the Veggie house several times. The food is good, but the service is normally pretty slow. Do not head here if you are in a rush. I normally get sweet and sour pork. Pretty tasty dish. I have tried some other things, but did not particularly care for them. This is predominantly Asian based, and pretty heavy dishes.",2
"Generally speaking, the service is good I've had some bad ones. The food is pretty good, but the reason to go is for the brunch. It can get crowded, but worth the wait. They make their desserts on site, and make omlettes and waffles while you wait. The meats can be overcooked, but it's still all quite tasty.",2
Love love love all the sad flavors and this is the only place in town I can find Harry Potter candy and butterbeer . My boyfriend loves the green river soda so we will back again and again. They are always friendly and now have a punch card for discounts! Awesome place for gifts and out of the ordinary stocking suffers and b day treats.,2
"Stood outside the store at 7pm the other night while the employees stood there and looked at me from inside. Granted they close at 7 but a little acknowledgement is what keeps customers. I had called before 7 and no one answered so I ran over to exchange my box. Cox, it's a competitive market out there. Maybe the other cheaper services out there won't be so arrogant.",1
"I shared the sampler platter with my boyfriend. We chowed down on jalapeno poppers, onion rings, fried zucchini, mozzarella sticks, and wings. I never knew bar food could taste this good! I loved the down to earth atmosphere, great food, and reasonable prices. I can't wait to come back and try the Philly sandwiches!",2
"I have started to hate walmart. The prices are low, but my time is worth more than the savings. They never have enough cashiers and there is always a huge wait. Taking something back takes longer than LA traffic! I have decided not to spend my money there. Get your customer service and manpower issues together!",1
"DO NOT order from this place. They will scam you out of more money in an attempt to run up the bill. I attempted to order from them because they are open late. I ordered extra meat and cheese on one sandwich, I paid 2.50 extra. They call my house at 11 30 at nite to tell me that if I want the extras I have to pay an additional 1.50. Never again.",1
"Really good, quality stuff! nI usually get the seasonal flavors, and this visit it was Pumpkin Pie and Passionfruit Sorbet. They were not mixed! That would not be good. nI really liked the sorbet, which I haven't tried before. Pumpkin is always good, and I can't wait to see what they have for Christmas!",2
As soon as I read the article in the Post Gazette about this new place on the Northshore I couldn't wait to go. As a beer lover this place was right up my alley and I had high expectations. The Beer Market definitely lived up to them with 50 great beers on draft I ordered the Banana Bread and Fatheads Bumbleberry. A great place to go before Pirates Games or with a big group of people.,2
"Not impressed. Fish for their sushi was not fresh. Not sure what the hype is all about. Sat at the bar to have AYCE. Felt rushed by the sushi chef. Asked for recommendations and before you know it, we were getting heaps of food. None of which was ordered. There was nothing spectacular about their dishes. Our servers were deasant.",1
"Well, in more recent visits here the flavor selection is really limited, and not good. They usually have 1 SF flavor now and it's not good. The regular yogurt itself is just so so. Not nearly as creamy and delicious as it used to be. When stores change hands you can usually tell a difference. Sorry!",1
"First of all there was a ROACH crawling on the wall by son! We started to leave, the manager apologetically moved us and asked us to stay. she then comped the dinner., I couldn't eat because I was grossed out so I took it home to my husband and son and they said it was bland and disgusting! Do yourself a favor and don't eat at this Olive Garden! Terrible!",1
"Saturday night, no manager on duty. A staff that is forgetful, can't admit their own faults, and adds bogus charges to the bill. Nickle and dime you for everything, no free refills on anything, at all. Overpriced entrees and drinks. Bean staind table covers. Resulting in the worst mothers day dinner.",1
"Not the worst BBQ I've had but expect to end up with some luke warm and dried out meat. The brisket is average at best. Wasn't a fan of the pork at all. Really, it's nothing special but if you absolutely need some BBQ and you're in the area, it's decent. Otherwise, there are better options in the east valley.",1
"Cheap and perfectly adequate. The kind of place you order from because it's close and cheap. If you're willing to travel farther, wait longer, or spend more, go elsewhere. But this is a fine option, and you can get a lunch special with an entree and fried rice for 4.50. I like the broccoli with garlic sauce the sauce is good but not great, but the broccoli is perfectly cooked. Mmm.",1
This place definitely gets big points for being friendly. Their drinks are okay and on par with some of the other boba teas around the area. They love their customers and are not shy about it. Check out the Polaroid wall to your left corner on the far side of room Service with a smile and good drinks.,2
"Came in on a Friday night eager to try the new app for the giftcard. Ordered 2 drinks, handed her my iPhone to scan the giftcard and I was told, ""I can't take that! "" with some blond attitude. Um. Didn't Starbucks launch that program? If she had beeice about it, I'd have no issue but she wants to give me attitude for what Starbucks had been advertising.",1
"This indoor mall of 170 shops is on the Vegas strip connected to Planet Hollywood. It doesn't seem like there's that many stores in there, but I guess so. It has some unique stores and restaurants that aren't at most malls. There's both a Wyland and Godard art gallery too. A person can do some pretty good shopping there.",2
"Dad was injured and we bought a ladder from Costco and they offered to help us load it. We waited 10 13 min and no one came to help us and they just said ""oh they're on there way "" uhmmm yeah we gotta be somewhere, we're not going to wait 30min for help. All the workers were chit chatting and ignoring us. Not good customer service.",1
One thing i left out. House keeping WILL ENTER your room no matter what. Even if you have privacy do not enter they will. We left our Tv on Saturday and came back to it being shut off. We theoticed a piece of paper left that said house keeping comes in for a safety check. F U HOLIDAY INN! Your people are corrupt and i am sure they are in cahoots with the thieves!,1
Not the most friendly place and they are slower then Jamba Juice. If you are the last guy to order your shake you will be the first guy to get it. nThey also do not have nutrition facts listed for their shakes and when asked it required a lot of fumbling through big binders. I might go back and give them a 2nd chance.,1
"Clerks will lie to you and deny replacement warranty coverage. Signed up for one plan, had paperwork in hand, and was told that wasn't actually what I signed up for! Horrible service! Can't wait to get out of this worthless contract! When asked to get a phone number for manager had to wait 15 minutes to get the card, Never using Verizon again!",1
"12 26 13 update Well, they no longer serve several flavors of yogurt, highly disappointing. They're going to switch it out for some shaved ice and the woman was quite rude to me this time around. I might just not make the extra three miles for some quality boba and stick with bomboba with their mediocre drinks.",1
"the food, Hunan Beef, is outstanding and the portions large. best chinese in the neighborhood. the decor is showing age including torn carpet and black electrical tape on the booths, some of which have been recovered. this place is on its way to becoming one of the top Best Dives. presently, however, it has too much class. Enjoy!",2
"Quick, cheap, and always fresh at least when I go I always try to go after 1pm as it has slowed down from the lunch rush. The food is still fresh and the staff are always friendly. I have even gotten the kids meal with a large ice tea and believe it or not, that fills me up as well plus its a little cheaper. All in all, its Panda Express. I mean what more can you ask for? Quick, cheap, done.",2
Service was good but the food was underwelming. They need to get rid of the word gourmet. nHad 2 stars but now that I am sick have to go with the minimum of 1 if there was an option for none I would rate it a zero. We will never be back. Avoid the micro burger only ate 1 4 of it because it was so discusting .,1
"It's not that good, the Lemon Chicken was tough and over cooked. Lemon sauce while it was on the side in the to go order didn't taste like lemon sauce. The shrimp fried rice was pretty plain and the shrimp was low quality and not very much. Good service and reasonable price, but not that good. Might try some noodles and maybe some veggie tofu items if I ever go back. I wish it was better.",1
"Fast and so goood! Got the chipotle chicken avocado. Yum! At around 7 for a hot sandwich, it was one of the best deals i've gotten in Vegas. The service was speedy and quick and they give you a pager to let you know when your sandwich is ready. Perfect if you want to walk away and grab a coffee at Peets coffee next to it.",2
"if you'd like to experience a true Las Vegas Buffet, don't go here. You have so much better options out there. I heard this place used to be famous for the seafood and that's why I decided to go but. not any more! king crab legs are skinny thin, no lobster tails and all the other foods are generally below average.",1
"This place is great! A friendly greeting as soon as I walk in, the sound and smell of freshly ground coffee, and of course the sweet sensation of bacon aroma! This place was reasonably priced for the deliciously yet plentiful servings. They informed me that the coffee was locally roasted and indeed freshly ground prior to brewing it. The homemade country gravy was astounding. I'll be back!",2
"This place has great sandwiches! The owner Joe is more than friendly and all about customer service. I had a problem with an order and he called me personally to deal with the issue. Today, when I went in everyone was very nice and they completed my order how Joe had noted. It was very smooth. Great customer service!",2
"I think I've found Boba heaven. One night I was seriously craving Boba and a friend recommended this place. The girl was really nice, I didn't have to wait longer than a minute, and she didn't have a problem giving me extra Boba. Did I mention they offer it in a 32 oz. cup? So many options, this place is great.",2
"I just stumbled across this place driving. When I walked in I was greeted with smiling, friendly people. They asked if this was my first time in, when I said yes they wanted me to sample everything they had. After many samples I came out with 4 items. Awesome FRESH Poke. This place is awesome! Definitely a must for the poke fan!",2
"Usually hit up the Amir in NDG, but decided to hit up this Amir as I was in the neighborhood and I was disappointed. Ordered the shish taouk platter, with rice hardly any chicken on my plate, garlic sauce was very acidic and tasted terrible, rice was made with cinnamon a lot of it and it was terrible! Would not go back to this location I'll stick to the one in NDG",1
"This used to be my favorite bar. Had scheduled to have my bachelorette party there. Even send out Evites to all my friends. All I did was smile and show my ""bride to be "" sash to the doorman. He rudely deemed my unfit to enter, even though 3 other where more than happy to help me and my party celebrate my special night.",1
The workers were friendly but full of excuses for delayed delivery of flooring. We really got the run around. Drove from Colorado to Vegas to put in a flooring that they said would be in when we arrived. Spent 2000 and our flooring was 3 days late and the transition moulding never arrived. We purchased this on advance to make a special trip to install. Very disappointing customer service.,1
"Fast, I can say that. Food is lack luster at best. Seems they just skip things that are listed on the menu. I ordered a California club wrap that came with Chester fries. Asiago cheese with truffle oil. Well, regular fries and a wrap that was missing three ingredients. When I ask, oh sorry we re out of those right now so we just served what we have.",1
"We tried every bao, and we loved them all! The duck was the best one. It was crispy and not too fatty.we had to order a second. Pork belly was the runner up. Even the tofu bao satisfied these two carnivores. If you appreciate fresh food and don't mind eating off a tv tray, then this place is for you! Think of it as an indoor food truck.",2
"We've been using the Desert Roots Farm CSA for over two years. During that time, our delivery has always been here when promised. The weekly share is abundant and includes all fresh, locally grown produce. In addition, it often includes something that I would not have purchased causing our family to expand its palatte. We love it!",2
"The best part of this place is the environment, the warmth, the friendly staff, and the cute little dishes they serve. I liked doing something different and tried Sangria for the first time as well. I like it! I think everyone should try this place. Get the roasted vegetables for sure. If you like brussel sprouts, theirs are wonderful!",2
"I drove 40 minutes from the other side of town to try this place on the strength of a positive review in Desert Companion. When I got there at 12 30, they were inexplicably closed. No sign, or indication they just randomly closed an hour and a half early for no reason. First rule of customer satisfaction be open when you say you will!",1
Lookout mountain is the best hiking workout. If you are just starting out you can hike the circumference around the mountain. nThe more advanced hikers can go straight up to the top and get a great view of downtown before a nice trail dowThe trails are wide and well kept for the most part. nAlmost never crowded and you can take your dog.,2
The food was so rich that apparently I got food poisoning! The guy who wrote the post saying he got food poisoning wasn't kidding because low and behold 30mins after my first bite I'm in pain in the bathroom. Thank god I got delivery or could u imagine the issue! I never update but I had to for this. Ugh great what a Friday night!,1
Best Panang I've had in Scottsdale so far! They are a little difficult to find if you haven't been there before but it's worth checking out. Their sushi isn't terrible but I don't come here specifically for sushi. I've taken many friends here and they all love it. it's definitely a step above a lot of the other thai restaurants in the area.,2
"Consistently the worst customer service that I come across of any whole foods, if it wasn't for such a good product I would never spend such an amazing amount of money per month with such consistently bad customer service, bad attitudes from employees and a place that takes 30 minutes to get a green smoothie.",1
"The food was okay.even the chips were cold! I drove out of my way to this location to eat the food and I was disappointed! It should have ""hit me in the head "" to think that maybe this restaurant would NOT have good Salvadorian food since they were serving ""Mexican "" style tortilla chips. Fresh Salvadorian hand made tortillas with butter or cheese would have been BETTER! Oh Well!",1
"I can't wait to go back! Everything we had was so yummy! I went to the Olive Mill on a Friday early in the afternoon with my mom, aunt and cousin. It was all so delicious. Our favorite thing was the butternut squash soup. The counter staff could have been a little more helpful but they weren't rude.",2
"Garcia's has been part of the Valley for decades. It always brings back good family memories. The food doesn't disappoint. I am so glad the moved in this area. This was their first week, they had a few opening glitches but they overcame. Good basic Mexican cuisine. This location is small, so check the wait time.",2
"Worst service of any fast food EVER. More like SLOW COLD FOOD or NO Food. it's what's worse employees tonight were rude, manager on duty spoke no English. Ridiculous. Thought I'd give this location one last try, even though I had another bad experience there this past Sunday when they CLOSED DOORS drive thru after I had been sitting in drive thru for literally 15 minutes.",1
"We had a great time eating at The Tavern! The wine selection is what we have all come to expect for Tarbell excellent. The food is excellent as well. We would highly recommend the tomato and goat cheese salad. The staff and crew were all fun, energetic and knowledgable. This place is highly recommended.",2
"Was at Mid Town Binks off 24th and Osborn Jan 1, 15 Thur Night. Great Attendant courteous attentive helping my wife and daughter had the car back before i handed the ticket. Unfortunately I didnt have a tip for him but he made me feel ok anyway. Wish he had a swipe type service. Im not always comfortable with Valet but really good service",2
Came here during Halloweeight. The restaurant was 1 4 occupied. This branch is cleaner and more spacious compared to the Rainbow Sahara branch. Food? That's questionable. I understand that it's cheap but the quality of food that you get is the same thing. The only one good dish here is the cubed beef with gravy. The rest is blah!,1
"So 1 hour before closing the chairs were already up and the soda machine was already off. I ordered a tuna sandwich and went back home. I have to say that this was the most disgusting sandwich I have ever had. The bread was stale and the tuna was so salty, I ended up drinking a gallon of water. I just threw the sandwich away.",1
"Our friends who were on vacation went, then demanded we join them the next night! It was great! The Tuna Tacos were bomb, the onion ring rack was unlike any I've ever eaten. Our server Luis was fun, friendly, and on point. The assistant mgr. stopped by to welcome us. Good atmosphere, amazing flavors, fair prices.it's a new must try. We will be back.soon!",2
Motel 6 is better. We checked in and went to our room that we reserved a week ago. .NO BED! Yes you read that correctly NO BED! My fiance'goes downstairs to get another room. . it's filthy. So after 3 1 2 hours we still don't have a room. I will never ever stay here again. NEVER! I don't recommend this place to anyone no even my dog. I can't give out a negative star unless I would.,1
"We arrived for our dinner reservation at 5pm, and the whole place was empty, Made our dinner a little bit awkward in such a large dining room to ourselves. The waiters were great and service good. The food was only alright. The steaks were really good, but I expected more for their prices. I could have eaten an equally delicious steak and asparagus somewhere else for half the price.",1
"Kudos to the manager for reaching out to make our next visit here better! The wings still rank high in my book, alongside the buffalo chicken dip! Our waitress was super helpful gave terrific service! Thanks for making our 2nd visit to Half Moon one which makes us want to return again in the future!",2
"I grabbed a burger tots from this location on 12 2 11 I typically don't eat ""fast food "" but I was in a bind. About 3am the following morning I was sick, I have spend the last 10 hours or so throwing up and cementing my ban on fast food. Customer beware, nothing feel worse than food poisoning. This is not just upset stomach, it is full on horrible.",1
"My husband ordered the sausage and peppers sandwich.When it came out it was very messy.Which was ok tasted pretty good.later that night he was so sick with stomach pains.Something was not right,maybe sausage not cooked enough?We probably won't be back.Saw other people leave with only half eaten pasta dishes.The pasta looked prettty blah.",1
"Ok, I KNOW how loyal traditional Madisoatives are.but, this was my third time here and I AM NOT IMPRESSED and won't go back.I have NO problem paying good money for good food, but for an OK steak and undercooked veggies not for me.I don't get why do many people live this place soo much?!? When the salad is the only good thing, I am and was disappointed.service was barely acceptable too.",1
would give negative stars. towed my car here from another incompetent mechanic. took them 2 months to even touch my car. parts were missing broken. car still not running in fact is in worse condition than it was before. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE. BUNCH OF LIARS. this situation started at Daves Automotive. check out my review of them for the entire story.,1
"Best place in Madison if you eat there once a month. Not so great if you eat there every day. Drinks are beyond amazing and priced beautifully in the Wisconsin fashion. Waitstaff is plentiful. Atmosphere is perfect. Everything has cheese in it, and I mean it. I will go there for the rest of my life.",2
"WOW! What a great experience. Not only is Dr. Llaca professional and easy to talk to, she has truly transformed my life. The headaches are gone and she has shown me some great stretches for me to do at home. Professionalism and patient care at its finest. nI have been, and will, continue to recommend her to everyone!",2
"Seriously the best pastrami downtown, and all of the valley as far as I'm concerned. Its a little pricey for lunch, but highly recommended if you want a real deli style sandwich. This place has been around for a long time, and while there are numerous and good sandwich options downtown, I think this joint is a step above just for the quality of the product.",2
"Overpriced Olive Garden unfortunately, the quality of the food is poor and the service is sub par. Veggies are frozen, not fresh this is a big downer on the pizzas and salads. The servers know nothing about the wine or the food for that matter. To give them a break, the place is brand new. I do not recommend this restaurant and predict it will close within 6 months.",1
"I took my truck in for an oil leak, and they found the leak and repaired it very quickly. The staff was very courteous and did not try to sell me on other services. I will definitely being going back there for all my future automotive needs. They are cheaper and by far less hassle for oil changes than jiffy lube.",2
"Romados has started doing delivery service and it's not amazing. I love their food I wish I could love their sauce, but it has gluten in it but Romados is really awful if it isn't fresh. My fries came cold with a lukewarm chicken carcass. Dry and inedible. Maybe you should stick to in store or figure out your takeout containers!",1
"I'm not sure about the previous reviewers comments on this place. I was there last weekend and had an amazing time. The music was fantastic, the people were good looking, and the atmosphere was super cool and chic. Maybe since I live in a big city I didn't notice the price aspect, but 8 for a strong drink is reasonable. Overall, had a fantastic time.",2
"I really liked staying at the Luxor until now. I recently stayed at the Luxor for two days and the room was dirty and it had beeeglected cosmetically. The walls had dents, the wallpaper was tearing apart, the rug was sticky and to top it off the Luxor pen they provided us with had a chewed cap which they didn't replace after we called it in.",1
We waited 45 minutes for our Oreo dessert and it came with melted ice cream and did not even compare to the deep fried Oreos you find at a county fair. The atmosphere is loud and un romantic. If you're into the club scene you will like this place better. The server was a very sweet girl who was very nice.,1
"Service is avg to below avg. they didn't bring our drinks until reminded. One of the order was wrong, which was promptly corrected. We asked for 1 mild and 1 hot entree. Both turned out very mild disappointing. We were mislead by prev reviews. Need to remind myself that most yelpers who review indian restaurant try the meat dishes, which could've better. Disappointed!",1
"This place is amazing! I've been a customer here for about 5 months and they have never steered me wrong. Cheap, efficient and dependable. I would suggest to anyone to drop your contracted mobile account and go straight to yes of course. Valerie is great and will help you out with anything you need!",2
"i went here last night, to see Kevin smith and Jason mewes, it was was great . very nice place. prices are a little high but it is downtown so that comes with going downtown. the staff was great they were flying around helping a sold out crowd. and i was right next to the stage so i had a great seat. i suggest this place to anyone.",2
"Terrible service, with an extreme patronizing attitude. nWent in to ask some questions about their artists, I got 4 tattoos at other places, so it's not like I was a newbie. I got extreme attitude, waited about 1 hour while the person at the person at the cash served every one else before me, I guess I don't look cool enough to be a client there. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!",1
"This is definitely the best mall in AZ it is actually the nicest mall I have ever been too. The mall is very well kept, it has great stores, you don't have to pay for parking, a wonderful play area and employees are all friendly and helpful. The only gripe I have is their elevators are too small for mommies with strollers and toddlers in tow.",2
"Affordable dining on the strip, especially for the Palazzo hotel. We were surprised at how big and cheap the meals were. Service is good our waiter one night was David T. and he was as good as they come . Great for big groups, they'll get you in out real quick so you can get back to losing your money in the casino!",2
"Stopped out to Stage Door the other night, and had a blast! nService was outstanding, enough to earn an additional star. nBrittany, the bar tender we had, is awesome. Every time I've been in and she's been working, she's smiling. I don't think I've ever not seen her smile. 4 shots of patron? YES PLEASE. The glass was salted, with a lime. Delicious! Great Job Stage Door! ",2
"I could not be happier with my experience with Presidential Limo. From the booking process, which I did over the phone, to the email confirmation, to the pick up at the airport and back to the notification of dispatching. Both drivers we had were professional, personable and helpful. I will definitely be using them again when I return to Vegas!",2
Went in to get an exam. Location looks great and Dr. Chang was awesome. Went back to order some glasses and Megan was great. I've never had to get classes so I didn't know what to do but she was very helpful and took the time to answer my dumb questions. I will absolutely recommend this location to my friends.,2
"Pretty damn good. Drove by and saw this place so decided to try it out. n Prices are reasonable and offered traditional Mediterranean meals that tasted amazing. this should expand and overtake the larger chains that are crap. The food did take a while to come out but there was about 8 people in line in front and considering the small operation and made to order food, I understand.",2
"1st time trying Ramen, and it was disgusting. It's rare I push the plate away after one bite but I couldn't stomach a second. Obviously I won't fault this place for my disliking. The appetizers were really good actually fried green beans, tempura shrimp, and a soy covered edemame. I won't be back but glad I tried the tried.",2
I eat at Chipotle often. 3 5 times a week due to my busy schedule i find chipotle to be on the healthier side of fast food. At this particular one the service is horrible. They are super stingy when it comes to meat and ingridients. I have to ask them to put more chicken or more steak everytime. I dont except to pay 10 dollars for a bowl of rice and beans.,1
"This is a great dog park. There's a lot of room for them to go nuts! However, that in itself being great is also one of it's downfalls. I feel like I have to follow my dog everywhere to make sure he's not leaving surprises or having issues with other dogs. So I can't really relax here, but it is beautiful.",2
"Went here for my birthday and had a blast! No VIP red carpet BS you'd put up with at snooty clubs. Good mixed crowd, no drama, great music! Only reason I won't give it five stars is because it was hotter than fire and brimstone in there and security made me put my hand fan away! WTF?! Other than that it was fantastic!",2
AMAZING! That about sums it all up. nAWESOME service from every staff member. Authentic sweet tea my sister from tennessee gave the approval! . Love the mason jars for the drinks. and the food.wow. I never knew Fried chicken and waffles could be so amazing. nI'm in love. This was my second time there and i will most definitely be back!,2
First time in charlotte and found this place. I had the lobster mac n cheese. It was good and just good. The waitress was nice and helpful and recommended a few places to find souvenirs and other brews since I am not from north carolina. The corn was very juicy and buttery. Boyfriend got the beer there and he loved it.,2
"I'm slightly confused at the high ratings. JJ isn't bad. But everyone raving about the bread? It's average. Yes, delivery is crazy fast, and they are better than other huge chains, but is that our standard now? Better than the worst? I'd rather go to a local joint, that is not being sued for wage theft and accused of making its employees even drivers sign unprecedented non compete clauses.",1
"The pizza from this location is consistent and predictable. Probably not going to win any gourmet prizes, but it is hot, tasty and delivered timely. I don't know who is looking for more toppings we've never noticed that to be a problem at this store. The price is very fair and who couldn't love the website? So much better than phoning it in.",2
"Due to its proximity to work, I've given this place a few goes, each time was awful. The staff is lazy and don't seem to want to be there. The food is awful for the price, drop everything 2 3 then it might be worth it. The pizza is far far undercooked and looks nothing like the picture, warning, stay away.",1
If you're not familiar with New Mexican food be warned it is pretty darn hot! Its very good at La Ristra though and somewhat more high brow than some I've tried. The portions are a little large for me partly because I drink a gallon of tea to douse the heat. Its a little expensive in my opinion but the service makes it worth the extra few dollars.,2
"Magnificent! If you are looking for a butcher then this is an excellent place to go to! A large assortment of meats to pick up here. I came for Duck, it was perfect.HUGE too.and reasonably priced. My only concern is that it closes kinda early. Really nice people too. If I moved to the Montreal area, I would be here ALL the time!",2
"WAY OVERPRICED! we paid 69.00 for 2 people and it wasn't even all you can eat! No lettuce, radish or rice wraps were served. Food was good quality but its hard to mess that up! I've had Korean BBQ 1000 better for 17 per person. This was 35 per person. I will never go again. Someone posted I should ask for the ""Local "" Menu. You should never have to ask for the local menu.",1
"Food is mediocre and prices are too high for what felt more like a sampler than a dish. 31 for three sliders in a small plate is ridiculous as was a piece of chicken for 42. nAlso, they don't serve bread which doesn't seem very welcoming while you seat there waiting for your food to arrive. Don't mind paying for great food, but this was an expensive bad meal, with a small menu badly executed.",1
"I shared a large Signature Spinach pizza with 3 friends, we were pretty satisfied with the pizza. We tend to be pretty picky and fussy about our pizza becuase were all from NYC and NJ. the crust was a little doughy i prefer it to be more crispy. The flavors from the spinach and garlic really stand out and make for a very tasty pizza. I will definitely be ordering from here again!",2
" ""Gordon Biersch Swillery Franchise "" There, fixed it for them. These people need to be hit in the nuts with empty bottles of Anchor Steam and about the neck and chest with full bottles of Shiner Bock. Take your restaurant concept to Chandler and bug out of the best piece of real estate on Mill Ave.",1
"I had the Ahi Salad and it was Delicious. Big fan! I also had the strawberry shortcake and it was also amazing. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and they had a little ""outdoor' patio area to eat on. Of course, since it was inside with the forum shops in Caesar's Palace, it was still inside. Good food!",2
"Yum! Went here last night after finding a groupon and seeing all the great reviews on yelp. So good! We ordered the crispy spicy eggplant, orange ""chicken "" and hot and sour soup. Everything was amazing and the crispy spicy eggplant is a must have! Service was excellent and food came out quickly. We will be making this a regular place for us.",2
"I was very, very disappointed in this place. The food is way overpriced for the quality. We ordered the burgers and they were dry barely edible. Our waitress was also terrible. Slow and inattentive. If I go to a fine dining restaurant, I want expect great, great food and attentive service. I absolutely did NOT get that here. Don't waste your money. Go to the Melting Pot instead. Awful.",1
"The interior is pretty extravagant, considering how cheap the dishes are. I ordered the chicken drunkeoodles pad kee mao , and did not enjoy it very much. It just tasted like a bland blend of salty sauces with a barely existent tinge of basil. The menu was very diverse with Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese foods, which probably explains why the drunkeoodles did not taste Thai at all.",1
"Don't even hesitate about going here. Stop reading reviews and go! Great beers, REALLY good food. Try their wings if you like them I always loved the Spicy Thai. I moved away from AZ unfortunately, but this is one of those places that I miss and will have to stop in every single time I come back. Go and have one of their beers for me Hop Knot or the Hefeweizen were my favorites.",2
"Leaves much to be desired. Overpriced. Better Jamaican food in the valley! After getting reheated stake red beans and rice brought it to the owners attention, he did nothing about it and had the audacity to charge me for the meal. This restaurant may be good for folks who don't really know authentic West Indian cuisine.",1
"I had to review this place again. I normally get fries and the cilantro rice as my sides, but tonight I decided to change it up a bit. After reading great reviews on the green beans and plantains, I decided to give both a try and glad I did. I can't really say anything negative about this place. Everything here is pretty amazing!",2
"The 3 wonderfully written reviews before me pretty much sums it up, thanks Jade and David for organizing this event. I had never heard about this organization prior to Yelp Helps, I'm glad I was able to help and definitely want to come back to sort some more. What a great way to volunteer, I've been spreading the word so more people are aware of this Org and hope to get more volunteers.",2
"Just following up from my post 7mo ago. After they told me I had 10 cavities being a patient there for 4yrs and Invisalign there I went elsewhere. No cavities! Now on my following 6mo appt at my New dentist, guess what. Still no cavities! These people called me today to actually schedule an appt for a cleaning because its been over a year. I wonder why. Never ever going there again.",1
"Pita Jungle has become a hit on so many levels after a movie, Happy Hour, reverse HH. Their chicken dishes are absolutely great. But, the real hit is their felafel's. We have also used their catering and it too was superb. We had a group of 75 to feed, we chose the chicken dishes and the group was blow away and we had extra to spare. Enjoy!",2
"I'm so glad to have this theater in my neighborhood. Great variety of films, great atmosphere, and very reasonable prices.I like that they often have a 5 30 PM movie which I can catch right after work and still be home by a reasonable hour, because I am an old persoow. And yet, they still let me in, even though I am old and creaky 40 and not young, hip, or hot.",2
"Love this resort. It's about as as nice a location as you can get in the Phoenix metro area. Visited the resort and had massages and manicures at the Joya spa. Wow, what a great way to spend the afternoon. If you go make sure to spend some time at the pool area the views are amazing and so relaxing.",2
"don't come to the hard rock during the week. the room was t any less and most things were closed., like the pools, the club, the juice bar, ect. nalso they charge you this bogus ""resort fee "" that includes wifi, which I was never able to get, shuttle service which we never used maybe we should have to get to another hotel ! Very disappointed. will not come back here.",1
"My son had a bad experience here. He was 4 when he started. He liked it at first, but then he didn't want to go and would cry if I took him. He couldn't understand what the master was saying to him and the master would clearly get frustrated with him. When my son didn't want to go back, they still tried to withdraw money from my account for months. The communication is horrible.",1
"Love this studio! They offer so many different classes daily and their instructors are awesome. I love Greg's hot yoga class, he is always so helpful and funny too, he definitely loves what he does. At the end of his class, he puts a cold peppermint towel on your head! They also have a great groupon deal for those that want to check it out before joining.",2
"I was not a fan of their food. Overpriced for the quality, which was so so. We got the garlic edamame and sushi rolls. The sushi was not impressive. The alcoholic beverages were also so so, I even ordered liquor in my drink that was not house. I would recommend finding another place if you are a sushi lover, it may be better for people who want non sushi.",1
It seems like Hogs Heaven does not care about getting any business at all. First they closed for at least three months last fall and then they're supposedly open again. I was actually raving about this place and wanted to eat lunch with my girlfriend only to see that they're closed.again! What gives?!,1
"I purchased tickets weeks before a show, upon arrival I was turned away for over capacity. LOUSY and unprofessional. This has never happened at any other small venue and I have been to plenty. This was a reminder for me to see my bands at another venue. It wasn't worth the planning and time it took to make sure I arrived for the show I paid for and didn't even get to see them.",1
Super crowded! The concept of top golf is really cool. It kinda reminds me of bowling but has way way more people there. There's people everywhere waiting to play this driving range game. I went for the first time on a Saturday evening. I don't suggest that time especially if it's your first time and your excited to check it out.,1
"I blame snooze for making every meal I ate after theirs seem ho hum. The flavor of the meal was amazing as was the service, thanks for a great meal. I had the Benny goodman and a traditional eggs Benedict. We are going to bookend our trip with another bite from the ""snooze "" before flying back to Sitka, Alaska.",2
"Dave is an amazing person who will do well at whatever he does, but I am afraid he stood us up this morning and when we contacted him to find out where he was, he told my husband that he is really no longer in the sprinkler business. This makes me very, very sad! I loved him and I adored working with him.",1
"I don't understand why people eat here. The food is greasy, the restaurant store bakery smells, and you get that smell with you in your clothes. I went over a week ago with some coworkers as an ""appreciation "" meal, thanks but no thanks. I am from Mexico, and even the street restaurants are better than this.",1
"I was not impressed by this restaurant at all. The flooring is all carpeting and it is disgusting. Please vacuum and deep clean it. Even better just replace that nasty floor. The menu was dirty and sticky. Just clean the restaurant! The rolls were nothing to brag about, just average food. Even the roll presentation was bad. We will not be returning.",1
"Wow I'm really surprised that this place got as many good ratings as it has. I had a single cheese burger which was really bad. The patty was thin, over cooked, and the cheese was not melted. The fries were fair but I think they were frozen prior. There were not many people in the place at lunch time as well. I would be surprised if this place is still around in 6 months.",1
"Staff was friendly enough 1star smoothies were ok 1star . Forgot our smoothies literally 20 min later. As one guy goes on break busy flirting with the girlfriend that came in the other tells another customer they are slow. I stand there and he goes ""are you waiting for something? "" . I reply ""yes our smoothies "" I had to tell him what I ordered and wait all over again.",1
"The view is amazing, and that's where it ends. nThe selection of sushi really disappointed my girlfriend and I, so we decided to try two of the signature rolls and one old favorite. All of it was bland, over priced, and just really not worth the time and effort to go there. nThe only other upside besides the view was the house Sake was pretty decent. Other than that, spend your money elsewhere.",1
"When we moved to Vegas two years ago, this was our go to place. Over the last few months, the place has changed ownership and the quality has gone to shit! The only waitress worth anything is Ellen, always has been. The new owner is an asshat! He was extremely rude and has absolutely zero business skills. Sadly, the quality of the food has also declined. I don't think we'll ever be back again!",1
"I've gotta admit, of all the fried chicken fast food places, I like this chain the best. The service was great, and the food is better than Popeye's, Church's, or KFC all in Houston . The fried chicken has a great crunch and flavor the french fries are delicious with its unique seasoning. Every time I go to NC and I need a quick meal, Bojangles is the place!",2
"Went in there to redeem my coupons for the BOGO free smoothie. When I asked the worker whats all in strawberry banana smoothie his response was a simple ""uhh strawberries and bananas dude. "" Everyone who works in here is your typical gym rat and will give you the stink eye if you don't lift as much as them. Poor customer service, decent at best smoothies.",1
"Our family loves this place. Super clean, really good food especially the burgers and totally kid friendly. They are so nice here and love the neighborhood charm. It's like the bar that always knows your name and when if they don't, they make you feel so welcomed. Check out this local place. Really good food!",2
"Great breakfast spot. There are known for their specialty bloody marys which I had to help with my hangover. I ordered the chorizo hash and it was tasty, large amount, and left me very full. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I had a bite of the chicken and that was amazing as well. Highly recommended for breakfast when in Vegas.",2
"This is the Cheers of my hood. Go a few times a month to grab a cocktail or two. Love all the bartenders and the people that go there on a regular. It is a bar so duh it smells like smoke. They just re opened the kitchen and when I heard they had 10 pizzas I thought I would give it a try. Delicious! Sauce, crust and cheese were very tasty and you can't beat that price for that quality.",2
Not impressed. My wife and I have been here a few times for happy hour. Today my mini burgers were not seasoned at all. The fry portion was for a child. My wife bit into her pad thai and spit it out immediately. Went to alert management that they were serving inferior product. He could not be bothered. We asked for our money back and will not be visiting again.,1
"I hadn't been to Lux since they expanded. I have always loved the coffee and the pastries but my favorite has always been the quiche. I went in today in the afternoon and was very pleasantly surprised that the atmosphere hasn't changed, it just has so much more room. I didn't get a chance to try food today but was very happy with my soy latte with the beautiful art in the foam.",2
I stayed at the Cosmopolitan and I hit up this place 2 of the 3 nights I was in Vegas. My only regret is not going 3 for 3. The pizza here is sooooo good! I tried a classic slice of pepperoni and a slice of the pepperoni sausage. The pepperoni sausage is the winner here. Avoid this place past 2 am on Saturday night or you'll be in a long line with ratchets and haters.,2
"TINY PORTIONS! I could not believe how small the portions are in this place. I mean literally 2 tablespoons of lamb, two tablespoons of salad and a cup of rice. What is this, France? I had to go somewhere else afterward just to feel full. nThe food was good, but come on, I don't need a child's plate! From now on I'll stick with Flaming Kabob on Baseline in Gilbert.",1
"Fresh, high quality, locally sourced seafood. The fish is incredibly fresh and cut to order. When I walked in the other day, they were filleting a whole red snapper right there in store. You don't see that at the Harris Teeter! Between the high quality, fresh seafood and the great customer service, this place cannot be beat.",2
"This Red Robin is sad and old. The place feels a little dirty and like it's time for a facelift. My waitress was very nice and I received fast service. nThe food is the big problem at this location. The fries tasted like the oil had gone rancid and the water tastes like it came out of the toilet. Everything was tainted by the bad flavors. Sorry Red Robin, normally you are a good standby lunch.",1
"Loved everything about the tacos, especially the sweet pulled pork. Fresh handmade tortillas also taste delectable. If I had any drawbacks it would be that they are sort of stingy with toppings sauces. Otherwise you are best advised to come here on Taco Tuesdays for 1.50 tacos and buy a lot of them! Sweet pulled pork is out of this world!",2
I love this place. They are very nice and very helpful. They make themselves available to accommodate the customer and don't quibble about inconsequential things I was late picking my dogs up and they didn't fuss or charge me extra . I am moving and they even took time out to dig around for boxes for me. Good people who make our big city feel cozy.,2
"The store was well laid out and nice, definitely a classy feel. Although the store itself was nice, I was not impressed with their products. Most all of the bras were black, tan or white, and most of the sleepwear was cute but nothing too sexy. I wasn't looking for anything scandalous, but I guess I was looking for lingerie that was a little more fun.",1
"Jay's is 2 Legit 2 Quit. nThe philly cheese steak is legit with fresh mushrooms, onions and green peppers. Savory and delicious. nJay's is always has a clean dining room and their staff is friendly. nIf dig a good kebab you can head over to Jay's after spring training and eat like the Avengers. nJay's you are one classy establishment. Thanks for having me!",2
Went into Wahoo s Friday April 26 2013 It was crowded as usual However service is terrible They have gotten rid of all servers in the bar area you have to go to the bar to order everything they have changed the pork sliders not as good I don t know why things needed to be changed mayb e to save money on overhead terrible choice from management,2
"Was completely mislead by website on suggested trailer for my home. Went with suggested trailer only to later find out, only 13ft of that trailer was in the quote. 800 additional charge after the fact does not sit well with me and I will never use or recommend them to anyone ever again. Also the danger of a 300lb detached ramp is an accident waiting to happen.",1
" 50 to get in.the inside part of the club is insane.hardly able to move.went outside.exact same as surrender.but we didn't have a table.drinks weren't as expensive as I thought they would be though. This place is a clubbers dream. Lots of girls stand ankle high in the shallow pool, so it's hard to get to them. Didn't get to see someone fall into the water, so that sucked.",2
I was really excited to try to this restaurant because of the reputation it had. Bobby Flay.you pretentious bastard! Stop putting chipotle and cilantro on everything. What's sad is that the buffet had tastier meats than this overrated place. Poor people who freakin wait the 2 hr lines just to get a mediocre steak priced at 60 with no sides. Best part of this place was the exit.,1
"This place is cheap and good. 6.50 , tax included, for a veal sausage ciabatta, latte and a side of risotto. n nThis place is ridiculously small, they do make coffee, but it's not the kind of place where you can lounge for hours. The only drawback is they seem to run out of lots of stuff, so no selection when i went there.",2
"For a pizza place this place can't bake them right. We put the 2 3 limit topping and easy sauce, but for some reason they are all came out soggy in the middle. Like it wasn't cooked right. I think they need more practice on the right temp and cooking time nOh and their gluten free crust is so cardboard. Stick to Pieology!",1
"Meh. Sports bar. Worse, a sports bar chain. The outdoor patio was more attracitve, even if was part of the mall's covered car park. I don't tolerate the smell of stale beer. That's what greeted me at the inside podium. There's bar food on the menu, of course. Fried next to more fried stuff. Come here after work and throw down some beers. That would be fun.",1
"A fun place to go with a group or a date! Be sure to order something flaming cause that's a real treat. The food is great, I love the gyro platter, and the gyro salad. The portions are surprising, since if you get a large salad you would be amazed and their idea of ""large "". The deserts are okay, but I haven't had many of them since by the time it comes around I am ready to be rolled out the door.",2
"Did not stay here.just commenting about the public areas. It looks like a decent place to hang out except for the perfumy STENCH when you walk in. They pump a nauseating, sickly sweet cloying ""fragrance "" into the casino and lobby that made me and my boyfriend want to get out as quickly as we could. I want to rename this place the POLLUTEZZO!",1
"Favorite spot for high quality food during the lunch rush. These guys treat customers like family and take care of all the details to make sure your food is perfect and you enjoy your meal. I'm very impressed with the new management. This is good food, fast, that is a huge leap above ""fast food "". Love it!",2
"Fun decor. Good food. Lovely cocktail though I agree it was weird they didn't list ingredients in the descriptions . The servers were very accommodating. My only real issue was the price. The servings were small, especially the rice. I felt like we ordered quite a bit of food but still weren't satiated.",2
I didn't stay here so I'm just reviewing the casino itself. This place is super strange. The sports betting area is horribly outdated. There are old style monitors everywhere. It looked like the control room although a lot less cool from Apollo 13. The place is caught in a time warp and has not been updated. Nor does it seem to be maintained much at all.,1
"Went here for a Spring Training game on Saturday, not one complaint! Parking was only 5 dollars, we got great seats for only 20 a piece. Everything was clean, the food was great. Next time maybe I'll venture further than a hot dog, but it was a great hot dog at that! Washing it down with a nice cool budweiser on a spring afternoon, it doesn't get much better than this.",2
"It was open late, and it served dessert. And the lady working behind the counter was friendly. The cupcakes were only eh we had three tiny bites the best of which was chocolate and a cupcake to share the strawberry red one. I wasn't impressed, and it was priced a bit much. Apparently the corridor is getting redone, but the place was still cute and near a walkway to see people passing by.",1
My first time here and it was great ! Ben is super nice . Always making sure the girls understood what you want . And a big surprise shock was they put sunblock on my hands before the went in the light . A nice touch ! I forgot the girls name who did my nails but she was a lot of fun to talk with . All in all further away from me but worth the trip for sure !,2
"Came in today for VIP wash. It was just ok. Outside of car is fine. Inside I have a grease stain on passenger seat, the console , stick shift area us all dusty still and the door panels are dusty still. It all should have been clean as part of VIP . Not impressed. But I didn't notice till after I drove off and they closed at 6.",1
I love coming here. The food is always good and the beer is always cold but. I have to agree with Lyn B. The wait staff is horrible. The girls look irritated when they wait on you and it takes them forever to come over to take your drink order and food order. I used to be a waitress and there is no excuse for bad service.,2
"The coffee was delicious, served in a mug, NOT a paper cup, like one of the other reviewers complained. No city is a real city unless it has an independently owned low budget greasy spoon diner like this place. You can have your Perkins, your Denny's, your Pannekukin, Starbucks, McDonald's, or whatever chain you call it, but, for me, a breakfast at one of these diners is the real deal!",2
"oh man! I'm addicted to this place like crack cocaine! PLEASE NOTE I'VE NEVER TRIED DRUGS TO INCLUDE CRACK COCAINE BUT I CAN IMAGINE HOW AN ADDICTION WORKS BECUASE I'VE GOT ONE FOR THIS PLACE. Apple fritter warmed up, ham chees croissant complimented with jalapeno's a Thai Tea! Of course the other doughnuts are delish but you gotta pimp your Fav's am I right people.",2
1 star only cause i had to i would not recommend anyone here the office staff is unprofessional uneducated nasty bitches that are rude as shit. they will take your money and send you straight to collections with out notice or contacting you first! DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT USE THEM AS YOUR 3RD PARTY BAIL ALADDIN BAIL BONDS ARE CLEAN NICE AND PROFESSIONAL!,1
First they charged me twice for bottle service and today they bring me a small bottle of Patron for 3 bills. this place is starting to remind me of TJ with all the hustle. When I come to Vegas and randomly got to a lounge that's half full and get bottle service I expect not to be hustled like I'm a tourist.,1
"Slooooooow, sloooooooow, slooooooooow! nRestaurant full of empty tables, yet, it took 10 minutes to be seated? Once seated, my poor coffee cup was yearning to be filled. That took almost 10 minutes. About 5 minutes after that, my order was finally taken. I won't even tell how long it was for my food to land in front of me. I guess I'm just used to diners in the Northeast?",1
"My new go to source for all things hair! I wouldn't trust anyone but Rick with my hair! Rick Patrick over exceeds my expectations! Last time not only did he fit me in last min. and stay late starting at 5pm at Sat. night! , he made me look stunning! Now I can hit the beaches of Hawaii in style! If you're looking for a salon or stylist who you can really trust go to R Salon. They are the best!",2
"This is a great place to go. May not be the typical food to eat in Montreal but hey who cares. They have great food and great BEER. The staff is friendly and speak English. Bonus for a guy like me who has a hard time with the English language, don't think I can ever learn another language. nCome check this place out. You'll like it.",2
"Awesome sushi and great experience. Came here for my birthday with friends. We sat at the sushi bar and Kasper was the best. He was very friendly and explained anything I asked. My food was amazing. Service from Kasper was great. Took a while to get drinks, but overall awesome. We will return for sure!",2
"As previous reviews have mentioned, this place has a very laid back a la Caribbean feel, as it should. The jerk chicken pork meal was large and very satisfying. The flavors were subtle, yet kept you interested in the meal. I loved that they had some Jamaican products you can purchase right there and home made hot sauce served with the food was amazing! Will definitely go back when in Madison!",2
This place is the spot for lunch! I mean come on. Its Indian food buffet style! What's not to like about that. They serve you garlic naan or plaiaan also buffet all you can eat . The have all the standard fare as well as basmati rice. I always eat about a metric ton of food and when I get the bill. That's right 10. Starbucks costs more than that! Definitely try this place out.,2
"This Fry's is just around the corner from my home. Unless I'm taking my husband's grandma shopping who also lives right around the corner here, I avoid this place at all possible! I much rather drive a couple miles to another Fry's. What really turns me off is the clientele and it just feels. dirty.",1
"This is a solid sushi spot.it's only 25 26 bucks for AYCE! Gotta love that. The decor is okay, the service is average to slightly above average and the fish is a 7 or 8 out of 10. This place isn't going to blow your mind, but it is a solid place to grab dinner on a random night. My friend works here, so I typically come up here for a beer and a poke bowl. or some sushi.",2
"We've stopped in for a late lunch twice in the past two weeks. Service has been consistently good. The place is spotless as well. The food is great! Only complaint, if it is one at all, is there's too much food. Both times we've taken food home. Nice problem to have. This is an unpretentious, comfortable place with really good food. If you're anywhere near, stop in you won't be disappointed.",2
"Ok. so this is real chinese food, but I'm not in china and I like the americanized version. Had a large group and PF has big tables. Was really good food, good prices feed 12 for less than 250. Nice crowd. although there was a guy at the table next to us with a ""Pimp "" cup. a big crazy jewel encrusted grail? Couldn'd understand why? but hey.",2
"I visited Lux for the first time with a friend for coffee and breakfast. The atmosphere was great! The place has hipster vibe as well. It is also has plenty of space to sit inside and outside. The coffee was everything coffee should be. I ate a blackberry orange scone delicious! There's much more to be explored about this place, so I will definitely be back to try out some other things!",2
"GOOD FOOD. GOOD PRICE. NICE LADY. Pho is great. Let me tell you, I am a PHOnatic and Saigon Kitchen has some great pho. The broth is very good and cleanses my soul haha. nChicken Fried Rice is also good. Spring rolls were on point, Haven't tried anything else yet, but I will soon. Nice lady, too friendly.",2
Called and placed my order. Was told told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived 10 mins after I called and waited 20 more mins. People came in after me were seated and got there food. When I finally received my food and took it home it was cold. Never going here again. And not to mention the friend wonton was fried so hard I could barely eat and. And nothing was inside of them .,1
"Avoid at all costs. Awful service, slow as hell, only uses disposable plasticware plates to add landfill insult to heinous food. Despite telling them we were in a rush to catch a plane and multiple reassurances that the food would arrive in plenty of time, they lollygagged around and I ended up paying 30 to be seriously pissed off and hungry with no food. BLECH.",1
"They have great pairs of shoes at discounted prices. They also have different apparel for cheap as well although its not consistent. However, if you are ever in the area you might experience the WOW FACTOR like I did when I scored two shirts for 20. If you love NIKE and need a fix then Nike Factory Store is as good as it gets !",2
STAY AWAY! Horrible service. The old man cussed in front of my 5 year old after I had my husband's watch in the store to have a link removed and when I picked it up the pin was gone and the watch would not work. I was told it would be 30 minutes and still not ready after an hour. Will never go near the store again.,1
I was skeptic since I have had bad experiences going new places and trying a new person but I was more than pleased! The front desk was absolutely sweet! Jazmen was knowledgeable and helped me out with tips on how to use the products. I saw Ashley who is AMAZING! She's quick and precise! def would recommend !,2
"I've been to this place a few times now and have to rave abt how awesome it is! I have 3 fave things cheeseburger flatbread, chicken and waffles, and the diablos. I've tried several things on the menu and have yet to come across something I don't like. Only one complain THOSE LITTLE ROUND STOOLS ARE NOT COMFY! I always request a stool with a back on it, that helps.",2
"If your devices arent working as they should, this is the place to go! I was referred here by a friend and they didnt disappoint. The staff was friendly and the service was fast and reasonably priced! Ask for Robby! He has done a good job on a few of my devices and I will definitely go back for any needs.",2
Come here quite frequently since it is so close to both work and my house. I've never really had anything besides beer and whiskey and both were great. The food looks pretty great. I have yet to try it. The Irish pub theme is great. Last time I went they had a guy performing live music so that was great!,2
"Helpful and friendly staff. No wait, even on a Saturday! Only negative I have to say is that the vet wanted to do X rays on our dog after we talked to her but she didn't even touch him or look at him first. X rays cost 182 incase anyone needs them and then she gave us pain meds for our pup and said she'll let is know about X rays later. Just didn't seem to care much.",2
"If you want to get the squirts, order their frittata which sucked BTW bland, very little pesto sauce, veggies, hidden by a mound of bitter greens. I couldn't tell if I was eating a salad on an omelette or the other way around . The cafe latte was good, but small for a 'regular' sized coffee. I was hoping to have a filling breakfast, butt, in the next several hours, everything came back out.",1
"This place sold me two used table lamps. when i opened them one was defective and the other had missing parts. my guess is that they were return products that the store never bothered checking or worst yet, thought they could turn around and sell back to customers . I returned the lamps and will never step foot into this store again.",1
CPK is my favorite place for the past 25 years! nThe menu is missing a lot of items! As for the wait. There were clean tables available and they still made us wait.not very happy with our experience here. We eat twice a week at CPK but will not come back to this one! I gave them 2 stars for the decor!,1
"Bucks is my favorite pizza place in town. To like Bucks you must like Racine style pizza thiiiiinnnnn crust and cheap . I like that Bucks dosent waste their money oiceties like pizza boxes, delivery, or operating out of somewhere other than an old defunct car wash. they focus on their pizza instead, and they do pizza very well.",2
"Came here this past Veterans Day weekend. The womaeeded her Asian food fix. I don't know why she likes coming here especially when she is used to having good Asian cuisine. Had the duck, a noodle dish, and a waiter recommended crab noodle dish. Just okay for all of it and I've definitely had better.",1
"I did not like their food at all. Had one dish, sent it back, the second plate was just as horrible. Not close to authentic Mexican food at all. The atmosphere is very nice though. The authentic music made the atmosphere even better! Haven't gone back since I went the first time. Go at your own risk!",1
"We got Christmas dinner here for an excellent price the mashed potatoes were delicious, the cranberry whatever was very good, turkey eminently serviceable and allowed me to make my own gravy. Why are commercially prepared gravies always so horrid? Otherwise, I've taken to getting their whole beans as an 'offprice' alternative to the micro roasters around town.",2
"I'll give a two on five, just because of the local craft beers list. I mean when they got all the range full, not 20 on 30. Unfortunately, vice and versa got two huge issues n a non welcoming staff, who seems to be tired of serving you or answering your questions n the very poor knowledge in beer, which for a craft beer pub is sad. Anyway, French fries are really good.",1
"Delicious sandwiches! Go for the Pastrami Reuben! That one is absolutely the best one of the ones we tried and we ate here twice in two days! Cheap and quick meal and very convenient if you are staying in the Venezia Tower. Go here for those in between meals and snacks between gambling, clubbing and eating at the fancier spots!",2
"Girlfriend and I took the wrong turn for Sonoran hotdogs and suddenly ended up in sushinola. Best decision ever! Heard from friends of this unknown delicacy and wanted to try as I am food enthusiast. Food was great, offered 4 different types of dipping sauces with prompt service. Would recommend the bomboza and chinola as it had such a distinct flavor. Will try this place again for sure!",2
"OK, So I got a deal for this on tipsydevil a few months ago. I was planning on going with a big group of guys and making a night out of it. Well, lo and behold, the owner of this place decides to cancel all the deals, screwing over not only tipsydevil, but also all of us future ""customers. "" I guess the manager got too greedy for his own good. Oh well, off to Cheetah's instead.",1
"Are you guys hiring for managers? B c you need one. Sign said seat yourself many tables weren't bussed waitstaff not around much food marginal. Drinks were OK. Waiter was pleasant, but we had to ask another one to find him to get our check. This is the second time I've been to this location service was poor the first time but the food was better. Prob won't come back!",1
Food was somewhat good lots to choose from but a friend of mine had a problem with her food and asked to have something done about it. the manager on duty wasn't will to give any comps or refunds.liked this as a first time but the service for my friend has pretty much destroyed any chance of us coming back or recommending to others.,1
"As far as bingo goes lol I am a noob. Although I did play bingo in elementary school this is nothing like it. It is fast paced and you usually play more than one card. It's really fun tho so if you have never done it, I recommend you check it out. It's a great hangout with friends my friends and I go almost every week. Not to this one every time but occasionally. ",2
"Despite being nearly empty, the service was incredibly slow. Ok, so maybe we just got the one bad waitress. But the food was really overpriced and not that great. I ended up sending my meal back, something which I haven't done in years. There's better food for half the price elsewhere. We won't be going back.",1
"I love The Farm At South Mountain. It's kind of far from me, but definitely worth the drive. There's a plethora of things to do here, restaurants, small shops, great food and breath taking views of agrarian life in the city and South Mountain make this place a must! I've had some of the freshest and tastiest vegetables here, and I go all the time.",2
Absolutely a joke. The chicken they serve seem to be half servings. Mac n cheese is always cold along with the mashed potatoes. If they happen to serve hot it's over heated n over cooked. The service is terrible. When u ask for something additional they sigh and act like you're such an inconvenience. Wish there was a better one close to my work.,1
"It's a show and a club and a wonderland of music and awkwardness. Definitely a must see if you want some randomness in your life or you want to be entertained by sexy meets circus performers. Music is GREAT. Free drinks before midnight, bottle service tables in stadium seats overlooking the stage, which turns into a dancefloor!",2
"Hi I'm Cuban and went here mid week last year. My husband wanted to treat me to my favorite food. Sorry, this was not only a major disappointment but the place is an old Pizza Hut with dirty walls and questionable food. Did not enjoy this experience at all. We need good Cuban food in Phoenix. Until then, I will be heading to NYC or Miami. Nice try.",1
"Just got back from the Sunday jazz brunch Every Sunday nBrunch nBuffet n 20 per persoLive jazz music SCORE! I thought the food was fantastic! Not bellagio great, but definitely tasty and well worth the 20 I had prime rib, paella, shrimp, a custom omelet, kahlua french toast. pastries. chocolate dipped strawberries. yummmmmmmmmmm So yes, I shall return. Love it.",2
"I'm not a vegan, but this place is pretty top notch. Fresh ingredients, excellent plating, and fantastic execution. I got the highly recommended fire veggie burger which was delicious! I would try it with lettuce wrap next time. My friend got the living burrito and this was even better. Was a great experience, and I'm excited to try again.",2
This used be Cathy House. . Now The Jade. . It is an improvement. . Dim sum is way better. Prices are still to be determined. They need to quickly get rid of the Nasty carpet and remodel the bathrooms. . They are busy and could use some help with getting the dim sum carts around more quickly. . Over good place.,2
"WACK! For someone that frequents vegas fairly often, I figured why not spend a ish load of money to see what the hype is about. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed. The only good thing was the unlimited mamosas, but everything there was not kept to temperatue and they did not have a huge selection. MGM Grand and bellagio are way better and way cheaper! Don't waste your money!",1
"Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. In every way this place is a hell hole and it's terrible. Do not buy meat or produce from here. Take my word for it, you will be sorry. Customer service is non existent. Cheap prices but it is never an easy in out at this place. Over crowded with trashy people. I'm so sick of this place I just cannot go back. I've been to other Wal Marts that are not this terrible.",1
"OMG! If you have not been here you need to go. This place just opened has a small specialized menu. They owner is the chef he knows his stuff. This place is more than spring rolls they have fantastic rice plates, PHO, sandwhiches more. Very clean, friendly, well priced AMAZING food! Seriously, you need to visit this place. Local business, local owner fresh hand made food.",2
"Dang the best rib tips ever and bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers. They had 2 different types of BBQ sauce and the habanero one had a great flavor. I do not know what they stuff the jalapeno poppers with but it was delicious. I talked with a few people at the bar and it was a nice crowd. I have to go back when I am hungry to try the ribs, the plate I saw was huge.",2
The steaks are phenomenal and way too large for a normal person. The highlight was a tiny glass of potato soup with a drizzle of green leek puree. I wish I had a bowl of this delicious soup. Beautiful wine collection. Excellent service and a beautiful place. Very reminiscent of a classic Las Vegas steak house. Would definitely visit again.,2
"I stayed in the pyramid part of the hotel in one of the jr. suites and it was fantasic! The room was always super clean and the maids were so cool they left us extra extra extra chocolate mints. It was in a convenient location on the strip and when we needed extra anything pillows, shampoo, even a steamer for our clothes.they happily gave it to us. I would definitely come and stay here again!",2
"What a great place! The perfect place to find a gift and a card, of course. My favorite finds n Fun book selectio Cute recipe cards n Charlotte souvenirs n Out of the ordinary baby shower gifts My actual purchase was a great Shiraleah handbag. I could see myself spending way too much money here if I was a local.",2
"They sat us and forgot about us? People that were seated after us were leaving because they already ate. I got the unlimited orange juice. Right! I had to ask three times for a refill. The skillet was very small. The over easy eggs were a bit cold. And the basket of toast was a great idea. But what's with putting 2 jellies for 4 people. Are we at war? This place wasn't cheap. Actually, it was.",1
"This is the Best fast food burger anyWhere to be found, BETTER THAN FIVE GUYS and RAY'S HELL BURGER HANDS DOWN. IT IS FLAVORFUL AND DELICIOUS, NOT GREASY AND NOT OVERPRICED! THE BUN IS GOOD AND THE CONDIMENTS ARE GREAT TOO! The other thing is the polite and courteous staff, the place is immaculate too! I wish they'd coem out East!",2
"We enjoyed dinner at R. The Riviera is not the trendiest or flashiest place on the strip, but don't overlook this restaurant. The service was excellent and the food was very good. While items are prices ala carte, the serving sizes were more than ample to justify the price. Thanks to Groupon for providing us the opportunity to try something new in Las Vegas.",2
"This is a review for the pool a cabana is a must! On our first day we realized how crowded the pool gets, so the following day we rented a cabana. Reasonable prices, and great service! Our waitress, Haley, was fab. Our pool was perfect for people watching, there were a lot of really fun people there!",2
I'm giving Budget one star already. After reading bad reviews about other car companies I went with Budget. Don't rent from here if you don't have lots of time to sit in the airport. Every other company I could have walked up and rented a car. Here I'm number 27 they are on 13 and I've been sitting here for 20 minutes.,1
"i went to old stone last october for lunch. we sat outside on the patio, it was kind of a chilly out but they have fire places that were on that made the patio very comfortable and provided a nice ambiance. i had the rib eye steak sandwich which was fantastic. the wait staff was very polite and attentive. overall it was a great experience and i plan on coming back next time im in the area.",2
"My credit card company is now disputing the additional charge on my card from Dollar for the car rental which totals about 300. Dollar charged me these fees on top of the I already paid to Spirit Airlines for flight car. American Express is the best CCC. They said they would take care of everything! Meanwhile, the extra charges and were taken off my card.",1
"they overbook their routes. be careful. if you have a trip, show up over an hour early and get in line so you are assured a seat on the bus. bring sunglasses and earplugs due to the rude people playing their cellphone games and laptop games. and the other people that keep that light use your sunglasses to block out the light.",1
"I work graveyards around the corner and this location is supposed to be 24 hours. Well they Lie! Your overnight employee locked the doors and turned the lights off on me when I walked up! Terrible business and a prime example of false advertisement! Im defiantly going to better business bureau about this! Screwed me out of dinner, thanks ",1
"I would probably put it at 4.5 stars if there was an option. This has been the best overall dining experience in Pittsburgh since I moved here a few months ago. A lot of places in Pitt are hype machines, but this is the real deal if you like good old fashion American style breakfast grub. The place has character, too.",2
"Just had some FANTASTIC pizza at Papa Christos. It's PACKED for lunch every day of the week. There's a reason why locals keep coming back. My wife and I had pepperoni and the vegie pizza with spinach, feta and mushrooms. Excellent! Very fresh ingredients. Hot out of the oven. Served fast. Met the owner Horatio . He's very friendly. From Romania. Family owned.",2
It was the worse service I have ever experienced at a sushi joint. They took over half an hour to bring the appetizers to our table and the 4 rolls I ordered. Then they forgot about me and didn't come by for another half an hour. I was just waiting and waiting. Sushi wasn't very tasteful either. Won't be coming back again. You'd have a Better time down the street at yama sushi!,1
"This sub shop has the freshest sandwiches around. I like to try a different sub each time and they have been all great with plenty of meat. The bread is also very fresh. The sandwich makers are always friendly and use plenty of fixins. I find myself coming back here every time, even though a subway is much closer.",2
Really ejoyed this place. It has a pool. Bowling alley. Movie theater. Laser waterfall show. Buffet. A free shuttle ride to the strip. Its benefits is a little slower pace and a getaway from the crazyness. It maybe a 3 star hotel in Vegas but other places it would be a 5 star. Staff was friendly. Rooms were adequate. Im come back.,2
"I went there a week ago and I got one of the most uneven haircuts in my life, the guy cutting my hair seemed like he was just grabbing hair and cutting randomly which showed in the result as my hair looked worse than it did when I left. I had to go to a different barber the next day to fix it up. I would not go back. It was one of the messiest and worst haircuts I have received.",1
"Do not order take out! These geniuses put all take out tickets with dine in tickets. We ended up waiting 40 mintues to order! When we got our sandwiches 15 minutes later, the sliders were ice cold, the fries were old and not hot and my patty melt was luke warm at best. MilkShake was damn good though.",1
"Went for a 90 min. presentation. Ended up spending a total of 3 hours. Was going to walk away from the gifts when the time was getting to 3 hours. Was walking out when we finally got the 2nd ""manager "" to okay the refund of our deposit plus the 100. and gift coupon. The only positive was the gal Ana Lisa who did a wonderful presentation. nBeware if you go to a time share presentation.",1
I asked a friend for directions to the place she gets her nails done and luckily I am not very good at directions and ended up here. From the moment you walk in you can tell this salon is filled with regulars. Everybody knows everybody! Desiree did my nails and I can't imagine going anywhere else. Everytime I leave I very happy with my services!,2
"Yes this place has great food. The ambiance is a bit like hanging out in grandmas kitchen with a bunch of tvs surrounding you and a bar with yummy drinks. I have no idea why this place is called bostons other than the fact the server understood my boston sarcasm. It's in a sketchy location, but not far from downtown Tempe",2
"I've been here only once and really enjoyed this place. I shared the baby back ribs and rib stew with my friends. We were all moaning anf groaning from the savory goodness. This is really awesome comfort food. Also, they have some of my favorite wines on their list. Just what I need after a long day!",2
"Hands down the most unprofessional, unreliable cab company I have ever dealt with. Scheduled a cab pickup for the airport over 24 hours in advance. The cab was over an hour late, we ended up missing our flight and spending 600 to rebook for our family, 8 hours later. I'd rather walk through the desert than get into a Yellow Cab ever again",1
"In a city filled with knock off fine dining, this isn't bad but I'm guessing itsnothing like the LA institution of international fame. since, it was alright. I wasn't blown away, which i was fully expecting to happen. However, since I've never been to the LA one I'm willing to be disapointed for now with an option to pleasantly surprised later.",2
"I highly recommend this hike to anyone in the Phoenix, AZ area. My bf and his parents all joined me on this hike. We had beautiful views of the Superstition Mountains. There were cactus plants everywhere. We decided to start the hike a little later, so we can watch the sunset. The sunset definitely had a great contrast with the mountains.",2
So we have always enjoyed Rainbow Garden but with each visit it seemed to get worse. Today was the lowest of lows . I think we were the first ones in there this time and the food came out cold. They weren't quick to change that. But after some persistence they brought out fresh. nI think Golden Harbor is more worth the money.,1
"I was fully intending to give this place a 5 star review after receiving an awesome neck and back massage from Damien, except he massaged me for 30 minutes instead of the requested 20 minutes, I almost missed my flight and had to pay for the 30 minute massage. I would recommend their services, but watch the clock yourself!",1
"This review is for The Forum. Wow I really enjoyed shopping in The Forum, the architecture and design of the place is great. The shops are quite nice to check out, event the seating areas are awesome to relax and people watch. If you have check out this is an awesome place to spend some time as you can find free wifi in here and there are plenty of clean washrooms.",2
"WORST FOOD EVER! I went there for their lunch specials and got the sweet and sour chicken. The egg roll was great, but the sweet and sour chicken was horrible. The sauce had no flavor and ruined my entire dish. Depending on your liking, the there were very thick peices of chicken within the dish with very little breading. I personal enjoy breading with my sweet and sour chicken.",1
I only wish they have one in So Cal. I had the Kuro and the broth is so rich and nothing I've tasted here. We have a lot of great ramen places here but nothing like Monta. The manager was also super nice and called us a cab. The wait was long but totally worth it. The fried rice was also yummy! My new go to ramen spot when I'm in town.,2
"I had the coffee at Royal this weekend and it was just not as good as I remember it from their downtown location. Now.it may be me, maybe I have changed, but I think it was more the skill level of the barista. Not so hot. The coffee was still decent, but I'm hoping it is back to the deliciousness that it was when it was downtown.",2
"I think this place has some of the best tacos in town. I highly recommend the vampiro. It's a carne asada taco on steroids. The guac is fantastic and mashed at your table. My fiance and I love Sol's margaritas. I've had the house and ginger blueberry. Both were very good. This place had a very cool vibe, it's stylish but not pretentious. I highly recommend this place",2
"Excellent service! Rick is friendly, professional , and generous. Quick service and quality results. I had a few stains in my carpet I was worried about and when the job was done the carpet looked brand new. He was even kind enough in assisting me move some furniture! I definitely recommend Carpet Monkeys!",2
1st time trying Peruvian food! AMAZEBALLS! It was between 1 4 roasted chicken my sides were cilantro rice n fried plantains or shredded chicken quinoa in an avocado bowl. I couldn't decide so I had both. So yummy. Plenty of left overs to bring home.my 2nd dinner. Lol They have very friendly staff.cute and bubbly. Highly recommend! U won't be disappointed.,2
"Meh. either pay for table service or don't bother. The lack of a VIP list on saturday nights leads to frustration that even the bouncers feel gross about. My peeps and I waited two hours in line staring at the stupid Belts and Baubles store while posers, greasy hipsters and large and lovely? brides to be walked by. We bailed.",1
"This is a really unique and cool bar in one of the newest casinos in Vegas. 3 levels, and plenty of room. Wasn't very crowded I was there in the afternoon and our waitress was enjoyable. Their cocktail menu has a lot of random concoctions and something new for everyone. Give it a try next time your in Vegas!",2
"Cinnamon Vanilla French Toast for only 3.99?! Wow, that's a deal! I had ordered it with extra crispy bacon on the side. One of the downside.my hubby ordered Greek Omelette but asked for Egg Beaters.they don't have it, they only have egg whites. Why don't have it? Apparently they don't stock those, ONLY egg whites.",2
"Mid priced dining with high end flavor. I ordered the special Yelp menu. Started off with mixed green salad with fig dressing. Very good. Moved on the the ""smart "" chicken. Tender, char grilled breast with corn risotto. Yum! Topped it off with a perfect chocolate de creme. Staff was friendly and very on top of things. Great experience. I'm definitely coming back. give these guys some love!",2
Pittsburgher managed and owned . great service and food with a friendly Pittsburgh hometown style. Wimpy hamburgers and Pittsburgh Willy hotdogs are tasty. Randy does a great job in making your experience a comfortable one with quality food. A pleasant place for a quick bit in old town Chandler Az. One of a kind. ,2
My ladyfriend gets tipsy on one glass of wine.she drank the whole lemonade drink supposedly infused with alcohol and felt nothing.and she is the one whi staggers twice a year on 2 glasses of wine at Christmas.a Slushy.nothing more.not worth the 24 we paid at Groupon.for 2 slush drinks similar the refills we got the next day at Walgreens on the strip for 1.99 ,1
"I'm disappointed in myself for only going for lunch! This place was that good, having a lot of the standard buffet fare but at such a higher quality. Favorites lamb, mac and cheese, freshly made balsamic strawberry ice cream. The only thing I didn't like was their bland, unusually flavored al pastor tacos.",2
"The owner is there everyday, which is cool. nThe prices are decent if u don't mind basically paying for a Rice Bean Burrito with a dash of meat! n I don't want a bunch of filler, i want meat w filler.not Filler w meat They have a special on Friday's but. its no good for me because I doubt I'll try it again. I've been here 3x ",1
"Words cannot explain how amazing this place is. The brisket literally falls to pieces and does not need any sauce but the sauce is just as delicious! The pork ribs are something that the gods have gifted to us meer humans. This BBQ had changed my standards of BBQ! The beans, potato salad and pecan pie dessert are seriously the most delicious thing ever. This place is LIFE changing. Period.",2
"Been to Vegas 15 times, have stayed exclusively at the HRH the last 4 years. BEST hotel for the 25 35 year old crowd. No kids to be seen, the pool parties are outrageous and the restaurants are good Mr. Lucky's is my fav cheap American food. Yum. If you want to party don't stay anywhere else! Oh and don't plan on leaving Sunday, stay until Monday and don't miss Rehab!",2
We booked a room at the Luxor and they gave us free tickets to attend the club. This nightclub is whack and probably one of the worse clubs in Vegas. The layout of the club is like a hallway and there are people shoved together in it. It's uncomfortable and totally cramped feeling. Was not a fun experience and will never go back there again.,1
This is an excellent buffet that has yet to fail me or upset my stomach see my review of the Rio Buffet . They have a great selection of dishes that are of good quality. Their lines for the weekend brunch can look long but they definitely move quickly. This is definitely one of the better buffets in Vegas and one you'll want to wear your fat pants to.,2
"If you want a great wash then don't come here. If you want someone to get dust off, then this is your place. I had to pretty much dry the entire car off when I got home and got rid of the left over dirt. Kind of missing the point of a ""car wash "" tipped the dryer guys 5. Next time I will get out of the car and review their lack of detail before tipping so much.",1
"Fool me twice.Left clothes there on Friday and was promised a Tuesday pick up, which honestly is tool long. Came back Tuesday to be tol Wednesday morning, wednesday morning Wednesday evening. I Had a similar experience a bout 6 months ago and decided, foolishly, to try them one more time. If you want to wait 3 4 business days for your clothes, this is the place.",1
"The concept is very unique and fun. Unfortunately the food falls very short of what you would expect. The burgers are somewhat basic in flavor of the meat and have a bland taste. The fries were expected to be outstanding but they were limp, barely cooked and mushy. Overall I am glad I tried it but not sure it is worth another trip.",1
I read about this Muse in a local paper. I was very excited to check out this boutique. I was very disappointed in the clothes because I felt like I could go to the mall and find the same shirt dress for half the price. I don't know why you would open up a boutique if your not going to have a unique selection of clothes. I'm surprised this place is still open.,1
"Aloft offers some very nice rooms that leave you with a fancy modern feel on your stay. Aloft is a young hip vibe overall with it's young staff, cozy bar, and a friendly young staff. Worth staying at again if I'm ever ieed of a hotel. Easy stay close to the airport with complimentary shuttle. Led light display in the bar is trippy.",2
"Very disappointed. I always use yelp to look for nearby restaurants, but this BBQ place was not something I expected. They are overpriced. Ordered the surf and turf for 16.99 it was only cheap BBQ pork not properly seasoned and a small daing na Bangus. The halo halo was not good at all for 6.99 it had chunk of ice and not enough n ""Sahog "". Never again will I go to this place again.",1
"2 stars for good service although the hostess skipped us even though we did the ""call ahead "" nThe food at outback is mediocre at best. I never order steak there bc it doesn't measure up to Flemings, Mastros etc. nMahi mahi is dry. nCesar salad w chicken precooked slices was bland. nCheese fries w ranch are great when yr drunk.",1
"I just realized that I've eaten here at least 16 times.wonder why I'm getting a little chubby? I've got to say that the service, especially at the bar, is awesome. In the interest of fairness, I do notice some differences in food quality of certain items I think it depends on who's cooking but they've been really open to constructive feedback, which I do appreciate.",2
"AWESOME hushpuppies, and for a hole in the wall type place, their food is GOOOOOD. It's hot, fresh, nice service and they don't have thick breading on their catfish, it's coated just right. I am not a fan of fried shrimp and asked if I could substitute extra fried oysters and they did with no problem at all. I've always liked this place and will continue to go back anytime ",2
"Dim sum is hot, comes around frequently and the people are nice. I do think they are a little over priced and sometimes I feel like I'm being cheated because they can stamp any price section without me verifying it's the right price for the item I got. But the food is good and service is fine. Oddly enough I always bring my own chopsticks though because theirs are VERY waxy and hard to eat with.",2
"We have eaten here twice and both times the sandwiches were great. The bitchwich is the favorite in our office. Only issue we had was delivery. They took our order and scheduled delivery and then called and told us their service would deliver to us. When we went to pickup our order, they gave us free chips for our trouble. Will definitely return.",2
"Food average to good nService Horrible We waited forever to get our breakfast, about 50 minutes. The place was practically empty. Servers were coming around but never came past our table. Frustrating and a huge waste of time to go there. The casino isn't even that exciting has more older people. Just don't bother.",1
"So my niece's graduation cake was DELISH!. I mean pink champagne with custer filling?. and the cookies? SOOOOOOOOOO GOOOD! But. when ordering the cake I was told by staff that it was a 1 2 sheet cake. When I picked up the order, it was a 1 4 sheet cake. REALLY? For the size of cake I picked up verse what I ordered. I'm not a happy customer. But for the cake itself?. SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOD!",1
"Probably the best thing I ate in Pittsburgh was a sausage sandwich from here. It was so simple and a touch spicy, just perfect. This was the real food I imagined when I planned my trip here. The staff was delightful and excited about their food. It's a total shithole, but in a beautiful way. I love Frankies.",2
"if you go upstairs and down an unmarked alleyway you'll find some of the best pizza in las vegas this place is really good but the problem is its not that consistent. its ok because it hit the spot both times i came here! i liked how this is a secret unmarked place the pizza is very well made. not too much sauce, just the right amount of cheese and thin crust!",2
"Fantastic experience! Laura was very personable and took the time for a consultation to ensure she was giving me the level of color I wanted. I was in town for a wedding so having the perfect bronze was crucial. My tan lasted for more than a week and faded pretty naturally. The yelp coupon is an amazing deal, but I think even the full price is worth it. Thanks!",2
Nice place good location.but be ready for a UP SALE. .they tell you they aren't doing.but do.a normal clean exam xray for 40.turned out to be 740.if I wanted the clean. They did give me my 40 back. But wow like they say too good to be true of a deal.IT IS!.not a up sale ha ha.totally was. The dentist didnt even have shrubs on.how would I even know he was the dentist?,1
"Dr. Fife is my go to guy for all my root canals. He's gentle, caring, and efficient. He is also great at following up with his patients to see how they feel. I am never sore or swollen after any work done with him, and he's always available for emergencies. Great guy, great office staff, and great service.",2
"It is sad that when I used to live in Chandler I never visited this place. Their beers are ok, although I like more the 4peaks heffeweizen. There was one, that definitely should be a joke.the smokey beer or something like that. Don't order that one I guess u have to smoke cigars to appreciate the nasty flavor . Nice location, and downtown Chandler is a good excuse to stop by this place.",2
"Food was fantastic, as was the service. However, after dinner the 10 of us 3 couples and 6 singles who ordered a wide variety of food and drink had to figure out our share of the food, taxes, and added gratuity. Amazing that with computers that separate checks could not be given. We won't be going back with a large group.",2
"There were plenty of choices in the Emerald Isle when I arrived, after midnight. The staff was polite and helpful. My only complaint is National is doing what others do, putting both key fobs on one ring. I know this is so both sets of keys go with the car, on one way rentals, but for the rest of us customers it's a great inconvenience.",2
"I love Charlotte Douglas International airport and rate this place highly.However on visiting the toilets several times recently the toilet seats were old and cracked, not at all beffiting this show case.They weren't up to standards in my oppinion. nIf they can afford multi million for a new concourse then a trip to Lowes is peanuts.",2
"If you like Bass Pro Shops.then you might be a redneck. Contrary to this statement, I am the opposite but I do like this store. Where else can you buy guns and ammo and shop for fishing rods. Aside from Wal Mart of course. They have tons of cool stuff at this store. A little over priced sometimes but you cannot help walk around this store and think that the USA is so awesome!",2
"Yuck. You let me down, Yelp. I'm new to the area and haven't found all the good pizza places yet, I'm very disappointed with the quality of the pizza here. They don't use fresh ingredients a slop of frozen spinach and canned mushrooms piled high on a salty pizza. Won't be getting pizza from here again.",1
"I've never felt compelled to write a review before, but alas. here I am. We ordered for delivery the chicken cordon bleu pizza. We did this specifically because the thought of bleu cheese on a pizza sounded intriguing. I could not find any blue cheese. Anywhere. To top it off, they made it without any sauce. Unimpressed, to say the least.",1
"Wow, Treasure Island hotel rooms are dark, smelly, and have moldy bathrooms with water stained doors. I expected better. Stayed on the 24th floor. Nice View, but wow. There's also a 28 resort fee. Not a clean freak, but expected the toilet seat to be clean. Yikes. I couldn't sleep thinking about that. Go somewhere else.",1
"By far the worst pedicure my sister and I have ever gotten. I think there was more paint on my toes than on my toenails. And my sister was cut twice on her cuticles. I would give zero stars if I could. We are trying to find a good nail salon in this area, but this is not it. Save your money and go somewhere else.",1
"I hate this place. They don't have cheese all they have is this disgusting liquid cheese. I almost vomed when I looked at my eggs Benedict and it was smothered iacho cheese. Our waitress was so rude! Gave us dirty looks and I felt that she hated her job and was annoyed we were coming to eat breakfast. Sat out on ""deck area "" and there were fly trappers hanging from the ceiling. Never coming back!",1
"I love this place! nFinally found a convenient, affordable, and delicious middle eastern food! nFantastic Falalels, hummus' tabouli, and the like. nMy very picky lady even devours their shawarma! nHealthy, tasty, and inexpensive, you won't find a better mom n pop local joint serving up this level of tastiness!",2
"I go here to get my prescriptions, since it is close to where I live. The pharmacy staff is always SO rude, and if there was a different pharmacy near my house, I would quit going here all together. Going to pick up my prescription always puts me in a bad mood because of the rudeness of the staff. I may just start driving out of my way to get my prescriptions if the staff doesn't shape up soon.",1
Hanny's is a nice place for a date. The food is very good and it is reasonably priced. The pizza and sandwiches here are quite delectable and always seem satisfying. Service is prompt and insightful. The only bad point of Hanny's is I believe they over price their beers and wine. Other than that this is a pretty cool spot.,2
This is a good park! It is a public park so you can expect to find the occasional used bandaid and cigarette butt in the sand but so long as you keep an eye on your little one mine is only one then you should be fine. I love that they have two separate playgrounds one for older kids and one for younger!,2
"I went there with a coupon for BOGO buffets. My stomach wishes I hadn't. Some of it was better than other. The service was great. The cheese Enchiladas were disgusting. The Sopapillas were good, the icecream? was funny tasting. With the coupon it was still about 17 for two with two softdrinks and a tip, so I say skip it and go somewhere else. Your stomach will thank you.",1
"We loved this place when it first opened, it was my favorite buffet, but then we kinda a took a break and hadn't been back until now, we heard it might have changed, and boy they did! You can still get free wine and beer, the soups and artisan breads are good, the desserts are good, but the rest of the buffet is hit or miss. Here's hoping they restore the quality!",1
"Called to see if they had a particular tire in stock. Told by Javier they had 3 in stock. nI only needed 1 as I had a blowout. Went iext morning to purchase it and Javier says "" Must of sold them can put you on a similar tire. "" Who buys three tires. The old bait and switch. Crappy way to do business.",1
"came here for the brunch buffet. and of course when in vegas. eat your heart out! hmm. actually, that's my motto for everywhere and anywhere you go. the buffet is just ok. selections weren't THAT great.and nothing really stood out from the selections. my advice. stick to the Buffet at the Wynn. if you're gonna pay 30 bucks for a buffet, stick to the Wynn. never fails there.",1
"Came here for their famous Stromboli and definitely did not disappoint. I ordered the full size meatball but was only able to eat half. It's huge! Not sure about their other menu choices but I'm sure it's all good. The service was fast and the staff was friendly. FYI, the stromboli is half off after midnight.",2
"This is one of the few places I can go and almost everything on the menu looks and tastes delicious. The corn cakes and ribs are two of my favorites, but I have never been disappointed. Prickly pear iced tea is excellent also. The atmosphere is nice and dim with cozy booths and prompt servers. This is one of my regular places ",2
"When 3 of us went in on a Sunday, it was not busy at all. There were only 2 people working so we had to wait a little longer to each get pedicures. There was not tons of colors but enough to choose from and not be overwhelmed! It's a small place, with 4 pedicure chairs and 3 manicure stations. They were very friendly and gave a great pedicure massage! I'd come back.",2
"I'm not a big shopper, but when I'm looking for something specific to wear for an event, I usually check out Fashion Show. There are a lot of tourists which can put off locals, but I like to go midweek really early or really late. Good selection of stores at all price points so it's worth a stop for locals and visitors.",2
"Not the tastiest food in town, but not the worst. Go for simple meals that are hard to mess up and you should be OK. I'd go to this place for convenience rather than for the taste of the food. Keep your expectations to a minimum. I also find it odd that this is a favorite place amongst some of the tech startups in the tannery.",1
"Let me begin by saying I'm not a big fan of bloody Mary's, so after a long night of drinking I guess this was the perfect remedy for a hangover, and boy these were damn good! You can customize it to your liking anyway you want it and they have tons of topping options it's crazy mad! I also had the oysters not bad for 2 bucks a piece I would so come back here next time I'm in town",2
I almost missed this spot because I didn't see any English language sign but I am glad I persevered. The server was helpful and of course I knew what I wanted beforehand. The spicy beef with beef tendon was filled with fresh chewy homemade noodles and an earthy broth. I added additional chili sauce but it was spiced right for most palates. A nice change from the Strip.,2
"Food is awesome. Idle servers, hostess and bartender socialize, eat and check cell phones in full view of customers. Busboy was the only one hustling everyone else was just killing time in between service. Totally lacking in professionalism. Hostess chewing snapping gum with a bored attitude. Wouldn't go back except I have another restaurant.com GC.",1
"Stay away from this business! They are dishonest! Do not drop your clothes off here, donate them to charity. They caot account for items dropped off and then sold.Repeated attempts the resolve the problem have ended in frustration. We will be reporting them to the BBB. Do everyone a favor and go elsewhere!",1
"I have been visiting Pittsburgh steadily for the past 2 years and let's face it, it is a quest to find delicious and authentic ethnic food in this city. Not saying you don't, saying you put in sweat, money and imagination. nAnd then you find Las Palmas. nUpdate within 12 hours both me and partner got hit by diarrhea. There is no way in the world I am giving this business less than 5 stars.",2
"Quality shouldn't be sacrificed because this is an airport location. CPK can generally be relied on for tasty food, but this location just sucks. What you'll find here is a limited menu and an unorganized waitstaff running around with its hair on fire for no real reason. You can find better food at the airport, don't let the reliability associated with the brand name fool you.",1
"I never give one star! This place is horrible. Charged for parking, No bathroom and the place packed with loss prevention from hell. I'm talking like ten guys. makes you wonder if I'm really saving any money here. Just go down the street to the other Ross. You don't have to pay for parking, not sure about the bathroom situation though",1
"Awesome place! Had time to kill so I stopped in for a deluxe pedicure. Customer service was awesome! The manager ensured everyone was having a pleasant time. The nail tech giving my pedi was amazing! Mina took her time to decorate my nails and they are super cute. I'll be back! Today in fact, for a gel mani.",2
at least theres some kind of public transportation in phx. I'm use to the bart from living in sf and the metro in dc but this kind of gets you place to place. Ill take it downtown to a d backs game but when parking is easy would rather drive I would only take this train if Im going to mill ave in tempe! I am sad it doesn't get you to old town where that's necessary!,2
"Yum! We went to a few brunch places and this was definitely the best. The food is delicious and everything goes together. The sun dried tomato pasta was my great and the cheesecake was to die for. I would probably pay the 22 just for the cheesecake, it was that good. This place is pretty expensive and mimosas are not included.",2
"I love it here! My boyfriend and I always get the surf and turf burger! So juicy and tender. I love love love their fries. It's just the right amount of crispy! However, the service is not consistent. We get good servers to terrible servers that only checks up on us twice. To get the order and the second time to bring our order.",2
I decided to stop here because the Tempe location is great. Glendale.not so great! The soda was watered down and the wings were so basic. Something I could've heated up from a Tyson bag. Not only that but the 1 2lb or 1lb deal is expensive for what they give. Kinda disappointed that this place sucked because Tempe is better.,1
"Service was great. I went around 3 00 to miss the traffic. The chicken is good for takeout spot. i prefer there chicken over KFC, and pop eyes, or NYC crown or Kennedy's . nThe tater tots where cold, nothing special, Cole slaw good, and hush puppies are good. Sweet tea is done right. The Chicken greatest quality is the flakiness.",1
"who doesn't love fro yo!?! I just wish it wasn't next to sprinkles because it's always such a tough choice as to which one to get! big fan of this yogurtland.even when it's really busy, the fro yo and topping area is always really clean and fully stocked! the staff has always been friendly too. yelp check in offer right now! 3 oz free so pile on the toppings! ",2
This is a good store. Fairly deep variety. I like to buy a bunch of reasonably priced greating cards. It allows me to already have when I need them. I got 6 congratulations cards for three dollars total. They have good buys on batteries at considerable true savings. It is worth checking out to see if they have a number of true values for you.,2
"Very disappointed in the quality of food here. Carne Asada is supposed to be seared, not charred. Sent it back once, got it back the same way. Girlfriend got the ahi tuna tacos, got Scombroid food poisoning. Furthermore, our waitress had little to no clue about the items on the menu, and came once during the main course, despite working on silverware 5 feet away from my table.",1
"Ricky and his family keep the best Vietnamese in town low key, top quality and with a Midas touch. His Pho is from scratch, meats of top quality, and attention to detail great. If you are lucky he will pause from his passion of cooking and come and greet you with genuine charm. He could not get a higher recommendation on his value for the cost either.",2
I've been here several times and MOST of the elderly ladies there are a couple of nice ones that volunteer here are rude. The Assistance League of Las Vegas do lots of good for the Vegas community and you would think that the ladies that represent them would be kind like the organization. Prices are a bit high like retail but there are bargins to be found. Store is clean organized.,1
First I got a quote. nThen they transferred the guy who gave me the quote. nIt took them 3 weeks to get the part. n1 hour to install the part. nAnd then it was smooth sailing. nThey quoted me 218 nBut then only charged me 198 nI can't complain after the initial set back they did a really good job for a great price.,2
The worse pizza I have ever had hands down. Dough taste like a tortilla no flavor on pizzas at all. And maybe it's just me but I'd never have canned tomatoes and bags for flour as a display in any restaurant I work in. The one star is for the warm beats those were not bad teach the cooks to season better and they'd be good,1
"Horrible service. The waitress forgot to place my friend's order. When we asked to have her food removed from the bill, the manager argued with us and tried to say her food was not forgotten, just late. Even though it took us flagging down a different server to have him put her food in to the cook. Never again.",1
Booked the one week reservation on the Payless web site for estimated total of 204. Checkin takes perseverance to decline all they want to sign you up for. At checkout the total was 254! Explanation roadside service at 4.99 per day even though I have AAA. There is also a clause that vaguely states that taxes and fees may change without notice Wonderful car! Horrible business practices!,1
The service is BAD! The place is dirty and the staff is more interested in goofing off than taking care of business. The subs at Fry's are just as good and you won't have to wait a ridiculous amount of time to get one. This location is busy . but not because it's anything special. I think they could really use a management team? Someone needs to step in and clean things up.,1
"This place is so good. The owners Ivan and Chona were very personable and the samples were wonderful, we ended up getting a good selection of BBQ Chicken, BBQ Pork Belly, and Shrimp and Beef Skewers. We also had the banana rolls with ice cream, Go in the side door and not the main door, unless you love the smell of fish. The smell is not coming from Wholly Grill, but it is in the market.",2
"Had an awful crab cake here with little crab in it but mostly lots of breading and filler. Even the Phillips brand ones at Costco are better than most. And of course Eleven has the best ever. But anyways, hubby got a deep fried cod filet that was sandwiched between 2 hamburger buns, which was pretty decent fried fish while it was hot and crispy. But my crab cake was sadly unforgivable.",1
We ate at Rico's for dinner on Sunday night. By far the worst service we have ever had. From the surly hostess to having to ask the waitress for our drink orders. Food service was extremely slow. Waitress even messed up the food order. It was recommended by the concierge at the Pointe Hilton. He should be ashamed for recommending it.,1
"This post office is understaffed whenever I visit. Today there was a line nearly to the door with one person working at the counter. The vending machines are regularly out of the most popular stamps. It's not easily accessible, with a roundabout u turn at the end of the block required if you're coming the wrong way up Town Center Drive. Blah. I avoid this one.",1
"Food is good and the price point isn't too shabby either for Vegas standards. We ordered a bunch of items. The ones that I recommend sticking clear from are the Jidori Chicken, Hanger Steak, and Miso Cod. Oh, and the broccoli side dish too. You can totally make that at home and not be charged a leg for .",2
"I recently had an accident with my ferret. She broke her femur. They wanted to charge me 3,000! I said HELL NOOOO! Went to Desert Inn Animal Hospital. I paid 800. The vet who carried out the procedure has been doing this for 30 years. He was even on TV with my ferret. I never had to pay for sny follow ups either. Creature comfort lost a customer for good. Thank You Desert Inn Animal Hospital!",1
"This restaurant was incredible. Great service and top notch food. You've got to try the lobster bisque. Unbelievable. If you like scotch this place is scotch heaven. It has one of, if not the biggest selections, of scotch in the western United States. Alexis was our server and she is a true professional and personable. Craftsteak is a must!",2
"Thank you Kathy! I've been here before for a quick cut and style and again, for 35, it doesn't get much better than this. I'd pay more for the quality I get here. Been to James many times in the past, but called last minute and was booked with Kathy for the first time. Very impressed and I have my layers back again and was in and out io time. ",2
"This place has Powers.and they aren't magical. They have actual Powers which is rare to see now a days . This is probably because Powers makes magic happen or the precise opposite, more likely. More likely jail time in Louisiana but that is a special story. They have good Guinness, good outside tables, and a magnificent whiskey selection if you have that kind of money. I am definitely a fan ",2
"Food here is very tasty and the wait time was minimal. We had 5 people, all ordered different dishes, and ate it family style. Each dish was delicious and couldn't be more satisfied. The chow mein and sweet and sour chicken was amazing and I would definitely recommend. The service was mediocre, they weren't good but they weren't horrible either. All in all I will definitely be back",2
NOT OPEN ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY?! You have to be a bold restaurant to not be open on some busy eatin' out days. I am going to rate this initially and will come back and revise. I was so blinded by all the great reviews that I didn't seem to look at the hours. All I can say is that when I finally eat here it better blow my mind! To be continued.,1
"Really disappointed in our experience last night. The crawfish were VERY tiny. Great flavor, but had to struggle so much to get the meat out of the tiny shell that it mashed it all up. Talked to our server and she confirmed they were smaller than in the past. This was our 3rd time at this location and unfortunately, the last.",1
"Stay far far away! For a Station Casino this place was VERY DIRTY, crap all over the floors and dust along wall of our booth. I can handle a little mess during a busy eating time but not when it is close to 9PM. Will not be back and I will be writing a letter to someone. I felt bad, I took an out of town friend there. The food was below what I expected aswell.",1
"We agree with the last review.there's no reason to trash this place, everything was great. Food was good, place was clean, decor is cool, people were super friendly especially considering we were there an hour after close , the cook was awesome performing tricks. The only thing is dinners are 12.49 which is ok on occasion, but the 1 beers totally made up for it!",2
First time ever getting my haircut at great clips. Good experience overall. Was greeted seated promptly. Michelle cut my hair did a very good job. My last haircut was at a salon I paid 35. The 12 cut from Michelle was better than the 35 cut. I will definitely be going back every 4 weeks. Great cut especially for the price.,2
"Skip it. The sushi was average and was served too warm for my liking. We tried the Vegas roll and the tempura was thick and greasy. Another post said it best by calling it ""blah "". Nothing overly exciting about the rolls. Atmosphere and service was great. Happy Hour prices were fantastic, but I guess you get what you pay for. There are several better options around.",1
"I had had two drinks and the slot lady cut me off! I had two drinks after 5 hours, the security guard found nothing wrong with me and the cocktail waitress told me I was only able to drink water! This place is cheap as heck and found every reason to nickel and dime me through out our stay. STAY AWAY!",1
"Wow, is this some fantastic food! It was the first non chain restaurant we ate at during our vacation and I couldn't be more pleased. Not only was the staff friendly and attentive, the food was phenomenal. Presentation and taste were top notch. The Tai fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town. Visit Date 11 18 09",2
"Had a water, and possible mold emergency on Friday night, I called them very early Saturday morning explaining the situation, and after four days, I still haven't got a call back from their project manager to set up a time for them to come out. I'm going with another company. I wish they'd told me 4 days ago they were too busy to come.",1
"Based on the reviews on Yelp, I decided to call. So glad I did. Brad was great. He was at my house within a couple of hours. He fixed the problem io time and even cleaned up once he finished. He was extremely professional and very affordable. Will definitely call him again if I ever need an electrician.",2
Disappointing. Scheduled a massage for my elderly father. He could not find the location. He did not have the number to inform them. I called to reschedule and they would not honor the Groupon pomotional value nor the amount paid for the Groupon. They essentially collected my 29.00 donation and told me that my father should have called to cancel the appointment.,1
If I could I would not even give this a star this nail shop is awful the employees are mean crud and they laugh and make you as a customer feel as if they are laughing at you as a paying customer nI have tried this nail spot several different times to give them several chances but nI still leave hating myself for even walking back in to this shop,1
"I love this joint. Though if I had been given the naming rights, I would have called it Lisa G.'s Beer and Balls. I love the beer, and as many others have proclaimed, ""I LOVE LISA G.'S BALLS! "" Awesome. The seafood salad is also really excellent if you are a seafood fan. It's got a ton of protein, and it's very filling. Go there. Now!",2
Haven't even tried the food or drinks yet but have been sitting in the patio after the host told us we can sit wherever and will be served. 20 minutes later and nobody will acknowledge us. I know the place is new but the service is the worst I've experienced in a very long time. Once more places open in downtown summerlin this will be last on my list.,1
"This place is just ok. Had fun drinking and signing karaoke, but service is a bit slow. Margaritas are weak and overpriced. Nachos were bland. Fried pickles were good! Haven't tried any entrees yet. I'd go back with friends, just because it's close to our house, but I wouldn't just go for dinner or anything.",1
"When in Vegas, always go for a Fat Tuesday. Price is not that bad compared to other places that serve similar drinks aka the Yard ones . You can choose your drinks or pick out from the already custom made popular ones. I picked the bloody smurf. Overall, the service was really good and the bartender was hilarious. D",2
"I went in yesterday and got a gel manicure with Kevin, he did an excellent job! This place gives me the ""life's good feel "". When you're having a rough day and need to relax this is a perfect place to unwind. They provide refreshments and great customer service! I loved it SOOO much I am here right now writing this review! Brought two friends ",2
Had to run to walmart late night the other night for some cat litter. Literally every person in the store was either rude or just completely uninterested in helping locate what I needed. They were doing a remodel which meant that everything was not in it's normal place. Let's just say I won't be going back to walmart any time soon.,1
Two stars only because the ladies working were fabulous although the one chalked my chai full of ice. Ummmm easy ice was stated in my order for a reason because I want alot of damn milk! nThe floor was dirty and there were no clean tables. nMaybe the worker bees shouldn't focus on the fashionable friendly faggot me because honey. You ain't gettione of this!,1
"Pretty yummy on a hot afternoon. I love rocky road ice cream and I love the way Cold Stone employees mix delicious ingredients to make requested item but at this point I prefer Baskin Robbins' take on Rocky Road ice cream. The young gentleman that was attending to me was kind, attentive and patient, which I greatly appreciate.",2
"We came here first time and it was really good, maybe best place in down town but today we check their hours in YELP and YELP said THEY are opening until 10 pm when we opened the door they told us that they were closing in an hour is just 8 30 that means 9 30. Yelp or you guys have to go in the same page!",1
"Simple menu and great value for being on the strip. I had the ""the brunch "" with a chicken breast and it was off the chains with a side of onion rings and sweet potato fries. Definitely hit the spot for a burger craving. For two ppl it would prob run 25 30 which is very reasonable. Would eat here again in a heartbeat and try other things",2
The food was good. If anything it was good food that was pretending to be better than it was. We went with a group of four and everyone was at least satisfied with their food. None of us left feeling it was amazing though. The thing is with a bar that is perfectly reasonable. The atmosphere was comfortable and the wait staff was playfully sarcastic. Overall I will likely go again.,2
The porterhouse steak was just average but its topping and the side that made it! We had some kind of topping that wasnt on the menu.it was a asparagus lobster topping but it made that steak! The mushroom pot pie is an absolute must order! Our waiter made all of his suggestions and made our dinner all the more delicious. The restaurant is a little too loud for a Las Vegas steakhouse,2
"Love this bar! I used to come here all the time when i lived in Summerlin, and now that im back on this side of town im happy to come here more often. I love how this is a gaming bar but not smoky like all the other ones. nFood wise ive never had a bad meal here. The spicy salami flat bread and zucchini fries are always a great idea. If your looking for an awesome local bar this is your spot.",2
Love the food but the attitude of the owners is terrible. Its like they are doing me a favor in serving there food. The heavy set ny owner needs to stay in the backround and have someone with a personality talk to customers. You have guys like jerry folding napkins instead of being aware of the customer right across the table. nFood great Service not a winner here!,1
"I have only been here for Happy Hour, but it probably the best happy hour in Scottsdale for the price. Not bad sushi and excellent happy hour drink specials. I would give this place 5 stars, but their sashimi is meh. I love their lychee flavored sake bombers. The atmosphere is really fun and if the temperature is right try to sit on the patio.",2
went there for lunch ordered two gyros which were surpisgnly filling almost didn't have room for my greek salad that I ordered. The gentleman serving us was great! We'd never eaten Greek before so we had many questions and he answered each one with a smile. Will be going back and will be recomending to others.,2
"I used to love this place. i tanned regularly for two years. because i didn't know any better. I paid 60 a month for a level 3 Gold membership. Please! I found the same membership level at BB and OneStop for dang near half that price. One one hand though, they do have a great selection of lotions, yet the computers were always down, or I was getting over charged. yadda yadda. Go somewhere else.",1
"I was really hoping for a five star restaurant, but at the end the terrible service made me regret ever stepping foot in this establishment. Our server Harmony seemed like she hated her job and not very knowledgeable in regards of the menu. Additionally she was very rude and had a bad attitude. The food was delicious, but did not makeup for the experience.",1
"I'm giving teakwoods a four based on other sports bars. I have always been happy with the food here. Though yesturdays sandwich toped everything I have tried there. I ate the pretzle philly cheese steak. It was a philly sandwich on a pretzle bun. Awesome! If you want good food, good prices, and sports. It is a good place to go. Oh yeah dont forget free peanuts.",2
"Sloppy work, terrible customer service. The employees here neglect all responsibility, my car was left a greasy mess. I could give you an entire story but I just want to be done with this place. This was by far the worst shop experience that I have EVER had and they are not even deserving of the one star. Not only will I not be going to this location, but any Greulich's location ever again.",1
the menu options are really exahustive including nepali cuisine. our order of chettinaad vegetable curry and the nepali soup can be skipped by others. The chau chau vegetable noodles were tasty. food quantity is less more expensive than other indian restaurants in Vegas. Ambience is excellent though!,1
This place is very professional and clean. Started with a consultation. It took almost a month to get in with an appointment. I worked with Adam and he was great. They also have a big drive in December partnering with WJJO and the USMC for toys for tots. Love my new ink and I will definitely go back. This is the only place in Madison I will go to!,2
"We ordered a meat lovers pizza and added mushrooms. When the pizza was delivered, I opened the box and wondered if the delivery guy had snacked on the meat and all the mushrooms on his drive to our house because there was absolutely very little meat and no mushrooms AT ALL! Very disappointed. Seems like the pizza was really made for a bambino little kid !",1
"My neighborhood pho spot always delivers just what I am looking for. I get the rare beef pho, usually to go. No extra helping of noodles needed, and once all fixings are added the soup has some decent spice and plenty of flavor. When the weather gets cold I find myself running in there all the time. The banh mi sandwiches are ok, although I personally prefer Mr. Lee.",2
"I love Einstein's bagels but this location constantly disappoints me. I go to this one as it is the closest to where I live. They have messed up my orders a few times. This morning I went by to bring a couple bagels to work, and they forgot one bagel. They also gave me a thin bagel that should not have been given out. Make sure you check that your food is all there, and it is a bagel worthy.",1
"Been going here since I was a kid, it's soooo delicious! I usually order the Ziti Alfredo pasta with added veggies, comes with a large size of freshly baked bread. Mmmm! My boyfriend gets the lasagna and says it's ""the best he's ever had "" Oh and you HAVE to get the pazooki large warm cookie pie with ice cream on top at the end. My sisters and I use to fight over that thing, it's so dang gooood",2
"I got the Fettucini Alfredo. There was a little implied pressure to order a drink and to add grilled chicken to my Fettucini. The parking lot nearly empty. I liked the fun music from the 60's. My pasta was excellent, creamy and really good. The garlic bread was perfect. I look forward to coming back here sometime.",2
HIRE MORE SERVERS OMGGGGGGGGGGG Pho is supposed to be quick. I don't understand why it takes more than 30 minutes to take an order and serve the dang food! Food was taking way too long so asked for togo but they forgot the things I asked them to include when they knew we were leaving early because we were in a rush. OMG. So frustrating,1
Food is awesome. nI'm only rating this on one particular employee that works there. Don't know the name but she has tattoos on her face. Extremely rude. nShe really must hate her job because it's showing. nI'm not one to complain but she was horrible. nWhy is she working for you're company! nThe food is GREAT ! She isn't.,1
"Was being treated for massive headaches long term with tylenol and vocoden, I changed to another local doctor to discover I had a7cm cancerous brain tumor. Lucky it was still operabke. My doc, nobody on staff attemptwd any contact wirh me to find out where I went, why, or what happened. nI'm lucky to be alive .",1
Great local Mexican restaurant. The ambiance and decor of this place were great. Really cheerful and fun environment. They even had a gentleman who sang and played guitar. nice touch! nThe food was fresh and tasty and my margarita was strong! nThe wait staff was very attentive. nThis is my new local spot for Mexican food!,2
"It consistently takes about half an hour to move twenty people through the line. Trust me, I've counted. Also, the words ""only a little salsa, please "" don't register with a lot of the line workers I'm 1 for 5. Love the food and it's really not the end of the world to wait in line.just don't go here if you're in a hurry.",1
Oil change without the hassle. Went to Big O Tires next door with a coupon and was told they didn't have any oil. So tired of oil change places trying to scam me by telling me various work and upgrades are required. This Jiffy Lube changed the oil without the nonsense pitch and hassle. Will go back.,2
"I love this store. Great prices, fresh food, and lots of options. They have great meals that are ready to cook. If you're looking for dinner or just for ideas, come here! nMore affordable than Sprouts and Whole Foods. The staff is friendly and helpful. I love coming here a few times a week. Also, they are open 24 hours! nDefinitely check them out!",2
"Beatiful bar, terrible servers. The cocktail waiters are working both gaming and lounge and for you to order a drink while sitting on their sofas was nearly impossible. It was a group of us and the cocktail waitress only came by twice in the 3 hours we were there. It's a shame because it's a realy nice place.",1
"Bartenders were a bit inattentive. Fries were tepid and limp. Prime rib on sandwich was tough. Pickle that came with it was scrawny and wilted. Upside, food came quickly. This outlet reflects poorly on the original in Denver. And being an airport is no excuse the outlet at the Denver airport does it right.",1
"Shawarmas shishtaouks are great. Everyone knows this. I've been to this place a lot it's good. But, last time I was there there were 3 teens working. They were whispering a lot and the service was super slow. I don't know what they did to my sandwich but it was terrible and somehow it was super watery. Haven't been back since.",1
"Middle of the night only one other customer the eggs and toast were cold upon arrival at the table bacon was so hard I actually broke a tooth emergency dental work today restaurant employee response to broken tooth ""sorry about that "" evidentally there was no manager on site avoid at all costs! many better options available in the area",1
I left a review on here once before and one of the owners tried to clarify something to me but I just wanted to clarify that you were mistaken. I went in alone and only had pedicure. I've never done a pedicure with a friend. My last review still remains the same. I also only review on MY experiences alone.,2
"I love this Salon. I moved to Phoenix almost 2years ago but I'm having hard time to look for a perfect Stylist just the one that I have in LA. I have super thick long hair, but Emily Claire manage it perfectly just the way I wanted to be. Last summer I decided to lighten up my hair she really did a great job. I can't wait for my next appointment to change my hair color.",2
"This Marriott meets my needs based on its location to the business sites I need to visit. My only issue id the parking which can be sort of iffy and unsafe at night. I particularly do not enjoy parking in a poorly lit, unsecured parking lot and then walking to the hotel. Nonetheless, the staff is friendly, and rooms are clean.",1
"I want to say hats off to Jill Oliver, Ivan Goldsmith, and the Trimcare team! I have struggled to find a weight loss solution for a very long time.currently on the HCG program and I LOVE it! Quick results, no hunger, feel great! Harrison is my diet coach and he is always available any time I have a question or just need a little encouragement!",2
"Excellent place for brunch or breakfast, very reasonable prices! The bus yourself thing can be a hassle if you don't hear your name called, but if you're upstairs they just yell louder! nThe scones are pretty tasty, especially onced smothered with jam! I'd definitely recommend eating here to anyone looking for cheap meal and some unusual atmosphere.",2
I've been wanting to try kaba curry ever since they were at their old location on charleston. I'm glad they relocated to china town! nI ordered the curry rice. And I added on karoke and shrimp. I also used the yelp offer and added corn. It was really good! It took a little long for my food to be made. But it was worth the wait! I left w a happy tummy and happy wallet! I will be back,2
"I haven't had Mexican food this good in L.A. Don't expect standard Mexican food drowned in gooey cheese they use a different type of cheese that crumbles on the top. I had been going there since they opened up in 1978, and whenever I am in Tempe I have to go there. Their green enchiladas with tomatillo sauce are addictive and very spicy! And their beans heavenly!",2
"Amazing appetizers, pasta and sauces. The mushroom sausage pizza as well as veal in polenta are amazing. The flavors are consistent and the spicing is on point. The desserts are pretty standard, pies or carrot cake but they are good and go well with the coffee they brew. nBest Italian food in the area, hands down",2
"If you just need a quick lunch it's probably okay to go here, but NEVER go here at 3pm 4pm. There will be no one to seat you. And worse, i forgot my credit card and the server doesnt even know. Drove 30mins to go back here and forgot to bring ID so they got to asked all sort of questions. The food is okay, but the server wont refill you until you ask.",1
"This is a must see, must do Vegas bar if you're into the history of Las Vegas. Drinks aren't outrageously priced as they are everywhere else on the strip and you can't beat the vibe in here. A scene with DeNiro and Sharon Stone was filmed in the Fireside Lounge in the movie Casino.go for that reason alone!",2
"Awesome mangement staff! I am not a fan of downtown Scottsdale, but the GM at mabels is doing a stellar job. There were a few drunk idiots there, but far less then what I have seen in the past in that area. I loved the secret room. We're considering it for an event we are having at the end of the month.",2
"I went here for the club at night one day. The decor was kinda cheesy although the view really did make up for it. I gave it a 2 Star cause it was just plain average all around Besides the great view the music, bar, and service was just plain mediocre, they could've done soo much better with what they had.",1
Love this place! Sat outside with misters. The service was perfect. The orange blossom martini was amazing fresh squeezed orange juice! We had the brushetta plank and it was delicious. The chicken caeser salad was perfect. The two pizzas were delicious definitely can tell the house made crust and high quality ingredients. The cookie ice cream dessert was yummy too. Will definitely be back.,2
"I'm from Louisiana so I tend to be a bit critical of ""Louisiana Kitchen "" places outside of the bayous of South Louisiana but these guys pretty much got it right. nThe bourbon friend chicken w gumbo yaya was really quite good. They don't overdo the spices but the flavor is still strong. nThe atmosphere is a little bit dive y but overall, we really enjoyed it.",2
"Such a regret. The host treated us as were an unconvinced to this restaurant. Negative behavior from all the staff and restrictions all the way. My friends group of 3 walked to the bar, and asked for a drink the host moved us to the patio because we didn't had a reservation. We were the only ones at the patio and it took 20 min for a waitress to come out and take our order.",1
"Wouldn't honor an in store coupon that I left at home that they told me they knew was valid, then informed me they couldn't take an online coupon that I presented on my phone from a reputable coupon site. Suggested I make my purchases then return with my receipt and coupon to receive my discount. nThanks for making things convenient. I'll do my shopping online from now.",1
No stars. Got a pedi. She filed more of my toe thaail. She clipped so much cuticle I completely took my foot away because ouch means nothing. She scrubbed one heal and the ball of the other foot. I asked why she just acted like I was invisible. I guess when you wait til the last minute you can't complain too much. But this place gets worse with time. Shut it down already.,1
"our waiter was awesome! i had the steak fajitas and they were totally over priced at 18 but some of the best fajitas ive ever had! i didn't eat any of the sides or tortillas because the meat portion was so large and that was my favorite part. n that's what she said! nthis is a fox concept i will happily, HAPPILY go to. scrumptious.",2
"This place serves traditional Mexican street food and it is freaking fantastic! We had fish, steak, chorizo, and barbacoa tacos and all were super fresh and delicious. Tacos are only about 2 each! It's great to have this place in our area, it's a nice break from the slew of Americanized Mexican restaurants. The owners are very nice, we will definitely be back.",2
"This coffeeshop is always filled up with a young crowd. Yummy and fresh pastries, delicious latte, great iced latte, convenient location. Inspiring. I like to go there since it has a good location, and work on my stuff during a few hours and just enjoy the moment. Staff is very friendly and courteous.",2
"Was taken to this little hidden treasure by a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised. Their menu options were all very tempting but I have to rave about the brisket sandwich that I ordered. All of the ingredients were very fresh and flavorful. If you are looking for some great food in a laid back atmosphere, I definitely recommend stopping in here.",2
Pleasantly surprised! Chilean sea bass as well as both of the tarts were wonderful. We brought our two and six year old along and they were extremely accommodating. Great dishes with the exception of one of the salads which was a bit over salted. The place itself is very quaint and the host was warm and understanding of our children and their needs for crayons and such. Would love to return.,2
"Staff is nice. Facilities need updating and a good scrub. Services were fine, okay. Massage therapist was noisy as she moved around the room, talked too much explaining essential oils throughout the treatment and generally could use refinement of technique. Facial was good not great. I hope money and training is invested here. I absolutely love coming and staying at the Biltmore every year.",1
"Usually stop by at least twice a week and last couple of times been an issue. Frosty no spoon, drink with combo no straw. I understand save where you can, but give me accessory to enjoy my meal. nToday got wrong order totally had to make u turn to get correct order and refunded difference. nHopefully with some extra training they will listen to customer reviews",1
"We came here tonight with friends for the Friday night fish fry. It was the most horrible dinner. We sat there and waited for our meals for over an hour. Then when we got them, 1 of the fish fry's were still frozen inside and the other 3 were still raw. The waitress was really nice. They ended up comping our dinners.",1
"I used them again this season and my carpets look great. I live in RV resort with blacktop streets that track in on the carpet and it is a real problem. Also, I have white carpet that is a problem. I have been so pleased that I recommended them to 4 people and 3 used them and were very satisfied also. Justin is great.",2
"Vibrating walls AGAIN, music TOO LOUD. No free drinks or free bottle as was promised by our promoter. Total cock fest! TIP don't pay for an 8 small bottle of evian at the bar. Go outside the club don't forget a a hand stamp and head upstairs to the bar for a free glass of water. Really though, what club doesn't give free water?! PS pregnant mime dancers not cool, or sexy, or hip.",1
"Elephant Bar is nothing to write home about. I had lunch there with some coworkers. The soup and sandwich I had was decent but nothing I couldn't have eaten at the local Panera. The one saving grace of this lunch was the crispy green bean appetizer, which was actually quite delicious. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",1
"The Muddy Cup is a refreshing change from all the chain stores. There's a friendly community feel to the room and they have wonderful coffee and a great selection of teas. I spoke to the owner, and she was very friendly and enthusiastic. The food is wonderful, and there is an inviting feel to the place. I love this place!",2
"Used to come here for the carambar ice cream. Ordered it again to discover no trace of the carambar taste at all in it. I don't know what they are using now, but it's definitely not carambar. I have given them one star due to the dishonest menu description. They didn't seem particularly phased when we pointed out this problem either.",1
"Went here on Tuesday night. The venue is beautiful and busy. Security entrance was fine. Bottle service was horrible. Ordered 4 bottles and hardly ever saw our cocktailer Tatiana. As cute as she is, the service was just poor. I had to go to the bar myself to ask for clean cups and bring the dirty ones. Maybe she was overwhelmed, not sure but for a Vegas nightclub, not what I'm used to.",1
I called them on Monday at 1 00 and asked that the come look at my damage in order to give me an estimate. They said they'd be there Tuesday. I called Wednesday to follow up since I had not heard from them. They said they had not been able to get to my house and would not be able to come until the next week. a full week after I initially called. That's not what I call good customer service!,1
"Matt did an electric car charger disconnection for us and was superb. He arrived promptly, was courteous and professional, had a great attitude, and got the job done quickly and efficiently. His standard service charge is absolutely worth it, and if we were staying in the area, I would absolutely use him again. Highly recommended.",2
"Food is decent, well seasoned. The server was great! However, the meat took forever to come out, and when it did, not a good selection of meat. Our server was kind enough to have the ""meat guys "" come our way, but again, I only got to try 3 different kinds of meat, plus roasted pineapple. I'll stick to my usual Brazilian steakhouses in back my hometown.",1
"Random find for a tapas place, but they have the best steak I have ever had. And for 20 with fries and dipping aioli you can't beat the price. The steak is topped blue cheeses crumbles and it's tender and perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend was not a fan of this place until he tried their sirloin. I have been on a search to find a steak better than theirs' and I haven't found it yet!",2
"Food was amazing but the service was horrible! I would suggest to take out don't dine in. I ordered the eggs Benedict, instead of Canadian bacon, they put crispy bacon on it served it with hash browns and a salad with a balsamic vinegarette. The two girl working there were so unprofessional from their interaction to the attire.",1
Arizona Brothers sent a 3 man crew to take care of my recent move from a house to an apartment. They made a difficult day so much more tolerable. They were kind and friendly and worked hard and fast. They were very careful with my furniture and with my freshly painted apt walls. I recommend Arizona Brothers highly!,2
"If I could give zero stars I would. This company came recommended to me by my apt complex. I made an appointment TWICE and they didn't show up TWICE. After the first time, they were so apologetic saying this never happens, so I decided to give them another chance purely off the convenience of not having to call another company and they didn't show up AGAIN. Forget it! Don't waste your time!",1
"Sat down for breakfast, a huge grasshopper, size of a iphone jumped near our table, waitress took care of it and said oh, we get a lot of these but none this big. Just gross, how many grasshoppers is normal at breakfast? Then a huge moth flew by . gross just gross . Only highlight were the syrupy pancakes .",1
"Worst experience ever! Customer service poor have no idea about what should they know, the manager was despotic, caotic and mean, they charged us for a nonexistent warranty, when we asked for a solution everybody was rude, but again, the manager is the worst, shouting orders and paying no attention to my.",1
Love the happy hour. Courtney is the best bar tender and will take very good care of you even if the bar is full. Megan is awesome as well. Cant go wrong with that pair. Food is always fantastic. Besides great happy hour specials the regular menu is just as equally good. And sweet potato fries mmmmmm need I say more. I love all the PTs in town but love this one the best.,2
This is the worst disorganized Starbucks I have ever gone to in the afternoons. Lots of employees who don't go out of their way to move rapidly or at all two registers and one untrained staff member working. Definitely need some supervision or management there after 2 00pm. Will never go there again after three attempts.,1
"This place is HUGE! Apparently, it's one of the largest outdoor mall in the U.S. I've been coming here for many years and everytime I stop in I MUST check out FCUK, but it's closed down! So sad. I did go to the FCUK in the Fashion Show Mall, but it's just not the same. Many top ends store here and a awesome Hookah kiosk which almost suckered me into buying a Hookah.",2
"The front desk lady was very nice checking in went by smoothly! The beds here are sooo comfortable. I slept like a baby! Prices aren't that bad either and the hotel is pretty nice as well. Service isn't that great though. We had to ask twice to get some extra towels. Oh well. All I did here was sleep, shower, recover, and gamble so that's all I can comment on.",2
"5 stars, nuff said! Just check this place out. Food and customer service was top notch. They're still taking people in and accepting new orders 5 mins till closing. Owner was so nice that he gave us free green tea ice cream for coming in. Sushi rolls looked and tasted fresh. Definitely coming back and supporting this local hub",2
"WHEW Sweet Baby Jesus! The food here was amazing! I wont lie after eating at the one in The Plaza I was a little turned off by their food. However after some convincing I am glad I made this trip! I got the Andy's Fried Chicken Benedict. MOUTH WATERING! The mashed potatoes were amazing, The biscuits soft, the chicken juicy and crispy! Just amazing!",2
"I ate here today. I ordered a ""Mediterranean "" wrap. It was okay, except for the fact that I had to send it back and have it remade due to the 3 curly brown hairs adorning it as a garnish. That was pretty sick, but the staff was really nice and I liked the fact that they had low calorie options. All in all, it is a commercial space, nothing unique, but a decent place for a casual lunch.",1
"This review is for pet hotel portion. I dropped off my dog hear so we can enjoy the holiday weekend. Now my dog has fleas and diarreah. It took over 30 minutes to check him out, I'm thinking they had to wash the filth off my dog, which it didn't help because he smelled like poop. I recommend dropping your dog off to Petsmart instead.",1
"on Thursday the 15th of August at approximately 8 30 pm I placed an order of about a dozen burgers for my pee wee football team and I was short on my order, .I guess counting burgers isn't a part of customer service now at days, maybe a little basic math course should be included in the hiring process?",1
"Wife's b day and she saw this on tanked, we both wanted to see the jellyfish tank so we went, 70 to get in with a couple drinks is steep and the place is very small. Cool that everything is made of ice, even the drink glasses but nothing to do really and the jellyfish tank wasn't there? The bar tender said it was only there for 3 months? Oh well, we just wasted 70 and a half hour. Won't be back.",1
"We had the chicken burrito chimi style. Wasn't bad.the steak was obviously roasted and was in chunks, not shredded. The beans and rice were good.the rice wasn't dry like most places. Was disappointed our takeout did not include any salsa. Don't most Mexican joints give you salsa when you take out? Guess you have to order it. Wi try it again but will order something different.",2
"This place bothers me. I already everything about country so going to these kind of places freaks me out. I was forced to go here because the boyfriends parents were in town and they choose Cadillac Ranch due to their type of ""cuisine "". I have to say the foo d wasn't bad. Server messed up my order but when they got it right it was ok. I will not go here again however. Sorry.",1
We stayed at the HRH Paradise Tower Sunday and Monday nights and liked it a lot. We did wander off to other more extravagant hotels to play but felt most at home at the HRH and the machines paid better. I had a great time entering a Texas Holdem Tournament which lasted a long time for just a 60 buy in. Good food and service at the Pink Taco and the hotel staff were all very friendly.,2
"All we tried were the Deep Fried Cajun Pickles.well they were not crispy and they had no flavor, the remoulade sauce they recommended was no help. The staff was nice.it took longer than expected just for the pickles. Price was good and so was the amount we got but I won't get the pickles if we belly up to their truck again.",1
We had a reservation for a car and waited for half a day. Their policy of doing a credit check along with only allowing the person to drive that did the credit check is stupid and we were not told that over the phone. This ruined and cancelled our desperately needed trip for a job interview in Los angeles. And their price wasn't even cheap like they said. I wont ever use this company.,1
"It's a ways off the freeway to stop regularly, but we were glad we did. The prices are very reasonable and the portions large for lunch. I had the chicken caesar salad. The strips of chicken were nicely grilled and very thick. Chopped eggs and tomatoes added to the dish. Husband ordered the chicken bruchetta and talked about the blended flavors for hours afterwards. He is so not a foodie ",2
"Service is never the best here, but they have good clean flank salad great happy hour prices. Martinis smaller, but for 5 you can have two! Great Queso dip that is half off until 7. Great patio if you can tolerate smokers or music playing on stage. When it's good it's good, but when it's bad it's BAD!",1
"Elliot is amazing! My right back has been bothering for the past week and I was getting tingling shooting sensation to my right elbow. With one 30 minute cupping therapy session, the tingling feeling went away! Elliot knows what he's doing and im truly blessed to come across his massage and cupping therapy work!",2
"Our friend was staying at MGM this week so we met her for a quick meal here at Wolf Gang Puck. I am giving it a four stars due to the pizza, fries and mac and cheese being wonderful. Would have given it a 5 but our waiter was AWFUL. Guy looked like a complete Bro and totally did not want to be there.",2
"Loved this place. Called for some carry out at the last minute. I am staying at a nearby hotel, and they were super accommodating. Got there a few minutes early to pick up. Offered a seat and some water. Then, the owner came by to introduce herself. Great, beautiful woman! Talked for a while and really enjoyed meeting. Great experience!",2
"My husband the carnivore, LOVED this place. He said the meat was smoked and tender and just amazing. There's a long line to eat inside the restaurant, but the take out line is short and you can grab a stool by the counter and eat there as well. Excellent quality and soft and juicy strips keep you well fed in the cold!",2
"Terrific spot with great vibe. The iced coffee is one of my favorites being cold brewed, smooth and delicious. The Americano is also fantastic if you desire a bit less caffeine. Sandwiches are very good but the stars of the program are the pumpkin bread, banana bread, blueberry breakfast cake, and assorted pastry items! Outstanding spot to regroup late in the day too.",2
"This is a good park, its small but fast. There is an anti graffiti coating on the concrete that makes for a unique surface to ride on. I wouldn't go as far to say it is slick but it takes less lateral force to throw wheel slides and they go a bit further. Watch out there are kids, but don't sweat it kids have more resiliency than you'd think.",2
"2 hours to get a pizza on a weekday evening because they somehow lost my online order. When it did arrive, it was greasy and flavorless. The sauce was bland and canned crap. An extra star because my delivery driver was nice, but there's really too many better options Salvatore's Tomato Pies, Ian's, Glass Nickel. Pizza di Roma in Madison to eat this crap.",1
Assistants seem like they dont know what they're doing. They had to do my xrays over and over again coz they cant do it right. Dr. pham is nice but very rough. Had a crown down and it was painful as hell! Did not explain the procedure well and didnt give me other options. Changed my dentist since then and never ever going back!,1
"Loved it! No cafeteria style dining as mentioned in earlier reviews, they are now a regular sit down and be waited on place. Great music playing, delicious food and friendly waitstaff. Will definitely eat here agaiext time we come to Vegas. Mac n cheese was so good along with the brisket. Also 2 for 1 drafts with stay at Excalibur.",2
"I usually LOVE Carl's JR Chicken Tenders. This place is awful. The tenders are over cooked, they messed up my order Iordered 20 Tenders for me and the kids. We got 10 pieces and they are awful. And their website is broken so I can't post an email to them either. If I could do 0 stars right now. GRRRRRRRRRRRR",1
The service and prices here were good. My room was nicer than most Residence Inns. I got a late check out which I needed as I was battling a flu and needed to rest through the morning before I got going. I told the maid on day one that the drain in my shower was slow and I was pleased to see they fixed that problem.,2
"I never considered myself a fan of indian food until I went here. we experienced great service the moment we walked in the door. I am big on service, if you have great food and have bad service then you have bad food in my opinion, because I wont come back. I always seem to venture off on some sort of rant I was extremely impressed with all of the dishes we ordered. I will definitely go back. ",2
"this place is yummy! I've been craving a lobster roll ever since moving west from the east coast and the lobster roll here is delicious! Their lobster mac n cheese is also VERY good. Their cajun garlic fries are soooo good and just the right amount of crispy. Relatively expensive, but then again, it's Vegas and it's lobster.",2
"Way too crowded, and not intimate at all with tables practically stacked one right over the other. If you don't have a laptop, then you will feel really awkward. The only nice thing is when it's sunny outside and you can sit on the patio with the sunflower garden they have. The coffee is mediocre. For better drinks, go down 2 blocks to Te Cafe or Crazy Mocha.",1
"This is a great breakfast place. Beware, the food is really big, easily shared. I have gotten the Croque Monsieur twice now. It is delicious. My husband gets the French toast. I highly recommend this place. It does get busy though. They are really good about getting your food out in a timely manner, even if it is packed.",2
"I went here based off reviews. But Sunday during brunch may not have been the most ideal time. The place was hot and muggy. The food was edible, but not to my standards of the good salvadorean food I am use to in Seattle. Beans were runny. Pupusas super greasy. Pork over fried. Not the best quality. Service was polite yet minimal. Will stick to my Salvadorean place back in West Seattle.",1
Ok . This place is just alright. Nothing special. There pizza sauce needs help. There crust looked and tasted OK. But there a 3 special ingredients missing in there tomato sauce. The waiter was not enthused when I asked what is popular on the menu. The antipasta board was not good. This place needs Gordon Ramsay's help seriously,1
"Had a terrible first experience at this place. I arrived at the store 10 minuets before closing time. Employee was a young male and EXTREMELY rude. He locked the door 5 mins before closing time to prevent any more customers from coming in. As soon as we got our food and sat down, the employee rudely asked us to leave at 8 07. Never going back to that store again.",1
"What a fantastic place! This was my first time and certainly not my last. Tacos are so tasty and enchiladas chicken and ground beef were YUMMY. Their chips and salsa are also good! The service was top notch. In fact, it made my day. It was great to sit out on the patio with a cold beer and not feel rushed. Looking forward to another great meal there!",2
I was referred to Clarissa Boutique by a friend. The ladies were pleasant and helped me pick out perfect earrings and bracelet to match my dress and crystals on the neckline. The prices were very reasonable. They even sent me a handwritten thank you note in the mail. I will definitely refer friends!,2
"Bought tix to ""O "" and got there too late to eat at a normal sit down place. Was looking for a cafe and found Gelato. Many people eating and some were in bathing suits cause it's close to the pool. Grabbed a panini and green bean salad. It was delicious and tasted very fresh. A little pricey but worth it.",2
"My fiance' I love coming in here when were in Vegas on our last day here for breakfast before we make our 4 hour long drive back home to Cali. There's always a wait but definitely worth it. I've never tried any of their food except for breakfast, but they give you big portions and it's so good. Definitely a place to check out when you're at Vegas.",2
"Love this place excellent food, and you can watch them cook it what restaurant lets you do this? . Crab puffs are magnificent, light and not greasy. Staff are friendly, and I've been a fan for years. I ordered 50 egg rolls for a party, and they were fantastic, and reasonably priced. nI highly recommend them. No MSG and not much overhead so quality food at good prices.",2
"The french toast was fun! It was a baquette bread dipped in vanilla custard. I just read a review that mentioned dipping it into the syrup and I'm going to try that next time. nI also had a bite of the chocolate chip cookie that was soft and had a good flavor to it. nThe menu was also helpful in identifying foods that travel well, in case you want to take your order to go.",2
Not sure about all the hubbub. The samples were nice but the food didn't do anything special for me. The cookies at the end were delightful. I'm not sure that Chinese and Mexican belong together. My husband liked the relleno but wasn't wild about it. The people were all incredibly nice hence 2 stars.,1
"First time stopping in . Love breakfast joints like this but sad to say that on my first experience here was not a joyous one, do to the lack of enthusiasm from customer service and the food at best ! Was mediocre . I was stoked to try this place because of the reviews it has received and the pics of the food looked delish . Maybe just an off day .",1
"As longtime Vegas residents, we used to really like this place. It's gone downhill. Kind of depressing ambience, I mean there's a difference betweeot lavishly decorated and just plain blah. The food wasn't great, and we were very disappointed in the processed faux guacamole we got for five bucks that was advertised as fresh made.",1
This is the place to hang out for young hipsters. Ilove the restaurants here. I love the gambling here. I love the people here. its just great to be in a part of Vegas where you aren't outnumbered by senior citizens and families of 10. No offense to either but they don't exactly fit into my image of what I want to see on my Vegas vacation.,2
"It's in a strip mall the decor is better than expected, but the food is perfectly stripmall ish. I would be very, very afraid to know the ingredients in what I just consumed. Have no idea why so many people have rated this a 4 .why are our standards so low?!? The one plus was the service. Very friendly, fast and efficient.",1
 EDITED I used to be a regular and a big fan of this place loved the food and the service. I was really disappointed in my last visit though. The guy was in charge was so rude to us it felt like he was almost gonna tell me to leave! Although i was really hungry I just ended up having an appetizer Which I did not enjoy I just wnted to leave the place. Never going back.,1
"Overpriced and nothing special. nMy 15 margarita came in a small cafeteria style glass with barely any liquor, definitely not enough to get me lit. The 10 beer helped a little. One bite of my 20 burger made me regret even getting food. nNext time I get the option to go to Margaritaville, I'm choosing AA instead.",1
"The Waterfront is a great place to go for shopping, food, and fun. It is a great outdoor mall, and if it is a nice day outside, there is not place better to be for shopping. It is a fantastic outdoor area that is perfect to have a great day with your family to walk around. Not to mention, there is a Starbucks right in the center of the plaza!",2
"I've been to a lot of hookah bars, and this one was quite easily the worst. The service was ridiculously slow, and the hookah tasted kinda funky. I ordered some Moroccan mint iced tea that was strange tasting as well. Luckily, the diet coke I ordered to replace the mint iced tea was normal. Though I'm not sure what other options there are for hookah in Vegas, I would recommend avoiding this place.",1
"5 dollar tables and beer pong? Count me in! Osheas is conveniently located on the strip. The atmosphere is not pompous like the newer casinos, but is very fun and rowdy with a great mix of people. PROTIP Make the trek out here if you can, one of the casino dealers informed me that Oshea's would be closing within the next two years so they can build something new.",2
"Perfect place in the Ballentyne Village to grab a quick healthy lunch. They display the calories right on the menu so you can do good with out much effort. I've had their chicken slouvaki small pita hold the onions , and their veggie pita, both very good. Perfect and guiltless. Ask for their frequent card!",2
"Came in cause the AC went out, they got it fixed.2 months later my AC went out again. Took it back to Wilhelm and the took care of it, AC is back and just as good as new. Just want to thank Wilhelm for backing up their warranty no hidden or extra charges. Wilhelm held up there end of the bargain. nThanks again.Wilhelm",2
"Sadly I must say the food is not as good as it used to be and service is lacking. Bacon was cool and undercooked, potatoes were dry and over cooked. We had come here before and food was excellent however this time was a completely opposite experience. A note on the service. I spilled a glass of water before we rec'd our food and the entire spilled mess remained on our table for the entire meal!",1
"The place is perfect for families looking for a fun place to eat on a budget. The food was great for the price and it had a great atmosphere. The staff was very attentive, kind, and friendly and that's all I ask for. The restaurant doesn't WOW you strictly by the food, but overall it's a great place for a casual dinner in the New York, New York hotel. I would suggest this place to friends!",2
"Nothing special. Very local. I had a beer and a burger. nI came in for lunch and the bartender was unfriendly at first as she didn't recognize me as a regular. The guys at the bar we friendly and we struck up a conversation. After the bartender saw I was ""accepted "" by the locals she became more friendly. I'd recommend something else if you're not from around these parts ",1
Perfect atmosphere on the patio and excellent food. We just wanted a light bite so we ordered a half dozen different tacos and some pico de gallo with shrimp and avocado. not sure what it was called? We loved every bit of it. The service was great. Friendly and walked us through the menu. I highly recommend Barrio Queen! We'll be back soon!,2
"This place is a MUST VISIT for cheap, tasty and fresh macarons and more. I love the assortment of flavors and have tried some I haven't seen before such as cr u00e8me br u00fbl u00e9e! There are 22 flavors in total wow! ranging from lavender blueberry to Madagascar vanilla. This small shop, with unfortunately limited seating, offers many sweets that could also be packed to go.",2
"The hubby and I moved here from Chicagoland and we really missed Jimmy Johns when we first moved here. We were thrilled when they started showing up in Arizona finally. This has become our normal place for a quick lunch while we are out running errands. We were there on a Wednesday afternoon and yes, it was packed but we were still able to find a table inside and the service was fast and friendly.",2
It was my first time in Lindo Michoacan and the service was excellent. Our order was taken promptly and food came out quickly.The waiter stop by often to check in with us.The food taste so good I was surprised that they make fresh guacamole if you wanted some. Overall this place was really good and I would defiantly go back again. ,2
"If you have been to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in LA. Well welcome to Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles in Phoenix. The chicken is off the chain,waffles are yummy. The family ate small bowls of Mac and cheese and rice over red beans and cheese grits. It was all good. Can't wait to come back for some more chicken and I want get my hands on some shrimp and grits",2
"With all the hype, I truly thought this place would have better food. The burgers were nothing special and quite thin. The super thin fries were annoying and my cookies n cream milkshake was a vanilla shake with some cookie crumbs on top. This location might do ok only because its right in the middle of Mill Ave.",1
"WORST PLACE EVER, they sent me a bill the other day for 200 dollars from 8 months ago. They never looked into what my insurance would or would not cover and just screwed me over. Do not go here they are sales men and crooks and will give you an unnecessary hearing test and charge you for it, I'm 29 don't need a hearing test. AVOID at all Costs should really be 0 stars.",1
"I hate to write negative reviews, but this was an awful hotel. The staff was great and responsive, but the property is decrepit and Ramada needs to figure out a way to update this property. I stayed at this hotel over the Democratic Convention and though convenient, I would never stay at this place again. This is out of date property that should be classified as a motel 6 not a Ramada.",1
"I had bought a groupon while back, placed an order, and they NEVER DELIVERED the cupcakes! They cupcakes were for a party, so I called and called them frantically, left messages, and got NO RESPONSE! They never called back, no apologies or acknowledgement of any kind. So I called Groupon and have my money refunded. I urge you all to stay away and take your business elsewhere!",1
"This place is amazing, GF and I went for dinner and we got a half and half small soup and half a sanwich . It was PERFECT, I was very satisfied after eating it. I want to try the breakfast also but It's tough getting up for it haha! I haven't tried any pastries because its a little far for me to go get a cupcake to try P. if I do ill update this review",2
"We walked in and half the restaurant was empty, was we were excited to get in right away.or so we THOUGHT. A 30 min wait with empty tables is never a good sign. I asked the hostess why and she said the kitchen was behind. No excuse in my book. That is bad customer service. Get more people helping know the kitchen then. They didn't get our service that night.",1
"This place is horrible. Depressing atmosphere, poor quality food, very small portions, but high prices. Flabby corn tortillas, very little filling tacos, burros, quesidillas , and barely warm. No chips available on weekdays. Ordered items with pork and was told it was ""spoiled. "" I can't believe this place stays in business!",1
"So as we all know, North Las Vegas is starving for restaurants. I was so excited to see something new come to our side. The service was AWESOME. This crew is amazing and positive and friendly. The food however was well, just ok. Compare it to a Dennys or IHOP, just with bigger portions. Will I go again, probably. Will I expect to be wowed, probably not.",1
"Called to find a chair I really liked on their website, but the person couldn't find it on her ""price sheet "" so she said that probably meant it was discontinued. Price sheet? Really? In 2014? For the life of me I can't understand why this company is still around without offering ANY prices on their website. Very frustrating shopping experience. I have no desire to visit their store.",1
"The food is excellent and the best part of the restaurant is that the patio is opeow! Well that may not be the best part, but it is a welcome addition. The fish tacos are the best I've had and you can't go wrong with the dollar tacos. If you're feeling adventurous, order a cabeza taco. It's awesome and after all for a dollar, what do you have to lose.",2
"Eaten there several times been sick feeling after 3 of them. Not a clean place, service is slow and with the exception of a few beer specials the menu is overpriced 8 for a dozen overcooked wings? Had hope for them to get better after they remodeled about a year ago but I won't be giving them another chance.",1
"Hands down, the worst dry cleaning I've ever encountered. They managed to make my 900 suit look like it was purchased from Kmart. The suit came back with more wrinkles in it than when it was turned in and its now covered in hair and lint. Oh and they managed to double up on the pleats on the front of one of the legs, so I now have railroad tracks. Avoid this establishment at all costs.",1
"Came to Lolos Sunday morning. First time coming here I expected great service and amazing food. Service was really poor and the wait was super long not only did they take about 30 min to sit us our food took over 40 min to come out after ordered, not once did we get an apology! As for the food it was ok! Coming from working in a restaurant environment customer service should def be a top priority.",1
"Hard to add much new to the reviews other than if you want a good NY style steak at the NY NY casino this is the place. Good service, well made drinks and of course expensive but what NY style steak house is not? Have been here several times, never had anything other than steak so cannot comment on the few other choices.",2
"OMG I wish we had gone here a long time ago. This is an Italian restaurant sports bar combo that fires on all cylinders. Service, menu selection, food quality and quantity.all top notch. The burger sliders were to die for, along with the sweet potato fries. How many sports bars offer sweet potato fries? Can't wait to return and try the pizza or calzone.",2
"I used to work near Royal Gyros and went frequently for lunch. The owners are super nice and the food is great. He even brought some free lentil soup over a few times. Don't let the underwhelming exterior fool you, this food is delicious. Plus, there were always these same 2 dudes sitting at the front of the place reading newspapers, being awesome. I want to be those guys.",2
"So good! We stopped in for a couple scoops of ice cream and were not disappointed. The toasted coconut is delicious. It's creamy, flavorful, and I thought the serving size was fair. The Vietnamese coffee was also great. If you're a coffee fan, I highly suggest trying it. The shop is really cute with lots of candy for sale. I will definitely be back to try other flavors.",2
"This office has too many patients it is very hard to get a non emergency appointment in the same month. I needed to reschedule an appointment, due to a work emergency, and they could not see me for another month. Not everyone works a perfect 9 5 predictable schedule, some compassion and flexibility would be appreciated. I will be finding a new doctor.",1
This place is awesome. Everyone was super friendly and the games are way fun. A tip go early in the day and with a group of friends. It's not nearly as busy and when you split it up it's very affordable. Still no drivers allowed but that's okay. The range is only about 215 yards long so hitting the targets doesn't need a lot of power. I can't wait to go back!,2
"This place is horrific! The one star is only for the barista Jenny. She is the sweetest thing,makes amazing drinks, and will make up yummy drinks for you. But if she is not there.your fraps will have chunks of ice in it and your hot beverages will be NASTY. DONT GO HERE. I prefer the Starbucks in the Centennial plaza near Walmart.",1
"Biggest RIP OFF store in Vegas. Store sells part for 31.29,web site says 13.19. Call and talk to mgr. and he says he'll match it and I ask if I should bring the part in and he says no. So I put in the part and when I return for the refund he says no I sold you the manufactures part and not theirs. Basic bait and switch. We'll Never shop there again. NPS from now on",1
We had a party there for 28 people and they charged our debit card twice for the bill and admitted they made the mistake and have not returned the money. It is close to 500. No one in the accounting department will call us back and the restaurant first told us it is just a hold and now we have over draft notices. They are a nightmare .,1
"Went here after an Ignite Phoenix event and had a fantastic time with friends on the balcony upstairs. Ate some ridiculously tasty Animal Fries and had several drinks. Everyone in our party got their food very fast, and it was all quite good. Not sure I'd care for the indoor restaurant area ambiance, but the patio and balcony were great and I'd definitely return!",2
Best Authentic Italian in Vegas! Heard about it from friends and on Food Network. Great atmosphere super attentive and friendly wait staff. Their lasagna scampi are out of this world on occasion they have different chefs specials from time to time. Have been 10 plus times now looking forward to many more.,2
"Yeah, this was an entertainingly crappy place to be. I can honestly say without sadness that I may never in my years to come, no matter how few or how numerous they may be, step into this place again. Nor will I think about it. No memories of its goodness or badness will stay with me. Except the really hammered dancing chick and her friend with the leg cast. And the dude doing the worm. yeah.",1
"A client in Vegas asked if I could meet again for lunch. Given my dislike of the first experience at dinner, I was really hesitant to come back. Maybe the second time was the charm, as the tortilla soup and sweet corn tamales hit all the right notes this trip, and the guacamole was very fresh, striking the right balance between creamy and chunky.",1
I went last night with my good friend for a drink there. We were mortified to see that the price of their 2 for 1 special was 12 for 2 glasses of Molson. I don't mind paying that kind of money on beer but is has to be better than that. I really doubt that I will ever come back to SKy considering how expensive cheap products are there.,1
"Searched Yelp for a Taco Tuesday and found Christina's. 1.25 for a taco and very tasty. Ordered 4 shredded beef tacos and a soda for 6.50. Absolutely great red salsa, the green was heavy garlic but the red hit all the right buttons. Chips brought out as a first made this place a step above a hole in the wall at great value. I'll be back",2
"I have tried a lot of dry cleaners good ones are hard to find, and this is a good one. They have 1.35 men's shirts, they do everything on premise and the staff are friendly. I moved about 10 miles from here, and still find myself driving all that way as I havent found anything near my new place that's as good for the money. BOTTOM LINE Drop 'em off dirty. Pick 'em up clean.",2
"Chewy lobster and pathetic sides is not my idea of a good meal. The ""red "" potatoes were boiled whole, until they were no longer red and then plopped on the plate with a few sogged out Brussels sprouts. We got my son the ""coconut "" shrimp but it didn't have any coconut! Must have run out? But they didn't tell us. Save your money, go somewhere else.",1
I have been coming here since this place opened and I know they have been sold but they still do a great all around job. Great Happy Hour and good consistent food served for lunch and dinners. Happy Hour has great food and drinks specials and gets pretty busy on Thurs and Friday. nA good spot to come if you are at the Fashion Square.,2
You can't go to Pittsburgh and not get Primanti Bros. For my fellow Detroiters it's like not going to Coney Island when friends are in town. Sandwiches are great all of them come with coleslaw and frenchfries ON the sandwich . They have a full bar at this location. It was in the high 80's with high humidity so a Blue Moon went perfect with our meals.,2
With steakhouses all over Vegas there are much better choices out there. Had the bone in rib eye that came overcooked and very bland. The seafood appetizer platter was unique but the taste was just not there. I just think there are much better steakhouses in the valley area. It's hard after having a bad experience to want to drop another several 100 on dinner.,1
"I've been here twice and both times were amazing. The difference between both visits was the lighting. I actually do like to see my food so if L'Etoile can refrain from dimming the lights, it's much appreciated! I know some folks like the romantic setting but seriously, it's all about the food and I would like to see it to appreciate it.",2
"Overpriced and over rated If you had 30 worth of Kobe beef would you smother it in mayo and syrupy barbecue sauce? Quivey does, and it's a good thing to, because it's the worst kind of nasty that I have tasted. If your are looking for an excess of pretension with a complete lack of quality that is significantly over priced, look no further.",1
"The new ownership has definitely NOT made Aliante a better place. I used to win a lot more when it was run by Station Casinos. The new membership has a lot less perks and it's harder to build up points. Closing the poker room was a major low point, but one of many. Such a shame because the new ownership could've made a great name for themselves if the transition was a good thing.",1
I've been taking my dog to Dr. Brian Hammes for over 9 years. He always takes great care of my dog. He's extremely knowledgeable and has earned my trust years ago with the care he takes for my dog. nToni is always friendly and helpful with scheduling and checkups. nI'd recommend Buffalo Alta Animal Hospital to anyone who cares about their pets!,2
"So we took a party of 17 here tonight on Election Day for a trade show. It took about 25 mins to get wine after we ordered. Appetizers were slow to be served, and he whole pace of service was lacking. One waiter tried to accommodate, but they really needed two. Management failure. Some decent food, but poorly handled.",1
"Too bad this place is not a secret! nHowever it is a hidden gem at the cosmopolitan. The line looks long, but moves quick! I only had a chance to try the white cheese pizza. Wished I had room for pepperoni! nI believe it's cottage cheese on top of this pizza. And I'm not a cottage cheese person at all! Nice thin crust. This is one my top 5 places for piazza!",2
"This was the worst experience possible. We went for my bachelorette party and prepaid to get an open bar, needless to say we paid for it and didn't get it. When asked about it staff and managers had every excuse but no answers and wouldn't mKe the situation right. Would highly not recommend. Not worth the price and they are just trying to take more money than is paid for.",1
"Took my father here for his birthday and to participate in restaurant week. Six dollars of each meal was donated to Three Square. The three course meal was delicious, pops was quite please with his meal, and they even remembered it was his birthday from making the reservation and put a candle in his dessert. Awesome food and ambiance. I'm a fan.",2
"Amazing. Food gasm. Thomas effing Keller to the rescue. Words cannot describe my experience at Bouchon. I had the chicken, for god's sakes, and it was INCREDIBLE. The baguette? Like I had in Paris yep, threw in the pretentious Paris card . Even the butter was amazing. Ended the meal with the lemon tart and could have died I was so happy. Do yourself a favor go to Bouchon. Just go.",2
"I wouldn't know how it is, since I'm here for the weekend and they are only taking reservations for locals. I can't come from out of town and spend my money at your restaurant? Okay then, I'll go across the street to Mesa Grill and have a great dining experience with outstanding service from people who are willing to accommodate out of town visitors.",1
Service was friendly. Noodles were overcooked. Seeing the kitchen workers slop food onto the prep plates like cafeteria workers was unappetizing. I think this kind of place should not have a view of the kitchen from outside while you're waiting for a table. Production line Chinese fusion done adequately.,1
"Don't bother going here , the promoters tells you their is a 20 open bar if u take their wristband. In fact you got to pay 30 dollars to get in and then still have to pay for your drinks and everytime you enter with a promoters band they get 5 10 dollars, so ofcourse it sounds good when they talking bullshit. nJust crap",1
"This place was pricy but hey, it's Vegas . The food was excellent! We all ordered the special, Beef Tenderloin which was cooked to perfection and full of flavor! We ordered a couple of appetizers. There were no complaints from any of us at our table of four. I am looking forward to the day i can return to Buchon.",2
"This hotel is definitely run down but it's also the cheapest hotel on the strip was one of the first ones to be built. There's fun games for the kids on the lower floor. The service was fine. However, I would recommend staying somewhere towards the middle of the strip because this is far from everything else.",1
"On time, friendly, great communication whether by email for the initial reservation or by txt once the journey with multiple stops began. Our driver was kind, smart and witty! You will be thankful if you use them! We had a group of 7 going to a high school graduation at ASU and dinner. Very pleased with the excellent service!",2
"I love sushi and have eaten all over the country but here in a little nothing town Maricopa, AZ is this awesome hole in the wall with great people. Great delicious fresh food with great service. My favorite is on daily special ""spicy tuna "", it is a must try. If you have people who think sushi is gross then their spicy or teriyaki chicken bowls are fantastic. Enjoy.",2
"Went here on Christmas day after church just to try it out. Food is what you'd expect, nothing special, nothing horrible. But, the service was atrociously slow. Waited 45 minutes before they took our order. Waitress was apologetic and very friendly, but maybe they were short handed because of the Holiday. Nonetheless, nothing would make me return here!",1
"Bad service, mediocre food, long long wait times. We specifically ask for wings before our meal because for some reason, servers think a person will enjoy their dinner to be cold sitting on a table while we eat an appetizer. Was no different here, waited 25 minutes for our appetizer and then receive our actual meal 2.5 minutes later, yeah I was being exact. What the french toast?!",1
"Totally love this place, until I forgot my purse in a cart, the teenagers working there just stared at me and said ""come back in an hour, it'll turn up "" didn't offer to help me look for it, take down my information, make an announcement around the store, nothing. Thankfully it was slow, so it was right where I left it. I won't be returning, I'll head down to the one on Charleston.",1
"Good food and service. Food is expensive. We stayed in the seafood catagory. Claims to have the best burger on the strip, don't know, didn't try it. I am not sure I will be back due to how expensive they were for the small portions. Too many good places in Las Vegas, one is Joe's Steak and Seafood which is a few steps away.",2
"People are right about this place! nService is aweful, they get upset if you don't order softdrinks! nTheir dim sum isnt great, and they recycle food, and leftover ndim sum is reserved to another sucker! nTHey also have a credit card minimum which is against the nmerchant credit card terminal agreement. Very unethical place!",1
"With high expectation from the reviews, I was really disappointed. For almost 40, there was nothing memorable. The food was just OK. One way to describe the Wynn buffet is style over substance. The dessert bar is a prime example. All the items were well presented but none tasted exceptional. Only if the food tasted as good as they looked, Wynn would be spectacular.",1
"I guess I should have asked for Rose. I tried this salon because my hairdresser moved and groupon had it on their website. Worst haircut of my life, I asked for two things.make sure I can still pull it back in a pony and make it all one length.didn't get either one right, one side is about a half inch shorter and won't stay back and she beveled the back instead of texturizing.",1
Everything started great. As soon as bartender realized I was routing for opposing team I got cut off. Absolutely insane. The black dude was the bartender. Which was a dick from the moment I walked in. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I know. If you want a good environment to watch a game there are plenty of other places to go around the area. Would never recommend phillys to anyone,1
"The pool is 5 stars. The Hole in the Wall has a great lunch menu. The restaurant has a great setting, is good for children families. When we ate there for dinner tonight I was really disappointed. It took so long for them to get our food out. My ribs were tough my husbands steak was really undercooked. We won't be back for dinner.",1
"I absolutely loved my cleaning service. Booking with Handy was super easy and took a lot of the pressure off in choosing a service. Danyell arrived early and, after going over the type of cleaning I needed, she got right to work. After she was done, my house smells fabulous and is SO clean! Danyell is the best and I'll definitely be asking for her again.",2
This place has improved greatly! The service has gotten better and store is much cleaner. They seem to have gotten rid of the slacker employees and the management is really focusing on customer service. Not a great deli or meat dept. and the whole store has been organized different. I can't see the reason for the placement of many products but I think it will take a while to get used to it.,2
"If you have a dog with you, as many people in Tempe do, don't go here. The employees and the manager here will turn you away on the basis that their drunk customers will mess with your dog. Do yourself a favor, take you and your dog to Handlebar, spend the same, or more ! , amount of money there because they will accommodate you and your pet with the amount of respect that you deserve.",1
"I was lured,to this place because of reviews. But it is a total sham. I ordered a bulgogi beef and it turns out just four small slices of beef on just white rise. If you are a super model try to keep your shape , you might like it. But no normal people pay 18 bucks just for a snack size beef on just F King white rice.",1
"seems to be a great little venue. Large selection of beer, could use a few more bathroom stalls, but can't really knock that. sound is good, acts are fresh, enjoy that that they bring in local's to open. would love if i could get a slice of pizza or something to nosh on before the show starts. but those are all minor complaints. will be back soon, wish more people in charlotte saw live music.",2
If this place is average it's only because you've lived in Arizona your whole life and have been spoiled by great Mexican food. They have the best salsa HANDS DOWN! The bean burro enchilada style is awesome and so is the green burro. It's old school though and not a hipster place. If you want solid Mexican food at a good price this is your place.,2
"Went in to check out down street from my hairdresser, sorry just a meh 2 star, kinda small and cheap costumes. I will stick with Buffalo Exchange or Rocket Resale. sorry really wanted to like store, but after looking I wasnt able to find something I had to have. Music played in store was good. Parking on side.",1
"Maybe it was late in the day, and maybe they'd just been supremely busy. I don't know what hit that place but it was filthy. Every table I attempted to sit at was covered in crud and crumbs and the floor was a sticky mess too even the staff looked disheveled and tired. The donuts were yum, bt wow, that place needs a deep clean.eurgh!",1
"Brought home some take out ribs. Figured I needed to do it quick because every other restaurant hat has been in this location has closed up not to long after opening. Have to say the ribs were meaty, the meat was tender, the sauce was tasty. Hope they stay in business long enough for a return visit.",2
"Amazing food. The vegetarian mini tacos are to live for! And if you aren't vegetarian, the buttermilk chicken melts in your mouth. Great service depends on what server you get. 5 stars for the food, 4 stars for the service the best server works at the bar most nights, I can't recall his name, sorry! ",2
"They have a wide assortment of a ton of different natural type things here. It's a bit far from where I live, but when I need something, I know I can count on them having it. Sometimes the prices are a little much, but I like that they are always helpful and friendly and consistently provide great support and service over the many years I've been coming here. And I will continue to come.",2
"Inside the LVH hotel, where the BF and I decided to grab a bite to eat before the D word musical, it's location is nearby Benihana's and a couple of other restaurants overlooking a waterfall and pond, with a marquee display of fireworks every hour? Very romantic, however the food was lackluster in flavor. Service was top notch and it did get pretty busy as the night wore on.",1
"I came here to see Jan Rouven and that's about it. I can't say too much about the hotel other than it just reeks of smoke and I had a major coughing fit. I'm not too sure I'd stay here. Honestly, it kind of looks like a dump.not to be mean. It looks a bit old school and nothing super fancy. Staff who work here are super nice 2 for staff .",1
"We can't wait to go back! We really felt like we were in New Orleans and the place was PACKED on a Friday night. If you can't handle spicy spicy, they will be happy to lessen the spice in the rue for you. PROS Shrimp creamy gouda cheese grits n Catfish creamy gouda cheese grits n Orange bowl salad n Sweet tea n Festive atmosphere n Grilled garlic bread CONS None yet.",2
"This was my fourth time and last going here. I liked their food but their customer service was HORRIBLE! Everyone, the greeter, the cashier and even the owner were rude. I dk if it was b c I had carry out or what it was but that was the last time they'll see me. I started this review on 3 9 2012. Sorry for the delay.",1
"Just ok. The place was drab and the food was fresh but no better than steak ums on my stove at home. Its only counter service but thats no reason for there to be not a smile in sight. The restrooms smell and I was compelled to hover and pray there wasn't a hidden video camera somewhere. At 25 for lunch for three, one shouldn't feel like they have to squat.",1
"Need a quick meal for lunch? Well Miracle Mile has your sandwich ready and on time. I was really fascinated by how fast I got my sandwich. They definitely had it down like a production line. My sandwich was okay.it's nothing to rave about. I think you could go to any small deli sandwich shop and get the same taste. However, like I said if you're on a rush eh.go for it!",1
"I ordered last week from Kam Wing. The menu contained very few vegetarian options and the only tofu plate offered used fish sauce. The tofu meal I tasted was alright neither too bad nor too good, but for the price you will definitely find better Asian cuisine in Montr u00e9al. An ""okay "" mark if you are looking for something average and are in the neighbourhood.",1
"My car 2006 Acura RSX was close to totaled and the following things needed to be replaced front bumper, fender, hood, right headlight, radiator system and condenser Service King worked with Geico and my car looks better than when I took it in. Josh kept me up to date with the progress ever 4 or 5 days. I would definitely recommend their work. See photo below",2
"Over cooked, dry, not enough sauce. What sauce we got was very generic n We were the only customers in the place she not got the order wrong. She was almost calling me a liar when she insisted that the ranch dressing was blue cheese and after examining it and realized she was wrong gave me more excuses instead of just getting me horrible watered down what they call blue cheese dressing.",1
"I needed 2 pairs of pants altered in a hurry so I looked on Yelp for a solid place by my house. I couldn't be happier with this place. The service, price and quality I received were excellent. My pants were ready at the date and time promised and there were no issues. I am glad to have found a great tailor close by and will definitely be back.",2
"Do not stay here if you drive. They claim about free parking but they actually meant you have to find your own street parking, which is impossible to find since everywhere is being restricted. Don't trust Expedia if you are going through them. They will just screw you over with their ""extremely kind "" attitude and customer service.",1
"My second favorite pizza close second, mind you in Phoenix. Great atmosphere, always crowded, and always delicious pizza and salads. I used to love their Pacifico pizza with shrimp, chorizo and goat cheese.mmmmmmm but regrettably it's not on their menu anymore. The sangria here is not bad either. Very friendly and attentive hosts servers, and casual yet fun decor.",2
After waiting for 30 mins for a table and another 40 for food we left when we were told It would be awhile for our food because the kitchen was so backed up. Many employees talking to customers but apparently none who can cook. None of the tables around us had food. Don't go unless you have a few hours to wait for a couple eggs.,1
"I don't understand what all the hype is about. My husband and I had the pizza and wings. Pizza was like something you get at a buffet or school cafeteria, nothing to write home about. The wings we ordered as extra crispy which were just that extra crispy, not very flavorful. One nice thing I would like to say is the server was polite and attentive. This was our first and last time coming here.",1
"So you walk in the restaurant a female worker kinda calls out with ""for here or to go "", not hello or anything that resembles a greeting to welcome you to their establishment. The customer service tonight was almost non existing, except for the male worker who at least checked on us seemed more personable. Thank goodness the food was good.",1
"Back in Chapel Hill there was a Bojangles two miles from my house, I move to Charlotte and its the same story. Its amazing that I am not fat because I have been eating the same Chicken tender dinner with large fries and iced tea for years. Bojangles is without a doubt, wings down the best fast food chicken place around.",2
"Get the gnocchi. The waitress described it as pillows of happiness and she is 100 correct. We went for a quick bite after a long week of work and it met all my wants. Quiet, friendly, comforting food. Will have to go back when I have time to relax with a cocktail and nosh board. That is what the neighboring tables were doing and it looked perfect.",2
"Not a great cafe for an art museum. I expected more but alas coffee was what I wanted and coffee is what I got. The guy working behind the counter didn't seem too enthusiastic about his job. Thankfully, the selection of food and drinks certainly made up for this. There isn't much else to say but if you're in the North Side of Pittsburgh, this may serve as one of the few coffee shops around.",1
I wanted to give this place 2 stars when I first walked in. The service wasn't good and I didn't see the appeal. Then I grabbed my hummus and it was delicious! And then I tasted heaven. I wasn't even in the mood for a milkshake but the adult birthday cake milkshake was amazing! I'm here on a Wednesday so I didn't experience the crowd. I highly recommend the milkshakes. Don't walk out without one!,2
Ive been coming to Barcelona Tapas Bar since it opened before they got their liquor licence . I'm glad i stumbled upon this little gem. I always get either the beef carpaccio or the tuna to start then i move my way up to the fillet Mignon MMMmmMMM and of course the capers MMMmMM their sangria is BOMB! They have all types of specials depending on the day of the week. I am def a regular here!,2
Super slow service. Don't come here. They had five people working on a Sunday morning. Zero people in the drive thru. Only one person was working the dine in customers with 8 people in line. Three workers were waiting for the drive thru line just talking and doing nothing. The exact same thing happened on Saturday as well.,1
"Just discovered this place today. In my opinion, it won't beat Cold Stone for the actual IceCream but the service was friendly, and personable, and the place has that old soda fountain feel, Even if it doesn't have the actual fountains. The Maciknaw Fudge Ice Cream in the fresh waffle cone was exactly what I wanted.",2
"I love the Brass Armadillo! As far as antique shops go, you can't get any better than this. The place is huge I could spend hours just looking at all of the neat stuff. The staff is awesome very friendly and helpful. I love the video game collections and the artwork. If you're in the area, check it out even if just to browse!",2
"Your classic Cheesecake Factory. All of the food items I've ever had here were good, exactly what you'd expect from the Cheesecake Factory. I love the location in Southside Works, close to shopping and other nightlife. The service has always been great here too. Overall, a good experience and I'll definitely be back.",2
"We have ordered pizza, wings, and salads from Godfather Pizza four times. The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious. The pizza and wings arrive hotter than any other pizza delivery service. We love the signature Clockwork Pizza and the medium wings. nSo glad they're so close and deliver so quickly. NOTE There's a 3.00 delivery charge and the driver doesn't receive that.so tip your driver!",2
Fantastic! nHad the green chilie pork once and the pork chimichanga another time. Great. nAnd the salsa was amazing! The green salsa was the best I've ever had.just something about it. And the second time not so much on the first the pico was awesome. nOne of the few things I found in Phoenix area worth writing home about!,2
"I am new to the area and was looking for somewhere local, affordable and convenient. I was very happy with my experience here today on a Thursday morning. They had a basic spa pedicure and I added the design and callus removal. I had a local flyer coupon. I would recommend this spot and intend to be back again soon.",2
Specifically dr sell and his team as well as the office has such an extreme lack of professionalism and work ethic. They don't even have the decency to take responsibility for their actions. I highly recommend to steer clear of this doctor and if you have a complaint don't even bother going to the office management they have no back bone and won't resolve your issue.,1
"Pricey! ouch! never paid this much for the same style dishes in SF but here is vegas and it is pricey no matter what restaurants you dine on the strip hotels. I am just glad that their Chinese food is authentic! I have been here couple times over the past few years their level of service and quality of food have been consistent, will keep coming back!",2
Note that I come to this branch around 8 30pm to 10pm every night for the past week. Lots of seating and I feel safe working alone here u3002 The only problem is the drinks I got a very diluted chai tea latte yesterday that I decided to order just Earl Grey tea tonight instead. Door says they close at 10pm but they don't kick people out before then,2
"Hidden away in the corner of a strip mall, Exclusive Tailoring is quite a find! I have tried different tailor's across the city and they are the best! You get the feeling that you are working with experts which is nice, especially since I have had an expensive suit butchered in the past by another shop. They gave a couple of my suits a great look and perfect fit.",2
"I ordered the shrimp grits . omg. my mouth was in heaven. It literally melted in my mouth. The appetizer breads, were also awesome ! everything is just awesome! nothing negative. It's so great you have to go for yourself to find out. Details on here will not help you at all. It has to be a personal experience.",2
"I live around the corner and thought I would check this place out. I love Mexican food and thought that this place did a decent job. I thought it was very similar to Filibertos, nearly identical although not as greasy. I thought the prices were also a bit less. The chile verde, cheese quesadilla, rice, beans taquitos were all very good. I will be back to try some of the other menu items.",2
"My experience eating at this place resembles Manny T's. I only give it a 2nd star because it was open on a day when everything else was closed. The fact that some Yelpers give this restaurant 5 stars, and it has an overall rating of 4 stars, really diminishes Yelp's credibility in my mind. 'Disgusting' is a big word, but this place comes close.",1
I love this place! I thought I knew what I was doing so I was skeptical about working out with a trainer. I had one session with Ace and was hooked and can't wait to go back! I had a fantastic workout. He pushed me to work harder than I would have on my own and I love how I am feeling today and can't wait for my next workout! Two thumbs way up for Gold's!,2
"You can't beat their special that is in their classic pasta dishes. get one and the chef treats you to another one to take home! I have to say the Four Cheese Ravioli makes me salivate just thinking about it. I swear, next time, I am going to get the ravioli for BOTH dishes! I can't wait til we get to go back!",2
"Another great visit to this store, this time with friends in tow. Seems my friends didn't believe me that you could bring 5 people into this store and less than an hour later, leave with all the stuff you came in for. I would recommend coming in at opening or closing. I don't imagine that it would be nearly as fun with crowds of people. Boris and Leroy do a heck of a job with style and class.",2
"If you like your eggs, hash browns and bacon with a side of 70's porn and a dash of despair, this is the place for you. It's an institution because of the novelty, not because of the food or atmosphere. So, if you keep your expectations low and your hands on the table top, you'll get through it just fine. Coffee with a shot of Kahlua helps.",1
Love this place. 23.99 AYCE is amazing. They let you pick from anything on the menu. Quality is excellent for an AYCE. Everytime I visit Las Vegas Yama Sushi is a must! They are always super busy at dinner. A little tip is sit at the sushi bar for the best sevice. The waitresses are always slammed with tables and this way the Sushi Chef really gives you personalized service.,2
"No stars. Should not be affiliated with ABE Cafe's found along the Gulf Coast. Hard beignets, burnt toast, lukewarm food with no garnishment. Steak N Shake has much better skillets! Service is okay. Obvious why there is no wait during peak brunch times. We went on a Saturday and the place was a ghost town.",1
"Ok some hole in a wall places are worth taking a peak. This would be one. The one in Casa Grande and the one in Arizona City are very good. Pros. As close to authentic as a Gringo like myself wants to get. Great quality, Large portions, and the flavors are well balanced. Cons. Casa Grande has out door seating only, which means if its hot or cold so are you. nArizona City its an half hour drive.",2
"typical ayce sushi joint. i got the typical order. yellowtail, tuna, eel, smelt roe, vegetable tempura, udon, and ice cream. i usually dont get rolls because its too much rice. the portions were good. the eel was very thin but tastey. some places the eel is meaty but dont have much taste except for the sauce. this one was pretty good. attentive service and clean.",2
"Denny's with more parking than the one on the strip. Service is still horrible, a standard Denny's signature service marker. Nothing else really different, other than the fact that you're in Las Vegas and probably need to sober up before your long drive home. It gets the job done as you would expect.",1
"I used a coupon for buy one, get one free waffle cone from the fashion show mall coupon book. It was 8.65 including tax for the 2, due to the coupon. I had hazelnut and pistachio. Honestly, it was pretty sad. The cone was the best part. I mean if I didn't have the coupon. 8.65 for a one scoop cone. Really ?!?! The people there were nice enough, but the gelato left something to be desired.",1
"A truly impressive facility. I came in for two books not knowing this location I normally go to Appaloosa . The staff was very helpful and I found what I wanted very quickly I was there 10 minutes, tops. I would highly recommend this Library to anyone interested I'll be coming back very soon for my next batch.",2
"Bouncer staff was unprofessional when dealing my group of bicycling friends. Their words ""we don't like you here "" were unneeded and unprofessional. I will not come back here if they don't support bicyclists. Why do they have bicycles hanging over their taps if they don't bicyclists to buy drinks?!?!?",1
"Traveled all the way from Los Angeles to get a window repaired here due to a friends recommendation. Well worth the trip! Rick does excellent work and even had him make a few new windows for me. Fast service, a real artist and extremely helpful and professional. It's amazing how adding some color and light can really add to the architecture of your home!",2
"There are plenty of historical exhibits but I thought the museum as a whole was lacking. It wasn't interactive at all, nothing about iconic moments in the sport or crashes which everyone I think expects to see something about. The check in cards are a gimmick. All the cool stuff you had to pay extra to do.",1
I finally got the chance to eat at Sens for the first time and loved every single dish we ordered which totaled nine plus rice. The Hong Kong dumplings and flat rice were our favorites. Chef Johnny even comes to each table to make sure that you are enjoying your food. Every time I return to Phoenix I will make sure to sample more dishes at this wonderful establishment. Good job Chef!,2
"Pleasantly surprised! You never know what you're going to get when you hop off the interstate for a meal. We had their ""gourmet "" pizza which they were kind enough to ""half "" with plain cheese for the kids. And their grilled Caesar salad was really good too. Lots of chicken! I'd recommend this place for the road warriors, and we'd come again!",2
"Not a fan. I desperately needed a manicure and being new to the area, stumbled upon this nail salon. I had heard about Nini Nails on the west side but didn't want to stray too far away from home just to get my nails done. BIG MISTAKE. I waited FOREVER for someone to assist me even though it was mid week and not busy and to make matters worse, my nails chipped within 3 days.",1
"This may have been the best hotel I walked through while in Vegas. The structure was gorgeous, they have gondola rides outside and madam toussauds is attached! So many of my favorite things. The actualy structure of the building is beautiful and tries to represent Venice as best as it can with the miles of casinos. If when I go back to Vegas, I would love to stay here and give it a shot.",2
"My first visit to the half shell. I ordered the crab and shrimp nachos, a half order must of weighed two pounds. I couldn't finish it, bigger is not always better, but I should have known better. By the time I found any crab or shrimp it was cold. I would give another item of the menu a try another day though.",1
"Like most people, I check yelp before deciding which place go. There were many pho restaurants to choose from but we decided on Kinh Do but with much disappointment. I ordered the bun Bo ue sp not sure how to spell it but it's the spicy noodle soup. Very very salty. My fianc u00e9e had pho and she said it was descent.",1
Friendly and quick service. In and out. Spacious store. Well put sandwich together and not soggy after I get home with the dressing in it. I will be back though my only gripe is parking is not so easy so you have to park on the street. Yay for Subway's 5 footlong. Fantastic deal and fresh. Can't be beat. I agree with Ronald.,2
"Better to venture off property than have dinner here. It's expensive and our meal was completely forgettable. The kids had burgers which were basic. I had scallops and fettuccine which was uneven. Scallops were cooked to perfection and were really enjoyable. The pasta was seriously undercooked. The pork shank with fig reduction was overcooked, dry and chewy and way too sweet.",1
"Pittsburgh ians, you are lucky to have such a fantastic coffee shop in your city! nI was in town recently for a conference and came here almost every day. The staff started recognizing me because I was there so often, haha. Their coffee is just unbelievably delicious I think it's intelligensia. Not really a place to hang out, just to get it to go.",2
2 stars for the great service! 3 stars for all the food. The bone in ribeye was bland and overcooked. nThe lobster was really chewy and fishy smelling. nThe foie gras was good but I mean when is the liver of an specially fattened duck not good? For the we spent I just expected so much more! Yelp.you let me down!,1
"I would've appreciated if the menu had mentioned all their pizzas are wheat before I had 50 dollars worth of disgustor on our table. Even my wife's sandwich left much to be desired. Over priced and under flavored. Severely disappointing, especially considering the other reviews. At least the atmosphere was nice.",1
"I am super fan. I have been hitting this place up for about two years.Yeah, I know I need to submit my reviews faster. SMH. Its terrible. Sorry for the rant. Every time I set foot in this building, I great customer service with quick, healthy food. I have no compliments, just praise for this location. Four thumbs up!",2
"Have been here a few times and all three 3 visits were a let down. The food is marginal as I have found much better Thai food in other locations in town. Marnee Thai was better back in the day, and the Thai Noodle House and Archie's are much better. Additionally, the service here has lacked a great deal upon every visit. ""Busy "" does not necessarily translate into ""quality "". Would never return.",1
"Come on down into Grumpy's and laugh with the hilarious staff, find your corner amid the stone walls and listen to local talent sing, strum their guitars or rock out on a ukulele. The beer is plentiful and the prices are reasonable. It's downtown but a bit tucked away, so it almost feels like your own special bar.",2
"Terrible breakfast. Under no circumstances should you come here for breakfast. I ordered the farm eggs. When they arrived they were cold and bland. The whole thing tasted like it had been taken out of a packet and microwaved. The ""country sausages "" are particularly unpalatable. Unless you are interested in eating airplane food, give this place a miss. Service was good.",1
I've been using this salon exclusively for the past six or seven years because of how Rose the owner and her staff treat me. I've never had to redo a single nail and over the years I've tried everything! Don't let the poor reviewers stop you from visiting this shop. Just expect to wait because she's busy with repeat customers. And new ones.,2
"When my husband's computer completely crashed, we took it right in to RedSeven. They took care of everything and before we knew it, they called back and told us the computer was up and running and functioning perfectly and to come anytime to pick it up! Their work was excellent, the staff is courteous, and the turn around time for the repair was exceptional. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",2
"My wife and I lived in Las Vegas for several years and we were captivated by the Bellagio hotel and casino. It's charm and elegance are unrivaled and the accommodations are among the most comfortable and finest we've seen. When we are visiting Las Vegas, this is where we choose to stay. A truly romantic setting. Pros Accommodations, Entertainment, Dining",2
"Fantastic customer service, fantastic environment with a great Facebook page. I enjoy coming to try their beverages several times a week and always look forward to seeing the daily special or something new they came up with. Save your drink stamps and collect enough for a free beverage. Very lucky to live so close!",2
"We went last night with low expectations and were wowed. A lot of reviewers commented on his voice, no, I don't think it is as good as it used to be but Meat Loaf put his all into the over 2 hour show. I expected more of a bland concert visually and was thrilled to see all his added treats! Yes, tap dancers! i agree both the background singers and band were amazing.",2
"Never used their service, and never will. Yesterday I was driving along side one of their cars in Glendale, and one of their drivers a 400 lb. behemoth of a man rolls down his window and litters a bunch of paper all over the street. I tried to call the company, but evidently their is no supervisor EVER available, and no way to even leave a message. Rude operators too I'm done here.",1
"One of those places thats literally a shack that you hope is a diamond in the rough and the good news is that it is! There is no reason why some of the combo's for the dogs work, but they do and its awesome! Make sure your in the mindset to try something totally weird and different and then go balls out! its the only way to fully appreciate what this place has to offer. Cant wait to go back again!",2
"I would not use them again. They did not clean thoroughly for our move in cleaning, despite having been at our house for over five hours. I had to call back to have them re clean some portions of our home that I had requested be cleaned that were not. I just think they do a halfway job, or the least amount they can get away with. Will not use again.",1
"In Out never fails on taste, quickness of your order however, is a different story. Sometimes you can get it within 2 minutes, sometimes 10. Aside from their timing, I've never got a wrong order or an order thats anything less of delicious. I usually get a cheeseburger with onions and tomato and animal style fries with a pink lemonade.",2
"Great place. I had a delicious pork sandwich with just the right balance of pork, sauce, and bread, crispy cole slaw, and a refreshing sour beer called the smutty dog. More importantly, it had a great atmosphere. It's not the most crowded bar, but don't let that fool you. It's a great place to go for a relaxing time, a sandwich, and a beer.",2
"Okay.I'm gonna keep saying this until you get it in your head! You looking for sushi? Why are you coming here? Yes, I know it says RA ""Sushi "" it also says ""Bar "" come for the drinks and atmosphere. Really the sushi is not gonna blow any minds anytime soon. Their reverse happy hour is always a delight since prices drop and the drinks keep flowing Stay thirsty my friends!",1
The only reason people visit this place is because of the tv show. If it weren't for the tv show this place would be like any other pawn shop. If you think you're going to go to vegas and meet the cast you are highly mistaken. Since they're paid celebrities now there is no need for them to be there. The pawn shop itself is nothing grand either. The only disappointment of going to Las Vegas,1
"My husband introduced me to Northwest Veterinary Hospital. He's been bringing his pets here for over 15 years. Dr. Gumfory is very knowledgeable and caring and his office doesn't overcharge. My pups get their shots, meds, food, teeth cleanings, check ups and sadly, surgeries here and I highly recommend them. If you're looking for a reputable vet at very competitve prices, look no further!",2
"Their thai boba slush and taro boba slushies are what me and the hubby get just about every visit. The boba is always fresh and the slushies are made very well. The service is friendly and fast! They have appetizers on the menu, but we digress we haven't tried them yet. The crispy calamari certainly looks good though!",2
"Really disappointed with Circus Circus. I have great memories of this place from when I was an out of control kid. And then from my 21st birthday. But when we came here again, I was shocked. It was filthy, crowded, run down and embarassing. The circus shows weren't even close to what they used to be. It needs a rehaul or to be razed.",1
I've been here twice. Once for brunch and once for late night type stuff. As most of the reviews state the food is good. I feel the portions are great. I think the overwhelming cheese plate could use more bread. The service is friendly and reminiscent of going over to a friend's house. A friend that charges you for the food you've eaten.,2
"I called in an order after leaving a near by tanning salon. I arrived earlier than my estimated pick up time by 15 minutes. Instead of making me wait, they got my order together right away. Very fast, friendly service. nI've never been disappointed with their food. They are consistent with the quality and quantity every single time I eat here.",2
"If we ever want wings we come to Native New Yorker. Yes there are other places that make them, but we live close by and we like them. This place had tons and tons of tv's and tons of seating indoors and outdoors. We've never had a problem with our orders etc. I always order the Hot wings and Honey Hot. Tuesdays they offer cheaper wings and i will definitely be a regular here.",2
"Spend your money else where! This place shouldn't even get one star! I came in there on a Monday night about an hour before they closed wanting a polish change and some chick who looks like a witch, looked at me crazy and said ""no we're bout to close "" with a nasty attitude. Don't even bother going here unless you don't mind feeling uncomfortable.",1
"Being a patron of the original Habit in Cali for many years, I was skeptical! Shoulda known that The Habit would not disappoint, period! Amazing burgers, just like home! You gotta try the Santa Barbara Burger with a side of the tempura green beans and their homemade ranch! You will be a SoCalBeliever of The Habit io time!",2
I had had a bad experience earlier this year and received an invitation to come back on the restaurant's dime and try it again which I did in June the food was back up to par but the restaurant has not honored my receipt for reimbursement. Now we are going into dispute hopefully can avoid small claims court. What a disappointment. this place used to be a joy to visit.,1
"Thought i would be hip and try this ""fancy hotdog joint. "" I don't know what these hipsters are thinking. 8 bucks for a hotdog i could buy at Giant Eagle or a Sunoco for a dollar. Dogs weren't even bun size, or 1 4 pound. Fries were soggy and below average. I will stick to Frankies right down the street, or boil some dogs at home before i ever spend another dime at this joint.",1
"I've never stayed at a hotel that charged me BEFORE I even checked in. Then charged my card again after I asked them not to I'd be paying in cash because I couldn't avoid another over draft fee. If I ran out the door and tried to stiff them, yeah, by all means, you have my card on file. But charge me TWICE before I even attempted to check out? I've never been to a hotel this sketch.",1
"Their pancakes are so good! They're practically a dessert themselves! Sometimes the service can get backed up when they're really busy, but the staff is always very nice. The outdoor seating is really nice during the cooler months, and the booths are nice a long for big parties. All around great breakfast place ",2
"You place your order and get a buzzer. Then you pay. Service is pretty quick even when it looks packed. I usually order The Original which is roast beef, cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce. I'm actually not a fan of horseradish, but I really don't mind it being in this sandwich. It's open 24 7 so it is an alternative to Lee's or pho after a fantastic drunkeight of debauchery!",2
"The vets are typical in and out vets. What makes this place stand out and keeps me loyal are the friendly, helpful and all around awesome ladies at the reception counter. They are always sweet and helpful and welcoming. Making appointments is easy and they can usually see you same day. HIGHLY recommend. Only the best for my doggy!",2
"Do the words ""Over Capacity "" mean anything? Seriously, people. I waited in line for all of 15 minutes with some girlfriends, went in, got an overpriced drink and proceeded to be squished due to the amount of people there. It's not a dance club, as there is no room to dance. It's a music club and it's pretty inside but that's all it's got going for it.",1
"Hostess could use a lil help with customer service, other than that the waiter was great, definitely made up for the hostess lack of customer service. The ambiance is hip and music is loud. Good place to hang out for birthday, bachelor, bachelorette or girls guys night out. Food is really good. My favs are the sea bass, Kobe beef sashimi and anything on the sushi menu.",2
"I love going to Todai everytime I visit Vegas. This year, I went with my mom and sis for dinner since we love sushi buffets. I stocked up on all the good stuff, of course. sashimi, the rolls with less rice so I can eat more P . All are excellent quality of course. Oh, and the chocolated covered strawberries are so freakin good! Finally, finish it off with crepes and you're set for the night!",2
"Stopped in here on my way home one day looking for a vaporizer. The place was clean and well lit, and by the time I started lookinh near the vaporizors some one came over to see if I needed any help. He answered my questions and didn't pressure me or try to upsell me, and steered me away from a couple he didnt think I would enjoy. I'll definitely be back for more hardware if needed!",2
"Love this place! I wasn't sure about it the first time, seeing that is in a strip mall, but like the saying goes don't judge a book by it's cover. nI order the CHICKEN W GREEN every time and have not been disappointed. EGG ROLLS are wrapped in thin egg roll paper, spicy, delicious. MANGO CHICKEN CLAY POT DISHES are also excellent. nIndependent yummy.",2
"So yummy! All of the food we ordered was great. I ordered the Caprese, with chicken and a side of soup. My girls had a Monday and a Perfect Combination. Everything was fresh. The fruit was sweet and perfectly ripe. The staff was friendly and seemed to be happy to be working. A great atmosphere. We will absolutely visit again. ",2
"Ordered the shrimp fried rice for takeout. It was hot, but bland. No scrambled egg, which is a basic fried rice ingredient. The rice was on the dry side, and everyone in our party agreed that soy sauce was needed to give it some flavor. I'll give it another try and sample more menu items, but this isn't a good start.",1
If give them zero stars but it won't let me. They charge you a deduct able on all repairs and even though something is installed in your house before you ever looked at it they make you handle replacing the unit claiming non partisan on the major appliance. Don't advertise something and not support it. Double standard political garbage should be removed from Vegas.,1
"Wow, I have never received such crappy service in my life. The Barista must've worked for the welfare office or dmv, or another city service job, cause her attitude showed. Sometimes these people forget what they do and who they work for. Avoid this location, either go to the on on camelback or 7 st.",1
"The suites in this place are monstrously spacious. The beds are soft and comfortable. Service is quick and customer centered. And the hotel is stunningly gorgeous the decor, surprisingly subtle in a city where fantasy and reality blends and hopes are realized and dashed within smoky hazes and scents of hooker perfumes. Prices are a bitch. But hey, it's Vegas.",2
"This place is designed for sensory overload. The pretty servers with bangin' bodies and tattoos. The gaudy decor with the loud wallpaper. And the loud music and monstrous bar. It was a feast for the eyes. I wish the food had been the same. The pretzel balls are awesome, and that's about it. It's overpriced and disappointing.",1
"LOVE Pure Body Fitness Studio! It's a unique group exercise fitness facility with so much to offer! Each room is dedicated to specific work outs. 1. TRX room n2. Boot camp n3. Yoga n4. Cycling n5. Pilates n6. Barre n7. And all the amazing les mills classes! n BodyPump, CXWORX, Body Attack, BodyStep, Body Flow. CLEAN Facility, fab locker rooms, and awesome staff! Two thumbs up for PB fitness! ",2
"my roomie and i have been trying out all the east blvd. restaurants since we moved in the neighborhood about 2 months ago. this place is my least favorite so far. the service took forever it was about 10 minutes before we even got our drinks. the food was just meh. our waiter was not very attentive. with all the other great options on the block, i doubt we'll be going back anytime soon.",1
Went for brunch. I ordered the smoked salmon croissant. My bread was burned and I had to ask for my side of potato. My friends ordered scrambled eggs with cheddar and well done crispy bacon. She received eggs with monterey jack and her bacon was not crispy. We had to track down our waiter for the check. The one salvation for the meal was their chocolate cake. It was superb.,1
"i had had the burger salad.it was good. I usually think protein burgers leave something to be desired, but this one was just right! fries were great! mint chocolate chip shake was amazing! Just a bit too expensive! 2 burgers, one grilled cheese, one soda and one shake for about 45! hence the 4 points.",2
"I had an emergency on the morning I was leaving for Europe. I literally said to myself, ""I could go to Best Buy, but I'm going to go to Bigg's because I can't take a risk. "" They sold me an accessory that didn't work for my camera! I even questioned it because I said it didn't look right. I expect that at Best Buy but not at Bigg's.",1
"Love the space even though I caever get myself into a good one. My timing doesn't ever allow me or my peeps to do anything other than try to continually move out of the way. However, the two times I snagged a seat it was also dead , I HAD THE BEST GRILLED CHEESE and TOMATO SOUP EVER! That is why I love this place. That and the fact that it's in a lovely old Hansel and Gretal house.",2
"One star for the awesome outdoor seating and one star for the Guitar Hero nights. I stopped going here last week because n I finally had to accept that when you pay with a debit card, the waitress just gives herself whatever tip she wants, regardless of what you actually wrote on the receipt. n The beer tastes watered down and the food is ridiculously bland and over priced.",1
"AZ Humane Society Thrift Store is a place to find some really great things at some really low prices. They have a lot of things, in my opinion even more of a variety then other thrift stores. From books to tv's to dog food to clothes to furniture and much more. Most of all, I love that when I shop there my money is going to someplace where its really needed.",2
"Awesome and amazing delicious food. Fresh and everything. HOWEVER, it took 2 hours for us to receive our food. Called at 5 42pm and didn't get it till 7 35pm. We have three kids under 5 who were so hungry. Prob would have been faster going somewhere else. 2 hours is just ridiculous! 1 star for good food. Zero for terrible delivery! And 1 for the apology and kind man who delivered!",1
"Service brings the stars down for this place. The burgers were reasonably priced, the aged steaks loook liked they might be delicious in the window, but we were never that hungry. The bus boys were friendly, but I don't remember our waitresses name. Maybe because the only time that we saw her was when she gave us the check. Seriously someone else even took our order.",1
"Wife took me here for lunch the other day. WOW. Only had the tacos 2 pulled pork, and 1 brisket and wow the flavors and the hint of spice to give it a bit of kick were awesome. Giving 4 start based off that one meal but will be back to update after I have eaten there a couple more times. Excellent first visit.",2
"Love the decor and ambience, and the scallops and bacon app was delicious, but the cocktails were watered down heavily with melted chipped ice and large ice cubes even when I asked for very little ice in my manhattan . Next time, I'm ordering at the bar to watch them pour the two ounces. My wife's rye and ginger was served with flat ginger ale. C'mon guys, what's up with that?",1
"This Courtyard Marriott is located near the big ol raceway, so I imagine at times this place is nuts. I would not want to stay here during race weekends. However, on a quiet, nothing weekend, this location is pleasant. It has high floors, which I prefer. The people who work here, especially in the bistro, are funny and competent. I would stay here again.",2
I love this location. My first time having Italian ice and custard and Rita's did not disappoint! I love how there's different flavors all the time. I get something new each time I go in. There is plenty of sitting to enjoy inside. It's starting to get hot again and this place is perfect for cooling off!,2
This was my first visit here. It is kind of tucked in a corner. Probably one of the most pleasant pedicure experience ever. Ask for Danny. He just gave me the best pedicure. He made my day. I must have the happiest feet in the valley right now. He did such a great job and an awesome foot massage. Go Danny go!,2
"If you stop eating frozen custard for a while and then go back to it, you wish you never tried it again. After a few years frequenting this place, the Oreo malt is the only thing I consider ordering. And that is only if someone I'm with really wants to go and is paying for it. Prices are obscene. All of the food is greasy, bland, and expensive.",1
"Absolutely delicious! If you're a foodie, you will absolutely LOVE this place. And if you're anything like my wife and me, you'll leave the antique store with a few goodies, too! We tried the burger the the chicken sandwich both were phenomenal. The sweet potato chips and tater tots were to die for, as well.",2
I love their Delux burgers and the sweet potato fries. I often stop by after church on Sunday and get an order for my hubby and me to go. It's kind of become a ritual for us. Be sure to ask for the aioli sauce for the fries. It's so good and spicy. The waiters are friendly too especially Chris who always seems to take my order.,2
"Damn. First, I thought, 4.50 for a gelato and only one scoop of it.that's a lotta money even for Vegas. Then I saw the scoop. It's like 2 pretty big scoops pretending to be one. I ordered the blackberry one since I've been obsessed with blackberries lately and damn, it was good. A great light dessert before dancing the night away in Vegas.",2
"These girls are goddesses! They all clearly have dance backgrounds and perform amazingly! The girls on the revolving ring did some insane stuff, it was spectacular. If you're looking for a show that brings home the good old days of true burlesque, then this show is for you. No trashy strippers half performing their routines here.",2
"The pizza is fantastic. They always have cheese ready to go, which is great when you are vegetarian. The atmosphere is good. The staff could step it up a bit but it doesn't bother me too much. The buy ten slices get one free is great. This is a good place to just drop in for a slice on your way home from where ever you were. Love it.",2
"Nice Hotel but Bad Casino. the gambling floor is really small. n they did not have food service at the pool but said they will soon, this was in March. n tried to upsell me a better view of the fountain for 35 more a night, I didnt bite. i got the back side of the airport.Pist. n for 20 bux more i could of stayed at Caesars Palace that weekend",1
I go before closing and order the tandori chicken. They serve it with bell peppers and onions. It ask comes with rice and lemons. I order rai cucumber sauce and garlic nan. The owner is very friendly and always knows what I want. Nice to see a family run business. The chai ice tea is good too. Will try buffet soon,2
"Went here for lunch today. What we sampled nThe Onion Ring Tower delicious I really liked the campfire sauce nPrime Chophouse Burger decent, but overall meh as yelp would put it nSteak Fries I usually hate steak fries to I will say these were great Overall it was decent for lunch, but I don't love chains so I would rather go somewhere else.",1
"This is a great quirky little restaurant. I usually stray away from places that have every kind of food under the sun, but this place is different. The food is always very fresh, hot and delicious. Everything is very clean. I get the feeling that the owners management staff really have their heart in it. Pretty quick too.",2
"Not the greatest view relatively. Save the horrendous additional fee that the Reservation charges and walk around Guano Point which is included in parking fee. The views are better, more thrilling, More exhilarating. Even if Skywalk were free and Guano Point cost 30, Guano Point would still be better.",1
Called to learn the color line they are using as I've experienced bad chemical reactions to hair coloring. I was told it's an Italian line that I won't be able to find online information on. When I asked again if they would tell me the line so I could do my own research on the color I was told no something about proprietary information. ?,1
Me and my girlfriend come here all the time but we just went for her 21st birthday and it was amazing. Our server Ruben was playing along with everything we threw at him and bringing her drinks he thought she would like. The pizza is incredible. I recommend the Jeremiah red if you like beer and don't forget to have a pizookie at the end! Bjs has never failed me. Always a joy,2
The poutines were very delicious at this location. Super savoury and scrumptious. Tired four types of poutines but the Italienne was the best in my opinion. The blue cheese one was somewhat strong but still great. The service however is subpar but the food makes up for it. Highly recommended. The parking is difficult so be prepared to look around.,2
"Totally disappointed here, people. Server forgot to input my order and the place wasn't even busy. I ended up getting the wrong order after a lengthy 40 minute wait. So the manager gives me a 2 coupon for my next visit. It's still sitting in my car. Not too generous on the pours. and the Malibu Pineapple was too watery. Definitely a downer in my book ",1
You can see a man in back cutting fresh potatoes to fry. French style. I'm sure somewhere back there there are other workers cutting more fresh ingredients I feel bad for whoever got stuck with onions because that's what it tasted like to me. It was a clean environment and staffed enough so the line moved quickly.,2
Uncle Sam's is my favorite local eatery. My little one loves the pizza and fries and I am a fan of the Philly cheese steak which is by far the best in town I have been to South Street in Philly several times and can compare! The wings and hoagies are also great. The only reason I gave it a four star and not a five is the salads are overpriced.,2
"I have been going here for over 15 years. I've consigned a wedding ring got top dollar , bought new his hers wedding bands wholesale prices , silver chains, replaced watch batteries, you name it! All with reasonable and honest prices. I wouldn't trust anyone else. Not always timely and the store is just a ok inside, but it is all very worth it and I couldn't speak more highly.",2
"Although smaller than the Lee's on Spring Mt., this location has the same menu and is clean and airy. My grilled pork banh mi was absolutely yummy. And spicy! Take out the peppers if this is not your thing. The bread is always made fresh here and they also have these huge pork and egg baos for just 1.99 each. If you're looking for good cheap food, this place is worth a visit.",2
"The service at this place is super slow to the point of nonexistence, the food comes out luke warm and don't expect a refill of hot water water for your tea, we waited 20 minutes and the server finally came back as we walking out the restaurant with the teapot. The won ton soup is good but I wished they would have served it hot. The the crab noodles are pretty good but super greasy!",1
"First of all i'm not a big fan of buffet, i tried it because we got a 50 credit for staying here at Monte Carlo in Las Vegas and my friend wanted it so I gave it a chance. Decent taste and There wasn't enough variety of food, service wasn't that great either. so it still doesn't change my mind about buffet.",1
They ran out of cheese! Gave me a 2 hour delivery window after already waiting 45 minutes for my pizza. Then five day refund window for cancelling my online order. What a joke. THEY RAN OUT OF CHEESE AT A PIZZA PLACE! Should say enough about how this place is run. Update. 2 weeks later no refund was processed. Called and was instructed by the staff to call my bank. Charge back it is I suppose.,1
I brought my wife and six year old son to this place. It was my first experience at a place like this and I had a blast. My son was entertained and worked up a good sweat. The food is just as pricey as a baseball game or movie theatre. It's spacey and offers different levels of trampolines for children of all ages. I really enjoyed it.,2
Most overpriced mediocre Asian food ever. Everything tasted like something you could get at a fast food Chinese restaurant. It's ridiculous that they charge 18 for a plate of vegetables and 28 for some rice porridge. I don't understand why people even come here! I would never choose to eat here if I was actually paying for it.,1
"It was our first time trying poutine. It was also our last time. So much hype about poutine and everytone said go to la banquise. but it was soggy french fries covered in a sweetish gravy with salty cheese curds. HUH? Should we have been plastered to appreciate this novelty? Such a bummer, we paid our bill and left. Sadly, the most disappointing part of Montreal trip.",1
"I like to go to a sports bar to watch an event. But I got to say that this place looks ooooold and outdated. Food is meh. but am I setting my expectations to high for La Cage Aux Sports? I don't know, but this one in particular, is not that great. The Boisbriand one is much nicer and worth the detour if you can make it.",1
"Well this is my gym and of course I love it! nLots of different training no one way for anyone. Want to workout have a good time workout on making your self more fit this might be a great place for you or of you are hurt they train lots of prevention and mobility , stability training and technique. Or if you just want to get stronger there is a weightlifting club as well!",2
"Late Night ONLY! The worst shakes. Greasy whip cream that filled up half the cup. I ordered an oreo shake and it was just whip cream and a few crumbs of oreo cookie. Mix that with there nasty whip cream it was disgusting. My mistake for not asking for no whip cream, but it still should not have been half full of it. Just lazy service because it was late.",1
"Are all the wrecking balls and implosion teams booked out or something? Why is this embarrassment to lodging and gaming not reduced to a pile of rubble with chunks of polyester pants, disco balls and coke vials mixed in. The last time this hotel was relevant sinatras nut hairs were still black. Ok, gave it 2 stars because the bed was comfy and the petite suite had a 40 """,1
"funky little cafeteria atop a very popular pittsburgh breakfast spot. it's BYOB always nice and the food is abundant and tasty. very casual, small menu, good, attentive service. plus they have a little shop with peruvian gifts, including an incas vs. spanish chess game, fluffy mini llamas, and bright woven goods.",2
"Zero stars! I could go on and on about the horrific food my boyfriend and I attempted to eat at this place burgers were like shoe leather and the ""fries "" looked like a dirty, wet sponge but I don't want to waste another moment on this ""establishment "". You should be ashamed of yourself, owner of Heart Attack Grill. Worst food ever! DO NOT EAT HERE!",1
"OK.19 years 3 houses and counting. I wouldn't even consider using anyone else. They know EVERYTHING.can answer any question.are always on time and quite reasonable. The techs are professional and courteous and the office is always prompt and efficient. Mike what a way to set an example for the rest of the country! nSusan C. nPhoenix, AZ",2
"I prefer this over WYNN Buffet! There is very little waiting in line. Beside the food here is better in my opinion. Their Prime ribs is way juicier! they also have sear salmon, bone marrow and crab cakes. I used to stay in line and paid over 60 dollars per person at WYNN, but no more. I pick Wicked spoon at Cosmo Politan over any other buffet!",2
"This one is located in the Northern part of the strip. The customer service here is top notch, and they have no problems with returns. Their selection is better than the outlet in the Southern outlets, but it's pretty obvious because this one is probably 3 times bigger than the south. They also carry more styles than the southern outlet.",2
"I don't know what the fuss about this place is about. We waited 1.5 hours for a couple slices of pizza. The line wasn't even long at all. We were maybe 15 people deep. This place is just extremely inefficiently set up. The guys are jumping around everywhere to grab a pizza, grab toppings, throw it in the oven, grab parmesan, etc. The pizza itself was decent but waiting 1.5 hours for 2 slices.",1
"Very fun place! I was here with a friend who doesn't really enjoy video games so she was underwhelmed. Overall, good prices, fun and great music. Did not like 2 things, there were a couple of games that were out of order I would have loved to play, sigh. the other was putting 50 cents in to play machines that used to be 25 cents. Sorry, I'm a cheapskate that way. All in all, fun place!",2
"Had dinner again at the Blue and sat downstairs. While my last experience was sub par, the manager Larry more than made up for it this time. The food was great. We had the clam chowder soup which is always delicious, we moved on to the artichoke, grilled perfectly and ended with stuffed shrimp. Our meal was great and the service was outstanding. We will definitely be back.",2
The lady who takes your blood here is amazing and has never missed. She also has a really great personality and made my 3 hour test a little less miserable. The wait time for appointments has gotten bad and I've had some issues with the front desk being rude. It's not a very personal experience so far and I'm almost through my pregnancy 39 weeks .,1
This place was awful. I'd rather have Taco Bell. The salsa was tomato sauce with cayenne pepper in it. My dinner had no flavor AT ALL and the service was slow at best. Our love of Mexican cuisine has spanned generations and if this is what's consider good Mexican food in the west valley then I'll keep driving to other side of town. Very sad.,1
"How does this place have 4 stars! Hardly any polish to choose from. This saln is NOT clean, someone needs to mop! Makes me wonder how clean the tools they use are The girl who did my pedicure was obviously inexperienced! She kept looking at my facial reaction to see if she cut or nicked me! Never again! I'll stick to Image Salon down the road where real professionals work.",1
"The food could've been better, but the view made up for everything. We used our Groupon, which I'm not sure if the staff had previous problems with this prior.but we were treated like low class citizens. Phillip, our server, acted like he had no time for us. Loved the place, but get the stick out of your butt Phillip.",1
"I have a regret to share I didn't buy enough taffy! Seriously there is something really good about this taffy. So much so that I haven't touched the Cherry Mash I bought. It's been like all taffy, all the time since I brought it home. When a chocoholic puts down the chocolate for the taffy.do I need to say anything more? A resupply run will be necessary very shortly.",2
"Friendly and knowledgable butcher. Clean, odor free shop. Very high quality meat, beautifully and expertly trimmed. Prices are a little higher thaational chains Fry's, Safeway, etc. but the quality more than makes up for it. Direct comparison showed Bull Market's beef to be amazingly tender and flavorful compared to national chain's beef. A shop worth finding.",2
"We stopped in for dinner the other night and were lucky enough to show up during happy hour. We shared the 3 trio of meatballs and a 8 small specialty pizza.what a deal! The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was great and the bar area was huge with plenty of TV's to watch the games. We will definitely be back!",2
It is amazing how this restaurant always has long wait times when I honesty don't believe that the food is great. I have gone a couple of times and each time that I have gone I have gotten different dishes. I feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something. You can definitely find better chain Italian restaurants like Maggiano's or Bravo! Come here if you like bland dishes.,1
"Alchemy is a great place to take people you want to impress. Great views, great food and lots of good service. It is especally lovely when there is a full moon rising over the mountains. Its a little expensive but you can catch happy hour wine and hordourves in the bar and balcony area. I like that they are so happy to see you, very gracious appreciative of their customers.",2
"Nothing shrieks ""date night "" like a laid back Sunday night at a local haunted house riddled with enthusiastic high school actors! And it was definitely a bargain. We purchased the dual Crypt and Asylum on Groupon. When we got there, they talked us into the additional 2 maze add on, which we probably could have done without. Not too crowded, and just the right level of spooky. ",2
"I was looking for a 5 Star Hotel in Las Vegas and decided to book a ""secret "" 5 star hotel on Expedia and I got the Trump Hotel. I would never consider a hotel in Las Vegas a 5 star hotel if it does not have a casino. It was very obviously a condominium building turned into a hotel. I was disappointed. I am warning all of you out there.",1
"LOVE this place! The food is great, the pitchers are the coldest I have EVER had and the price is right. There is happy hour like twice a day and its worth checking out. Oh and the PM bartenders and waitresses are wonderful. I love this place. I'm not sure they are all created equal The Timbers but who wants to chance it?",2
"I like this library.right off LV Blvd.easy to get to location. The library is basically automated now and you rent out books by yourself. There's nothing to write home about.typical study rooms, internet access, etc. We go here to rent audiobooks before long car rides.they have a decent selection and can request books from other locations.",2
"Amazing, I love watching this every time I go to Vegas. It's just nice to watch the fountains from time to time, plus there are amazing artist all along the walk for you to look at after the show is over. So after you wake up from your long night of endless partying take a break and watch the fountains.",2
"Got a Tix4tonight coupon and went here at 9pm after a show. The food was horrible and the couple next to us agreed. I saw the waiters take a lot of full plates from tables as a lot of it wasn't even edible. The pasta tasted weird and the sushi tasted worse.The only think good was the dessert which was heavenly compared to any of the food. nAll in all, it was overpriced and NOT good.",1
"Have not stayed here but after my experience, I never would. Have never been treated more like dirt in my life. Dealers were asses and so we went back to the Venetian, where we were staying, to blow our money and hang with the nicest dealers in town. Do not spend you money in this terrible excuse for a casino. Go where the dealers are friendly and it is a much better experience.",1
"Burrito, after a few bites I discovered I had been chewing on a piece of what appeared to be plastic like cigarette clear wrapping the size of a playing card, the food is always cold, between the food being cold every time I get a burrito there and now foreign objects in the burrito! Come on, its Arizona, there's plenty of better places to get your burrito fix.",1
It has been a long times since I shopped at Smart and Final unitl this past week. I will tell you Prices on most of the products are great and the customer service is Beyond friendly. I will be returning on a regular basis. Prices of some everyday grocery items are usually half what the Grocery store charges. ,2
"I've been here three times. I keep trying to be satisfied, but I always seem to be disappointed. Maybe in the winter when it's cool enough for the patio, I can bring my dog and it might be redeemed a bit. nFood is average. Omelets are thin and meh. Biscuits and gravy are good. Coffee is fine. Service is sketchy. I've had great and I've had horrible.",1
Just leaving the Good Egg after being ignored by everyone in the store after being seated at counter. This a trend that seems to be getting worse with time. The servers seem detached and oblivious to the customers. There has been a high turnover at this store I noticed lately. New faces every weekend. After 23 years I think it is time to find a new Fav breakfast place.,1
Best buffet I've ever experienced. The best variety of food from all over the world in one crack. Try the lobster chowder and the smoked salmon shooter. Those two dishes were so tasty that I had to go back for more. The food quality is also up there. I highly recommend. Pricey but totally worth the experience.,2
Been to two pinks hot dogs now.The supposedly good one and this one and this one sucks. nThe hot dog just sucks. It's nasty. Make it bearable by putting every condiment on it and put pastrami and whatever they have. Cause the dog just straight up sucks. nOh ya the service is not that great either. Small little place. Wouldn't go if your drunk. Just go eat mcdonalds or pizza. Not this,1
"The worst mani pedi I have ever had with Kellie. I had gel nails to remove and she soaked my hands in a bowl of acetate and then stood there scraping it off, which was very uncomfortable. When I suggested what my other salon does to remove gels, she said I guess that's a good idea for the customers convenience. You think? I'll never go back.",1
"The problem may have been that I did not order what the server recommended. I attended a corporate event here, and just about everything was incredibly bland. What did stand out the kim chi with the roasted chicken was outstanding. I've never had moister chicken. Good pinot noir. Very nice, unobtrusive servers. Good view of the Capitol. Not a place I'd return to if I had to pay though.",1
Just want to say thanks to Scott and all the guys that work there. Their service is outstanding my car drives straight as an arrow again if you're buying tires there is no need to look anywhere else they always stand behind their product 100 they always tell you it'll be an hour and it usually only takes about 30 minutes job well done thanks guys,2
"Went on the groupon thinking this was the Siagon Pho on alma school. Well I am not sorry I made this mistake! The pho was very good, I ordered the seafood pho, it had lots of seafood really good tasting broth. We also ordered the cured pork spring roll that was very good too! nVery very nice lunch I will return.",2
Went on a Friday evening and it was pretty busy but we got right in. The beer was cold and the min bottle of champagne hit the spot. We got the crab stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and they were delicious. We ordered the salmon and steak and crab. Everything was VERY good. We'll be back soon. It was expensive but not like other steak houses.,2
"Wow! What an amazing place, from the beautiful patio to the amazing service. The staff really made me feel at home. It has to be one of the best date places in Phoenix. But the thing i liked the most was the type of food, it has a tapas feel except the portions are allot larger. If your on a budget and want to impress someone this is the spot.",2
This is my favorite Mexican Food restaurant. The guacamole is awesome. My husband likes the shredded beef tacos I love the green chile burros enchilada style with green sauce. I have tried many other things on the menu and they are all good! The salsa is great the people are friendly. nIt is clean and I always know what we are getting.,2
The good thing about this place is that it is ideal for families as all age groups will find something to do. My parents could not walk long distances. The kids found some spots to play around. The place does look beautiful but remember to check the weather forecast first as it will be no fun to be out there under a hot sun.,2
What more could you really need in a store? Chocolate everywhere in all shapes and sizes and also bakery items! If you love chocolate or sweets in general this place is a must see. We purchased a treat from the freshly made baked items which was delicious. Also purchased a bag of macadamia nut kisses that are sold in Hawaii.,2
"Service 5 stars prompt, polite . nFood Quality 4 stars meat was fresh, some veggies looked like they were two days ago . nOverall experience 2 stars didn't like spending 45 minutes boiling each morsel of food. The broth was flavorless. Seriously. I can boil cabbage at home, piece by piece, if I really wanted to. Pass.",1
Was not pleased. Been there three times. I wasn't expecting much since it's Madison on a saturday night. On a slow weekday afternoon the service was slow because the bartenders were talking to each other instead of the customers. They used homophobic slurs. It seemed like the guy hired all his frat buddies to work the place. I try to steer people away from there.,1
"Overeasy is Fabulous! My partner and I both had the wolfpack and split an order of sourdough toast. The hash browns were PERFECT! Soft and crunch, not burnt! The eggs were cooked well and there was cheese a plenty! The toast had a great flavor and was hand sliced! The fresh squeezed OJ was great not too tart not too sweet!",2
"OK the girls can be sexy and bud lights are a 1.50, but the love stops there. Service here is not bad, it is pathetic. Where are the drink girls, and bar service does not existent. Plus the place is a smoked filled pigpen. Stop in for a beer if your car breaks down outside, but otherwise, cross the street to the MGM and get better service, drinks and winnings.",1
If you like super poor quality food but cheap and cheap drinks this is your place. I don't hate on the cheap drinks but the food is terrible. Id rather have Taco Bell and I dont even like Taco Bell . Definetly my least favorite place for happy hour the place is small and crowded. I dread when my friends want to meet here. Much better places out there.,1
"Good food but WAY WAY over priced. Small on portions, big on price! Nice staff, old worn out tired decor. If I want to spend lots of money there are NICE and updated restaurants in Scottsdale to choose from. Being located in Cave Creek Carefree does not give license to overcharge their patrons. Likely won't be back.",1
"Went here Saturday for a late breakfast, and had a wonderful meal. There wasn't a wait, the entire staff was very friendly and accommodating, and coffee refills came quickly. 1 for substituting almond milk for cream for no additional cost. I had the SW breakfast burrito and my boyfriend had the French Toast. Both were great will be back soon!",2
This is one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the city. The food is authentic and the carnitas is excellent! nThe location isn't in the best part of town but it's well worth going because the food in amazing and priced great. nIf you want good Mexican food with large portions this is the pace to go.,2
Worst food I have ever ordered. How does anyone eat this garbage? The bar is nice and has several tv's. Just save your money and forget the food. Yuck. We had a good waiter but the food runner was worthless. Dropped off the food and we Asked for silverware and she was gone before we could finish the sentence. How are they still in business?,1
"Yeah, it's cheap, but it's the worst buffet in Las Vegas. I came here, years ago, but I see that nothing has changed much. From what I remember, the fish was rubbery it's always iffy with seafood at buffets unless you go to the Rio and the selection seemed big, but when the food is not good, why bother?",1
Best salmon! nI have always wanted to find the best salmon sushi in Phoenix and I have been to almost everything in the Phoenix area and this place is the best! I'm so happy to find this place. Salmon is so fresh not like most of the sushi places and the price was relatively cheap. I think it was a happy hour. Can go everyday!,2
"A very very classy place. Far removed from the childishness of the strip. So far removed, in fact, that it gets 4 stars instead of the 5 or more that it deserves. Tge rooms are modern and elegant. Valet will always be quick here and there is no elevator security. Still, not highly recomended for men seeking exclusive company, as no professionals will want to travel 30 miles to come see you.",2
"I made an appointment two weeks in advance as I had two cars for them to do the chip repair. Was told between 8 and noon. 1151 am, I called and they said it was to be between 8 and 1 pm, really ! Then they call and said they an emergency and could make it around 130 pm. After this repair going to find someone a little more reliable.",1
Food very average. Great waitress but poor service from the kitchen and bar. Really no excuse because it was early and slow. New owners and managers were in the corner table and seem uninterested in what was happening in the their new restaurant. Really was looking for another alternative in Gilbert. Will not return!,1
"These guys are great! My daughter has an iPhone and is also kind of clumsy sorry, sweetie, but it's true. We've now taken her phone to Desert Wireless twice in 6 months. They take really good care of us. Most of the time they offer to fix it same day and offered us a discount since we're repeat customers. They do quick and high quality work. Highly recommend them!",2
"I've ate here multiple times and the food to me is gross. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it's not very good. It's not expensive but not very good food. The atmosphere is neat it has cool old time decorations! The waitstaff has always been very nice too. I will not go back here though because I do not like the food.",1
"My wife and I like this place. It's always crowded, but you can wait in the wine bar if that's not also packed to the brim which it usually is . The pizza is the best in the area exquisite crust, nice ingredients. Pricey, though. And parking is a pain. Luckily, Mt Lebo parking tickets are like 7.00, which is what you'd pay at a downtown garage anyway.",2
"DON'T GO HERE! I stopped by here not to long ago because there is no other Chinese food near me like this one and let me say the food was TERRIBLE! I bought orange chicken and fried rice, the chicken was BURNED and it had NO sauce. The rice was even more disgusting it had NO FLAVOR and they just added soy sauce to the steamed rice ugh! Never ate Chinese food done in such a LAZY way!",1
"First time trying this place, and for sure won't be the last time. It was awesome! The service was awesome after telling the person who served us that this was our first. He explained in detail and let us try some samples before we bought. This place will be on our radar from now on when choosing a place to eat.",2
"I love their pizza. I especially love it when I am there during happy hour and get a discount. They have a lot of events which I never seem to make it to, but I keep trying. Service has always been very good although it can take some time when it is busy. The crust is top notch. Salads are decent although I usually just get side salads and not the dinner salads which look huge.",2
"I absolutely love the staff at McAdams Dental and Dr. Don is the best dentist I have ever met! I believe the dental office should be a warm and happy place, not cold and uncomfortable. If you dread going to the dentist, then you need to try out this office. They will change your entire perspective. You couldn't ask for a better group of people to work on you and keep your mouth healthy. ",2
I usually love this place but today I had bad service. The workers and manager were more interested in talking than working and as a result my car took forever while other vehicles came later and were out sooner. When I mentioned it to the manager he made an excuse and did not care. But he was the one yapping and keeping my technician distracted.,1
I was very nervous to try fitness classes because I always feel like I'm going to fall behind or not be able to handle it. They made me feel so welcome here. It was definitely a workout but every instructor makes sure you're doing the exercise properly! I love that! The place is very clean very fun!,2
"They completely butchered my straight shoulder length hair. I just wanted a trim with slight layering around the face, but I ended up with hair one inch shorter on the left side of my face, and pieces hanging down in back that they forgot to cut. I think a 6 year old could have done a better job actually.",1
"I couldn't get a read on this place from online sources. Upon driving over there, my friend and I realized it was a pool hall and bar with finger food. It looked like a fine blue collar place for pool beer after work. It didn't serve meals and was definitely not a place for white collar guys like us. I recommend going there only if you know someone who already frequents the place.",1
"I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies, nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time. I decided to give it another chance for happy hour, well guess what? flies followed me inside too. I don't know if it was the time of year early spring or what, but they really need an exterminator!",1
"Another great Vegas buffet, with a worldly twist. I love the theme here, all regions of the world have their own section of the buffet, with many dishes representing each region, including the sea. The indian section is gross, the Italian is great, Seafood is great, Mexican is OK. Just a fun buffet, and you'll definitely leave content.",2
"This is a Four Seasons in every way nice room, superior service etc. Whilst the rooms don't have the extreme luxury such as flat screen in bath room or darkening shades, they offer killer views of the Strip ensure to ask for a room with Strip view. . In addition to the views, this hotel undeniably has the best breakfast in LA.",2
"Awful service. Did not get my full order going thru drive thru. Realized it after I got home. Drove back and went inside to complain. The guy actually tied handing me the bag of food that he forgot to give me after it had been sitting there for 20 minutes. Asked for a refund for compensation, but they refused!",1
"This is my fav place to eat at while in Vegas. LOVE LOVE LOVE. The salsa bar is awesome, and the fajitas are incredible I get the shrimp . The food is great here, the service is also perfect, and I love the atmosphere as well. Rarely have waited for a table either. Usually play poker at the hotel, then walk over for dinner. Highly recommend.",2
"I will never darken their doorstep again. I've had sub par sushi before, but I have never, EVER left an establishment feeling ill after eating there. Couple that with their lazy service, lackluster flavor combinations what is that gross sauce that they put on EVERYTHING? , and borderline microscopic portion sizes, it was absolutely NOT worth how much I paid. Never again. Ew.",1
 update! Okay got my money back so yay! D so it seems! that Tabu punched in my number for the second transaction. I had my bank look at the charges and only one was swiped and the other was keyed in. SO BEWARE OF THIS PLACE! it's hilarous how they think they wont get caught. plz. u guys fail. be smarter than that plz.,1
"If you are in the mood for bland room temperature delivery that takes 2 hours to get to you, this is definitely the place for you! All that and the delivery lady yells at you trying to tell you that she is in front of your house when she isn't even close. Yup, this place is pretty much the worst place on earth.",1
"I found this place online with pretty good reviews. However, coming from the bay area, I had high expectations. It turned out the food wasn't very good. I'm sure the food had MSG as I was feeling thirsty after eating. However, being in the middle of the desert, it's difficult to find good dim sum place. I'd give them credit for trying.",1
"Professional and able to accommodate my schedule. There are a ton of masseurs in Charlotte, but few are as nice, professional, and generous as Mike with Infini Massage and Body Works! Great massage, great guy, great results! I highly recommend. I am also thinking of having INFINI come to our office for a thank you to our staff!",2
The worse massage i have gotten any where. Felt like i was getting my head scratched instead of massaged. The head scratching went on for about twenty minutes. The foot massage was even worse. Felt like i was getting tickled instead of massaged. There was no pressure at all. Would not recommend this place unless u want to waste an hour of your life.,1
I went to gourmet for my moms b day to surprise her ! I was making a dinner for my moms b day and I thought it would be cool to get some gourmet popcorn in as apps. Everyone loved it ! the banana and the chilli flavored popcorn is a must ! The white chocolate is my favorite ! Glad you are in las vegas !,2
"Incredibly fast and simple. I loved that everything was done via my scanner and the internet which meant no time missed from work. Their website was user friendly and their service excellent. I received email updates and real time information when I logged on to their site. I have already recommended their services to friends. Thank you Joseph R. Maridon, Jr., Esq.!",2
The food just wasn't that good.plain and simple. For the prices we paid it was a big disappointment. The night before we had eaten down the corridor at the Verandah and had an exceptional dinner with impeccable service. We are in Las Vegas every year on business and I will never go here again. Verandah on the other hand will be seeing me every year.,1
"When you first walk in the prices set you back a little, seeing as one slice and a drink run about five bucks. But take a look at the pictures on here before you leave due to pricing, because their serious slices are seriously huge. It did take a little to come out, but it was definitely worth it when it got there. It was the best pizza I've had in Phoenix, by far.",2
"The burgers, fries and shakes are mediocre far from great, not close to what should reasonably be expected from a so called ""celebrity "" chef. And, the set up is strange as well Order in the front and they bring it to you. So, if you want anything more we didn't you have to stand in line again. We wouldn't go back even if the meal were free.",1
"Really calm and clean facility, and the owners are super awesome! I taught with one of the owners previously, and I know based off experience they will only have amazing instructors. Alfredo is a fantastic instructor! Also, I am so excited to have cardio tramp available in this city. Great booty and leg workout!",2
"Lulu's is mediocre at best. I never understood why the place is always so crowded when there are so many better alternatives on that street like, little asia . Every time I've eaten there, it's been a bit of a disappointment and never a memorable thing. The only semi redeeming quality of this place is that the bubble tea is pretty good.",1
"Un d u00e9licieux tartare au thon que nous avons bien appr u00e9ci u00e9. Ce bistrot est une belle d u00e9couverte du quartier que nous n'avions jamais remarqu u00e9 auparavant pourtant, nous passons r u00e9guli u00e8rement sur l'avenue de l' u00c9glise ! nAgr u00e9able terrasse u00e0 l'arri u00e8re.",2
"I came in to have the nose pads replaced on my glasses. The girl at the front desk was rude, because apparently the nose pads are replaced for free. I didn't know, I expected to pay, I guess she was rude because she either needed a sneakers or no commission from the nose pads. 2 stars for being rude 5stars for the free pads.",1
"Barley's is a lot of fun, especially if you eat int he bar and lounge area. This is a great place to watch sports. The beers they brew on site, especially the Black Mountain Unfiltered are really good. The food is all pretty good and I've always enjoyed the service no matter what time of day I go in.",2
"Frequent visitor of this location. Usually a little bit of a line but manageable. They have a pretty good selection, not that I stray that much. Their coffee is pretty good, I like that I can refill it at my leisure. Like all Einsteins they put A LOT of cream cheese on the bagels, but its easy to spread off to your liking.",2
Negociants is a nice wee restaurant with delicious burgers. I especially like the bad boy burger which has everything inside even haggis and is enormous! I've also enjoyed their full scottish breakfast. The downside is that they usually are very slow in serving your food. apart from that everything is fine!,2
"Crappy, boring, limpid. The pastrami tasted bland, the bread was borderline stale and uninteresting, and the whole sandwich was a little wet and lukewarm. Got a Penn Pilsener from the bar, and it had the unmistakable taste of dirty lines a little sour tang of lactic bacteria. How is this place ""famous ""? Is it really? Can anyone please just brine some brisket and hand slice it?",1
"Best microbrew in AZ I've tried so far. I only had the Hop knot IPA however nInsanely packed at least 200 people loud atmosphere, no parking, a bathroom with 2 toilets minus a star nMenu limited to about 5 food items by sitting near the bar minus 2 stars nThat said the food and service was pretty respectable. nIf I go back it will be at off peak hours and or just to get a growler",1
"YIKES! Unimpressed. I have a pretty strong stomach and this place did not leave me feeling well. Maybe it was because of the overpriced food or the sugary drinks but either way. not good! I know Cabo Wabo is a chain so you can't expect gourmet food but for what I paid, I expected something edible. Our server was very nice and that was the only really postitive thing about this place.",1
"Clean, brightly lit and busy for being in a low visibility location. Mindy was really friendly, quick and neat. Got a single color mani pedi plus sugar for around 30 incl tip. Oh, and the massage chairs actually work really well. Kudos on something which seems to challenge a lot of other nail places.",2
"Awesome family owned Italian place! Service and food were excellent. Did not have to wait long for our food but yet so fresh with the homemade marinara sauce that is to die for. Great Happy Hour prices, and a good beer wine spirits selection. Will definitely be back. Nice to not be in a typical Scottsdale uptight fufu restaurant bar.",2
"Great service but my Rib Eye was overcooked, I knew I should have ordered ""rare "" instead of medium rare because what I got was ""medium "". The meat was hard to cut for a 65 dfollar steak and harder to chew than rib eye's I grill at home. Appetizers were good but not great. I didn't think it was a bad experience, but definitely nothing special other than really good service.",1
I loved Smeeks! If you're looking for a novelty birthday gift I would go here. They have such a fun assortment of items. They even have a wide variety of klutz books which were my favorite as a kid. As far as pricing. they seemed pretty reasonable to me. Nothing looked higher than it should be. I will definitely be going back.,2
"I don't even want to give this place one star! Ordered a pizza for delivery and they messed up my order for take out, so I said I will wait for fresh pizza and actually said I would wait however long it took l. for the fresh pizza. they show up a half an hour later with a crusty old pizza charge me full price. Way beyond disappointed with this franchise and their service!",1
"Pho Saigon 8 is one of my most recommended places to eat . Me and my family are regulars there, and their is a few waitresses who know that I love extra lime with my pho call me strange, but I absolutely love extra lime with my pho P . Whenever I go there I always feel comfortable and the food is always delicious. I love pho, aha .",2
Went to this place for my birthday with a party of about 12 after reading some fairly decent reviews about it. Took 20 minutes for a waiter to even acknowledge our presence and take our order. Food was decent but not worth the wait. Cocktails are HUUUGGEE and mostly ice and sugar with little to no alcohol. Still on a hunt for some decent Mexican food in Montreal.,1
We finally stopped in for Happy Hour and were impressed. We ordered the Big Ass Burger and the Green Chile Pork stew based on recommendations here and both were excellent. Portions are huge we ended up taking half of it home. Excellent drinks and very friendly professional service. We also liked the warm and inviting atmosphere in the bar. Great value too we were out the door for thirty bucks.,2
"Came here a handful of times recently. I sat at the bar and always have a fun bartender and friendly bartender helping me. The beer choices for Amber's Red's are not that great. The ones they do have range from Terrible to Middle level. In my beer book . They give you a ton of fries with your order. There isn't much option when it comes to the burgers, which is sad. I'd expect more from them.",2
"i've been to the sharp edge in friendship, but this is the first time i've been to the one downtown. it's pretty cool. i like the space much more, but everything else is about the same. i haven't eaten at this one although the food in friendship is amazing, so i'd venture to guess this one is too considering the menu is the same but i explored the draft list a bit more and was not disappointed.",2
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this office! During my high risk pregnancy I spent a lot of time at this office and in the hospital. Both Dr. Hahn and Dr. Spieker were fantastic, very knowledgable and easy to talk to. I trust them completly as they did everything to ensure both myself and my baby were well taken care of. I have since seen Dr. Cyr for a quick appointment whom is very sweet.",2
"This place is fantastic. Their baked goods are all excellent the BBQ pork buns and BBQ pork pastry are fantastic, the almond cookies are delicious, and I can't get enough of their wife cakes. The text on the pastries is a source of amusement for all who see it, but don't let that bother you it just makes the food tastier. The staff is also super friendly, which is an added bonus.",2
"My husband and I stopped here for a light breakfast, and were pleasantly surprised! We shared a mushroom omelette, which was excellent. It came with a small skewer of fruit, which we unfortunately had to throw out, as a fruit fly landed on it after we sat down. I had a caffe latte, which was good. The cheese danish we shared was also good. We will definitely return if we we stay in the Bellagio.",2
"I belive the reason for poor reviews is simple, poor quality of ingredients. The only decent thing on my plate was the chicken taco. I didn't realize they were charging me 3.99 for the bland guacamole. My server was on her cell phone when she delivered my salsa. I can see why thethe want a soul in the place",1
"I had such high hopes for this place. Been wanting to visit on my last couple of trips but never got around to it until today. Sadly, this place sucks. Not only are most of the employees rude, but they lack a general basic knowledge on anything nuclear related, and an even more distorted view on foreign policy. I would say don't waste your time. More of a out of the way overpriced tourist trap.",1
"The service and cleanliness of this theater has been on a downward projectory for sometime and tonight it may have hit rock bottom. Surly, rude ticket sellers combined with a theater kept too warm, and more popcorn on the floor than in the snack bar, all in all, not pleasant. Someone needs to hose that place down!",1
"We always stay at Ruby Foo's when we come to Montreal to visit family. While it's not downtown, it's a short walk to a metro station. It's clean, updated, quiet and the beds are comfy. There are also several eating place nearby Tim Horton's, Wendy's McDonalds, Burger King and my favorite Dunn's for smoked meat sandwiches. Another bonus is free parking.",2
"I love the Bird it's an egg white omelet with turkey, avocado, mushrooms boursin cheese . Actually, I order it as egg white, but it comes either way. This plus a side of fruit goes for 10.95. The Hyatt in Old Town serves free breakfast, yet, I continue to pay for the Breakfast Club.need I say more? Great service and ambiance, too.",2
I LOVE this place! Yummy ! I love the chicken Greek salad it's the best salad ever! Every time is like the first time this place is truly the best a must try everything is delicious . The owner is always friendly with a smile on her face. Every time I come she is here taking care of things . Plus their bathroom is super cute and clean.,2
Stopped by for a quick lunch on a Sunday. Parking lot didn't have many cars. Now I know why. This place needs a good cleaning inside and out . Parking lot had trash everywhere. I had to wipe the table off with a napkin before I could sit down. Staff didn't seem too interested in working if you know what I mean. Management must have taken the day off. I won't be back . Ever.,1
"Just got my first taste of Juicy Lotus' fare tonight. We took out for dinner, since we were both busy with school and work. We got a pad thai with tofu shrimp and green vegetable stir fry and it was delicious! yum! I can't wait to try more of their foods! this is a great and healthier alternative on a night that you are too busy to cook, but don't want to order something greasy.",2
"For those of you you who have had a bad experience at this restaurant in the past I encourage you to give it another try. I have been back three times since the grand reopening and wow, what a difference. The food and service has been top notch every time. Can't go wrong sea bass or macadamia chicken, both amazing dishes.",2
"I swear this place has a tractor beam installed, that's programmed for my vehicle. Every time I'm within a two mile radius, I find myself at their door, thirsty for a honeydew boba tea. If that isn't enough to make me completely blissful, I'll get a banh mi too. Too bad they don't seem to know what ""no cilantro "" means.",2
"Not the place to go if you are looking for service.? Or happy hour. nSamantha was no joy tonight, almost felt like she was not on the same planet. Maybe she was having a bad day.? Maybe she just doesn't have a desire to be in the hospitality industry, I don't know but I expect more from the staff tending the bar and I won't be back to this location because of the ""service "" I got tonight.",1
This place is really a dump. I have stayed at HIE hotels across the country and this is the worse by far. Room smelled so bad of deodorizer that my eyes stung. Carpets are dirty and room was small and cramped. WIFI worked part time and even when it worked it was slow. Very close to airport but that is about the only plus. I will not stay here again.,1
"I am have been here two times in 2 days. Yes, the food is that good. You may ask yourself why only 1 star then? The service here has been sub par on both occasions. My last vist was a togo order. The lady told me it would be ready in 20 minutes. It took them 45 minutes. So I waited on a chair outside in the cold. nDONT EVER ORDER FOOD TOGO!",1
"I come regularly with my family. Over all the food is good but they charge for tortilla chips and I have never seen that before. I had the chicken flauta combo, the rice and beans were delicious but the flauta didn't have any favor to it. The guacamole would be better if they didn't add tomatoes to it and just kept it avocado only.",1
"With Lenny's and Lucky's being so close, the burgers here are a late night compromise, only. I'd rather have a side of peanuts over the soggy fries that is, if they'd let you. And really, their burgers are really just an expensive version of something you'd expect to get from a campground grill or the high school cafeteria.",1
We were in town and were lucky enough to have a friend bring us for Sunday football. The casino was clean and comfortable and with 1.00 beers and hot dogs you really can't go wrong. This is the kind of place that I would like to have down the street from me just to go hang out. I didn't do any gambling so I don't know how they pay out but I would like to come back sometime and give it a shot.,2
"I dropped in on a recommendation for a place to get a quick, cheap meal. This is what I got when I ordered the steak special, which is a 10oz steak, vegetable, and baked potato, all for under 8. The steak was a bit overcooked and tough, and the rest was unremarkable. nI got what I paid for, and considered giving the place 3 stars for value alone hey . . . its an EIGHT DOLLAR steak.",1
"We typically order Oliveo's when we are sick of the food around our office on Mill Ave. Today, I ordered the Cyprus salad with chicken. When I picked up my order and got back to my office no chicken on my salad. When I called, they asked me if I would like to come and pick up a side of chicken after I waited quite a long time to receive my salad. A bad lunch is worsened by bad customer service.",1
Worse food worse service by old waiter with absolutely no personality. He was either a mad Mexican or bitter Arab.no smile no manners. Weird old goat.wouldnt accept coupon on phone and I still left him a 4.00 tip.never going back.Luke warm food and Everything is over 9.00 when did eggs become so frigging expensive ?,1
"As far as smog checks go, this place gets the job done. There are 2 lanes and it's a very smooth process. You can get in and out in 5 minutes. They send out a mailer with a coupon when it's time for my renewal from the DMV. It's 16 for the check and they will also renew your registration on site. I always do it from home but it's an option.",2
Melinda and Rick were awesome. We had no idea what to expect and they provided great service and made the whole process so easy and convenient. The whole thing was very quick and affordable. Would def recommend them to anyone to wants to a smooth process! They are super close to the marriage bureau too!,2
"Beautiful hotel with a beautiful view. It is right next to the convention center, so we were able to walk to our event. We got a room last minute for 77 with the AAA discount. Valet parking, great service, amazing beds and updated rooms bathrooms. This hotel seemed 5 star on the inside. The employees were very friendly and professional.",2
"Oh.this place has very rude waitress.we politely asked for an extra empty plate for my toddler , she responded very rudely saying I have only have two hands OK.wow so much attitude for asking an extra empty plate.my kids are taken by surprise with this kind of rudeness.of course we are never going to return this place again ever.",1
"This is the 2nd time I've been to this CVS. The staff is always pleasant. This time I went in for passport photos. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. Although I'm not always crazy about CVS' prices as a whole, I found a 2 off coupon online for the photos. I'll be sure to check online for coupons more often.",2
"There is horrible place, I came for pedicure and they charge too much but didn't massage that long. They tried to make me do expensive pedicure w parapin wax and I saw they reuse the old one that they used for the customer before me. You can get fungus from that, very dirty place too, I refused that and never come back again, waste money and time.",1
I'd give ZERO stars if I could figure out how! Absolute scam company. nOversees workers talk over you so quickly and never answer your questions. They hang up on you if you request to much information. They refused to cancel my card upon request until I demanded someone in the states. Once I did that they transferred me to another oversees person who started they would cancel my account.,1
"The prices here are cheap, but you don't even get what you pay for. Everything tastes like it was frozen, freezer burned, then fried, and I felt a bit of apprehension bringing certain items to my mouth. The famous fish sandwiches are large, but not worth ordering more than once. Note this is a rating of the food alone. I didn't drink here, nor did I attend any musical events.",1
"I had been going here for my haircuts since it opened. After 20 30 haircuts I found out that I had been overcharged. I noticed the price kept increasing. Each time, I was told that it was a corporate increase. It started at 20 for a men's cut. 2 years later, I was being charged 40. It was a great haircut, but now I go to Sport Clips.",1
"I had the boneless ribeye, good steak that you can probably get almost anywhere. The chili is really good as well. I would say that for the same price you can probably get twice as much food at another steakhouse. The prices are a bit over the top because they have a couple of organic beef options and they also have the Kobe beef which in my opinion it is overpriced.",1
All I have to say is 12.95 all you can eat chicken wings. I came in on a Wednesday around 3 p.m. and there was no line or wait to get my order in. This place had great food and a great atmosphere. The employees and management were great and checked in on my party to ensure that everything was to our liking!,2
"Carpet has intense odor of beer other things spilled on it. If you like microwave frozen food, you'll love it here. There's something ""going on "" in this place, like if I found out that there was 400 pounds of marijuana in the basement, it wouldn't surprise me. I think this is a hang out for local residents that are not allowed in casinos.",1
When the Yelpers say half as much food for twice as much money you should listen. Two bean rice burritos mostly rice lettuce seriously lacking beans sour cream a tiny tiny fits into a styrofoam fries container bean tostada 20 some bucks. No guac two thimblefuls of salsa. Coming from So Cal. we miss the previous owner! Total ripoff.,1
Horrible club. Horrible layout. Dance floor is small and overcrowded. Hip hop planned ALL night. Gross! Good thing my party and I got in free. We left just after being there for one hour. Found a lounge at the mandalay bay hotel that was 100 better. Next time my time will not be wasted at LAX that's for damn sure.,1
"Straight up this Buffet kinda sucks.sorry Aria, I gave you 5 stars as a hotel casino but your Buffet blows. Food was all kinda over cooked and crusty, sushi was gross, they have some kinda Indian tandoori station that was awful.the only saving grace was the desert section. Next time I will just hit the cafe or one of the other 7 restaurants in the place.or even just order room service.",1
The most awful experience I've ever had at a bar. Ordered cheese curds and it took more than an hour for them to come. The manager threatened to kick me out because I expressed my displeasure that my food was taking forever. Are you kidding me? NEVER go here for food. Only take advantage of their power hour specials.that's all Nitty is good for. AWFUL EXPERIENCE,1
"A friend brought me here for my birthday, but unfortunately, I loathed this show! It was extremely boring and the story is absolutely confusing with people simply swimming jumping to and fro. The acrobatics are not as good as Cirque nor is the ambiance. Cirque is to Disneyland as Le Reve is to Legoland.",1
"was there for lunch, nothing spectacular . decent price though. nonly reason I tried it because we stayed at treasure island hotel an got a buy one get one free coupon. We paid like 20 pp. decent decoration place. for a good hotel, like TI this buffet is waaaaayyyyy below spectations. I WILL NOT RECOMEND THIS TO ANYBODY MUCH LESS COMING BACK !",1
"I love this place. I've been there several times and the food service is always awesome. The bread they serve is the best I've ever tasted, the portions are huge considering their modest pricing, and the couple that runs it are always pleasant. They obviously take pride in what they do, and rightfully so. They're my favorite breakfast brunch spot.",2
FYI.they say they deliver and even step you through delivery process offering menu and step by step process. After finishing order had to call with question and the girl informs me they don't deliver! Ugh.then please don't offer thru yelp. Emily informed me their website is under construction! Still think they should remove offer that they deliver at least on yelp.,1
"Unfortunately, I found nothing good from this place. The musubi fell apart and I could taste it's from dry leftover rice. The magic boba isn't boba at all. The french donut is probably the only good thing but it took them more than 20 minutes to get my order of 3 items and I'm the only customer in the store.",1
"Holly really cares about your hair! And like other reviews said, she's not scissor happy. I have long, thick hair and she doesn't cut more than I ask which is a great relief. She really takes the time to listen about what you want. I love the results every time I go to her for either cuts, trims, and color!",2
We came here for the burgers and they were good but not the best we have had. They do have an awesome variety of beers including Prohibition and Stone from our local area of San Diego. We went to watch the Monday night football game and don't recommend it. I would go to a different place to watch games. But food was good and beer was also.,2
This is actually a review of Dagwoods' Laval location but I imagine they're quite similar. It was eerily like Subway but fewer choices of toppings. They did slice the cheese which is a plus but not enough to offset the mediocre taste. It was serviceable for getting a sandwich to go but definitely would not stop there again.,1
"Absolutely beautiful jewelry! I've only seen this store when I was on the Big Island of Hawaii, and now it's here in Vegas. Definitely look at the Mother of Pearl items. There are some gorgeous, intricately carved pieces. I just wanted earrings and ended up getting a necklace to match. Pretty, shiny things courteous, yet not pushy service a happy girl.",2
We were not impressed. When we came in the lady seamed nice tell she asked if we has reservations .we said no is that a problem ?she didn't answer us .she was very put off because we didn't have any .over half the tables were empty.I had pesto and pasta very bla. My husband had cannoli the meat in it tasted bad.there house dressing is pretty much oil with a splash of vinegar.,1
"I really enjoy the Vegetable Omelet! I find I miss it when I visit other restaurants. It is always fluffy, full of crunchy vegetables like broccoli, mushrooms, onions and tomatoes. Plus just the right amount of cheese. I add a side of there bacon, the French Press Coffee and BOOM! Perfect breakfast !",2
"What can I say? Went with a friend and my daughters to have lunch at the Olive Garden, we went for the all you can eat pasta bowl with salad and bread sticks! Lunch was very good, service was fast and friendly, only hold up was bread sticks were cooking but it just meant they were fresh from the oven! Great lunchtime with the gals!",2
"Can't go wrong with 1.99 domestic drafts from 1 7am. I usually come here once a week with my coworkers after a long shift. Great prices and food, the only downside to it being that you're sitting in a Buffalo Bills bar P A trip to Stake Out requires one to order the chicken wings or the philly cheesesteak accompanied with a Miller Lite. 'Murca.",2
When I got to Scottsdale a couple of my art pieces needed reframing. Took them here and Michael the guy at the framing department helped pick out exactly what worked. Love that guy and love my art even more now that it looks so fab on the wall. Will do more framing with Michael at Michael's. PS no relation to the store.,2
"I was thrilled Rachel's Kitchen opened this location! I love their fresh healthy options. I met a friend here for lunch, her salad arrived promptly and my grilled chicken sandwich 440 sandwich and garden salad came out shortly thereafter. I normally get their roasted veggie sandwich but the chicken was good, I deducted a star because I felt like it had been grilled previously and just heated up.",2
"They are now serving full breakfast so we decided to try it. NOT GOOD! The guys working were nice but the breakfast wasn't good. Eggs were over cooked, toast was burnt and the ""hash browns "" are nothing I have ever seen before and didn't taste good either. The prices are similar to good breakfast places like New Day, Coco's, Etc.",1
I must say Radio Milano was my all time FAVORITE restaurants in phoenix which I never reviewed because everyone already knew how fabulous it was. Logging into today to realize the venue change has left me somewhere between completely inconsolable and totally suicidal. WHY WHY WHYYYYYY would you do that to us LGO! I HATE SUSHI! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!,1
"Huge lunch rush on a Friday and I was in and out of there. I always look for an American drive thru type. They remind me of growing up in Washington, NJ where we had Stewart's. the burger, dog and fries were delicious today. A big shout out to the whole crew there for running a well chaos ed hot spot.",2
"Our first time there was not pleasant. We both had clam chowder, the fried cod, and parmesan fries. The clam chowder was chewy. The fish was soggy and cold. The fries were decent. The service was poor. Tried a beer and did not like it, told the waitress and she did not care nor take it off our bill. The atmosphere is not for us. Will not be going back.",1
The wait staff was nice. I ordered a burger that came with a moldy bun. When I told the waitress the cook only sent me a fresh bun rather than remaking the burger. I refused to eat it a got a hassle when I told them I wasnt going to pay. On the way out I peeked in the kitchen. It was dirty. Not just new dirt but nasty buildup around the grill and fryers.,1
"The hummus was gravy, the pita bread came right from the store bought package, and the chicken shawarma tasted like nothing. Sad face. Customer service was excellent! Very nice Persian family runs this spot. I got my order in right away and they were very helpful. But the dish was so awful I thanked them quickly and had to run out for plan B meal cuz I just cannot stomach the food.",1
"I initially learned about Body Heat from my friend who suggested we purchase Groupons together. After my first class I was hooked! Body Heat is like going to a resort Spa. The facilitiy is always clean and no ""funky "" smell here! All of the instructors are top notch and will kick you butt into shape. Since June I have lost 5 pounds and inches all thanks to Karly her team at Body Heat ",2
Service was excellent but the food not so good. My husband had biscuits and gravy and the gravy was cold. They only make one size of pancake which was way too big for my granddaughter so more than half of it went to waste. Neither me or my granddaughter like the taste of the sausage or thst went to waste too.,1
"3x is the charm slide in the resturant, good band, and to top it off, view of the valley as a major thunder lighting storm rolled in! Its cliche, its goofy and you drink out of mason jars, but if you are looking for a bit of silly, I really enjoy it I've been for drinks, with the family on a date all times were entertaining the staff is friendly!",2
"I've been wanting to go here for a awhile but the line is always out the door and after finally eating there tonight I'm not sure why. The food is mediocre at best in all honesty it tastes and looks like the food was microwaved. My girlfriend remarked on our way out that ""the best part of the meal was the after dinner mint "" Save your money for Carrabba ""s which has much better food.",1
"FANTASTIC, AMAZING, AWESOME! Right now the is dark, but I had the chance to see La Reve prior to it going dark for changes. What a privilege. The performers are stupendous. I may be biased because I know several of the performers, but this show is worth EVERY PENNY! Great fro kids over 10. See it the next time you're here in Sin City!",2
I looked up this place for the fried gizzards and fried mushrroms. However i found it to be so much more. Great people working there and a very very clean place. The nice man that helped us behind the counter came out and cheacked on us a number of time. If you want a nice good downhome lunch with some nice good old downhome food this is your place.,2
"Very tasty, service was not very good or I'd give it 5 stars server was not very good. Their jalepeno cream cheese dip is excellent! My fiance even liked the food and he doesn't really like Mexican. Its kind of more like tex mex than Mexican food. They give you huge portions. It's not too expensive either kind of like a family dining experience.",2
This location always makes my flavored drinks the best they may have different names for the drinks I normally order but they are super nice at explaining it that way I know they are going to serve the right drink. Kudos to this location and the young manager I dealt with when my order was difficult.,2
Dr. Nair Borges ! Omg she is the sweetest and most helpful doctor! everyone was so helpful and i am so happy with the service they gave me I spent a little too much over my budget for a pair of prescription glasses but everything was worth it. i will highly recommend Dr. Nair Borges to everyone i know! Thank you so much Dr. Nair Borges and Optic Gallery for taking good care of me!,2
This location has changed my experience with Dr. Izenberg. He is the only reason I am now a patient at this office. Previously there wasn't much wait and things went smoothly at his old location. At the new location I wasn't able to see the Dr. Until 1.5 hours after my scheduled appt. think twice before scheduling if you have other things you need to accomplish that day.,1
"Refreshing change from Scottsdale prices, over the top complexity and congestion. u00dcber simple, almost plain Jane, decor is misleading. Nice wine list, tho light on French wines. Nice beer list. Mix and match menu with reasonable prices complementary valet parking. AND, 5 wine before 5 PM each day. I'd be inclined to try their weekend brunch it time permits some trip. I'll come back for sure.",2
"I love the restaurants at the Cosmo, especially Comme Ca and Scarpetta. The chandelier bar is the perfect place to get together with friends and enjoy some nice cocktails, although on the weekend it may be a bit hard to hear each other. A great spot for locals on the weekdays to bar hop and enjoy great cocktails.",2
"Loved it. nI'd like to see it again and again and again and again. I didn't want it to end. We were probably the furthest seats possible, and I wasn't too disappointed. We were able to see the stage in its entirety, which is something the front rows probably didn't get to experience. Loved it. nNext time I will probably try and get an aisle closer seat though. It's totally worth the money.",2
"Ordered this last Friday night. It was cheap, delicious, and literally only took like 15 20 minutes to get to us. I ordered the kung pao chicken and my boyfriend got the general tsos chicken. Both were good and had a good level of spiciness. I liked the egg rolls too, the combo is a good, cheap deal. Anyway, we'll be ordering from here again because it was sooo fast. I love that!",2
"DO NOT GO IF YOU HAVE EXTENSIONS! This girl tossed my hair so much while shampooing it got so tangled and matted. Then even after I mentioned ""why don't you just use a detangler "" she ripped through my hair with a brush pulling and tugging! She even pulled out like 4 of my extensions! I have the plastic tube extensions shrinkies too so they're very easy to wash and style.",1
I am confident that this place will garner a fifth star with subsequent visits. My problem is that I caever make it past the bakery counter. My sweet tooth always takes over and by the time it is satisfied I haven't the appetite to try the more savory options. This place maintains its authenticity while creating an atmosphere that would rival anything put out by Fox or Upward Projects.,2
Cash patients pay a fee of 70. At no time do they tell you it's more per visit until you get the bill in the mail 30 days later. 70 is a copayment even though they make you believe that's the total payment. I don't like the service. The doctors don't care and are completely smug and insensitive to cost,1
This was dead. I understand it's a Wednesday but there was a couple and me that's it. Staff was super friendly. I wasn't impressed with the selection of rolls and lack a sashimi combos. Most of the rolls I ordered were dosed in sauce. nNot fair to write a review of the place a week after I had the best sushi of my life in New York.,1
"Extremely slow service, hostess and manager were both rude. I noticed that 2 tables that sat after we did got served first. 4 out of every 10 people that walked in, walked right back out once they saw the line. We waited 35 minutes for a table. This was my first and last time at this over priced Denny's",1
"Went here with my wife and 2 kids for my birthday dinner. They serve several different cuisines and I tried a bit of everything. We were pleasantly surprised how good the food was. Among the highlights were crab legs and lobster claws. Lots of people were getting platefuls of these, but at no point we're they even close to running out.they just kept it coming. We will definitely be back.",2
"My wife and I stopped in yesterday. It was nice to be back in the area. Their pizza is as good as it gets their salads are awesome too! I loved the Founder's smoked porter.the scotch ale by House of Brews not so much. Adam and Dave are uniquely different bartenders, but both kick ass in their own unique ways. ",2
Had a facial with Yvonne and she was amazing! Must get the full facial with extractions because she definitely works on your face! She uses natural products as well so that's a plus! I also had a haircut by Elaine and I will definitely come back just because of her! The cut and the color was just perfect !,2
What can you say about a stop at Home Depot? I was out of kitchen flood light bulbs. I had another stop in this area so I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone. There were few customers and parking was close to the entrance. The door opened directly on the lighting aisle so I didn't have far to go. The self checkout was a breeze and I was on my way in less than 5 minutes. That's really good!,2
I called in my order and it was done by the time I got there about 10 minutes later. Very fast and efficient It's fast Chinese food but it's better than the Panda Express type places. I enjoyed the crab rangoon especially. Make sure to ask for sweet and sour sauce if you order the crab rangoons as it is not assumed.,2
Came here for my cousins wedding who would have thunk to have a reception at a brewery!? This place was AWESOME. We had the left side of the brewery reserved with the outdoor deck which was perfect Beer was delicious and heavy and the service was great! We also was able to tour the brewery way cool.,2
"Worst Ross I've ever been to. A total MESS! Nothing was organized, I felt like half the merchandise had just been tossed on the floor. I could hardly find anything. nNo customer service. Nothing memorable really. Except the fitting room ladies seemed annoyed to be there. nI don't blame them. nAlso, this was possibly one of the most ghetto stores I've ever shopped at.",1
"I was willing to accept the expensive, mediocre boba tea. I was also willing to accept the 20 minute wait both times I ordered. What I'm not willing to accept is that the cashier told me they were out of boba. I ordered tea anyway. The people who ordered before me got boba, which makes sense. However, the couple that ordered after I did got boba too. So they were only out of boba for my drink?",1
"This has to be one of the best malls ive ever been in, only in Vegas. It is huge, they have this weird parking setup which makes it pretty easy to get back to your car. they got a lot of really fancy stores and a lot of tourists. It has this huge runway that has shows every now and then. items are pretty reasonably priced and its definitely a mall id check out again.",2
"I was entirely disappointed in this place. I took a date here for dinner and the service was simply atrocious, food and drinks took forever to come out, and the food was subpar at best. This seems like a great place to watch sports as there are several big screen televisions, nice big bar, but for dinner, go elsewhere.",1
With all the hype before this place even opened I epxected a whole lot better. There are so may flavors lacking in the basic tacos. The tamales are so generic and dry. nThe place is nice and clean and the staff is friendly and the little salsa bar is a nice addition which I had to give this place 2 stars. If you want geat tacos go to Gallo Blanco or to Americas.,1
"This place is delicious. You pick your choice of meat chicken, steak, ground beef, pork and others they place it in a corn tortilla for you and the rest is up to you. They have many choices at the salsa bar. You can go mild or very hot. All tacos are 2.50 each. They take cash or you can go inside the store and pay with a credit card.",2
"This place just screams tourist trap, from the absurdly high ticket prices to the dozens and dozens of stalls and vendors trying to sell you stuff. The Skywalk is not as cool as it sounds, and if you've already seen the Grand Canyon from another viewing area like Grand Canyon Village , it definitely isn't worth it to do this tour as well.",1
"Bartenders are not personable, and I've been here multiple times. Save your money for a fun bar and leave these douchebags alone. Maybe then they will be more appreciative of new business Also, i have heard nothing but rotten things about their st pattys day festival of overpriced admission and drinks.",1
"If you are a spiritual seeker, you will love this group. Every Sunday is an uplifting experience! This is what church should be like. Don't take my word for it, go see for yourself they are very open to new members . If you enjoy such authors such as Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra, Louise Hay, and everyone from ""The Secret "" you will fit right in. A ",2
"A very reliable and honest company. Highly recommend this company to anyone needing a c repair. Also would like the company know about the excellent technician that was sent to my place. Very punctual, honest, professional and knows his business inside and out. Hope the company appreciates such a model employee. His name is Robert. Simply the best. Will recommend this company to all of my friends.",2
"He's a rude motherphucker! lol Seriously, doesn't know how to say hello to his customers or acknowledge a ""thank you "". I'll use him in a pinch, but there is so much better pizza out there from people that at least attempt to be personal. Anywho, it's cheap if you carry out. Otherwise, go somewhere else.",1
"A. It's a mansion. B. Once inside, you'd never know you're in Vegas. C. When the waiter asks you if you'd like to upgrade your 38 flank steak sandwich to the filet, don't be a jerk. do the smart thing. When you're ready to hob knob with the elite, and you have an invite, look not behind you and charge forward to this gem at the MGM.",2
"I had such high hopes for this place but it was not good at all. This is the only time that I have left my table at a restaurant to go to the bar to get a refill on my soda. The bartender shot our server some nasty looks but he apparently didn't care. We ordered two sets of nachos, one chicken and one beef, and they were comparable to what one would have at Taco Bell. Pass.",1
"Amazing venue and great people. We did a Drive Thru wedding and expected it to be average at best. They blew us away. They were so sweet, so caring and really made the wedding special. We got all the perks, the best photos ever and really had a romantic wedding, which is hard to accomplish in a Drive Thru wedding. The ladies at the Wedding Chapel really knew how to make it special.",2
Went on the south rim tour yesterday. Tour was good price paid was 142 per person for 3 of us. Found out that the tour was only 80 per person when booked on website. Called company and got blew of saying that there affiliated brokers are allowed to charge what they want. I would not deal with this company as they are shady to to say the least.,1
"Must try! Being from Los Angeles where there is a ton of amazing food options, I was surprised there weren't a lot of hip brunch options in Phoenix, but thanks to yelp, I found this spot! Great, amazing, scrumptious food! To top it off, the service is phenomenal! If I'm ever in Phoenix again, this is the one stop I am adding to my list.",2
"I've been to this place many times and it has changed hands but is always great service and food are as good as any Thai I've ever had. All the curries are good, the larb, spicy mint dishes, and my new fav is eggplant delight all good choices.The sauces are broth like, not thick and gravy like. I can't comment on their Chinese food I always order Thai.",2
"Always a good place to get filled up twice even sometimes. Service at this location has always been the best out of any location I've been to. I really wish they still had the Mole and a few other choices that made this place unique. Hands down though, this will always beat some other greasy fast food place if you are in a hurry. Oh yeah, 1 taco's on Tuesday's make for a great, quick, cheap meal.",2
"I give the food at paradise bakery 5 stars the service at this location, however, is horrible. They have gotten my order coworkers orders wrong on multiple occasions. They are often cold unfriendly. I have visited many other locations have not had this problem. It's unfortunate that I often take my business elsewhere due to the staff.",1
I had water damage due to a home flood and this company was excellent in every way. An associate from the company met me at my home and arranged for the team to come back at a time convenient for me. The Team was extremely professional and best of all hard working. The team did an excellent job communicating with me as well as my insurance. This process was smooth sailing thanks to Thistle.,2
Never are stocked with plates. The place is messy and the food is really bland. For a place that claims to have such a variety of food you would think there would be some choices. I can go elsewhere and spend at least 10 less and have a much better variety and overall dinning experience. Our waitress was pleasant though both in service and in looks.,1
"Food was delicious! 5stars for their pizzas. 3 star service. Slow and forgettful.I don't think its the waiters fault.looked like they were understaffed today. Maybe bc od holiday season. nWe got the white garlic 16'pizza with pepperoni, italian sausage, basil, tomatoes. I shared with my husband.we both loved it and its plenty for two people to share. nMediterranean salad was great too.",2
"Damm nPlace looks good, but my order has hair in it , I know it can be worse. but it was very disappointing to find a long strand of hair inside my sandwich. The waitress was apologetic and the manager Dnt even apologize, he just return my money back , he is very rude. ni felt really gross out afterwards. Very bad experience.",1
"At 6, these sandwiches are a tasty way to get small bills for tipping, and you'll need a lot more of those all the time. I definitely enjoyed the sandwiches I got here including, of course, the Full Montagu . Good quick food, and helpfully cheaper than a lot of the other options around. Still quite corporate and sanitized, as is the way of things on the Strip.",2
"I am soo disappointed! I was so excited to find a cute little cafe near my daughters school. Ordered the Super Bird to go and I was utterly disgusted. Took a bite and spit it out, which I never waste food like that. The Turkey was gamy and tasted like I was eating rotten turkey. I was so disappointed I payed for it. I will not go back. Ugh. I still have a terrible taste from it.",1
"the food here is horrible. The crab rangoon had almost zero filling, the hot sour soup was thick jelly ish with zero flavor and the fried rice was basically white rice saut u00e9ed in oil soy sauce for color no pork, shrimp or veggies to speak of . Eat anyplace else with any rating you'll be better off!",1
"Maybe 2 1 2 stars. The food is not warm but tastes okay. There is a great selection. The sushi had been sitting out for awhile so I bypassed it. The staff all seem to not know what is going on, but that might just be because it's new. Kid friendly so I'm sure the hubs will make us come back, unfortunately.",1
"Reasonably priced breakfast buffet however, the buffet out of all hotel buffets on the strip is considered in my opinion as I'd say lower quality compared to for example the Mandalay bay. Food kinda blows and if you want breakfast here, you better come early to snag a table otherwise you'll be waiting forever.",1
"I have been here twice with my sister when we visited Vegas. The breakfast is great, I usually get the buttermilk pancakes which are HUGE, I usually never finish them. The last time I went, for Christmas, I got them with strawberries inside. Its one of our go to places for breakfast when we visit! The only downside was on our last visit it took a long time for us to get our food ",2
"Best cut and color I've ever had! I went from broken damaged bleach blonde to adding lowlights via miss Unique and I absolutely love it! I've had more compliments on my hair than ever! Definitely made this big girl feel beautiful! Staff was beyond friendly too! For being a first time client, I felt like I had been going there for years!",2
McCarraeeds better signs for where airlines are! Terminal 3 is for international flights I think. Go to terminal 1 if you're looking for Southwest. Good to know when you and your friends are hungover from a crazy night trying to get you to your flight on time! 2 stars only because they seemed thorough at security n GET THOSE SIGNS UP McCARRAN!,1
I had big expectations. People love this place. I liked it. I was told I had to get the wonton appetizer. It was good but the sauce was too sweet. That seemed to be the theme throughout the meal overly sweet sauces that over powered the dish. Service was good. Ambiance was very similar to the Italian restaurant that was in there years ago.,1
"had many pints here during my 9 night stay in Edinburgh. bar staff was very friendly and they have great selection of ales. this pub is very popular with locals and tourist. noise level is high, but in good way. everyone was having fun. tried the sea bass for dinner and i would say it was OK. my friends enjoyed their meals more that i did.",2
Pure Bliss I haven't had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time. The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent. You MUST try the Yin Yang Martini! It was a very creative and well presented drink that had me all smiles. nI had the Smores Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite I've tried at least 5 others .,2
"This place has the best Italian food in the city! The service is awesome, Chef Marc himself comes out to your table and with great detail, explains the items on the menu. nMy top recommendations would be the Pork Chop El Chico, the Antipasto salad, minestrone soup for lunch , and my favorite Linguine Cioppino! You cant go wrong with anything on the menu ",2
"Overpriced for the portion quality of the food, but no doubt because it's in Planet Hollywood. Worse service ever. Friends and I arrived at 2am for a quick snack after flying in late and before gambling some, the place was empty, we orders a few appetizers and didn't get out of the place for 2.5 hours because we were waiting for service. It should not take 30 minutes to bring my check. Skip it!",1
"I can't understand why this place gets such high ratings. The burgers are just not good. The meat was flavorless and tasted low quality. The fries and tots were ok, but nothing special. The worst part was the service we waited an hour to receive our burgers. The only highlight was the Jamaican corn side dish. I would not return.",1
"2 stars because it's good, cheap, food. Not amazing food, but free refrills on my orange juice.excellent! Only had brunch here, but everything was good. Service was amazing, considering my mother was speaking Italian with the waiter. nI was a little sad that they charged to see the cars.but I guess it would have just been a tease if I touched them.",1
"I feel funny leaving a review for Panda Express, but I was so pleased with the quality of the food that I feel this is deserved. If you go during lunch or dinner, the food is always hot and fresh. The service is good and the restaurant is clean. Their staff is also very friendly. Naturally, I usually get Orange Chicken and it's awesome!",2
Great for families with children. Nice pool area and plenty of on site activities. The rooms are really nice. The washer machine and dryer aren't that great. They both take forever and the settings are hard to understand. They have a shuttle that makes trips to and from the strip. It would be great if it ran later. It would also be great if it dropped off at Mandalay bay.,2
"These G Damn A holes have been phone spamming me for the past year. Over 12 calls despite my number being on the Do Not Call list for over 2 1 2 years. I've asked them to stop calling me and the crabby old B! that answers their phone lies claims they always check the DNC list. BS, you old hag. F Desert Valley Aire and the rock they live under. You pissed of the wrong mullet, mother effers.",1
"Worst customer service of all time from Pharmacist Shawn Earl who not only screwed up my GF's order, he put his prissy hands on his hips and acted like a 5 year old or Pee Wee Herman. Two other customers behind us also filed complaints. Seriously folks.do not let this guy interact with customers or he might get hurt!",1
"I am Cantonese I exactly know what wontooodle soup should look like. It's fine if you make a different type of wonton soup, but you should not use the name of "" Hong Kong "", Hong Kong or Cantonese wontooodle soup should use Cantonese noodle not the north china noodle, wonton should have shrimp in it, the soup should made of some beef or chicken or fish broth.",1
This place is great! I enjoyed the flavor of every meal on the table. Probably the best guacamole I have ever had. The only thing I will complain about is the price for what you get. It's very high for the quantity of food. If that does not phase you then by all means this is a great place. Try the ghost pepper sauce!,2
If you want a quality massage do not go here. He has poor customer service and does not massage any muscles. It feels like he is slopping oil all over with an occasional hot stone. I've had several massages and never have I had one so bad that I would not recommend the person doing it. I bought this as a groupon and I felt that I overpaid for the service.,1
"Sola is near my office which is hardly the only reason I visit this wonderful coffee shop, it is the process by which the Sola staff makes the coffee. The beans are ground right before the coffee is made which makes for a delicious cup of joe. The staff is friendly, the beans are fresh and the pastries are quite good. Free wifi is available too!",2
"Wish there was a ""no "" star rating. This "" so called "" professional doesn't show up! My niece is trying to get herself into regular therapy. She has been blown off in so many ways. Appointments set up. And, a no show from this therapist. No shows, regularly. Not sure how she made it to her regularly scheduled classes to pass her exams to be in this role. Geeeez",1
"The only heist here is what happens to your wallet. n01 The ""beer "" is watered down. 02 This place is more a restaurant than brewery. Not my kind of restaurant at that. Go somewhere else first. 03 Expect high prices and little portions of food. 04 You can't just ""sit at the bar. "" They want to serve you at a table like a restaurant.",1
"We experienced good food here before but tonight was not good! The bread was rubbery feeling and boiling hot.like it just was reheated in the microwave! Then, I get chicken marsala and it was a watered down, buttery sauce, no idea where the marsala was! I hope this was just an off night and the quality will come back up.",1
"There's an interesting variety of sushis, burgers, and burgushi. I thought the burgushi was good but it's not something I would spend money all all the time since the portion is small. The burgers are good though and their fries goes perfectly with it. I like how the place looks also. If you're in the South Park area give it a try",2
"I live in the area and wanted to try this place for ever. I love Montreal's old school diners, and this one had that feel. But nice and friendly inside too. Ordered 7 "" sub, onion rings, and a beer, and loved it. Server was super friendly. Filling portions for reasonable prices. Full bar. Cool place. I'll definitely return.",2
"Boo bestbuy. You are a major inconvinience for me. And your employees are brain dead. I only like the fact that you are close to my house, but that sorta doesn't count anymore because Circuit city is now closer to me. You know best by, your not the best and maybe I don't wanna buy from you anymore! Why don't you put that in your back pocket?",1
"M M world is pretty incredible as you might expect. They have so many options for color and flavors and peanuts and peanut butter and mixed. It is mind boggling. They have great gift ideas too for your friends who didn't make it to Vegas. As always, the single special color M Ms are expensive, but for some reason they taste better when you choose the exact hue of your chocolatey treat ",2
"Literally the worst service I've ever had, anywhere. I spent more time in line than actually eating. Everyone behind the counter was extremely rude, short, and clearly upset about something. Food was mediocre at best and it's a shame, because I actually really like Cafe Rio. Stay away from this location.",1
Terrible service. I am a regular here. And I get treated like garbage. I understand barry is playing. But come on you guys are not that busy. I have been getting better service at other lounges. I understand you guys close at 12. But dont bother me with the bill ill pay when I want to. do not rush me. To be honest I rate a 0. Its not the same without Joe.,1
"Points for being independent and struggling to fight the nasty chains that plague our city. But c'mon. The food really is pretty ordinary. I challenge anyone to say it's unique or tasty. And more importantly, service is always important. It's NOT cool to be that laid back. Maybe on a beach in Thailand but not when trying to run an eatery in Central Phoenix. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day.",1
"I'm giving this place an extra star because their beef jerky appetizer was delicious but sadly all the other dishes were bland and lacking a true Thai flare. We ordered the Tom Yum soup, Pad Woon Seoodles, and mixed vegetables with beef. The meat in all of the dishes weren't seasoned and to me unseasoned meat yuck. We'll only come back here to get the beef jerky To Go.",1
Today was my first experience with Dr. Melissa. Loved the office staff and Dr. Melissa was VERY thorough! I am diabetic and have never had such a thorough exam as this one! I was recommended by my neighbor who is also diabetic. I am so glad I went! The last eye Dr. I went to never did get my glasses right. So far I have been HIGHLY impressed with AZ Eye Health!,2
"I placed my order and asked for no peas in my fried rice to which I was told, ""it's already made "" HUH? MAJOR turn off and this is why I will not return because your rice is prepared prior to opening. Portions are incredibly small. Service was ok even though the man got smart with me when I asked what he recommended.",1
"Went in and was a little overwhelmed with the huge menu. When we asked our waitress for suggestions she asked us what we liked, after we all described what we were looking for she said ""ok "" and left to put our orders in. Within minutes we all had huge dishes of exactly what we each were looking for. Great service, great food we'll be back! This place is almost dangerous it's so good!",2
"I told the salesman to go F k his self and walked out with out my gifts! Need I say more? He then got even ruder and I told him "" Hey boss say one more word to me and I'm going to jail and you are going to the Hospital! "" Don't feel bad if you fell for this.I'm sure there is a special place in Hell for these People.",1
"Such a beautiful place to see the desert! Phoenix has really sprawled since I initially moved here in the late 70s. It's quite a drive to get out to the desert today but the DBG is close in, well laid out and has so many great events. I became a member in the first week I related back to Phoenix and intend to visit very often. Great for locals great for visitors.",2
"Definitely not my favorite airport. Horrible food options, no good bars. n Inefficient, long security lines nearly all the time n UGLY o free wifi Vegas has spoiled me! n rental car place is FAR and takes awhile. You have to add an hour to your travel on either side to deal with the rental car pickup return. I wish I could think of something remotely positive about this airport, but I can't !",1
"This was a very dissapointing experience, we went there expecting to get a good breakfast and instead found another of those places that like to make you wait. We could see three open tables and no crowd, but were told that we had to wait 15 minutes. So.like other places.we left. If you are nice, ask us to wait pleasantly, we might wait. But not when there is no apparent reason! Wake up!",1
"Breakfast is really good with the bagel sandwiches. The spreads are really flavorful and fresh. Tends to get crowded inside, so you may have to sit outside. Not the fastest service in town, but worth the wait. Make sure and use the punch card every time to get your free bagel sandwich after 9 purchases.",2
I'm a big time crafter which means I am always at michaels considering there isn't much of choice unless I want to drive super far! Anywho customer service is a big deal to me and this place is missing it. No matter what time or day you go to this place there is never enough people working. The line is consistently long along with finding help in this store is very difficult.,1
"I've had some horrible Chinese food delivered recently. I got spring rolls nothing special but exactly what you would imagine. I was not disappointed by them. Finally, edible duck! The last few places I ordered from it went in the trash, almost immediately. The general tso's was tasty. Great shrimp fried rice.",2
"I gave this place a try two times. Both times I've been very disappointed on the quality if the food and their extremely slow service. The food made my tummy ache all day after I returned back to the office. nUnfortunately I will no longer return. Sorry la Paloma, I really wanted this to be my near neighborhood Mexican spot",1
"I think i wasted my time and money on this restaurant. I ordered beef salad,steamed mussels in wine, and tempura dish. I was dissapointed with the taste of all, because it was greasy and salty for me. I could have just made peanut butter sandwich at home. In fairness service was good. The waiter and waitresses were very friendly. Im willing to give it one more try with their other dishes.",1
Went to this place after I drove by a couple of times.totally not what I expected when I walked in.but can't judge a book by its cover!ordered the chicken sandwich and it was awesome!great grilled chicken with awesome fresh baked bread!highly recommend! Will try a dessert next time as they look yummy!,2
Still I go back no and then to see if it's better. No go. Today at the regular price of 8.49 per pound the hot food bar featured baked chicken and the rest was vegetables beans rice etc. Whats ridiculous is the I can go to the barbecue area of the store and gets whole cooked chicken breasts for 6.99 a pound. I don't see the logic iot offering appetizing meat choices besides chicken.,1
Tried this place out cause my brother said it was pretty good. The services horrible I ordered one of their specialty drinks and it was too sweet so I asked if I could just change it to coke and they said they couldn't do that because we drank out of it already. The oxtail fries were just okay. I probably won't come back again.,1
"Our family made a bad decision to grab dinner here and it will not happen again! Out of four of us, no one finished their meal they were barely edible. The chicken and vegetables tasted frozen thawed old and the egg rolls were. well, just plain gross. I usually prefer to write positive reviews, but I just can't for this place.",1
What kind of manager lets a sandwich shop run out of bread with 2 hours left to be open. So.I decide to still get a salad for my gf.but there out of carrots and bacon bits. Can this shop actually complete a single order requested. First and last time I visit this shop. Looks like it's back to Subway!,1
Has to be my favorite sushi restaurant in the valley. They are so nice and always greet me and say good bye when I leave. The fact that it's actually run by Japanese is great too! Being Japanese I am really picky about he sushi that I eat so this place meets my high standards. Everyone should try this place if you are in the area.,2
"I don't know why they are rated so highly. The dumplings were not bad, but the chicken was the saltiest thing ever and it was pretty expensive 16 for a meager meal . For a food truck that they were saying was the best in the state, I was rather disappointed. I won't be heading back to this truck if I am in town.",1
"I went here with a couple of friends a while ago and honestly everything was mediocre at best. For the price, quality, and quantity there's a similar restaurant nearby that's way better. The service wasn't bad, and the presentation was typical. Just nothing special. I have no specific complaints, but nothing to brag about or remember, either.",1
"This place is absolutely amazing. I travelled to Pittsburgh for 4 months for work, eating out twice a day for the entire time. This is absolutely my favorite restaurant of all that I tried during that time. Suggestion The meat is really amazing, so I would suggest that you separate it from the bread in the sandwich. The bread is great by itself as well.",2
"For what they're going for, and what they actually provide, they need to work harder. It's good. but should be better. Big black hair in the food. very uncaring service. food was on the lukewarm side. Sure, what I had was tasty berry crepe with lemon creme , but everyone else had a very meh to bad meal.",1
"D bag city. Luckily we got in free with some VIP passes they were handing out at the entrance to TI. This place is small, plays crappy music and was full of douchey people decked out from head to toe in Ed Hardy gear. We stayed here long enough to watch the pirate show from the outdoor patio and then bolted. I didn't even buy a drink here because I didn't want to give them any money at all.",1
"AWFUL! Worst dining experience I've ever had! I took my sister here for her sweet sixteen and we were greeted with COMPLETELY RUDE staff, including the manager, as well as food poorly prepared and not enough seating. I have never been so dissatisfied! They have lost our business forever! Do NOT recommend.",1
The Sweet and Sour Chicken is hit and miss. One week the chicken will be good the next week dry and tough like it had been sitting out for hours or leftovers from the day before. There have been a few times when I ended up getting a stomach ache from eating here. When its good it's tasty but when it's bad it's terrible.,1
"My wife and I went to this Sticky Fingers for lunch today. We've been to this location quite a number of times and were so surprised at how salty the ribs were today. The service was good and they volunteered to replace the ribs for me, but I declined as I had no more appetite. I'll go back, but for the first time I'm disappointed.",1
The wait staff seemed stuffy! The waiter could not even crack a smile! Customer service was almost non existent only having 2 parties including us! nThey didn't have fresh spring rolls.a real negative in my eyes! My party and I were really looking fwd to them! They charged me 8.00 for 3 glasses of water! nI Yelped another spot for Pho.and left! nWe were so happy that we didn't eat here!,1
Fun cantina in Scottsdale. Good fun vibe close to Axis Radius and within stumbling distance of The W. The service is attentive and friendly. The food looks yummy but I was too busy drinking. They have tables that have their own beer taps. Would love to get a group and try that out. The Beergarita Coronita in a jumbo margarita is a must try.,2
"Ziemlich cool gemachter Diner, der mit viel liebe Zum Detail gemacht worden ist. nDie Burger sind klasse und schmecken frisch. Zu jedem Burger gibt es entweder Pommes oder Wedges. Sch u00f6n f u00e4nde ich es, wenn man auch CurlyFries w u00e4hlen k u00f6nnte, aber man kann ja nicht alles haben. nWer einen Diner sucht und sich mal wie in den 50ern f u00fchlen m u00f6chte, dann ab dorthin.",2
"This place is a dump.plain and simple and makes my list of places to avoid. AC unit was barely operating, the deadbolt lock on my door was broken and it took two days to have someone fix it and it still was not working properly, roaches all over the place. Staff must be hired from a Boces program. Never again, would rather sleep in my car than in this hellhole.",1
Called from out of state because I found them on Yelp. Wanted to send a local family a nice Easter package of baked goodies. Woman who answered the phone was completely unhelpful and condescending. I just don't understand at all what the deal was. I'm not sure why they wouldn't want me to spend money in their shop.,1
"I have been coming to this place for years and getting great service. However, the last year the service has been just awful. The quality of the work is sloppy, messy and unfinished. They are very slow and the employees are not friendly. I was hoping the service would improve but it has not. This will definitely be my last time here.",1
"Skip this place. Spoiled fish in sushi ruined my appetite before my first bite , room temperature crab tasted funny wife didn't eat afterwards , cold food in the hot trays, and hard chicken that had been under the lights too long. Six of us went and none of us ate a third bite. Pepsi was good though.",1
"Decent Thai place for lunch in downtown Phoenix. Yellow curry chicken was very good, and a friend, who eats there regularly, had good things to say about the Pad Thai. Not the best Thai I've ever had, but decent nonetheless. My ""Medium "" wasn't really that spicy, and my friend said the ""spicy "" wasn't all that spicy either.",2
I love all things breakfast and all things sweet so I am severely biased. Things you have to try! n Almond croissant n Ham cheese croissant n forest crepe Things you can skip. n Chocolate croissant very very little chocolate n the coffee very meh Overall delicious and I visited this place 4 times over 3 days ,2
"My wife recently came across a little bit of gold that was hiding in our drawer. I searched Yelp for a gold buyers and stumbled across this family jeweler. They tested the gold, weighed the gold and came up with a more than reasonable figure. It's literally a Mom and Pop place with the Daughter and Son I believe , were helping me out. Quick and painless. Just like I like it.",2
I would eat here everyday if I could! A great place to share some small plates with friends and they also have a decent beer selection. Fried pickles are on point! Perfect atmosphere and always great service. I would recommend this place to anyone. I always take family and friends here when they're in town.,2
"Ooh, great Pho! From the Bay Area so our standard of Pho is high. It didn't disappoint. Food was delicious, especially the chicken with seasoned rice and the verimicelli plates, but best of all, the service was excellent! Everyone was so nice and on top of things. Plus the place was probably the cleanest Pho place I've ever been to. Will definitely go here again!",2
"I recently purchased a Samsung Blu Ray player from this shop after seeing an ad on Craigslist. There was a minor indiscrepancy over the price as the ticket read one price and the ad said another. Obviously, they gave us the price advertised. The guys behind the counter were very friendly and we received 15 off after I added them as friend on Facebook. Note it is ""Pawn First "" on Facebook.",2
"I've eaten at various teppanyaki retaruants before, and this one was probably my favorite in the States! We had a pre fixe menu so didn't have to worry about what to order, but every single thing we were served was so yummy! We had the waiter select sake for us within a certain price range, and it was delicious! This was a restaurant within a restaurant barMasa , and they share the same sake list.",2
"I have eaten at a multitude of hole in the wall taquerias in CA and AZ. I prefer them to chains as a rule. I have NEVER had anyone tell me the tacos i ordered are the same thing as the flautas i was served. Tacos are open faced. Flautas are rolled. I didnt want flautas, i wanted tacos. Wont be back!",1
"Worst customer service I even have them a 2nd then 3rd chance. Calling in the order was a nightmare, girl talking to 3 people at 1 time phone rang forever. Could not even read the order back, and on top of that when I got there to pick up the food it was wrong. I love there food! To bad that was my last time there ever!",1
"I have had two root canals here, one a scheduled revision and one in an emergency. I must say the staff are incredibly understanding and helpful during this painful process. The doctors have great bedside manners and do amazing work. They helped save my tooth that was mangled by a dentist previously. I would recommend them to anyone and if I need another root canal I'll be back.",2
Came here after work one night 5 in the morning for their 3.99 1 2 pounder burger. The burger here is made to order and you can customize any ways you want it. The staff here was nice and the burger was delicious. This place is good for people like me who work late and people who get hungry after partying all night.,2
"It was like stepping into beauty school, my nail tech wasn't out of school more than two weeks and the hair stylist took three attempts to come close to the color I wanted on my hair. Save your time and your money, if I wanted a beauty school Experience I would have gone there. This experience was so bad I actually got a yelp account just so I could warn others.",1
"This place is simply awesome. Bruce and his staff are always helpful and can get you just about anything. They offer equipment, lessons, custom work, you name it and they will do a great job. They have something for just about every instrument and they also have rentals. I will support this local shop untill I cao longer afford my hobbies! If you are looking for guitar EXPERTS this is your place!",2
"Walking in the place looks pretty sweet! The food is amazing and the employees are friendly. I highly recommend this place to eat! For a person that doesn't really prefer Dr. Pepper this place has amazing Dr. Pepper. I plan on coming back! Ohhhh yeah and they have a drive thru for those lazy ""a.f "" mofos. .",2
"I love this store! Big, clean, and the clerks are great! I found everything I needed and then some! Open early open late! Iam so glad they opened a store in East Liberty n The music department has a good selection and great CDs on SALE! n The food selection have most name brands and the produce is very fresh",2
"Finding good Korean food in the Phoenix area not easy, and this place is more than decent. I love the tofu soup and the kimchi pork pancake, although both could be spicier. The dolsot bibimbap is also good and the kalbi well seasoned. Good selection of panchan each time I've come in. I miss tabletop grilling, and the food is a little pricey for what you get, but definitely worth it!",2
First beer we asked for they were out of. We ordered the nachos and sent them back which is very unlike our personalities. The nachos were mediocre at best. There is such incredible food selections in uptown Charlotte we didn't want to stay. Service was good and if you want to catch a game on tv this is a good spot.,1
"I tried the chipotle chicken sandwich and my wife had a BLT. Neither sandwich was anything special. For as much mayo as they laid on the chicken sandwich, you would think it would be somewhat rich. Not so. Nor was it particularly savory. For a sandwich featuring chipotle, it was all around under seasoned. Judging by some of the other reviews, the quality must be hit or miss.",1
"My first time here, I tried the kalua pig eggs benedict and it was pretty good but next time I think I'll get the hollandaise sauce on the side since the muffins were drenched. The second time I came here, I tried the red velvet pancakes with portuguese sausage. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced but I wish this place was open all day to serve breakfast, hence the 4 stars. I'm a fan!",2
"You have to check out Pin Ups salon. I get my hair done by Kristen and have been going to her for years. She is very knowledgeable in her trade and will give you exactly what you want. This is an upscale salon and spa. They offer microdermabrasion, facials and waxing as well. The environment is comfortable and welcoming. Go check it out and you'll keep going back. This is a great Salon!",2
stacy dont stop what you are doing! this 2nd location is as good as the first one! hands down best bbq in town.staff is friendly as ever.and dont listen to the snobsdale types who say your service is slow.folks good bbq takes time.go to any bbq joint in KC or the South and you are waiting a bit.so keep up the good work!,2
"Deliciously fun experience! Live and energetic feel! My boyfriend took me here on a date. we started with their specialty gin and tonic. followed by a selection of tapas chosen by our server as a sampler menu. I loved everything we had! Great mix of flavors and textures, such a fun experience and element of surprise letting the server make recommendations and choices for us.",2
"It was a fun place to stay, I really enjoyed the roller coaster! Our room was the spa suite. It was ok, however, for the price we paid it could have been more. We looked out over a lighting area and we had no view since they put us behind a false building wall. . It was ok, but I was disappointed and wished we had a view. Aldo, the water in our room smelled metallic as well.",1
This location is part of a gas station and has not been updated in years. The food is alright but there are always flies flying around in the dinning room which is pretty unappetizing to say the least. You would think someone there would have noticed by now as I have seen the flies on several occasions.,1
"Don't go in expecting decent service if manager owner is not there. I usually call in an order everyday, today I go in with my 4yr and wait 5 minutes before getting menu. Wait another 5 to sit and watch the waitresses debate about whose table it is. Needless to say I took my daughter and went to another restaurant. 2nd horrible experience so they will no longer have me or my co workers patronage.",1
" 7.77 steak n shrimp? I didn't know about that. I had the all you can eat Prime Rib for 9.99. Not bad for what it is, comes with mashed potatoes, veggies and a salad w spring mix. It'll work in a pinch, after winning some scrilla on the craps table. wanted something decent to eat but the main steakhouse is under construction. Maybe I'll be the 1st to review it. I saw the nachos.HUGE! Peace out.",2
Its just a jack in the box in the ghetto. I get the jumbo Jack with cheese and I like the egg rolls. Last time through the drive thru I asked for ketchup. I get back to work and their are three packets in the bag . WTF? I need way more than that. Then they ruined the fries by adding way too much salt.,1
"My gf wanted Asian instead of BBQ, so I found this place with really good reviews. I was surprised how tiny it was inside, and it would be really cramped when it's full. Food was great, I had the pork dumplings and a couple orders of chicken satay. I forget what she had, except that she said it was pretty spicy. We both really enjoyed it though, and will definitely be back.",2
Yelp family you've done me right yet again. I had friends in from Texas and wanted to find a Mexican restaurant that was authentic! The restaurant is tucked on a corner of the strip mall and decor is cheesy. Painted scenes of the beach. The service and food are 5 star. amazing and delicious. Well done!,2
Ended up here because several other places were closed for holidays to reopen Sept 2. Disappointing meal to say the least. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. The Xin Jiang chicken wasn't nearly as good as the one at Waterloo Star and the portion was smaller. There are better alternatives in the plaza.,1
"I read the earlier review about how terrible the food is, and I have to say they got it right. If they do only one thing, you think they could get it right. The fries were from the freezer and the steak smothered in sauce. The salad was miserable and the profiteroles were with ice cream, not whipped cream, which I think is miserable. There is good food to be had in Montreal, but not here.",1
"Most modern airports have a pretty decent selection of restaurants. Most modern airports look absolutely identical as well, as their selection consists entirely of the exact same chains. At least here you can get a halfway decent bagel either with cream cheese or as a breakfast sandwich , along with a drink, and it's not too bad, as this chain isn't found everywhere you look.",1
I've always had good experiences at Kobe. All of the food is good and comparable to other sushi places that offer all you can eat sushi. There's a really great happy hour menu and a lot of specials. The Wet Dream roll and Screaming Orgasm are really good! I also enjoyed the salmoigiri. The servers are knowledgeable and attentive. Nice neighborhood sushi place.,2
"We waited about 50 minutes for our food of a sweet beef bowl and 2 veg rolls. Too pricey for the portions. Our waitress was either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or on a lot of speed. Not really part of the review, just. man if I could put a warm blanket around her and tell her everything will be okay, I would have.",1
I try to get to Vegas at least once a year. For three years straight I make it a point to visit the Luxor Steakhouse my last night in town. The food here is to die for. My steaks are always perfectly cooked and seasoned well. The cuts of beef are exceptional and always very tender. The side dishes are also also very tasty.,2
"SEVERAL years ago, this was the place to grab dim sum. But much better have popped up and the crowds moved on, and this fell to the wayside. You can tell easily by the lack of Asian customers. On a whim, tried it again. Meh. Egg tarts were the best part, but there is so much better dim sum not much farther away.",1
I got my nails filled here and they look horrible. the lady that did them was in a rush for her next appointment that was made while I was in the middle of getting mine done. two nails got messed up and she was really irritated with that. she fixed them in a super quick hurry and did a crappy job. my nails look awful and I will not be back.,1
Our server Brooke was awesome and she did the best job she could. The kitchen was super slow and the drinks were mediocre. The place is trendy and the atmosphere was great but the drinks felt like there was no liquor in it and the food was okay. I was sadly disappointed and probably won't return because there are just too many places to go downtown.,1
"Went in today to look for party favors and supplies for a baby shower. Absolutely was not impressed. Everything is filthy and it's all just junk. It's dimly lit and hard to find anything. There was not a worker in sight. When I finally did see someone one, no ""hi "" or any type of acknowledgment. Save yourself the time and go elsewhere!",1
"On our drive from Chicago to Palm Springs we decided to alter our route to Fountain Hills, AZ to eat at Sapori D'Italia saw it on Restaurant Impossible . What a wonderful detour! The food was excellent. Service prompt and friendly and enjoyed talking with Maria about the RI experience. Wish I lived closer. This restaurant would be one of my favorites!",2
"I got the country beni basically a cross between eggs benedict and biscuits and gravy. What a great idea! I thought the poached eggs were done just perfect, the sausage had a nice spice to it, and the gravy was just right not too salty. the only complaint I have is that the biscuit was a bit chewy, it could have been more crumbly.maybe just over mixed. I would totally go here again!",2
"This mall is pretty empty. It is basically designer stores, but if you're going to drop big ONES might as well go to Caesar's Palace! There are way more designer stores to distract you and keep you splurging on and on! This place is pretty to go and look in though! Their Louis Vuitton store seems pretty big too.",1
I love Chipotle. It was one of my favorite chain establishments. I could eat here every day for the rest of my life. The people who work at this Chipotle are very nice. They are very generous with the cheese which is one of the best parts about my burrito bowl. 5 stars. It breaks my heart that people would give Chipotle anything less.,2
"They have burnt down. Shortly after a new breakfast place opened up across the street from them, surprise surprise, there was a fire in the kitchen and the place is a smoking wreck. Ran into the original owner and he was heartbroken as he had sold the place to these hipsters as they said they would maintain the ""good name and tradition "" of the place.",1
Crappy flavorless chili cheese dog for an obnoxious amount of money! 13 dollars for a hotdog! Even if it's the size of a hot dog and a half that still doesn't work out in my book. The fries were bland and only temperate. I am not surprised that they didn't have a line when McDonald's and their fast service had one! That was another thing it took 15 minutes to cook 3 dogs?,1
They Rape you on your trade ins. I traded band of brothers on blue ray. It retails for 79.00 at Best Buy they gave me 7.00. They do have some good selections but you may as well just trade with a pawn shop because you couldn't get any less. And they raise the prices on all new releases better off going to Target or Best Buy!,1
"Do not shop here! Very rude staff, yelled at me to pass in other aisle. she must of been too lazy to stand up for 1.4 seconds. does not matter if items are only 1, staff has no respect for its customers. Avoid at all costs as majority of items are NOT 1! Other stores such as Target have Party supplies on sale for 1 and much much better quality!",1
"Very enjoyable Thai restaurant. Making it my choice in town and I've tried dozens of Thai restaurants including Lotus of Siam. The cook just seems to have the knack of flavoring each dish such that it stands out. Good quality beef used, which is not usually the case. nHope they survive as it seems few have discovered this place.",2
THIS PLACE WAS A MAJOR LET DOWN! Over priced flavorless Dim Sum and I've had some shitty Dim Sum in my life The portions were very pricey and minuscule. I could tell the server knew I didn't like my food and then she proceeded to avoid my table out of fear I guess. Either way don't go here unless you don't mind wasting time and taste buds.,1
"Terrible Internet service. Terrible customer service. The automated phone service will have you transferred back and forth between different departments until you want to rip your hair out, or hang up on you. In stores isn't much better terrible customer service with flat out combative and confrontational staff if you have a complaint or problem. Find service elsewhere!",1
WOW! That was some good authentic Mexican food. The staff was friendly and the food delicious. The serving sizes are filling and I LOVE to eat! Although I was full I wanted more. You guys got me hooked. So glad a friend recommended eating there. This place is located inside the boulevard mall food court. DONT PASS THIS PLACE UP! I am salivating like crazy just writing this ,2
"Loved this place. Went here for the first time, was very welcoming. Staff was very friendly and helpful. It's nice being able to order your food electronically from the table. Hubby ordered bbq chicken wrap, I had the sesame chicken wrap with a B 12 juice. The food was awesome. I have nothing to complain about. Will be going back!",2
"So we are from Europe and have lived in Mexico, Miami and Los Angeles. Call me crazy but isn't there ANYWHERE in Phoenix to dance. God forbid you go to Sky Lounge on a Saturday night. OMG. Downstairs is 18 and under and upstairs was pounding and I mean pounding bass with hard super hard rap and for att least 8 songs we waited for one danceable song.nada. Waaaah. So we left.",1
Elaine's Nails is an amazing salon! Everything is new and clean and state of the art. All the nail technicians do an excellent job! I am very particular with my nails so I will always come here because I know I can expect only the best. I get gels and there are a ton of colors available including temperature changing colors! Everyone is so friendly and they make you feel right at home.,2
"I was visiting Vegas from LA and found elan on yelp. Great prices, clean and good work. The owner is the one who did my Mani and she even went out of her way to give me her honest opinion. She painted my nails and then suggested perhaps it wasn't my color.she was right. I was able to pick another polish.",2
My favorite Chinese delivery. You get a ton of food and it's not to expensive! The employees are always friendly and smiling. Just a little hole in the wall place. My favorite part is they will sub tofu on any entree! They always quote delivery at 30 40 min and ALWAYS show up wayyyy earlier. My husband and I eat here at least once a month.,2
"Wow been going there for years but went there recently and was really disappointed, food was horrible, the urinal rock wall was overflowing and leaking all over my shoes and to top it off I sat in a bar stool for 30 minutes before some big shot drug dealer they like there arrived and told me I was in his seat, when I refused to move the bouncers asked me to move. Casey's FAIL",1
"I wouldn't categorize this as a ""steakhouse. The food is what I'd expect from an isolated highway truck stop. There seems to be a real lack of effort in the kitchen. Fries were soggy and steak was tough and also over cooked. They do have a salad bar. I did not try it. Might be a good place to go if you just want to eat from the salad bar.",1
"Descent food, nothing special. I didn't like the fact they use part of their dining area toward the restroom as storage. Everything was alright but the fact that the waiter didn't come back and check on me if I needed anything else. As it turned out, I did. Some hot sauce, didn't feel like getting up from eating so I ate without.",1
Very unique twists on wraps and cold and hot sandwitches if your looking to mix things up. I had the Mediterranean chicken salad wrap and it hit the spot. Plus the sandwiches are reasonable priced around 6 7 dollars which is cheap next to other food joints that are way over priced for little amounts of food. dp,2
"Had to give this 1 star. First off, their website says they open at 11 a.m. on Sunday. I went there on a Sunday only to find out the sign says they open at noon. nMe and a few other people meandered around and no one was there by 1 p.m. I know the dude marches to the beat of his own drummer but you can't show up an hour late and expect people to come back. nFix the web site too!",1
"Call the butcher shop this morning to see if they any thick 2 inch steaks. They didn't but after checking with the boss, the guy said he could cut me one. When I husband went to pick up they cut to 2 1 4 inches just to make sure. It was absolute perfection. Perfectly marbled and was so tender it was like cutting butter. Thanks so much guys at Blind Pig!",2
Do not waste your money. Worst chimachanga ever. Carne asada very good the tortillas were a disaster. Soggy. Chips and salsa nothing special. Chips n old and stale. Burrito wrapped in cardboard. Taco salad dressing not good either. Besides it was expensive. Across the street is the red white and brew which I highly recommend.,1
"Handsome and I had finished a disappointing dinner at Firefly and decided to walk across the street to Del Frisco's steakhouse for dessert. Yummy! We ordered a single malt scotch, glass of wine and the vanilla ice cream with the caramel sauce and toasted pralines. that was yummy.Handsome devoured the bowl.along with his scotch. We'll be back here again.",2
"the ""grilled "" vegetables were limp and steam cooked. the vegetarian fajitas had bits of shredded chicken in them. the rice was this weird rice a roni take off on ""spanish "" rice. yuck. maybe the meat dishes are decent, but the vegetarian dishes were at best mediocre. i can cook better stuff at home.",1
Stay Here everytime I make a trip to Vegas! Love the restaurants on the property and not to mention the great rooms! Never had a complaint. If you're complaining about the rooms looking low end maybe thats because you're in Vegas and you need to spend a bit more and maybe upgrade a few floors because the new upgraded rooms are amazing!,2
"I was skeptical before coming here today but I was extremely presently surprised! My party ordered a few items and shared the hummus appetizer, greek pizza, bison burger with jicama fries, a veggie wrap and apple pie smoothie. We were very happy and satisfied! The service was fast, attentive, the quality was great and the food was cooked just as specified. I'll be coming back soon!",2
"Great course with amazing views. The Mesquite grill, what a spectacular view, beautiful patio with a wonderful fireplace. Service was great could not have been treated any better, great wine selection and with 1 2 bottles on Saturday nights makes it even better. The menu selection has great verity, I really enjoyed the Sun Devil Salad and the Fish tacos are wonderful.",2
We had a wonderful experience at Envy! The place is inviting and romantic and there is also a private dining room. We had the french onion soup and ceasar salad followed by a medium steak and cream corn. The food was excellent and our server Krisztian was very friendly and helpful giving great recommendations to us. Thank you! We will be back!,2
"This location is pretty much an accurate reflection of most of the MdDonalds in South Charlotte. The associates are rude, the management is indifferent, the orders are wrong 80 of the time, and above all no one cares. If you want the wrong order, old old coffee, and drive through people who are more interested in texting and talking to the guy in the back go to this location.",1
"For one single reason.attention was awesome! We were a group of more than 10 and they made a great job taking our orders and helping us to pay. Food tasted really good, every body left with a happy face and some, we had to ask a box as portions were a bit more than expected. I had a lamb kabob and it was really delicious!",2
This place doesn't come close to living up to the Crowne Plaza name. The rooms are clean enough however they have really cheapped out on the fixtures. The dresser in the first room we were in had broken out bottoms in the dresser drawers and a running toilet. The second room had two of the dresser drawers screwed shut because they were missing. I will pass next time I am in town.,1
"Saw the new cart while walking by the corner on E. Main and MLK on Capitol Square. My wife had tried it at UW and liked it and I'd read good things too, so I jumped in line. I ordered the F Bomb how could I not? and scampered back to the office. OMG. I came really close to going back and getting another one. It was that good.",2
"Worst service of my life. Sat at my table for 10 minutes without being approached once or even given water. The hostess also seemed like she didn't want to be there. We walked out and the 5 employees were standing by the door when one said thank you. The worst part was that there were only 2 other tables seated, who already had their food.",1
"Quite possibly the worst airport food in my life. Ordered the steak southwest salad, they brought me chuckie, when I got the steak it tasted just like the chuckie had. It was a weird pressed meat kind of texture. Three other people in my patch also had to send things back. Bid bad ass glass of wine was the salvation. Service was chipper but hopeless.",1
"I've liked burrito express because they've always had cheap food and delivered. They increased the min delivery from 10 to 15 and also recently increased the prices on their menu. They have also removed many items from the menu and they will still make them for you at a more expensive price. Burrito express was my hangover spot for breakfast, but I probably won't be coming here anymore.",1
"All I can say is that my hubby a.k.a. the man who eats to live not lives to eat RAVED about how good their enchilada sauce was. I think we have found our new favorite go to mex place. AND, last night was JAZZ NITE.a bit weird ambiance for a Mexican food restaurant but WAY FUN! Can't wait to go back.",2
"We come here often. The place is sporatically busy theot. I don't get it as the food is super. The home made fettucini is wow, as it the Bolognese sauce. Garlic shrimp over pasta, yum. Chicken dishes are good as well. I have sampled most of them and the chicken is moist and well prepared. My cousin had a veal dish last night and loved it as well veal parm . This place needs more customers! Try it!",2
"Went on the recommendation of a friend, and the positive Yelp reviews. Food is terrible, service sub par. Menu items sound special on the menu, though everything is worse than bad cafe fare. They don't even provide spoons to stir your coffee wooden sticks . Will not return. If you want a FANTASTIC breakfast, go to Egg Works on Flamingo THAT place is awesome.",1
Called few days in advance and asked if non guests could use the pool. Sure the lady said for 20 a person. No problem and even told her what day we would be there and that we would be there before noon. Got there and was told it's 175 for non guests to use the pool.OMG! After being there and seeing the state of the place and how gross and crowded it was so happy I didn't bother with their pool.,1
This is a local Favortie. The menu is amazing and the service is great. I always stare at all the treats while I wait for a table. Be prepared to wait! It's just that good. So many people come here to enjoy the food. There's everything you can dream of! Bring your while family or just come hung over to eat and feel human again.,2
"Been here twice in two years. Not a big fan. It's ironic, but both times I was walking over there, people were leaving who were complaining about how awful the place is. I certainly didn't think it was awful, but nothing really jumped out and got my attention either. It's just kind of ""there "". Give me a reason to come back, Hooters!",1
"The eye doctor seems to rush through his exams and isn't very thorough. Ordered contacts and when I picked them up they were the wrong prescription. I almost walked out door with wrong prescription. Watched as the two front clerks played the blame game. ""I didn't put that order in "". They did give me a spare set but still have to make another trip back to doctor in hopes my order will be right.",1
"If I had to have a layover, this was a nice place for it. Perhaps true to stereotypes of the south, the employees were all very friendly and kind in a way that seemed genuine. The concourses were clean, large and open, and they have ROCKING CHAIRS along the sides to relax in. ! SFO, you should hang your head in shame.",2
"I ordered a steak burrito. Turned out that there was hardly a scoop of steak left. Kid behind the counter asked if that would be good enough. No. So they had to make more steak, because of course they didn't think anyone else at 6 o'clock would order steak, and saw no need to make more upon running low. Also, the rice wasn't cooked all the way. 2 stars only because they were friendly.",1
"I have sampled a few of their varities before and they are amazing. I love that they are from Charlotte, the wildflower is a great all purpose honey and is what my husband uses to put in his coffee. I have only ever been to the location in Atherton Market which is small but still has everything you need!",2
"Low end of Okay. I had crispy honey duck, which is normally one of my favorites, but they took crispy a step to far and made it an overdone, closer to jerky honey duck. The shrimp fried rice was good, and the flavors were all there, just very underwhelming.you are better off going to Archies. On a good note, nobody got sick, so that was a nice bonus",1
"My Super Nachos were really good, minus the cheap liquid cheese. I ordered two regular burritos which turned out to be filled with air, not meat and other good stuff. They were meagerly constructed and filled leaving me to really not want to go back there again. They're even stingy on their hot sauce.at least robertos gives you an abundance of hot sauce!",1
"I've never used a service like this before it's genius. I have scoliosis so I can't do any heavy lifting at all. We needed furniture, appliances, electrical stuff, mattresses taken away asap they did it same day within a couple hours only took 20 mins. I couldn't believe how fast professional they were. I would definitely recommend to all my friends fam use again!",2
"I have stayed at many hotels and have to say this is the best so far. Everything has been recently remodeled. The casino is great! Staff is superior, they made me feel special. I would recommend hotel to everyone. To top it off I won a few hundred dollars playing there. I am definitely staying here again on my next visit to vegas.",2
"Dr Lillie is TERRIBLE! She does not listen and she does not explain things. She acts like you are stupid. DO NOT come to this practice. They do not treat patients like people. The front staff people are rude. The wait time is not so long, but what is the purpose of short wait time if the front staff are mean to you and the doctor is mean too.",1
"I joined Pinnacle for their group fitness classes and they're great. I have never used the other equipment or pool area though since I have both at my apartment facility nearby so I can't speak to that. But the group instructors are wonderful, and not many other places offer awesome classes like BodyCombat!",2
"What a great treat to get a facial here. The zero gravity chair is an amazing way to force your body to go to relaxation mode. The products they use smell heavenly. The massage and scents sends you to a different, tranquil world. After a facial here, people at work keep asking me if I got new makeup. No, I just got a facial at Facelogic.",2
"My go to spot for birthday party gifts for my 5 year old's friends. They have an amazing selection of gifts, the store is laid out into different sections girls, boys, outdoor games, puzzles, etc. so it is very easy to navigate. The best part? They gift wrap for FREE, and of course I love that they are a local store!",2
The service was terrible they were slow and didn't really come by to ask how we were doing and it took a while to get a seat even though the workers were watching us stand there in the front. They did this to about every customer that came in. The food wasn't cooked how we ordered and it just lacked flavor for french toast. Definitely not going back there any time soon.,1
"We just had the pretzels and a brew. However, we tried to sit outside on the patio and a chain smoker came out there. They really should ban these people to an island in the South Pacific. I didn't get the sense that the pizza was anything to write home about. I would go again for pretzels and sit inside.",1
"I purchased a groupon for a dozen cupcakes. I was sorely disappointed when I went in and saw the selection available. They told me I would need to put in an order for ""chocolate "". As I was planning on bringing these cupcakes to a special event, I left and purchased full price at the Cupcakery. The quality does not compare! I could make the same at home.",1
"This is another great place for good breakfast. It's good food, service is fast and efficient, and the prices are great. If you are out late or get up early, this place is open 24 7 and has great service at any time. The menu is round the clock and if you want a good piece of chocolate cake they got fresh made.",2
"Small. Very small so if your looking to watch a game, may I suggest the Sports Book or Agasies? Piss poor Bloody Mary for 10 a double shot. No fresh cracked pepper or horseradish. It's all mix. So why come? Your partner wants a coffe or tea at The Coffee Bean and your already rolling in style. Grab a beer for the road to keep you going. But go.",1
This place should have been knocked down to make room for a real resort. It's half ass in almost every way. The casino stinks like perfume and cigarettes mixed together and none of the 3 restaurants are open after 9pm. The one restraint that is open only serves cold food after 10pm and that is just ridiculous in Vegas. It's not a real resort and can't compete with its neighbors.,1
"This is a great pizza place. My wife has been to their East Valley location and knows the owners very well. We have been to their new location out in Verado a few times, and its been very good each time we have gone. Its currently being run by their daughter, who we are getting to know as well. Its nice that this place serves a traditional more authentic european pizza, and its family run.",2
"I have mixed feelings about this bar. It's crowded. It's commercial and corny. The sexual innuendo is sophomoric. But so what? It's fun! Join the other drunken crazies and sing along. Tip the singers, and they'll play a song of your choosing. Tip them even more, and they might let you take the spotlight and sing.",2
"Yul Restaurant is ideal for the invisible dinner as you'll seldom be noticed. You may spend a great deal if time updating your FB page or Yelp. Imagine a delicious looking Ravioli. Theotice the outside edges of the noddles are dis colored and hard. Cold nYou'd think an offer of fresh ground pepper, or graded cheese would be offered. Nope.",1
"Ordered breakfast to go since we were out of time our last day in Vegas. Got this scrambled egg thing with hash beef, potatoes, and a bagel with cream cheese. We didn't get any of the ambience so I can't say much for that. For was okay, but we definitely need to come back for lunch or dinner. Service was superb.",2
"This place is great. When I was student teaching at Tempe High School, all the teachers and I would meet here on Fridays and sometimes Thursdays for happy hour. The beer is great, the specials are great and the service was regularly pretty solid. Plus parking isn't too bad either. Highly recommended.",2
"This is definitely a hidden treasure! I just ate here the other day for the first time and it was absolutely delicious! The staff sometimes seems a little out of sorts because they forgot some of our orders a couple times, but the food is suuuuuper good and absolutely yummy! The sushi chefs are all super friendly and greet you when you walk in. I will definitely be returning!",2
Excellent! The only reason I took away one star is because it's a little out of my budget as a college student my parents paid so I can't come here too often. I recommend going for lunch if one wants to keep the meal a little cheaper. We ordered a bunch of meals and shared them family style so I got to sample a few of their tasty dishes. Everything was delicious.,2
"The burgers are soft almost as if they were steamed. The onion straws have cayenne or too much pepper in the batter. The music is ridiculously loud who wants to be blasted on a Sunday morning? And the service is inconsistent attention, but then the waitperson disappears. Charlotte doesn't have a lot of choices, but next time I'll go back to the barbecue place or the sushi bar.",1
A clean store in Westgate Mall. They have a little of everything you'd need for crafting and have lots of art supplies. I usually frequent the yarn section and the gift section. They always have 25 off coupons out in mailers and the everything is always displayed very neatly. The employees are nice and the store runs a lot of deals and specials every month.,2
It's just flat out tough to beat their happy hour specials. Draft Beer and Zipparitas are well priced and their wings are pretty tasty. I'd give them a 5 but they aren't quite as great when happy hour is over and although I love their Monaco Focaccia I'm not the biggest fan of their fries rings. I started going with a side salad instead.,2
"Came here for breakfast the day before leaving Vegas. Decent selection of breakfast food items. Everything was pretty standard and average, but nothing really blew my mind. Let's just say I didn't want seconds of anything. The dessert selection was sooooo disappointing. The dessert ranged from cupcakes to.uhhh more cupcakes.",1
"Consistent with every other location for service, food, and price. This location is the closest to me, which is great because there is almost never a line at this store.unlike the UNLV, Dean Martin, and Summerlin Locations, which have cars and lines wrapped around the block during prime meal periods.",2
"I was reduced to this when I was sick because I couldn't go out. I knew better than to order pho from a casino but I thought it couldn't be that bad, and I was right. It wasn't bad, plainish broth, too thick noodles. But there are no scenarios under which I would recommend this overpriced, mediocre pho, unless you're trapped at Treasure Island and sick.",1
My favorite is your Gorgonzola bread my husband loves the monterrey pepper jack with spicy tomato oil. I used DukesBread parsley oil to marinate chicken breasts and cooked them on the grill.they were fantastic! I've also used it as a sauce over salmon. You have consistently great products many thanks! We will see you every Sat!,2
"After reading all these reviews we decided to give this place a try. We went there during a weekday for dinner. Be aware that they have a long waiting line. We had to wait for an hour. We had the steak special which comes with a veggie side, potato, a salad, bread and a beer. It was good but not worth the wait.",2
"Used to love this place, until the manager ruined it. TERRIBLE food, EVEN WORSE service, and a manager that acts like you insulted her personally and TAKES it personally if you complain. After you've waited 20minutes for the mayo that they forgot on your sandwich. AFTER YOUVE ASKED 3 times lol. Just don't TELL them you've had bad service.",1
Rooms clean. Food in the hotel is lousy. Eat anywhere else. Staff seems to have no idea what they are doing. Took 30 mins of disagreeing for them to find my original paperwork and see I really had paid in full in advance. Resort fees were ridiculous. Rooms are cheap so that's why the rating is a two and not a one.,1
"Chompies is awful, my New Year's resolution is to never step foot in a chompies again. The food is always mediocre at best. The service is always super slow no matter how busy it is. I swear that they put some sort of laxative in the eggs because I caever get home quick enough. If you like crappy deli food go to Chompies , if you like halfway decent deli go to Scott's.",1
"This Ace Hardware is very close to my house, so i have gone here quite often. They have great sales all the time and i get a coupon every now and then as well. They carry an amazing amount of products. Which is very handy. Any time i need a key cut i come here. They are very helpful, fast and efficient. Plus a good price for the keys. Lots of parking, good selection and close by!",2
"We have used this company for the past 5 years or so and used them again yesterday. Had to stop and say that they are absolutely fantastic! They show up on time, their employees are clean and friendly and their rates just can't be beat. I'm sure you will be as happy as we are so thanks to Sue and all the other staff members at Carefree Clarity.",2
"I always come here for cheap chinese food whenever I pay Vegas a visit. It's a good meal to have right before the long drive back to LA! 4 star for the quality of food that match up with it's price. Customer Service isn't so bad, the waitresses that work there are all really nice. They never disappoint when I visit. I'd come back again! This place is my go to chinese restaurant!",2
First meal coming to Vegas and I was craving a smoothie and decided to stop by here To grab a quick meal. Realizing that was one of the biggest regrets of my trip. Ordered a smoothie and Jamaican bowl. The Jamaican bowl was disgusting. Bland chicken with sauce that didn't taste like anything thing like Jamaican food. The smoothie tasted like a slurpee from 7 11 only 3x the price.,1
"This buffet is hands down the best in Vegas right now. It gets 5 because of the location Cosmopolitan and for the food. Be sure to be there at 5pm when they open because the wait can get long. My favs are the fried chicken wings which come in these mini French fry baskets, safron shrimp rice and the desserts. They have everything from hot lava cakes to French macaroons.",2
"Joyride was a joyride. Finally made it in after being on my radar for a few weeks. Quite possibly the best tacos I've ever had carne asada, baja fish, and short rib . Not sure if the 2 star reviewers are on crack, but these tacos were muy delicioso and service was definitely top notch. I can't wait to be able to sit outside in their lawn area with some tacos and brewskies without melting away.",2
"I Love this Place! Alway running into friends when on my breaks or lunches here is nice. And My Lovely Baristas have My Grande Quad Shot Americano with Caramel Drizzle down packed! People always ask me why I selected a Brand name when it came to my morning JOE. Well, just like the bars I frequent, I like regular s Have an Amazing Day!",2
"It was a good experience dining here.Nice hip atmosphere and friendly service. nGreat selection of dishes from seafood,beef,poultry,pasta etc. The desserts are to die for . nplace is huge. you can get lost going back and forth from your table to the buffet area. nprice for two was 50 tax tip. Price is for weekday brunch.",2
Trendy scene with great food in old Montreal. Around some nice bars. Tasting menu is good and worth pairing with the wines though five glasses may be too much for some people. A biting the pricier side for Montreal. Fois gras is quite well done. nService is friendly as is the case for now the rest of the city.,2
"Blue Adobe Grille had great reviews and I was looking forward to some classic New Mexican food. I saw a lot of good reviews on their seafood, so we all gave it a shot. I think maybe they had a bad cook that day, but all the seafood was way overcooked. Even the pork tacos were so overcooked, my friend gave the order back to the restaurant. We went on a Friday nights, so its quite surprising.",1
"We ordered the chicken Masala Dosa. The chicken filling was fragrant and spicy. A melange of complex spices cooked with pieces of chicken was highlighted by peppery coriander. My table mates were too busy wiping their brow of sweat cause by this dish and taking straight shots of yogurt to put out the fire I for one didn't feel a thing, and contemplated wiping my face with the dosa.",2
"The pizza is bit pricey but excellent, and the garlic knots are super. Staff are pretty good. Service is a little slow but that is probably because it's a new place and really busy plus all new staff . I hope the place continues to provide great food because it's wonderful to have a good restaurant in the area.",2
"Huge portions continue here after new ownership took over but I liked the flavor and quality of the food better before. The food is nothing memorable. nThe meat was a little dry and very fatty. n shrug I used to recommend the place with the old ownership, but I can't say the same anymore. If you're dying for BBQ and happen to be in the area, it's okay. But it's not a place to drive cross town for.",1
"Horrible customer service! The garbage that they hire to work there are too busy hiding from customers too help anyone or are incredibly rude to you when you get up to the register! 0 eye contact, impersonal, rushing you or give you attitude when you dare ask them a question! Also, clothing and garbage are everywhere on the floor, it is a mini Walmart inside the mall.",1
"Zzzzzzz! Boring, Crappy DJ was there even a DJ or just shitty music spinning small! Awful bottle service! I kinda hate everything about it! Even getting free comp'd bottle service it was awful! We left and actually went to our work bar! Maybe I'm spoiled by XS and Hakkasun I don't know but it was awful!",1
"i quite like this place. it's like eating at a hole in the wall except you're at the venetian, and the prices show it. however, i like it the atmosphere, the staff, the food. it's run like a small family restaurant. this is my favorite place to go when i'm in the area. that's not very often, though, so i have no recommendations, though.",2
"Not for the easily offended. Definitely puts the sin back in SIn CIty. If you want impressive physical feats that Cirque is known for and also some bonus laughs and plenty of females nekked! , this show is for you. It would be tough to find a bad seat in the theater, so don't worry. Just relax and enjoy the ZUMANITY!",2
"Love this place. No seriously, LOVE! California club breakfast sandwich the best thing I've put in my mouth first thing in the morning in a long time. The house style frittata is unbelievably amazing as well. Package it all in a cute, small, quaint, local establishment with a drive thru as well and it's a score.",2
"I really wish I could give more stars! nPerfect 20 year anniversary celebration thanks to the Marriot! nThey have excellent client service coordinators with serve with a genuine smile, the rooms are extraordinary, and our meal at Roys was to DIE for! nThank you Marriot, for making our 20 year celebration so memorable.",2
Food as always is good. The Service on the other hand is very unaccomdating. The girl at the register let us know when we asked if there was a manager available that they were all on vacation. So I am guessing that customer service is the last thing this place realy cares about. Because of the rudness.,1
"In a location as over the top as the Cosmo in Las Vegas, my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by lunch here. I wouldn't recommend as a destination for dinner, but if looking for a quick meal on the lighter side, it's one of very few options around, without being a stereotype of itself. Good food, fantastic flavors, and enthusiastic service.",2
"I don't love this place. The staff is not very knowledgeable. When I went, they were out of ramen and asked me if I wanted something completely different. I didn't think the food was very good, and I was starving at the time. I don't think I will be back very soon. There are other sushi places around that are much better. I do like that they have magic eye pictures on the walls.",1
"Horrible customer service, poorly managed. I made an appointment for 5 for a pedicure and walked out at 5 40 without painted toes. They did put my feet in a tub after I was waiting for 15 minutes, but when my toes were properly wrinkled I pulled them out and promptly left. It would of been so much better for them to tell me to come back at 6 so i wouldn't of wasted an hour of my time.",1
"I took my old iphone in yesterday to have it repaired, not only was the customer service fantastic, but they're way cheaper than their competitors. I walked in 15 minutes before close most businesses give you the cold shoulder when you do that they were so friendly and willing to help. I'll definitely be using them again. Good job guys!",2
"So convenient. I know where everything is in the store. I love trying their own products for a change. I am a big fan of the produce section. I like the lettuce bags, the mini squash, the organic bananas, the organic strawberries and the onion pack. I am very excited they are getting seasonal produce in like acorn squash and sweet potatos. Oh and my favorite part of F E is the hybrid parking spot!",2
Watching this seasons Hell's Kitchen and realizing that Ramsey made a mistake on the head chef who ever it is. The place is pricy and the food is not good at all. I have been to quite a few pubs and this does not serve real pub food. The only reason it gets 2 stars instead of one is the beer was good but still pricy even at Vegas prices.,1
"It's a local joint with your traditional American fare bar food. I love the staff here, shout out to Brady and Alex! It's a relaxed ambience with the bar in the center and seating around it. Masculine decor with dark wood accents throughout. It's the perfect place to go to after a long day of work and a quick drink before going home. Their happy hour starts at midnight, half off!",2
"HORRIBLE WORKERS. I went in to create my own sandwich and the guy there said I couldn't choose my own sauces so he put them on for me, he burnt my sandwich, charged me extra for stuff I didn't order and forgot to give my change back. Not once did he apologize for any of these things and he also had a horrible attitude. Not cool.",1
"I'm pretty appalled on all fronts for this location. Not only was the store unkempt, two separate employees one a manager were unable to help me find a product after 20 minutes of searching. While I wasn't in a rush, I was frustrated when I ended up finding it myself after their hunt. Avoid this one and hit up any of the ones downtown if at all possible.",1
"Initially I was excited.a coffee shop in Gilbert that serves Cartel! Not so fast. The decaf espresso is a substandard mass produced bag you might pick up at Walmart Supercenter. The barista.and I use that term loosely, couldn't understand why I might be a little upset that I was getting a 32 cent cup of coffee when I paid almost 3 for a cup of Cartel I didn't get.",1
"Mac's is great for BBQ, beers and buds. I headed there for lunch with some co workers and everyone really enjoyed their meals. The atmosphere is a bit alternative, which suits me just fine. If I lived in Charlotte, this would definitely be a frequent stop of mine. Side note ask for the hushpuppies. They aren't on the menu, but you can get a free batch just for asking. They're pretty tasty.",2
"I have lived here for over a year and like it a lot. The location is great, the grounds are clean and staff is friendly. The apartments are older but it helps with the noise levels from neighbors. However, our unit faces Hayden so there is a lot of noise from the street, so if you can get one that's not directly on Hayden.",2
"Tony Moreno salon is amazing! I am new to the area and was nervous about trying out a new place. My appointment was with Manny, he sat down and discussed with me my ideas and what his professional opinion was. I really appreciate the great customer service and the ability they have to make you feel comfortable. He did an incredible job on my cut and color, I'm so excited I have found my new salon!",2
I have wanted to eat here for some time and finally did so today. It was a long but fast moving line of those with sausages ordering to eat the same. If you a young lady on the prowl this is the place for you. The all beef dog was perfect! The cheese fries were yummy. All for less than seven bucks. A great lunch. I plan on going back on Monday for a brat.,2
"This place is amazing. They had a Sony 46 "" LED KDL 46EX600 for 550, and everywhere else I looked had the same TV for over 900. The store was packed with customers, some buying multiple TVs, but the staff was still super friendly and helped me find what I was looking for. 5 stars for offering the BEST deal in town.",2
"Incredibly average food, decent service. I visit the Cosmo several times a year and have dined at every restaurant in the hotel. Will not visit this restaurant again and would not recommend to friends. All restaurants in the Cosmo were really busy, and this one was empty. A red flag that I should have recognized.",1
"CHILAQUILES! CHILAQUILES! CHILAQUILES! They are like a punch in the gut that you will ask for over and over again. Also, the little sammiches at the bakery counter. With a slice of ham, a little bit of melted cheese, and a roasted pepper on a sesame bun. Worth ever literal penny you will pay for them.",2
"I have ridden this type of ride elsewhere, but having it on top of the Stratosphere made it WAY better! Being up that high and adding in the wind factor make the adrenaline pump a lot more! The ride is safe and exciting and gives a great view of Las Vegas. I've gone during the day and at night and both were awesome!",2
"This bar lounge is impressive! As soon as you get carded at the entrance, you find yourself entering elevators that shoot up dozens of floors and since the elevators are made of glass, you can see the skyline . Once at the bar, the view is equally impressive. You are situated well above all of the lights of the city and the decor vibe was excellent. I will definitely return.",2
If your looking for a biker bar then GO HERE if not and most of us are not wanting that then GO SOMEWHERE ELSE The GM treats the staff like shit and is an asshole with terrible breath plus the owner sits at the bar and drinks. I was hoping that this place would be our new watering hole but it won't happen here. Blue 32 and the Fox is where you'll find me and my boys.,1
"Went here 2 11 11. I got the petite fillet mignon it was very very good. A steakhouse should have a great steak and this place definitely did. The sides calamari, crab cakes, broccoli, mushrooms, onion rings, were just ok. The service was excellent. Hubby got bone in rib eye. Also, got 2 glasses of wine and a martini. Total bill was 175 pre tip. I think that is very reasonable dinner total.",2
"I'm not a big fan of sushi and never really wanted to try it, but after I had eaten here I'm a huge fan. The sushi was amazing and everything tasted great. The price is a little much but it is totally worth it. The atmosphere is good and the place is totally clean. Everyone is super friendly. Overall a great place to eat.",2
"I usually order a rib eye steak as it is my favorite cut. The rib eye is just so wonderful to savor. My most recent visit I decided to try their house signature steak, the dry aged New York strip. It was good but too dry. That is why I always go for rib eye cut as it is flavorful and even when it is over cooked, it does not dry out.",2
The experience was absolutely delightful. Our server Keith made us feel welcome and appreciated. This is so uncommon from most restaurants. I'm pretty sure the ladies at the table were blushing from his kindness. The food was made to perfection. I can't believe we had dessert too. If you go for dinner ask for Keith. You won't be disappointed.,2
"Dude, awesome! The food is amazing and the staff is on point. They were very friendly and easy to have a conversation with. All in all my meal was delicious, I had the Santa Fe, and my friends enjoyed their meal too. The food wasn't too expensive either. This is probably our new favorite breakfast place.",2
Nick's is a great little neighborhood spot! I do take out probably about 3 4 times a month from here! When I feel like dining in I usually go to the Pinnacle Peak location as I like to sit at the high tops in the bar I love sports and they usually always have a game playing on the tv . Pinnacle Peak location,2
Love this place! The pho is amazing very affordable and who else has love music on Monday! Discovered this place thanks to a group I paddle on the marina. First came on a Thursday and they had kareoke. Great time. Servers are awesome and so attentive! Clean. But the best part is the food! You won't be disappointed. I don't drink alcohol but the do have a full bar as well.,2
We stopped here for an emergency appointment for new glasses for my daughter while on vacation and just passing through town for only a day. They got us into the doctor next day. Within a couple hours we had seen the doctor and gotteew glasses. The staff was very helpful in picking out nice frames. If we lived in town we would not hesitate to return to this LensCrafters.,2
"Okay so my husband and I were craving nachos. We ordered the steak nanchos to split. The order was huge and tasted decent. I think they should have been since they costed 18! Anyway, the beer was way over price and do not have a huge selection on draft. One Miller Light beer was freakin 8!?!?!? WTF!?!?",1
Looking for a local coffee shop with an excellent barista. Then look no further. Don't the the exterior fool as its looked in a strip mall. Once inside and once you place your order you'll see why people go out of there way to stop here. Excellent coffee all around. Everyone is always friendly and happy to help in any way. Great place to sit with your laptop while enjoying a cup of joe.,2
I always make a point to stop by Buffalo Bill's when I am in Cave Creek. It is a bonanza of unique items and good deals. I was looking for a set of 3 decorative pots. If you cannot find them at Buffalo Bill's then you are helpless. They do not ship out of state so you'll have to hit up the UPS store on Tom Darlington Rd. to ship your wares. Friendly and helpful employees. Lots of great finds here.,2
"Very mediocre tastes one notch above a frozen Tombstone pizza. The pizza itself really only deserves 1 star, but their selection of toppings makes up for it. There are other items on the menu that may be better, but since this is ""Pizza "" Picazzo, I'd expect better. Rosati's is a much better option in the area.",1
"I have been to this location before and I hope this is my last time here, the service is OK not great but not awful. I ordered a pork taco and by the time I left, my stomach hurt very dissapointing nEdit my mother was getting limeade when the machine broke and limeade was everywhere it took awhile to get some help from employees",1
"How many different ways can you say terrible? Pizza super greasy and undercooked.chicken parm is horrible.not sure if that is even actually chicken. I would rather eat a tv dinner. Better be nice and drunk if you are going to give this place a shot. So.I tried the ""new "" location. delivery. nStill no good.sub par pizza just as I remember. nOh well.what can ya do?",1
"I just went downstairs to the front desk with my computer and asked for a 15 page document to be printed out. Morgan Esle, the receptionist asked me to email him and he printed it quickly. He didn't even charge me anything, he just gave it to me paperclipped and delightfully wished me a good evening. Great staff and friendly service!",2
"Heard about Lotus of Siam on Top Chef Masters. Every bite I had was incredible! We tried variety of items Stuffed Chicken Leg, Bacon Shrimp, Pad Thai, Braised Short Rib in Red Panage, Crab Fried Rice, Fried Bananas. My favorite was the Crab Fried Rice, it is a must have! Get there early,to avoid a Lon wait or make reservations a day or two ahead. It is a definite must visit again soon!",2
"One word nHORRIBLE! nThe food was lukewarm and not very appetizing. The only thing decent that was served was the chips and salsa.when it finally arrived at the table. nI tried to do a take out order on their Chicken Tortilla soup, but was told that they don't have carry out containers?! I wouldn't be surprised if this place closed in the near future.",1
"Love this place! nIf you go for breakfast, try the feta omelette. They make it the persian way and it is absolutely delicious. Their jams and marmelades are awesome too and come in different exotic flavours. nLunches and dinners are good too, but i prefer the breakfasts. nDeserts are also unusual and to die for! nService can be a bit slow sometimes though, so don't be in a rush when you go there.",2
"I live right around the corner from this salon and have been here once. Once was enough. I had a horrible experience here, with a technician who was visibly P.O'd and surly, even rude towards me as she did my nails. She drew blood while trimming my cuticles. I will not go back and I do not recommend this nail salon when there are so many better options in this part of Scottsdale.",1
"Other pizza places will not deliver to us. One day we say a US Pizza guy in our neighborhood and called up. Pizza was good, I loved the hot wings. The wings are very traditional classic taste, hot enough, but not too hot. I look forward to trying the Mexican food. Do not be afraid to try this place out, it won't knock your socks off but you will get some good food.",2
"I came here for lunch and got the orange chicken. They served wonton chips with the meal, which is always appreciated. The battered chicken pieces were tender, the sauce was not too overpowering, the portions were good and the price was right. What else can I say? It's good Americanized Chinese food.",2
"This place is expensive enough to afford air conditioning. So came in ordered food, ordered a drink but was told the soda machine was out but tea was still an option. Ordered a tea, ice machine is broken, all I get is a sorry, not even an offer for a refund. So now I'm sitting here drinking hot iced tea with no air conditioning waiting on my food. I WILL NOT be back here.",1
"Food is good but the service is horrible. The waitress brought the wrong order and instead of fixing the order she argued with me and said she was right and that's what I had ordered. I had guest with me and we were all amazed at the lack of class and customer service, at the end the customer is the reason why she has a job!",1
This place looks really old and run down and when you get inside you feel the same. theres tons of brands and most of which have great sales going on. be weary of the kiosks. those guys are salesmen to the umpteenth power. theres food shops here and there but the 3 times ive visited the mall ive only went for the shopping and im outty. no need to overstay such an unwelcoming experience.,1
"We went here during Sunday open bounce. We have kids of varying ages and they all had a blast. Besides the inflatable they have ride on toys that our toddler played with more than she bounced. For the price at first we questioned the time limit of open bounce, but once we were there for almost 2 hours our kids were exhausted. We will definitely go back.",2
"I followed Tiffany here from her previous office and am glad I did. The office is very comfortable and homey and the office staff inside the office are very kind and warm. Tiffany is very LGBT friendly, too. I took one star off because the scheduling department has some room for improvement in terms of scheduling and phone courtesy.",2
"Two stars is ""Meh. I've experienced better "" which is how I felt after eating at Elie's Deli. I had a greek salad with grilled chicken and it was just ok. My colleague had the falafel and she said the same thing about her meal. Bottom line, I may or may not go back. It's convenient for lunch from my work but I wouldn't go out of my way.",1
HORRIBLE! Don't be fooled by the decor this is not even close to Yogurtology. Odd options of flavors. Gross toppings. The only fresh fruit they offer is unripe strawberries. No granola that doesn't contain raisins. First time I went one of my flavors tasted spoiled and I felt extremely sick rest of the day.,1
"Did not like the Boba here. It was too mushy, my iced almond milk tea was warm even with the ice. The tofu snack was bland and the sauce was ketchup and sweet. The tofu snack was also very soft. The blueberry snow also sucked, according to my fiance. The best thing about this place was that it was cheaper than any boba place I've been to in California.",1
Pricey and just average. Had the 23 wagyu burger and really was just average. Maybe if it cost 16 would have been better but once a burger crosses the twenty mark then it should be spectacular. Also had the white onion soup and was surprised that it was sweet. Don't really recommend this place and falls in line with the other mediocre restaurants at Mandalay.,1
Just got take home from here. Best food I have in a while that I did not cook myself. Staff was pleasant and had food ready before they said they would under fifteen minutes. I will tell everyone that is looking for Chinese to go here. Next time I go out I'll be there to eat in the patio I spied when walking in.,2
"Great food. I ordered the filet mignon with a side of their macaroni and cheese. Both were excellent. GF ordered the Pad Thai. Very flavorful. Our ahi tuna appetizer was also excellent. Service was attentive and quick. Their expensive menu made it hard to choose. For a midrange price point restaurant, this is the place to go in Planet Hollywood.",2
"Smoothie King is awesome. I love the Pineapple Surf, and get it quite often. I have cut down a bit because these are LOADED with sugar. Loaded. We're talking over 100 grams in some cases. This location is fine, in a good area, and the staff is okay. There was one occasion where a friend and I both got sick after drinking our smoothies, so I knock off a star there.",2
"They got my lunch take out order wrong and I didn't realize it until I'd returned back at work. The flavors didn't sit with me but I've only tried one dish. My co workers rave about it so I'll keep an open mind, hey everybody has a bad day, right? Oh Yeah, Guy Fieri is not someone I consider reputable.",1
Awesome clean Chinese food close to home. I am there at least a couple times a month for dinner. They will cook to order and will modify dishes to your liking. I don't like too many mushrooms so this is a added plus for me when they can cook the dish without. The soups there are very good to my liking. My favorite dish there is the sizzling pepper steak.,2
"Wow, what a great restaurant. After nine dishes 8 of the 9 were 5 star! All dishes were very flavorful and plentiful for several people. The black Cherry martini was also a hit. The food came out promptly and the French waiter with red hair was pleasant. Be prepared to spend a little but well worth it.",2
Yet another vegas disappointment. I went here with my fiance and a few close friends last year for our engagement party. We each ordered the four course prix fixe menu and were very disappointed. The service was slow and the waitstaff knew nothing about the food they were serving us. I think the only person there that even has the slightest idea as to what he's doing is the sommelier.,1
"The service was way better than the food until a large party came in, then the waiter couldn't handle the 3 tables he had. The drinks, which was a Washington Apple was served in a extra large shot glass instead of a martini glass. Worst of all, it tasted like cranberry with a squirt of Crown! Last Friday's for me!",1
"Excellent food most of the time. I would come here fairly often during undergrad, once I realized LuLu's was not that great. Really, you should go here for the bubble tea which is quite tasty. I am a fan of the dumpling, pan fried noodles, and braised pork. The other reviewers are correct in saying it is not as good as it was, but it is still decent.",2
"Visited on Friday 3 25 for supper. I was really looking forward to a good Cajun meal. Out of fish on a Friday? Are you kididng? And, crab soup so salty, was not edible. The waitress, who was really good, did not charge for it after complaining. Rice and beans pretty good, and wait staff quite attentive. I really did expect better. Will not be going there again.",1
This is probably my favorite place to go to do 80 of my drinking in champaign. It's chill and out of the way but interesting people show up. The ownership knows what their doing as well as service is always quick to serve and quick to help. How awesome is it to feel a good party mood yet ALSO be able to talk to someone!?,2
"What is not to love about Costco? Oh, maybe that the bathrooms are so far away, the lines to pay are usually long they do move quickly though or that the snack bar doesn't take debit cards. Well, even with these little problems I still love shopping at Costco. The products are good, the prices are good, the samples are fun and delish and the coupons are a bargain. Love my Costco membership!",2
"Dick's Last Resort. This place is a novelty where the waitresses and waiters schtick around being rude to customers. It got pretty annoying after a while, but, I guess it is good for the tourists. Aside from the atmosphere, the food was not so good. Personally, I do not know of anyone that would go there to eat. Must be the warm and fuzzies the servers give you.",1
"This place was pretty good. It is the only place that will heat up your crab legs. I went here on a Monday night and the wait was 2 hours. It was worth it, but the buffet at the Wynn is pretty good as well. This place has many varieties of food. From authentic Chinese food to authentic Mexican food. This place did not disappoint.",2
"My doggies and I absolutely love coming to this park. I have small dogs, so I like that they have a separate fenced in area for the little guys. The big dog area is enormous and fun to watch the retrievers and such go after balls in the water, but it gets a little rowdy over there at times. It's a great social activity for pets and pet parents. Glad to have this available for us to use.",2
"Visiting from the US with mom and dined here on 23 June. We're Chinese and have very high expectations of Chinese food. The food exceeded our expectations, especially my mom's, which is rare. She complimented the owner repeatedly for having food that isn't greasy, heavy on sauces, or too salty, things we're used to seeing in American Chinese food. I strongly recommend it!",2
"We were so excited to have the guy from Tacos Atoyac open a restaurant in a location that is more convenient to us. The fish tacos and burritos are of course amazing. My husband who supposedly doesn't like fish tacos even thinks they are good. I also like anything with the chorizo, and the Pastor is very tasty. We have only gotten take out so far, but it has been fast and affordable.",2
Came here for drinks. The bar and restaurant are on the second floor. They have an outdoor patio with an awesome strip view. Their mixed drinks were quite good. One thing that is is that to exit you will have to pass through the gift shop. It's great if you are looking to get some souvenirs on your way out.Not so great if you are just going outside.,2
"I have been here for lunch a few times and with each visit the quality of the food has continued to decline. At my last visit the rice that came with the sashimi bento box was mushy and had an odd metal taste to it. The green tea was not brewed, but rather served in a leaky kettle with a bag. The service is great but the food is disappointing.",1
"Words can't begin to describe my dinner extravaganza at Europea last night. The food was delicious, the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was lively. This was easily one of the best meals of my life truly a magical birthday experience! Make dinner reservations several weeks in advance and arrive hungry.",2
"I Checked in the Manor Lodge, room was extremely bad, very old, not renovated nor maintained Long time ago. Place is smelly and bathroom wasn't good. The room rate itself was moderated but all other activities and facilities in the hotel are expensive. Food quality is not good in the buffet bur the steak house us good and expensive in t he same time.",1
In the 4 years that our three doggies have been patients of Sunridge Animal Hospital we've been very happy with the service from the 3 doctors we have seen. Having been here for both routine and emergency care I would not hesitate to recommend this vet for your pet care needs. The front staff has been hit or miss in the past but the new folks seem to be friendly and efficient.,2
"Friday afternoon and I showed up at 2 and there was a sign on the door saying ""will return at 2 "". Figured they would show up any minute so I waited. 30 minutes later of sitting in the hot AZ sun and still nobody. If you are gonna run a business you shouldn't least try and be professional. This is just absolutely ridiculous.",1
"We went to Bali for our honeymoon. The food here is as close to the food we had on BAli as I can find. It was delicious. We have eaten here many times. Sit out side and enjoy a Thai iced tea if you get the chance. nso sweet, and watching the retarded Pittsburghers walk around acting silly is fun too.",2
"This place should be avoided at all cost. Nearly every time I order through the drive through, they get my order wrong. I get off work in the am thinking I am going to get a double whopper with cheese. Nope . They took my money for it, but when I got home it was a single. Stay away from these rip off artist!",1
"Been here once with some friends late at night. Good was alright, service was alright. Our server had his girl hanging out who kept staring at us like we're about to ""steal "" her man.we were on a double date. Worst part, the cook was brushing his hair with a fork.it was disgusting. I stopped eating instantly. Will not return for any reason at all.",1
"I came here a Sunday morning for dimsum. I get the Vegas up charge but 50 bucks for two dishes of hargow, 2 dishes of shu Mai, one sticky rice, and 2 sodas is just stupid. The food was prefrozen, oversteamed and nothing special. Next time, I'll stick to Rowland heights and Alhambra when I'm craving dim sum.",1
"I wanted to like this place but I just don't. They have an entire menu that is Vegan and I love that but honestly the pizza was mediocre and WAY overpriced. You can get a better tasting and cheaper vegan pizza at Whole Foods. The roasted cauliflower was good but nothing amazing. I feel bad for the amount of money that we spent here, it could have been used for something much better.",1
"This is a typical mid range steakhouse. I got the grilled chicken salad and it was good, not overwhelming. The chili was actually really good. Our server was great, we had a party of 8 with separate checks and she did a great job getting everything correct. We were seated quickly and got our drinks shortly thereafter. Great location, close to the highway and convenient to other stores shops.",2
"Horrible. The hidden taxes and fees are ridiculous. They try to con you into buying their total insurance package. I was told I was initialing to decline all services and when I looked again after, I actually had signed for 4 day roadside assistance. What a scan. Will not be renting from them again. I will be filing with the BBB",1
I've been to this place three times and I've been happy with the service each time. They can accommodate pretty much any nail design you want and their prices are reasonable. The location is great and right in Old Town Scottsdale but it's slightly hidden so keep an eye out. I love the fact that I can make reservations online too.,2
"Not a place to get your dog groomed. After being dropped off they call me 20 mins later to tell me that my puppy cant be groomed because they cant get her out of the kennel that she is trying to bite them. Well duh, that's why I told you to muzzle her prior to putting her in. Not very smart but what can you expect from a chain store like this. Go anywhere else but here.",1
"Great store. Always clean and organized. The checkout lines move really quick too, even when it's busy. I don't come here as often as I did when I lived around the corner, but when I do, I'm glad to see that it's still being run well. I like shopping for Meats and Deli food here. Their Produce section is ok, but not great. Return Factor 40 ",2
"The best view of the strip hands down! Super classy atmosphere, lot of young sexy people walking around, beautiful lounges, my favorite is the chandelier bar.breathtaking! We had a wrap around suite and our view.wow. Fountains of bellagio, Eiffel tower of Paris and the strip.we felt like we owned Vegas haha! One of the only hotels with balconies! The view is worth the price!",2
"8 adults dined on breakfast Nov. 1st 2012. 8 adults violently vomiting with uncontrollable diarrhea that evening, and spent the 3rd in terrible shape. Cosmo Hotel says sorry not out problem. We were guests at the Cosmo. Ruined our last day at SEMA. Made our drive home a nitemare. Never again will wicked spoon be a desired Vegas option for any of us.",1
The suite at the HRH tower was really nice for the price we paid. It was a great place to party before heading out to Vanity. If you call the concierge before 9pm they'll get you on the list for Vanity and you'll get in right away so that was a great perk. We continued the party late into the night and never got a noise complaint. Good spot to have a great time.,2
"This place saves lives. IFyou find yourself in the RIO on a weekend around 6 8 pm and you are thinking of getting something to eat. Skip all the craziness of waiting in line for an hour at every last place in this casino. Grab a pretzel,some bites, a pretzel dog or some fresh squeezed lemonade and catch a cab back to the strip.",2
"Okay.I gave this place 4 stars but.way overpriced. However Las Vegas seems to be overpriced on just about everything. This was however a decent burger. Id go back.just make sure I wasn't paying haha. 18 for a burger, fries and a coke. 14 would be the most id pay for this. I give BLT burger an 82 100",2
"I had a confirmed reservation but unfortunately made it via Yelp for Wednesday and had intended for Tuesday. When we walked in on Tuesday in March at 6pm there was only 1 table that was occupied by patrons the place was empty and the hostess was very rude.she said that she wasn't sure if she could accommodate the 4 of us. Screw her, we left and went to the Herb Box.",1
"I want to give a higher rating, the food was a 4, the service was a 2, the menu on the table was a 1. We thought we were ordering happy hour margaritas but when the bill came they were full price. I guess the little menu they put on the table only had a few items that apply when you dine in. Not cool.",1
"Great value for your money, decently priced, pet friendly and clean. I only stayed one night with my friend but it was very convenient, easy to locate and we had a pleasant stay. The staff was very polite. If you get a chance try Postino's about a mile away for some great bruschetta and panini sandwiches.",2
"Maybe we tried this place on a bad day or something but we came, we saw, and we were disappointed. We split an order of the la classique poutine and it wasn't awful but it certainly didn't live up to the expectations based on all the reviews. Honestly, I've made better at home and I'm not even Canadian.",1
"Hubby and I went today. I ordered Asada plate. I thought meat was better quality than Robertos. My husband had enchilada rellano plate. I liked mine better. My plate had rice, beans, pico and guac, along with 2 fresh, piping hot flour tortillias. Condiment bar had usual fare. Food came out very quickly and order was correct. I will return.",2
"Very disappointing. Overpriced, bad service and mediocre food. This place is your classic convention center rip off. if you are stuck across the street at the hotel it would make sense to eat here. Other than that. there is no reason for a local Pittsburgher to even pay dahntahn parking when there are so many better restaurant options throughout the city.",1
"We travel full time and it was time to get my hair cut and colored. Danielle did a super job and was fun to talk to. Thanks to Brittany, the receptionist, who put me in touch with Danielle after I walked in requesting a stylist to help. The salon was clean and fun, and I would highly recommend it. Patty",2
"I haven't tried any of their entrees but keep trying the pizza and it keeps disappointing with a cardboardy crust, sugary sauce and not much cheese, especially for the price. I think I'll drive the distance for Lorrenzo's, so worth it! nWas hoping that the new owners may change things but hopefully they are still just getting underway!",1
"Boyfriend and I ate there last night. Good was decent but the service was absolutely horrible. We were ignored. We didn't receive refills on out sodas, and it wasn't even busy! The waiter passed back and forth, servicing other tables and never came to us to make sure we were alright. Never going back there again.",1
"These assholes ""replaced my number "" because they couldn't fix the left clip holding it in . Waited a week for my car only to find the clip had just been fixed and the stole my cell phone charger . No I didn't take it out I never take it out and they still had the balls to charge me for a new bumper",1
This place was amazing! I'm a vegan and they were very accommodating both times I went to vegas to make sure we found the vegan items on the menu. The second time we had a party there w a group of friends and pre ordered a vegan feast and everybody loved it and they weren't vegans. The atmosphere was very nice and the service was great. This is on my list of top places to eat when I visit vegas.,2
"Came here for a business dinner. The club scene here must be really good otherwise, I don't know why it has the reputation it has. The food was so so. It's ultra dark and loud in there. It was kind of weird to dine upstairs and see part of the place roped off and empty. I was expecting a cooler vibe.",1
"Totally confusing from the decor, to the ordering ""system "", to the menu, to the location of utensils, napkins.the flow of the place is ridiculous. Food was OK. Guess I dont appreciate stale, flavorless tortilla chips, brown old guacamole and peasant cuts of meat. I'll take Roberto's over this joint any day.",1
Crap boneless wings nuggets were f king COLD. Check your microwave guys. Overpriced.get me home fast please! For being the ONLY place to get a drink and something to eat while waiting for planes.this place is way overpriced and the service sucks. The food is microwaved or cooked nextdoor at the fastfood burger place. Avoid if you can.,1
"i should have walked out the moment i walked in. duck taped massage chairs? creepy chairs lined agains the wall with fans at the feet? we were told pedicures were 20 but they failed to mention the ridiculous 2 upcharge if you pay with a debit or credit card. it was so hot in there, too. they need to turn on the ac. it was awful. never again.",1
"I wanted to like this place, especially after reading all the rave reviews. I went there with my specifically chose it cos it was odorless. They are not equipped for men's pedicure, just an fyi. nmy nails came out nice, but it lasted a whole 2 days! My nails last longer than that when I paint them myself. nthe ladies were nice, the place's very cute, but ultimately the mani pedi i got was mediocre",1
"Best thai food in Vegas. Period. Their Pad Se Ew is to die for. The egg rolls are amazing. Its SMALL cramped and a little ghetto, but the food is seriously amazing. I highly reccomend it. My fiance and I tried many different thai restaurants in town before finding Original BBQ now this is the only place to go.",2
Yucky would be a more appropriate name.2 rolls took 20 minutes to make.and there was only one other group inside Wed night at 8.had teriyaki and salmon rolls.average at best.apparent this is a chain and quality leaves much to be desired.there's another sushi restaurant near Sunset Station on Stephaine I went to a year ago.name escapes me.that was much better.,1
"This is our go to place when a special event at work or home requires a sugar infused celebration. Red Velet, White Choc Raspberry, Choclate Choc chip and Marble are favs! In all the times I've been there I've found the staff to be friendly and helpful. even when I come in a short notice CAN I HAVE SOME BUNTINIS NOW! . They also freeze well for travelling back to Ohio.",2
"So gross, I will never come back. The staff was drunk, customers drinking left over beers from other customers left on tables, people with starring problems. Just a low class dive bar that needs a complete make over. Stay away, there are better places to eat Jack in the Box would be a better choice.",1
We ate here TWICE in the week we were in Vegas. The Sushi is HUGE and the other noodle dishes would feed two. The wife and I ordered a couple Sushi rolls and one regular entree and we were stuffed! Appetizers were a little pricey so we stayed away from those. Service was PERFECT! Red Dragon Roll and Crunchy Rolls were AMAZING! If you like Sushi and Noodle dishes this is the place to go in Vegas!,2
Overpriced and terrible service. Had to wait ages for food despite the fact that the restaurant was almost completely empty when we were seated and only half full when they then claimed a rush of orders in the kitchen. 1 1 2 hours later a mediocre and overpriced pizza arrived. Did I mention it's way overpriced and the service is shit?,1
I simply can't give a good rating to a company that stole money from me for three months. I canceled my membership in October 2010 and they continued to charge me until February. WTF. I finally sorted things out but they don't have a copy machine so be prepared to ask for and fill out two forms if you want to cancel.,1
Walked into the store and was greeted with a very short hello by two young females. I spent a couple minutes trying to find my product and was offered no help. These two girls continued to gossip at the front counter not even acknowledging that I was even there. I have always been offered assistance at every Sallys I go to. Horrible customer service!,1
"Was here for lunch. Kitchen lost our order, waited 30 minutes for food. My kids were kicking each other with restlessness by the time it arrived. Got a quick apology upon delivery of food at the table, theobody came around afterward. I regret tipping upfront. Felt really ignored. 2 thumbs down for today's service, they're normally better.",1
"Here for lunch with group of 6. Waitress brought 2 miso soups, took a bit of time and brought 2 more, and several minutes later brought the last one. Same with the entrees. Brought out 5, and most of us were half finished before final order arrived. We even asked about it. Waitress very confused and said The last item had just gone in. No apologies, no nothing. Terrible service. So so food.",1
"I gave this place 5 stars because I have never been even slightly disappointed here. Great find for the area! They have a 15 3 course tasting menu on Wednesday and Thursday, which is ever changing and delicious! For food like this you can't find a better deal.So yummy, good service, decent wine selection, I suggest you try it for sure!",2
"When I ask for water w lemon I want lemon! Tutti mari needs to be drained before added to the sauce, so it doesn't become soup. Caesar salad was soaking in dressing. Had to ask for more bread. Sorry this place would be out of business if in a real city. Didn't help that I got food poisoning symptoms 4 hours later!",1
"So very slow while she was nice and did a great job ""making "" my iced tea it took FOREVER before it was our turn to order drinks. Only 1 person taking orders and making drinks when there was a line about 8 people long is poor on the part of the owner manager of this little Starbucks inside the New York New York. The lady was friendly and gave great service though!",1
I come here only because it's closer than the Walmart and they give military discounts which means cheaper by few cents.maybe. Seems everytime I come here I have to wait a long long time just to pay for my merchandise and go. employees are always too busy on the phone or helping others researching parts and have nobody to man the register.,1
"Joy did our design for the front yard. She worked within our budget and guided two very inexperienced xeriscapers through the process. Six month later, our yard is beautiful. The trees were very healthy and grew tremendously over the summer. All the people who worked on the crew were delightful. We will be using them again for the back yard.",2
"Basically you serve yourself by putting different meats, veggies, spices, and other ingredients in a bowl and then they cook it for you on a giant grill. I took my vegan brother and his wife there since they could just mix vegetables. Decently priced and you caever make the same thing twice. The food kind of tastes like Mongolian bbq.",2
"Over a good time at the Blue Martini Lounge. The dance floor could be more spacious. The bands are usually pretty good. The out door patio, the indoors upstairs separates the bar area and the stage is behind the bar which is unique in itself. Pricey drinks but the food is pretty good and helps to balance that out.",2
"I would have to agree with the other reviewers that this place is really decent. I am not a raw fish fan, so AYCE was used up on a lot of cooked items that were all fantastic. The service was extremely friendly from our initial greeting to our exit. The location is very large with a modern appeal, and very clean. The server was a very friendly and provided great service I think her name was Jamee.",2
Went here for breakfast last weekend. My girlfriend got the pancakes and they were amazing. I got a breakfast sandwhich that was pretty good. My sandwich didn't warrant the price tag but you've obviously paying resort prices and we expected that. Great atmosphere and they also have Press coffee which was a plus.,2
"The ice cream is delicious but the place is filthy. Sinks, counters disgusting. Dust on the inside of the glass where ice cream is held. Only ordered because ice cream was covered. The door to the back room was open and that room was equally dirty. No health rating sign up, which is not good. Too bad because the ice cream was delicious. Clean this place up!",1
"I usually like O'Charlies but apparently tonight was not a good night. The salad was old and withered and pretty much not edible. The medium rare steak was hard and tough and I was unable to eat that also. But my 2 dogs at home will be thrilled with this steak! Thank God the baked potato was safe! nO'Charlies, please re evaluate yourselves!",1
"To be fair, we didn't eat there. We went in and the place reeked of that orange spray. We still tried to man through it and preceded through the cracked walls, dirty floor, and blinding flourescent lights. When we got up to the counter, the worker said, ""Everything is to go. "" it was 30 minutes til close. More concerning. the counter smelled like sewage. so we turned around and got out of there.",1
Stay away from this dump! I'm Dominican and the food here is far from authentic. The service is horrible. The issue there are the waitresses and most if the food is bland! You can go for appetizers like pastelitos and kipe. Also the morirsonando is good here. They do not sell here Dominican spaghetti.,1
"Great little place for lunch. nTasty gyros, affordable, quick service and generous portions. Would have given 5 stars if not for the fact one of the cashier girls not the owner tends to give you the stink eye if you don't tip when paying with card. n nHave no tried their Italian beef or Chicago dogs yet",2
"Everyone raves about strip clubs in Vegas, but honestly, I was bored. It's not like I'm a topless bar connoisseur, but I'm pretty sure that my reaction wasn't supposed to involve boredom. A stripper here told me that what she really wanted to do was be a teacher. I hope she got her teaching credentials!",1
"Even with a full parking lot full of people getting things taken care of, the fully staffed location was able to get my return done in less than 10 minutes. They were able to handle a return of a product not from this location originally, which can be difficult for some employees to grasp. If you need a battery for your car, quickly, then visit this Autozone for your that.",2
"Whoever runs this place is incredibly good at his or her job. I've never seen anything like it. You walk in and there's A TON of people. You give your order within 2 minutes, pay, and your food is ready 5 minutes later. And it's delicious. The only minor issue is it's pretty tough to find a place to sit.",2
"I love the tableside guacamole and would go there just to eat it even though the price is a bit much for it. I've been there a couple of times and both times my food was very good. I also like the atmosphere, it has a upscale but yet comfortable vibe. The milkshake with churros we had at the end were oh so yummy!",2
"Dr. V is great. She really listened to me both times I was in to see her. She is thorough, she explains everything, and she really takes the time to listen. The lady that schedules, though, was very curt and not very pleasant both times I have had to call, but the staff made up for it when I got there.",2
"Good selection of shoes and knowledgeable staff. That's really all you need to know. If you're looking to find a good pair of running shoes, I definitely would recommend stopping by True Runner. They will take the time to analyze your running movements feet. And if you're planning on doing some serious running, it's soooo important to have proper shoes to support and protect your foot body.",2
"The food was solid, and they have wine. Need I say more? Ok, I will. I was downtown for a conference at the Hyatt and this was the perfect lunch spot! I love spicy Thai food, and they understood my kind of spicy! They had so many choices, particularly for vegetarians like me! . Yum Yum if you're in the hood, definitely go!",2
"Beware ! This place swipes your credit debit cards multiple times and then says ""they didn't go through "".Got home checked our bank credit card statements and what do you know ? Charged 3x for ONE room. When you call and attempt to get money refunded, all you get is attitude and no help. Something VERY fishy here. Rooms are pretty mediocre, bad neighborhood. Breakfast is a zoo and not that great.",1
This place is really strange. I received a free smoothie card which brought me here. They are not smoothies though. Smoothies have fruit and delicious ingredients. These are protein shakes made with water and powder. Yuck. Everyone who works there wants to talk to you. Very awkward. I'm giving two stars only because I didn't have to pay for this dismal experience.,1
"What a horrible experience had an emergency and needed to cancel my reservation more than 48 hours in advance.got the total runaround, talked to a bunch of people I couldn't understand only to be told no cancellations except 72 hours in advance. Beware, do not book because you might have an emergency and hilton grand Elara is too big to care.",1
"I was looking forward to trying this place out since I had heard good things from friends. The BLT I had was good tasting but my biggest issue was ""where's the meat? "" The Bacon barely made enough to be two strips when pulled together. Very disappointed. A bread sandwich with lettuce, tomato and just a sprinkling of bacon. I will say the service was great, very friendly.",1
"Nice easy hikes with few people once you are on the back part. I enjoyed the views and the hills, as well as the trails. I really can't remember which 2 trails we combined for a loop of 9 to 10 miles, but it went well and after 4 hours of nice walk we had a short stop at the nice and new library building. A good choice to catch spring blooms and enjoy silence.",2
"I'm happy to say that I returned last night to Spokes and had their spinach kale enchiladas with beans and rice, and I was very pleased with the quality of the food! I'm glad that they added another vegetarian option to the menu, and it was delicious. Haven't returned to the other food items that I disliked last time, but maybe during my next visit. Thanks, Spokes!",2
"I like Osaka. The service and food is good, and I like the fact that they serve much more then sushi. The half roll option on some rolls is also a plus. The Good Stuff Kai's Special, Oh Kamisama, Chuka Salad and the Shrimp Tempura soba noodles. And gotta love me some sake samplers. Overall, a 3.5 to a 4 for food quality, consistency, and service.",2
"Island Sushi has some great sushi and island style grinds! My friends and I especially liked the furukaki poke, the garlic chicken, oxtail curry and the many unreal sushi rolls that we stuffed ourselves with. The waitresses and the entire staff were so friendly, and went out of their way make us feel at home. Highly recommended for anyone hungry for local food and excellent, fresh sushi.",2
"I never knew Caesars had a buffet until I found about the Lagos buffet and I was excited to try it and had big expectations since it was in Caesars Palace, Harrah's top tier property. The line to get in was very long unless you were a Diamond or higher Total Rewards member. The buffet wasn't what I expected and compares to the Treasure Island's Buffet, small and limited selection.",1
"This was one of the most gratifying experiences of my life. Ok well it was pretty delish! I mean the assortment of flavors in meats. I was in meat heaven! A bit pricey, however, sign up and you get a buy one get one free coup for your b day. If you are a vegan this is not the place for you. nOh and go hungry. get your money's worth. We filled up easily in 20 minutes with a array of tastes.",2
"We hosted 25 friends for my wife's birthday party at Canonita Taqueria over the Labor Day weekend. Everyone from the busboys to the waiters to Michael, the manager did everything right and made it a memorable event. The food was amazing and the margaritas were deceptively potent. Everyone went away happy and buzzed . We couldn't have been more pleased.",2
WOW the best hair cut and color.Jenny has restored my hair after having surgery my hair was very damaged and brittle.She told me the products to use and how to make it look good. I moved here four months ago and am happy I found a great stylist she knows how to make each person look beautiful. Plan on returning every time need my hair cut and color,2
The food was tasty and the people were nice but they serve everything on styrofoam and use all plastic utensils. It's not that hard for a diner to buy a damn dishwasher. I'm not the biggest tree hugger out there but eating here made me feel ick. I'd gladly pay an extra dollar to get a glass reusable plate.,1
"So this is an update to my lasts review of rose tea, so after I ate there I got really nauseous I guess because the sauce on the food I order which was the traditional beef with broccoli was reallllyyyy thick and heavy! I had to make and late night run some anti emetic so I wouldn't vomit, how ever I'd go back and give this place a second try.",1
"When I called the lady answering barely understood what I was asking for. I asked for lunch special and she sounded lost. Second, the orange chicken was soaked in the red sauce. I mean don't get me wrong I love the red sauce but it was just TOOO overpowering! Then it was just too fried up where I had a hard time chewing it down! Unfortunately, this is a first and LAST time here.",1
"OMG! This is a must stop for tourists and locals alike! Even if you're not a huge beer drinker, the atmosphere with the brewing happening onsite is really cool. It's in a former Valley National Bank building that still has the original vault safe. Super fun, the food is pretty darn good, and the beer is, of course, fabulous! Don't miss!",2
"Having lived in Chicago for 28 years I was hoping this would be something special. The food was dull, we told the waiter we wanted certain things but wanted something with some flare. We all got basically small amounts of boring food for a lot of money. I could do btter by buying fish and meat at Costco and grilling them myself.",1
"Got moussaka. Instead of bechamel, they put american cheese on top.interesting, cheap and not a tasty choice. So much lamb on the menu, it's hard to avoid. Just because it has lamb in it, doesn't mean its Mediterranean. Friend had beef platter. Beef too dry, too well done. For this price, you could get a lot better. Would not recommend",1
"Right when you open the door, you see a rustic yet modern look feel to this restaurant. It's a very inviting and comforting vibe. Great atmosphere and amazing food. I got a burger here and I can honestly say they were the first place where they cooked it exactly how I liked it. This place is phenomenal.",2
"Online order was not ready. Hell, it didn't even get started til I walked in and asked for it. I asked for sour cream on the side but it was blopped in the bowl. When the cashier asked the guy who made it if the sour cream was on the side like the order asked, he simply answered, ""uh, I guess we'll find out "". SERIOUSLY!?!? Fantastic service.",1
"The store manager is rude, lacking EVERY key feature that a manager should have. Luckily there are two other girls who sort of helpful. However, customer service rating talking for it's quality. What a shame. Everyone on their cell phones. What a joke this place is. I rather drive few miles extra next time.",1
"This is my second and last time attempting a milk shake here. They give you a spoon instead of a straw. The straws they do have are soda straws that are thin and flimsy and collapse when you drink out of them. They need thick, wide, milkshake straws. If I wanted ice cream, then I would get ice cream and eat it with a spoon. I want to drink a milk shake out of a straw, not a pipe cleaner.",1
"Despite seating available inside we were given outside seating, the same seating was still open as we finished up. One of the two heaters was not working and the working one stopped halfway through dinner. The sushi was very good. I liked the Box Sushi, and the Ika was great. Service was friendly and fairly attentive. If i could, i would give 3.5 stars rather than four.",2
"Great food, everyone loves it. But if you're buying a gift card, shouldn't the purchaser get the reward points? After all, the restaurant is getting their money instantly and a large percentage of gift cards never get used. Why would I ever want to buy another gift card there if I don't get anything out of it?",1
"Excellent value, excellent location, excellent people. The front desk attendant who checked us in was super nice and helpful. HL at the Tequila bar was extremely kind and welcoming, had great recommendations, and really provided a lot of entertainment himself. I don't know that there's a better place to stay in Vegas for the price.",2
"Gida's rocks. I placed an order from a different state, different time zone, for a friend who was in the hospital. They delivered next morning, it was just as I ordered, and it really made his day. From the picture my friend took I can tell the design is just as beautiful as it was on Gida's website. THANK YOU Gida's for being so reliable and delivering a beautiful product!",2
"I took my 5 year old daughter and my father in law there during the swine flu season. The place was empty and we got free upgrades. The show was amazing. The sets blew me a way and this was nothing like Mystere, the other Cirque de Solei show we saw. There is always room for improvement but I think the set design and the amazing choreography are worth the .",2
"Worst pho ever! Don't ever come here , if you don't wanna waste your money! They give you very little meat on your pho, specially the grilled beef. People who thinks that this is a good place to eat , haven't been to any pho restaurants around the valley. The owner is rude too! The soup taste like it's mix with water.",1
Great grub after a night out! Their chicken wings are yummy. They have oodles of TVs around the place so you can catch any sporting event on. Breakfast is SUPER GOOD and the portion sizes are large. Prices are definitely within everyone's budget. They do a great job here and the waitresses are saucy gals with great memories. Always get my order correct. Bonus!,2
"I really like this New Mexican style restaurant! The Hatch green chile and sopapillas are yummy! I have to admit that I have only had their cheese enchiladas but they are always so good and if you like whole beans opposed to refried beans, this is the place to get them. This is definitely a regular restaurant for me.",2
"Horrible. Had the burger, fries and hot dog. Couldn't even eat the hotdog, smelled like it was the epitome of food borne illness. Fries were passable, burger was as dry and tactless as the desert itself. Would not go back, even if I was starving poolside. MGM should be ashamed, especially when there's quality pub food just inside at Wolfgang pucks.",1
"This place is a joke. They opened was a joke and closed for remodeling then they opened again and still joke. No place to dance, horrible music, and expensive drinks give it couple months and they will close their doors forever. I went there ones and you will never see me there again. There are better places in town which happily will take our money and show us great time.",1
"I came here last Saturday after volunteering. My choice was the chicken Alfredo with breadsticks. Very pleasant, creamy taste. As soon as they finished preparing it, they brought it out. The downside to the place is the bus system. There is plenty of construction going around this area and I had to ask a passerby for help getting the bus. Therefore, I doubt if I will come back.",2
"This place was such a surprise! Delicious food that ended up being pretty healthy with lots of gluten free options! I had the Huevos Rancheros, which were honestly the strips of crispy corn tortillas made it little hard to eat with a fork. I can't complain too much, they were delicious! Whether or not you have dietary restrictions, this place is fantastic. Check them out!",2

"The 18 24 something staff of this once fine gym have taken it upon themselves to blare their STUPID MUSIC so loud that you can hear it through your own headphones. When you ask them to turn it down they refuse. This gym needs a new staff, new management and a POLICY REGARDING TURNING THE GYM INTO A UNFRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT!",1
"I haven't stayed here, but I can tell you I have been to this casino every single time I've been to Vegas. Out of all this casinos, this is the party casino. There is an amazing atmosphere when you're gambling as well as the club scene. There is also a Fat Tuesdays in the building to get your slushy addiction fixed. Enjoy!",2
"I went to this restaurant, the food was priced expensive, 26 48! I don't mind paying for that if the food is that great, this was not. The mashed potatoes were a ball with this dark brn stuff that had chunks who serves burned gravy?! . I live in the neighborhood and was very disappointed, not returning.",1
"This place is awesome! A real hidden gem. I love the great variety of the menu. Went for a freinds birthday dinner, the 3 pair bruschetta was so good every one of the 3 different toppings were excellent. For dinner I had the pomodoro fresco. Amazing! The wait staff was very nice and helpful. Recommend this place to anyone perfect for parties, date nights, casual meeting with friends.",2
"Adore! nThe prices are enough to make me head over heals for the place. nAdd to this unique flavors not found anywhere else on State, I'm a fan. nTypical these days is the dal roti takari. the sweet potato being my fave. nAnd while service can be slow and it's cash only, knowing that going in makes it a wee more tolerable.",2
"So I'm kinda picky about dry cleaners and wanted a good one when I first moved to Pittsburgh. Not knowing the areas, I went here. Yep, it's Homewood, and I'm white. Anyway, I keep going back and haven't had any problems. Well done, clean clothes. Also if you pre pay you get a discount, which I like.",2
"I used to work for US Airways and I flew on them often because I flew for free. If it wasn't for that, I think I would have flown any other airline. The planes to hawaii are so old and beaten up, it's embarrassing. Even most of the employees say that US Airways isn't great. If US Airways is the cheapest, I would go with them, but if you are paying 10 more for Southwest, take Southwest.",1
"Still having to put up with a tenant from Bruce Rae making noise from his rented flat, they take in students so you can imagine the racket I have to put up with I have asked this so called professional business to deal with this matter and all I got was "" I have had a word "" what a shower of imbeciles .",1
"Terrible service. I had been there a few times and they were fine but for my last scheduled visit they were very rude. I can't not recommend them enough. There are three other choices in under a 5 mile radius, go to one of them, they'll at least treat you like a human being. Its a shame too, I had actually grown to enjoy my visits there.",1
"Resort fee intends oickel and diming you with no warning. If you booked somewhere other than direct beware that, even you your room was paid for up front, that the Palms will charge you a Resort fee for every night you stay. While the room was nice I prefer to stay somewhere where integrity is more important.",1
"Great service at the bar, good looking staff, and a great salmon salad make this a good stop for business travellers in chain restaurant hell. The burgers are just ok. but what really makes this place shine is the great service, and I truly loved the salmon salad and the kilt lifter on tap. this will be my new go to place every time I'm in phx.",2
"This place is aweful. Tried it out since it was happy hour and regretted it. The food was horrible, and the service was worse. The waitresses butts hang out of their pants so theres that. But if that is what you are looking for maybe you should just go to a strip club.the food will probably be better there anyways .",1
"My wife and I have been coming here for years and Joe's has never let us down. Their steaks melt in your mouth and the cracked crab is always amazing. We always top our dinner off with their Key lime pie! Tonight I had an Ahi steak and it was a great change from my usual steak. I highly recommend, their service is always spot on!",2
"We came to this buffet after a show in the casino. The hostesses were not very friendly, but it was busy so we assumed it was because of that. The buffet and restaurant itself is very nice and clean but the food was very average. The food quality was not what I was expecting for the 70 price tag that we paid as a couple. Next time we are in Vegas we will try another place.",1
"I love the vibe in this restaurant, but the food service is terrible! U have to pay for chips and salsa, plus I ordered extra salsa they charged me for it. I asked waitress if there are any beer specials, she said the buckets of beer are either 28 or 35, I'm not sure? The food is blah. Portions are small. Lame",1
Love this place but the wait can get out of control at times when you see empty spots open here and there while you wait. The staff are very friendly but sometimes when you walk in they think they are a CLUB and card you and scare you away. Other than that great large serving of food and great staff but parking sucks but I guess that's the whole thing about going there is an experience?,2
"Very average below average food and experience. Would try some place else if you have the chance. Had the sicilian pizza and was not overly impressed it was a bit doughy no flavor and the sauce was ""institutional "" tasting. Would only recommend in a pinch. if nothing else was open. Staff was very nice!",1
"I really like this place. I was in here on Sunday afternoon, and the staff was polite and friendly. The food tastes SO much better than other chain sandwich shops. I typically get the small tuna sandy with lettuce, tomato, onion, oregano and a little olive oil. The roll at this store is always fresh, and coming from this East Coaster, that's key. Great place for a great lunch. Two thumbs up.",2
"Wow this place knocked my socks off. The food is unbelievable. Especially the sweet potato pie, the milk shakes and the ahi tuna sandwhich. I love seeing how the staff pulled together and worked as a team during busy times. You can really see the time, energy and love that is put into each plate which truly makes this a destination spot.",2
"I went here because my friend was bartending there for a while. It's really not my type of place aesthetically, but the bar was nice and not very crowded. The specialty martinis were excellent, expensive, but worth it. I would avoid the appetizers though, they were tiny portions and insanely over priced.",1
"This public transit system is a joke. The drivers are so rude and I'm from CHICAGO , the service is very erratic. I just waited 45 min for a bus and two buses with plenty of standing room wouldn't let us on. You prepay before you board so doesn't matter how long you wait, they have your money. Terrible terrible terrible.",1
"The food is acceptable. They have a pretty wide range, but narrow the menu on Pirates game days. I tried the seared ahi tuna. It was good, but nothing memorable. The location appears to be the best thing about the place. Sitting outside on a warm evening, looking at the city skyline and seeing people walk around before a Pirates game is an interested dinner experience. But don't go for the menu.",1
"Oh who doesn't love Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory! I know I do! They have the best pecan clusters, I forget that they call them, but dang they are delish! Dark chocolate, pecans, caramel all mixed together in this heavily bliss! Oh and let's not forget the chocolate, caramel apples,omg to die for! Haven't found anything in that store that I didn't like LOL",2
"store does not honor what staples website deal even after I made call and reserved merchandise online. I followed all the Staples website rules to the T.The manager ""Jim "" is a jerk, he decided not to sell me the products at the deal price even he has them in stock and there is NO item limit. No wonder staples is going down the tube. People who work for Staples should find different job",1
"Delicious. Simply delicious. I sat at the bar and the bartender Michael provided really good service. Had the Jamaican chicken and curry, the haricot vert tomato side dish and the couscous seared ahi salad. Everything was spectacular. A little heavy handed on garlic and the bar was kinda a mess but overall, I love everything about this restaurant.",2
"This is a five star facility without question, except for one thing. The showers in the locker room are almost infuriating. The showers put out so little water pressure that it takes forever. I'm all for saving water and all, especially here in the desert, but they're a little ridiculous. Other than that, I love this place and can't imagine going anywhere else.",2
"we order from here all the time. yesterday we ordered a Vegetarian and a Joeys Deluxe. 45.00 worth of pizza! i called to complain that it was terrible, no cheese, no veggies, no meat, NOT worth the money! lousy customer service, i even offered to take a pic of the awful pizza send to her, it was so bad! she said Manager would call me back! dont bother nLAST TIME JOEYS GETS MY MONEY! BEWARE",1
"I have been several times and nope it sucks. Back to Panda. The meat taste strange, I mean real strange. The Mongoliao matter how much Soy Sauce a molecule can take its still bland. At least at YC's or even Genghis Grill you have options. You will find that there are several dishes that are decent and its all chicken.I hope.",1
I had waited patiently for months in anticipation of this awesome brewery to open it's doors! It was worth every long drawn out month ! Not only is the blended Euro Sunnyslope menu of libations and the food brilliant and extreme tummy friendly you can't find a more friendlier and good humored staff! Great job Rob Candy! We'll be regulars ,2
quickly became a regular here. the salon is very clean and an overall relaxing experience . I don't mind paying a little extra at this salon because their attention to detail is great. I always get gel on my nails and it lasts a while depending on the brand of gel you pick. I always ask what ones last longest they always for me in last minute too which is nice!,2
"First visit, meh! Nothing special except the prices. 1.00 each for small regular donuts. 1.75 for small ""cronuts, 3.00, yes 3.00 each for slightly larger ones. Very expensive in my mind for a run of the mill donut. Shop is small and extremely hot inside, and this was a cool day. Dunkin Donuts is looking better all the time. Grocery store donuts better also.",1
"I WOULD GIVE YOU NEGATIVE STARS, if I could, FOOD4BROKE! My mom slipped and fell on your slippery floors yesterday and had to be rushed to the hospital for xrays. CLEAN your WET FLOORS! You're a disgrace to this well kept neighborhood. Good luck getting slapped with a personal injury suit if my mother doesn't get better. p.s. Noooobody messes with my mama!",1
"Love this place. Great food, large portion sizes, great service, and reasonable prices. All Big Fat Greeks are pretty much the same to me and I love them all. I know its not hoity toity fancy schmancy, but I don't care. I enjoy prompt service, large portions of good food, and consistency and this place delivers all 3.",2
"Dude. it's Vegas. How can this store not have air conditioning? I made it to the first floor, walked in for approximately 25 seconds and walked out as soon as I realized that it was hotter in the store than it was outside. Bummer that I missed the third floor, but I was not about to spend any more time in that sauna of a store.",1
"Been here twice and 1st time I order a la carte and it was ok tasting and quality. Second time I went, we ordered the all you can eat menu and literally, we pretty much ate rice. Really tiny pieces of fish you could barely find with all the cucumber and other fillers and the RICE, OMG, so MUCH RICE. anyways, not worth 20 a person.",1
"They were able to help me out quickly. Customer service was fine, nothing to write home about. But this office smells horrendous. It's the bathroom and the air freshener that give this office a terribly uncomfortable stink. I would like to come back because it was an overall decent experience but the funk in here is just too much. I believe I've heard this scent referred to as ""shitrus "".",2
"Service was horrible. We ordered the Tom Yum soup, crab won tons and for the main entrees the Garlic shrimp and Mussaman house specialties. Soup was almost warm, garlic shrimp was OK, and crab won tons were cold. The house special meat was so chewy, I could not even finish one bite. After we sent it back, it only took 30 minutes to tell us we it will be 5 10 more minutes.",1
"Like everything else in Scottsdale, the prices were pretty high. Unfortunately, the selection wasn't that great. There were a few local farmers selling in season vegetables and grass fed beef. There were the other usual vendors selling home made pastas, honey, hummus, bread and cheeses. That was about it. Not really anything to wake up early for.",1
"This place was awful. I don't know why we stayed. But we had to wait to be served for an hour. Also, to top it off our food was dry and the coconut shrimp over cooked. Disappointed. Never coming here again. They didn't even give us a discount or complimentary anything. nZero stars for this restaurant.",1
"This is the most overhyped place I've ever tried. I had their roasted chicken hash and it was the most bland tasting thing I've ever had in my life. In fact, it was even served to me lukewarm. To top it off, the waitress and management did NOTHING to rectify the situation when I complained. Bad food, bad customer service. Save your money for one of the many better food options out here.",1
"This place is a bit sketchy, and it's best if you speak Chinese. But they do serve congee! Which is awesome although not the best, only place I've found in town that does it so check them out if you're feeling a bit under the weather. Otherwise, try out one of the other small Chinese places on campus for a less suspicious experience.",1
"Stopped by here with my wife before we left Montreal. Jon, the owner, was extremely pleasant! He spoke very highly of his coffee, and the passion was clear in the cup of coffee he made for us. I highly recommend this place I you're a coffee aficionado! By the way, the shop is in the back of a candy store, so don't be fooled by the store front when you see tons of candy through the window.",2
"brought the 4Runner in 2 on a Saturday, had it back 5 30. I knew the roters were warped, i needed an oil change, and I had a brake light out. They called with a few options on the brakes, changed the oil and brake light, and didn't try and sell me a bunch of other add ons. Friendly service and did what needed to be done.",2
"I've never had a bad meal here. Pasta is always perfect, the pizza is wonderful and the calzones are huge and excellent. I had my rehearsal dinner here for a pizza party and it was TOP NOTCH. I'm still getting comments about how good the pizza was. The service for that large party and whenever its just the hubby and I has always been great. DO NOT miss the Tiramisu here!",2
"Overpriced treats and drinks, nonetheless, not bad if you want that SUGARy experience. A lot of their sweets make great gifts to take home, if you had that kind of money of course. 25 blingy lollipop type of money. haha OK OK I NEED they have white fudge, milk chocolate, dark chocolate clodhoppers a treat I could only get in Canada at one point. Coolness factor just went up like zingers!",2
"I popped in to have a quick lunch and quite enjoyed the atmosphere and food. The salmon was cooked perfectly a little extra pink in the middle. I am docking one star because I think my meal was a touch overpriced. 28 for 5 asparagus spears, a beer, about 7 oz salmon, and about a cup of grits. Seems like island prices to me! Was tasty though.",2
"Their food is delicious, and they have a pretty decent happy hour special too with food and drinks. We have tried a lot of what's on their menu, and the only thing that I think didn't have much to offer was the tilapia dinner. The Buffalo Chicken pizza there is one of the best I've ever had, highly recommend ordering it.",2
"Slow service with an attitude and emo in the background. Rather expensive and very snooty. Kid at the register was blatantly inattentive and had mumbled responses to questions. Waited a long time to order, longer for a coffee and even long for a Tuna Melt 40 minutes . Will not be coming here again. Would rather walk the few extra blocks to one of the other cafes nearby with better service.",1
"The atmosphere there is great, the food is pretty simple but tastey. I go there for their wine. It really is a great selection and the staff is pretty knowledgeable. I had the tuna sandwich for the first time the other day, cause I normally get the brushetta sp? and it was really good. It wasn't mayonnaise ey. I would also recommend the nine iron.",2
"My number 1 ""go to "" place. Great food, great drinks, and a great place to just hang out. The ""Cheers "" of Champaign! nNot too long after moving here I stopped in for lunch one day, and that had me hooked. Lots of friendly regulars hanging out at the bar! nAnd unlike many bars, the kitchen is open until closing, great for a late night snack or late meal.",2
"I personally like aloha kitchen. Ive been going there for years now, me being from southern Cali, this is the place we stop at before we go home, we used to also go to the sanwich spot next door but they closed down i think it was called caparellis , anyway, I suggest you order the adobo omelete, its wonderful! and get extra adobo sauce with it!",2
Horrible dinner The butter fish that they recommended was oily and slimy and cold. I sent it back and they brought ahi instead. It was barely edible. They apologized and said they would take the butter fish off the bill but they charged me the full price for the ahi. Never again. Too many great fish eateries to waste time and money on this. very disappointing. JW,1
Very fun tourist place. The staff was nice and the food was what I expected for a place next to a ball park and downtown Phoenix. THE BIG UNIT was a big hit.everytime someone order one they would ring a bell and yell BIG UNIT.it was cute and funny for the first 30 minutes then it got annoying. If you visit Phoenix it is a definite place to stop and visit for lunch and atmosphere.,2
I'm so glad to see a Yogurtland on my side of Vegas! U Swirl use to be my favorite yogurt crave until I decided to checkout Yogurtland. A huge amount of flavors to choose from with a countless amount of toppings from kiwis and mangos to oreos and graham crackers. My favorite place to visit for dessert! ,2
"I always look forward to going out to dinner with my girlfriends here. I really really really like the roasted sweet potatoe sandwhich, the vegetarian soups, the garlic lemon penne and the butternut squash ravioli. I have tried the hummos plate and it was just so so. I went for breakfast once and was impressed as well.",2
"I cannot believe I have not written a review before, because I have been coming to location for over a year. From the service to the food, Newk's delivers! I try to get there on Sundays, the best chicken tortilla soup around, and the toasted sandwiches are always fresh and good! Great place for lunch with friends and family.",2
"Just saw this Friday night. The show started about 20 minutes late, and only lasted one hour. Only four performers. The performers were pretty good, the show was just not long enough. Also paid for VIP seats, so we were in front, but there were only fours rows for the whole show! Don't pay for VIP! Go see Legends in Concert instead!",1
"Sure, the fishtank looks gross and the decor is far more shabby than chic, but nobody comes here for the ambiance. The FOOD, man, the food is incredible. There isn't a bad thing on the menu. The cheese naan is so wrong but SO RIGHT. The chicken tikka masala is on point, and the goat biryani is so tender and flavorful.",2
"If you want real authentic Mexican food, you're better off enjoying your mother's home cooking than at this restaurant. There was nothing spectacular about this place.the price range was incredibly expensive for what it is. Example n 15 for a Chimichanga n 12 for a quesadilla nReally? That is ridiculous.",1
Would not provide a small refrigerator for insulin. I've stayed at between 20 30 hotels and have never had a hotel refuse me a refrigerator for medical purposes. I called MGM resorts customer service and they told me this was a fine practice and they have no issues with them doing this. Will never be staying at an MGM hotel again. Also this hotel is shit but I'm not even going to get into that,1
Room is kinda boring and basic. It's just the usual small two queen room with a tv and a restroom. Nothing out of the normal. Other hotel rooms here in Vegas look way more grand than this. There is an open case of Ferero rocher left here and the coffee maker also wasn't cleaned out. Will not be returning.,1
My doctor recommended I join a gym however the manager Josh doesn't seem to be a good listener or manager. Customer service is very important and I refuse to give my money to any business that does not value me as a customer. Josh needs to be replaced or the company gives him a course in customer service and he understands the value.,1
"Worst service I have had there! Inattentive waiter and took forever to get our wings. We only got them after we got up and asked someone to check. When we first started going there, the service was great including iphones that sent the order from the table to the kitchen immediately. I really don't know what happened tonight since the waiter mumbled an apology.",1
"Eno Vino is what a wine bar is supposed to be good atmosphere, a wide selection of interesting wines, and fun food. While a few of the menu items are only average, most of the things I have tried are well above average. I would come back here again just to have the truffle fries, let alone a chance to take another shot at the cheese board!",2
"Had lunch here today and loved it. The whole place is cool with a huge patio. We started with chips and salsa with table side hand made guac. My wife had a fish taco and a chicken taco. She LOVED the fish. I had three tacos, carnitas, chili relleno, and carne asada. All three were great. Definitely going back.",2
"Always been a favorite but not tonight! Sophie's Salad was underwhelming.brown lettuce and the cheese cubes were hard.it was like the salad was from yesterday.just awful. I was really surprised it was actually served to us. The ahi appetizer was tasteless. The ahi entree was really good. Corn side dish good and crunchy! nAll in all, disappointing .",1
"I travel quite a bit for work, and I really like finding a place I feel is worthy of becoming my ""local "" hangout. Picasso's is it for me. Almost every Monday night, wing special.and the wings are probably my favorite, ever. I love to get the salt n pepper wings and dip them myself.keeps the crunch. Staff is awesome too!",2
"I am updating this review for only one reason. It seems that I have spent years over looking Caramba's dessert menu. They offer a choice called ""Cinnamon Crisps "" which are warm cinnamon baked chips drizzled with warm honey. The huge portion they provide is only 1.99. You need this in your mouth. Now.",2
"My husband and i went there for lunch .This place have a really great food . I order pork liempo,chicken bbq,macaroni salad and milkshake .,.the pork liempo is pretty good and also the macaroni salad ,the chicken bbq is okay . My husband like the pork liempo and the macaroni salad and also there beef bbq . And there milkshake is so delicious .",2
It was our first time eating here. The food was just tooooo salty for my taste such as the cream spinach and tacos. The Kobe beef was tough in texture. The strawberries were tart and not sweet. You could see that there were a lot of the staff in the dining room area chatting amongst themselves. Overall experience was poor. It was a waste of my money. Will not recommend.,1
"My wife and I were only in Phoenix for three days and we ended up at MacAlpine's twice. It was that good. The shakes were great, the sandwiches hot and cold were great, the potato salad was great one day, but so so the next. The music was right, the decor was right. The waitresses were prompt and friendly. The soda jerk even wears a paper hat!",2
"Hey, Jimmy! Cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags! The early bird special is cheaper because it is mostly cabbage and the tea tastes like second hand smoke. nI had the same dish previously, without the special and it was fine hence 2 stars and not 1 . I'm going to avoid this place until I get a craving to drink tobacco.",1
"Don't attempt the long ride down Rancho to go to this place. Tried three times, they are not open at dinner, not open on Sunday and when sign says OPEN in big neon letters you can make the U turn to get there and find it is CLOSED. Web site listed does not go to the location info, it talks about Chicago weather. How can you sell good fresh food when you are not open at peak business times?",1
I really did not like this restaurant. Its way too loud. I felt pressured to eat because the dishes kept coming so quickly. Last but not least it was so cold all I wanted to do was leave. So many other Japanese restaurants in montreal are better than that. We ordered the gyoza which were not very tasty. How are ribs or corn in any way Japanese? The only decent dish was eda mame.,1
"This is my favorite place to go for lunch! I work right up the street and go their often for the amazing 13. The staff knows me by name and knows what I usually get. Even if there is a line, they efficiently work through it and still maintain a professional, customer service oriented environment. I LOVE and highly recommend this Port of Subs location! Thanks for all you guys do Ryan",2
"Love it, the sushi is amazing. I have never been disappointed. The prices are amazing a lot cheaper then buying all you can eat. Two people eating 4 rolls is good enough for me. My check is never bigger then 20 and that includes 2 drinks. The spider roll is my favorite. The wait is never long, I'm usually seated right when I walk in. Over all it's amazing.",2
This particular Starbucks is having difficulty managing how busy they are. Please HQ send a specialist to help with the looooong wait times. I've been at busier Starbucks before and they do a better job. The staff here is under trained and not your typical happy Starbucks employees. Disappointed for now.,1
I like this place but tonight not so. I ordered a microbrew good and fish and chips not so good . Not sure what it was but the fish didn't taste that good. Not sure if it was bad or what. I mentioned to the server but she didn't offer to make amends. I'm sure I'll come back since I've been here before and like the food but no more fish and chips.,1
"I have been here about 4 times and it's pretty good food. I don't think so far its good enough to pay regular prices, but I am pretty picky. I have gone most of the time during happy hour and the prices are reasonable. I love the queso dip.They have a good assortment of appetizers. I like the layout of the restaurant. It's a good place for a casual meal, to watch a game and or just to hang out.",2
"Unbelievable, the sales agent Mark Kukla confirmed my old quote and said ti is okay. I called on Thursday and gave card for deposit. The shipping was supposed to be Monday but he told me on Monday morning that drivers are looking for more money and that he is ""trying "" to get my car shipped but it might be difficult. Pure lies and extortion.",1
"The food was okay, the cocktails were very good, the waitress was terrific,.but the whole experience was overpowered by flies that relentlessly buzzed about our heads and food I killed two . it overlooks the botanical gardens but the interior looks like a remodel re purpose job that missed the mark.",1
Caot pay for delivery with a Corleone's gift card so REALLY! had to go pick up got there late still had to wait 15 20 min the guy on the phone was cool but the bottom line the pizza taste like card board and the wings put it this way i got 48 wings and 2 large pizza's for 6 people they all had a slice and a wing or two after that no one would touch it bottom line Corleone's sucks!,1
"Just came from this location, not very satisfied! I ordered my steak, medium the waitress showed me a picture and I pointed to it with garlic mashed potatoes and my plate had bloody juice all over it, mixed in my fresh veggies and everything! I could go on and on, bottom line I would not go back based on this experience!",1
"I've been eating here once a month for a few years now. Recently went in and I think they changed the chef. The food was sooo salty. Way over salted. I know what it usually tastes like, so this was a bit of a surprise. The beef in my burrito tasted like ocean water.plus. I'll give them another try but they need to get a grip on this or I wont be back.",1
"Hey vegans, they've got a menu guide just for you ask for it , showing exactly what dishes are vegan and which are not. They'll also happily substitute ingredients in and out of any dish to make them vegan for you. I recommend the potato garlic dip, the hummus get the regular pitas, the greek ones have dairy in them , thousand beans, the macro platter and there are a few more good ones as well.",2
"I purchased a Groupon for this place and I have to say, it was worth the trip. It's in a small corner next to Starbuck's. The cookies are very moist, not hard and crunchy. I got the ice cream sandwich and it was soooooo good! I recommend this place if you want something local other than major chain ice cream venues.",2
"Had the ribeye, which was delicious. My friend's filet mignon was also perfect. Food and ambiance was great, and servers were quick and helpful. I was in a big group six guys for a bachelor party. The manager even sent over a free round of drinks for our celebration! If I'm back in Montreal, I will definitely make it a point to eat here again.",2
"Tipsy and craving some delicious nighttime kebab? Kebab Mahal will be there for you with a delicious doener filled with greasy meat, drippy sauces, and garlic breath the next morning. Kinda grotty and not the absolute best doener place in Edinburgh, but it will forever hold a special place in my heart and likely my arteries .",2
"Came by to check out the Prius and James was extremely patient and helpful. nI, like many of u, going to a car dealership can be quite frightening as most of the time salesperson can be very pushy but not James. nIf u are looking for a stress free buying experience, I strongly suggest talking to James.",2
"I have stayed here many times and grown to really like the atmosphere. Older hotel but the appearance and atmosphere takes you back to the old movies. Lots of gold and crystal. Rooms are older as well but clean and comfortable. Best place to stay in Midtown in my opinion. No to close to the craziness, but not too far away either.",2
"This place is fantastic! I big puffy heart the red velvet pancakes and the orange juice was delightful! I've also dined there for lunch in the last week and split the kobe burger and the turkey wrap with my assistant and both dishes were flavorful, well prepared, and really interesting. The fries are delicious and the service was amazing as well.",2
"Yikes I have visited this place 3 4 times in hope of finding a dish that I will like, but I am very disappointed. Its neither authentic nor fusioor tasty chinese thai food. The chicken in most dishes tastes like it has been inserted in after the main ingredients were cooked, sort of bland. The ambiance seemed all right, but the food is challenging.",1
"Back to 1 star. I walk in and it's a couple of minutes wait, ok fine. Two more couples come in. A complete idiot manager not the gals currently hosting comes up and seats the last couple to come in. I'm pissed. Completely insincere apology. We leave. If you are going to use an iPad to check in people use the fucking thing to check whom to seat.",1
I was surprised at how good this shown was because my expectations were not that high. The atmosphere is intimate under a tent show you are right on top of the performance. It was a rated R version of Cirque De Solei. Very funny at times and impressive talent via acrobatics etc. Great times and worth going to see.,2
"After a long shift, its great to receive some good service. A young maamed Jent was exceptionally attentive to other guests and myself, and I will surely make the trip to this location, though its not my neighborhood i out, if it guatentees this kind of service and just a positive experience. Theres nothing like having a complicated order, and recieving no complaints. Thank you jent and the team.",2
"Went here last night prior to the Paul McCartney concert. Food was good, but the noisy atmosphere was awful. Could not even talk to my wife without yelling which is what everyone else in the place was doing. Server said the noise was because of the concert and that they were crowded. It is a bad physical design with nothing but hard surfaces. Go for the food but not the ambiance.",1
"I completely agree with 1 star review below. If you are looking for Cirque du Solei show, this is not for you. There is NOTHING from what you'd expect to see from Cirque du Solei. nThe music is great, the dancing is good. nI'd say one two acts are memorable, the rest feels like ""so you think you can dance "" show.",1
This place is great for burgers steaks. A friendly atmosphere with great service. Add the salad soup bar for under 4pp. Lipton Tea nice strong. Steak was tender juicy cooked to perfection and baked potato was great too. Strange how I only see seniors here but they know a great meal great deal when they see one!,2
Dawn was the person who did my nails. I was visiting from out of town and decided to try shellic. nShe was SUPER nice and a great conversationalist. I couldn't decide on which color to choose and she was very helpful in picking one out from what I described I liked. nWill def but back if I'm ever in Scottsdale again.,2
"Consistent excellent quality food. Best chicken shawarma sandwich I've had, and I have had quite a few no other comes close to this one! Very fairly priced, generous serving. Add feta to the sandwich they give you heaps and only charge a little extra. Thinking about moving to Tempe just so I can eat here every day 0 ",2
"I like several things about Federico's 1 It's close to my house. n2 It's inexpensive. n3 They have large portions. n4 The food tastes good. n5 Service is friendly. The only thing I don't like is the iced tea. It doesn't taste very good and isn't fresh brewed. Overall, Federico's is a good option in this part of town for Mexican food.",2
I was very impressed by the service we received. Our server was attentive and made sure our drinks were always full. We enjoyed the Tejas Trio.the cheese dip was my personal favorite. The green chile barbacoa enchiladas were great. They had lots of shredded beef and a perfect amount of sauce. Next time I have to try the mac cheese!,2
"This is the sort of place that gets corrupted by good reviews. Two newspaper reviews from five years ago and they think they can get away with 13.00 bun and a lunch special involving lots of cabbage, in fact mostly cabbage. Why would you even bother eating here, when you can eat elsewhere for less for the same thing, two stars for freshness of food",1
"I've only been to the Manna Cafe once a client of mine took me there after a press check. We both had a breakfast sandwich mine was ""The Cravenous Carnivore "". Consisted of scrambled egg, sausage, pepper jack and a little basil pesto. Who knew pesto would be good on an egg sandwich! Very yummy. Atmosphere was great and the baked goods looked fantastic. I definitely want to return soon!",2
I had the same experiences as other customers. They try and make you take all the insurance with a lot of pressure. I even tried to explain to them that my american express black credit card that I am using gives me all these coverage's and more. They must work heavily on commission because they sure dont know what NO means.,1
"Vile. You steered me wrong, Yelp. El Taco Gordo is disgusting. You show up and there's a giant flat top griddle. You have to go to a different station for each meat you order. Annoying. My asada ""steak, "" in theory tasted like little gristly chicklets of shoe leather. I spent the rest of my night cradling my stomach in agony. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1
"SUCH a great little place! Nice decor, great service, AMAZING patio and view, 5 stars all the way. Haven't had their food yet, but I will be back for sure and looking forward to trying the menu sounds like they have a good variety . Wish I lived closer so I could come here all the time. Looking forward to stopping in whenever I'm in the area.",2
"I thought the staff was super nice, friendly and attentive. I really enjoyed the chips and the three salsas that come to the table when you sit down from mild to hot. I was not impressed with the food. I ordered steak fajitas and my friend a burrito. We were both not very happy with the food. I think they used steakums for the fajitas and my friend just said her burritos were ehhh.",1
"Purchased a couple of bottled waters and handed the cashier a 20. She asked if had anything smaller. And I said ""no. "" She got snippy and said it would take a little while before she could give me change.all the while shaking her head and cussing under her breath. Wow! Must have been a bad day for her, but jeez!",1
"After having a bad experience last time I decided to give them another shot due to late night delivery . I WILL NEVER GO BACK OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE, INCLUDING MY WORST ENEMY. The service is terrible, it took them over two hours to bring me the food. The driver had an extremely bad attitude. I try never to leave bad reviews but this place deserves it.",1
"Aside from a very loud dining room, it doesn't get much better then this! Its the perfect combination of great comforting food, fresh ingredients and a warm cozy atmosphere. Oh how I love this place. Try to stick with the specials if you can. both we tried, Scallops and Lamb Shank were absolutely perfect! Oh how I love me some warm nuts!",2
"This was so much better than the other buffet I reviewed a few months ago. My two star rating is a bit deceptive, though. I gave the last place I went to one star, but if I could have, I would have given it way less stars. It really was that bad. This place. solid 2 star buffet. I'd come back, but only if I was really in a buffet mood and felt like stuffing myself until I got sick.",1
"First off, this place is a dive, and I mean a DIVE. Every animal is on the wall here. Their beer selection is abysmal, even for a dive bar.really, what kind of dive bar doesn't carry PBR? I had the fish, it was nothing special, the fries tasted like frozen fries, nothing special there either. I guess for a bar, it would work, but it's definitely not for my type.",1
"This is one of the best places to shop. Every time I shop in this store everyone is so incredibly friendly, helpful, etc. They always have the item in stock that I am looking for, the employees in all departments seem eager to help, the cashiers are always quick and accurate, and sometimes an employee will unload my cart for me. Very professional, and I enjoy shopping in this store every time.",2
"referred by a co worker as the best bbq iorth las vegas. nwe drove 15 miles and when we got there it was closed. re located! naccording to the pizzeria owner next door it's been gone for 5 months. nmoved to a west side location. nguess our referral hasn't been there in awhile! ntry their other location at nsassy sally's n7785 n durango dr nlas vegas, nv 89131 n 702 458 7427",1
"Anytime I can get all you can eat sushi, I'm a happy camper! The service here was excellent and for 27 AYCE sushi the pricing isn't bad either. However, this place is getting a 4 because the sushi could have been better. Although the ambiance at Blue Fin isn't as nice as Fukuda, the freshness of the fish and the flavors of the specialty rolls were much better.",2
"Had 3 course meal for 2 which included 3 appetizers, 2 steaks with 3 sides, and 3 desserts. We asked for the lobster bisque after reading reviews on yelp and they added that in as well and WOW was that yummy! We asked for a chocolate dessert as well and they added that too. Needless to say, we could not finish everything and the service was excellent. Highly recommend.",2
"This place specializes in pasta. They have a vast selection and it's pretty much all good. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The decor is a little weird. It's a little layed out like an office building, but it works. But most important of all this is a bring your own wine restaurant. If you're looking for pasta in this neighborhood this is probably your best option.",2
"Unfortunately, I would not recommend this cleaning company. I had them clean an empty rental house for a flat 150 fee and only 1 person showed up young college age girl and she probably worked for around 3 hours total. I would grade her cleaning at a 5 out of 10 found several areas not clean after she left. Then, my credit card was charged 5 separate times for 150 within an 8 day period!",1
"The guys at Best Buy Shutters just finished installing our shutters. They look . Terrific. We had 24 windows done including 2 sliding patio doors great value, good service, and quick install considering how many we had done in less than 4 weeks! Would recommend them to my friends and will call them up when I'm ready to do my crown molding!",2
"What is there to say about the Bellagio which hasn't been said! The 'dancing' water fountains, the great variety of restaurants including the AWESOME Picasso, the lovely entry with the beautiful glass fixtures, the flowers, the pool.If only they would ban smoking in the casinos.oh well, we can always dream.this is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars",2
"Great second night of fine dining in Pittsburgh chilled corn lemon basil soup, Black bass w a spicy creme fraiche and a finisher of a PA camembert cheese plate. Always love a smart, creative menu widely displayed on an interior wall. Will definitely be back. Oh yes, and the Big Hop East End craft beer was a great pairing for this meal.",2
The only reason I tried China China is because of good yelp reviews. I had the. Sweet and sour combo and I found it to be of low quality. I am a Foodie and this was your typical fried pork covers with flavored daises. It did not taste like it was made in house but that it came out of a bag. For really good Chinese food. You may want to try China Chili.,1
"The worst! Was happy to take my 1,125.00 to do my job but when everything that he installed leaked he would not come back and fixed it. First time he told he was in the hospital, then it was a family problem then he stopped returning calls. Now he suggests that I call someone who lives closer to me. What a complete POS!",1
"I've been to this location 3 different times and ordered 2 double cheeseburgers all 3 times and it was beyond terrible. Cold patties, cheese not melted, carelessly thrown together burgers, fries taste like they have been sitting for days. McDonald's is never expected to be the caviar of food but I would at least expect some sort of quality. If there was an option for 1 2 of a star I would do it.",1
"Would have loved to have given this place 5 stars but the service wasn't great AT ALL. We had to reorder twice maybe three times and the glass of water they gave my friend was awful. Horrible taste. The other waters were fine.go figure. But the pizza was really, really good. Try the cream sauce with cheese. Lots of flavor and lots of garlic!",2
"It's hard to believe your eating fast food, seriously, the first time I came here I was impressed. The chicken is not greasy, cooked just right, and my favorite part is the JUICY TENDERNESS OOOHHH SOOOO TENDER. LOVE it. And thats not the only thing I love HELLO?! Texas Toast! and the house sauce. The menu is super simple and everything is good so you cant go wrong ",2
"Just what downtown Chandler needed! Awesome place with tasty food to boot. This trendy spot is order at the counter style. The food is fresh with a healthy twist. Some awesome options include Low carb bread for sandwiches, stevia lemonade and quinoa sides. so great options you wouldn't typically find at most ""healthy "" restaurants. I'll be back!",2
"There is nothing more satisfying than digging your choppers into a plate full of meat. This is not the place for vegans, and meat lovers should be prepared for a treat. Simple, and community seating, with a good drink menu and a basic but good choice of dinners. If you like ribs, cornbread, and pork this is worth the stop. Plus the local scene is getting better for a night on the town.",2
"Bad service for two night stay. Room needed rehab help casino tower 972 . Remote, shower, ironing board and iron did not work. Gave feedback and even left a hand writteote with iron board on bed and no action. Insult to injury was long check in wait and difficult find thae bell captain to keep bags for the day. Too many other choices to select Hard Rock again.",1
I am a gringo from Detroit but like my carne asada. I cannot speak or read Spanish but they are always more then willing to help me out. The meat is always good and the tortillas fresh. I have never seen bugs but hell I had on in my office today. It happens. The shelves are packed but I never looked around.,2
"Came for the soft serve ice cream and was not disappointed. House special was a 'twist' of coconut ice cream with fresh strawberry sorbet. Also discovered they had a 'La Dua' flavour ice cream Pandan Leaves . If you've been in a Vietnamese restaurant or store, you've probably seen Pandan rice cakes. Has a distinctive, rich coconut y flavour. Need to get this stuff by the litre.",2
"This was the worst meal we have had in a long time. Usually you can find something at a buffet that is good, there is nothing good to say about this one. Luckily we had gotten half price tickets for it which was bad enough , I could not imagine paying full price. I dare to give this a one star even but it did have a salad bar .",1
The worst Thai food. The red curry had a lot grease on top. But the red curry barely had the flavor of red curry. It cost me almost 11 for just the curry which is expensive compared to other restaurant. Not coming back again. I prefer to make the drive to Scottsdale to Lao's Thai for good Thai food.,1
After waiting for over an hour also with 2 little kids I finally get my 16.00 spicy chicken pasta and the noodles are hard. this isn't what I would expect after waiting so long. At this point I have no desire of waiting for them to bring me a new plate. They didn't even offer to take it off the bill! There are tons of places to choose in this area I'm not sure I will ever go back.,1
Sensory overload and overwhelming array of stuff that made it very difficult to find anything. A huge area filled chest high with clothes all at 1. If you can find anything. Take your shoes off and wade in. Find a gem if you can. I personally doubt it. nEverything else was overpriced which is typical for a trendy store. I'll stick to thrifting thanks. Same stuff for 1 4 the price.,1
"Freddy's is my all time favorite burger chain. I like it even better than In N Out. I love the shoestring fries. I love their burger patty and how thin they are. I think this is what McDonald's tasted like before they went big, then again, I wouldn't know since I wasn't around back then. I wish they would have a Freddy's near where I live.",2
"We go to Vegas about twice a year and have a tradition of always going to see Penn and Teller the first night that we are in town. In fact, I book my stays on whether or not Penn and Teller are performing. nThey definitely keep it fresh and even if you have seen them on tv or live, they will most like still do something that you haven't seen before. nThis show is well worth seeing in my opinion!",2
"wish I could give this place more stars but the shelves here are pretty much always empty and out of stock items take sometimes as long as three months to get back in stock, no kidding.The staff is usually apparently unaware that you have entered the store or way to cool to be friendly even my Japanese wife feels uncomfortable coming in this place.",1
"Attended a buzzcation event tonight at Morton's. The venue was great and the right size for the amount of attendees, the food was GREAT and the service was the best I have seen at an event of this size. They served endives with blue cheese, salmon pinwheels, filet sandwiches and a tomato brioche that was superb. I hope they re book here for another event either way I am sure to go back.",2
"I really like this restaurant, but I like some of the ""faux meats "" more than others. The beef didn't do it for me, but I love the taste and texture of the ""fish "". My favorite things I have tried are the fried oyster mushrooms with lemongrass sauce, and the tamarind seafood curry. There is usually some kind of groupon deal, so check that before heading over.",2
"This is a diamond in a coal mine on that intersection. Great food to eat in or take out. All freshly prepared, and very tasty, love their red chili beef sauce, and their grilled tacos. The kids love the fry bread. nThey are a great new business in our community, they donate their tips to local non profit organizations. nAlso, did I mention their service is great!",2
I think that the filtered reviews are spot on. The regulars talk shit the entire night and won't leave you alone. The sound sucks and the beer was flat. 4 Peaks should be fresh as it comes from a local brewery. The only reason I was there was to get in on the blues jam on Sunday night. Almost got into a fight with the regular. Finally left when I couldn't take any more.,1
"We just went for a couple of drinks. It was ok, nothing really tickled our fancy. They didn't have any drinks that was different is what I look for. They didn't have beer on tap.We didn't order any food. We did find out that they have live reggae on Tuesday nights! We plan on going on a Tuesday night real soon.",1
"4 stars for the grilled cheese alone. MMMMM, smoked gouda. Never had anything else, nor am I going to venture away from eating anything but the grilled cheese. Nothing really appeals to me, anyway. But I come here a lot because the grilled cheese is just that goooooooooood. Did I mention the grilled cheese?",2
"Just OK in my book. I've had better burgers in Charlotte. The sweet potato fries were very good. The regular fries were fine but the portion was pretty small. The service was efficient no complaints. Never been there in the past, so I don't have an opinion on the old management new management debate.",1
"Holy crap! This place did not give us utensils until we got our meal. Which sucked because I could not stir my coffee and therefore it was cold. We asked twice for utensils, as did other tables around us, however they were only served with our meal. There was also a 40 min wait between ordering and being served.",1
famous for their 24 hour specials. this family diner offers decent breakfasts all made from scratch. prices are reasonable. very busy on sundays there may be a wait. service is a little slow but friendly. lots of booth seating. i'd stay away from the dinner menu not so good from experience. good breakfast,1
Came back to the room after being gone since 7am room was not serviced. Called the front desk to get a very rude unhelpful person. They said their policy was to do rooms of people who checkout first. This is sunday. The hotel is basically empty. Makes a lot of sense to clean unoccupied rooms instead of rooms that have guests in them.,1
"This is not first time I have reviewed this place, so I won't cover the same things. We keep coming back because the food is authentic, delicious and cheap. The lunch specials are great deals and a great way to try something new. The only criticism I have is timing. It takes awhile to get drinks and the food comes out sporadically. It never comes out at the same time.",2
"Very nice place and a beautiful view, but that's where it ends. The people right when you first walked in were very nice and accommodating. Our server was rude and the prices were high enough to be in the Wynn. This place is nice, but not that type of nice. Also kind of an older snobby crowd. Only thing that would bring me back would be the view and the swans!",1
"I ate a sampling of their food at the Taste of Las Vegas Food Festival and was very disappointed. The flavors were lacking, meat was tough and all around seemed to be of poor quality. I'm not sure if this was just because of the venue however I would think they would want to make a great impression at the festival to drive more busiess to the regular restaurant.",1
"Stopped by here for a quick regrouping catching up. think ""pre drinks "" before the real evening started. Generous pour of my favorite vodka Hanger One Lime so they're good in my book! Plus our server was friendly and really on top of her game. considering we were constantly ordering drinks left and right! Alcoholics. for the weekend!",2
"I had heard a lot about how great the food was at Lo Lo's downtown location, so was excited to try when I saw they opened a place in Scottsdale. It is by far the best fried chicken I have ever had! The idea of waffels and chicken sounded weird to me, but after trying it Im hooked. This place is by far some of the best ""comfort "" food I have ever had. A must try. my kids love the Kool Aide ",2
"The store is HUGE and new, and attractive. It's a good store, and I like it more than the Belk's and Macy's in the mall. It's not crowded. Maybe because it's on the back of the mall, farthest away from the main entrances for cars and people , people just don't go to it. It can be your personal Dillard's.",2
"Pour la pizza. Je n'ai jamais os u00e9 commander autre chose puisque j'ai toujours u00e9t u00e9 satisfait de la pizza ici. Toujours la classique toute garnie. Le service est rapide et amical. Le soir u00e0 partir du mercredi c'est un endroit tr u00e8s occup u00e9. Apr u00e8s avoir manger, allez donc faire une petite marche en face sur le bord de l'eau. Superbe vue u00e0 proximit u00e9.",2
"This place is amazing. We took in a rescue and alas, he was sick and our other pets got sick. Dr. O was WONDERFUL with Sammy and us! and then when we brought our other older, overweight pets in, she came up with a great plan for us that was very doable. There was no ""selling "" and we felt like our babies were very cared for. We have found our vet for the duration of our pets lives! Great job guys!",2
"Just waiting for my contract to end. In an emergency you CAN NOT get your pet seen. My puppy was dying from Parvo and they would not fit him in.They told me to go to a pet ER.why am I paying for this insurance? I found a vet that is not sales driven.and cheaper than my price with ""insurance "". Horrible.I have steered multiple friends away from this mistake since I have signed up. Never again.",1
Nice people. Cute little place. But the food isn't that great. The meat was undercooked both times I tried beef and chicken. The only two good things are the veggie rolls and the vegetable soup. The vegetable soup is really tasty and has a lot of flavor in it. I don't recommend it unless it was for either of those.,1
"Got a Irish coffee over the weekend with a friend. Nice decor and very laid atmosphere. Was not impressed with having to wait at the counter while she said ""one moment "", ummm shouldn't you drop whatever you are doing and help your customers? I wouldn't have ordered anything if I had noticed the ""Grade C "" inspection rating earlier.",1
"Decent, basic, but fairly boring menu. There are much better options in Anthem. The water tasted funny. which made me question the cleanliness of their ice machine. We told our server about out check in discount yay yelp! , but she neglected to take it off the bill. It seemed silly to wait around for the 90 u00a2, so we just left without it. Keep looking explore the better options around!",1
"Solid old school Barbershop. I've been to several barbershops on this side of town trying to find a good one. I think I've finally found my new barber. Solid ambience, skilled and friendly barbers who aren't afraid to strike up a conversation with you! , and a convenient location. Tip I went in the morning before 10am , and the hustle and bustle of Kierland hadn't started yet.",2
"Second time I go to those guys. Great service, friendly and always looking for a solution to your problem. This time my battery had died. I didn't even have a receipt but they still trade it without any cost. Both Nick and the manager John were super friendly and helped me out right away. Great guys! I wouldn't go anywhere else as I definitively trust them!",2
"Pretty hilarious that you have to watch your language in a bar for 21 and up only but whatever. This bar isn't in the best location, Boulder Highway has lots of transients and this location is no exception. The food, bartenders, and atmosphere is barely average. Wouldn't suggest it to friends, family, or anyone else",1
"Honestly, this isn't the best chicken and waffles I have had. I would rather go to Waffle House Popeyes but then I would have to make two stops and who wants that. Roscoe's has them beat hands down but since there isn't a Roscoe's here LoLo's will do. There is a breakfast spot at the corner of 48th st Indian School who offers better chicken and waffles if you have a craving.",1
"This place is just no bueno at all! No complimentary breakfast, no pool, wifi is 10 free with rewards membership , pay for parking even as a guest. Waited over an hour for an ""engineer "" to bring me a pair of pliers to get my debit card out of their ATM. Save your money and go to a cheaper hotel that is more accommodating!",1
"Terrible queues. Service is minimal. The associates treat account holders like nuisances instead of paying customers. Surprisingly, the manager was the rudest person there. Asking how many people were ahead of us seems to warrant an irritated attitude. A number of employees walking around instead of assisting customers. Avoid this branch.",1
" 4 for an 8 ounce cup of coffee? I think not. I can go to coffee bean and get a bigger size for the same price. Their food was pricey too, so no thank you. The vanilla latte I ordered did not taste like it had any vanilla in it. I give them another star for the decor and artsy feel of it, and the cute guys that were working in there when I came in, but that's it. Disappointed.",1
We came out here for the Native American Heritage festival and we were pleasantly suprised to find small ponds and a shooting range plus friendly geese and ducks all over. The park was very nice and well shaded with lots of kids fishing and feeding bread crumbs to the wild birds. A great place for a relaxing afternoon without having to leave the city.,2
"I really liked it and the server was lovely. I got the torta though and I would try something different next time. Everything in the sandwich had a soft texture and it needed something to sink your teeth into. Husband had the sausage and peppers, it was good. Would like to go back and try some other dishes.",2
"We stayed at this hotel last July 19 for 3 days. We called the front desk if we get billed if we use the wifi and the lady said ""NO "". To my surprise, when we checked out they billed me for the use of wifi for 2 days. The signal sucks that u could not even get good connection. I complained but my complains fell on deaf ears. I'm not going to check in to this hotel AGAIN!",1
It was our first time at this bar in vegas we live in san francisco been to a bunch of gay bars but never had a slow bar service it took us 20 something minutes just to get our first drink. We didn't get there 25 unlimited wells drink. but any how the music and the ambiemce was nice. My advice is come over here if you are not planning to drink.,1
The quality of the food here really dropped after their remodel. A lot of the food tasted like it's been left there for hours and the selection was mediocre compared to what it was before. They no longer had a wide variety of seafoods or asian cuisine as they did in the past and attempting to eat any the meats was like trying to chew on rubber. I would not recommend this to anyone.,1
"I came here for brunch and ordered the southern heritage. The gravy was meh, the biscuits were dry and my bacon was over cooked. I know it is a small plate place, but I would have liked a larger portion for brunch. Other than that the service was okay and the atmosphere was pretty cool. They had a DJ for brunch. What.",1
I had a great first experience here. The staff were very friendly and offered me tea and good conversation while I waited for my take out. This is a family business and it feels like it. The food was great. We especially liked the spring rolls and Pho. I'm looking forward to going back soon and I'll add more to the review when I do.,2
"I love its all desserts! If I had 2 stomachs, I would eat all of them! Seafood paella and Italian food area were my second choice. I feel like oysters were not fresh for me. I had much better oysters before, so they were kind of disappointment. Overall, good price and a large variety of delightful food.",2
Was just here yesterday and there was a car hop girl in her late teens I think whose customer service skills were on point for a sonic. Just friendly and knew exactly how to keep a conversation. Forgot her name but you don't run across many car hops like her so she shouldn't be that hard to pin point! Great job!,2
"The jerk chicken is delicious. The dinner portion with rice and beans is more like 3 dinners I have eaten it for two meals and still have a tupperware full. I have had it several times. This last time it was brought back to me in Chicago, still warm after 2.5 hours. I will be stopping in here at homecoming to have it again!",2
"So I had Breakfast here, and sometimes in Vegas, besides the buffets, a great breakfast is a hard thing to come by. This Breakfast was spectacular. My boyfriend and I both had the Donuts with Chocolate sauce, naughty and delicious! And then we had the Corned Beef Hash, homemade and delicious! I would suggest this place to anyone, ideal location on the strip!",2
"Hayashi is a GREAT place for good sushi sashimi and drinks! We've never done the hibachi side, but we love to sit in the bar and order sushi. All their rolls are superb, with fabulous presentation. Also, if you're a fan of the Vegas Roll, be sure to ask for it! It's not on the menu, but they'll still make it, and it's WONDERFUL!",2
One of the best if not the best middle eastern restaurant in Charlotte. I haven't tasted all their dishes yet but all the ones I had have been scrumptious. Their desserts are fantastic too. nThe atmosphere is made even more genuine with the enchanting music of 60 70's Lebanon. nGreat outdoor patio area for a good weather day. nServers are friendly and hard working. nPrices are fair.,2
This place is within walking distance from my house so I go there often. The bar staff is very nice and freindly. they have good drink specials every night of the week and it is a good place to watch a game. nThe food is better than typical bar food and has a wide selection. I like the cheese sticks and the Burgers.,2
"Great food, great atmosphere! I always enjoy coming here with the fiance. The ONLY complaint I have is that the hostess is very unprofessional and inexperienced to work for a restaurant of this caliber. Rather than seat us, or anyone for that matter, she simply points and says, ""you can just sit over there "". Not the level of service this place deserves. Other than that I LOVE this restaurant.",2
"This joke of a place that likes to call itself a ""local bar "" is a piece of S sat at a table for a good ten minutes with not even a head turn from the staff. Then we'd decided the bar for better luck with no avail as well, we as locals love hanging out at a place where we live close by and would be regular customers.this place just lost a handful of new returning customers.",1
"Called yesterday for an appointment and got one for today. Very convenient. Took the dogs, they were super friendly and the dogs looked awesome when we picked them up. They felt so clean and super soft, and had even little scarfs on. They always have specials going on, so you have to call to get their prices. Will definitely go back.",2
"Am i the only one for whom P.F. Chang's was ruined by one or more episodes of 'South Park'? Actually, i'd never eaten at one until a recent trip to Vegas. But all i could think of as i ate some chicken that attempted to make up for its lack of taste with absurdly unnecessary spiciness was what my couric output would be. Disappointing in every regard.",1
Every time my family and I visit Vegas we somehow always end up here. Two things that are constantly good Ox Tail Soup only available at dinner and sushi really! . I also enjoy the fact that each diner gets to choose a steak or lamb chop made to order. They are not out of this world steak and lamb chop but a buffet restaurant offering that is pretty awesome!,2
"This place is definitely a hideaway! We came here to grab a drink before pre dinner drinks before dinner and drinks.maybe it was a little too early b c we were about the only people in here, oh well! What I recommend.Jumbo Lump Crab Lettuce Cups and a glass of Pinot Noir! Heard their pizza is pretty good as well.",2
"Finally finding a great nail place close to home! I've gotten my acrylics done by Tiffany and Vicky. Both did an amazing job and stayed on without chipping I'm really harsh on my nails! also got a gel pedi before Christmas by a guy, I'm unsure of his name, but it was great also and still in tact! They have reasonable prices for a salon and have plenty of staff. Amazing place to try out!",2
"This is the club to go to after all those other clubs are closed. Usually, when I'm with my girls, we love to stay out until the sun rise. Most clubs are closed by 3 or you want a change venues, I would definitely pick this place. The music is great here. I highly recommend this place if you want to keep partying until morning.",2
"Sur La Table is expensive but also has every specialty cooking item you could ever want. They've got cooking appliances, a wide range of cookbooks, flatware, and so on. For example, I found a whet stone there for knife sharpening. If you're into cooking, it's a fun shop to browse, and the staff there is pretty helpful.",2
The bartender expects a tip on even the smallest of tabs. We came back here after a bar hop and got heckled for it when we were opening a large tab with food and drinks and about to tip generously. It was so bad that we decided to leave and never come back. There are other places that understand customer service better. We had this experience a few times there!,1
"This place is totally awesome! A perfect addition to Bloomfield. Who said that the days of the neighborhood butcher shops are gone. DJ is just a real down to earth guy. All of his meats are fresh. I rarely eat meat and love the idea if I. Want one chop or a small steak, I don't have to buy a large pre packed package that will be going to waste.",2
"Oh boy, I was so so excited to try this place. I guess I should know better than to have my hopes up, eh but you live an learn right. So I will spare you the gore like details and sum it all up for you, with a line from Billy Madison. ""Don't go, Stay as long as you can! "" Bad food, Bad service, and I'm outie 5000",1
"We order the chicken catsu and there was a piece of hair in the macaroni and we ordered spam fried rice my 4yr old daughters favorite unfortunately she found another tread of hair in there. the first time I found Hair I didn't say anything I just pulled it out and kept eating but when we found the second one I was disgusted lost my appetite,I didn't bother to finish my meal ",1
"I have been going to Urban for a few years now. I love to sample all the different teas and of course indulge in the delicious food! I have gone with kids and adults and have always had a pleasant experience. Plan ahead, good food can take some time to prepare, but as I always say, it's worth the wait.",2
"Giant crappy carnival. Definitely not what it used to be. Still fun though. It's worth checking out if you have children. Not really a ""first date "" kind of place. Expect to drop a few bills cause of coarse everything is way over priced. I've seen people bring their own food. Depends on when you go as far as trouble goes. I recommend early Sunday.",2
"I'm from Oregon so I was VERY glad to see a BTH here in Vegas. I stopped on Mondays after my flight landed each week. nSadly, I found this week when I went to stop by for my normal Monday fare, they are closed and the space is empty. The owner over at Sunrise Coffee told me that they decided not to continue their lease and were now out. nNow what to do about lunch on Monday.",2
"Service was decent.we chose this spot because it was the quietest option available. family friendly yes.this is a challenge in vegas casinos food was ok chix fettuccini alfredo,eggplant parm, pasta with meat sauce, artichoke pasta and a garlic basil pasta dish with 2 mediocre meatballs. Similar quality of an olive garden.decent.good in a pinch but not anything i would intentionally return to",1
Agree wit previous review. This place needs a minus star. We went in and waited about an hour before we got our food. By the the kids were done so we asked them to box it instead which took another 1 2 hour. This place is worthless. I can't even remember if the food was good because I was so angry at the service!,1
"My girlfriend is not a big fan. Yet her mistake is thinking of this as a Mexican restaurant. I would instead call it, 'mexican themed.' If you go in and say, this isn't going to be a typical Mexican restaurant but instead mixes mexican dishes with different ingredients, it's really good. Got the garbanzo bean stew and the taquitos. Yum. Price is right, too.",2
"Very chic hotel. Love it! It's pricey but it's worth it, even if for one time. We fit a group of 6 in here.a couple in the bed, one couple on the floor and then another on the pull out sofa bed. Plus, there's a kitchen area, so you can def mix your drinks and just party it up in your room before heading out.",2
I am disgusted with their policy of requiring the driver of a patient going through an upper and lower GI to wait 2 3 hours in their waiting room. As a business owner I could have been productive but was forced to sit there or they would not do the procedure. To put in place a policy to protect against a few abusers and punish the vast majority is absolutely POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.,1
"The epitome of the five star non fine dining experience. Incredible flavors plus fresh ingredients and excellent execution gets the five star nod. Great complementary flavors on the Ronin Burger. Oxtail chili cheese fries, derided by some as sweet, are in fact flavorful. A bit heavy but you know what? In this case you can't spell heavenly without ""heavy "".",2
"This is a rating in service only. Jersey Boys let out a bit late, had a res for 8 30, arrived at 8 46, they gave our res away at 8 45. We were told that those are their rules and sorry. They could get us in two hours later, even when they were told it was an anniversary at booking. Nice job Gordon, rules like these will make you less successful.",1
"Aww.we ended up at the wrong Nanay Gloria's. I thought they'd be the same, but my boyfriend is convinced the other location is better and homeier. They had a ton of choices, except no lechon or lumpia We got there at 4pm and there were still quite a few people there, so they're continually refilling the buffet.",1
"I was really disappointed. I have been to several Brazilian stake houses and this one doesn't even compare. Salad bar is weak, they are so stingy on the sides such at the cheese breads and friends bananas. And they are more expensive than the other brazilian steak houses. The service was fair. Nothing special. I am sure I won't go back to this place. The one in Scottsdale is worth the drive .",1
"I went to the buffet last week and when I purchased the 2 for 1 coupon plan, I was told that they are closing in 40 minutes, but we still stayed to eat because that was the final day for the coupon. Anyway, the only thing that was good was the turkey. All of the extras were either old and cold or just awful looking. I will never go to the Seasons buffet again.",1
"We have been here several times to eat, the food was disappointing every time Overcooked lobster and terrible service. besides laminated menus give me the creeps I could go to Denny's for that!. The upstairs bar on the other hand is great for the view and drinks with friends. The bartenders seem to have a grip on service, clearly there is a disconnect between them and the food servers.",1
"I know it was after lunch on a Sunday, but I was totally not impressed with this place. You have to know something is wrong when everyone is sitting at the bar and stares at you while you walk in. No one greeted us and we figured right then and there not a good place for lunch. Bad service is sooo not cool.",1
"Taco bell is far better than Del Taco. And Taco Bell is not good either. Nuff said. Oye, I ordered the Macho Nachos without meat and ick! The beans were a soupy mess, the sour cream looks like it came out of some sort of canister and twisted around like a snake on top of my chips, and the cheese was a nasty, salt laden, festering lagoon of orange goop. AVOID AVOID AVOID!",1
This is a great store with a great Manager. Larry is amazing. He is patient and makes sure I understand exactly everything that needs to be done in simple English that a non car guy can understand! Equally as important I feel like they don't try to sell you but really try to help you and find more cost efficient repairs then always replace everything!,2
"Went to this place this afternoon, not knowing any thing about it. It had people inside and cars in the parking lot so I decited to check it out. Simple menu made deciding what to eat easy. The service was quick and the food was brought to my table. The chicken fingers were good, however I think the fries left some thing to be desired. Over all, not bad. I'll be back.",2
"this place has seen better days. perhaps it used to be nicer, but it isn't anything special now. the rooms are ok, but the beds and furniture are somewhat worn. they just underwent a minor renovation, but it appears it wasn't enough. i have since discovered there are better deals, and nicer hotels right off the same exit.",1
i have to admit I am pretty sad after my first few times here. I went over the holidays and found that the place was bought out. They changed the prices which was uncomfortable at the end. The stylists are still there but it was just different. Of course we all know you choose a salon based on the stylist not the place but after paying a great price I am not interested in the price hike. sorry ,1
"Just had the BLT burger. Incredible. Asked for it medium rare and it came on the rare side but that's good for me. The tomato was good and onion was nothing special, but the meat made it exceptional. Fries are the only reason it is not 5 stars. Nothing special at all. Service was great though and she kept my water full to the top! Highly recommended and can't wait to go back.",2
"It's a great trail, but very popular so if you want solitude don't go on the weekend. Still better than the crowds at Camelback. A good workout, especially the last bit where it is the steepest. This time we went past the cave and a little more towards the summit. Had to do a little rock wall climbing at one point. One of the better trails in the valley.",2
"Nothing here to get excited about. Not sure if the place has changed hands recently, but I remember a lot of people telling me this was a hot spot a few years ago. Anyway, headed over on a Friday night about a year ago and the scene was pathetic. It had a low life gangster vibe to it, and it just felt dirty overall. The crowd was mostly punks. The service was atrocious.",1
"Love our favorite local coffee shop, 32 Shea. Everything here is amazing. The cocktails, the coffee, the food, and the service! I recommend calling ahead if you're going to go through the drive through. The lavender white mocha is my favorite coffee drink I highly recommend! If you've never been here, you must try it!",2
"I've been coming to this place since it opened. Been to just about every thai place in town and I always come back to this place. It's a local secret! If your a fan of Thai food, you have to check this place out. The staff has always givin great service to me but I have been going here since I can remember.",2
"DON'T VALET PARK YOUR CAR AT SONOMA GRILLE! n 1, 700.00 worth of damage was done to our brand new Lexus while it was in the care of Sonoma's valet service. After several weeks of stalling and a bit of a runaround, they finally told us today will not take responsibility for the damage. Our nice Sonoma Grille dinner was transformed into a very bitter memory!",1
security guards are dumb as a door nob. bartenders are really cool. i think this place has a lot of hype behind it because it is not what they say it is by far. overall this place is run down and smells funky. ntip don't go here id rather go to the mgm pull next door they are synonymous the same exact thing ,1
"A brewery less than 5 minutes from my house. What can be better? This small brewery puts out some really good beers. I am a pale ale kind of guy, but the copper and seasonals are quite tasty. The tour isn't too bad, but due to the size of the place, it is over quickly. This is a great place to go and grab an afternoon beer on the weekend without your typical bar scene.",2
Horrible place. Menus on clipboards? Black and white decor. Floor painted on wood. Pages of wine. 1 page for dinner that needed translator. Ordered salmoot cooked through. Purple potatoes were crunchy as were heirloom beans. Yuck! Never mind the soft porn of couple making out through dinner. Not sure why management didn't kick them out. Even martini was bad.,1
"It's fun and Yummy! Had a blast with our group and our chef was impressive with his ""art "" and funny too. Food was good, and surprising considering the chef was cooking it all there. Fast! Fast service and delivery. It's not a place to string along a meal. You are served a lot o food and its one portion after another. I'm coming back.",2
"Not a fan for a music venue, Good music but really who wants to sit at a tiny table to watch a rock band. No drinks on the stage floor area allowed the fun police run around to keep you from standing too close to the isle or too close to the stage area with a drink. Not a huge fan of the area either.",1
Not worth the few dollars saved versus the in terminal rental car companies. Took about 20 minutes to get to the rental car center. They had two clerks take care of 20 to 30 people. The two clerks are incredibly slow and took about 10 minutes per person. Had to wait an hour to pick up my car and I was the 10th in line. Avoid at all costs!,1
"I honestly end up at Green every few weeks. I love the atmosphere, service and food. Whether you're vegan or not you will enjoy their food I brought my non vegan grandparents here for my birthday and they could not get over how amazing vegan food can taste . nThe menu is great and there is something for ANY mood. Although you've GOT to try the ""crab "" puffs. Also tsoynami. Enough said.",2
"My buddy's been ranting about how great this place. But even he said it was pretty bad this time. I was disappointed. If you have high blood pressure, the level of salt will kill you. Buddy even complained to the manager about the oversalting of several dishes. Maybe the chef was sick and couldn't taste the salt. Proper seasoning is very important. Good meat ruined. At least the wine was good.",1
"Who doesn't breakfast available on Saturday mornings? Apparently this place. Try to grab breakfast on my way to work this morning. I went to the drive through and another couple parked, an employee was outside told the couple that they weren't open yet. I happen to overhear since he didn't bother to come and tell me. Just FYI people work on Saturday too and they want breakfast.",1
"I don't have a bad thing to say about the Ho! nWe stayed here over Memorial Day weekend and had an absolute blast. The mid century modern decor is totally fun, the food drinks are amazing, service is excellent, and the room was comfy and large with a huge patio. nI wish I would have known about the rooftop patio before we came we'll definitely return!",2
"Im suprised this place managed to rate as high as it did. This place is just down the street from me so I decided to give it a try. I live to regret that decision. We ordered chopped pork, ribs, and some sides and I didn't like any of it. I couldn't eat it. The whole group felt that way. Maybe we caught them on an off day, but I don't plan on finding out. There is no way I'll be returning.",1
Great food especially the meatloaf and greens. Wings are great too! Friendly people but bare bones atmosphere. Go for down home cooking not the surroundings . nI like the food it is truly soul southern food. The actually place is nothing to look at but the service has always been very good. Very nice people good food don't be scared to go in.,2
"Dam you luxor for giving us a 20 usd voucher for this place. I take it its the only reason anyone goes. We ordered peking duck, chow meioodles and some beef dish. Honestly you can get better at your local chinese for 5.95 . Biggest mistake is the duck the wraps actually taste and feel like blotting paper. I dont think its the end of the world here but is definitely not what you expect.",1
"Not bad at all, I was very surprised that they have Vietnamese pho , the whole section of Asian foods in there, nTHE cool thing that not many people now is If you are Las Vegas residents, you get 50 off on weekday, except Friday, I paid 16 total including tip for the dinner, CHeap and decent, not that bad at all.",2
"Great food, great service, great beer. What more could you ask for? This is by far my favorite place to eat drink in Tempe. Their Italian beef beer bread is awesome. Surprisingly so is the chicken salad pita along with the pasta salad. As far as beer goes, hop knot is my favorite, but its all awesome. I would recommend getting the beer sampler at first to see what you prefer.",2
My husband and I truly are lovers of this brand however I think it is a flawed process. The drive thru line on any given day is 10 20 minutes which seems very long to me for what should be a faster experience than say walking in grabbing a table and sitting to enjoy your coffee. The employees are very friendly and the coffee is amazing. Just steer clear of the drive thru if you are in a hurry.,1
Beautiful hotel right across the street from mine last week. Kinda put ours to shame but I'm sure it was way pricier than my 79 bang for the buck hotel suite. Came here for drinks and was pleasantly surprised by the live band playing sexual healing in slow mo. had a 7 dollar hotel beer outside in the warmth of arizona with new friends. not a bad night at all.,2
"Very ordinary. Don't believe the hype. We summed it up ""Anyone who can succinctly explain to me what it is that I'm missing with Chop Chop would be welcomed with open arms. For me it's totally ordinary, completely mediocre, bland and inoffensive, much like their food. I just can't see what it is that inspires the level of adulation it attracts. """,1
"2 stars for frozen hot chocolate. yummm nWaiting time to be seated 30 mins nWater to be delivered at your table 15 mins nAnother 15 mins wait to take your orders n41 minutes wait for the food nFood was so so, not bad, not that good either. I only want the frozen hot choco, so I'll just order at the window next time.",1
"If only zero star was available. After one sip of my drink, I wanted to leave ordered a Coke but got a flat diet soda. I am allergic to diet soda. The food was just plainly bad. Couldn't wait to get home to use mouthwash and brush my mouth to get rid of the flavor of their food. Please, I am serious, when you want to find a place to go out to eat then go some where else. Not here.",1
"Great servers! The funky, skinny redhead gal was awesome. Great customer service. The lobster roll was okay. The bread overpowers the flavor taste of the lobster. The taste of the bread was very good but I just couldn't taste the sweet, succulent lobster. 17.00 for great bread? Fool me once same on you. Fool me twice same on me. I won't be fooled twice .",1
"Came here about 5 months ago to get my Vw Gti tuned and a few parts installed. Nothing but great service, great prices, quality work. This place stood out from all the other Vw shops in Vegas because they're the only Unitronic dealer in town. I come here now for all my maintenance work. I highly recommend this place. Shout out to Wayne, Omar, Sal ",2
"This place is a nice date spot.It was night when i went so the lights were low and there were candles lit and the fireplace was crackling, very nice. The food was very good, but will say that my first plate of pasta was a tad bit salty but they quickly corrected it by giving me a fresh place and they even Cooped my salad. So over all its a a 4 out of 5 from me",2
Nice rooms. The reason for the two star rating is the POOR customer service we received at check in. We spent 40 minutes with the front desk lady .She could not find our reservation.The woman that was helping us was the most unprofessional front desk staff that i have ever had to deal with in my life. She could not answer one question I had. She was more worried about charging my credit card .,1
"Not sure why all the good reviews. Basic comfort food, way over priced and nothing amazing, though portions are large. Chicken and waffles their speciality was just plain bad, chicken was super dry. Also service was slow and very rude. Waitress kept asking us of we were done since her shift was ending and needed to get our check done. Word to the wise avoid this place.",1
Bathrooms were dirty with no toilet paper. Staff fought about who was to take care of the customers so I waited 5 mins for someone to come to the register to greet me. Egg sandwiches come frozen and are nuked. Staff is not educated about the food or the coffee. Very sad this a new place but service is horrible. Don't ever get food at any Starbucks.,1
"This was a great find in Vegas. nA friend recommended seek this place out and it was totally worth the drive. nI shared a few of the curries with some garlic nan and spring rolls. All were very flavorful. nThe menu was expansive, inufing a few Indo Chinese fusion dishes and a fair selection of vegetarian. If you are in Vegas and have a taste for Indian cuisine you should stop here.",2
I have been to several Planet Fitness since joining a month ago and this location is the worst by far. The bathroom area is always dirty A light has been out in the showers for over a week. Hydro beds don't work right and staff acts like they don't want to be there n Not a good representation of the chain.,1
Made reservation for 7 45 and finally sat down at 9 10. Offered many apologies and a free desert but who needs the desert. I finally stood up and asked some friends that we're eating to share left overs and the bartender finally came to our rescued. Finally ate and food is good. I need my drinks comped while I waited over hour.,1
"I really don't understand how anyone can eat the food from here. Granted, I am Chinese and enjoy authentic food, however I like good Chinese American food. For someone who usually doesn't leave food on her plate unless it is really bad, I could not finish my meal because it was tasteless and below average.",1
"Been here a couple times for the XDC event and I've only ever really seen one track. BUT! When I do go, next to the track is a huge lake where people drive their different water vehicles and can do jumps I think if they want to go water skiing. I do get burnt when it's hot but when track doesn't get you burnt?",2
"Robert did it again. Took me a while to get time to get here but. The passion and love of the Fork has made it to north Scottsdale. Great food, terrific drinks and while not as rustic, a clean comfy place good for dinner and drinks that matches anything. and you know the food will be terrific. Got to be a regualr stop on the culinary highway for me!",2
"Delicious pizza! I was blown away by the fresh flavors, soft delicate cheese, crispy crust! Mussels were brought out with warm char grilled bread to mop up the lucious broth. The service was incredible also, we were in a rush and were served our meal with check AND food packed to go within 30 minutes all per our request and with a smile on our servers face. nexcellent, just plain excellent.",2
The only reason I'm leaving a star is because I absolutely have to. The nicest way to put this is that the best part of my experience was exiting the building. Attentiveness to refills was poor. Appetizers as well as main meal and sides were like warm and the fish was barely cooked and rubbery. Broccoli was barely cooked needless to say I will never EVER be back.,1
went through two different real estate firms. they all wanted to sell me what they wanted not what i wanted. thank goodness i found Dave Dix at long realty he listened he cared and we only looked at homes that met my criteria. i am now in my dream home because of them. if you are looking don't waste your valuable time call Dave Dix at Long Realty,2
Great wing specials on Tuesday and Thursday and their bottle beer specials make it for a cheap and very good night. We usually go to the Tempe location on Broadway but it is crammed with college students during the year. This location is much easier to find a table and the service is better as well.,2
"I'm obsessed with Zikiz. It is just SO good. The only way I could describe it is, it's like a Lebanese Chipotle. I usually get a wrap or a bowl, and they load it up with everything for me. I've had the steak which is great, but I'm really crazy about their falafel. I'm willing to go out on a limb and say its the best I've ever had. I crave this falafel.",2
We had dinner here. The food was mediocre at best. For an appetizer we had chef's focaccia. It was a pizza crust. Bland. The dipping sauce had vinegar mixed in like a salad dressing. It was not a good match. The rigatoni entr u00e9e was flavorful but upset my stomach. The waiter never asked how our meal was after we were served. I would not eat here again and I would not recommend it.,1
"I went there during the opening weekend. The place looks so cute! The desserts tasted delicious and well presented. The edible menu was a nice surprise. Pretty expensive, but what a cool concept. You should definitely try it once though. There's a minimum charge per person if I remember correctly, it's 12 per person, drinks not included.",2
"Love the number of gluten free selections, but not much else. The two stars are solely for that. We ordered take out, and the pasta and app choices left a lot to be desired. Pizza was good, but not for the price. The whole meal was expensive and most ended up in the trash. We won't be back. There are better gluten free options out there, and for the money we can choose from most all of them.",1
"Great place with great service. Our waitress was outstanding! The cashier, an older woman, was a bit gruff but overall solid 4 star place. Extensive gluten free menu and though I ordered off that menu they brought me the gluten version of the item. Thus be careful! Again, the GF menu is quite impressive. Toast, pancakes and a ton of egg dishes. We will be going back for sure!",2
"I love this place. I always stop here at least once whenever I visit Montreal. I ran into someone in Ventura Calif, who was from Montreal and Marathon came up as a favorite casual restaurant on the West island for both of us. The portions are very large, so if you plan to try different things keep that in mind. I've tried most items on the menu and have never been disappointed.",2
This Thai restaurant actually has an ambience. I ordered the pad kra pow ribeye steak which I would normally not order from a Thai restaurant and the Thai fried rice. Both dishes were well seasoned and tasted like they were made from quality ingredients. Chada is the best quality Thai food and ambiance I have come across in Las Vegas.,2
I was craving Dairy Queen for quite awhile. When I finally went I was wondering what I wanted it so badly for? I ordered a grape freeze. The icey slush mixed with soft serve vanilla. It was was so mediocre. I felt like I was wasting calories for the day. If I want a treat I can think of such better higher quality treats and ice cream.,1
"Vegans rejoice! The Wynn and Encore are thinking about you and are doing vegan with style. All the Wynn restaurants offer vegan menus, because Steve Wynn recently became one. We just had a delicious breakfast at the Society Cafe. The vegetable flatbread was amazing. My wife had a chopped salad with avacado and a refreshing lemon tarragon dressing. The service was excellent.",2
"We came in on a Wednesday afternoon for a quick glass of wine and maybe an appetizer, but we had such a great time we stayed quite a bit longer. Tracy was so wonderful and welcoming from the beginning. She quickly greeted us and made sure that we were we'll taken care of the entire time. Her energy was addicting. We will definitely be back to see Tracy!",2
"The first time I ate here, I thought, man this place isn't as good as the other flip joints I've been too around vegas. I thought it was too commercialized and overrated that it didn't get the quality of the food right. But the second time around, they got it right. The food was amazing and the service was good. I ordered the Lechon kawali and the adobo. Sarap.",2
"There is nothing remarkable about this strip mall nail salon, but they do a nice job and the salon is very sanitary. You can schedule an appointment, but one is not necessary. they encourage walk ins. The deluxe pedicure is worth every penny. The five minute foot massage and hot stone rub was awesome, especially after a long run. This is my new go to nail salon for a last minute mani or pedi.",2
This outlet always seems like a tornado has destroyed the inside of this store. It is never organized and you caever find a sales person to help find a size because they are always tending to the 50 people register line. I don't even bother with this store when I visit the Vegas outlets. I'll keep shopping at the Banana Republic outlet at State Line.,1
"This place reminds me of Chipotle Mexican Grille but with Hawaiian twist. Very clean well lit, comfortable atmosphere. The staff is friendly, and the food selection is simple but tasty. The real hidden gem in this place is the coconut bark dessert. I normally don't order dessert anywhere, but due to the staff's friendly persuasion, I tried it and loved it.",2
"Went to the grand opening. There was a balloon artist and some five sways. I didn't experience either but the building and interior both, are beautiful. The staff are friendly but it's obvious they are new at the fast food game. I'm excited that this McDonalds opened. It's so close to home and its my new morning drink shop. Only had breakfast so far. Gonna stop in for dinner soon.",2
Coffee was decent at best you could tell it had been sitting there all day and wasn't really hot or even warm at all. Very disappointing considering first time going and new to town and wasn't impressed at all. Girls working were not very friendly either. Seemed more worried about looking at Facebook and checking out pictures with there friend that was sitting with them.,1
"We didn't really go in with any expectations but the food was really good! The egg rolls were excellent and the pho was satisfying. For entrees, we had the combination fried rice and vegetable stir fy, both of which were solid 4 stars! nI would definitely go here again.btw, given the food quality and decent ambiance, the prices are pretty cheap, I think.",2
"Very nice and efficient office staff. Long wait. I wasn't impressed with Dr. Stern. Doesn't listen well and dismissed any concerns I had. Because I am active and don't have a history of problems, I was made feel like it was silly that I had scheduled the appointment. I am active but have been struggling to maintain my acitvity level. Wouldn't recommend this doctor.",1
I'm a big fan of chili's and having it on the strip is a great location. I took my family here and sat on the patio. We had a great view of the strip. Our server was friendly and the food was awesome. Overall the service was great i'll definitley come back. If you live in the las vegas area or just visitng come check this place out!,2
"Worst customer service! We use to go here from when they first opened.now the service is so bad, I wouldn't even consider going here. The owner is an ass! You wouldn't even know he was from Hawaii. Food is not as good since they keep turning over sushi chefs, foods not the same. Go somewhere else but here. Not even worth the star but they make you check one to post.",1
horrible experience in here. we've been waiting 30 mins for our food and then informed that they were running out of sth that we need to change a new dish. and this is not the worst.there's sth like a steel ball piece in my friends dish. They just took it away and then brought it back without even saying sorry.also the lady treated us so rudely.anyway.nothing was right in here,1
"This hotel has got to be the worst I've ever visited in Vegas! Elevators take FOREVER people kept complaining as well. Small rooms, double beds are twin sizes. Im 5'4 my feet nearly touches the edge. Bottom line, you dont want to experience this. nChecked out on Sunday to transfer to MGM. nEven with all the trouble of packing unpacking again, we didn't mind!",1
"Cool plain and simple. The ambiance and decor is great, the service is excellent and the food was exceptional. The pad Thai and appetizers too many to count were delicious. The bar area is great if you want to grab a quick drink and something small to start your night. If you are planning on ending your night here have dinner and get a line pass to the club.",2
"This place is fantastic. The perfect place to come to relax, read a book, get some work done, etc. Best part about it is that they have amazing baked goods, drinks and sandwiches. I've never been to a bakery in which everything they offer is absolutely delicious. The d u00e9cor here is funky, but that's what makes this place unique. This place is a must for anyone in the Charlotte area.",2
"Good food, easy access to our hotel Aria , very friendly staff, no complaints other than the aging of the steak seemed lacking in the nutty taste I'm used to. Maybe it wasn't aged as long as I thought it would be for the price, I can't say. Overall though, we walked out stuffed and happy with our experience.",2
"I ate there on a friend's recommendation I won't be asking for any for anymore recommendations. The two dishes I tried were both overly salty, I'm guessing to mask the flavor. The quality of food just wasn't that good. If you looking for food of this nature un authentic Chinese , give Pei Wei or PF Changs a try instead. They're much, much better.",1
"Don't try to order late night because that crew is lazy and will not take your order. They say they are open until 1am, she said no 12, we gotta clean and we will be her till 1 but you cant get no food.They were rude and unprofessional. This is the second time this happened, first time to complain. I wont be back.",1
"This place has gotten so popular and SOOO crowded it has become just way too hit or miss. Last time I tried the Tuna and it was so overdone, so dry, I had to send it back. Traded it for a burger. The burger was the same way! They need to get some quality control back so it gets back to where it once was.",1
If there is a place that cares more than AZO then I have not meet them! I can truly say that management runs this place like a well oiled machine that takes each and every customer like a patient! They care for you and your well being truly a place that has the patient 1st mentality! If I have not express how amazing this place is stop by an see for yourself!,2
"Very average in every way. Staff eating while making customer food. Way over staffed considering the very mediocre level of customer service. ""Manager "" went out to smoke, came back inside and started preparing food without washing his hands. Even though the drive thru business is very light, they seem to ask almost every car to pull up, park wait?",1
"I love this store! Spices, teas ramune, meat, produce, rice ramen, candy, wafer cookies pocky, naan paneer bread, sake beer and much more! Always something new to discover. The prices are great, too! If you like to cook international cuisine, this is the most convenient place to find your ingredients.",2
service was horrible. walked in and smelled even though they were in the middle of cleaning up. drink came out wrong and server didn't even offer to fix it. ordered nachos they were drowned with a pico that was nothing but onion and some tomato what i cud see of the carne asada on it was old and dried up. server new of my unhappiness and again offered nothing else. not even a sorry .,1
"AWFUL! I sent my margarita back twice and finally settled on water. I ordered some mediocre nachos, paid my bill and caught my flight. A few days later, my bank statement included one bill for the nachos, and then the waitress, without informing me, charged the 2 margaritas that i sent back to my card, as well, but on a separate bill. How deceitful! Definitely regret my experience here.",1
Used a groupon prepaid copon for dinner. Service was very good after that not so good. Food was luke warm and the salad was just average. The Gyro plate was greasey and bland. For 9.00 it should have been much better. I have had Greek food at many places and this one is at the bottom of the list. I would pass on this one.,1
A strange store. Lots of used returns? items along side older new merchandise. Find the right item and you get a bargain but it's hit or miss. A great place to stop by when in the mood to just buy something more substantial than what the dollar stores carry. But don't show up with a list expecting to find everything.,2
"What a special place this is! Lani, the owner, is just wonderful. And the place couldn't be cuter. It's always fun to pop in and see what's new. In October, there were these great little velvet pumpkins that my friends and I couldn't resist. Hmmm.I just realized that I'm due for a looky loo, so I'm heading there today!",2
"This has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. I have visited multiple times for the dinner and have also gone for the Sunday brunch. The food is outstanding. Well prepared, well presented, with excellent portion sizing and condiment compliment. The prices are very reasonable for the quality you receive.",2
"Clean. Clean. Clean. Did I mention how clean it was? When I stay at a hotel, it is very important that it is newer and CLEAN! HotelRed met my expectations. It was modern, the service was fantastic, we were able to have our dog with us, and it's in a great location. Oh and they had Aveda products in bathroom. which I love!",2
"I've taking my dogs here a few times now. Best place I have seen in the tempe or south Scottsdale area. I checked out a few before and this was hands down the nicest employees and cleanest, best taken care of facility. Their rates are vary reasonable. it's not too big so there aren't overcrowding issues. My dogs come home healthy and happy.",2
"Not a believer. While the name implies a health oriented restaurant, the food misses the boat. Processed meats, but hopefully, real eggs. Chocolate milk with a weird after taste milk ""product "" like maybe from a powder mix? Who knows. Nice ambience and good bread products, but skip this as a breakfast option.",1
This was my first Las Vegas buffet experience and it did not disappoint. The selection of food was superb and the service was awesome. There was a ton of variety and everything tasted fresh and delicious. TIP Get there at 10 30 weekday right as breakfast is ending and they are turning over for lunch. You'll get brunch for the breakfast price which saves you a bit of . I will absolutely be back!,2
YAY! I was so happy there was an Asian market SO close to my house. Everyone is very nice and helpful and they had some great samples. Loved how they had little eateries for lunch or dessert there too.The meats looked really nice and I was impressed with their seafood. The pancakes in the front YUM little bit of a treat for 0.75. Will definitely be going here more often!,2
"Skip the weekends and check out Sunday School or Wednesday nights, esp for house music. Better yet, go straight to the semi secret side room for a more intimate setting and better chance of good DJs. Girls get somewhat fast tracked at the door by signing up in advance on www.napkinights.com or wearing lingerie on the OUTSIDE of your clothes, of course .",2
"We have been here more than a couple of times, actually we were making it a Friday must for a while. Food is always good, from sandwiches to Lasagna. Wait on a Friday after 5pm is at the least an hour. Only complaint is that recently there has been a lot of new waiters waitress's that aren't as knowledgeable about the menu as we are.not a good sign!",2
"Love this gym. Has everything from basketball courts, raquetball, lots of free classes, indood and outdoor pool, tons cardio equipment, the free weights go up to 130 lbs dumbells for strongmen like me. There are plenty of hot looking women from early 20s to 50s. Most of the hot women do yoga or stair master.",2
"When I moved here from California, I was nervous about finding a new salon. I Yelped salons and found The Edge . After a year and a half, I don't know why anyone would go elsewhere. I plan to grow old beautifully with Rick! The reviews are all correct in talking about Randy and his awesomeness, as well. If you are looking for a new place, you really need to check it out! Nancy S.",2
"Pizza was Hot Fresh. I love when the cheese stretches after you bite it. That's how you know its real I love the concept of the location. You have to FIND IT! Cashier was talking too damn much and caused a long dredding unnecessary line! Serve the pizza, crack a joke a move on! Two slices cost around 15 with no drinks. You get what you pay for ! Sooo good! I will return!",2
"Always liked this place until now. Ordered the Asian salad with chicken to go. Got home and the chicken was bad.as in rotten, spoiled it can make you sick, bad. How could they not tell? I could smell it as soon as I opened the container and you could see that the chicken had that slimy coating on it. Yes, I know disgusting.",1
Great service. Intimate atmosphere. Comfy seats. Unique food drink options. Recently Updated. Oh and there's a classy bar with couches for when you're waiting to head into your movie. This week I went to the Manor for the first time. I'm thankful it's the holiday season and there are so many good movies releasing.more reasons to go back to the Manor.,2
"I am very discerning about my haircuts, and they consistently do a nice job. On a separate note, it's unfortunate that another reviewer is such a coward that he called out a stylist by name in a negative review, yet still tipped and probably didn't even provide ay feedback at the time of the haircut or allow them to try to fix it.",2
"Love the shows the promoters bring in. Cozy spot where I've seen Owl City, A Fine Frenzy, Landon Pigg and more. Plus they are generous with the Malibu Rum You will need to visit the bar to get your own as I've never really seen cocktail servers. Oh well. Atmosphere is laid back, chill. A large patio. And yes, the Shaker Room. The hot, shake your stripper ass, place to be.",2
"I would like to say Mae is the ONLY person in Vegas I will go to. I can't speak for the rest of the salon, but it is trendy and hip. I am sure they all do great jobs! I lived in Alaska for the past year and made two trips down to see Mae. She is fabulous and I adore her. Every single time I go to her I leave with excellent results both in cut and color.",2
Horrible airline. Do not fly with them! Was on United Express. Very small. Made us check my small carry on bag even though some people did not have too people with larger luggage . And security pulled me and husband over for extensive search both up and back. Wtf! Only dark people I saw that happen too.,1
"We were coming through Aguila after javelina scouting and decided to stop here to fulfill our recent craving of wings pizza and beer.and it was amazing! The wings were cooked perfect we got 10 hot and 1o bbq for our little one and both sauces were great, pizza was delicious and the service was super friendly and gave off that ""country homey "" feel. We will be back again soon! Thanks Daphne!",2
"Nice hotel and cool pool party, beautiful garden with real flamingos! . Starting to cater to a lot of young folks. We got a non renovated room, the furniture was old and the bathroom was not appealing at all. Really thin walls, because we know when our neighbors are in. The good part was that we had a nice view of the strip.",2
"CLOSED DOWN nnow Stacks kitchen occupies that space n nThe rave reviews never convinced me to give it a try. I'd think locals would line up for cheap great food, seems nobody else bought into the hype either? Having said this Hibachi grills were popular back in the seventies, the rest of the world has moved on . for a reason",1
Slowest service ever! And I don't have high expectations for mcdonalds but geez when there's a line with 15 people you would expect they would put two people on register. They're so understaffed too! The cashier took an order and then went to prepare the food. AGH. TLDR The people here like to work in slow motion.,1
"Well the grilled chicken salad with blueberries, strawberries, apples carrots, blue cheese crumbles, roasted nuts is fantastic. I had the avocado lime ranch dressing which should be bottled and sold in stores, it is so good! However, their new limited time mocha shake is not great. Should have just gotten the lemonade. I had to rate only 4 stars because of that shake.",2
"They got a bike rack glad I finally remembered to report it, now that I have something else to report Fridays the proprietrix' spouse, who operates a pizza food truck using Persian flatbreads, delivers half a dozen pizzas free for staff and customers to eat. Looks like my hair will always need cutting on a mid day Friday from now on.",2
It might just be that I'm too old for this place. I've been coming to Bar Kohl for oh.15 years or so. They used to have a more extensive list of flavored vodkas but the ones that remain are still delicious and unusual. The space has tripled in size since I was there last and lost some of its coziness so for that it loses a star.,2
"Love this little place. Food was great and prices are good. Although its a little dingy it seems like a place where they have ""regulars "". Our waitress was extremely nice too. Would definitely come back. Chicken parmesan was great and the mediterrean pizza even better. Very quick service and portions are huge!",2
The Bamboo Club in Scottsdale is still open and was always better than the other locations. The Scottsdale Bamboo is now privately owned by a local family. The menu is similar but offers cheff's specialties as well. The food is consistently awesome. Still upscale casual with the emphasis on casual. Great new energy and run by people who care.,2
"On NFL playoff weekend after a Saturday debacle going to a sports bar in a casino on the strip, and getting gouged we decided on sunday to go to a locals place. Glad we did. 1 2 price happy hour. Decent service. Great pool tables and no 3 sodas. A great time watching sports on their big TVs at half the price.",2
"Great food, great service just a little pricey for a date night. I would suggest this as a great place for a customer dinner. Plenty of food options that would satisfy anyone's needs. The sides were great too and large enough to share. I recommend the sea bass with saut u00e9ed mushrooms and the creamed corn.",2
"I'm going to say the pluses of this place are the super cool map of the US. I caever stop looking at it when i'm there, and the fact that it's 24 hours. Other than that.the food is not great, and although the service is friendly, i kinda think they forget sometimes there are customers. Only go for late night or desperate eating.",1
"Pasta of the day had no flavor what so ever. Regina Marg pizza was ok. I get their whole concept and what they're doing but when service is non existent, that trumps everything. You can have a mediocre meal as was the case here and if the service is outstanding you might go back. Not the case here. Was told to check out pie place across the street.",1
S W has always been a favorite. We always attend several wine week days and this year was no exception. nOur orders on Monday were terrible. The Asparagus was cooked dead and the Ribeye that was ordered rare came Medium. Other frequent guests experienced similar issues so apparently there is a problem with the kitchen that needs addressed,1
"I have never had a great ""gimmick "" and I use that word in the complimentary form come together with service, atmosphere, and amazing tastes and smells so well. I can only highly recommend the wine pairing. Our wine steward knows Josh's cooking as well as he knows his wines, his pours where bang on. nThanks Guys",2
"This place has been under new ownership for awhile and it has been run down terrible prices terrible food terrible customer service the service is so bad here that I will never eat here again and recommend Napoli pizza, maestro' pizza, cafe Verdi, Angelina's pizza any pizza joint in the area other then this place",1
"This poker room is nice. Good dealers, good servers, reasonable floor managers. Occasional sighting of name pros. I liked that the 1 3 PLO here actually ran like a true 1 3, and not a 1 3 mandatory 10 straddle. The only slight knock is that the lighting is a bit too dark and that it has less tables and action than Venetians room. Would come back here many times!",2
"it was my first trip to Smoke and had a great time. The food was great with a diverse selection of tacos. i got the chirizo taco with brisket mac and cheese. both were outstanding with a rich BBQ taste. the slaw was OK. place is small, cash only, and BYOB. service is friendly and accomodating. i reccomend it.",2
"Tried to eat here three times during a convention at the hotel, it was way too crowded and we couldn't find a seat. Staff didn't try to help or acknowledge us for a good 15 minutes that we wandered around looking for a table. They should at least change the whole ""seat yourself "" concept during a convention that thousands of people attend, doesn't work well.",1
"We had a phenomenal experience with our All Night Long dj for our April 5 wedding reception at the Flamingo. I had a bunch of specific requests and the DJ Tom far exceeded all our expectations. He was really friendly and personable, introducing himself and checking in with us in the beginning to ensure we got the best experience possible. It was perfect and I highly recommend All Night Long!",2
"The food was feh mussels were kinda tough but rolatini was good I expected better marinara. The beers were good. The service was slow. It's sort of like eating at someones house if that house was owned by an Italian grandmother that watched qvc and bought crap all day and wasn't cooking good food and or cleaning. A bit overpriced for the quality of.well, everything.",1
"Service was fast and customer service was good. However, the warranty covers very little time, and shortly thereafter, my screen was not as responsive as my original screen. I would hang up on people, add calls, and have lots of difficulty sending texts. I would recommend spending the extra money and going through original mfr to get screen repaired.",1
"This place is straight Legit. Everything we had here was fantastic except for the regular fries. I simply wasnt a fan, but the burgers are absolutely fantastic. Especially the New England Turkey Burger. The shakes are awesome. And not so super thick that you cant suck it through a straw. I will make this place a regular stop whenever I am in vegas.",2
"I highly recommend you avoid using this location. They are extremely unorganized! They are friendly however only a few attendants know their jobs completely. I have had to use this location for several different things P.O. Box, mailing letters boxes, stamps, change of address none of which were satisfactory.",1
"Honestly, I'm not a fan of fast food. But, I will always be a fan of In N Out. I love trying different things off of their secret menu! But, I'm definitely a sucker for animal style burgers and fries. I tend to always get my burger as protein style. Also, I have to have a vanilla shake every time I come to In N Out. Coming from a state without In N Out, this place is a definite treat!",2
"When your at a resort and you need to wait 15 to 20 minutes before the bartender or manager will even acknowledge you three nights in a row you have a service problem. The amount this place charges for drinks you would think they want to sell them. If your staying take a cab to a store, but what you like and bring it back to the resort. You will save time even if the cab gets a flat.",1
The food wasn't that great. The sliders were lacking flavor. The thin pizza was made with some funky dough. The kind of dough that you get from Pizza Hut. The service was spotty. Our server would disappear at times. He also didn't have much of a smile in his face and it felt like he didn't want to be there.,1
"If you can do a late lunch early dinner, you will leave MUCH happier. Service has always been great for me. Parking can be tight. Lines can be long. Short Rib Tacos. Did i mention the Short rib Tacos? period. Huge plate and so so good. Howie Burger is solid. Nachos are solid. If you can sit out on the patio, get that. I haven't had the breakfast, but i've had lunch dinner 5 times.",2
Still loving sandwiches here! nBut the parking is atrocious! I damaged my front undercarriage really bad trying to drive through this lot last month nI figure I'd just buy a 4 x 4 to drive through here and get my sandwiches n1 star for awful parking 5 stars or great food! nPS. This place opens at 10 30A for not 9A.you can call your orders in 10A,1
Their claim to fame is award winning pastries. We got there at 3 30pm and picked out a croissant which looked average. The taste and texture was the below average and I'm almost sure they use shortening instead of butter.it just tasted bland and a bit stale. Sadly the Starbucks pastries in SF taste way better. Total for a croissant and ice coffee was 10.,1
It's a Piece of Cake made our wedding cake and we were ecstatic with how it turned out! Cindy was very helpful and had a great sense if humor. She was responsive from beginning to end and ensured our delivery to the restaurant was seemless. We also had an atypical color and flavor request which ended up being absolutely perfect. I have already recommended them to a friend!,2
"Food isn't good. Service isn't good. Really wanted to like it, but it's just a waste of money and time. Edit Hi Rick, I appreciate your desire for a resolution. Not sure what to do there, I've had bad food multiple times there, and haven't been happy once. At other locations for Streets of New York I've had a significantly better experience.",1
"Definitely seemed like a landmark bar for local McGill Concordia students. small little tables packed with students drinking their body weight in beer. Great screens for hockey watching, think there may have been a pool table in the back of the bar. I can just picture this place being fantastic with snow storms outside very cozy collegiate atmosphere.",2
"They have a good beer selection which they rotate regularly. The food is decent, burgers and risotto balls are excellent as well as the grilled chicken wings. They often have good live music and the patio is a pleasant place to be when the weather is nice. All in all a good local pub, especially for Gilbert.",2
Dr haggard is great and listens to your concerns I was having very bad back problems about a year ago and did all his tractions and home tractions at home and working out at the gym I can say haven't had a problem with my back since and has straightened my back out from where it was a year ago thank you dr haggard,2
"Their summer happy hour is great and runs through 10 PM! Specialty drinks and wine glasses are 5 but you have to order only from their happy hour menu. Also, the food items are a delicious no matter what you order. My favorite is the fondue with green chile pork. This deal is only for the bar and patio areas not the dining room.",2
"Cafeteria style deli serving good food. Over my lifetime I have eaten at the different MM restaurants, all with great success. Today I had pastrami on a kaiser roll with fries and a pickle. The pastrami was lean, tasty and not to salty. The fries were hot, fresh and crispy as always. The line may be long when you enter but it does move very fast. Free soft drink refills too!",2
"Found not only one hair but! two hairs in my beef ball pho hahaha I had taken a photo and I think immediately when the workers saw, they look my bowl away sadly the phone which had the photo got stolen. It sucks cuz this is one of the few places who open late 3am but their service sucks and clearly so do their quality. Won't be back.",1
"I used to work at this hospital and I can say from being there daily that this hospital really cares abou their patients and their families. They go above and beyond to ensure patients are cared for in a friendly, non scary environment. If you have to be at the hospital, why not make it a great experience. Love it.",2
"This place can be alright if you stick with selected dishes. Rice dishes are safe. I think I got the pork chops and egg op la. Its not on the menu. I did not try the pho, but stay away. Hu tieu dishes, stay away. I ordered the hu tieu special and I can see how they made the broth from my soup. Some bones, yeah thats okay. I think cow tongue? i guess its acceptable but no.",1
"This to me is the best pizza in town! There are some close seconds but consistently, the pizza here is hot, great crust and the sauce is delicious. I am a fan of the simple cheese pizza and I have never been disappointed here. The owner is great and he is often seen being the one who makes the pizza.",2
"Hmmm Wesgate. Though i have had a lovely time here because of the company i was keeping. The truth is this little strip mall is ehh. Its pretty much another suburb commercial structure that seems to be taking over the Arizona land. If your in the mood for that or want to go to an amc you can hit this place, but its not somewhere to go out of your way too.",1
"They might know tires, but they don't know how to troubleshoot problems with my VW. They said I needed an idle control valve, but there's one problem my car doesn't use one it controls the idle by the ECU . They then wanted to replace the entire throttle body. My problem was solved by doing an ECU reset.",1
"I was in a pinch and my taxes were late, I was also juggling some issues with my small business and just moved to the Scottsdale area. I called Thomas' office and I'm happy I did. He was quick to answer questions and his prices are fair. He was able to clear up my tax issues within 2 days! I would definitely recommend him.",2
"I think this place deserves 3 stars but I will only give one because of the bad experience I have with the manager there. She seemed to be very nice at first but then she showed that she didn't want to really take the time to explain to me about the situation at all. nIf u don't buy glasses there, just don't come there because they don't like adjusting glasses that are not bought from there.",1
"The best ice cream in Pittsburgh! I've had so many different sundaes over the years. I recommend asking for vanilla with hot fudge and marshmallow sauce with graham crackers for a S'mores sundae. It is not posted in their window anymore but they will do it! nWith the traffic from Liberty Tunnel closures rerouting past here, you should TOTALLY make a stop. It'll be the best part of your commute.",2
"it was really good bowl of pho. is it me the vietnamese people don't eat meat at all? because a big bowl of pho only has 4 slices of beef and 3 beefballs. I think if any of you on Atkin diet, shouldn't come here, because they give out lots of noodle. oh the broth is really good, this good on a cold day.",2
"This store is super close to my house so I shop here for the convenience. However, their service is awful! They have a bell to ring if you get good service. More appropriate would be a foghorn to blow when your service is bad. It would sound like a fleet of ships were coming into harbor.Maybe then they'd have a better chance convincing us their fish was fresh.",1
Loved the trainers but unfortunately I had to move and they made me pay 25 of my remaining contract to get out of it. If I were just being lazy and not going that would be one thing but I'm moving out of state and feel penalized. Nothing personal against the gym but this contract thing is ridiculous!,1
"Their lunch special is pretty affordable, yet they are not the best Thai food I have ever had. Not going back to that place ever. I got the BBQ pork with sticky rice and papaya salad. The sticky rice is so not well cooked and I felt like getting grain. Papaya salad too spicy and doesn't taste too good. I requested MILD, and I am a spicy eater Overall, not very happy.",1
"While I cannot comment on the hotel, I can say that I have visited the Spa at Imperial Palace a half a dozen times. Its not the swankiest spa, but for the price and services, its great! I have never been unhappy with a treatment there. I have had two side by side massages, both wonderful. I am planning to visit in March.",2
"Maribel T. and her sister invited me to go with them one weekend and we stayed here for 3 days 2 nights. I walked in surprised, not thinking it would have a small kitchen. This hotel is made for a nice long weekend. It has a small kitchen, a good size fridge and a microwave. It's not located on the strip but it sure is close to it and everywhere else we went to. Also, it includes free breakfast ",2
"If you want to know how big of a check it takes to win a Best of Las Vegas award, ask Big Ern. This BBQ is bad what a disappointment. Rib tips are globs of fat, hot links are basic grocery store meat microwaved, brisket was bland, rolls were stale. Beer was the only thing good, stick with that. Staff was unfriendly.",1
"I have to agree with Carly G. As if the food isn't bad enough, the service is even worse. I had to meet a few friends here so I decided to stay but regretted it. We all did. Pizza is awful, spaghetti is right out of a can, or it tasted like it. Skip this one. There are great Italian restaurants with far better food and service.",1
"I don't listen to the station but they sponsored the BITE of Las Vegas this year and it was fantastic. 45 food vendors from around las vegas with plates for under 5. Everything from Famous Dave's to Hash House a Go Go. Plus a carnival and live music Puddle of Mudd, Metro Station and more There was quite a crowd.",2
I love PPP but this location SUCKS. Avoid it. If you like their pizza as much as I do then go to the one on Williams Field and Lindsay I think as it's much better. This location for some reason has been off everytime. I had given them 4 chances but after the 4th and the taste being the same. That was it. No more.,1
I came here hoping to catch brunch but I guess it ends at 11 30am or 12pm. Luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty. We ordered the Luau pulled pork sandwich the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick and the Monte Cristo french toast instead of regular bread slices delicious . Service was friendly and attentive. The dining area is decorated like a household very comfortable and clean.,2
"The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. The service was good, but the food lacked flavor and was quite bland. My steak fajitas and the peppers and onions that came with them were not flavorful at all. The re fried beans were overcooked and were simply bad. The queso app was OK, but nothing special. With all the choices in central Phoenix, I will be going elsewhere for my Mexican fix.",1
"Had breakfast panini, banana nut muffin and ham cheese croissant for breakfast. They were all so good. I went back the next day to try nutella crepe. It was DELICIOUS. I left Vegas a week ago and I still couldn't stop thinking about all the pastries, cakes and muffins from here, especially the ham cheese croissant think about this one every morning p",2
"I was excited to get a pedicure here because of all the options. Too bad the girl at the front desk had a bad attitude. I sat down for a few minutes after checking in and then had a question. Even with a second chance she still never every made eye contact or smiled at me. I ended up just leaving. I don't care how good a pedicure is, your customer service should be just as good.",1
Diablos is a great place to visit in Vegas. The drinks are good and the food is better. The guacamole is awesome and the nachos are great. Beware though the nachos are massive. No joke three people could split them. I split them with my gf and we could barely finish half. Try to find the girls handing out the free margaritas outside before going in.,2
The same great food as their Phoenix location but it is just missing the same old school charm of the owner yelling at the cooks to get the food out fast. It has a nice patio next to the ice rink. The main advantage of the Scottsdale location is the extended hours and larger seating capacity than their Phoenix place.,2
"Took the family for the night out for dinner. Wife and I had the BBQ Sliders, very good. Also ordered some Honey BBQ wings, wonderful! A bit heavy on sauce, but still ate everything. French fries were seasoned well, didn't have to add any salt or pepper. Wanted more soda refill though. We will be back and devour more wings!",2
"Das Zimmer inkl. Bad war sage und schreibe 12 qm gro u00df! nEin 13 Zoll R u00f6hrenfernseher ist schon seit 15 Jahren kein Standard mehr. nUnd wer einen Parkplatz im Hotel ben u00f6tigt muss das bei der Buchung angeben. Tja, wenn mans wei u00df. nEinzig das Fr u00fchst u00fcck war ein Highlight, jedoch gabs keine Eier. nF u00fcr das Geld eine Entt u00e4uschung!",1
"This was surprisingly fun! The place isn't huge and it's not super fancy, but they have black light mini golf and a little arcade in the entrance. We went late in the evening on a Friday and there was just two other groups there. If you are in the area and looking for something to do, it's a cheap hour of entertainment, especially with the entertainment book coupon ",2
"I totally love this little place! The family that owns this place are friendly. The service I've received have always been excellent. The food has never failed me. I love their Panang and Eggplant.I find it really difficult to avoid ordering the same thing, but it's just so yummy! This is by far the best Thai food I've had in the Phoenix area.",2
"We used a groupon to check this place out. Despite having a pleasant sever, the service was poor. We ordered the dumplings delicious , spring roll not tasty at all. Probably the worst i have ever had , and chicken and steak hibachi very salty . I can't say I will be back any time soon. It was just okay for us.",1
I work near Bakery Square and was excited to hear a new restaurant was opening here. I came here for lunch one day. I ate outside on the patio. I had the shrimp Po'boy which was very good. The menu looks intriguing with lots of different items on the menu. Prices were fairly reasonably for a sit down restaurant. They also have a nice happy hour with very reasonably priced drinks.,2
"The House at the Secret Garden is a tri fecta of REALLY goodness. nGood Food Farm to Table purchased often locally. nGood Atmosphere 1929 Spanish Style Mansion on surreal wedding grounds. nGood Service unpretentious genuine. nI have been there several times highly recommend the seasonal sandwich, brisket sandwich field green salad add Chicken .",2
"I use to like Barrows but this location has TERRIBLE service. I have been there twice, both times received unfriendly service. Second visit received the wrong order twice and was actually asked, 'Well do you want it?'. Was also charged the wrong amount. No concern or correction from staff of their careless mistakes. Pizza was as greasy as possible with no flavor. Will not be returning.",1
"I have a lot of health issues and a very limited diet. Trying to stay alkaline, and keeping raw, I have found many delectable options. My first visit, I tried the raw chile rellano, then the raw coconut curry spring rolls which were PHENOMENAL! I also got to try a raw vanilla cupcake with coconut strawberry frosting. This is currently my favorite raw food venue.",2
"When here after seeing it on food network. The country potatoes and steak omelet with a side of bacon is what I had along with their honey lemonade. Food was great and service was pretty good. Everyone was super friendly, it just gets so busy that the work crew can't attend to everyone all the time. I would definitely go here again. Probably one of the best breakfasts I've had!",2
"Total crap food nI came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. . nwasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. . nWould have rather stayed home for breakfast!",1
Bought chicken skewers from the butcher section and when I got home they looked and tasted like charcoal. Seriously ?!The person that burned it should be ashamed of himself after all that money that cost. I'll post the picture so hopefully they will see it and do something about it. Never had such bad food in there,1
"We were in the neighborhood and my coworker suggested we stop here for lunch. I spent a lot of time in the Middle East, so my expectation is high, and I have to say the food is fantastic! I had a chicken schwarna and it was hot and good and quick and as good as any I had overseas. I will go back any time!",2
"I went here specifically because it came up on a gluten free search. The food was ok but the service and oprn air seating were two great perks. The manager went above and beyond to ensure my burger, bun fries were gluten free even in a separate fryer . Highly recommend for the gfree people out there!",2
"I must say I was terribly disappointed with my visit. I grew up on tamales and was excited to try them here. When I did. I found minimal meat, chewy cornmeal and overall lack of taste. The olive placed inside too up a larger area if looking from the side than the meat did. Chips and salsa were good. But that alone can't cause me to like this place.",1
I was looking for a different lunch place and found this on Yelp. I have never been to a Firehouse Subs before. The staff was very helpful and they help me make the right choice. I chose the new brisket sandwich and let me tell you it was oh so good! Probably one of the best sandwiches I have had recently. I can't wait to return to this place. Yum all the way around.,2
"I've driven past Culver's a ton of times, and we decided to stop in for dessert after having sushi down the street. The inside is very bright and clean and the cashiers were nice and helpful. I had a mini frozen custard with brownie and fudge which was delightful. I do want to come back and try their butter burgers",2
"So I was craving an sundae earlier, I decided to pop by this DQ and got the medium size sundae with strawberry. After paying for the sundae, I was shocked by the size of the sundae, the server said he had weighed out the sundae too, it was as big as the vanilla cone. If you want every want a sundae, don't come here. Its no way as good as the Costco very berry sundae! Hands down!",1
"This place is great the Dirty Dog IPA is by far the best on tap. and the WI cheese curds are a great taste of home.I would say for 10 they need to throw a few more in on the portion size tho. all that said, this is a great spot for families as well with a kids menu and separate dining area away from games and smoke.",2
"So, I heard so much about this place and finally made it. Honest to say the food was really not all that great, It was either to sweet or just too sour. Our server really was not in the mood to give us recommendations. And I also think it is overpriced for the the amount of food. The restaurant itself overall is nice, but I think it is way too over rated.",1
We used Realty One Group for our short sale. Dawn Balani is our realtor and thanks to her kind and conscientious service we were able to close our property in two months. Dawn always took our calls and gave us weekly updates on the status of the sale. She established a rapport with the bank negotiator by promptly sending all necessary documentation. Realty One Group has a winner in Dawn Balani.,2
"Terribly overpriced. Maybe 2 bucks a slider at the most would be in the vicinity of fairly priced. I really just got overcharged ten bucks!?!?!? in cash and an absolute ton of calories for a subpar eighth of a meatball on a dinner roll. No matter how fancy they try to make it, and the toppings sound, it's a tiny, wholly banal hamburger. Period.",1
"To start with.you know how on the website it says it's only a few blocks away from Fremont Street? Yeah.if by ""few blocks "" you mean ""OMGZ WILL THESE BLOCKS NEVER END?!?! "". But once there, they are grumpy, but quick and efficient. My BFF and her fiancee now hubs was in and out within 15 minutes. Our walk from Fremont to here took longer.",2
"You couldn't pay me to come back here. The food was below average at best. I tried everything from Italian, Mexican, Asian, American food. Everything was sub par and the desert was bad. I would think if you like home town buffet then this place is for you. If not, head over to Wynn or Bellagio for their buffet.",1
Pharmacy in a ghetto place You're gonna have a bad time. Was a extern student there and i understand why the patients were upset. Too much work for staff to complete the prescriptions on time and there is certain insurance that is not accepted or covers the drugs. So make sure your prescription is covered and come when times are not busy which is around or near 12 AM,1
"I was so disappointed after reading all of the reviews. First off, I ordered the cold spicy cucumbers to start. They were bland and CHEWY. It seemed as though they were prepped days before. I had to send them back. I only had soup after that which was fine. I didn't want to order anything else after being served old food. I definitely will not go back and I work in the building.",1
"A fantastic place to spend the day. You will need hours to see everything there is. It is also adjacent to the Carnegie Art Museum. One price allows you to both. Here you can see dinosaurs, fossils, minerals, mammals, the list goes on. If you have kids with you, they will love the bone quarry, where they can ""dig "" for dinosaur bones. Great exhibits too! Very nicely done.",2
"The last time I visited. I was treated with good customer service. This place is located at Caesars Forum Shops. The staff was really helpful. Yes the store itself is small, but I found some tops and jewelry that I wanted there. So I was a happy customer at the end. I would go back to this place when I'm in town again handsdown.",2
"The food here is good, but the service is.Uggghh. Been a few times and am used to slow service or them forgetting to bring items, but today the female server was just rude. I don't know if she just didn't want to be there or didn't want us to be there.either way it left my table with a bad experience. Too bad.",1
"9pm on a Sat night and wait was about 5 min to get a table. Service with Jason was very friendly and burgers were tasty. About the only down side was that we didn't get our shakes until we were almost done with the burgers, but hey, thats dessert. Best part is that dinner only cost 21 for both of us. We'll be back.",2
"Unfortunately it appears that Jen had to sell the business the new owners keep pretending that she's on vacation and not telling people the truth. I heard they're no longer even excepting gift certificates from Jen, that is bad business and I cao longer get this place five star review I will miss Jen and I will miss Tom. They were great people and had a great business.",1
"I am a regular at this Place. My favorite chef is JJ, makes a great bowl of gumbo, very personable as is the rest of the staff. Hands down the best Oyster Bar I have been to in Las Vegas. Get there early, cause it usually is full. I definitely recommend this place for a nice hearty meal, fairly priced.",2
Got my oil changed for a great price good value and customer service! I plan on bringing in my Honda here for all future maintenance needs. The owner was friendly and I trust his opinion a lot more than those dealerships that try to scare me into doing unnecessary work. I'm happy to support honest and hardworking small businesses!,2
"Fun for Friday and Saturday nights. Also great on Sunday afternoon. Only one problem is that the line for guys is extremely long and unless you go early enough so you don't have to wait, that's the only way you're getting in. Well that's unless you're a good looking woman then you're always getting in. Great place though!",2
"If you don't mind the sour yogurt flavor, as opposed to sweeter fro yo around the block, this place isn't bad. I had the small size green tea flavor and was happy I didn't order a larger size. The green tea flavor pops but the after taste is like a carton of plain yogurt, a bit sour and kinda creamy. I think the strawberry flavor would have been a better choice. All in all I have had better.",1
"Interesting asian mexican fusion theme but taste is just ok. Great place to go if you just want to fill your stomach for a cheap price. Best part about it is the snicker doodle they give you with the meal. Ordering is kind of odd but nice that you can make anything a burrito, quesadilla or just eat it alone for all the same price. Place is bare bones, with cafeteria type tables benches.",1
"I was never much into shaved ice, but this place.let's just say I am addicted. I can't get enough. The ambiance is great with a hip decore and nice art. It has great location. The service is super good and fast. I mostly order mango flavor with nutella. They have great selection of topings to choose from. Many different combos and trust me, you caot go wrong. I am looking forward to my next visit.",2
"Good, but not great. The idea is not new, nor is it executed as well as Chipotle or Qdoba. Both are better. Maybe we went on an off night, but I wasn't really impressed. The people working acted like it was their first day on the job. Maybe it was. I thought it was OK, but my wife literally hated it. ",1
"We love the Cash. It is one of the few bars that have a smoking patio that you can drink on. We have donated a lot of stuff to raffle off for charity events at the Cash. They always have a great turnout. The crowd is extremely diverse. The drinks are good and cheap, and the bar staff is very friendly.",2
"LOVED IT. Healthy, Happy, VERY hard to find a place that is healthy, good, quick, friendly, and tasty. I'm here on business and have eaten here at least once a day since finding it. Excellent fresh pressed juice, great ahi cucumber boat, and everything I've tried has been great. I actually expect it to continue to improve along the way since they ask for feedback. Wish this place was in LA.",2
"ThThis beautiful restaurant, offering incredible views of the valley, is probably our favorite for Southern Italian fare. We have dined here for the past 5 years and never been disappointed. Portions are very large soe we decided to share a Caesar salad, eggplant rollatini and a cr u00e8me brulee. Everything was delicious and service was top notch.",2
"Well, I was here this August, just totally forgot to Review but here I am reviewing. As a kid, this place was amazing I thought it was the shining beacon among all hotels, because it had a midway for the kids, and a THEMEPARK! The rooms are way overpriced for what you get.other than that it's just your average casino.sorry Circus Circus.",1
"The food was really good, nice ambiance, great customer service. I liked all of the decor as well, I never considered making a lamp out of a wine bottle my only recommendation, if you go for the mimosas, request to have your orange juice apostate from your champaign, the orange juice is pretty sweet.",2
"Absolutely incredible. Great Cajun Louisiana sea food cooked right in front of you. The only down side is the number of seats, so you have probably have to wait. But the food is well worth any wait. The oysters are great, and the etouffee or pan roasts are to die for. All of the reviews have said it all. If you're in Las Vegas, drop on by the Palace Station and have a great meal.",2
Pretty boring there was some funny parts of the show but overall you'd expect much more. Most of the acts dragged on and got to the point I was waiting for it to end. Nothing great. But the last 10 mins was the best of the whole show. Other then the meh it's ok but I was mostly boring the entire time,1
"Simple but awesome. We enjoy a quick in and out dinner with a nice selection. We've eaten here probably 10 times and NEVER had a bad experience. The food is always good, hot, and fresh. The servers are friendly, and the owner makes a point of genuinely getting to know you. The beef tips are one of my favorites. Great slaw and of course they are famous for their fried squash.",2
"We took our family to Gilley's In treasure Island and had one of the worst dinning experiences I've ever had. Besides Very slow service and they were not busy, 2 tables in the bar section we were at Never received water we asked for, Didn't get what we ordered and it took an honest 40 minutes to get our final check. We finally had to get the manager involved just to pay and leave!",1
"Very pleasantly surprised . good pizza in an airport! I ordered using the self serve kiosk, and had a super hot margherita pizza in my hands in less than 5 minutes. It isn't the best pizza I've ever had, but usual to find this quality and speed in an airport. Staff was very friendly to boot. Pricey 11, but I'm on business travel.",2
"Very, very over rated! The only thing that stands out is the service. If you are the person that raves about a market sandwich from Pane Bianco this is not for you. Very simple and very average ingredients. My mom has been making sandwiches like this for me my entire life. I think I was expecting similar flair like the sandwiches from Culinary Dropout. Food Guy Out!",1
"This place was awful. We went on a busy Sunday in March, granted shortly after their opening, but being a chain, the opening should go well you'd think. The service was non existent after our drinks were brought. The food was just meh. This place caters to the East Coast tourists visiting the mall. Don't waste your money.",1
"The worst experience sending a package. I would never use this retail shop to mail anything. The so called ""supervisor "" Martin was rude and unreasonable. Once he was done over talking to a customer, he simply hung the phone. What happened to customer service.? If I can give less than 1 star, I would in a heartbeat.",1
"I must admit, I do like the brews. I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes. Other than that, meh. The food is pretty forgettable. Another ""brewery "" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department. With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom. But how would anyone know to? It's a chain. Whomp whomp!",1
"First of all, their chips and salsa is very good. I am embarrassed to admit how much I actually ate. Then came the chicken enchiladas I forget the actual name . They were also really good. They came with a side of rice and beans I just got rice because I don't like beans . I actually wasn't a big fan of the rice, but between the enchiladas and the chips salsa, who needs rice.",2
Horrible! Went to a professional to get these eyelashes removed and the lady said she's never seen eyelashes done this horribly. And she used cheap eyelashes that look like nasty hair plugs. nGhetto and not worth the discounted price. Regretted buying the groupon the moment I called to make the appointment.,1
"A new favorite in Phoenix! Was craving for Boba and stopped in. The menu is just the right size. Not too many selections to confuse, but enough to satisfy. Had the passion fruit and lychees Boba with half the sugar. Made just right at a great price! What a great find in Phoenix. Going to try the shaved ice next.",2
"I'm A FAN, because i got a great hair cut here. But. i got charged extra for sunday service. Since most barber shops are closed sundays, they reap the reward. This was the case for me. I called and searched most barber shops were closed, and i only had time to get a cut on sunday. I knew about this place in the chandler mall. And i knew they only deal with CASH ONLY. i would go again.",2
"I mostly don't do fast food and burgers but had an ice cream craving and remembered Wendy's has their dollar size Frosty. I Yelp Wendy's and find this one is one just around the corner from where I'm staying. Perfect, methinks! But when I drive over there I find they are MIA. So sad. I have no idea how long they've been gone but I'm SOL tonight.",1
"I've eaten at this Macayo's three times, and each time I leave unimpressed. The service is ok, the food is ok. That's about it. The plates I've ordered were drowning in cheese now I love cheese, but I almost need a spoon to eat these meals. I know some people have raved about Macayo's, but I'm not thrilled with it.",1
"Pizzas are alright. They recently got a new menu, and the items on it sound pretty good. But service is extremely slow. It was a weekday night and the place wasn't crowded at all. But it took 45 minutes just for the appetizers to come, and about the same time for the pizzas. Not so great when you are hungry! Be prepared to wait.",1
"Embarrassing. No chicken? We got here at 5 15, and the waitress told us that they had run out of chicken. Service was OK, and the food provided in replacement for our Chicken Pupusas was decent. I would avoid this place if possible multiple other superior pupusas joints exist in town. I would highly recommend SalvaMex.",1
"This is one of my favorite wine bars I have been to. The wine list is great and the food is just as good! It has an upscale feel and makes you think you are in NYC but without the homeless people peeing on the building they have a great vib going on and you will LOVE it! Oh yes, and you know what. it used to be a Post Office, SWEET",2
"This place, you'd think, would be a quick and easy lunch spot, but between placing our order and receiving our food, caterpillars turned to butterflies. The staff was very much not cut out to be in the service industry. Zero personality at the register. Once we did get our food, it was so salty, it couldn't be finished.",1
I considered having a piercing done. I had heard Halo was a good place for it. I went in and discussed what I wanted done and the ramifications. They were very clear about how long I'd have to stop doing any heavy duty hiking or mountains until it healed. I was not willing to give that up for as long as they said. There was no pressure to do it after that. I appreciated their attitude.,2
"Had a late check in and instead of the room that I booked, we were put in an ""upgraded "" room which was a downgrade in my opinion. As if this weren't enough reason to be irritated, the carpets and walls were thrashed and had looked like they had never been cleaned. Complained but no one cared. Will never stay at MGM again. Plenty of other great hotels in Vegas.",1
This time we just ordered the tiramisu for take out. A couple girlfriends and I were having a girls night in and wanted something sweet! It was to die for! I've never had a bad experience there. Make sure you have at least 4 people going or plan to bring home leftovers! The food is fresh and tasty and the service is delightful! A little pricy for pasta dishes but as I said the food is tasty!,2
This is by far the worst rental company I have ever worked with. Unprofessional with the application process as the computer didn't work so I had to wait a day after giving the holding deposit to find out I wasn't approved and then they wouldn't return my holding deposit even though it was their fault I had to wait a day. I am filing a small claims lawsuit for theft against them.,1
"Petit resto tr u00e8s sympathique u00e0 proximit u00e9 du m u00e9tro Place d'Armes. Ils offrent la meilleure soupe ""sweet sour "" en ville. Leurs dumplings sont d u00e9licieux et leurs nouilles fait maison valent TOTALEMENT le d u00e9placement. petits conseil u00c9viter l'heure du lunch car ils y a beaucoup de bureaux a proximit u00e9, mais dans tous les cas l'attente vaut le coup ",2
avg price and what not for an airport however if you spend 7 minutes to place an order to make sure you don't get gluten you better not give the woman gluten. And so I spent the night holding hair as she lost those flour tortillias. They did offer to comp the meal but if you have an allergy that doesn't cut it,1
"Can't get much better. The food was great and the service was fast and friendly. We had the half skillet and basic breakfast. Everything was delicious. The owner, Mario, came by ask us if everything was fine. I think this is one of the best breakfast places in Phoenix and we have tried a bunch of them.",2
I went in a few minutes until closing on a Saturday night and I was helped wonderfully by a women! I'm really grateful she was so nice to answer all my questions and help me figure out the right size for the necklace I was purchasing. The security guards closed the doors and the women still was happy to help even though she should've been heading home. Wonderful store!,2
"I always speak with Liane, She is incredible. Her dog knowledge blows my mind. the staff is amazing and this is the only place I will bring my pets. I have 4. Two very old and 2 pups. I know they are safe here. She always gives me updates on their daily activities if I ask or will have someone there talk with me. My dogs love it. nIf you love your dogs, bring them here for a treat.",2
"We had ordered a delivery to our hotel the first night with no problems. The next night, however, was a different story. The girl on the phone had an unbelievably condescending, rude, nasty attitude. So rude, in fact, that I said ""nevermind "" and hung up. Never been tretaed this way. I don't ever write reviews, but there's a first time for everything ",1
"I don't know what has been going on at Buonos, but their service is really becoming horrible lately. Told 35 minutes for a pickup order, an hour later the cheese sticks are cold and the pizza is finally ready. This is at least the 3rd time in a row this has happened. Come on, don't ruin my favorite pizza place.",1
The best vets ever! We have 3 dogs. These guys make you feel each pet is the most important ever. The vets will always call you at home on their cell phones to follow up and check on your animal. The staff is sweet and very accommodating. They are building a new facility to open in the fall downtown Matthews. Anyone new to Charlotte Matthew Weddington area this is the vet for you. Always caring.,2
"Holy. Shit. I was ordering possibly the simplest order ever. One large iced coffee and a blueberry muffin. The chick taking my order was so bad I wondered if she was just messing up to piss me off. She kept making up her own order for me. Then she corrected me on what I wanted. Needless to say, I won't be returning.",1
"Symposium is a great place to slouch, relax, have a decent coffee or, preferrably, fresh squized juice mixes. Service takes it's time, but is friendly. nThe star attraction tho, is without a doubt the wide assortment of very very delicious cakes and deserts. nSkip dinner, and go for the sweet tooth right away.",2
"Dukes more like Pukes. nPositives nAVG food and Descent service nNegatives nThis place is dirty the chairs were dirty and the glasses and cups were old and dingy. My friend was given and Ice holder that keeps the beer in the pitcher cold and it was broken and looked old and NASTY. nAlso a weird crowd with very little scenery, if ya know what I mean. Won't be back!",1
"I love the fact that Maricopa now has a dollar store, it was long over due. But there are issues with this location. They never have enough registers open to check people out making the wait too long. Another issue lately is their choice to put so many boxes of stock in the isles that you cannot get through very easily. If you plan on going give yourself extra time and have patience.",1
"I'm a HUGE fan! the 1st time i heard 'bundt cake', i thought yuck. dense, dry. rich So i reluctantly got dragged into that place by my friend.but once i tried the sample.OH MY! The Choc Choc Chip was AMAZING nMoist, light, yummy and the frosting is SO GOOD! The pineapple upside down cake was pretty good too.but my fave is still the choc YUM YUM YUM LOV U!",2
"This chain has slid downhill gradually over the years. Tried a Chicago dog, it was an insult to all true Chicago dogs crappy produce, marginal wiener, overpriced for what it was. They charge 50c to ""upgrade "" to a pretzel bun. Nice bun, hideously overpriced upgrade. You're far better off at a local non chain hot dog joint than any Wienerschnitzel location, in Brak's experience.",1
Over the years I've had Smitty detail my QX 56 and he always does an outstanding job. I know I'm getting delicate car for my cars from Smitty unlike the car wash places around. Whether you require ongoing service or the occasional detail give Smitty a call at Motor City Auto Detailing. You won't be disappointed.,2
"My favorite pizza in town! I love the thin crust. Sweet sauce, thin crunchy crust, gooey cheese. Great combination of flavors. Man, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I tried the spaghetti calzone so many carbs, so delicious. And for good measure, they make some really good chocolate chip cookies.",2
Stayed at this resort for one night and had dinner at Kosins. Service was slow even though the place was empty. Food was cold and mediocre at best. Resort was beautiful but restaraunt not up to the hotels standard. Will not recommend this place and will not return. Poor customer service from waitstaff and management. Not worth the price.,1
"Really great coffee shop with local art, meeting rooms, spacious reading area, free wifi, Kids corner, and friendly staff. They feature an open mic night and even a kids night where you can get a free small cookie monster shake for your little ones with every regular drink purchase. A favorite here in Henderson with tons of regulars. Great for the community!",2
"Ordered the spaghetti with a side salad and chocolate cake, the noodles were so chewy, the salad was warm? Weird, I know, and the chocolate cake, which the waitress swore by, was so dry. This place is over priced and most definitely not better than Olive Garden. Hopefully this review helps your decision when deciding where to go for dinner!",1
Not really sure what all the hype is about. We had the double trouble sundae two scoops of ice cream and hot fudge for 7. Ice cream flavors were pretty bland. Had the peanut chip and brownie flavors. Honestly would not come back here. Go to sugar bowl or sprinkles for better dessert in the area this place is pretty sub par.,1
Wow.amazing sashimi! The fish was so fresh and portions were respectable. We also had a great table in front of the waterfall.beautiful view! We had great service and never felt rushed to vacate our well placed table. O.did I mention the scallops.so good! Definitely check it out but be prepared for a hefty bill. 4 of us totaled over 500.,2
"SOOOOO GOOD! I've been looking for a good Chinese place down here and so far every delivery place I've tried has been mediocre until now! We got the sweet and sour chicken, Kung pao veggie dish, and fried white rice. All delicious and the delivery man was really nice too! Took a little over an hour though 100 recommend!",2
"Great store and cheap prices. They have all the games you can possible imagine, reasonable prices. Also you can play any game all day pass, login online use Xbox live. Play multiple players and save game. Also arcade games if you like old school, once I walked in I felt like a little kid once again. I will definitively come back many times.",2
"It's a good place to try out. Their 13 all you can eat in the afternoon is decent but a little too salty for my taste. The service is slightly slow and they are under staffed for what they promote. There desert ice cream is very good, try red bean ice cream you will not regret it, unless your allergic.",2
"Crazy Jim's is a small greek joint with an eclectic menu. They serve all of the following sub sandwiches, pitas, burgers, pizza, spaghetti dishes, gyros, baklava, calamari, and dozens of salad combinations. I've only had their gyros and pizza both of which I would recommend. Also the staff are always friendly and quick in my experience.",2
"My husband's choice, a restaurant for meat lovers, great wine and food, service is excellent! We visit Montreal twice a year from New York, for food, wine, and energy of the city. Plenty of places to try, and we do, however, L'Express is the one, we will never NOT visit. nI go for pickles and spicy mustard, the best bread, and the service. I usually eat fish. Great fish.",2
"Taco Salad was nasty, the rice was under cooked with only 10 pieces of chicken and over drenched with hot sauce. nThe vegan burger was full of peppers and very familiar to a sloppy joe that lacked full flavor. nThe macaroni was watery and needed flavor and the baked french fries were as hard as concrete. n ""Hated It "" and you will too.",1
Fascinating Place! The love story that this castle centers around is pure Shakespearian Tragedy. It will make you cry. On the flip side this is a pretty ingenious use of waste materials cast aside and re purposed. Environmentally friendly all the way back to 1930's. The price of admission 5 can't be beat. Definitely worth the trip!,2
"One of the best places in Phoenix to take kids, especially when temp gets hot. Not as large or innovative as the Exploratorium in San Francisco but an excellent time. One day should be plenty for the kids to see everything. Season passes are worth the money. Wish they would change the main parts throughout the year besides just the special exhibits, I would give 5 stars then.",2
"This place was awesome in every way. The food is very authentic and delicious. I tried everything on the menu and I have no complaints. If you like a superb middle eastern food then this is the place. Make sure to try the Falafel, it is the best in Az. Over all great experience and the staff is very friendly and I will be coming back soon!",2
"First off, it's a great looking bar which has a supreme location right in the heart of Old Town. We stopped by last night to meet a friend for drinks and to have a look around. This is the first bar in town that I know of with beer taps built right into the tables Coors XX . I will be back to sample the grub soon enough. Another excellent addition to Scottsdale's nightlife!",2
Food was very good. No complaints on that but the service oh man it was not good. We did not feel welcomed by Esther. She seemes bothered by us but there was no one else here but us! Place was empty. There was no reason for her to be unwelcoming. Will probably not come here again. Would rather go find another place!,1
"Terrible terrible terrible. After they lost my paper work, I had to wait 2 and half hours after my scheduled appointment to be seen. No one apologized and the receptionist was down right nasty. The tech who did my MRI was awesome and friendly and is the only reason they get 2 stars. Go to a different location!",1
"I have been in here about 4 times. Every time I have asked general questions about photography yes I have made purchases here also Every time, I got put off, especially by the Russian ? chick. Unless you are actively buying something, they are of little use. Go to a big box store or on line for the prices rather than here. They ar no more help than the 'boyz "" of Best Buy.",1
"We bought a 2011 Lexus at Bell. Our sales associate was very professional and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, the finance manager was right out of a movie. A typically use car salesman attitude and persona. He tried to take advantage of us both on our trade and lease. I will never buy another vehicle from Bell Lexus. Next time Scottsdale Lexus. Buyer beware.",1
"What's not to love? Their sandwiches are fabulous and the service is quick. Be prepared to wait a few minutes for your sandwich this definitely isn't Subway! . If given the option, the hot peppers are a must! I'm a big Capistrami fan, but the Hot Italian is hard to beat. Given that this location is in GVR's food court, right next to slot machines, I prefer to grab the food and take it home.",2
"Just off the strip past the Rio this place has it all loose slots, great sports book, movie theatre Kids Quest plus they have Nathan's Famous Hot dogs Famous Famigilia 2 New York natives. The buffet is one of the best around and they have the playboy club and smoking hot cocktail waitresses. nAn all around good time.",2
There store is laid out nice however I had a hard time finding my part. I only needed a gas cap and it was not apparent to me that you had to ask them for help with type of part. Signs to help you understand what is over the counter vs behind the counter would be very helpful. This way customers are not running in circles around the store looking for item that a rep has to assist them with.,2
"Although there are several tool stores in my area, this is my choice for purchasing tools and various small gadgets, not just for use at home but as affordable and useful gifts as well. Mid size, not as huge as a Lowe's or Home Depot but well stocked with many items, some of which are not found in the bigger places, and definitely with lower prices. Lots of frequently advertised sale items, too.",2
"5 . Outstanding. Great service, excellent wine list with some relative bargains. Just remember it's vegas. Had the soft boiled egg with black truffle and the veal cheeks. Dinner companion had lamb saddle. All delicious. Would eat them everyday if my cholesterol could handle it. Service excellent. A lot of young hipsters and dressed up folks. Would return tomorrow if I could.",2
"Went at Settebello after reading all positive reviews.Place is ok ,great service and atmosphere .Pizza was below my expectations ,ingredients are really fresh but they were missing on my crust, the dough was not done in the middle of the crust so we throw the whole middle part out.With lil touch in the kitchen this place can be a hit but until than I will probably not goin for another one.",1
"I've been getting my haircut from Rose Valencia for many years now. Always consistent and caring. Sure you can be a guinea pig and go to supercuts or some other amaturer barber shop and try your luck, but like gambling in Las Vegas you are bound to lose! Don't take the chance on your looks and for 15 its a tremendous deal! Tip heavy and tip often! You'll see Rose is quite a Rose! ",2
"nice breakfast place on mill. stand in line, order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. omelette with pears, havarti, sliced almonds and bits of bacon was good and cheesy. it had a fresh fruit cup as accompaniment. weather perfect and nice to sit out side. fortunately no one was smoking.",2
"This place has really come along. Jeff is doing wonders here. Haven't found anything on the menu that hasn't been excellent and the Craft Beers are coming weekly now it seems. The live music has started, on a small scale and will only improve the heads through the door. If when the Drink Specials follow, this is going to be the Go To place. New Diners Mention Yelp BOGO 1 2 Off Lunch Entree",2
"OMG, what can I say?! I have a reluctant sweet tooth but that's not a problem here where you can have the most delicious kick arse hot chocolate with chilli ever, I'm still thinking about it this morning! The only problem here is trying to decide which chocolates to buy and not wanting to buy them for everyone you know! As Arnie said, I'll be back.",2
"All about their fried chicken! Went here last Sun on the way back from hiking at Sedona. Hubby ordered the 2 piece fried with Yucca fries I ordered the 2 piece Grilled Chicken with rice Plantains. The star was the fried Chicken, but the Yucca fries came close second. The Grilled Chicken was kind of bland in my opinion. Overall their Fried Chicken is worth 5 stars worth another visit while in town",2
"Most places in Vegas are overpriced. This one especially so. Ordered a burger medium rare. I don't know if the grind is especially fatty or if they cook their patties in clarified butter, but it wasn't good. I just can't understand how someone could let a burger leave the kitchen in the falling apart, bizarrely cooked fashion in which it arrived on my plate. Not a fan.",1
"After dealing with Roberto's crap forever. Finally tried this place. Their meats taste like they actually took time to cook and marinate, and granted the service isn't expectational, it is a wonderful late night taco spot. Why ever go anywhere else again? That's how good this place is. Usually I'm sketched out by cheap meat, but not here. It's so amazing.",2
Love this place.if you are in the food and bev. industry here in Vegas.this is the place to buy all your supplies! It has everything you could ever ask for including an industry discount.just mention where you work and you receive a 15 discount! Have also bought supplies for my bar at home.great items for your personal collection too! ,2
I believe the cover is 30 if you're on the list. We had a table and the table staff was very friendly. The club itself wasn't over crowded and the patio was great to chill at if needed. The music was also a little lower in volume than most clubs so it's def more of a lounge feel. I would come back here.,2
"Miga Special. 19.95 for 2 people. Let me tell you how much you should never get this. nKorean pancake was burnt, and only had a few specks of onion and nothing else. nSpicy Squid was good taste. However true to what appears to be there style. The center of the plate was all sprouts and a very small amount of squid around it. nAnalysis Don't waist your money on this place.",1
"In the words of the great Leo Getz Joe Pesci in Lethal Weapon 2, ""They always f you at the drive thru! "" First I get drinks without the lids on tight so I've got a front seat soaked in root beer. Second, they short me an order of fries. Third, my daughters burger was overlooked to the point it was crispy. With I Out and Five Guys both within 2 blocks I won't be giving Freddy a second chance.",1
I did try this place thanks to great rewievs on Yelp. BUT WHAT A PLACE OF BAD FOOD. Mussels soggy and old nChevre chaud nothing speciell just boring n nSurf and turf Lobseter soggy and old meat dry nLobster soggy and not fresch n nAnd the last bonus Creme Brulee at a french restaurant? it was so bad actually the worts i tried. Staff was ok and audience vibrant. Will not return.,1
"Yech. I wanted to give it one star but my son said that was too harsh. The garlic bread was good, and the mussels were really good. But the Mediterrean chicken was way overcooked and hard. My salmon was thin, overlooked, and fishy. The house salads were passable. I think we dropped about 60. It was definitely not worth it.",1
"Lovely waitstaff, atmosphere and food! Best combination, the trout, wine and chocolate mousse was absolutely delicious. The crust in the open face trout had a perfect crunchy sear and still moist inside. Can't beat the view if the dancing Bellagio Fountains while enjoying the meal. When the weather is beautiful, this is the place to go!",2
Excellent! My wife and I went for the happy hour 1 tacos 3 margaritas and we were not disappointed! Go for the soft shell tacos and order some guac on the side and Enjoy! Staff was friendly and quick and the price was right. Family friendly and has a little patio with about four tables if you like to sit outside. Definitely going back!,2
"I stayed here for 1 night atmosphere is great especially on fridays and saturday nights, the bar is crackin and so is the pool and roof top the staff is friendly and the hotel is clean and modern looking. I would recommend this place to couples or single people not much for families just cuz its got that bar patio vibe to smoke and drink.",2
"I used to occasionally dine at Panda Express when I wanted a cheap meal and to just kick back and chill. The problem is that the food seems to sit out there for a long period of time or they would spoon out the last batch to me sans most of the chicken. In other words, their portion ratio of meat to vegetables is never consistent.",1
The pizza is really good. The slices are huge. The house salad is super amazing. The creamy Italian dressing is yummy. The customer service is fabulous. They are so friendly and energetic! I will definitely be back for another salad and pizza. The interior is very woodsy and cool looking. I recommend this place if u live in the area and even if you don't since it is awesome!,2
"What a joke. Ordered the blueberry waffles. Comes with blueberries on top must have come out of the freezer so needless to say waffles cold. 2nd order comes out, blueberries on the side still cold put some butter on it and it was whipped butter it didn't even melt. But the date glazed bacon was good !",1
"It's great! I was never a huge fan of Bobby Flay until I ate here. I don't think it's overly priced. It's about 50 person. I would've loved to try their desserts, but I was too full. nI ordered the chicken and it was moist! Couldn't really believe it when I bit into it. Moist, juicy and the sauce was so yummy!",2
"This is a truly great market. I wish we had places like this in the U.S. There are a ton of great looking food shops, fresh meat, cheese or fromage if that's how you roll a bakery. All of the food looked super delicious. We ate at the patisserie twice during our stay in Montreal and everything we had was excellent.",2
"This place is terrible. The customer service was absolutely the worst I've experienced in a long time. The people in the booth next to us shot a rubber band at us while eating and the waitress, Stephanie, laughed about it. I will NEVER come back to this place again. The food was decent, minus the fact that it took forever to get it and even longer to get the check.",1
"Favorite thai food place I've tasted in a while. Not only are their prices way cheap for the wonderful quality of their food, their service is always quick and friendly. I guess you can say I might be a regular. Favorite dish is green curry, never gets old! Also the take out saves me sometimes when I'm too lazy!",2
Worst show ever. I'm surprised that cirque even produced such a horrible show. The constant suggestions that it's unnatural for heterosexual meot to experiment with homosexuality or beastiality is repulsive. Constant persuasion that it's ok to commit adultery is disturbing. What makes this 1000 times worse is the tactic of the cast encouraging the crowd to clap causing massive manipulation. So bad,1
"Very disappointed. Went in at 12 30 on father's day to get some doughnuts for a treat. A lady was sweeping at the door, we paused and she did not smile or say hello. First turn off. The next was the only doughnuts were 2 fritters. They also had 2 stuffed croissants in the case. the menu they had for food had items crossed off so due to lack of options we went elsewhere.",1
"Two plates and a tiny appetizer 48.00 nNow if it were worth it no problem BUT the wonton soup had no flavor, noodles were under cooked . The soup it's self wasn't filling , such a huge bowl for a tiny serving. Bring your own hot sauce since they don't have any. This place looks to be great but don't be fooled. Never ever coming back.",1
"I've dealt with three ""supervisors "" in regards to getting my room. Though I have a confirmatioumber with my name, and a reservation in the system, Bally's won't give me the room we purchased. A friend and I booked through Expedia and due to some mix up, they are now leaving us with the option paying for a second room. No refund is being offered by Expedia for the mix up.",1
"Quite a disappointment. Service was extremely slow and. odd. Food was really overpriced for the quality. I think the ravioli I had was from a freezer pack. This was nothing I couldn't have easily made from home. Overall, an expensive lesson in eating at Romeo's. Won't happen again. Update leftovers were inedible due to incredible amounts of oil.",1
"Went in for a basic wash vac in February and got the hard sell to buy a multi wash pack. The sales writer couldn't understand the word no and wouldn't give me the ticket. Told me to wait inside and he would bring it in. I finally went back out to ask for the ticket and was berated for getting free armor all and not taking the ""deal "". Tore up my loyalty card, never going back!",1
"I was glad to grab an appointment, and arrived early. They were unable to see me early, which is fine, but then I had to wait 25 minutes after appt time, without notice, forewarning, anything. Water was cold, theot enough time for manicure, girls were in a hurry to close up and get out. One even had a customer pre pay her services so she could leave early. I will not be back.",1
"La Quinta InCategory Hotels n5 29 2011 nIf you are really desperate and strapped for cash, then I guess this will do. This place is in a really ghetto area. 30 minutes away from the strip. Staff was wonderful and very helpful. We actually canceled our booking cause the place around the area was just really creepy looking.",1
First impression as you enter is simple yet sophisticated. Amazing decor. Very tasty vegetarian options. My date ordered a dish with some sort of shaved fish on the top that undulated.At first I thought that the lights were flickering but no this food was moving but not alive. Freaky but in a good way,2
This school is ran very poorly. Teachers are good but administration is terrible. If there's any kind of major issue such as bullying or harassment the principal will do nothing about it. In fact she will get defensive and lose her temper at parent student filing a complaint. I'm very relieved to have my child moving on to bigger and better things.,1
"Great bagels, friendly people, quick service, nice modern decor and spectacular drawing on the menu in the wall . nThey sweat the little details like the sauce and condiments section all nearly stacked. nThe girls that work there are all young so they might not be the most refined taking the dishes and trays out of your way but they do smile all the time!",2
Logan was exceptional in customer service! He tailored everything to our specific needs. He mentioned ways we could save money on our plan. He went out of his way to make sure we got exactly what we came in for. Best wireless experience ever. I will continue to do all Verizon business with him at this location.,2
"I had previously marked a great rating for this store, but that was only for Coach Katie who is no longer with the company. The place has fallen apart. Its a revolving door with teachers and scheduling is a nightmare. My son was there for 2 years and I feel he was nowhere near where he should be. I taught him in an above pool within a week. Waste of money.",1
"Not the worst Walmart I have ever been to, but by far not the best. No one in the store knows where anything is or knows how mix paint either. The lines are very very long so you better bring a book. Unfortunately Walmart has a monopoly so we as Americans really have no choice but to use their store.",1
"First time at this hotel and I love it here! Rooms are nice, hotel Is nice, no smoke smell, 24 7 Starbucks in lobby, got a cab right Away and most importantly they are pet friendly walking distance to battistas yummy Italian restaurant. Also walking distance to the strip. Across the way from ballys hotel. Ill def stay here for future trips!",2
"Pros nThis review is for the Teppenyaki side. nFood is incredible. nI have been here a dozen times and it's always amazing. nThe chefs are amazing, witty and very personable. nA ton of celebrities eat here. Their pictures are all over the walls so you know it's reputable. nTheir happy hour after midnight is great 17 for NY Steak and Chicken combo Pros nNone nI think they kill Beninhanas.",2
"Went there about 3 times but the last time we went seemed like they are cutting back on hoppings. We ordered mushrooms, onions abs garlic. Barely any mushrooms were on the pizza, the garlic was MINCED. So basically it was an onion pizza with barely any sauce also. I can see why they charge for extra sauce.",1
Friendly new ownership. Little disappointed it took close to 2.5 hours for a new set and a pedicure and I was the only person in. Price was a little high for my liking. 80 with tip for a full set and pedicure. Did a standard French tip acrylic set and French tip pedicure. My full set was uneven and grew out pretty gross. Sad as it was my go to close to the house. Have found a new place!,1
"The Heard Museum is amazing. I've only been here once, during one of their free attendance days. Although there are some kid oriented exhibits, teens and adults will get the most out of this museum. The Kachina exhibit is wonderful. All of the art is breath taking. The Indian school exhibit is heart breaking. I highly recommend going to this museum at least once, especially if you live in AZ.",2
"Eh. We had a gift certificate to this place off of our player's cards. It was good, but drastically overpriced. I would have been just as happy going to Maggianos or something like that. I had the penne with vodka sauce, and it was not memorable. It was good, don't get me wrong. Just not 20something dollars good! Meh, I wouldn't return when there are so many other great places to eat at in Vegas.",1
"LOVE grabbing a dirty martini here! But, that's about all that fascinates me about Paris. It's the only reason why we ever stop by. I've stayed here in the past and I was always extremely underwhelmed with the rooms, the casino, the restaurants and the level of customer service. For what you pay, you have about five other much better and much nicer properties to spend your dollars at.",1
"Sometimes plain and simple is best, and it can be harder than you'd think to get plain and simple right. Lucky Boy gets plain and simple done perfect every time. Never had cold fries or overdone burgers here, your meal is always, always hot and fresh and ready to be devoured. I like to go local rather than chain fast food when I do fast food, and Lucky Boy satisfies all of that.",2
I tried this place for the first time and will definitely go back. The filet and prime rib were something special. The flavor of the grilling technique is some of the best. I love that you get a whole dinner not alacart. The service was alittle on the slow end but the chef makes up for it. New favorite spot and the ambiance is very cozy and inviting.,2
I've visited the bond on several occasions and it seems to be going down hill. Service is super slow even on a slow night. Waitresses are very impersonal and unfriendly. On my latest trip I bought a martini and my friend bought a soda. After waiting 10 minutes the martini came out at about room temperature and they brought my friend's drink in a plastic cup.,1
"I ordered the basil burger and it was very juicy and well cooked. The onions and mushrooms were not too soft. I actually enjoyed the little pasta salad that came with the meal. Expect to spend 10 15 for lunch. Also, they have a rewards program that is worth joining. You get a 15 credit for every 100 spent. Not bad!",2
"Food is excellent, along with the service! I'll be coming back for sure! nI ordered a combo with Lemon Chicken Kung Pao chicken. The combo also came with soup to start a spring roll on the side. I couldn't eat it all and for 10, I got 2 meals out of it! My boyfriend ordered the stir fry with chicken. We both agree this place has fresh, tasty food!",2
"Stay away from this place! I called days in advance to get a set appointment for my nails. When I arrived they told me it will be a few minutes. I sat in the waiting chair patiently. 15 minutes , 20 minutes.now 30 minutes has come and gone. I think they actually forgot about me. I will never go back there. Hope this is a helpful warning to everyone!",1
"Good people, good service, and really good sweet tea! I have only been here once, but because of the friendly service the delicious sweet tea, I will be making another trip to see them as soon as I can to try some of their other options. No grouchy workers here, just some nice guys selling some good drinks ",2
I really enjoy this Starbucks and wish it was closer to my home. Most Starbucks are created equal as far as product goes but this location offers superb customer service. The employee working the drive thru is always incredibly friendly and makes small talk.a nice gesture that doesn't happen very often anymore. Will return whenever I can for my caramel macchiato!,2
"So good, I eat here at least once a week and never tire. The pickled onions are crack! Chicken and steak both marinated, freshly grilled deliciousness. Beans, rice, and salsa all delicious a fresh too. Cheap and high quality. Combine tortillas, rice, steak, onions, salsa and sour cream to make tacos then thank me later. Crazy good.",2
"The worst food I've ever had. Service was okay he only check on us twice, warm soda had to nWater it down with ice to make it cold. our food sucked. Just yucky good. Huge plates. Just yucky food. Pictures does lie. What looks good is not always good. My husband was like ""we should of went to fat burger! "" Lol.",1
"This place is pretty uninspiring. I feel like you can make anything edible with the magic buffalo sauce but this was still pretty lame. They have some all you can eat wings and tots bar during lunch, but I did not partake. Next time I have a chicken craving I will probably hit up Chick fil a or Zaxby's instead!",1
Decided to stop by to have two of my watch batteries replaced. Read the great reviews. Arrived at 9 50 AM to find the shop opens at 10 AM. I waited. Another car came at 10 and the driver went to the door. Still locked. I waiting ten more minutes and decided to leave. Only can decide the shop is great but it failed to open on time. Chose to go to another shop.,1
"Update they swapped our leftovers. Handed it to us saying what they were, and they were wrong. No biggie for me because full disclosure, I ate the vegan's soup, and I liked it. Probably less fun for her though. Not removing a star because this io way detracts from the joy and wonder of the food. Just a heads up to double check your cartons.",2
"Golfball size meatballs. I mean tiny. What's this?! No Italian I know makes these teeny meatballs. Almost 10 for 6 meat golf balls. Sad. And the flavor? Nothing remarkable. For anyone who was lucky enough to experience the huge 10 meatball and farm fresh ricotta appetizer meal! at Jr's Place near Russell Durango now closed, boo hoo! there's really absolutely no comparison.",1
I love earls! I wished they opened one in the bay but it's a must have when in Vegas. They're open 24 7 so for all you clubbers n late owls this is the spot for you. I love the original but the chicken avocado is amazebawlss. The tomato soup hits the spot. Pretty much everything is good here! Definitely recommend,2
I haven't been here in years but went yesterday for happy hour. Now I know exactly why I haven't been here in so long. The sushi is OK but the service was terrible. We never received our edamame or our soy sauce for the sushi. It also took forever to get change back from our bill. I will never step foot into this place ever again.,1
"Used to be the Imperial Palace. It is like a maze in there and it is outdated even though they are doing renovations. It was very affordable and clean though. The thing that bothered me was that my window on the 12th floor didn't lock. Not that I would think someone would be stupid enough to go out on the balcony and walk into my room, but in Vegas, you just never know!",1
"Honestly, would have walked to the food court around the corner, but seeing as how I predicted I'd be at the food court later in the AMs.I chose to go with the ""healthier better guiltless "" option. Had the Roasted Turkey. Good. Nothing to rave about. Put me in walking vicinity of Earl's and I'd go there 100 .",1
"We saw his Christmas show. WONDERFUL. A great talent, he can sing and is entertaining. I would like to return for a non Christmas show. But all his characters are wonderful. Theater hint Sit towards the center and closer to the stage so you don't have to view most of the show on the screens. Our entire group LOVED THE SHOW and each said they would come back again.",2
"If you are craving pizza that tastes like it as actually from New York forget this place. Not even close. It should be considered false advertising to include ""New York "" in your name. It implies the food is similar to food you would find there. This place would not last a week if it was in New York. That should tell you something!",1
"I had some pretty good sushi at this place last week. I didnt even know it was there! The inside and atmosphere is pretty laid back and chill. The sushi is good, we had 4 rolls and they were all good size and all tasted great! Our waitress was very friendly and made sure we were always hydrated! I am for sure gonna come back here!",2
This place is horrible. The tables and floors are always dirty. There is also a weird smell on the west side of the restaurant. The staff is friendly but a little on the rough side looks wise. The food is either over cooked or cold and stale. I would suggest spending your hard earned money on the Chilis across the street.,1
"On a mission for karaoke on a Friday night, a convoy of Yelpers ended up at this DIVE! nNice selection of beers on tap, pool tables, darts and karaoke. Cowboy is my new guru, he knows what's up! If it weren't for a terrible headache I would have probably closed this place down. It was a fun visit that's fo' sho'!",2
"Very average. But was free so didn't care. Would not pay for this, tough. Small selection and low quality. Was filling but with so many options in the city. Will probably only go if starving and free. Not horrible but just not really special. Although, new owners might change that. Haven't been there since the change.",1
Great food! Old style at the other location best chitown food in vegas.at both locations the food is great a little pricer than in Chicago like 22 bucks for wings and pizza deal w 3 toppings.great spot.I highly recommend any Chicagoland area las Vegas residents go for a taste of home! Never disappointed staff is great and they got jays potato chips,2
"This place is run by a bunch of incompetent retards. I NEVER get what I order, I always have to have them remake it. They are extremely disorganized. It takes forever to place your order because they are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I only come here because of the location.",1
"We travel a lot and are wintering here for several months . This is the worst wal mart we have been in from carts all over the parking lot.shelves needing stocking and loooong lines at cashier stand. Wal mart is known for it low pay and you can see it here with the attitude of the help. This joint is only a mile away but we will not be shopping here in the future,",1
"According to their listed hours they are open until 11 p.m. Mon Thurs but they closed the kitchen at 9 30 with no warning, ruining our plans. Super unprofessional, like just about all downtown establishments, but that's beside the point. This is downtown Las Vegas why do you close at 9 30? Given the other reviews and my own experience, I won't be back.",1
luv walking in this place. i always feel welcomed. i have gone to them since they opened. christian always makes you feel like family and we luv that pops is always on the line cooking. customer service is always at its best and it doesnt matter what you order because its gonna taste like it was made with luv and you're gonna fall in luv.,2
We had Marcos delivered last week and it was amazing! We ordered a large thin crust pizza with extra pepperoni. The crust was great! Only small issue we had is that our round pizza was cut into squares. We weren't used to that. We also got a free order of the cheese bread that was the best cheese bread I've had delivered with a pizza. Very tasty. Highly recommended!,2
Stayed over MLK weekend and hotel was full. Glass under desk that was not cleaned after calling and telling cleaning crew. Wi Fi was down and tech brought me in to other rooms with other patrons personal belongings and left me in one room while he knocked on other doors . nThey gave me a 2 for 1 buffet ticket for the trouble. Whoopie! nOne star since they were at peak capacity.,1
I've eaten here before and I always try to support local businesses but the owner cook won't make my food the way I want. He was yells at his employee non English speaking undocumented worker then a server is screaming the whole time sitting at the bar making the environment stressful and tense we won't be back. A lot like southern Cali restaurants just super unprofessional.,1
Worst buffet I've ever been to. Overpriced and terrible quality. We ate dinner and it was so terrible I would not recommend this to someone I don't like. Also very small. The waiter took our food when we were not done. The staff was rude and seemed like they had other stuff to attend to. My advice eat at McDonald's. .at least there not rude.,1
"Lazy's Joe's was absolutely fantastic! Before visiting Vegas I researched what restaurants were gluten free and Celiac safe, so we tried this place. They're educated and genuinely concerned about gf food and safety against cross contamination. It was so amazing to delicious and safe food! So much love for you guys ",2
"Came in for some Magic Hat 9s upon arrival in Phoenix and it was a great first stop! We also ordered the Delux Mini Turkey Burgers with Sweet Potato Fries. The burgers were thick, juicy and supremely savory and the fries were crunchy and mouth watering. The meal paired so well with our beers too. We didn't want it to end! I will definitely be back!",2
"This is the slowest Starbucks I have ever been to. Third in line and it took 30 minutes to order and get my drinks. Part of the problem was some rookie ordering stupid drinks and part of the problem was the guy working the register was new. They have way to much employee turnover here, you have to wonder what is going on.",1
This is the type of place that makes you feel like a thousand bucks without actually spending it. The happy hour menu has sushi! I mean what more can you ask for in life? Bartender was awesome! Super trendy spot with good music such a chill vibe. The original cocktails are a must! You won't regret skipping the beer.,2
"Just got back from a quick dinner here. I'm from down South and way West, and I hadn't had a good torta in years. I needed this place. The sandwiches were delicious, the bread is just perfect. With an aqua fresca and soup trio it was an excellent meal and great value. One of the better budget eats around mile end.",2
"If you plan to go get some food in Lawrenceville at any other place besides Kaleidoscope, don't! Kaleidoscope is the place to go. It's hidden a few streets down from Butler and is such a gem. They offer generous portions for reasonable prices. The staff is welcoming and wonderful. Definitely one of my favorite places!",2
"I can't believe the positive reviews listed here. The food is marginal, not authentic. The quality of the ingredients is poor to fair. The only saving grace is the low prices. The ambiance is non existent. So, if you want belly filling Chinese and are desperate, than go for it. I restrict myself to take out, when I'm sick of pizza and fried chicken.",1
"Booked 3 nights and couldn't even check in. Line was 2 hrs long for an entire day. About 15 terminals available at lobby and only 4 employees checking people in. Utterly ridiculous Customer service. If you like to gamble go right ahead, you might win the jackpot and get to your room within 20 minutes upon arrival. If your key works.",1
"It's rare I have an experience that is actually criminal, but here you go. General shiftiness aside, I asked for a pour of makers mark. They poured from a makers mark bottle, but whatever was inside wasn't makers mark. That's right. They're stepping on even their low mid shelf stuff with rot gut. Despicable.",1
"I had high expectations after hearing so much about this place. It was ok. Everything tastes the same. A lot of items with bulgogi. I would like to have seen more variety. Pork belly tacos were nothing special nachos were ok, order the small large is huge and eating too much of it is a little overwhelming. I was expecting more.",1
"I never choose this place but end up here a couple times a year because this is where people want to go for whatever reason . It's always disappointing. After reading some of the reviews I can see it's not just me. Two repeat offenses. 1 reservations that are meaningless because they either overseat or over reserve, and 2 mediocre food service. Not worth it. Too bad Kennedy's closed.",1
They should really change the time that they open. Everytime I've gone 10am we've had to wait for them to open the door at least 10 20 minutes . They were still setting up inside and some of the yogurt wasn't ready. Hopefully they've fixed this problem because I haven't been back since then. This happened at least 3 times at this location.,1
"During the morning this club is paradise. They have amazing DJs and great table and cabana services. The day clubs have a open layout. However, the pools are warm. Despite the temperate of the pool, I always have a fun time! During the night the club is so crowded. By the end of the night they start to shut down parts of the club slowly and gradually by the end of night it becomes so crowded.",2
"Very unprofessional when a restaurant calls you 3 weeks after you book a reservation for 6 people, and tells you they are not honoring the reservatioow because someone wants to rent the entire restaurant that same evening I hope everyone else who was cancelled by this place tells all their friends and colleagues to avoid this place very short sighted.",1
Dr. Melander was very professional and friendly. I was a bit nervous trying out a new Dentist but within a few minutes I was very comfortable and relaxed. He took time and explained everything he was doing. His assistant Monica was a very attentive with a great personality. I would highly recommend Emamor Dentistry.,2
"I really enjoyed the food, the service and the atmosphere here. My mom and I ate here for restaurant week and its was delicious. The blackened brie is a definite winner as is the decadent hot chocolate dessert. All the staff were very attentive and I also liked how the managers showed an involvement in the restaurant which is something you do not see all the time. Will defintely be going back.",2
"Awful service, the laziest hostess servers I've ever seen, save your money folks as this place is a big overpriced joke! The stoner hostess was at least a little funny as she stared off into space while I complained, these places know that they can get away with poor service because of the constant flow of new people, I'll never stay at Caesars again because nof this shitty tourist trap",1
"I have had several people tell me the quality of the dancers is nothing to brag about. Ballerinas struggling with more than one pirouette on pointe, choreography that does not match the music, sloppy technique. After seeing ""The Nutcracker "" at the Smith Center I would have to agree with all of the above. The dancers really need some discipline and lots more practice!",1
"I used to really like their turkey panini for some reason. Simple. Perfect. Right amount of turkey and cheese and pesto aioli, at the right temperature with the right crunchiness. But now it's served cold on a ciabatta bun, and it tastes like every other boring, overpriced cold turkey sandwich with too much turkey and bland, dry bread. Meh.",1
This is the best place to grab a sandwich after a tough workout. This place is fast too so you don't have to wait around like you would at a subway. Much better quality ingredients too. Try the Vito and the Beach club. I've never had any complaints about the workers and they always seemed friendly to me and greet me on my way in and out. I will be back for more subs.,2
Very pleased with our recent stay here. The room was comfortable and affordable. It featured a huge tub and everything had a modern look to it. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. The location made it quick and convenient to get off the strip. We even squeezed in a show and ate here as well. We received discounts on both due to staying in the hotel. We will definitely be coming back.,2
"By far the best buffet in Vegas, hands down, no questions asked. nBy far the best looking buffet, hands down, no questions asked. nBy far the best food selection, hands down, no questions asked. Do you really need any more convincing? Words caot describe The Buffet at the Wynn. Let your taste buds do the talking.",2
"Stopped by this place based on Yelp reviews. I'm glad I did. This store has great statement pieces lamps, rugs, chairs to add to your home. Plus, any furniture they carry is great for apartment or condo living not oversized sectionals and massive chests . There is also a section with unique gifts and funny cards. Street parking can be a little tricky.",2
"Just a Horrible experience from start to finish nyou have to take a 15 min ride from airport to the rental center nLine was an hr. there is a 22 dollar up charge for insurance nGetting the car is another line the disorganization is disastrous nAnd when i wanted to return 12 hrs ahead of time i was charged an extra 40 dollars nPlease take my advice, pay more do what you have to DO NOT USE FOX's",1
"The owner contacted my husband a few days later and was shocked to hear of our experience and offered a free lunch. However, I find it hard to believe he was shocked of this experience considering all the negative posts on Yelp! There are many other Mexican food restaurants in this town to with better food, excellent service and at a great value!",1
This little cafe is like a hidden gem. Everything here is out of this world yummy! I got the chicken pesto wrap sandwich in a wrap and a side of the pesto pasta salad and it was so delicious. I've also had the club sandwich and that was good too. I'm definitely a fan. Just wished it was open longer hours.,2
"Came in after a wedding with 4 other exhausted friends. After over 30 minutes, we're all served profoundly undercooked chicken blood pools in the middle of all pieces . The server apologized and took our new order. We left a half hour later after not being served. The server never returned. There were only two other patrons.",1
"Of my favorite Mexican style Restaurants. You line up and direct them how you want your meal prepared. The food is fresh. The place is clean. The menu is simple, yet enough choices to find what is right for you. I use my Zaba's reward card, after so many meals, then you get a free meal. I frequent this place often.",2
"Superb Mughal classics, served with great style in a gentle and relaxing atmosphere. Great wine list, too, which Indian restaurants often lack. Prices are higher than most neighborhood curry houses, but the quality of the ingredients is definitely worth the splurge if you truly love this cuisine. A great place!",2
"I am disgusted that I succumbed to eating here, but I was starving and there was no place for me to grab food until I landed in Austin. Unfortunately, Sbarro happened to be the first restaurant that I saw after I landed in Charlotte. I ordered a slice of pizza, a spinach roll, and a water. I left 16 poorer and queasy. P.S. staff is rude.",1
"The place is cool, very hipster. Outdoor and indoor seating with a larger and more descriptive beer menu indoors. Four of us sat down ecstatic about their 6 , 6 oz samplers. Unfortunately of the 18 different flavors we chose, collectively we only enjoyed 2. Really wanted to like this place.It was extremely disappointing.",1
"Holy Cow! Have you tried the Pizzas? If you havent, you're doing yourself a GREAT disservice! The pizzas and food in this establishment are amazing the 4 Queens location too . The Service here is attentive, but the service at the other location inside the 4 Queens is the opposite. You need a neon sign around your neck saying ""Help me "" over there!",2
So went to this place for the second time during Sunday brunch. I must say their food was really good during brunch. The wait is pretty long so come early. The staff was friendly and service was on point. The Jamaican jerk chicken and waffles were tasty. The best was their chilaquiles super flavor flavorful and delicious. Bottomless mimosas can't go wrong,2
"Honestly, I've had better Mexican food, but the outside patio and dining room is so beautifully decorated, I always make sure to bring out of state guests here. The waitstaff has always been friendly and the food is served quick and piping hot. The wait for a table during snow bird season can be awfully long so be prepared.",2
"I love this place! The fish tacos are to die for, the bean dip is flavorful, and the drinks are delicious especially the dark and stormy. This is the place I go to when there's some sort of special occasion since it's a little pricy. I would give this place 5 stars, but the server I've had a couple of times is just really unfriendly and odd.",2
"Met some friends for lunch today at Local Bistro and was blown away by the NIcoise Salad with ahi. It was wonderful and there is no skimping on the ""good bits "". Lots of capers and olives and the ahi was absolutely delicious. My husband has a seafood salad and was every bit as pleased with his meal. So glad this is close to home! Wonderful service and a nice atmosphere a real winner.",2
"Great little jazz club! I can't wait until they have their liquor license, but until then you can BYOB. 5 to cork wine, and 1 per beer bottle so it's an added charge, but worth it. The jazz guys here are amazing, and its 10 a person, 5 for students. Keep that ASU card forever, ladies and gentlemen! This place is worth it.",2
Stopped here for a lunch combo today Saturday 1pm and was told they didn't have the lunch combo today. No reason was given for not serving the combo today. Posters all over the store state Lunch Combo pizza plus drink for 5 EVERY day between 11 am and 2 pm. Tried to then get a pretzel crust pizza they didn't have that either. I went home and made myself a sandwich!,1
"Got my hair done by Tara the other day. Great experience! I told her I wanted highlights, but natural looking and low maintenance. She suggested we do some partial highlights on the second layer of my hair so the new growth wouldn't be so obvious. The cut was nice just a layer trim . The salon itself is trendy, clean, and I absolutely LOVE the music. I've found my new hair spot in Vegas ",2
"Always a great meal! Tried the Lady is a Scampi pasta dish on this occasion. Pretty good. Nice kick of spicy. Our hands down favorite is the Big Rig. Always enough food to split to save room for a Pazookie aka pizza cookie However, this time it was a little over cooked and they skimped on the cookie dough. Probably why it was over done. Still yummy though!",2
"Menu looks awesome! Tuesdays there is 5 wines and kids eat free. Has a funky smell, but it's minor and the place is old. Parking in front is tricky, but plenty of parking in the back. Menu is great for large crowds and plenty of seating throughout. Salmon wrap was just okay, but black and blue burger was amazing! Kinda divey, but I like it. Seat yourself.",2
Amazing! Jackie never ever let's me down. Ive eaten hear at least 50 times and it is always excellent. I east sushi all over the country and this is some of the best I've found stateside. Tip ask for a spicy smoked salmon skin hand roll. I eat two to three each time. Don't bring a large group but do bring patience as they are busy EVERY day during lunch and dinner. Worth the wait!,2
"This place is GREAT! My son has had many play dates here. It is so nice to sit back and relax while he plays. The Cafe has very tasty food. Not to mention my son has an absolute blast when we go there. The employees are very nice and helpful. The owner is great. This is a great place to play, especially in the hot summer heat!",2
"The place has a nice vibe, the food well not so good! Portions are very small. Prices are high. I mean come on its pasta, put a little in the plate! If you want a great authentic Italian meal, Montisanos in Eastern. Not fancy, but also not expensive. Great service and most importantly, great food and pizza. You wont leave hungry.",1
"Bring a nose plug. They have every high end store you could ever want to shop in, but this mall STINKS. It literaly has a stench. It is a failed attempt at piping in an appealing scent. It is so gross. I almost puked the last time i had to walk through the damn place to get to Aria. Next time I will most likely not stay at Aria and avoid this place like the plague. I'm gagging thinking about it.",1
"Food was pretty good, but our server Leila was what made our experience worth it, she was great and resourceful about the menu, because my husband and I did not know anything about the place and she was so helpful with the lobster. If you can get over the smell and the heads on the food, you'll love it!",2
"Not impressed with this shop at all. Their product offering is sub par and customer service is awful. The only reason why we stopped by here is because we were referred by an employee from another SuperPawn.she said that they had a nice selection of silver jewelry, which was a lie. The silver jewelry selection here was minimal. Return Factor 5 ",1
This place used to have great food now it's just fair. It takes too long to order and the staff is rude. Employees look like they hate being there. Starting to look dirty and always out of cups or napkins. This used to be my favorite place so I hope they read their reviews and turn the place around!,1
"Extremely friendly staff with lots of seating. We had a party of six hungry, thirsty, and craving Sushi at 7pm on a Friday night. Called to make reservations, 15 minutes later we were sitting down each with a large bottle of Asahi and Sake. The fish was fresh and the rolls were creative and filling. The staff was both knowledgeable and provided great service with a smile.",2
"Another NODA disappointment. Came here last night with a friend for a drink. It was Easter Sunday and nothing was open so I headed over to NODA. It took light years for the owner bartender to serve us and when he did, they were out of the reds I wanted. Friend was mortified by the house white. I'm keeping my butt Uptown 'til NODA business owners get some class.",1
"Met friends here last night for restaurant week. The food was fantastic and the variety offered was a great value. They even included wine or sake. The lobster rolls were very good. nThe only negative I found was the waiter had no idea what was on the restaurant week menu or how the whole deal worked. Once he figured it out, he did a nice job. nAmazing amount of food and drink for 30.",2
"Terrible bar service! The place was trashed, and they charged my card 3 times not once. I had overdraft fees they refused to pay, and never apologized. Bar manager said she didnt even close out my tab but gave it to another worker. Thats the only explanation i got. I will never visit again. Horrible service, and worse ownership.",1
"Poliberto's n43rd Glendale nCost 1 nService 1 of 5, DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE WE GOT A BURRITO instead of a taco! nPresentation 3 of 5 nTaste 1 of 5, ""not that great "" DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE WE GOT A BURRITO! Seriously? nIn a taste test of 7 local taco shops, you failed to actually give us a taco the first time, and the tester wouldn't even eat the whole thing.",1
"I have heard so many good things about this place I had to try it. What a disappointment. Long lines. Expensive deserts. And the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate was horrible. So not worth it. For 1 4 of the price, get a shake at In N Out instead. Way better. I do not get what the hype is all about. Not going back.",1
"The best kept locals secret in NLV! Stopped in for the first time about two weeks ago. Why write the review now? Because I am STILL thinking about that pulled pork sandwich with mac n cheese. AMAZING! If you would have asked me before my rendezvous with SNS, I would have told you that me and pulled pork don't mix, apparently because I had never had it done right until these guys. MUST TRY!",2
"I have given this burger king a chance MANY times. But they are BY FAR the slowest burger king I have EVER been to. Even if they have no customers inside, and you go through the empty drive through, they will STILL make you pull forward and wait for your meal, one time it was over a half hour! Absolutely unreasonable.",1
"Poor service repeated my order three times and it was still wrong , loud music probably the reason the girl could not hear me and got the order wrong , wrong change even after I pointed it out, they did not correct it, the cashier walked away , no selection no pastrami, no swiss, cheddar, only provolone, etc . Why would anyone want to eat here?",1
"I love this place . we were having alot of trouble finding an invatatioin company to work with for our wedding, mostly because we had a concept in mind that was not a typical invitation. They worked with us, and had it all ready to mail out within 4 weeks. It was awesome. Our invitations came out perfect, and Kristin did some graphic design for us as well as create our emblem. They were fantastic!",2
"We eat here about once a month and have always had great food and service. I have noticed how the food is always much better if you eat in, I wonder if some of the bad reviews were a result of food sitting. We always get the sweet and sour chicken and kung pao chicken and have always enjoyed it. have eaten there about 20 times never had rude service or gotten ill.",2
"The menu at Badger is simple and basic, the way bar food should be. And the prices are cheap to! So add those two combined with a build your own burger and you have a recipe for success in my book. My friends and I regularly visit this fine establishment a few times a month and the food nor the service has failed us yet. Extra points for the dive bar atmosphere!",2
"I'm not sure if the owner manager was trying to create a bustling NYC type atmosphere when I was there or what. but it didn't work. He just came off rude and I didn't like it. The slices were pretty good they have cheap wings, but there are too many other businesses and life is too short to wait around for pushy pizza.",1
We've taken our pets to Fitchburg Veterinary for years. My dog has a lot of anxiety and fear when going to the vet from a different vet and Dr. Lukas and all the staff there always understanding and try to put him at ease. We are always able to get in for an appointment quickly and the staff there is friendly and helpful.,2
"Food was overpriced and mediocre at best. Service was horrid. We were greeted by one, order was taken by our main server, and food was served by yet another. That and our actual server came back one time to ask if we needed anything, deemed our request unimportant and proceeded to never come back, but instead talked to the table behind us the whole time. Won't be coming back.",1
This show exceeds all expectations. My husband and I were both blown away. The choreography and visual effects are super. I was teary eyed several times throughout the performance as it was so mind blowing and MJ was truly one of a kind. I recommend this to anyone who likes music. It is an uplifting show and a must see!,2
"What a find! We were stopped by the security guard asking us to bag our beers. He was very polite so we decided to go in. We've now eaten there 3 days in a row! Not only is the food cheap, but it tastes great! Everything we try new we like better. And the ""flip the sauce "" flair is a fun bit to watch. Makes this end of the strip worth a visit.",2
"I do enjoy Sauce. The Pizzas are great, not the best around but they are good. This place is a bit pricey for what it is but still worth it. The Panninis are great and always hit the spot. They give you actual glasses for your soda and have to ask for a to go cup, which is kinda annoying, but thats just a small issue.",2
"OK. This location is actually new. A few months . The other location further UP S. BLVD closed to open THIS location. SAME ol faces and a few new ones. nIts located on the RIGHT side heading South at the same light you wld use to turn for TARGET, AMC, ETC. Discount Tires shares the same parking lot, so if Traffic is backed up. Turn into the D.T. lot and drive around. Cheers",2
"My experience in Phoenix was totally different than other reviewers. My impression is that FireFly management at Phoenix read the reviews and took them to heart. There was no line, there was no bait and switch on the car class, there was no demand to take the full tank fuel option, the car was a 2013 Honda Civic with 11,000 miles on it. I would rent from them any time in Phoenix.",2
This place is chill. We like to come here to chill. nService is great they always have suggestions for patrons. nThe atmosphere is cozy and eclectic. The artwork ranges from interesting to what the hell is that? nThere are some nights where there is live music I wouldn't suggest comig here to chit chat on those nights. Come for the music.,2
went here with a group from work and it was okay. the kobe sliders could have been better. i also had the crab stuffed shrimp and it was too salty. one really bad thing was the beer.the house beer i wanted was not available for what it felt like 30 mins as they were changing the tap. that was silly.i had to settle for another beer.,1
"I really like this place! It almost looks closed most of the time because when you're walking right past it, it's dark and hard to see in unless you get really close. The last time we've been was Valentine's Day 2011. I'm sure we'll be going back really soon, but it just hasn't crossed our minds. It's a nice place for a date that's for sure. Their soup is also really good.",2
The Walgreens I've always dreamed of. Lol. Ever since They did a remodel this place is excellent! It's the Costco of Walgreens. There are aisles upon aisles of stuff and they're open 24 seven. Fresh food brought in daily like at QT. Photo products also 24 7. Friendly staff and Super clean store. During regular hours there is also a take care clinic. Nice!,2
"Excellent fresh meals tasty ingredients. Great variety on the menu . We've had the quiche twice and both times, delicious! Great coffee and teas, hot or iced full coffee bar. Nice decor, comfortable feel to the dining room. Nice patio too for cooler weather staff are helpful and take good care of you during your visit.",2
"OVERPRICED! I had 4 dresses from white house black market dry cleaned and they charged me 20 dress. The price on their website listed dresses as 10.75, but what they failed to mention is that they were probably talking about kid cotton dresses. It took a week to get the dresses back. For the quality and time, it is definitely not worth the price.",1
Woke up at 4am by next door people talking and we could also hear the music from the nightclub. Very noisy hotel. nThey charge you for wifi access ! You are allowed only one device and have to connect only from the room otherwise they charge. around 25 per device per 24h . Of course they don't tell you that! nLots of same price range hotels to stay in LV so I will pick another one next time,1
"There isn't much to write about the Great Greek. It is a fast food type restaurant that serves delicious Greek food that tastes home made. The Gyro, Grilled Chicken Souvlaki, Grilled Garlic Shrimp and Avgolemono Soup are all surprisingly delicious. If you are in the mood for a wholesome tasting Greek meal, you would do well to give this place a try. You won't be disappointed.",2
"I love that it's 24 hours, I come here every time that I'm in Vegas and staying at the Tuscany it's so convenient, the only thing I would say is to speed up the take out orders I waited for like 40mins at 1 30am for my food but other than that it was worth the wait. Oh yeah and there is plenty of food options and the price is amazing with good quality food.",2
Excellent spot gets busy quickly so get there early. The staff is very friendly and the food is great and made fresh and delivered to the table fast. Had the California eggs benedict with house made hollandaise and it was very tasty. Prices are very reasonable and breakfast for two came out to 26.00. The breakfast joynt also has great patio seating with misters.,2
"They are under construction so it's a little confusing, especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper but as my husband commented, maybe the cookies are REALLY good . Anyway I wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice! And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.",2
"We went to Laziza after work for happy hour and it was disappointing, we ordered most of the appetizers, some drinks and a hookah. Of all the appetizers the hummus was the best but everything else was just bland. The service was ok when we actually saw our waiter. For a Hookah lounge I was expecting something a little more intimate and comfortable. I won't be going back to this place again.",1
"This place is totally amazing. My dad brought me here when I was about 10, and I remember being amazed by the concept of screenprinting. It's one of the major factors that contributed to me wanting to go to art school, which I did, and then learn to screenprint myself. It's such a fun museum, and I'd love love love to go back!",2
"One of the few reasons I may miss Pittsburgh when I go to grad school. The hot dogs are piled on high with the best, fattiest stuff I can muster up, and the beer selection is one of the best in Allegheny Co. Great for a night out with friends, followed by indie movies at the Regent Square Theatre across the street.",2
Every week I have an administrative staff meeting. My turn to pick the location and this one was my fault. Service was OK at first but our server soon lost interest in our table. The food was bland resembling microwave frozen food. No one was impressed. Still looking for a good Mexican place in the Vegas valley,1
"Just like everyone else said, it is okay. The chicken Alfredo was decent. The menu said the sauce was homemade and it didn't taste like it. The lasagna was decent. The tomato sauce tasted like it came out of a can. Our waitress left us numerous times to talk to a guy outside the restaurant. This wasn't not a great 1st impression an I will never go back again.",1
The owner is extremely rude and yelled at my wife and kids as they were leaving Goldie's next door saying they were being too loud. I've seen him him complain several other times about kids being in that shopping center. I will never eat at Voila because of the owner's poor behavior and the way he treated my wife and kids.,1
"This hotel is stuck in the 80's in terms of their meeting spaces. Bad lighting that is annoying, bright and dull at the same time. Bathrooms are clean. Fresh paint and carpets, plus updated lighting needed badly in the ballrooms. In a nutshell? This place feels like the kind of hotel you can smoke inside of still just dingy, despite minor attempts to update it with new furniture in the lobby.",1
"BJ's has some great beer, and the food is not bad either. I know it's a chain, but it does exceedingly well for a chain. Probably one of the best out there. The Jerimiah Red beer is excellent, as well as the Piranah something or other. If you go, try their thin crust appetizer pizza. But try it as a meal. It should be more than enough. If not, you can then fill up on beer.",2
I walked in just got looked at like I wasn't suppose to walk in. I was looking at the lipsticks with every intention to buy but no one bothered to ask me if I needed any help after standing there for 3 minutes. I definitely could afford pretty much anything in this store but because of my skin color they probably thought otherwise because that's the vibe I got. Won't be back here again!,1
"So happy I finally discovered this place! So far I've only had the Chicken Kale salad the closest tasting to True Food Kitchen's Tuscan Kale so far and the chicken pesto sandwich with the potato salad. n My in laws had a corn beef brisket and the scrambled egg, feta and tomato sandwich. They loved it also! Will be back many times!",2
"Don't order the sourdough cheeseburger special. It is all bread and will have you screaming ""where's the beef "". Their beer is pretty expensive and the service was slow. I wish I had something better to say, but it is what it is. My friends ordered sliders and they looked really good. Maybe I made bad choices.",1
We were looking for somewhere to eat before Zumanity. We called Chin Chin and made reservations a few hours before just to be on the safe side. When we arrived there was a small line but we got right in. Service was a little slow and the food was just plain blah. I am shocked that people recommend this place and use the word superb in their reviews.,1
"These people dont even deserve a damn star. I called a cab at 12 00 in the afternoon. They said it would arrive around 40minutes. An hr past i called them. The guy answered and said i dont know. i cant tell u where the cab is. Another hr passes. i say fuck it and started walking. Bullshit, ghetto ass company.",1
"As a customer for several years, I have had the enjoyment and relaxation from this facility. Consistently the massage therapist are knowledgeable and show compassion and etiquette for my needs. Great price and very convenient to schedule. I will continue to use this location for my regular massages!",2
"I received flowers on 1 21 14. Can I just say that these are the most beautiful, fragrant flowers I have ever received?! And, the next best part is that as of this morning, the roses have just now given out, but the pink lilies are still so beautiful. Again, the most amazingly beautiful bouquet I've ever been given.",2
"Noodle soup, served piping hot with fresh condiments, like cilantro, basil, and bean sprouts. Good for cold winter night, or when I crave a good pho. It's the big bowl with plenty of broth, vegetable, meat and noddle, which is a bit fat, almost like spaghetti noodle, but is good. Here the service is quick, attentive despite how busy this place is.",2
"Your receipt will say it all. "" 3 Car bomb.F YEAH "". I dont even like carbombs but I tend to do atleast one EVERYTIME I go there. Also Wednesdays is 3 Guinness day. not gonna be able to beat that anywhere. nThe food is so yummy, but if you are in a hurry, this may not be the place for you. nAnd the owner, gooood lord! I have the biggest crush, the things I would let that man do to me.",2
"SCAM! Price more than doubled from estimate over the phone. DO NOT USE! After waiting nearly 40 minutes outside with two small children the ""locksmith "" arrived no company car he couldn't even tell me the name of the company! he said he was just a contractor working for several companies . Well, we paid 100 for one deadbolt lock to be removed! RUN from these guys!",1
"I hope I experienced this place on a bad day. based on what we had on this day I would not go back. the food was dry and tasteless. Maybe it's better if you eat in, we got takeout, and our house is only 5 minutes away. I can't recommend it at all, based on the food we had. I really wanted it to be good, too!",1
"Delicious huge slices for affordable prices, the combo is a great deal. Very friendly service, 6 bucks for 2 slices and a drink lunch special, tasty pizza was just what I needed to put in my belly. It was fresh out the oven, cooked to perfection and very flavorful. If you want real wood fire brick oven pizza check out this place right behind the strip!",2
"Smelly nLoud nPretentious for no good reason at all nOverpriced But the worst thing for someone like me, as a vegetarian, is that there are perhaps two items on the entire menu from which to choose. I don't mind macguyvering a meal out of the appetizer section, but come on! All you have is tofu or edamame? No thanks.",1
"Dear Catastrophe Waitress, It's not okay to push people out I your way or sneer at your customers. We can't help it that the airport is busy and that you are poorly managed. You shouldn't take your anger out on the very people on who you depend for you livelihood. It's too bad you blew us off. We are nice people and good tippers. Happy Thanksgiving.",1
"Love the vibe and the small plates and dessert, not to mention the wine! Generous pour of great tasting wines and the Mezza plate hummus, feta dip, and olives and raspberry creme br u00fbl u00e9e cheesecake were all delicious! Definitely plan to try the bruschetta and a cheese plate next time. Highly recommended.",2
"The employees at this location are RUDE! They are so miserable. They don't even call out your name when your drink is ready. I tried to use my free birthday drink coupon and the girl got bitchy and was like ""we aren't a real Starbucks so we don't take those. "" Well clearly. I would be disturbed if you were a ""real "" Starbucks. nPass this fake ass place and go to a ""real "" Sbux.",1
"Terrible Service. I have to constantly fight and argue with those people. Bill, the Vice Presiden is nothing short of a liar and a bigot in my opinion. I had many email conversations with him where he promises he would address it and later on does nothing about it. Lates is telling me I do not understand the English language due to me having an accent. This company needs to be out of business.",1
My sister went back after I was contacted by someone from the bakery due to my original review. Apparently I'm not the only one who had complaints about this particular employee who is no longer working there . My sister's second experience was completely different and so much better! She is so happy to be getting exactly what she wants and I can't wait to taste the final product.,2
"I mean, how many stars can you really give a laundromat? This place smells like mildew constantly. Like, since I've been going, it's never NOT smelled like mildew. I'd like to think that a place you go to clean things.should be clean? Guess not. Anyway, the people who work here are courteous and nice, if that matters.",1
"Absolutely TERRIBLE! Hands down the worst massage I have every had. They have no clue what they are doing! I left after 20 minutes it was that bad. Even just that 20 minutes did more harm than good, I feel ten times worse now then before I went in there yesterday. If you would rather be further injured than this is the place, otherwise STAY AWAY! I I could give them less than one star I would.",1
"Food was amazing. The terrace with the fountains made for a very unique dining experience, but indoor would have been more romantic for us. Service was on par for a restaurant of this level. Cost was less than what I expected for a restaurant of this level. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone in Las Vegas.",2
"Wanted to eat at a fancy place, but no time on a Saturday night. Was disappointing to end up here with mediocre food and service. We were warned about karaoke night, but the singers were ok, so it was tolerable. Good place for lunch maybe, but not on a date. At least not inside. Maybe on a cooler night on the patio.",1
"If you are looking for a quaint and scenic place to eat, this is perfect! Located at The Farm at South Mountain along with 2 other dining options The Farm Kitchen and Quiessence It was a lovely experience. The food is good, service was good it's worth a trip. The offer mimosas and bloody mary's too. They have a private table in back for romantic setting too, you have to call an reserve it.",2
"Every Trader Joes is awesome in my opinion, and this TJ in Eastern is no exception. I shop here at least once a week, if not more, and the experience is always A . Staff is fantastic, friendly, knowledgable, helpful and the store is always clean and well stocked. I like they have a good selection of organic and preservative free foods at fair prices.",2
"I have been going here for a few months now, and already I'm in much better physical condition, and I'm becoming a better fighter. What I love is that there are no contracts, you get to pay monthly at very reasonable prices and your first class is free, so come join us and be part of the BCF family!",2
"Gluttony in its best form. HUGE portions even for Oklahoma standards, lol . I mean I ate for 30 minutes and it looked like I hadn't touched it. It's definitely good, but I'm pretty sure I'll be sharing next time! I had the chicken and waffles and the husband had a skillet of some sort. Both were great! Bloody Mary's are enormous and can be taken to go! Win!",2
"A restaurant unusual, everything is OK, the kitchen, the service and the atmosphere of a delicacy irreproachable, ravioli has hmmmm Truffle. N Let no dessert. We went to enter Friends, c was very nice. A The recommader, If you are in Chicago, he absolutely Made a visit, you will not be disappointed, c is very original",2
"Horrible customer service. Asked for help and was told to go wait in a line. next, That girl couldn't find the item that was kept behind counter. Didn't want to spend time on me because of people behind me. Other customer asked if she could call for backup. Manager standing around said in a minute. Continued doing nothing. I won't return to this location.",1
"I have been a patient with this office since 2006. Everyone is always so pleasant and caring. Recently, I was a participant in an event for children from broken homes. I told this office about the event, and they donated hygiene kits for all of the children. They were all so excited! Thank you so much! I will see you in March for my next appointment!",2
"This place is amazing! And yes, it is better than Ramen Monta, which we had just the day before. nHub hub had the vengeance broth is the spiciest ramen we have ever had but quite good. nI had the miso and it was perfection. The broth is creamy, rich and very robust in flavor and the noodles here are just the best! We will be back for sure!",2
I love this place I have taken my car there three times. They always make sure I have a ride home if they have to keep my car give me updates on what they have to do. My car is a used one and it has had to have a lot of work on it but I feel save in it now that they have work on it. It a peace of mind to feel driving!,2
"I ate here with a coworker from New York. He said it is so close to New York pizza it's unbelievable. We have a large cheese. Which was more like a extra extra large cheese due to must restaurant standards. It was good, greasy. Reminded me of the pizza they use to serve in grade school. I won't mind eatting here again. Just not something I would write home about.",2
Christmas party at Greekfest. I had the steak and my wife had the salmon. I suppose it is possible that they were having a bad night but everything seemed nearly flavorless. None of it was good. The desert was about the only thing worth having. The atmosphere was great and the staff was helpful but they need to rework the kitchen if they want to stay in business.,1
Went in to check on the sizes of a storage unit and the lady was super helpful. Really nice and accommodating and really tried to make it very convenient for me as far as location. Explained all of the charges and benefits and even suggested their promotion that I was unaware of. Super easy and very happy to be working with them.,2
"A quiet little coffee shop above the street. It's location would make it a good place to while away some time if ieed of a break, and the coffee was acceptably good. However, when I visited on a Friday morn, I found the wifi was non functional. One waitress clearly couldn't handle the task of making a breakfast sandwich and getting the advertised free wifi up and running.",1
"This is FREE, convenient, fast, and crowded expect a wait, but it's not too bad on the weekends. We usually take this tram at least once or twice a year when we walk The Strip . Despite the crowd of tourists, it's very clean and free of debris. Usually, it's crowded so you just grab a bar and hang on tight. The ride is really fast, and POOF! you're already there.",2
I am currently sitting in this chair after waiting for 45 minutes. Nothing done to speed things up. Everyone seems to love socializing and not actually getting people in and out with their lives. Probably worst eye doctor visit ever and it hasnt even technically started. Avoid this place unless you enjoy waiting and waiting and waiting.,1
"Vanessa is right in a previous post. One of the best parts of this gym was the area that is now roped off for personal training. I do not have a problem with personal trainers having priority, but to disallow members to use that area is bad business. The trainers rarely use it. I will update my post if the area goes back to the way it should be.",1
"The place reminds me a lot of my freshman dorm. Peeling walls, fluorescent lighting flickering in the elevator and strange humid smells. Although my bed and bathroom were pretty clean, and the staff were really great, the hotel itself is pretty old and resembles a trucker motel. Way overpriced for what it is.",1
"Avoid like the plague! Terrible people rip off scam, they sign you up after a Groupon offering great value, carry on charging you when your not even in the country, I have since left the US and explained my situation to the Manager who then decides to send a conned contract to a debt collection agency. AVOID DO NOT deal with this company!",1
Server was the best part of this place she had great customer service. The cups our waters came is were dirty with food particles. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese but they only gave me scrambled eggs. The kitchen claimed it had cheese but it didn't. Kitchen staff was rude yelling out loud about it.,1
"Yandy is a fabulous company for ordering lingerie. I was extremely satisfied with all the products I ordered, their cost and how fast I received the shipment. There was one item that did not meet my satisfaction and I contacted the company. They responded in a matter of hours and the issue was resolved to my satisfaction immediately. Going forward I will always order my products from this company.",2
"Amazing food! Choose basically anything and it will be awesome! Favorites included the Eggplant, Black Pepper Beef, Soup dumplings, well really any and all of the dumplings. Just close your eyes and point, it will be good, and authentic, if that's not what your after you can still find something that you'll like, but really it's the authenticity of flavored that shine.",2
Overall Best Denny's I have been to in Las Vegas nDetails n The food quality has been consistently good during the 1 2 dozen times I have eaten here. n My 2 1 2 yr old daughter LOVES the mac'n cheese here and my wife and I actually get to enjoy our meal because she enjoys hers. n Great Denny's value with military discount,2
"Best BBQ ever. Love it all. I follow him around the city to get his food. I have tried the pulled pork and the brisket and they both blew me away. My 4yr old daughter is picky about what she eats, but she immediately fell in love with the brisket and wants it every time we see him. The food is so good i always finish it in the car before i get home.",2
"4 stars to start, only because I've only been there once. If future visits remain consistently good, I'll up it! The banana cream pie pancakes were amazing! I also had a taste of the red velvet pancakes, which were just as good. This place also knows how to make some of the best bacon ever! Praise bacon!",2
I decided to try Sports Clips this week as I am tired of receiving mediocre haircuts for 35 or more. I am now a big fan. Ashley did a great job on my hair and I am very happy with the result. On top of that she is actually happy to be working here and her positive attitude carriers over into her customer's experience. If you are tired of over paying for your haircut give this place a try.,2
"First time here for a party off 2 after passing many times on mill. We were seated outside, given our menus and that was it. We waited 15 minutes and still not even water. We left, made sure the manager knew. They offered a free meal, but it's not fun eating your food when you know the restaurant knows they messed up.",1
"V Transportation is a terrible, scamming, potentially trip ruining, rude, unaccomodating, worthless, cheap, lying, no good, rotten, low life, dirt eating, slime ball, inbred, overstuffed, ignorant, blood sucking, dog kissing, brainless, sackless, hopeless, heartless, fat assed, bug eyed, moronic, worm headed, sack of monkey pooped son of a motherless goated company.

"We were in Vegas for my husband's birthday in January and we surprised him with dinner reservations at Benihaha. It was a great experience. The show was fun, people sitting around us were a blast, and the drinks were great pours! Wow, I was happy after 1 ""Buddah "". As always, the food was excellent. We weren't thinking about the price because it was a special occasion.",2
Came on a Friday mid day. We were seated right away and the server gave us plenty of time to decide. nThe pre meal bread was very yummy. The menu is very extensive and there was so much to choose from. My friend and I settled with the Asian Nachos. Very yummy! Definitely good to split. They were very rich. I would come back here. Decent prices for the strip and something for everyone.,2
"Some definite problems as a venue. There is smoking in the bar up front, which creates problems for people who want to watch the shows. The building is long and narrow, and the shows can be extremely crowded, with most of the audience standing. Often difficult to see the stage. Yes, this place has a lot of charm, but they could do a lot to improve the space as a performance venue.",1
"ALERT ! ALERT! Pho Bang is now Pho THanh. The only thing that I had here was Banh Mi. So far it is very good but it takes forever! There are too many waiters and not enough cook. I don't know if this is true anymore but waiter from this restaurant does not get tips, the owner takes it all. That's the price waiters here pay for getting paid under the table.",1
"Gyro Greek salad was quite large, tasty, not a great taste to the tzatziki, too much dill. What I appreciated most about the place, which happens to be a hole in the wall in a strip mall, was the customer service. Very friendly and cool peeps. I would definitely stop back when I happen to be in Phx.",2
"Compared to Korean food in other cities, the offerings in Champaign Urbana are quite dismal. Unfortunately, Woori Jib falls within this category. Sampling of the ""standard fare "" Bulgolgi, spicy tofu soup, mackerel, etc. revealed that is food is not seasoned well, much of the BBQ is rather fatty, and overall quite ""rough "" and unappealing in appearance.",1
"Amazing food for the price. I love the cucumber salad they start you off with. The bento box is also awesome. It's great if you want just a little bit of everything and at around 8, it was well worth every penny. Their sushi alone is also amazing. It feels more like a traditional Japanese restaurant compared to other restaurants in Champaign. I'll definitely be back!",2
"Went to San Tan Flats tonight. Has such an amazing ambiance! We sat at the bar and ordered drinks, appetizers and dinner. nThe medium rare burger we ordered for dinner came out well done. nWe spoke to Megan, the manager, and she absolutely corrected the situation. nIn all, this is great place with good service and fun atmosphere.",2
"If this is fish and chips, then I'm a monkeys uncle! They served some sort of RED sauce that i think had horseradish in it for your dipping sauce for the fish! What the hell is that. Fish and Chips get served with either Lemon and Tartare Sauce and Malt Vinegar for your Chips. Wont be going back there EVER!",1
"I live right around the corner from this place, and i was pleasantly surprised at the great tasting food and wonderful ambiance of this restaurant! I love the rad na, chicken tomato and yellow curry! Plus, service is always wonderful, and they are always happy to have you there. Great prices for a good amount of food, not to mention the Thai tea is BIG! Highly recommended.",2
"I love this Chick Fil A! There is a great selection of food assuming you like chicken and it is mostly healthy food, at least compared to other fast food. This is also a great place for kids, with a good selection of healthy food for kids and a play area. This is a go to place for us when we visit family in the Queen Creek area. I only wish there was a Chick Fil A in the Seattle area.",2
"This place is awesome! and would place it as one of the places I would visit if I was in the area. The steak burgers are a little thin, but pack big flavor. The fries are nice as well. The custard is outstanding and is a must after dinner meal. Service wise, the staff is extremely friendly and compariable to chik filets. If your in the area I would definitely make give this place a try.",2
"The place has some killer subs. I always get La Canna, it's the Italian and comes with a big juicy pickle, hold the blk olives plz. I feel uplifted somehow every time I go in there, maybe it's all the weed posters. Employees are SUPER SUPER friendly. Tuna is ieed of a serious upgrade to albacore, would be awesome because the ranch is killer too. Stir it up and try this place.",2
"Patio was beautiful on this perfect evening. Service was great! Food not so much. nMy son got the short rib tacos and they were delish. My Dixie chicken dinner was tasty, but defiantly needed some sauce and my broccoli was way too dry. My husband got the roitissorie chicken dinner and the best thing on the plate was the beans. Over priced? I think so.",1
Went there yesterday with a dear friend who's been there 3 days in a row and the place is simply great. Large portions of tender grilled chicken with several different sides and pricing was more than reasonable. I intend to go back with my wife and several other friends. It was very clean and well maintained and the manager made time to stop by our table and chat. A good expereince.,2
"Normally I have a good experience, but today I got two sausages breakfast burritos with wheat tortillas. Upon getting home I realized both tortillas were covered with mold. When I confronted the ""manager "" he mentioned that he had seen some with mold on them but continued to use them anyway. I was disgusted beyond belief.",1
"North Las Vegas Animal hospital is not a place I would go back to. It smelled HORRIBLE, staff is very unprofessional and look like crackheads. There is no care or compassion given to the pets at all! I took my dog there to get her shots and will not ever take her back just for those. Clearly this place is ONLY about making money!",1
"Le Thai is, without a doubt, the best place to eat on Fremont Street East AND West . The food is spiced exactly as you want it every time No surprises from night to night , and the options are many and varied! Do not miss this if you're downtown. I recommend getting a reservation, as this place fills up fast, especially on the weekends.",2
"I've been to this Krispy Kreme at least a dozen times over the past decade, between all the Vegas trips we take. And I must not have been back in quite a while, but, THEY CLOSED DOWN THE FACTORY! All the doughnuts seem to be shipped in, or are produced in another location. Strange no more hot Krispy Kremes off the line ",1
"Great staff, pretty good selection of equipment. On my second go around with their training staff, have seen great results. Boot camp twice a week, which is a fun challenge. Really, the only thing keeping it from five stars is that they're in an old building in an old shopping center. Could use a little stucco and fresh paint. Trainer Alexis is great, really knows how to kick your butt into shape.",2
"Least favorite location in town. It always takes forever, staff is unfriendly, and whether you go inside or through the drive thru.it's always a long wait. One time I waited 20 minutes to be told they were out of iced coffee.no thank you. I will drive out of my way to another location which is sad because one is the closest .",1
The food was great! But the service was horrible! we are still sitting at the table waiting for the waiter to get our cards. They had to confirm with us 3 times what each of us had ordered. The staff appears to be confused and also unapologetic that they are taking so long. There was also an automatic 18 gratuity. Would not have chosen that. This food is not worth the trouble!,1
Great food. Great people. Open late. And they have happy hours and deals on certain things. Foods of all kind. And they change the menu a lot. So you can always find something new to try. Definetly a place for dinner parties and families. They also have a show right in front for the tourists since we r in Las Vegas Baby!,2
"I'm from LA. Nothing will ever compare to Johnny Pastrami but this satisfies me pretty good until then. Husband gets the Capastrami, which i have to admit looked AMAZING. However I wanted a regular Hot Pastrami, not on the menu but they made it for me. Enough of each sauce, pickles and 20 for 2 medium footlong subs. We eat here about once a month for our Pastrami cravings, no complaints. YUM.",2
"I've been dying to have one of their goblets! We had the lollipop one and it was delicious. Extremely pricey for one drink, but I would defiantly recommend trying one at least once. We had perfect seats half in and out of the restaurant that we got to see the Bellagio fountain show while drinking our goblet. The store is also cool, but I personally wouldn't spend 20 on a sucker.",2
"Authentic and tasty, no question. Enjoyed a burrito con al pastor, which had that lively, slightly sweet flavor. It was excellent and plenty large. The salsa is clearly made in house and is also delicious and comes with the meal, I might add . As good as Mexican gets in CU. Here's to hoping the steady volume of traffic I've noted driving by and visiting the once continues.",2
"It wasn't even busy, but for some reason or another, we had to wait for 20 minutes before water was served then another 15 minutes for our order to be taken, The shrimp pasta dinner was good, but the potato appetizer was like runny warm potato salad. In summary, the service was horrible and the food was mediocre. My friends and I won't be dining there ever again.",1
"One of my favorite Chinese joints in college. Portions are huge, so large that I think 2 people can finish one lunch item. The menu has so many varieties of foods. I love the fried rice here.The staff is nice and they have a lot of seating to accommodate a large group. Very inexpensive and I highly recommend it!",2
Sapporo is solid. Went with boyfriend and family visiting from out of town for teppan happy hour 7 days a week. 3 7pm . As entertaining and delicious as promised. A ton of food. NYstrip and chicken were delicious as was the veggies. Ok fried rice. Scallops well cooked but not very tasty. Sushi was great as well. The bus boy was pretty shocked there were no leftovers. Go early to avoid the crowd.,2
"This place is decent for a bar but the food is terrible . I would go for drinks only if anything. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because they recently opened, but waiting 15 minutes for drinks isn't acceptable. Maybe they should focus on hiring servers who have severed before and not just attractive girls. Their beer selection was pretty good and they had a lot of tvs.",1
"Came here to see my high school friend Warren B. Hall! He is so funny. We were greeted at the door, we got to pick a table close to the stage. The server was great. One bad thing, not enough bathrooms. They opened up to the Venue side to let us use the bathrooms but they were gross. I don't think they cleaned it from Saturday night. EKKKK.",2
"I'm never a fan of this chain really. For the prices they charge you can get so much better somewhere else. But I was in an airport. And really hungry. So I went here, plus the airport had WiFi so it wasnt so bad. But yeah the food is all meh and the price is crap. Go to cheesecake factory if you are looking for the same prices but better food.",1
"Hubby and I stopped in for a quick bite. It's not very often that we both order the same thing so tonight was an exception. The short rib barbecue with coleslaw was very good. It is served with fries or you can up order to onion rings for 2 more. Hubby also enjoyed a vanilla milkshake which he declared pretty good, which is high praise in his vocabulary.",2
"The music was all right. The experience as a whole was not at all good. I got my money stolen from my pocket and on contacting the security, they said they could not do anything as the girl who stole did not have it on her person duh! . Ruined my whole Vegas trip! Will not be going to this place during my next trips. Just be aware of your things and wallet.",1
"I love Caesar's Palace and the Forum Shops. I always stay here when i'm in Vegas, but I am still waiting for them to ban smoking indoors. It's ridiculous that in 2014 you can still smoke indoors. I hate that when I come to EVERY casino I smell like a dirty ashtray and my sinuses swell and I feel like shit. Seriously, why people? Ban smoking and you get 5 !",1
"This place is fantastic. I love the old school Vegas y feel to it and the dj playing all the throwback hip hop pretty much made my night. The bathrooms are clean. Holly, our VIP hostess was all kinds of awesome. I will definitely be heading back to Mabels! Ladies thank you for an awesome night. That was probably the most fun I've had in a very long time!",2
"My Husband Loves In N Out Burgers, I like them, but not my favorite, until I found out about their special ordered Animal Burger, and found out today, that they have yellow Hot Peppers, I had asked them years ago, if they had jalepeno's, and was told no, and wasn't told that they had yellow peppers, Wow ! What a difference the peppers make on my burgers, now I like it just as much as my Husband !",2
"Haifa Restaurant recently catered an event that I attended. The food was shockingly bad. The hor d'oeuvres were actually extremely good, so we had high hopes, but the actual meals were barely edible. And served on paper plates with plastic silverware! and this was not food that could physically be cut with plastic . I did not visit the actual restaurant, so I cannot judge other than catering.",1
We sat at the bar and bartender did a great job serving us. The fried calamari is to die for nice and tender and not rubbery as in many places. We also did the wok fried curry noodles which were fantastic. Dragon Noodle is a great place within the Monte Carlo Hotel and casino to enjoy oriental food away from the noise and smoke of the casino.,2
"This was the worst experience we've ever had at this Red Robbin. Our food didn't make It to the table for almost 50 minutes. Then the waitress, had a very unwelcoming attitude when we asked for more fries, as I we were bothering her. It'll be a long time before we come back to this place, and that's too bad, because I love it here.",1
Visiting Scottsdale and happened across this lounge restaurant. Made it just in time for happy hour and received half off our appetizers and maki rolls. Portion size was way larger than expected and have wonderful leftovers. Delicious sushi and the waitress was super friendly and helpful about info of the local area. Will def go again if ever in town.,2
"This is the best hipster watching, crepe eating, latte drinking place I know! The hubs and I love to go to Jobot for breakfast and great coffee on the weekends. Relaxed atmosphere, nice staff, tasty crepes, delicious coffee, rotating artists work on the walls and free wifi. What else could you want from your neighborhood coffee shop?",2
"This is a great shop for costumes, with staff that takes costuming seriously and goes above and beyond to get it right. We needed 'American Idol' judges costumes and the costume designer brought out magazine pictures of the judges and a large selection of choices and accessories to get everything just right. Very impressed!",2
"I really love this place, I called ahead made a reservation for one. I was seated by the aquarium which is so serene I immediately fell in love. My server was so helpful and nice. The food was so good and the drink menu was fantastic. I seriously recommend this place to anyone going downtown, I absolutely fell in love.",2
"So my friends and I always come here. For some reason today, was the worse experience I've had here. The server and was extremely rude. We ordered bulgogi, and I thought under the assumption, if we say I'm ordering for two, and we purposely sat at a table with a BBQ stove. The assumption would be that we would be doing BBQ. So they just brought us cooked bulgogi.",1
"Eaten here 50 or more times. Food is very good, always clean. Hot and sour soup is always great. Serves canned soda but I don't see that as a drawback unless you expect free refills. Jenny the owner is really sweet but gets lost with big tables and it has helped that she always has help now with the table service.",2
"Yelp stated it was closed Saturday night but it was open. This is a total college bar so if you're over 25 don't bother. Waiting in line just to make it look busy so that was lame. Then 3rd floor smelled like vomit, liquor, and cheap perfume. .lol over all it was entertaining but I wouldn't go again unless I'm trying to pick up trashed white girls who think they can twerk.",1
"First of all I gotta start by commenting on all the white people trying to ""rate "" this place cuz they don't know REAL mexican food. They just need to shut up! Secondly, there is no good mexican food in AZ. This place is by far the best place I've found, the fajitas r good, the nachos r good, the chicken flautas r good. No complaints, after all this is AZ.",2
"Not my favorite Dillard's but I had to exchange my some shirts I bought for my husband and the lady working in the men's department was very helpful finding the right sizes. On the other hand, the girls in the fragrance and make up departments were completely useless! They were more interested in gossiping than making a sale. Bad bad experience.",1
Wanted to go to Sakana and it was packed . Went to Blue Wasabi and the fact that it was not even filled up should have been a warning. Over priced! The tuna poke was 17 and came in a small martini glass that was filled with lettuce. The specialty rolls had so much rice that I left feeling like I ate a bowl of rice. The service was good.,1
"I set up an appointment on WAHOO because my finger nail Got torn back and pulled out, after waiting and arriving they refused service. He said "" I dont remove nails, go to the hospital. "" What's the point of an urgent care if they refuse Non emergency treatments. Since I had to choose a rating they get one star instead of 0",1
"If you're ready to lose over half of your deposit, this is your choice. Pro great maintainance. Con their properties are mostly old before 70s . So everything is old and not work perfectly. Some electric wiring problems happen. At the end of the day, some stuff are old and need replace maintainance. They all count on your deposit.",1
"This was an unexpected find! The location is a bit difficult to locate as it's sort of ""around the back "" but it's cute as a button inside. Our server was friendly and attentive. My chicken souvlaki was delicious. I was wishing we had room for dessert! If I find myself in this neighborhood again, I will definitely stop back in.",2
"This place is delicious! I love the pan roast! I always crave this stuff but unfortunately they don't have one when I live in San Diego. Hopefully they will open one there one day! Yes, there's usually a wait but it's definitely worth it. Due to the limited seating, Its best to go in groups of 2 or 3. Enjoy!",2
Mediocre food. Had fish and chips. Fish was overcooked and coating was charred. Chips were soggy and flavorless. Kitchen was SLOW. It took over an hour from when we were seated until we were served our entree. This might be a good place if you want to drink a lot of beer and don't care when your food arrives or what it tastes like.,1
We never got a chance to try the food because we were so turned off by the way we were treated. The read headed manager at this location is HORRIBLE. How the hell she was chosen to run a customer service driven establishment is BEYOND me. My family and I will be waiting for a table across the parking lot at The Cheesecake Factory.,1
"They are really packed on weekends. I would recommend going early to find parking. The lines can be long and could take a while to get through. The seating is packed inside and pretty warm . I don't like being seated next to strangers, but when the theatre is so packed it's impossible to get a good seat alone . I would rather pay a bit more and go to amc.",1
"The pizza is amazing. We stopped in when they opened on a Sunday and the restaurant filled within 10 minutes. I cannot wait until we dine there again. They have other food but the pizza was so amazing I might have to go 3 or 4 times before I try anything else. This is literally the best pizza I have ever tasted. A close 2nd is a Neapolitan place in Sheboygan, WI. AMAZING PIZZA!",2
"I don't think it's the most impressive cuisine, nothing too outside the box, but the food is still pretty good. The service was amazing and the vibe was lively. It's definitely my favorite spot for drinks and small plates at Scottsdale Quarter. My friends and I all had a wonderful time on the patio one night. Couldn't have asked for a nicer waitress or better table.",2
"This place is way too expensive. Over 20 dollars for one burrito and a plate of nachos? I didnt even get drinks! Nachos claimed to be for 4 6 people but was barely enough for 2! Get real. And it tastes like any other mediocre Mexican restaurant. Plus they charge for sourcream. .really? Thanks, but no thanks Cafe Rio. I'll stick with Chipotle.",1
"I highly recommend this cleaners. I brought in a very soiled prom dress and it turned out INREDIBLE. ! Looks brand new, The people who run this cleaners are the nicest and gave such great service. They acted like they truley cared., what a pleasant surprise these days. And the prices are so resonable.",2
I came here yesterday for the first time and I was highly disappointed. The wait was too long and my Ever Green SMOOTHIE was wayyy too watery. I told one of the workers and she told me to wait and that she'll make me another one and it took about 15 minutes before I got my drink. Maybe next time I'll try something else besides a smoothie.,1
"Why eat at a chain restaurant when you can eat here. Food quality, and more importantly taste is far better than any chain food. Price can't be beat. For my money this is the best bean burrito in the world. Strips with cheese and sauce are the way to do. Red beef burrito is like something I haven't ate since the late 60s.in other words its good. And did I mention price?",2
"If ONLY there were 0 stars! so glad to be out of this dump solely because of the incompetent management. Believe the negative reviews! The old staff WestCorp were beyond professional accomodating. However, everything went downhill as soon as they were bought out. Glad to be out good riddance South BLVD!",1
"I enjoy taking my kids to this yogurt place. The only thing I'd change is for them to get some more flavors change them more often. It seems like everytime I go they have the same flavors and it gets boring. Other than that it's a great place. Tastes good, friendly workers, and i love the punch card that they offer.",2
"Have bought Tires for my Jag here, Took my cadillac in for tire install and alignment knew it needed repair at rear brake axel had them do a quote and perform the work. the car gave them fits but they did the work and cost was even lower than quoted due to some parts not being needed. Will be coming back with one of my other Cadillacs for tire install next week.",2
I really love the people here. Everyone is very nice. The breakfast is made fresh every day. Omelet bar made fresh every morning. Free drinks here from 530 730 pm.Both main bartenders have been here for 17 years. They are great. Exercise room is available. Treadmill and elliptical machines are a hit.,2
"Great Place. All kinds of different delicious pretzels. I dislike cake so for my birthday last year they made me a huge Pretzel in the shape of 40, My birthday is coming up again and I just went up to tell them I'll be needing a 41 next month. Friendly people, great prices, just an all around great place!",2
"What's up with not handing out utensils with drive thru orders? Cutting costs? Pretty inconsistent. Those working the drive thru window couldn't care less if they get your order right. One morning I had to wait 10 minutes while the chick was too busy refilling hot sauce, meanwhile my food is sitting in the pass. Pay attention?",1
"Broth was good but it wasn't hot like pho is suppose to be. Actually, the best word to describe it was lukewarm. I couldve asked them to heat it up but they took a while to bring the food and i was RAVENOUS like a zombie. 4 stars for that. I like how this place is 24hr. We don't have many of those in my area. 1 star. No other complaints.",1
"One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Every time I go I get the Prime burger with blue cheese, and frites on the side. I haven't been able to try anything else because I love this burger so much! Their prices are very reasonable. 13 for the burger I get. We went last night on a saturday at 7pm and waited an hour and a half for a table on the patio. The service is great as well.",2
"bad service. they forgot to seat us, sat us at table that was open for 30 min. , they never took drink orders then took 45 min to bring out a diet coke. Onion soup was good, the rest of the parties food was good, my steak was bad, really bad. Tasted like it was from Dennys. Maybe I got a bad cut, but I wouldn't go back.",1
Odd decor worst service.happy hour is not 50 off as per the phone we need to the restaurantand yelp. And if you ask the waitress about that She will ignore you and then throw a check at you. We complain to management and we got a coupon for 20 percent of our next visit. lowes coupons went into the trash never visiting again,1
This place works wonders. I always walk out feeling like a new person ready to accomplish the world. I've received a massage from every massage therapist there and have been beyond impressed with there relaxation and masseuse techniques. After I also go to Dr. Marino for an adjustment that is the best is the valley. I highly recommend this place! Give it a try!,2
Just another place trying to make money just off the name. Let's just say. I would not go back to this location. After eating at the one in LA. I don't even know how they can even call themselves Pinks. They should just call themselves Just another hot dog place. Very disappointed and I got a stomach ache after eating a chili dog.,1
"Staple in my household for six years now.We have had a birthday party there for at least one of my kids for the last six years. This is the first year were it wasn't there package party in five years. If you sign up for their emails, you can get great coupons. Then you can pop in for sodas and games. Honestly, the pizza did get better. It's not Pizza Hut, but not as yucky as it used to be!",2
"Super slow! Just in case if u will have Charlie server, better refuse his service ask for another one. Brought just drinks in 15 minutes.I asked for extra plate. Yes, he brought . way AFTER I finished meal. Really? But he immediately brought a bill! He knew he screwed up! I had to edit review . He brought a bill , yes without a pen! Had to call near by server for a pen!",1
We were married in the Broderie Garden Room at Phipps Conservatory last week in Pittsburgh. Colleen and her staff were outstanding. They managed the day perfectly. They went above and beyond to make our guests comfortable and were a pleasure to work with. Beautiful setting and outstanding staff. I highly recommend Phipps for a great experience.,2
I've been to their old location inside the meadows mall.and after when they switched in front of the mall. Ice been driving across town to diyas and when I saw this location I decided to give it a try agai The lady is nice but fairly new she didn't know how to shake them and clean them also it hurts so bad when she does them.,1
"This place ROCKS! I get all my morning Joe there. The product is awesome! The Baristas are very friendly. They know what I want before I ask, they are very tuned in to their regulars. I have never had a bad experience at Dutch Bros. Thanks to all the staff at Bell Rd. For making my day a lot better!",2
"If you're been to Teharu in Tempe, don't bother going here. It's soooooo over priced its not even funny. The sushi was average, but then again I didn't taste everything because everything that looked decent was on a gold plate, which is 4.50 EACH. and most of the time it was only three pieces. So that makes it a 12 roll. I'll pass.",1
"Very good burger fries. The meat is brought in fresh everyday, so I was told. Lady behind the counter sold me on a piece of peach pie. She said the fruit pies are made fresh daily. This place reminds me of an old school diner from back in the day. Think I will try the hash browns next visit. They looked really good and crisp.",2
"I've heard of at least three people getting wrong genders from here. One of them is my friend! Prices seem really high. Also, the place so hard to find but we finally found it. The room is not nearly as big nor were the couches as comfy as Miracle in Progess which is where we went last time. This place is ok but with the new HD machine over at Miracle in Progress, they just can't compare.",1
"Absolutely the best liquor store in the world or at least in Vegas. The moment you walk in you feel like you just arrived in Alcohol Heaven! It can overwhelm you but in a good way. Total Wine can put the biggest alcoholic aka expert to the test! Easy to navigate, cheapest prices, and the widest selection of EVERYTHING. What's not to love about this place and give it the 5 stars it deserves?",2
"Ice was choppy even after zamboni. No attendant on ice to referee reckless skaters or monitor bad falls. Kids coming out on ice in their tennis shoes. No rubber mats out, so if you brought your own skates you'd mess up the skating edge by walking on concrete. Employees seemed to be more into visiting with regulars. Session started 15 minutes late. I miss the ice rink at Metrocenter!",1
"We wandered around trying to find some good grub from Paris, to Cosmopolitan, and were soo happy to stumble onto Holsteins. ONe look at the menu and we were sold. We had the pork belly mini sliders, Almond Joy shakes, chicken fingers, sweet potato fries and the pumpkin shake. Sooo good! We might even go back today to try different burgers!",2
"I'm sorry Sprinkles. I really REALLY wanted to like you. I tried and tried but I couldn't do it. I've now had six different cupcakes from Sprinkles and didn't enjoy any of them. NOW the Strawberry frosting was delish, but the cake portion was just not up to par to that delicious frosting. Sad to say I'll stick to more local bakeries going forward!",1
"We've been here twice because well, we are new to AZ and didn't know anywhere else. They have a big menu.but that's it. I mean we didn't expect anything more than cheesecake factory but yeah.from my point of view, it wasn't even to cheesecake level. The service was descent though. Food ordinary, quickly prepared American food n Service descent n Atmosphere .interesting. n Price ok",1
"Even though my imaging experience was positive, I received inaccurate results on the MRI report. The report stated that I had a 60 70 tear. I did NOT. Instead, it was found to be a 20 tear AFTER I had surgery, so it did NOT need to be repaired. Not happy with this poor reporting after all. Very disappointing! I didn't even know that MRIs could be that inaccurate.",1
"Food is great but customer service is highly lacking. I received a packed To go bag. As I carried it out it slipped and I lost a taco. Their so called management charged me another 2.50 since it was to go and my fault. nI have eaten here weekly, I'm surprised they nailed me for it. Hope this gets corrected.",1
This was the worst hotel that I ever stayed in. my hubby and I took the smoking room and it stunk sooo bad that I wanted to throw up. I was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed. in the morning at 5am I wanted to leave the room cuz smell was sooo gross that woke me up! I felt so dirty that I took two showers AT Other HOTEL. I never thought that I will have nightmares bcz of bad and stinky hotel.,1
Can't believe I have to give one star. Went to have my vehicle inspected which isn't a big issue at all. But man they wanted to gouge me for everything you could imagine. And asking me to replace my wiper blades because they would fail when I had just replaced them that morning. I won't be going back and I only went there because it was close and convenient.,1
Well my wife and i go to sams alot for pet food and miscellaneous goodies we use alot .the main thing to remember about sams is they sell in bulk.BUT the samples and shopping experience is always a good one .the downfall is you have to be a member which is about 50 bucks a month depending on what plan you get.but i really enjoy it for the bulk items,2
"Very trendy, lounge and HOT ASS HOSTESSES! If you like night life and you want to pre game before going out, this is the place to be. Great atmosphere. Food is very good too. Best part of this restaurant, people. nPlenty of beautiful people to look at while eating. nEye candies left and right. Mmm Merci Bercoup!",2
Talbot Photography did a great job at my wedding. He and his assistant seamlessly handle formal high definition shots that need organization of large groups and fun candid art shots as well. Mr. Talbot also did portraits of my sister who is a musician which look fabulous. The turn around time on getting the photos was really fast as well. I would definitely recommend him to anyone.,2
"The Sugar Factory Signature Burger is to die for. It has a white chocolate bun and the cheese and onion rings all melt together and you'll be sure you've died gone to heaven in the city of sin. Make sure to get reservations, it gets really busy at times. It's great for big parties. Dessert is amazing as well, but be sure to share.",2
"Just had dinner here tonight and as usual it was wonderful. It's Good Food, the service is excellent. It is a bit small cozy but they have patio service also so when the weather breaks lower than 120 degrees we will be able to enjoy. They also have a great brunch on the weekends with Mimosa Bloody Mary specials. Yum!",2
Was in Las Vegas for the weekend and found this great place for frozen yogurt. The mango flavor was the best I had ever had in a very long time. it was fruity and it did not require any additional topping as it was perfect the way it was. Service here was friendly and fast. the price was alright too. I was very happy that I came across this place!,2
This establishment should be closed. It took over 45 minutes to receive our order of soup noodles. After the extensige delay they forgot to give us spoons which took another 3 requests and 15 minutes to get. Once we were able to eat the noodles they weren't cooked all the way. In the end this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.,1
"Boba. West coast boba. We were craving boba after dim sum, so off we went down the street to tea station. I got a hibiscus something black tea, and man, the boba was good! A simple midwestern girl like me.happy with good tasting boba. Who would have thought. The boba was the right amount of chewyness. I mean, don't get me wrong, tea station isn't like your Joy Yees, but still, definitely good.",2
"The food was so good that I decided to start writing reviews on Yelp. The garlic shrimp was amazing! The Sangria with sparkling wine was great I love girly drinks . We also had the filet mignon burger, lamb skewers, fries and another one of the meat skewers among three girls and the food was more than enough. They were all good but definitely recommend the garlic shrimp!",2
"I do not recommend. This place is expensive for what it is. They were unaware they even have this Yelp promotion. They hesitantly gave me 10 off one of my entrees but not my entire order. A group of 3 people that looked like they knew the worker arrived and placed their order after me, but got their order before me. Just bad customer service.",1
"Having come from LA with a large Vietnamese community, this is not the same Bahn Mi I'm accustomed to. Heck they couldn't even make a decent vegetarian. I will commend them on their clean facilities and quick service however. Oh but if you're an attractive young lady expect some disrespect from the male staff.",1
"Southwest just kicks ass. They always have amazingly cheap flight specials, are on time, and their crew rocks. Any airline that will let their flight attendants sing the destination over the loudspeaker is ok with me. Plus, they're not subscribing to this ridiculous fee for bags thing that everyone else is doing. I can't really ask for much more in an airline.",2
"I love this restaurant. Great lunch specials and a huge menu. Lot's of sushi specials. Fast service and a great lunch staff. Will definatley be back. Best kept secret in Phoenix. Express lunch service during the day and wait service in the evening. Several wines to choose from, also Sake and Japanese beers. Good happy hour specials 3 to 6 and 8 30 to closing.",2
"Meh. nThe wait to check in was long and annoying. The spa was mediocre facial was really great massage seemed rushed and routine The rooms decor was lousy. It was very old fashioned and desperately needed an upgrade. The food. The MGM has much better offerings. The buffet, The District, etc. Find somewhere else to stay!",1
"I have received nothing but exceptional work and service from Addison Landscape. I dealt directly with Addison the owner and he thoroughly answered all of our questions and ensured our project was complete on time. From start to finish Addison was professional, courteous and exceeded our expectations. I will recommend this company to friends and will hire them again for future work.",2
"I love Chick fil A. Their food is good, but their customer service and staff are incredible. With their help we pulled off an amazing fundraiser for my daughter's teacher who is fighting cancer. We had a busy night and they kept everything running perfectly. Thank you Robert, Stephanie, and the rest of your staff!",2
"This place has become my go to breakfast stop coming in, while in, and or about to leave town. I was very impressed with Munch's breakfast. The linguica they use is one of the best I've tasted. My scrambled eggs done to perfection. The hostess and my server 36, haha are friendly. I need to keep going back until I cover the menu.",2
"This staff at this United Blood service is first rate. Always quick and effiiant. They are always staffed and ready to go when I arrive for my appointment. I've donated blood at this location 10 times and have never had to wait. Of course, I can't encourage everyone enough to donate and donate often.",2
"Price's is the best fried chicken I have had down here in Charlotte thus far! I love how quick the service is. Not very convenient that its cash only but there is an ATM inside. I find it humorous that you get a package of ketchup attached to your fork by way of a rubber band. This is no four start establishment, far from it, but the chicken and the price is worth returning.",2
Best pupusas in Phoenix. They have good specials. I bring my family from Cali to eat here too and they say it's pretty good. I love how they stuff it especially with cheese. It's not as greasy as the other pupusas restaurants. Don't expect this place to be fancy but that's one of the things I can appreciate.focus more on the food rather then the place.,2
What a great selection of beer and whisky. The wife dropped me off here while she went shopping and I was glad she did. The bartender took me on a quick tour of both the beer room and the whisky attic both were amazing. n The food was great. Great chili that had the HEAT! The wife had the crack and cheese deep fried mac and cheese which she described as one of the best things she has ever eaten.,2
We had the seasonal special which was pheasant. I wasn't too sure about it bad experience with pheasant in the past but it was surprisingly good. The sweet potato fries were delicious. That is all we had since it was just a snack to sample them but it was good enough that I will return and give it another round in the future.,2
"I enjoyed this spot alot while visiting Arizona. The vibe was cool and they had some nice beer and wine selections. We went to see ""Interview with a Vampire "", but it was sold out ,so I caught ""Vampires vs Superheroes "". Its definitely a different way to enjoy a indie movie or a old school favorite. . If ever in the Phoenix art district , treat yourself to this jewel.",2
"See ""Bud W. "" review. As you can tell this is a hole in the wall place but sooo much better tasting food than Roberto's. I don't know what they season the carne asada with but it gives it a much better flavor than the blandness of Roberto's. Always quick service and good service. Definitely worth the hunting, finding and stopping here. 9am 9pm",2
If this were the only Smith's in town it would be closed. The employees are lazy rude and the place is always in a state of disarray. Like Sandi K said they have the entrance blocked up with sale items and of course the CASINO is right inside the door for the gamblers. nWe only shop here when other locations are out of SALE items and for some reason this loccation has an adequate supply.,1
"Possibly the best Greek bakery in the city, certainly one of the most beautiful with it's stained glass, dark polished wood, ancient iron oven, and glass counters stacked with the fattest, prettiest baklava you can imagine. Everyone behind the counter and in line is speaking Greek, and there is a mountain of Easter bunnies, and if heaven looks at all like this I want in.",2
Disrespectful! Thrifty Ice Cream customers do not get any respect at this store. You have to tell the clerk to wear gloves. One clerk coughed over my ice cream I refused to buy it and tonight I was next in line but the clerk decided to let somebody at the register get cigs. Not right girlie. I will find another store in town with Thrifty's Ice Cream before I go back there.,1
Easily in my top 5 restaurants in Charlotte. The Mussels are to die for! I can always count on this place for being consistently awesome and is always the first restaurant i take any guests from out of town to impress them. As for brunch.don't even get me started. It's Heaven in a buffet. You just can't lose with this place.,2
Theater was uncomfortably warm even after u told management about the issue. I guess they don't care if its warm if the theater is not even half full. Go figure that's why people don't come here. We only went because we have a Groupon deal if not we won't pay for full price for it. My first experience with this theater was good with IMAX but that was 2 3 years ago.,1
"love the rooftop of pure, we did bottle service here and had our own section, the security we had at our area was great. it was pricy for bottle service but hey this is vegas! you get what you pay for great music danced the night away while overlooking the strip in amazing weather! i have many birthdays in vegas and this was my to go place!",2
"Love Mezzo's! I've been there three times now and they never fail to bring out excellent food. They are a little slow, but that's because everything is cooked fresh to order and you can really taste the difference this makes. Also, they now offer gluten free pasta cooked to perfection! nIf you have special dietary needs, Mezzo will definitely alter their dishes to serve your needs.",2
"This was my first time here and I came to give it a try. First of all don't try and use the 50 off for checking in they don't honor it. The food was O.K. At best. I was really just looking for a cool place to hangout near my house and have a few drinks but the atmosphere isn't great either. On a plus, happy hour goes from 2 7 everyday.",1
Love this place. Delicious chicken fried perfectly. The only downside is this place is CASH ONLY but they do have an ATM inside in case you dont have cash i never do the food is basically made to order unless you call ahead your order will most likely be done before you get there. I wait inside and then walk home and its still warm and delcious.,2
I'm from NYC and this place beats ALL of the vietnamese restaurants we have here. Atmosphere ALL asians! Ha! Food Our food came quick. I got the a spicy beef noodle soup. Soup was so sweet and savory. So delicious. My bowl was not fill with oil either. Noodles were cooked to perfection. Spring rolls they call them summer rolls fried egg rolls were so crispy and yummy!,2
"BEWARE! This car wash damaged my 2008 Yukon Denali . Spoke with one of the owners, Justin, and he refused to work with me to get the damaged piece repainted. Do not believe that the ""We Are Responsible "" sign out in front means anything. The brushes are very rough on the vehicle. If you have a dark colored vehicle i would not use this car wash, go to a touchless.",1
"This place is AWESOME! You just have to know where to look. Best tip about this place The entrance I found was in a neighborhood there is a tiny little sign for the park area, but you will most likely find it from a few cars parked along the side of the street where no houses or driveways are found.",2
"Just okay. Yes, prime rib was good. BBQ was mediocre. A long line getting to our table was a definite bummer. But we did enjoy desserts, salads, and a few main courses. For the price it was a screaming value, at lunchtime. So overall, we enjoyed it. The chicken was good. Asian station was good. Food was well prepared and overall we enjoyed it.",2
"We used to come here all the time and the sandwiches were some of the best in the city. Now the sandwiches are made ""subway "" style with very little thinly sliced cheap meat and still charging the higher price, which used to be worth it! The pictures on their menus and ads are NOT what your sandwich will be like at all not like it used to be ! Stop supporting this major rip off place!",1
Their teriyaki pineapple chicken sandwich is AMAZING. And their fries are very good as well. Perfect flavors! I have been in Phoenix for work for about a week and have eaten here three times so far! If I lived here I would eat here a ton! And their drink selection is also extensive.I tried some old styled root beers and cream sodas!,2
"I went there for lunch and the first thing I noticed was that the prices were a littler higher than most restaurants, however the service was very friendly and food was incredible. I got the grilled chicken sandwich and was not disappointed! I say defiantly go. The atmosphere is fun and has a laid back island feel.",2
My wife went was referred to Fitness Road about a month ago and finally went yesterday and purchased a pair of Vibram Fivefinger shoes. She was extremely impressed with the level of service she received. She wore the shoes around most of the day getting used to them and is excited to try them out on a hike this weekend! I'm sure I'll be in their shortly to get a pair myself!,2
I've been meaning to try this place for months and I'm glad I finally did. Pizza is the best I've had in Vegas and Biaggio is very friendly. He came over to the table numerous times to make sure everything was great. At 6 for 2 slices and a drink its a great value for lunch. Cant wait to go back and try the sandwiches and other pizzas!,2
"Awesome decor! Really nice wait staff and reasonably priced for Vegas. My cheese enchiladas get 3 stars, but my wife had the ""pink taco "" and they were great! They had some kind of pickled onion on them that was super tasty. They also feature tricked out low rider bicycles for your viewing pleasure.",2
"Planet Hollywood is another good spot in vegas. Their shopping is probably some of the best being that they just finished the huge remodel to change over from Aladin a few years ago. Their casino is a lot of fun with the girls dressed the best in vegas in my opinion. They have very reasonable minimums throughout the day especially early on, and I had a pretty good time in their poker room.",2
"ya, this place was pretty lame. The night we were in there, they were giving away two for one drinks, and there was no cover, cause they couldn't get anyone in the doors. we did a couple shots, and bailed. As we were walking thru excalibur, found a random keroake bar, that was actually much more happening.",1
"Had the marinated pork burrito. The pork was very good juicy and flavorful. The rest, however, just wasn't good. The tortilla was noticeably sweet an interesting touch, but it just didn't work with the rest of the ingredients. Rice was a bit acrid, as well. Despite the good reviews I've seen, it's unfortunately a place that I probably won't be going back to.",1
"This place is really not great. The fajitas are, to be generous, merely ok, and much of the fare is actually bad. but i go here weekly. b c it is in my office building and the other option is quizno's. so, i would mainly recommend this if you work in my building and are too lazy to walk to quizno's. god, that's sort of a depressing thought.",1
This place is quickly becoming a favorite. Tried it with a co worker on a Wednesday then took the wife back for breakfast on the next Sunday. both breakfast and lunch were outstanding. I have had a club sandwitch before but something about the flavors in Hers that just put it way better than any other I have had. can't wait to try more things.,2
This isn't the real Caesar's Palace is it? n Alan from Hangover The most celebrated casino hotel in Vegas. I truly like Caesar's Palace its been at the strip for a long time and has a unique history. There wouldn't be a Vegas without Caesar's. I enjoy shopping here and gambling. I haven't checked out the rooms in the new Caesar's yet . I recently saw the movie Hangover and now I am yearning to go.,2
"Hotel experience was the worst! They started extremely loud construction at 10am on a Sunday. When we called the front desk to complain, they told us that's just the way it is. They wouldn't let us check in an hour early, which is understandable, but that was a first for me. They should discount the rooms during construction!",1
"I certainly enjoy a good cigar and one of the few places in Charlotte to light up this is one of my favorites. The bartenders are great, they are friendly and provide first class service. I will say that the cigar selection is a little disappointing but they don't mind if you bring your own. As for prices, well like most cigar bars you will pay for the privilege to smoke indoors.",2
"Pricey at 45 each plus tip for someone bringing drinks and alcohol costs extra, for dinner. But that's average compared to every other place around. Excellent food selection. Prime rib, crab legs dry rub ribeye were worth the price alone. The desserts are wonderful we tried 10 or more they were all yummy! Mac cheese truffle scalloped potatoes were amazing too.",2
There are a lot of good inexpensive Indian restaurants in Montreal. This isn't one of them. Too much of the food is pre cooked and re heated upon ordering and the combination of flavours in the sauces is mundane at best. We ate at the restaurant once and ordered take out on another occasion. Neither experience was satisfying which is a shame. The restaurant is close to home.,1
I love going to this place on Thursday for 35c wing! Seriously you can get a full plate of nice big size wings for about 4.25. They have the best wings I've ever tasted. Their fries are homemade and very yummy. I wanted to try so many different things on the menu but I just can't give up their wings!,2
"I had a very positive experience with Timberbush on the Loch Lomond, Trossachs, Stirling tour. Like another reviewer, we had Peter as our guide. He was excellent, very knowledgeable about the sites and surroundings. nConsidering how much everything costs in the UK, I felt that the price of u00a329 was pretty good for an entire day tour.",2
"If i could leave less than 1 star i would. Horrible., Horrible! Order making. 3 times in a row that they repeat the order correctly but cannot make it right. Missing items, raw egg yolk in breakfast jack. Large fries that have small portions. Please avoid this location. They will fail you. Its comical at this point. I gave up.",1
"Nice enough staff and more importantly a perfect location to where I was staying. Tried to call for a pickup but they were busy so I just walked. Had to wait 5 10 minutes for my car to be ready, and a coffee or a water while I waited would have beeice. Some other Enterprises offer this. But hardly anything to take major points away.",2
OH macy's. the only reason I give them an extra star is because I want to host their Thanksgiving Day Parade. What can one say about macy's. Its not exactly the pinnacle of fashion for anyone in any sense. And its definitely not the place to find a bargain. And they have their own brand called the Charter Room. That just makes me irritated for unexplained reasons. YOU LOOSE MACY'S!,1
By far the worst calamari I have ever had. Spinach artichoke dip tasted gross. Appetizer sampler was not worth it. Only thing that tasted alright was the coconut shrimp. For entree I had orange peel chicken and that was okay. To be honest everything was overpriced for what it is so I don't think I'll be coming back.,1
"The room stunk like smoke even though it was a non smoking room. They also charge you a resort fee of 25 or so to use their pools and business center. The sad part about that was, we weren't told that we were being charged. We left with a very sour feeling of the MGM Grand. Also, very low water pressure for shower.",1
"Never going there again! My wife and My 8 yr old son got food poisoning the last time we were there, my son got it from the kids pizza and carrots with ranch, and my wife got it from their chicken fingers with fries with ranch. As soon as we left there they had a really bad stomach ache and started throwing up everywhere and had to rush to the nearest restroom.",1
"Great Food, Fun atmosphere, Amazing Staff. Food I have NEVER had a bad meal. nAtmosphere Fun Decor Clean environment nStaff Good at the door, Amazing wait staff. The only thing I would like to change is the wait time. Everyone wants to eat there so. makes the wait long. they need to open another location ",2
"Came here for a quick breakfast before heading to the airport. Never thought house of blues served food, but this location does. To eat, I had the bacon avocado benedict, which was good. I also had their cajun bloody mary that came with a little shrimp. That was really good too. Overall, decent place for brunch.",2
"What a great time YELP HELPS 2013.,All the vendors presented their best products and the Organizations showed the important work they do for the Pittsburgh Community.I especially liked Luke Wholeys Mahi Mahi and Vito Girosole's RED RIBBON soda pop.Ciao Vito molto bene!.Thanks Rachel and all the YELPERS for another fantastic evening. Gary Katocs",2
"This is the worst Tim hortons I've ever been. They constantly mess up everything and are too lazy to even stir a coffee. Don't even think of ordering any food because if it isn't a donut they will mess it up. They only hire people that are clearly stupid and can only manage to work at a Tim hortons for the rest of their life. I have never encountered more ignorant, idiotic employees.",1
"I had breakfast again at Raffles for the second time in 2010 this November while on vacation from the Hawaii. I ordered the Norwegian Benedict and totally enjoyed my breakfast. The staff seemed to be worn out and zombie like maybe due to the 120,000 auto after market convention people and three battalions of Marines in town for the weekend. This time at Raffles food 4 stars staff 3 stars.",2
"I started my bikram ""yoga "" career at this location! I had just done two classes before moving to a different location. I enjoyed the experience and still continue to do bikram but the room was too stuffy and muggy for me! The carpet always felt damp and really grossed me out when walking on or touching it. Besides the carpet, the instructors are great and facility is wonderful!",2
"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant! I love it, my wife and kids love it. Spring rolls and Pho is on point. Non greasy, just right. Great affordable price. fun and easy place to bring the family. I love them so much that I am networking with them. Highly recommended. Oh yeah and the clams are like you never had them before.",2
"We had cashew chicken 12 , sweet sour chicken 12 one brown rice and one white rice and a cup of Tom kha gai soup costing a total of 35 before tip. Service was reasonable, food was OK but lacked intricate Thai flavors and pricing was expensive. Last weeks trip to Nonthaporns in Mesa on Main is a superior choice",1
"My go to place for caffeine, pastries and occasionally the stinky bun french toast. Can be hard to find a seat at peak bunch times and sometimes the kitchen seems slow but but it is still the best breakfast place I have been to on the east side. I particularly like the tarts the sell though they tend to be under cooked.",2
"The service today really was disappointing and slow. They only had one person that worked the cash register in the whole place and she was also restocking which took away from her register duties. It took several mins just to get an acknowledgement and several more to place an order. Funny thing I was the only person in line. Normally, we never have any issues with this location.",1
"Delicious food! Their burgers are always amazingly fresh and tasty. Normally I always have great customer service, but this last time the server seemed too busy doing her closing duties as opposed to bringing our food out on time. It was a bit on the cold side.disappointing, but still good! Would give it a 5 star, but this last time really bummed me out. Hopefully next time I get warmer food!",2
"I love this place mainly because these guys take their pies very seriously. I love their white pie, but truly cant be disapointed with any pizza on the menu. This is the best pizza place for take out outside the strip. The owner is a very passionate man who appreciates a good quality product everytime.",2
"I'm surprised at the number of negative comments I am seeing about BWW. My hubby and I have been coming here at least once per month for years, usually on Friday nights. We are on a first name basis with some of the friendly and attentive staff Marissa is awesome! . We have NEVER had a bad meal here! Occasionally the wait times are a bit long but hey, it's Friday night! We absolutely love BWW!",2
"The server was drunk and spoke really loudly, frequently yelling across the restaurant! The service was sub par, and I never got the Ponzu sauce I ordered. nThe food was pretty good, although I've had better for the same price range. My sunomono salad tasted like it was literally made of pickles. My friends enjoyed their AYCE however. nI won't be going back to Sumo. Sorry guys.",1
"Place is so grossss total dump, I recently went to tempe for spring training and this place was right next door to our hotel ""comfort inn "" this place is a dump big mistake food is like rubber and greasy not to mention you have to pay sauce? that is just stupid not to mention it's cash out, that should of been a red flag for dump. Gave me an upset stomach",1
Terrible pedicure. My heels and feet are still stained black from my shoes. The massage was short. Polish job appears to be good. Overall it was a very disappointing experience. Staff was also unorganized for our group. 6 people booked with only 4 pedicure chairs available. I don't think I'll be back.,1
"First and last time going to this place. I got there at 12pm ordered a jerk chicken sandwich and a salad for my wife. At 12 40pm the manager comes and tells me its going to be a few minutes more. To which I replied ""What "" you mean to tell me it takes u 40 minutes to make a salad and a sandwich. And the place was not even full of people. Bad service do not recommend going there.",1
Sadly this place is only serving up two good things. Catfish and yams. Their greenbeans were bland. nOkra tasted old and dried out. nFried Chicken was standard. nGreens were good buy missing some seasoning. nThe cornbread was a big ol square mound of possibly uncooked sweet cornmeal. Not interested in going back.,1
"My boyfriend and I came to visit Charlotte on vacation and heard good reviews about the mellow mushroom. We were very confused by the trippy atmosphere. We ordered pizza, salad and soup. The pizza was not cooked and the soup smelt absolutely horrible. We left and would not recommend or ever go back.",1
Was pleasanly greeted by the host when we entered. We asked to sit at the bar because we only wanted drinks and apps. The bar had only four other customers and we sat for almost ten minutes with not a single staff member coming by and saying hello. Both of the bartnders made eye contact with us and one even walked by. They apparently did not want our business so we left.,1
"I proceeded to watch the four people who ordered behind me get their food before me. All I had was a potato. One guy behind me got the same thing I did just a larger version and got his before I did. And when I finally got my potato, it barely had any toppings on it. Really dry. Not tasty. Saving grace is the free ice cream you get.",1
"Tried it again and I have to say it was very expensive and not worth the price. I ordered the Pasta Fagoli with a side of Spinach with Garlic. the Pasta Fagoli was terrible, watered down, salty, pasta falling apart from sitting so long. Spinach with Garlic and Olive Oil was super salty with burnt spinach and garlic. My man ordered a chicken dish and he like half a piece of chicken.",1
"This place is H U G E! Aisles and aisles of possible treasure. Every turn you make is a surprise. Overall I found the prices on the stuff I was looking for to be very reasonable. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable too. Since their inventory changes constantly, if you don't find your diamond in the rough today, come back tomorrow! I for for one can't wait to get back!",2
"I love this place cool and mellow with DELICIOUS snacks! Ordered the mac and cheese bacon bites OMG and I'm not even joking when I say that the Garbage Fries are the best thing I have ever eaten! The fried pickles were just okay, skip them and eat more fries Sat outside by the fireplace at night.so cute.",2
I have been without gas for 5 days! And when I called they said they were blacked out and there is nothing they can do! What the heck! Hire more technicians because that is very unprofessional! Having hot water an a stove an oven that work is a necessity an you people dont care about your customers! This is ridiculous!,1
"Dog was going crazy and me and my boy were blamed, when I tried to explain I was then told I was at fault by the manager even though we were behind the barrier they put up. My boy wasn't doing anything but looking at the dogs. I understand they are concerned about the animals first as they should be but because of the way an animal was acting we we're not welcome.",1
"Had a great experience at this food establishment. This was around Happy Hour, was quiet and peaceful. It was in the middle of the week on a Tuesday, maybe that is why the waitress were very helpful, only a handful was there. Everything was given to me in a timely matter and service and food was excellent.",2
Great happy hour bar and nice staff. nWhen I needed a last minute reservation for some clients they worked me in even though they were extremely busy that night. When one of my client's dinners wasn't cooked as ordered the waiter offered to bring another but since time was short that wasn't going to work so they comped his dinner drinks. Great place to dine in downtown Phoenix.,2
"Perhaps the only people who go here are so thoroughly prepared for the experience that they are always pleased, but I found the place nauseating. The food is so excessively greasy, fatty and unhealthy that is makes feel ill to think about it. The place and the patrons seems to celebrate that, but that's just hard for me to understand or appreciate.",1
"I've visited three times, once for drinks, another time for dinner with a friend, and another time for lunch with a friend. The food is creatively designed, artfully presented, fairly priced, and tasty! The service is friendly, attentive, caring, knowledgable, skilled and unobtrusive. I will definitely be back!",2
"Took mom there for Mother's day and it was a mistake. They were not prepared for the crowd they had that day. There were not nearly enough tables and first come first serve, waited in line after line negotiating food orders and drink orders. They told us an hour and it was over 2 hours before the food was ready. Overall a big disappointment.",1
"The plumber I had to work with was extremely unreliable. Several times this person has stood me up and wasted my time. The plumber I was passed off to call is not good at getting back to me at all, even after I call several times. It's sad this company had to lose so much money because of a lack of care for my business and for the unreliability of it's employees.",1
"Being from Texas and married to a huge PBR fan, we had to stop here. We were seated quickly for lunch, which was nice since most places had a wait. We were greeted promptly and had wonderful service. nOur food was good, I definitely recommend the chili tater tots. Food and drinks were fairly priced for Vegas. Check in on Yelp! and receive a free alcoholic beverage.",2
"The food is average at the best, especially for the price. Between myself and my party we had the ribeye steak, kung pow chicken, fried rice with pork, and the sea bass. The sea bass was the only thing good.oh and donuts dessert was Horrible!. I can't believe how many people give this place such a high rating.",1
"Worst service ever. The popularity just went over their heads. The cooks treat you like they are the owners. They're good but I don't think I want to wait 30 minutes just to eat the tacos. You ask for adobada and by the time you get in line again to get asada or tripa, waste of time. Your first tacos are already cold by the time you seat down and eat. Thanks but no thanks.",1
"Well this place could definitely use a facelift. The service was super slow and unmemorable. At least the food was pretty good, but I can think of a handful of other family owned Mexican restaurants that are much better. My boyfriend didn't like his meal of a taco and chile relleno, I believe. Glad I gave it a try, but probably won't be back.",1
"Portofinos is excellent! I was very lucky in that I was introduced to portofino's right away when moving down from NYC. No prolonged search for great Italian food, it's right there at Portofino's! I have two words for you Stuffed Eggplant. This dish haunts my dreams and my mouth will water out of the blue for it. I'm gonna have to stop in and get some after this review .",2
"I thought about giving this place 3 stars until we ate at Tony Romas and realized that their BBQ just wasn't that good. Not that I wouldn't return but I'd much rather go someplace else. nMy pork ribs were meaty but dry and not very tender. The fried okra was very old and soggy, with the coating all destroyed. nThe honey butter was good and so was the service.",1
"I stopped going to this location years ago because of the bad customer service and because it felt dirty. I heard they had a remodel and it's been years since I've gone in, so I gave it a shot. It still felt dirty and most of their produce was very ripe or old. I ended up walking out and went to my number one go to place, Sprouts.",1
"Ordered a fuel line, put it on and 2 days later it bursts and leaves me stranded on the highway bridge. Ordered an OVP relay and it didn't work. These guys sell garbage fake parts and I now just buy used Mercedes Benz OEM parts on Ebay and car parts.com and the used parts are 100 better than these Chinese knock offs. You've been warned. This is the LAST place I'd go for parts.",1
"Stayed here for our 11 11 11 wedding, just us two . Loved it. Rooms are so cute, big, clean, an good prices. Super quiet. Good location, just walk through the main casino and out to Fremont street. Even the shampoo and conditioner are good! That never happens! And check out is not until noon. We will stay here every time we visit.",2
"Continued service problems. Nearly impossible to get service at an empty bar on a Sunday evening. Nearly impossible to pay the bill at the bar. Strange, occasionally over effusive, service once seated for a late dinner. Excellent food. I had the tuna tartare and the pork chop. Excellent salt caramels, as always.",2
"Wow, I don't come out to Downtown Mesa too often, but found this gem on Main Street. I had the most perfect Turkey Club Sandwich there on this recent trip. Customer Service was just awesome, they were cheerful and very helpful. I'm definitely going to try this place again for dinner and I hear they host some special events.",2
"This hotel customer service is going down fast. The service at the counter is really bad, staff's attitude is extremely terrible! Their knowledge of checking customer in and out is lacking. Room is not available even after 3 PM. The room is with kitchen but nothing is provided except two water glasses, not even mug! Don't waste your vacation by coming here!",1
"This place does exactly what they say. Offer a WIDE variety of nutritional supplements at a discount that I have yet to see in the valley. After being fed up with nutrition ion Rush's terrible customer service and lack of inventory, u decided to give this place a shot. They make NR look like child's play. Saved 20 on my bi weekly supplement run. I will be back and this will be my new spot!",2
"if I could give this place a NEGATIVE star I would! I ordered the Shanghai Beef, was told it would be 1.00 more, they ""padded "" it with a HUGE pile of kung pau chicken. This was for my 3 year old, I saw the beef on top, gave him his food.then I heard SCREAMING! He bit into a pepper.REAL nice Panda REAL nice",1
I will NEVER patronize Taste Cafe again. I don't think I have ever been treated more rudely anywhere than what I experienced this morning. I'll never spend another dime at Taste either personally or for business catering. Hope their shoulder shrugging 'who cares' attitude filled staff does well with no customers.,1
Definitely a top choice when visiting Montreal's gay village! My friends and I make at least one visit here on each trip! Their brunch is TO DIE FOR and their champagne cocktail menu has flavors I never expected! I had a white cranberry mimosa and couldn't get enough of it! DELICIOUS! Staff is always very friendly and bilingual! Will be back soon!,2
"Is not quite Matt's Big Breakfast, but the kids love it chocolate chip pancakes and the wait is manageable. The breakfast menu has everything on it you could ever want. I'm a fan of the spinach and feta omelettes.just be prepared for all the food that comes with them. And make sure you get plenty of those hash browns.",2
"An interesting selection between healthy and hearty xD. The vibe and service is great and friendly. The menu overall is unique and with some witty, funny names xD. Great place for some free delicious, fruit water. The dishes are done very well with a nice presentable, arty feel to them. Try it out because there's something for everybody for a decent price!",2
"This place is the best. Lilac has been taking care of my boys for over 5 years now, even before Elite Grooming. It's great that she has her own place now. She's really good with my dogs and is flexible with scheduling. I prefer using local business I think that pets get better get better care and attention in an intimate environment. And they're LGBT friendly.",2
Found the urgent care on yelp. It was 8 30pm when we left the house after my mother 60 years old took a horrible fall. We pulled up at 8 45pm and no one was in site and the doors was locked. What the hell is the point of having hours posted if you don't keep them! This isn't like I couldn't get a cheeseburger! This is my mother!,1
Restaurant direkt am Sportgel u00e4nde des SSC. n Hier kann man direkt nach dem Sport noch mit Freunden zusammensitzen und eine Kleinigkeit essen. Der Service ist fix zur Stelle und das Essen in der Regel sehr gut die Pommes schmecken mir pers u00f6nlich nicht so gut . n Im Sommer hat draussen ein kleiner Biergarten ge u00f6ffnet. Des Weiteren wird auch ein Mittagstisch angeboten.,2
"went once and that was enough for me. the waitress was snotty and not at knowledgeable when asked if the seasonal brew was hoppy, she said no and looked at me like i was crazy. the beer was extremely hoppy, of course. she ignored us once she found out we weren't ordering food and the beer was mediocre and overpriced.",1
"This business is great in a crisis, I lost my car keys and had a million things planned for the day. One including taking family to the airport, I called and told them my story and they made very fast arrangements due my crisis and came right out. If your having a car key made ask for Todd and they will do awesome work. Great business and very understanding!",2
"Atmosphere is good, especially the patio. Food was ok, came out cold. Not sure if it was the kitchens fault or the waitress. Service was deplorable. I usually go to Blue 32 which is next door, but the wait was too long that night so I thought I would try Harvey American. Next time I will wait it out at Blue 32.",1
"I have had a couple good experiences here, but after going here yesterday I will never return to this location again. I feel like I was ripped off, misinformed, and my time wasted for no reason other than that the employee who rang me up didn't want to put the time in to help me and instead sent someone much less experienced to help.",1
"This is the cleanest and most professional nail salon I have ever been to in Scottsdale. They invest in flirty, fresh, and seasonal polishes to stay on trend. It is a relaxing environment too, which is not always the case with their competitors. I come to support their owner, and my neighborhood along with getting the best pedicure and manicures in town .",2
I only enjoyed the 360 view of Las Vegas. We asked for medium rare ribeye and we got medium. I didn't enjoy the salmon wrapped with prosciutto and sage because the salmon wasn't fresh but what was I thinking it's in the middle of the desert! Lobster omelet was decent. Raspberry and dark chocolate tart wasn't very good.,1
Wonderful place. Love that you can check in and leave your number. They text you when ever your table is ready so you don't neeed to wait in front of the resturabt for hours. The beer I tried was the Innis and Gunn. Props to the waiter for suggesting it. It is an amazing beer from Scotland. I recommend that if you are a fan of tap beer.,2
Wow what an awesome event! Took the kids and headed over to Tryon for the parade. Delighted to see so many participants and a huge crowd. There were bands and big name companies in the parade as well as churches and local groups. My only complaint was that i didn't know my company was marching! I wanted to join! So fun and a beautiful day. Can't wait for next year!,2
"I was turned off by the smell as I entered. Kind of a damp musty smell. nThe biggest turn off by far though was the pre formed of the ""store bought "" variety, nTaco shell. In a Mexican restaraunt that makes killer tamales.REALLY? nThe beans tasted like the canned refried beans, although they might not have been. nI probably will not return to that location at least.",1
"This place is so cool! I love the atmosphere, it was like walking into a big house party. We sat outside on the big beautiful porch, I love the general seating, just grab a menu and have a seat! Delicious beer selection and foods you won't find just anywhere. The scotch eggs are probably the most unique thing I've had there, very yummy.",2
"Great quick healthy food salads that also leave you satisfied unlike many other salads that you may still be hungry after eating! We had the chopped veggie salad which was perfect and the quinoa salad, also good but we lke the chopped veggie better. nPomo pear lemonade was tasty too. nWould come back for sure!",2
We love this place! Happy hour twice a day and it's open late night! We always sit at the bar because we love the bartenders! Marcus and Tomas are awesome! Ask Tomas for his famous lemongrass Siracha shot sounds weird but they're soooo good . Oysters are 1 each during happy hour too. Great beer selection and amazing service!,2
"The only vibe I get from this bicycle shop is a condescending, snobby, you're wasting my time bullshit vibe. Techs seem bothered when you ask for assistance or advice. I'm saving up for a new bike and trying to keep my old one in working order in the meantime but all I get from them is attitude. Sorry vibe but I'll be spending over 2k on a bike elsewhere.",1
"Visited the store yesterday sept 25, 12 to see about switching over from AT T Signed in and waited and waited. Told the girl who signed me in that I couldn't wait any longer and she merely deleted my position and said goodby! Lol. I then went over to AT T and bought the new iPhone from them. Maybe I went to the wrong Verizon store!",1
Food is always delicious! I had the same server a few weeks apart and she remembered me and what I had ordered. Wish I could have remembered her name because she was the best server I have ever had. The service is always good and their menu has a wide selection of things. Never a disappointing choice to eat here.,2
"Romantic place to take your loved one to at night! My hubby brought me up here for my first time and boy was it breathtaking! If you come here during fall, I'd recommend to bring your jacket because it does get a bit chile up there at night. The view of the strip is spectacular along with the Bellagio water show. This is definitely a romantic spot to bring your date to! ",2
"Review for the weekend buffet only. This place is friggin expensive for sure. I would never do a proper meal here cuz the price scares me so much. However.the weekend buffet is pretty good. Although the selections aren't as deep as Tamba or Gandhi, the quality of the food definitely makes up for it. White meat chicken.can you believe it?",2
"The brunch was divine mouth watering pork, fried sweet potatoes, and bread that could have been manna sent from Heaven. If I could, I'd be here every weekend. The waiter who was from Peru told my fianc u00e9 and me all sorts of stories about his homeland, its traditions and its food. Definitely one of the best brunch experiences I've had in Phoenix!",2
"The food at Citizen Public House was some of the best I have had in a long time. As a gluten free eater I often have to settle, but CPH had some of their best options that were completely gluten free, including two dessert items and neither one was ice cream or creme brulee. Our server was also incredibly attentive and informative helping us pick great cocktails and providing his recommendations.",2
"It's more like a shoe farm than a carnival a lot of uninteresting shoes in large quantities. I was really excited when this place opened up because there are not enough shoe stores in the world. I've been in several times and it's always a let down, I think they need to get a new buyer before they go belly up.",1
I take my MIL here for a monthly pedicure. She is pushing 90 and the ladies are so respectful and sweet to Mom. She really likes Laurie to do her nails and she is very proud of them afterwards. The price is very reasonable and they always have a trendy color for me and an appropriate one for Mom. She likes a little pampering.,2
"Great location. Great Food. Great Price! nIf you're tired of paying 80 bucks on the strip for lunch, check out this place. nService is quick, portions are MASSIVE and prices are extremely reasonable. Been coming here for a few years now and have had a variety of items on their menu and it's always been delicious. Give it a try.",2
"Shame on you Rachel's Kitchen for letting this location fail. Bad reviews all over the place you'd think you'd do something to fix it. 30 minute ticket time is AWFUL. Staff is rude. I've been here a handful of times because its a mile from my house, everytime I leave angry. This is a perfect example of why some restaurants shouldn't franchise.",1
"The experience was fairly decent, despite the LONG check in line and no fridge in the room. The kicker however was the power tripping security guard who would not let me communicate with my Mom or 88 y.o. Grandmother while I was holding my toddler since we were somewhere near a slot machine. Really, someone else can hold the baby?! Awful logic!",1
You want to know how I know they didn't make my drink sugar free? Because I'm pregnant with gestational diabetes and I always order a sugar free vanilla or Carmel latte and after I drank my latte this morning my blood sugar was through the roof. Not only is that outrageously dangerous for me but it's life threatening for my baby. Thanks a lot.,1
"Great atmosphere, fun place. As you'd expect by the name, Tex Tubb's is decked out all Texasy. I like ordering a Shiner Bach on tap, they serve it extra cold! My favorites are the fish tacos and the flautas. I gave it 4 stars because even though they've got some tasty items on the menu, there's some pretty blah ones as well.",2
"Typically I would write a detailed review, but I'm too tired and too annoyed with getting suckered into trying restaurants based on raving reviews that are completely over hyped and off the mark. Here is Giada in two words over priced and mediocre. If you can't get reservations to this place we tried for 6 months before getting in don't feel bad you are missing nothing!",1
I had a great chiropractor in Colorado and when I moved back here I didn't think I would find someone as good. I was wrong! The staff is so friendly and dr. Reiss is great! I'm feeling so much better with my neck and shoulders and over all. If your looking for someone who really cares check them out! I'm really glad I found them!,2
"Firearms are very fairly priced but working with whoever it was who helped me seems like the only employee there, actually was a total nightmare. He was very short with me and not helpful at all. The phone prompt, website, and signs all had misinformation about their financial policies very unorganized. Won't be returning here for future purchases.",1
I called for a almost emergency main drain clog during our remodel of the bathroom they sent out Brian who immediately got in to fix the problem that day he was honest and said that the clog had solved itself and instead of charging us the snaking fee and all that he only charged for his time! He was the very funny and nice and I appreciated his honesty about our pipes !,2
Great local neighborhood place. Small menu and decent beer selection. Usually very crowded for dinner. Have always had great food. Been here several times. The pork chops are my favorite but the seem to be gone from the menu. PLEASE BRING THEM BACK! Good service. Can watch the game in the bar. Prices are a little high but the food does reflect. Pretty pretty good,2
"We had a teppanyaki dinner for 4 here tonight and walked away very happy! Good service, good presentation, friendly staff and great food. You get the usual egg roll, volcano and the choo choo train but that's part of the fun and we all had a good laugh along with our chef. We didn't try any sushi and missed out on the naked girls but we had a great experience and will definitely be returning.",2
"I want to start off, I love Target. Throw a SUPER in front of it OMG! This Target is rated 4 starts because I am not loving the lay out. It is a little confusing in the toilertries comestics medicine air fresheners area. I had to go and forth a few times. It is big, clean, well lit, large selections, and just SUPER!",2
"My husband and I were craving gyros so we stopped by for lunch with our son, it was quiet and empty when we first stepped in, there were only two mean having lunch as well so we were a bit worried, we ordered the lamb and beef gyros, loved their Tzatziki, compared to most places, it was the best! Next time we're in the neighborhood we'll give some of their other plates a try!",2
"Not real impressed. When you go here don't be hungry. By the time you get your food, you will be. Once our food came it was cold. I watched 2 womeear us waiting for their food as long as we did. They screwed up their order 3 times. On the bright side the tea was good except they over charged us for it. This was my 2nd time here. Doubt there will be a third",1
"We love the food here, but to be honest, we won't be going here again. We waited an hour for our personal pizzas, it was freezing, it is extremely loud and the service is sub par. We had to wave down another waiter for our check, and even that took forever. Honestly, this place needs a quicker and more efficient way to cook the pizzas. Waiting an hour is not acceptable.",1
Everyone and their mom goes here for lunch. Why? Because they are so delicious! their sugar cookies are out of this world. The sandwiches n are always a good choice if you don't want to go get greasy food. The only thing that bothers me is how pricey they can get but if you want good food then you pay for it!,2
"The food here is great, the owner is friendly, and the beer is cheap 1.10 bottle Thursdays . These are the best pierogies that I have found in Pittsburgh. The Red or White plates come with other Polish sides, come with plenty of food, and are well priced. I've been back, and plan on going as much as I can while I'm in town.",2
"DO NOT EAT HERE! The food is microwaved and tastes like it came out of a box. Yes, they have homemade tortillas, but the stomach ailment you suffer from after visiting here is totally not worth it. Even the drinks are watered down and the place is full of viejitos. Instead, take a short drive to Cuco's on Buckeye Rd off of Stoughton and ask for Diana. She makes great margaritas ",1
Was this awful or what? I have never ate at a worse diner! Table was sticky when I asked for cloth she ran across once with dirty towel and still sticky and wet! Only people in place and waited a long time for food! The French fries were so salty! Tea had refrigerated taste with very little ice! I will never return!,1
"Their mole chicken was amazing and HUGE! Again, if I wasn't staying at the hotel on business, I would have packed that bad boy up for lunch the next day. The chicken was cooked perfectly crispy skin and juicy on the inside. I'm a big fan of Mary Sue and Susan, so I will visit their restaurants any chance I get. So far, I have not been disappointed.",2
"I had gotten a Restaurant.com coupon to try SoHo. I am so glad I did! Lunch was delicious! The Dumplings and Lemon so Balsamic salad with Salmon fabulous! The young guy that waited on me was adorable. So very personable, nice and fun! Is that So? I got there too late to try the rice dishes. But, will come earlier next time for lunch. Am looking forward to coming back very soon. ",2
"We have eaten in and taken out several times. The owners are very friendly. While we were waiting for take out one night, they gave our daughter an appetizer to curb her hunger. It was so good, we had to take some to go! Each time we have been there, the food has been excellent. Last night's Tom Ka Gai was delicious!",2
"Zoo habitats are not kept well, animals walking around in their own feces and a baby alligator had no food or water in his cement cage. There's more birds than anything and all the animal cages are too small given the size of the animal. The zoo is right next to an Airforce base and the zoo doesn't even offer a military discount for their WAY overpriced tickets 35 adult ",1
Rip offs. My boss insisted I take my car to Blackwell. 1100. Later it was worse nBack next day. They said blown head gasket. Wanted addional 2200.00. I picked it up. Shop Owner asked for 1st dibs if I sell it. Took to Pete Kellys Automotive. Two fouled plugs and overflow leak. 400.00. Woman stay away. Thanks Pete Kellys,1
"I have very little faith in chain restaurants. Panda Express lunch was really bad. nNoodles overcooked, choppy, wasted, flavorless. I chose a ""Grilled Chicken "" which was 70 chicken fat bits with a few pieces of some kind of breast or muscle like tissue. Grilled steak something with some vegetable was leather. Its just not good. nFact is there ain't nothing good to eat in 85027 unfortunately.",1
"I kid you not, I saw a female employee in the bakery open up a package of cookies, offer them to children standing nearby, and as soon as another child approached, she slammed the lid shut and put the cookies under the counter and just stared at the little kid like ""I will eat your face if you come any closer! "" The little kid turned around and ran away looking scared, and so did I.",1
"Sorry I just made this account even though I told the person working the deli I would leave a review the next day, it's been 3 months. Well I remember how it tasted. Amazing if you ask me. Four and a half stars if it existed. I would give five if it was a sole eatery so the atmosphere is split. Go here if you want some Italian goods and a fresh tasting sandwhich.",2
"We were staying at a hotel down the street and planned to have our first French dinner at this place. We arrived about an hour before the posted closing time and upon arrival we were told they were closed. We walked around the neighborhood looking for somewhere else and on the way back, saw new people being served, seated in the window, who hadn't been there before.",1
"Went here on Memorial Day weekend, and like other reviews, it was terrible. We paid 55 for lunch, and the only thing that was any good was the brisket. Everything else tasted like leftovers, or maybe it was just sitting out far too long. We also wanted to get unlimited mimosas, but apparently, this buffet doesn't offer unlimited mimosas on holiday weekends. Tip Go to Wicked Spoon instead.",1
Great neighborhood bar. Fantastic wings but make sure to ask for them super extra crispy. Fresh rotation of beers on tap although they could use a larger a selection. The menu is OK but it can be a bit light if you want something other than burgers or sandwiches. Best part is the staff and local people. Mark is probably one of best bartenders in the city.,2
"Yes it is possible to buy legal crack in Summerlin. The popcorn here is amazing. The cornfetti popcorn is so addictive. If It's in the house, I cannot rest until its all devoured! Their other flavors are really great too and I can't wait to try more of them. They do offer free samples as well. Also the service is super attentive and really friendly!",2
"Good size Ralph Lauren store, with solid mix of various RL lines Polo, Sport, Purple Label, Black Label, etc. Although The Shoppes at the Palazzo can be a bit snooty overall, the staff here tends to be more down to earth Chris M. was especially great helpful and nice . This mall also tends to be a bit slower, so you can often find great deals here at the end of sale times.",2
"I tried the everything bagel with salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes and capers. It was the best bagel I've ever had. It's also the only 11 dollar bagel I've ever had. Service was great, they accommodated my group of 5 on a very busy Sunday. It was a good brunch, sangria, bloody Marys and tons of bagels. Very close to a 5 star rating.",2
"I was looking for a place that served breakfast instead of paying for breakfast at my hotel Uptown or going to some chain restaurant. nThis was a great find on Yelp! nI had two pancakes, hash browns, turkey sausage and eggs! The food was great and the 4 mimosas were good also! I arrived shortly afternoon on Sunday the wait was about 20 minutes and definitely worth it!",2
"They don't know how to pair vodka with their caviars. Unless it is already in the pairing flight menu, which they probably asked a consultant to create, don't ask the staff to think or know anything about food and drink pairings. It felt like being served by some very nice but very local yokel college students.",1
"This is the hole in the wall Mexican joint of my dreams. Good value, clean, a salsa bar and pretty good too. The 1.99 fish tacos on special were quite large. The fish was decently crisp on the outside and tender on the insides. It was dressed nicly with the pico and salsas. For a real kick try the roasted Serrano chilies at the salsa bar they are quite warm. I salute you Senior Taco!",2
"There's not much to say about Honey Bears BBQ. The food is not as tasty as the smell I sense every early Saturday morning, it lacks seasoning. The location is a little sketchy, but is very clean inside the premises and the family staff are very polite. Personally, the chicken is better than the ribs. But I only went there once doubt it I will go back.",1
"How can I say no to Nordstrom? I can't. They thanks god! carry Marc Jacob Bags, eeek! soo happy! their service is 99 really nice, but sometime there these young girsl who are really mean scary . But overall they are soo awesome! Love their clothes selection too! and the price isn't that bad in my opinion, since i have a pretty decent job soo xox Nordstrom! ",2
"I honestly don't know why this place has good reviews at all. They're pizzas are gross and inconsistent, the pastas are not fresh and the chicken is like rubber. The service is hit or miss for speed but I have never had an unfriendly experience. This place could be so much better if they just made GOOD FOOD.",1
"Our server, Katie, was very nice. As much as I wanted to try one of their sandwiches, we went in just to have some dessert before our show. Hubby's banana cream pie was delicious and HUGE, and my chocolate mouse cheesecake combo was awesome. Sooo much food that I couldn't even finish my slice, as much as I wanted to. We would go back!",2
Went with five people and had a horrible experience. We all ordered steaks and side dishes and one steak came after 30 minutes. Then after another 30 minutes another came. Then 15 minutes the rest of the meat came. After we were finished eating the steaks our four appetizers came. Food was average and cost very expensive. Would not go again.,1
"Excellent ramen takoyaki. At decent prices as well. Would come back everyday if I can, especially for the takoyaki. I mean it's 4.80! It's a steal! nCustomer service is also a thumbs up. Very well appreciated by the waitresses. They also do bill separation with your pals when you request for it. nAtmosphere is a plus. Might be a bit small but it's still good.",2
"A bit out of the way, but I was craving korean food so I went. The prices are definitely higher than usual for a korean restaurant. The food is sub par, very bland. I had the pork belly and it didn't even have salt on it. Limited side dishes. Maybe the Shabu Shabu, their speciality, would be better.",1
"My dining buddy and I had an early evening meal here last Friday on a Groupon 3 course dinner coupon and could not have been treated better. We had helpful, attentive service and were not at all rushed, despite lingering into the more crowded hours. The food was very good, generously portioned, and nicely presented. We will definitely return.",2
"We always try to find a local business to support and found good reviews on yelp for Pat's Pizza Plus. Geez. I have no idea where the good reviews came from. The pizza had zero sauce on it, it was lukewarm upon pick up and the salad was being stored on top of the pizza so it was lukewarm as well. We won't be trying this place again. We'll stick with Spinato's!",1
The owners need to visit Bern's Steakhouse in Tampa to see how a real steakhouse is run. Steaks are tasty but ours weren't cooked as ordered medium rare and the rest of the food was just so so. Very pricy for a mediocre meal. Service was okay but nothing special. Oysters Rockefeller were good but saut u00e9ed mushrooms were awful. We won't be back.,1
"The great thing about China Wok is it is exactly what you'd expect. It's your decent, standard Americanized Chinese fare. I've never had a bad experience it's always the same. This place is close by me, so delivery is always super fast. Although the food is generally nothing special, the fried dumplings hold an especially, soft, doughy spot in my heart.",2
"Great place if you don't want to actually stay in a room. The rooler coaster is way fun, the design of the building and casino is great and the location is perfect. Just the rooms suck. I stayed at a suite here one time and it was a complete disaster. Go for lunch, gamble, ride the coaster then leave.",1
"Hands down worst service that I have ever experienced. Took about 20 minutes to get soup, not even mediocre soup at that. The order was wrong, our server offered to change it but I was so hungry that I just said it was ok. She looked at me and said, ""it's not a big deal. "" Go back to training and learn what not to say to guests!",1
"Absolutely delicious. The pizza was the best I've had since I was in Rome, and it was served within 5 minutes of ordering. Perfect for hungry girls. We got the Nutella pizza for dessert. chocolatey sweetness that was hard to stop eating. Glasses of wine were large for the average price tag. Our waitress was attentive, but seemed slightly chilly or bored with us.",2
This place is just OK. If it wasn't for the really awesome salsa then I'd say it totally sucked. The guacamole was not good.too tangy or something. The bean dip seemed like it was a can of refried beans poured into a bowl. I'd probably go back to have some more of that yummy salsa and to try something different to see if it could redeem them.but I'm not counting on it.,1
"A fun restaurant, also fun for people watching! Love my salmon dinner, and the desserts were pretty yum. Watch over your kids though, because this restaurant isn't really ""gated "" and therefore little kids can sneak through the side curtains! Had to chase my brothers a couple of times. Also great for a non touristy restaurant atmosphere! 86 those tourists.",2
"Great place. Stopped in on a Saturday daytime. Haven't been here in over a year. Same great service from bar and mgmt staff. Plenty of dancers. Very pretty women. All under 24. 2for1 drink specials still happening, just not with Beefeater. Must choose Tangueray or Bombay. Small buffet lunch still served.",2
"For an AYCE situation, they offer some pretty High End offerings. The salmon and tuna sashimi was my first form of attack. Then a few specialty rolls, which were delish and constantly replenished, but I can't seem to remember at this time. A cup of coffee and a tiny bite of my cheesecake and I off to accomplish more shopping, which makes this location so convenient.",2
"This place had nice beds but they nickle and dime you for everything. No free wi fi, pricey water down drinks, expensive eating places and lousy slot machines. To far from the strip with 20 dollar taxi rides each way. After dark I would not walk around this area, kind of run down and shady. I would never stay there again.",1
"Cheap and easy for when you want slightly better quality than the food court. It suited our needs as we were shopping on the miracle mile. Don't expect a lot, though our meals were definitely frozen and reheated. We had a burger, a salad, and a fish dish . The ambiance is better than the food! If you want better quality try the Italian place directly across or the Brazilian place next door.",1
"Over the top AWESOME. I could go on for pages as to how great this place is. Suffice it to say, electric reclining well spaced comfortable leather seats tells you what you need to know! Plus I love being able to buy particular seats in advance. Simply put, this theater now has 100 of our movie watching business. Literally, I would not even consider going to another theater.it is that great.",2
Disappointing first visit. Yelp sounded great w cool setup. Great setting. Americana etc. but all food was mediocre hash brown looked like it came scooped out of a can and all of it was cold. We came at 10 am yet they clearly left it out on server counter while we waited over 20 mins for our 3 dishes. nOverall maybe this is an exception but wanna be true to a review.,1
"Out of date furniture in the room, not enough variations in the Buffett selections from morning lunch dinner however it was .nice to see they are making an attempt to renovate select areas of the casino floor though. My suggestion is to wait on this place about a year when all of the projects are complete",1
"Really.? You dont allow strollers in the hotel? Oh my mistake, YOU DONT ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARENT STAYING AT YOUR HOTEL TO USE STROLLERS IN YOUR HOTEL! HOW LAME CAN YOU BE? I come in to eat at your buffet with my family and friends and you have this stupid rule? The only hotel in Vegas that does this. Im disappointed.",1
"Cozy little spot with nice staff, laptop friendly looking out on the park, magazine rack in the back and no sense of rush. I'm happy here, but kept from the 5 stars by a filter cup of coffee that's a little weak for my taste. And I don't remove stars for terrible art, but if I did, let's say Meh. Super meh.",2
"I really wanted to like this place after being told this was one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town, and the staff was very friendly. But I found the food to be overpriced and one note not the myriad of complex flavors that I associate with great Vietnamese food. Maybe I ordered the wrong dishes. Personally I think Ben Thanh or Truc are much better.",1
"Terrific find. Ahn and her husband run this place. Friendly, efficient and instead of trying to fit every walk in, they actually honor a schedule and ask you to call ahead. They respect your time, do the nicest french manicure using Gel nails I've ever had. It's a winner and I'm concerned about posting because I don't want to be left without appt availability!",2
Okay. normally I like Mitchell's but today they had the Corn Beef and Cabbage Potato special for St. Patrick's Day. Well the cabbage and potato were just boiled with no flavor and the corn beef was lunch meat probably cooked agaiow has lost all flavor. I was so disappointment. And I hate spending money on food that just is not good. Sorry. Thank goodness I had hot sauce and pepper.,1
"This is really a ZERO STARS review. 55 from McCarran to Harrah's really? Well it's no wonder since he took the tunnel, went south past Mandalay Bay, then the Freeway way up north past the Fashion Show Mall. He didn't say a word the whole trip even after calling him out on his scam. This is the first and last time I will ever take a taxi in Las Vegas, what a Scam.",1
"I'm a new vegetarian and love love love this place! It's perfect for vegans as well. I liked it because the first time I went I was transitioning and felt like I was cheating but we wernt! You have go get the general T's chicken. It's probably the best thing that will happen to u. We also got the spring rolls, roti app OMG bomb! Pad thai, tofu dishes,and much more. So so so gooood!",2
It feels very out dated at the Luxor. Like you walked in the 90s. It needs updating. The hotel is clean no problems there. The high def tv's don't even have high def tv to watch like to watch tv before bed . It is convenient if you want to spend time at Mandolay Bay.which we did. Our friends were only charged a 35 fee for a 3pm checkout.I didn't even think to request one.but should have.,1
"If you've been to one self soft serve yogurt store, you've been to them all. That is unless you go to Menchies where they offer REALLY soft serve. Both times we tried this place the yogurt was more like thick soup than frozen yogurt. Yes we got the Yelp discount, but that was the saving grace for this place which won't be around much longer unless it gets its act together.",1
"Well people, you are right! XS is THEE hottest night club in Las Vegas right now. We stayed at the Wynn and even though we tried to venture out and about to different clubs, we ended up here every single night. The DJ is good, the people are beautiful and the set up of the place is gorgeous! Watch out for the water though, its pretty easy to fall into drunk. XS is definitely the best.",2
"Not your usual magic acts! Lots of amazing illusions that makes you wonder ""how do they do it "", venue was a little smaller than expected and there was more dance performances than I would have expected for a magic show.Jan takes the time to hang out with you after the show which is really nice and unexpected.",2
"AWFUL. Avoid this place all together. It's a far walk from the rooms with TERRIBLE facilites. There is a single hot tub in the facility it's slightly larger than a typical bath. The co ed areas are a nice idea esp. for a couple , but somewhat lame. The wave relaxation area had several non functional chairs. My advice Skip the Canyon Ranch head over to the MGM spa.",1
"Avoid this place. They tried to hustle my girlfriend for a 45 dollar basic oil change. Until I showed up and got a 10 ""discount "" They have false advertisements and constantly change their prices depending on the person who walks in. They need new management or ownership in order to stay in business. I will never return.",1
"Ended up here as Mr. Mama's had a 45 minute wait. This place was just ok. nWe both ordered the 2 egg special with our eggs ""over medium "" they came sunny side up. While the cook may have been at fault, the server should notice and take it back. Their home fries are weak and mine were cold. Service was friendly. Saw a couple just up and leave when their order arrived, incorrectly.",1
"Can't believe I have not been to this place in all these years. Good spot. Local mom n pop set up. Meat and two type of place. The grilled pork chops were great, and all of the vegetables as well. Casual atmosphere, like the Plaza in general. Great food, personal service. Has a patio out front as well.",2
This place seriously is the only place I will go for a car wash. I had a really shitty experience at the terribles on pecos and windmill and they left my car a mess and no one would return my phone calls to rectify it. I went to this car wash and explained the situation to the manager and he took care of it for free. Everyone was super friendly and my car has never looked better.,2
"Went on yelp to find a Pho place near my home. I found this one and decided to try it out judging by the reviews and rating. Let me tell you that I loved the place. Very clean, fresh, and quiet. I was greeted right away and my order was out in a reasonable amount of time. I would return there again. It is a little pricey compared to other PHo places but it was delicious.",2
"Lunch hour.only 2 tables with clients and I still had to wait 4 5 minutes to get somebody to come out and offer me a table. 17 lunch plus 3 tip for a waitress with no personality. Carne ensebolllada was less than ok. Will not be coming back. Maybe an off day, but honestly fast food started to sound better. Specially for a 20 lunch.",1
Very frustrating experience. Our order was very simple but the cashier couldn't get it right. While waiting for our food I watched the beleaguered manager apologizing to every table. Every customer had a problem with their food or order. We waited twenty minutes for our food and decided to leave. I have never experienced more incompetence. Never again.,1
We got a cold pizza! We told our waiter who wasn't very personable and he said okay I'll take it back and reheat it. When he brought it back to us the edges were piping hot but the center was still lukewarm . So if you want lukewarm microwaved pizza then this is your place. They had maybe 15 other people in there besides us so they were not busy at all.,1
"Nice , big, clean, and lots to chose from. This place has a very nice SCUBA section, and that is hard to find in the desert. I purchased a gift card for a friend and that is why I showed up. Lots of good stuff and a wonderful staff. I live by Dicks so that is where I usually go, but if in the neighborhood I would hit them up.",2
"Extremely poor customer service and do not offer the latest innovations in wigs. Maybe they were once the only game in town and are resting on their laurels.if you have breast cancer, the last thing you need is poor service and pushy sales clerks. I would give no stars if that were an option. Stay away.",1
The first time I went there I had fingernails in my mouth but I gave it a second chance and they never cease to impress me. I love how healthy they are. I always get the bowls for maximum healthiness. Little rice barbacoa both beans guac mild medium salsa and lettuce. I have to say that I am a proud chipotle fan ,2
"If you are looking for stylish trendy boutique pieces from local artisans and designers check out this place. Cheeky Bean stocks its store with pieces made in the USA. The sales associates are so sweet and helpful and are all impeccably dressed like living, walking mannequins . Love the store and love that they stock the store with items made in the USA.",2
"Love This Place Recently tried the Sloppy joe fries with the fried egg on top, AMAZING! nThe shrimp po Boy is Awesome as well With the Thai Clam Chowder a lil spicy but shoot is it good. I totally recommend this place to anyone, don't let the horrible reviews steer you clear of this place, I tend to think they have no palate mature enough for a place like this ",2
"I have NEVER had so much fun at a bar before. Games and drinks and AMAZING music. I'll be coming here again and again! The videos behind the awesome DJ booth are loads of fun, they play remixes of classic video game theme songs, the bar is supposedly themed after Tron. Honestly this is probably my favorite place in Vegas. You'll never get bored there's always something to do!",2
"I love PINK TACO! My favourite place for Mexican food in Vegas. I've tried numerous other Mexican restaurants in Vegas and this place always wins. I love the environment, the servers, and of course the food. The prices aren't too bad considering it's in the Hard Rock Hotel. I've never been during Happy Hour but I really should one of these days.",2
"If hometown buffet opened a casino, this is what it would be like. Paid 25.99 each. For what you paid for, this place just sucks. Dining area is like a high school cafeteria, noisy and drafty. Lots of food varieties cooked to mediocrity. Pro they have beer served in a solo cup like a carnival . nCon they only serve Miller light Here's a tip don't drop your fork because you only get one.",1
"What a depressing shell of a mall. I remember when it was the mall to go to. CompUSA, Pharmor, Kmart, Playless, Joann Fabrics, ChiChis, Giant Eagle. Hell, CompUSA, ChiChis and Pharmor don't even exist anymore. I'm not sure if Kmarts are still in business. Dead malls are sad, for some reason. Walking through this mall just creepy though.",1
"Yayy for pho after a long weekend of partying! I don't think I've ever gone to vegas and not come here on our way back home. The food is good! The service is slow due to so many people and theres always a line which are the only cons to this place. Its not the BEST pho I've ever had, but coming here has turned into a routine after a long vegas trip.",2
"Music is too loud obnoxious and the internet sucks, slow. I love Starbucks but at night this more like a nightclub, but you know without the people. Currently using my phone to tether just to do the homework I can barely do because it is so friggin loud here. But this is just the humble opinion of one gold card holder.",1
"In town for the weekend and myself and three friends decided to grab some Indian food. I'm from England and have eaten Indian food at many nplaces. This is certainly one of the best experiences. Manny our server was fantastic! He was very friendly, outgoing and really catered to our needs When I'm back in town I will 100 return. doit",2
Delicious Dumplings! We got the Pork Soybean Carrot and the Shrimp Pork Mushroom boiled and they were both delicious. The reason I gave this 4 stars is because each order comes with 15 dumplings so you don't get to try many flavors unless you have a large party. I wish they offered a sampler. Perfect dinner after visiting Old Montreal and just a short walk from there to Chinatown.,2
"Really popular place the line was out the door! Even though they were busy and I had lots of questions they didn't rush me and were really friendly. Service was pretty quick too. They make their own cream cheeses you have to try the Bacon Scallion, it is SO good! Nice breakfast sandwiches and mini blueberry muffins!",2
Incredible service and tasty dishes. They have some killer sushi here and it's truly one of my favorites in town. I totally recommend this and you will not be disappointed by anything. Try the spicy Tuna on anything amazing sushi is what they should call this place! Get the fever for the flavor of sushi fever.great sushi bar for singles.,2
"Really tasty. My sweet boyfriend delivered one of these to me and it was the best treat! I had a large white chocolate mocha. It was a wonderful blend of flavors, and the sweetness wasn't overhwhelming. One of my favorite coffee drinks and sooooo worth the calories! 1000x better than Starbucks. I hear the service is awesome. One day I'll have to go in and experience it.",2
"Here for a conference and found myself walking around this beautiful place. Love the Forum shops and the casino floor is so unique. It helps when you are sitting in lectures all day to be able to sneak out for a break and take a few pulls on your favorite machine, or walk though the forum shops browsing for a special item. Someday, perhaps I'll get a room!",2
"I have been here twice. Sandwiches are big, but very greasy. The place feels dirty and the sandwiches basically just taste like grease and cheap bread. Last time I ate there, I got very ill and puked about an hour later. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that is typical, but it is enough to make me not want to eat there ever again. Given the choice between this and Primantis, i'd pick Primantis.",1
"This is a terrible mcdonalds! If you order 4 meals in the drive through, you will have to park and will be lucky if they ever come out with your food, and if you get lucky and they do bring your food out, they always forget half the order. Also half of your order will have sat on the counter while they cook your frys. Service sucks, and management is worse! Don't expect much if you eat here.",1
most of the dishes are basic and tasteless. nothing wow reaction. not a lot of selection. small dessert areas. quality of food is bad . it like the food has been sitting in the heat lamp for hours. the best one was fresh fruit juices but they ran out fast and was told to wait an hour. they don't have a lot of fruits,1
"Food was just ok. Not impressed at all. I was dying to have a good Cuban sandwich, but again I was not impressed. I asked the waitress if the mojito chicken was spice for my daughtet and she said no. Well I love spice food. And that's was pretty spicy! And the mojito. Don't order that.13.59 and worse mojito I have had in my life! Not coming back ",1
This place was SHUT DOWN in 2008 when the franchise owners sued Petland Corporate over the un profitability of selling sick puppy mill puppies. Google it Well apparently the lawsuit got settled because it's back.Same gross place. The only nice thing I can say about it is it has a large parking lot. No I am not paying 1000 for an American Eskimo puppy that might have kennel cough!,1
"I can't review their coffee because the rude salesgirl wouldn't let us buy any. We came here around 7pm on a Friday. The door says they are open until 10. The yelp profile says the same. She was on the phone with a friend gossiping when we came in. We stand there for at least 5mins before she noticed and said ""oh yeah, we're closed. "" wtf?",1
"While staying at the Palazzo, I ended up at this place on more than one occasion and it grew on me. The food is pretty good, and in big portions, but what I liked best was that it was open late and this ended up being the nightcap coffee and dessert spot for my colleagues and I. A great little place to go to in the late evening.",2
"If you are looking for quality ingredients and tasty pizza then look no further. A city hit by the recession has not affected the taste of this pizza. They continue to provide quality east coast pizza at a fair price. Make sure you look for the NY Italian Deli. Roccos Pizzeria in the same part of town is not this place, and you will know by the taste! nBest for take out.",2
"Food was amazing and it's a good thing b c the hostesses kind of sucked. Our 45 minute wait took almost 2 hours and the snotty high schoolers working the hostess stand almost caught a piece of my mind. But thankfully the food and service made up for it. I'd say go earlier or later to avoid some of the rush, especially as the bar area gets jam packed.",2
"Soto Ayam was the best I've had. The broth, which is typically very mild in most Sotos, was flavorful and aromatic, with a strong kick of citrus ginger from the galangal. Beef Rendang was equally flavorful and rich, with a pleasantly spicy dollop of chili sambal on the side could have eaten a whole bowl of it .",2
AWFUL! nThe guy who was doing my pedi left early and another woman finished once she was done doing what she was doing. My gel polish chipped within 4 5 days. I've never had such a terrible manicure! I will never returor will I suggest this place. nThe wait was too long and the fact that they Demanded a tip blew my mind! nOver priced for shitty service and poor quality work.,1
"Service was outstanding! I am so happy I finally found my groomers after a year of bad experiences. My two Yorkies look fantastic. The two ladies who helped me were so kind, friendly, and caring just met me and my dogs and they made me feel as if I've been coming here for years. So kind, thoughtful and accommodating and my dogs just look feel and smell great!",2
"I have visited loved many Michael Mina restaurants, this one absolutely does NOT measure up! Much overrated overpriced for quality of food ambiance.very marginal steak, poor prep, not served as ordered. Terribly LOUD. Free duck fries best item served at this dinner. Would not return. Complete waste of calories!",1
"One of the nicest places in Vegas to sit and relax. The Tea Lounge is a beautiful, peaceful spot for exotic Asian influenced teas and light desserts such as scones and tea cakes. I would have liked more privacy between the tables, as the lounge is basically a wide open space set aside next to the Sky Lobby, but the intent is obviously for all to enjoy to the view. Highly recommended.",2
"Kelly has been my stylist for 5 years. I've followed her to 3 salons and I'm very excited that she's found her personal studio which has an intimate yet fun ambiance. Kelly is a skilled artist and an avid communicator, you will get what you want. For the record, I travel from northern Nevada just to get my hair done by Kelly, the consummate professional who is blessed with positive energy!",2
"Hate getting stuck here when I need to eat. There aren't very many choices and after you go through security the choices get even slimmer. Bluck. However, getting through security generally is better other airports, but that's primarily due to their size. Off site car rental is a drag and adds a lot of extra time. Always seem to be just missing a bus when I return the car and have to wait.",1
"Terrible sushi. We did all you can eat. All the pieces stick to the plate and when picked up they fall apart. AWFUL service! It took me 15 minutes to get a cup of Miso soup. I thought id try a simple CA roll at the end of our meal because I figured it was a simple roll so they couldn't screw it up. WRONG! Again, it fell apart and it tasted like chlorine. DO NOT GO HERE!",1
"Great service, good food, when our group of Downtown Ambassadors met here last night. Plenty of room for our twenty people and no loud music to stop our conversations. I had the Kobe beef on pancakes listed on the Happy Hour menu, which incidentally lasts from 11 30 a.m. To 6 00 p.m. It was excellent and tasty. Good selection to choose from.",2
Good buffet food its fresh and always nice. oh and they have a sushi bar with FRESH sushi and its descent. Its priced preety average also 11.49 on sundays dinner all day thats when I went same food they have at all chinese buffets. Well for some reason everytime chinese buffets get big they start making there shit cheap and nasty so its good.,2
"Nice gelato shop that is part of a pizza Italian restaurant. All the classic flavors are represented here nicely. The chocolate chip mint is great! I've heard that the pizza is ok, but the best thing about this place is the location. If you are with some friends at the sport bars just down the way you can walk to this location.",2
"The rooms are ugly, looks like an old motel room. I'm very annoyed and upset. The sink is out in the open with the room. No privacy. It's just awful, I will be posting pictures. I'm very honest with all my reviews. I was able to pay extra for an upgrade but some people were getting upgraded rooms for much less.",1
"I've gone to Anntony's twice. Both times the food was very good. Juicy tender wings, light and fluffy calypso rice, crispy seasoned fries, flavorful greens and warm moist cornbread. My family enjoys the food the price is fair. I enjoy the carribean sounds of the musicians that play on the weekend. A fun place to frequent. Wish there were more patrons to visit them.",2
This place is a joke they have the worst management!no idea how to initiate conflict resolution between unruley staff and patrons.I saw a contract security guard grab someone by the throat for no reason then push him.Security is outrageous. Stay away from this place by all means! I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE,1
"My fianc u00e9 came here 2 weeks ago while he was in Vegas and he can't stop talking about the fried shrimp po'boy, the blackened shrimp po'boy and the bananas foster. We'll be in Vegas next weekend, so I can't wait to try the food for myself. My family is from New Orleans, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Lola's hits the spot. I'll be back to update my review.",2
Natural products and great smells to be found inside The Body Shop. This location meets my needs since it's close by my home. I think that things are changing because the staff is great any they are always busy merchandising. I am very glad that they are in The Paradise Valley Mall stop by and give them your business.,2
"You know what makes the difference between a good pizza and a great pizza? There are a lot of factors, but I say that one of the big ones is the toppings. Pepi's Pizza has always been a favourite at our house because they put lots of great toppings on the pizza, and they don't skimp! Add to that hot and fast delivery and you've got a recipe for success!",2
"Very lame. The pot sticker appetizers were lukewarm and undercooked, and served with some viscous orange colored goo that managed to have almost no flavor at all. The kung pao chicken was LaChoy ish no heat, no sweet, and the peanuts tasted like they'd been recycled from a zoo cage. All in all a total disappointment. We will not be back.",1
"Delicious steak, arugula, and parmesan salad. The pasta was solid. On a side note, I love Batalli's sauces in the grocery stores! Had a super friendly and nice bartender waitress. Had a friendly waiter who mentioned that LA, Chicago, and Vegas had better food than SF. He's confused and probably should expand his culinary adventures P SF and NYC probably tie for the best food and variety of food.",2
I've driven by this place quite a few times while on 7th ave and decided to give it a try today after my hike. I ordered the 'Surfer' torta and my friend had the steak and shrimp tacos. I have to say that everything was delicious. The torta was definitely tasty. And the service was just as good. I've found a new taco spot and I'll definitely be hitting it up again soon.,2
"I went here with my girlfriend for lunch back in October '07. I had the absolute BEST steak sandwich I have ever had in my entire life! It basically melted in your mouth so moist and juicy! Simply amazing. Unfortunately, I cannot speak about the dinner service as we only had lunch, but I would highly recommend having lunch and a couple beers and watching the fountains at Bellagio.",2
"This is my new favorite dinner spot! Awesome decor and atmosphere. Funky music and lively mood. Very well informed waiters. They were all willing to answer questions and take our order when we were ready. To quote my fav waiter, Jet the food is ""magic in your mouth "" and he isn't exaggerating. The Big Star pizza and the veggie platter were delicious. They're not messing around in their kitchen.",2
"High school girls seating patrons badly, waiters bringing plates and bowls long after the food was served ? . Mundo survives for one reason.only restaurant near Smith's theater. If Smith's would so much as start serving hotdogs and nachos, Mundo would close down. Until then Las Vegas will not have a Broadway class theater. Patrons of the Arts demand culinary choices equivalent to the Playbill.",1
"We went here for a celebration on our first night in Las Vegas and experienced the worst service of my life. First we were informed ten times of the minimum per person charge, after that initial shock we had slow service on the food and poor food quality. I don't think that I will ever eat here again.",1
I did the Corn Maze on a Saturday night last year it was so much fun. I hope to get out here more not just for Halloween. But I am sure the clock is ticking because it is too good a thing and it shall inevitably be sold and replaced by treeless lots of soulless cookie cutter homes or something else that is not nearly as worthwhile.,2
"This place is great. With a full bar, bar seating area, and dining area there is an atmosphere for anyone. I didn't have an entree but the Parmesan crab dip and fried Brie were very tasty. nDef would come back for dinner or lunch again. nAs a side note all of the servers seem to be enjoying themselves which makes for a more light and enjoyable experience.",2
Very good service. Breakfast was excellent. Biscuits and Gravy are my breakfast devining rod and the ones I got here were very peppery and generously laced with sausage. The biscuits were light and flakey. My Brother Bob got the skillet with Chorizo and enjoyed it. Said the chorizo had a bit of a kick to it. Menu says it's homemade. Definitely be back.,2
" Organized inside. Smaller than other Goodwill stores. Filthy, dirty parking lot.small too. Rugged with pot holes. YIKES! Good prices. Friendly employees. It's hit or miss on what treasure you might find at this location. Park on the north or south side of the building the entrance faces west. Handicap parking is on the north. I have been in this Goodwill many times and have NEVER found anything.",1
Great German food here. Nice selection of beers. The waiter was very informative and answered all of our questions. We tried the Vienna Style Schnitzel and the Pretzel Dumplings with Mushroom Sauce. Both were delicious! We especially enjoyed the fried potatoes with the schnitzel. The apple strudel was great for dessert. One suggestion is to have suggested beer pairings with the entrees.,2
The staff here is wonderful the food is good especially when looking for a light lunch. nIt's usually filled with the trendy or super nerdy. You see the soccer mom that still trying to hold on. But besides all that the good is good and fresh. I really enjoy the baked goodies over here. Also got great rewards program,2
"Yummy! If you like filipino food this place is like eating in your aunties kitchen.down to the plates and silverware. Kawali is yummy, kare kare is awesome.shanghai lumpia is a thumbs up! The bakery is a visual stimulation! If you're feeling like home cooked food but don't want to slave in the kitchen.definitely worth the stop.",2
Seriously. This place is awesome! Every time I am in Vegas I have to come here. I can't stay away! There are so many other good restaurants around here but I just can't help it. My husband and I were in Vegas for only 2 days and we came here TWICE! What the hell do you guys put in this pizza!?!? Crack? nHell. It's even good the next day when it is cold. Stupid crack pizza.,2
"Worth the drive! We've eaten at some of the finest Japanese restaurants, this rivals the best.The pairing of flavors and presentation was exceptional.Our server, Mika sp? was knowledgeable and guided us through the menu with great suggestions. Don't expect the strips high end decor frills.This place is casual.",2
"Always a good time watching football, having a couple craft beers. Pumpkin Spice Ale and Octoberfest! A very tasteful mix of weather changing aromas and warm flavors. Happy hour with mini pizzas and other specials going as we watch the morning games. You caever go wrong with the triple chocolate ghirradelli pizookie!",2
"Not like I remember it.I think perhaps my fettish was with the Golden Vanilla.and all they had was regular vanilla, bit the consistency and flavor were not good. Bland and uber creamy, like chemicals had been added. There are better yogurt places out there now. What happened TCBY? 2 stars for the good service.",1
"So last night we ventured out to Garcia's for my favorite dish. pollo Monterrey. I love that dish, well, I did. they changed the recipe, some red pesto and too many tomatoes, very watery. Didn't taste good and presentation was awful, just thrown on the plate. bartender informed me they changed food vendors so the food changed. obviously not home made. Very, very disappointed.",1
"Why would I go to Todai when there are so many other buffet options in Las Vegas? Well, because I had a free pass to go there. Todai was actually a refreshing change of pace to the heavier fare that is common on the strip. Its Todai. Lots of Asian food and lots of cheap sushi. It's not bad, but it's not good. I wouldn't go back if it wasn't free.",1
The display of everything was soo amazing. The chocolate fountain i posted on instagram got lots of likes haha The gelato was what i was able to taste and it was delicious. They also had cute little pastries and desserts that were presented beautifully. Definitely would come back next time I'm in Vegas.,2
"Definitely one of the highlights of Downtown Las Vegas. Art, Events, and Culture.all in one spot. This is the center of the Art Universe in Las Vegas. I'm glad it's here and I will always support it when I can. Today I went to Beerfest, which was a great event and I had a lot of great tasting beers. My favorites were the IPA's from Tenaya Creek and Joseph James brewery. Will I return? You bet!",2
"this was our 1st stop the night we went to vegas.thats wat set our mood the whole time we were there, cuz ppl were sooooo nice, this hot guy approached us and said u ladies r with me!.he walked us to moon and we ended up in vip with these guy who were loadedddd.we just had a great night.we felt like celebs,.it was weird kinda neat lol",2
"I guess now it is the customers responsibility to have the pricing when you go to the register. nWent to the register with a product, cashier could not find the price in the register so she told me I would need to pay for my 30 products and then go to the nursery to get the price of the item she could not find? nWTF nHorrible service!",1
"Love it. Been coming to the Hole in the Wall for years!. The free flowing house wine is great! This great local spot is so comfortable in its skin, no pretense, no bravado . Just a great atmosphere, solid service and good comfortable food. Expect a wait most nites, but grab a seat in the bar and get some wine and great starters. Oh. Come hungry!",2
"I've been here a couple of time for drinks and this past Vegas trip for food. Their carne asada was really good, but I wasn't that hungry so I couldn't even eat half the plate. Prices are not cheap. It may look like a mexican fast food place, but it's not. Drinks were good. The bartender was really nice. I'd come here again.",2
"I have used Jerrod Roberts, owner of Paint Worx for 10 years and he and his crew consistently do an amazing job for my personal painting needs and for my clients. Paint Worx is dependable, reasonable, friendly, trustworthy and does a great job with paint, color choices and light remodel. I highly recommend Paint Worx, you will not be disappointed. nLarry Gurganus nRealtor nAward Realty",2
My favorite dessert is mud pie and we picked this place for my birthday dinner because they have mud pie on their menu on their website. Lo and behold THEY DON'T HAVE MUD PIE! How frickin' hard is it to keep your website up to date. It's the 21st century. Not sure what else is fiction on their website but if you think you're getting it because it's on the website better call and verify.,1
This website is a rip off and a scam. Do not waste your money on this and save it for a show you would like to go to. Everything good mysteriously sells out and other then that you have comedy shows that are nameless acts. I regret paying for this and suggest you take my advice and spend your money elsewhere.,1
sorry amber. your service sucked. that's why I stiffed you and told you to your face. just because you have tits does not mean you get a tip . I don't believe in leaving a small tip when service is bad. when you do that servers just call you cheap. i'm a great tipper when I get great service. I didn't get it from you. I left you nothing because that's what you earned.,1
"So sorry to have to update this review, but the last few visits have been less than wonderful. The last time we were there, which is probably the ""last "" time, my salad was wet runny, sparse, and overpriced given the quality. It's also taken for ev er to have food prepared. I know, it's a small kitchen, so there's that. I'm no longer a fan.",1
Well I give this place 2 stars just for the fact that my boyfriend and I did not have to wait in line or pay and then maybe add 1 2 a star for the music mostly booty popping hip hop. But like allot of people on here say they do just let anybody in here. Let's just say an older un attractive demographic. Will most likely not be back do your self a favor go to XS,1
Great service. nGood food. nI ordered something a little off the menu. I had the chile relleno but had them add the carne adobada instead of the regular shredded beef. Turned out to be a great choice. nI think this may be my go to place for day drinking. They have a full bar. nMy birthday is on Saturday so it might be a great place to start the day. nGo!,2
"The ambience was very nice with a pretty cool band was playing, the salmon panini we was pretty good but why it only received two stars? We ordered which perhaps is the worst pizza I've ever had! I'm not a picky eater by any means but they should seriously take it off the menu, I've had better frozen pizzas!",1
"Great Food Service, No Frills! This place is wonderful for a quick sandwich, soup, or pickle during your lunch break. I had their Turkey and Avocado sandwich and it left my mouth watering long after the sandwich was gone. They also have a great selection of Dr. Brown sodas as well as the normal fountain selection .",2
Well this rating is going down. This location is always out of breakfast sandwiches. Like they had the classic sausage and cheddar sandwich literally once the last ten times I tried to buy it. nThe frustrating part is that I drive less than a mike to the much busier locatioext to LVAC and they have have never been out. nSo whoever is doing your ordering. You are losing sales and customers.,1
My husband and I went to this restaurant and ordered food and then come to find out its all tables with booth seating. Me being over weight I became offended knowing that I was not going to fit in the booth. A lady then tried to give me a chair witch was nice but I turned it down because I am not got to give my money to a restaurant that cannot accommodate everybody.,1
"Wow. Looking for a good meal with luxury? Look no further. Fresh small family style servings in Le Creuset pots. Love their napkins, crab, fried pickles. I didn't like the Mexican food station. A tip when it's busy ask to move your table towards the pool when there's an opening. Also, tip them at the door.",2
Service not so good lately. One really nice girl there. But the rest are pretty unkind. They mess up on orders a lot too. I ordered a tuna croissant and got home and it was a turkey yucky sandwich of which I threw away. I called back to tell them and the girl was rude. And I got no apology. Terrible customer service THAT is.,1
"Sometimes it's really hard to do Mexican food fast, fresh, and tasty. I wish I could at least say that they've got the fast part down, but that isn't the case. The place was practically empty and it still took 15 minutes to get two tacos. Food was bland, so I loaded up on salsa and lime juice on top of the tacos. Even Chevy's is better than this.",1
"Was fairly empty. Hostess sat us next to the kitchen anyway. Waiter was preoccupied with conversations with what seemed to be the manager. Forgot to put our order in. Food was really late, with no apology. The food was ok. Pizza is the best thing we ordered. Our bill was 120 for 4 people with a bottle of wine. Not bad but the service and vibe was really bad.",1
How do I start this. Just NO! We went and surprised by a minimal choices of food. Not even appealing.i told my friends we shoulda checked the review before we went here.when I checked all I read is complains.mediocre is the right term for this buffet.go to Paris buffet it is much better! Will never come here again.,1
Major disappointment. I've visited a handful of different LA Fitness' locations in the valley and this is BY FAR the worst one I've been to. I consider LA Fitness to be a pretty solid chain gym and this location is simply not up to par . The gym is small and the equipment appears outdated. Needless to say I probably won't be returning if I happen to be in the area.,1
I was going to go there for lunch but could not force myself to go in after reading all the rules the have in place for the after eight crowd. No excessive jewelry no solid colors no tank tops and the list goes on. When do Toby become become such a controlling Libtard. Almost felt like the Feds were running it. Can't patronize places like that.,1
They took money out of my bank account without sending me a bill ! What they told me is that they emailed me on Jan 2 and the money was going to come out on the 3rd . Well i recieved NO EMAIL and the money came out on the 6th . THEY NEED TO SEND PAPER BILLS IN MAIL NOT EVERYONE CHECKS EMAIL all the time . and whose to say they sent it to the right email ! obviously they didnt !,1
I was really surprised when this anonymous looking sandwich shop sitting right next to the hotel elevators actually provided a really great turkey bacon and swiss on french baguette. Bread was fresh and there was abundant turkey and bacon content. I definitely recommend it if you're staying in Bally's. The prices are a bit high but you get a very large sandwich for what you pay.,2
"This mega chain brewery is nothing to call home about. If you want a cool brewery head to Four Peaks that's where it's at! Gordon Biersch is stuffy, over priced and the servers have attitude. The food is mediocre considering the prices and the bar is ho hum. The highlight? The second floor balcony, which is fun for people watching.",1
"I feel violated. I had a cheeseburger and SMALL drink for 9.60. The burger is large but they put oot even close to being ripe tomatoes on it. After yanking the tomatoes off, I did enjoy the burger. My friend had Cajun fries and they were a oiley, soggy mess. I don't understand the fuss or any type of value here",1
"I had a great experience at this TSA check point. There were plenty of metal detectors and agents on staff to make the screenings move quickly. The agents were relaxed, personable, and speedy. In fact, my screener told my to keep my shoes on. I was in and out in a split second. This was the greatest security screening I've ever been through invasive body and luggage scans have never been so easy.",2
Dr. Glassman was a referral from one of my GP doctors. I was nervous ans didn't know to believe from the moment I stepped in the office everyone made me feel welcome and put me at ease. I just wanted to thank everyone at this office for really going above and beyond for me and I really highly recommend this office to anyone and believe everyone will get the quality care they truely deserve.,2
"Surprising little pizza place. Super friendly staff. Two 16 "" deep dish pizzas done in 20 minutes and they were delicious. The dough was not mushy or dry, it was very pleasant. The sauce had a nice blend of spices and it really made the pizza better. Overall I was kind of impressed. I didn't have high expectations for such a small place, but I'll definitely be there again.",2
"What can really be said about starbucks that hasn't already? What seems to be 10 years ago awesome coffee has turned into todays ""meh. ive had better. "" This is the location inside the safeway. I usually stick to a tea, but if you're looking for coffee close to this area, try Lux on central about .5 miles away.",1
"Great atmosphere and great drinks! This bar is very cool because it has a variety of indoor and outdoor seating. Many different rooms with cute furniture and a pool table. The drinks are wonderful, I would highly recommend the Arizona Mule. I have not tried the food, but have heard great things from others about the food.",2
"I stopped my on my way home from church today. I wanted to have them sand off the top coat from my acrylics, go home, change clothes, soak off my old nails, then come back to have a full new set put on. They wanted to charge me to do that, even though I was coming back for a full service. Ridiculous. I walked out and will never go back.",1
I guess same as any other Bevmo. I had one of the rudest staff member ever. I asked about the etched glasses for beer and it seemed like I was bothering him. He was no help at all. Didn't even try to promote the refillable beer bottles to me when I asked him about those too. Yikes bad customer service!,1
"Their bar food is incredible! Enough said! Decent beer prices and wow the food was great. Coconut shrimp actually tastes like it has coconut and the sauce is great. nPhilly was flavorful, the pizza was decent. Oh man if this becomes my new watering hole, I might be in trouble because the food is just that good. Plus they have interesting nights like Karaoke Taco nights.",2
"My family absolutely loves the pizza and wings! Flavorful, Delicious! My only problem with the place is.it is extremely hot in there. They say the air conditioner is working but we went there last week and it was so hot in there that by the time our food came we did not feel like eating it. It had to be over 90 u00ba in there. Please address the heat problem!",2
"Don't get in these cabs if you value your life. The most wreckless drivers in Vegas. I have been cut off multiple times everyday by these guys. They just want to make a quick dollar. I don't think they care about the laws or any one. The one time I was in their cab, I was afraid for my life. The drive was very rude.",1
"I used to get my smogs here and its always been fast awesome service. I used to drive from Nellis and Boulder Highway to get there, so when I heard about there new Mr. Smog right down the street 4080 east desert inn from me I was happy to go there and he's just has reliable but I think he's a lil quicker though. Excellent company fantastic staff.",2
"This is an excellent place to get wasted while watching sports. I have spent a full 8 hours drinking at Silky's one day. That was a lot of fun. I recomend you try it sometime. nYou will get a good mix of people. Some Tepper studnts, some locals, some drunk underage kids who think you want to fight them. All in all, a good time.",2
"Worst haircut I've ever received in my life! Ridiculously uneven, the left side of my head has hair over 2 inches longer than the right! Ridiculous. I have endured many shitty haircuts here and at other sportsclips but that's the last one. Don't want to rat out the hairstylist who did this but let's just say there was nothing ""Precious "" about this haircut.",1
"I was quite disappointed with this location because it did not have hamburgers on its menu. Kinda silly since they have chicken sandwich and hotdog, etc. I was also disappointed with my hotdog order. I ordered a foot long hot dog. The box it came in kinda made me giggle since it was so long.duh.foot long. But when we got home, it was actually just two hot dogs in the box. Ukh!",1
"This review is pretty much just for the frozen hot chocolate I tried and all the delicious looking food around me as I ate it. I had the peanut butter one and as a peanut butter fanatic it was soooo good! nI also tried their walk up ordering outside and I was less than impressed with everything there. If you go, go inside and order a frozen hot chocolate! It is a bit pricey though",2
"We went here with a group of friends.we had heard the food was good. The food was fantastic and they have the best chips and salsa ever! I would come back just for those. We ordered margaritas by the pitcher.two different kinds, both were fantastic! It was very casual and down home which is hard to find in Las Vegas.",2
ate here again! this time my parents were in town from Michigan . my mom is from Georgia and KNOWS soul food. they LOVED IT! Dad had chicken and waffles LOVED IT. Mom and I had the catfish and gritz with cheddar and jalapeno and BF had catfish on a sandwich. i think its called po boy catfish sandwich. SO YUMMY! We will be back again soon! again and again and again!,2
TOTAL SCAM! nWatch out. Tried to charge me ridiculously after my year contract was up. nI canceled and yet they continued to charge me. I had to cancel for a second time after giving them more money for their mistake. WATCH OUT! It was perfect while I was there and turned way down. I wish it was the gym I had originally joined. Now this is just another greedy gym with no ethics.,1
"For four more months now my local Walmart here has been well managed, so it's time to scoot them up to 4 Stars. I'm getting shopping carts that work properly, finding the things I need IN STOCK neatly placed, associates are reasonably easy to find with a question, responding satisfactorily, and checkout is ok. Yay! ",2
"It can be hard to get into, I think twice we tried to get their prime rib special and it was sold out by the time we sat down. But man, after walking around the capitol for a few hours in the freezing cold protesting governor dickless a lunch with a pint of Hopalicious and the best fried cheese curds I have ever eaten reminded me why I love Wisconsin.",2
"We have been VIP guest for 10 yrs. We are finished with this place. Our comps have dwindled down to nothing . We are big gamblers and didn't win a penny. We rented an umbrella space at the pool. What a waste of money, when the cabana girls leaves at 12pm everyone steals a place. When we left everyone was trying to take our spot. We will stay in colorado to gamble!",1
"The food is awesome! Particularly the hot wings and the traditional beef stew. Great place to hang out with friends. We were there for 5 hours. There was live music playing inside kinda loud doesn't allow for good conversations, so we sat outside as the weather was good that night. Had such a good time. Glad we found it. Will certainly go again.",2
"Went for the first time today. Kitchen was just wrapping up a re model, but they extended happy hour to accommodate and the food was pretty darn good. The happy hour specials were a great deal and the staff was really nice. Also love that the patio is in the shade all afternoon evening. Great summer spot.",2
"I have never had such a terrible experience at a dog park. There were 2 separate dogs who REPEATEDLY attacked my dog and several others, with no repercussion from their owner. On top of that, their owners seemed to be mad at me when I scolded their dog for biting mine. I will NEVER return to this park.",1
"Got a good meal for lunch, returned for dinner, but doesn't worth the 10 difference if the quality of the seafood not being improved for dinners. The flesh of the lobster pieces were ""black "" color! Crab legs were skinny and bland. I was very excited to try the dinner before going, but now I am afraid to go back or recommend it to anyone else.",1
"Pretty, modern, green.but corporate and architects run wild.in all this, they forgot the customer! Very inconvenient layout.plan on walking a mile to do anything! Difficult to navigate, spread out, and chicken t delivery. 2 drink coupons on arrival.good for the minimum well drink beer or wine. No free pours. The Washingtons are squeezed till they scream in this place. Stay Away!",1
Worst service of any restaurant I've ever been to in Las Vegas. I have walked in here twice and have never been greeted or spoken too. I have never actually eaten here since I never receive service. I don't understand if I'm doing something wrong but I've been twice with two different people and they said this is ridiculous and we should leave.,1
"This is about as good as it gets for fusion! An epicurean delight. I had to meet the owner chef Steve who created these unique dishes. I'm not even exaggerating when I say I was noisily eating, making close to obscene yummy sounds. I truly hope everyone gets to try this place gives Steve the credit he deserves. Nom nom nom!",2
"The food here tasted good, albeit rather pricey. We ordered sliders, salmon, and short rib and you'd expect small portions but we surprisingly left very full. My only complaint is that the restaurant seemed really dim the night I was there. Other than that, it's a really good place to go in Vegas if you're looking for a nice restaurant without the obscene cost found in a lot of the other places.",2
"I love Tropical Smoothie! My personal favs are promegrante plunge, acai berry boost, kiwi quencher. I also order king caesar wrap, salsa sunrise wrap and early bird junior. When I'm pressed for time I usually call to place my oder and it's wonderful to know that when I come to pick up that they know me by my name! Perfect place for healthy alternative!",2
"We ordered a cake from Marie's for a bachelorette party they were so excellent to work with and the cake turned out perfectly! It tasted delicious! Everyone in the group of twenty girls who we were with thought the cake flavor and icing were perfect. We weren't sure which bakery to go with since we are from out of town, I'm so glad we went with Marie's. Thanks!",2
Bouncers here are rude and disrespectful. Decided to check this place out last friday night. One of my friends who was not 21 paid the bouncers 40 bucks to get in. My other friend who is 21 was denied access because the bouncers said they don't allow Jordan sneakers. I went inside to check out the place and besides cheap drinks this place needs a lesson in customer service and federal laws.,1
No No No and Hell No! Do not give these people your business. I literally looked them up as I was talking to one of their representatives. Good thing because every single review I found was awful. Should have know because it sounded way to good to be true. Pay 40 ?! Tell them to save the drama for their mamma and HANG UP !,1
"The bagels are good but this morning the service was horrible. I walked in and to my surprise there was only one person ahead of me in line. So I thought to myself, ""great, this should be quick. "" Well, I was wrong. I sat there for over 20 minutes for two bagels?! The employees seemed to be taking their sweet time and messing up orders.",1
"The food was subpar and the service below that. We initially planned on a complete dining experience here, but after having the Seviche sampler, which only 1 of the 3 choices we selected was even above average we decided to take our taste buds elsewhere. The decor is very nice, but the food and service don't match that quality.",1
"Well, my wife had a hair in her shake sooo that is disgusting. Burgers were about a 3 5 and the fries were good and crisp. They gave us 3 bucks back for the shake and apologized. Overall it was too expensive, almost 30 and we could have went to Red Robin for that much. We were dissatisfied with our experience and won't be returning ",1
Good food nValet only nFar too loud inside. Had to yell and repeat myself constantly to a person just 3ft away. nAnd had to cup my ear to hear others. nOne of the bench tables has no back so you get to either bump into the people in back of you or lean far forward into your table. nBar is very small. nWon't be back. nToo bad. The food is pretty good.,1
"Dr Bachenheimer is awesome. She is compassionate and kind and on the cutting edge of medical knowledge. Unfortunately, I will never go back to her practice because of her front office person, Carrie. Carrie is rude, interrupts you when you speak is confrontational and completely difficult and infuriating to deal with. I have never been treated as badly as I have by Carrie.",1
"I had the Beach Burger today and my husband had the Parmaseanna Burger. Best burgers we've ever had for 7.00. They were seriously yummy! We also tried the french toast fries. more like a dessert than like fries. Still really interesting and tasty, but I'd only recommend them for someone who has a serious sweet tooth.",2
WORST place in Vegas to party. I have lived in this city for 18 years. All I can figure is that they have way too much business due to tourists and could care less about customer service. Cuz there's no way they would make it in the real world. Don't waste your time or money. There's a million other places in Vegas that deserve it.,1
"Overall this place is less than average. The service was pretty terrible and we had to wait about 20 minutes to get in, and when we finally walked in there were about 50 open tables in the place. The line was at least 15 parties deep at 9am, a pretty good time to have breakfast in Vegas on a Saturday. I'd pack it in and find someplace better next time.",1
"Pooja transforms! I tend to not take care of myself, putting everyone else first.She literally made me feel like I was on the red carpet.I looked like a celeb. She is passionate about what she does and puts her heart and soul into her work. I have recommended her over and over. Everyone walks away in complete awe. She is amazing!",2
"OK, so we had tickets to see ""Love, "" the Cirque de Soleil show at The Mirage doesn't every hotel have one? , and thought it would be easier to dine at the same hotel. Can somebody explain this type of ""Brazilian steakhouse "" to me? Yeah, it's ""all you can eat "" and that should have served as a warning to me, but . . . wasn't bad, but wasn't great . . . . Really 2.5 stars.",1
"I just had a spray tan yesterday and as usual I have great results! Jan makes you feel extremely comfortable and relaxed during the session! I love that after 3 hours you can shower, and your tan will continue to darken! However, as far as service goes, it is very poor. Jan is unprofessional with her many phone calls during sessions, as well as comes off ""scatter brained "".",1
"The food and wine was amazing but there is one reason we will not return. Midway through my meal I was really ready for another glass of the yummy cab I was drinking from Napa but the line to get another glass was so long and my food would have gotten cold if I would have waited. If this restaurant was sit down with wait staff I would be there all the time. Amazing food, great wine, poor concept.",1
This is my favorite pizza place in Vegas. I've probably ate here about 10 15 times in the last 7 years. I just love how cheesy it is and hot crispy the crust is. If you are around Circus Circus you have to try the pizza. Price is good and size is good. They fill it up with toppings. Service is good also.,2
I love this place! The service is quick and friendly and the food is great! There are more than enough vegetarian options and too much good salsa to try! My favorite was the cilantro and the pecan dressing. They are so fresh and the food didn't take long to come at all. I will definitely visit agaiext time I'm in Phoenix,2
This place is soo cool. A group of us were waiting for a shuttle to the strip butit never came so we partied all night at GeeBees. We bought so many drinks and food and the bill only came out to 60. I would go to vegas just to go back there again. We had such a good time there. And the guys played shuffleboard so the girls could have a good time. 10 off if you have a timeshare at worldmark.,2
"I absolutely love the staff and they level of service they provide here. Everyone is so warm, courteous, and accommodating. They have free hotel shuttle service to and from the airport, Epic and within a 3 mile radius of the place. nKnock off one star for the facilities. The place is older and could definitely use some updating. All four times that I stayed, my room was pretty clean.",2
"Menu was incorrect, they didn't have some of the items advertised on there in store menu anymore. Food was definitely sub par. My tortilla soup was edible but it didn't taste like tortilla soup. The chicken meat in my taco had no flavor. My husband said his Baka taco was good. And my sister in laws quesadilla tasted like a quesadilla. On an up note, the salsa bar salsas were pretty good.",1
"Awesome festival. Crazy costumes, fun performances, lots of souvenirs, bonsai trees, crazy anime kids, and lots of food. The boy and I went Sunday and it was outrageously busy. We walked around for a while, picked up some steam buns and kaluei ? ice, and did some people watching. It was a good time.",2
"Mediocre Thai food. Not sure where the 4 stars came from. We ordered their signature dishes, Crispy Basil chicken just ok , Pad Thai I've had better, shrimps were salty! , Calamari Salad we barely ate it , Fried Tofu nothing special and Duck Curry the worst duck curry we've ever had . It's safe to say we won't be back.",1
"This was my first visit to Southwest Dental in Chandler but it was definitely one of by best dental experiences yet. I had no wait do to the number of dentist on staff and everyone one there was very professional, polite an talkative. The only negative I could say is the admin staff did lose my insurance info but now that I'm in their system it shouldn't be an issue again.",2
Jarlings serving sizes suck. I bought a 4.63 MED cold fudge sundae and it was 3 4 inch below the rim of the cup including the fudge. When I mentioned it I might as well have been speaking gibberish because it didn't even register with the employee who was training a new person . I wouldn't recommend them for their poor service and poor portions. Thanks for listening.,1
I love Panda and this is one of my most favorite fast food restaurants in Phoenix. I love the way they cook their orange chicken. It tastes so good. Even I am not hungry I can buy a bowl and finish it off. I think their orange chicken is the best and after that honey walnut shrimp. The store is clean and I have never had any problem with them.,2
Currently in line. It's 10 32pm. Got here at 10pm. Slowest service on earth. Ordered a milkshake and a sprite zero. I'm pretty sure they are milking the cow to use to make the ice cream for my shake. Avoid at all costs. I'm actually upset I have to give 1 star. There needs to be an option to give negative stars. It is now 10 40pm. I'm leaving. F this.,1
"If you are looking for an amazing cup of coffee this is the place! My wife and I never agree on coffee, yet we both love a plain cup of Joe at the Bold Roost. Some other reviews are misleading, this is a coffee place with breakfast sandwiches, not a breakfast menu. Nothing for the kids to eat so we enjoyed the coffee and headed out.",2
"Horrible company! Did not complete installation, installer did not even use plastic, and a 2 4 day job is now going over a week! They also delete bad reviews of themselves from Facebook! Dan owner is a liar himself in that he promised to call us back and satisfy his customers. He is a dishonest man and runs a dishonest company! NEVER use this company!",1
Way too many steps now in the parking process at east economy. Drive in park.walk to shuttle stop area.wait.catch open air shuttle to train.train ride . cool .home.down to baggage.back up to train.train to open air shuttle.somewhere near car.more expensive than off airport parking.all that for one billion dollars.,1
"Downtown Vegas just gets better with age! The Freemont Street Experience is a lot of fun! The street is blocked off to traffic which is great and the atmosphere is party, party, party! There are lots of fun little casino's, shopping, drinking and awesome shrimp cocktail at The Golden Gate.YUM! There was great live music and a heart stopping motorcycle act! We had a fabulous time. go downtown!",2
"Cuisine tr u00e8s fine, les portions n'en sont pas moins g u00e9n u00e9reuses. Le plateau d u00e9couverte est un r u00e9gal pour les papilles. Seul hic, le prix, qui rend ce restaurant beaucoup moins accessible. Le service est irr u00e9prochable, de plus les plats ne mettent pas beaucoup de temps u00e0 arriver. Bref, u00e0 recommander pour les amateurs de poisson cru et m u00eame de grillades.",2
their subs are just ok. i feel like I have to add to many things in order to have some flavor. I went to this particular location and it was kind of dirty. the only good thing is that they always send coupons on the mail for free subs. but even then I would recommend for you to go to one of their competitor.,1
"Dillons is a great addition to the North Cenpho Hood. BBQ Sports Bar, Friendly service, lots of Tv's and 1 Dollar order of onion rings in the bar. The Brisket and Mild sauce is real good, The sides are a bit hit and miss, but the fries and the mac and cheese are very good. All in all, a great place for a cheap lunch, or to hang out to watch a game. This place is gonna stick for sure.",2
"It's always a good feeling leaving your hair stylist knowing you look good. I have been going here for a few years and I have never been disappointed. You do not need to worry about getting a cut that doesn't work for your face or your style. Only draw back is the parking, make sure you have quarters if you end up at a meter.",2
"Great service and prices and wonderful atmosphere. During lunch my friend and I were one of the only seven people there, so it wasn't too busy. It took way too long for one pizza, and when it got over it was lukewarm and the bottom completely black. I couldn't even taste my toppings. Its an hour later and I still have the charcoal taste in my mouth. Wish I had a better experience!",1
"worst ever! the lady messed up my order and when i came to her for refund because i coldnt wait anymore she started shaking and barely gave me my back and accused me of eating it, as she gave me back she said you are not welcome here anymore' i was speechless so unprofessional! do not go here , even when they dont receive good tip they dont even thank you , money hugry! god forgive them!",1
"Us Bank is awesome! I used to use Wells Fargo and was unhappy with all their stupid fees and with how they used to hold back the availability of funds. Since I've made the switch to US Bank I've been much happier. No B.S. fees and the tellers are way friendlier and way more helpful. I highly recommend US Bank, especially the one on E Sunset Rd or the one by Windmill Eastern.",2
"By now we've visited Freddys at least a dozen times or more. The staff is always friendly, the environment is always clean and upbeat, and the food is always consistently good. Fyi, we're pretty addicted to their fries, not sure why but they're so damn good. Maybe the seasoning is laced with crack, I don't know but they're awesome!",2
"Yes, I'm a sucker for things that are cute and that is the reason why I'm a fan of the Wicked Spoon Buffet. The presentation of the food definitely appeals to me, everything is portioned off in its cute serving plates which makes picking your buffet items much more fun. The Hotel Casino itself is very hip and trendy and I would love to come here again if and when I do buffet in Vegas.",2
Not impressed at all. I had to keep my car another week because my father passed away. I called to extend and told them why I had to extend. No note was made and I paid over 500 for 12 days. Should have been 400. nYou will take TWO busses from the Vegas airport to get the car.not worth it . nDriver from fox was very slow. Too frekin slow.,1
"3 people I know, including myself, have had food poisoning from this establishment. Figure this shit out BK. It could be from that so called ""cow "" meat that you use, poor work ethic carelessness from the employees, or as a fast food conglomerate, health of the consumers is last on the priority list. People, do not eat this trash, it is disgusting and is a slow killer.",1
"Pros good food, kind and caring staff, all vegan. Did I mention all vegan?! Good prices for the food. They recycle and compost, which is cool. nCons all disposable plates, a feeling as if the space isn't quite finished. I guess I just wanted or expected real plates, silverware, and glasses. nIn the future, I would purchase the oatmeal mixes but would probably not dine in.",2
"Two words Pollo Fundido. Wear your fat jeans or sweats and go eat one. Then go home and take a shower, unless you like to smell of grease. Love this place. Never disappoints. . If the line is long, call the take out line and order while you wait. Your food will probably be ready by the time you get to the counter.",2
"I hate this place. It's just completely crappy Mexican food and everything I despise about the preponderance of people who honestly think they know how to run a restaurant and make authentic cuisine. It's uninspired, bland, and perfect for anyone from out of town who thinks Taco Bell is indigenous. Please. Go elsewhere. It's also dingy, the waitstaff is bored, and the margaritas are weak.",1
A very very good BBQ place I ordered the brisket which was completely on point ! Tender fresh and full of authentic BBQ flavor! Also had the Mac and cheese which was very good as well! I loved nThe set up its simple and to the point and gives u a BBQ feel! Staff if very nice nAnd for 10 u get a full meal incl a drink,2
"Second best pizza place in town. Its the only place that serves slices that's worth going to. Because its cheap and tasty, when we're stuck on campus, thats usually where we end up. I recommend the spotted goat pizza. We also get empanadas but those can get pricey if you order a lot. I was a little unimpressed with the dessert empanadas but the other flavors are good too!",2
"Disappointed. I usually go to Archie's or Pin Kaow for Thai food but since this place is closer to my house, I wanted to give it a try. The prices are a little higher than other places and that's ok with me IF the food is great. But the food was not great, not even good. It was OK. And it seemed the portions were smaller than other places as well. I won't be going here again.",1
"They must do something about the line situation. Always long and it takes forever. And today they added 3 to my salad because it had the chicken walnut salad on top instead of just plain chicken. I've been ordering this salad regulary for over a year and no one has ever charged me extra. Oh, and the paper to go boxes are so annoying. Probably the last time I go here.",1
"I use this bridge when on a rtl bus going to the gf's place. During rush hours one lane in the opposite direction is closed off to allow buses to bypass the congestion. However this bridge is in terrible shape, bumps and pot holes everywhere. Also I would do the sign of the cross when using this bridge. Praying that it won't collapse!",1
"this place sucked! dont eat here. although ill say the name ""more buffet "" is appropriate as when u go to thier breakfast brunch buffet.u want that exactly more. more food, more variety, more warmer foods. what a waste of 20 bucks. if u enjoy eating cat food and dog food, hell even lama food this is the place to be.not to mention if ur in the market for a lady er.65 .this is the hot spot.",1
"I really wanted to like this place more. The ambiance and everything is so romantic and cozy but that can't save the review. I ordered La Bastille spinach, mushroom and bechamel with dill creme fraiche and was not at all impressed or satisfied with my lunch. The crepe itself was extremely thick, chewy and somehow dry. The filling was bland and I basically ate it because it was 13.",1
"Woah! SLOW SERVICE! It wasn't busy at all. and an oil change ended up taking 2 hours! A bit frustrating. They also try to persuade you into getting all these things that you ""supposedly "" need. I know that's how you tack on a sale, but just let me go already! Especially after spending 2 hours in your establishment. That's all I have to say.",1
"i really don't know what these other reviewers are talking about, the pizza is ok but nothing to write hme about. as good or bad as any normal pizza place in town. BUT at 20 for a personal pizza it ""s a rip off. The staff however are very nice and the service is good but agaiot worth the price at all. Also the decor is borderline ghetto Oh yeah and no credit cards. So bring cash for this pit.",1
A close second on my list of favorite Mexican food restaurants of all time. I had the green chili or was it the red? and it was spicy and filling. My margarita was huge and no skimping on tequila occurred. r n r nAll that food for a low price it's no wonder this place is consistently voted one of the best in the Phoenix metro area.,2
Called and ordered a large thin crust for delivery. Was told 35 to 45 min. That was ok. After an hour I called back and was told that was for pick up. No. In our 20 years of doing business with this Dominos we have always had delivery. Finally the pizza arrived. COLD. Guess I will have to find a different delivery shop.,1
"Beers, beers, and more beers! An amazing selection of beers. Prices varies depeding on which beer you get. There's this specific beer that I get, that tastes like chocolate. I know it's not Guiness. Do come here during the week or early at nights cause it does get packed with a line! Great for groups, and they have nice bathrooms.",2
"Its decent enough but not amazing, its a fast food burger but better then most.cajun fries are a bonus, the workers love to shout, which I think is weird, but oh well. Its a simple menu, with a little more to it then in out, but its solid.worth a shot, but the regular burger is a double and you feel like you may give birth to a food baby after you eat here.that is all",2
"A nice central McDonald's with ample fountain drink dispensers for the visitors. Be aware of your surroundings here, it attracts a few transient people. The WiFi provided by AT T sometimes works, just like their cellular reception, so no surprise there. I'm a frequent visitor here to grab drinks work before visiting hotels. There are quite a few power plugs for laptops inside of the building.",2
"I absolutely love this place. The staff is friendly and the food is DELICIOUS! The buffets are great and so is any food you order off the menu. I have never had a bad meal here before. Every time we are in Madison, we stop by and have lunch or dinner or take an order out. We are seriously going to miss Maharaja's now that we've moved to South Florida. No Indian food lives up to this place.",2
"Do not go here. Just dont. They try to rip you off any way that they can. Overpriced. Talk to you like you're an absolute idiot, argued with two different people from there. Zero knowledge on how to treat customers. I cannot believe I wasted my money here. I want the 10 minutes of my life that I spent in this dump back.",1
"I work nearby and LOVE this place! Service is quick and friendly and the food is always delicious. The unholy guacamole and queso is a must they make the guac right in front of you exactly the way you like it! Single taco salad is a great deal for those that can't help but gorge themselves on the salsa and bottomless chips beforehand. This place rocks, I've never been disappointed!",2
"This place rocks! Located right on the capitol square, the Old Fashioned is all about Wisconsin. They have 30 beers to choose from here. Every beer I tried was great. My favorite was the Spotted Cow. I've never had cheese curds before I tried them here. The fried cheese curds and the dipping sauces were over the top. Why are you still reading? Get over there now!",2
Cozy little coffee house. They have a wonderful Sunday brunch also. Great meeting place with friends and family. Beats Starbucks any day! Best Iced Tea hands down.anywhere! The green tea is the same you get at the Camelback Inn Spa! Ask for the frequent drink card! Drive thru gets a little busy in the morning but worth the wait. Their drive thru is open 24 7 ! Love this in our neighborhood.,2
"I really enjoyed this place! The low star rating almost deterred my friend and I from trying this place, but it was too close to home not to and we are so glad we did! The rolls are fresh, tasty, and very quickly prepared which is always nice when you're getting the AYCE which has a time limit. The service was fantastic. Both our servers were attentive and friendly as well!",2
Went to Sonoran Beauty for a last minute highlight and style when my hairstylist canceled at the last minute. I went to Caley and she was awesome. Everyone at the salon was super sweet. My mom and baby were also there waiting for me and they were very accomodating to the 3 of us. Would definitely recommend!,2
"This is the best Thai restaurant I've been to in AZ so far. None of the dishes I've ordered has ever disappointed me or the people I'm with. nTheir curries are yummy, and the spicy eggplant is so good that I get it every time, though a lot of other dishes here rock as well. Very friendly staff. Lunch is SUPER busy here, so if you're in a hurry, I'd skip lunch here and come for dinner.",2
"Don't do it. They will look for every way to add extra charges once you sign an agreement with them. After being fed up and trying to cancel, their settlement to get out is to pay out 75 of the entire contract.which means they have to bully people into staying with them.nice. And all this info will be given to you over the phone with a ghetto like attitude for customer service.",1
"I. AM. OBSESSED. nI love everything about this place! D u00e9cor, vibe and of course, food are AWESOME. I've gotten stuck on the quinoa salad and have been craving it daily. HUGE BONUS is the kids menu. I took my munchkin with me and he could get fresh, un fried food too! Mac cheese, smashed potatoes, broc roasted vegetables are some of his new favorites. Love it! Uhhh.can I get a punch card? ",2
"I'd say Bad Daddy's has some of the most interesting sounding burger combinations ive seen in town. They are big and tasty and come with tots instead of fries if you want, which I recommend. Can get pretty busy so getting on the list with the NoWait app is recommended. Seemed to be a kid friendly place as many families were there. Look forward to trying another burger soon.",2
"Went to the Ranch for the first time and it was'nt baseball lol, I attended the ""Rumble at the Ranch "" MMA fights that Trilogy MMA had out there on the 23rd. The park is awesome great venue food was good seating was great, and the field looks immaculate now that I know where this place is I'll definately go back and catch a game or two.",2
Great atmosphere loved being able to have a beer and watch the panthers. The fried chicken is really worth coming here. I will come when I have a hankering for fried chicken again. I was disappointed in the cheesy grits very bland. I had to ad extra extra salt and pepper to add flavor. The bar selection was ok. I'm on the lookout for locals and had a couple nice ones. Server was friendly and ok.,2
I hate doctors and avoid them like the plague. But sometimes you just have go to . like when you have a bad cut on your thumb and eventually need 7 stitches. Was I just lucky? I was able to see someone in 15 minutes and they were caring and attentive. They give health professionals a good name. They also have some generous hours. A lot of urgent cares seemed to close at 8 pm.,2
"Had the Arizona burger with grilled chicken. Definitely worth the 10 with the Cajun fries. My wife has a salad that seemed a bit ""lacking "", but the rest of the party had burgers and they were solid. Beer selection was really good and they had plenty of TVs for college football. Definitely an upgrade over the previous proprietor. Oh, fried pickles were really good as well.",2
"I love the concept. Healthy food with a trendy flare. A cool, hip staff and an incredible buildout make this place a pleasure to eat at. I've never had a bad experience with the staff. The food is good, the soup is amazing. My only quibble How can you market yourself as a place that makes ""true food "" and sell farmed salmon?",2
"The ginger dressing salad was the best thing there. All the other stuff is just ok and seemed kinda cheap. After trying the appetizers, I chose to skip the sushi. The staff really tries but I think that there is not much to get excited about at this place. It's dark in there and probably brings them down. Not going back. Much better places in vegas.",1
"Meh. I don't think this place is all that great but I only went one time and perhaps I just hit it at the wrong time. I ordered a hamburger cooked to medium to go and it was well done very well done. The fries were just ok which was unfortunate. It was an ""OK "" meal but not great. I'd only go back because there aren't a lot of options at this location but I wouldn't go back if I had more options.",1
"What a great place to hang out when US Airways hangs you out to dry for a few extra hours. We had the Mediterranean MIsto Salad and a Scottish Smoked Salmon and both were delicious. But more importantly, the wine selection here is fabulous, including such rock star names as Grgich and Stag's Leap. Lovely. Location 5 STARS nAmbiance 4 1 2 STARS nFood Wine 5 STARS nService 5 STARS nNoise Level high",2
Doesn't matter if you just went to the buffet or your gambling if you have a sweet tooth this is the place to stop They have some of the best desert items I have ever had! Everything from melt in your mouth chocolate too creamy goodness I tried a few flavors and got a scoop of peanut butter gelato and a scoop of caramel gelato,2
"This place looks like a regular army surplus from the outside when you get inside its high end and high class and hi tech ammo, goods, food, and clothing and zombie supplies of course Walking Dead fans, this is a must Stop by location! nthey also have actual zombie hunts! with paint ball guns sweet Friday night times!",2
"Unfortunately, they're CLOSED. I shopped there as a Davidson student in the 1970's. I bought tons of AV gear there cameras, dissolve units, slide projectors, lenses, cases, etc. when I was a producer of multi image in the 1980s. I miss those folks. They were professionals and specialists in every sense of the words.",2
"OK, update time. Sushi we split was good. Miso soup had an odd taste this visit. nMy main course Butaniku was unforgettable, a real meh! Not sure what happened this night. Our waitress was MIA most of the night. Could not even find her to try to get refills, desert or our check. Must have been an off night for everyone.",1
"Took some guests in from out of town and it was so LOUD that we got up from our table and went to Bar North to dine outside.same menu, but not quite what we had hoped to experience. Tiny round tables to dine.just because the employees may like loud music, let's not forget who pays the bill! I ordered brussels sprouts and they arrived and they weren't even trimmed up.an oversight I hope.",1
"Loved this place. Went there for lunch. Had the Crepe with local mushrooms, holly grove chevre, truffle honey and balsamic dressing. It was amazing. Also had a great drink in the one of the chilled libations the Pumpkin Potcheen North Carolina moonshine local pumpkin mulling spices topped with Blenheim's Ginger Ale . Also had great bread served with blueberry butter. Very friendly service as well.",2
"Hot shaving cream to clean up the edges on a haircut? A hot towel and massage to wind down? This place is fantastic. Rushel is everything I want to see in a barber, and one of the best parts of prepping for my recent wedding was going to him for a hot shave and tune up. Gold Scissors is clean, well equipped, and everything about it shows the pride and care that they have for their business.",2
"OMG! Went tonight and the baby back ribs were not on the menu! They still made them for us but said they will be ""phasing them out "". Please mister manager or corporate person re think this. If you take the ribs off the menu my wife won't want to go as often! You are gonna lose customers! nSave the Baby Backs!",2
As much as I love this place and the way elan does my nails she has a serious problem with being on time. EVERYTIME I make an appt she is late for it. Last time she was a half hour late and when she came in she brought coffee. She's now 10 minutes late for my appt and I'm sure she'll show up in about 20.,1
I was recently introduced to Z Pizza and now I can't get enough. I really enjoy the variety they offer but my favorite thing is the pesto sauce! They rotate through different pizzas that you can get by the slice each day or you can order your favorite full size pizza. My Kids live this pizza. My picky eater says it is the best pizza she has ever had.,2
"This is a fairly small store, though I did like a few things I saw there. I did not stay to try them on because I was very uncomfortable around the male shopkeeper. I might have put aside my discomfort and tried something on had it not been for a shouting match he got involved in immediately outside the front of the store. That display of temper made me so uncomfortable, I left.",1
"One of the better burgers I've had in a while. Ordered the Farm Burger just to try the duck bacon, and that along with the egg was amazing. Nothing like a juicy burger with bacon and a runny egg yolk! The truffle fries were great as well. Only gripe was after being seated the server took forever to come back, but I will definitely come back here my next time in Vegas.",2
By far the noisiest rv park ever. The construction going on behind us starts before sunrise every morning. We don't sleep in late but a little quiet before 8 00 is not a lot to ask for. Bathrooms are very small especially for this size park. You are paying for the location here and that is ALL. The staff however was friendly to us when we checked in.,1
Absolutely perfect. Nothing beats a bowl of spicy well made broth with freshly made noodles and tender beef. The Szechwan beef bowl was exactly what I was looking for as a late night meal. nMy wife had the miso soup which was also above expectations but I don't think I'll ever be able to resist the Szechwan beef.,2
"While waiting for my car wash, I ordered the crispy pulled pork over creamy grits with jalape u00f1o bacon think it was called Pig Grits for a late breakfast. At any rate, the inventor of this concoction is an evil genius it was awesome and I highly recommend. My son ordered the Mac and Cheese and he loved it too. We love this place! Oh yeah, they do a really good job washing your car as well. ",2
"My husband and I were interested in taking the Mob Tour 75 ea , followed by the Haunted Las Vegas Tour 60 ea . We asked our concierge to get the tickets for us and the woman on the phone was so rude and disorganized that we decided to pass. So, Mob Tours, you lost 270 today because your receptionist was incompetent. Way to go.",1
"It was a great place to get protein UNTIL they dropped their website. It has ""been under construction "" for months and months. My question is why would a business like this NOT have a website? It says to call in to order, how can a customer call in an order when they don't see what you have for sale, just guess? Bad business move.",1
Beware! If you are flying on a Sunday make sure to get to this airport two hours early. I made the mistake of showing up an hour before my flight and I missed my flight back to Sacramento due to the long lines and the amount of people in the airport. It was a nightmare and I had to spend all day in airports due to this. Be prepared for a long wait!,1
"I really enjoyed a nice dinner for 3 at this restaurant. We ate for under 75 for 3 people and we're satisfied. The food is good and presented well. Some items may need a touch more salt, but the overall experience will have me coming back again. I especially am hapoy that foie gras is available down the street from home when I'm craving it",2
I've been going to Dr. Justin for several years now and I have always received good care and good value. I've bought glasses and contacts through the office and I have always had an offer of a coupon or rebate. And they are so organized and efficient that I always leave with the right paperwork for file for the rebates.,2
"For a few bucks more, run to the Rio Carnival buffet! We wanted to try something new and came here and was letdown. The only thing I liked was the clams cooked in butter. Everything else was mediocre. The servers were not professional and were too caught up in their conversations with each other than serving. The food was either cold, bland, tough, or just ugh.",1
"I've heard a lot about this place and maybe my expectations were high but I wasn't impressed. THe breakfast potatoes were bland, the eggs were extremely oily, the pancakes were too doughy. not my favorite place at all but I liked the old diner look and feel to it. I would go back just for the ambiance. The service was great . the waitress was on top of her game, super sweet.",1
"Although I regularly miss Dog Eat Dog around noon every week day, I'm pleased that Muramoto replaced it and gave us a place to blow our cash on Sunday nights. The chef's tasting is key. And use the bathroom with the sink that makes you want to get out your GI Joes and Barbies and play in the bubbles all night.",2
"Tried this place for the first time and got the mini Maui chicken for lunch. Teriyaki is mediocre at best, chicken is not freshly prepared as if they took it out of the fridge and stuck it in the microwave for a few seconds. Salad is just a cheap head of iceberg lettuce chopped up. I should've headed down the street to Leo's Hawaiian and stuck to my usual.",1
"This facility to appears to be underfunded and the issue presents itself in several ways. In my experience, this seems to be a characteristic of the quality of services received. The health providers lack knowledge and experience that you would not typically see in better facilities. If you have other options available to you I would explore them first.",1
"Thomas Keller can make me breakfast anytime.well his peeps anyway. The food is reasonably priced compared to the rest of Vegas, and it's definitely really good. Brunch was filling and tasty, and I really liked the wine list.who wouldn't! Oh yeah there was a wait.like 2 minutes with free Bouchon pastries.I'll wait two minutes for those anyday!",2
Can't beat the price for an afternoon or morning of play for the kids! The new snack bar is great and I like that there are rooms for the smaller kids to play away from the more rambunctious older kids. I wish it was closer but we'll worth the drive to let my girl run and play till she nearly falls asleep on her feet!,2
"Ate here with a group of omnis, and everybody loved the food. The crispy chicken sandwiches were tasty but very small. I had the lemongrass beef with cold noodles flavorful and not too heavy. I'll be back to try other items when I'm back in Vegas. Service was a bit on the slow side hence the 4 instead of 5 stars.",2
Saw this place in KAET Channel 8 Check Please show. Wow. Best Mediterranean food I have enjoyed. We had the Adam and Eve chicken and beef kabobs with Saffron rice. Kabobs outstanding and the saffron rice is a must. Also had the Mediterranean catfish. I can't say enough about the catfish. This is a small hidden jewell. We are now regulars here. Another table had lamb shank that looked awesome.,2
"I was very pleased with my meal at DJ's. The 15 for 10 was totally worth it, I got a bowl and an order of chips. It was really good, much better than most of the surrounding places to eat. I will totally stop there again. I recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable bite to eat that is actually decent food.",2
"Not a fan of this place. Drinks are over priced, crappy music, and slow bartenders make it nearly unbearable. However, the 2 happy hours they pass out like candy make it a good pregame spot. Since it's one of the few dance places it attracts all the scantily clad clubrats. A lot of my friends like it but it's not my thing. It gives pub a bad name.",1
"Hmmm. I'm not feeling the love for this place. The only way I can describe the ambience is.weird. Not a fan of the color scheme or the lighting it just doesn't give me that warm, fuzzy feeling I like in a neighborhood joint. And the beer don't get me wrong they have a good selection.but it's pricey. I probably won't be busting down any doors to come back.",1
"Taramusalata, calamari, cheeses galore! Delicious appetizers and super satisfying pork souvlaki dinner. I couldn't eat another bite and everything was finely seasoned without being salty. They have a number of repeat patrons from the way they chatted to the customers as if they saw them all the time.",2
"This place is not good. They don't execute the basic fundamentals of cooking well. Put this restaurant in NYC and it wouldn't last a month but here it has almost five stars mind boggling. If you like an overcooked pork shop and a management team that likes to talk about bs rather than make sure you have good service or good food , go here for sure.",1
"When traveling on business I search for restaurants with a bar and superb food. L'express filled that need. Yes, it is a certain business tourist destination, but what I really liked is being treated like a queen, served with perfect wine pairings and the bartenders wonderfully delicious french accents. The fish soup was delightful and the company was even better.",2
"Might be my new favorite place to hang out on Central, be a part of the ""scene "" and eat some really great food. The staff was friendly and helpful. My Hawaiian Margarita was awesome. Too bad I was the DD.one was not enough. Everyone at the table had something unique and different and we all loved it. Can't wait to go back and try something else. It was scrumptious!",2
"My husband and I came to Rio Rico for the first time last week. We were even lucky enough to make it in time for happy hour. The house margaritas were delicious! We had the carnitas as well as the chile relleno with beef flauta and every single bite was great. To top it off, we received awesome service by our waiter, Mario. When we return we will definitely ask for him!",2
I had the same experience as Anabel A.in the previous review. The man used his nails to push my cuticles. He has a dirty towel under my hand with nail scraps on it from people before. he used dirty tools. he coughed in my face. it was gross. i should have known better. nnever go here! i certainly wont.,1
"Went there for breakfast with family. Very similar to Wicked Spoon buffet at Cosmo. Great selection of food.specially like the back section with the Asian food. You can order your owoodles, they have dim sum, miso and congee. Better to get discount somehow using rewards card or something.otherwise get ready to pay about 80 for a family of four for breakfast during the mid week.",2
"Ordered the chicken panini from the take out side of the restaurant. ""No avocado mayonnaise please. "" It was handed to me 15 minutes later full of the unwanted green goo. ""Try again please. "" 10 minutes later I get one back, but it was petrified. It was like a big brown rock. I used it as a card protector at the poker table. You get a big fat F, Skybox.",1
"I agree with Insider Pages, the staff is super rude for either dine in or to go, I guess I am not pretty enough or the right color. Beware of cashier 19. nThe manager is controlled by the staff. In this economy with those prices and that attitude NO THANK YOU! Never again. nTry DaVinci Pizza down the road, the owner takes pride in his pizza and the taste is almost as good for half the price.",1
"Great live music and atmosphere near the bar. The menu is almost exactly like City Hall and the service is just as spectacular. The food is pricey, but completely worth it. The one thing Ocean Club has over City Hall is the band. They sound WONDERFUL and the atmosphere is hopping. If you want a fabulous meal and great entertainment, this is the spot for you.",2
"Buffets have come along way since I moved out of Las Vegas and yet I hold onto my love for the Garden Court. Part nostalgia, part longing for the world of buffets before 25 price tags and sushi stations and chocolate dipped strawberries. I live in San Francisco now, so I don't come to Las Vegas for good food, obviously. But whenever I return, I can't resist the lunch buffet here.",2
"Worst customer service ever. Every time I go to this salon there is a LONG WAIT. I'm talking like hours. It's not because their service is good, it's because they have 2 people working all the time and they always tell you it will be 15 minutes and you end up waiting an hour and a half. I just left for the last time I will never go back to NV nails.",1
"If you are a snail or a sloth THIS is the place for you because everything is SLOOOOOW! We had to search for a hostess, never found her, not quite sure if they even have one. Drinks took forever, food took forever, service took FOREVERRRR n insert Squints from the movie Sandlot saying this . We were actually laughing at how long drinks took for nearby tables as well.",1
This show is as good as it gets! This is an example of what LOVE can do! MJOne is simply brilliant. The perfect combination of two geniuses .Michael Jackson and Cirque Du Soleil. Michael's mastery is evident .and NO ONE can take that away from him. I am so excited to see the show again.and will head back to Vegas in July !,2
I love the Mongolian beef with noodles have getting here for years. I was glad to see no Arpaio in sight the doors back open. My wife loves the Dan Daoodles the kids get honey seared chicken. I stop in this crazy busy location only when I'm in the area because the parking lot is insane. I think the concept is great the service is always quick. Consistency is the key to this place.,2
"After realizing that Tin Tin is a steep 23 person for dinner on a weeknight, China Buffet was our next choice for a friend's birthday dinner. For 12 person, you can't beat this place! Pretty standard Chinese buffet food, but it was tasty! I especially liked the lo mein and teriyaki chicken. I will be back, especially for the to go option 4.99 lb for lunch, 5.99 lb for dinner !",2
"We love Chicago style pizza. This place is practically across the street from our house. This should be a match made in heaven. Sadly, no. The cost is way more than it should be. The staff are not happy. The order will be wrong more often than right. And to top it off, the taste isn't that great. I can't recommend it.",1
"I think the quality of the food has taken a dive here in the past year. The salads come out looking sort of sad, with bruised avocados the pasta seems like a sea of noodles with very few goodies mixed in. It's too bad. Used to be one of my favorite places for brunch or dinner. I used to really like this place, but now avoid it.",1
"Not only is it one of the most badass museums you'll see in your life, it also offers the most outstanding experience you can think of. Yes, you get a nicely laid out history and great exhibition, but you also get to drive a real life simulation with training and explanations. Also, the souvenir shop rocks! Basically, this museum is awesome.",2
Wtf. Only giving a 1 star rating because they changed the chicken enchilada soup. Who's the jackass who decided to change the soup. Steward fire him or her please. This bar was sooooo busy u had to fight to get to the bar what happened? How much money ru you losing now? It's scary to think about it? Maybe It's about time to make a change. As business owner what the fuck are you thinking?,1
"Pros Small airport that is easy to get to Cons I had to wait in the security line for over half an hour because they had only ONE SECURITY gate open. ONE. Good thing I got the later flight. Decent selection of eateries once past security Wendy's, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf . Good selection of airlines Southwest has a flight from LV to Burbank, CA.",2
Ok. Went there last night. We don't have a lot of choices way out here in the West Valley. The service and food were great. Tables were clean. Curry chicken and shrimp fried rice were both excellent. I'll be coming back again. If you want to try some good Chinese food this is the place. Take out also.,2
"Good pizza, not the best that I've eaten. Personally I love a good pizza, Woodland definitely satisfies that craving. Although I would not put it up there with the best pizza that I have eaten, it's probably in my top 5. In you live in the Verdun Ile des Soeurs area you have to make this your go to pizza place because there is none better.",2
"We went here with a party of 10 on a Wednesday night. We ordered 3 sampler platters, since nobody could decide what they wanted. The wings were good, but the food that should have been warm was cold. Or warm on the outside and cold on the inside. For what you are paying, it isn't worth it for cold or lukewarm food.",1
"Where a kid can be a kid.and adults too. 5 for a 30 minute session is more than enough for first timers. It takes a lot of energy effort to really take advantage of this place so make sure you warm up stretch too. Once you build your skill and stamina, then you can go for longer sessions. They even have a 3 D dodgeball section. Enjoy!",2
"We were on our way to Las Vegas and read about the The Vulture Mine in Wickenburg, AZ. We decided to stop by and take a tour of the town. You better have your batteries charged and enough memory on your camera. I literally took over 300 pictures here! Definately a ghost town with awesome photo ops buildings, old cars, vintage furniture, etc. The pricing is very cheap and well worth the visit!",2
"Wow booked this through hotel tonight. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable, and spacious. The pool is huge, with a water slide to keep your kids happy. Waterfalls all around the pool. The buffet breakfast with omelet station was enough to fill up my 2 teens. And the spa has wicked deals on massages mom Thursday.",2
Awesome awesome awesome. This is the place to get adventurous with the dining. Go for the sweetbreads. Do the oxtail and the lamb's tongue. If you can't stomach it. the calamari app with capers is YUM and the mint love letters Primi is to die for. The duck entree. can't be beat and the rabbit makes me want to hop around and do a little dance. I love this place. Eat Here.,2
"Love the popcorn flavoring, the rocking seats and stadium seating! I choose to go to this thearter more often then the one across the street, which is also an Arrowhead thearter but is an AMC. Here they have the flavor topings for the popcorn and the seating just seems to be more comfortable. Come to think of it I cannot recall the last time I went to the thearter across the street.",2
This is not the place to come to if you are craving authentic Italian fare. Linguini Portofino was bland and tasteless nSpaghetti Carbonara looked disgusting after it cooled down a little due to the hardening of the bacon fat nCalamari appetizer had more green beans than calamari and what was in it of the calamari was undercooked and mushy Not sure how this place stays in business,1
"Party of 6 with reservations seated immediately. Service was friendly as mentioned in the other reviews, waters were always topped off. The bread and ""green "" herb butter to start was great and everyone enjoyed their meals. I went with the veal parmesan special and was very pleased with my selection. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for fine Italian dining. Cheers!",2
"I had lunch and dinner here on two different days. This place reminds me a lot of Rubios. The fishburger was all right, but dinner was very disappointing. The tacos and taco mountain had some white fish which was very dry and the fixings seemed to be loads of cabbage in mayo. The chicken burger turned out to be terrible, cold and dry. Overall decor is nice, food is a bit pricey and meh",1
" 13 ppl at one table 1 server n there was only 1 other table there n server dropped pork belly on my friends hat. then put it on the grill. didnt even say sorry, just laughed. He took forever to bring out our food too. meat came out one by one. n The sides were limited, not much variety n meat was okay. Nothing worth coming back for",1
"Great Place. The guys behind the Sushi Bar are so friendly. The food is good, the best thing is the happy hour the prices are unbeatable for what you get. Last night we had two rolls, yellow fin, appetizer, and large beer for 15 buck. I love Sushi Eye, but this is as good, and a lot closer to my house.",2
"Total rip off! n 16.95 for a banana creme pie. Recently, they changed the presentation of the pie to feature a dome of whipped cream. Once you cut in to enjoy the pie you soon find out it is 75 cream and maybe one or two bananas and some not so tasty yellow custard. After being a customer for ten years I will never go back. nYuck! Gross!",1
"Hawaiian and Filipino foods. First, the adobo omelette ! Very good! Adobo pork mixed with rice and then made into a huge omelette. Topsilog marinated beef with garlic fried rice 2 eggs. Portuguese sausilog is good too. Freshly cooked lumpia ! Yum yum! Good food and reasonable. Friendly staff with Hawaiian theme decor",2
"I really really love the custard at Freddy's. It's so creamy and they have a ton of creative flavor and ingredient combinations to choose from. The burgers are quite good, but the meat itself is super thin and crispy because of the way they smash it on the grill. That could be improved, but the overall flavor is great.",2
"I went to this place with a friend because the reviews were excellent on here and it was a block away from my place. Despite being so close to my place, I wont go back. The miso soup tasted sour.like rotten sour. The sushi wasnt bad but it was pretty small. Thats about it. I really hoped this could have been a regular spot for me get take out sushi, but I wont go back ",1
" ""No undergrads "" says it all. Madura has a lovely atmosphere with good music that you can still chat over! nThe staff are friendly and knowledgable on all drinks and cigars, and very willing to make suggestions and help out. nIt's an intimate location, could have reeked of pretension but was so approachable. Finding this gem made our night.",2
I have to say that I have been back twice in the last month since my last visit which was in the summer and was not incorrect in my suspicions that the new parking and street through the center would ruin the atmosphere. We used to visit several times a month but didn't even bother to visit during the holidays this last year.,1
"One of my favorite places in Vegas. The food is reliably awesome. The Kaba Moko is just happiness in your belly and I love the Roti Canai. So many options, and Anthony is always good enough to check up and ask how you feel about the food. Ruka is the hardest working server in show business. Show these people some love and come for some of the best food in town.",2
"Service A . Food B . There was beautiful seating outside next to the herb garden. I had the ribeye topped with Dungeness Crab on a bed of mushrooms and bacon. The steak was ok however the mushrooms were amazing. My wife had the sea bass which was less than stellar. I gave the overall rating four stars, but the food honestly was about three stars.",2

"Walked in and stood at the counter for 6 minutes. No one ever came up, 2 people walked by the register. No one said one word to me, so I walked out. Its 9 20. There was 2 cars total in the drive through and no one eating inside. No excuse for piss poor service. . I walked right next door and ate at Mcalisters.",1
"Miserable, through no fault of the staff. There was just something about this particular Target the worst, angriest, weirdest customers in the world just seem to flock here. There were shouting fights in the aisles and the family in front of me in line left an entire grocery cart full of merchandise there without paying and just walked out. Strange, terrible place, this Target.",1
Everything they say is true. Amazing and worth the wait. We had the pan roast. Made the mistake of sharing it with my husband. We will be back ordering one each next time. The steamed muscles were fresh and tasty in a butter wine garlic broth. Thinking of driving out to Vegas from San Diego just for that.,2
Sapporo is a great place for happy hour whether that be with friends or co workers. There are a decent amount of TV's so if you get dragged there during a game don't worry. They have Teppanyaki which we did not try but does give it more variety and a family style appeal. Patio seating available and if it is nice out sit outside for sure!,2
"Used my Groupon and was very happy with this find. Reasonably priced, very clean, and definitely a 'mom and pop shop'. I got the Polish plate 8.95 and would totally order it again. My friend got the sausage and peppers and that was tasty too! It's in the same plaza as Bono's and PT's if you are looking for it. Give it a try it's good ",2
"Just visiting from out of town and had dinner at this spot. Food was just what I needed combo pho . Hesitated because of the bad service reported in the previous reviews, but my experience was great. Service was fast, efficient and friendly. Only 4 stars since I am from out of town can't give 5 stars to a place I've only gone once.",2
"Must see for any art fan. I went to high school with a cousin of Warhol's, so I felt like a friend of the family walking around, haha. nGreat addition to the Pittsburgh Museum scene. I need to go back and check out current exhibits. My original trip was on a date with a girl that totally didn't get it. ha. One room has Punching Bag Jesus's and the next Suicide Photo's.",2
"This was a great hotel couple years ago, now is the redneck paradise. Hanging banners from all the walls of the pool ""5 cheap beers for 34 dollars "", a classy detail from the Paris management. Beer bottles floating on the pool. Rooms are dirty, old and furniture destroyed. nBefore you book here, do some research, some weekends are crazy expensive without any reason.",1
"This place is always busy. Some kind of gang graffiti scratched on the view window of almost every pump. The Fry's vip card does not work at the pump. At least mine doesn't. Generally the store is clean. Sometimes they are staffed, but usually you have to stand in some unorthodox type of line. Gas prices are usually a little higher here than at Fry's a mile down the road",1
"I have never been to the orginal in LA, but did have one from the OC Fair booth and it was bad! So to say I wasn't looking forward to this was a understatement, but it was good . We both got the hot dog burrito and we should have just got one cause that would have filled us both up. They have great fries also and cost a little bit but what doesn't in Vegas.",2
"5 stars is not enough to rate the Hash House. Seriously the wait was non existent, servers were helpful and friendly and the food left me speechless. My bf and I both ordered the 18oz rib eye. That's 18 whole ounces served on a bed of pumpkin mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly and tender and flavorful! This was an amazing experience love it!",2
"You caever go wrong with this place, the food is fresh and no matter the location, it always tastes the same. I have been a customer for the past 8 years and I'm always happy. Once in a while you'll get the new cook that somehow messes up the dish, but they are always fast to make up for it. Great service and good food served fast. I might add that some dishes are better here than in PF Changs!",2
"Good restaurant for Vegan. Plates are very well presented and looks and are yummy! The Chef must be very creative. I am not a vegan, far from that, but I really enjoyed my meal and the time I spend there. Must try once in your life, even if it's just for the experience. No wifi, and it's a little expensive cost me 45 for lunch but I guess it's part of the vegan deal.",2
"I was really impressed with the Phoenix Art Museum. I went there with Google and we had a private tourguide, a retired fireman who was very knowledgeable. The museum is filled with old fire engines and memorabilia from the olden days. We've come a long way in fire fighting technology. This is a great place to take pictures and you can even try on a firefighter outfit, helmet and all.",2
"I love GB for their Happy Hour and their Dragonberry Mojitos! I'm a huge fan of the tapas appetizer. I only wish they had more vegetarian items on the menu. Great ambiance, great service.will continue to be one of our ""go to "" places near home. Update 5 15 12 They've changed their menu and added a vegetarian and vegan section! Love it!",2
"If you are looking for a FANTASTIC lawn care company, call Ultimate Lawn Maintenance. These guys are good. The are the best in Las Vegas that I have found. A few weeks ago, I had a sprinkler head break and within a few hours it was replaced along with adjusting timer and every other sprinkler head. The price was fantastic. If your looking for true professionals call these guys!",2
"Good fast food. We liked it here but it was the owner we couldn't get over. When we disagreed with her choice on politics which she brought up she basically called us dumb and lectured us for 30 minutes. My friend and I don't feel very comfortable eating here and if we had to, we'd get our orders to go.",1
"This Sprint store had HORRIBLE customer service. My fianc u00e9 and I were just in there, and the man was extremely rude to us. I've had Sprint for over a decade, and I am thinking about leaving because of him. The woman right before us was practically in tears before she left. Like I said HORRIBLE customer service.",1
"I was really disappointed with this mall. I went in to kill some time and I couldn't shop at any of the stores. They were either all for teenagers or people with families. They had this one over priced ""boutique "" that sold expensive skanky dresses. If the dress barely covers my a , it shouldn't cost 80 . I'm going else where.",1
"Pretty nice place, but staff could be rude and argumentive. I had and eye infection, when in like 5 times for the same thing, the drops that the doctor prescribed never worked all five times. Went to cvs got some over the canter eye drops. Took about week and half and my eyes have no more infection.",1
"Best place in the northwest! The staff is incredible! Jaime is hands down the best anywhere! The food is amazing and if you want something a little different, they will create something for you! The truffle pizza is to die for! They remember you and you always feel at home. This is a weekly institution!",2
"After hearing about this place on my HOA fb group I had to check it out.WOW! Not only were they super friendly, but they brought out all kinds of samples! Great sweet and savory flavors! I picked up two of their ""small "" bags that I thought were pretty generous for about 8 total. Perfect for adding to a gift basket. He even threw in toothpicks aapkins in the bag great local business!",2
"OMG, I'm very happy to find something to replace long lost California Taco in my heart and in my stomach. Very casual and fine with us BYOBing. Most importantly, we all were very happy with the food which did not have that typical mid western Mexican food taste. Ironically, I've never seen a surcharge for the vegetarian version, but no complaints as it was well worth it.",2
"As good as they say. 5 star burger, and not just by Pittsburgh standards. Dry bleu cheese. Steak salad, spinach salad with steak are also good. I used to say this is the only restaurant in Pittsburgh. Good food, professional service, a nice ambiance a bar with a tin ceiling and even a bit of view of the street and hills. And alcohol.",2
"almost like the Fashion Show Mall except you see drunk chicks stumbling around trying to text their bff's. didn't really go around much, i was sick and tired of checking out malls. they had ""fcuk "" i haven't seen that clothing line in almost 10 years since it came out. . it's a nice place to cool off though. and man they have free Wi Fi inside. ",2
"These people are just screwups. Ordered the miso soup, listed on the menu as having tofu and scallions. No tofu or scallions, but tons of mushrooms. Also got the veggie burger which is listed with sweet potato fries, but no fries came with it. The only reason they get two stars is because it was a delicious veggie burger.",1
"Good lunch but a little pricy for my taste. The employees were extremely friendly and very helpful. Checked on us twice to make sure everything was well. I had the white rice teriyaki bowl with pork and tofu. tofu was good, pork was very good and the vegetables were fresh and a good variety. I'll be back to try something different.",2
There really isn't a huge difference in any of the Harkins theaters. We go for the dollar drinks with the cup and the popcorn coupons with the shirt it's worth the price each year if you go to a lot of movies. The only difference I can really see in this one is the employees are more pleasant than at other locations. I'm sure the child care place is also a great draw for parents of younger ones.,2
Dirty! Smelly! Walked in and the first thing that hit me was the smell.omg! Cigarette and toilet piss. no joke i felt like I walked into a freaking smokers house . All the tables were filthy dirty. wth! Dissatisfaction to the fullest. I just hope the owner wakes the fuck up and turns this place around. food was good tho. nPs no fumen en el restaurante pendejos.!,1
"I had an existing antenna and just needed one of my tv's hooked up with new coax cable. Sabrina did a fantastic job! I don't know the name of the other person with her but they both were extremely professional and efficient. I was very pleased with their services and pricing. I would recommend Mr. Antenna, they did an awesome job!",2
"Had a first date here and didn't know it at the time. Don't live in Phx anymore, and don't live with the girl anymore. Some of the best pizza I ever had. We shared a Margarita pizza.delicious. Yea, best pizza and she is still one of my best friends. Great place to eat, great place to shop next door.",2
"Wasn't at all like I remembered. Only some of the girls were attractive, one had her bf in the audience which made it really awkward for anyone to get a dance from her. Wasn't happy with this time. Maybe it was a bad night but for a Friday, it sure seemed dead and didn't have the top girls unless those were then there is a bigger issue .",1
"Resturant prices at a 'fast food ish' type place. but the quality is worth it. Everything is super fresh and they pay attention to detail. I love the food, black bean soup is addicting and the salads are super fresh and loaded with veggies. Good casual place that is kid friendly, has wi fi and an amazing dessert bread selection. If you want to sit, relax and eat perfect spot.",2
"This is the worst internet service that I have ever used. I've lived in Korea and the service was 10x better. My service is intermittent at best, constant outages, poor customer service and they charge 5 for their crap modem. The only reason I'm with them is because of the DirecTV bundle. Explore other options!",1
"The atmosphere was great, the biscuits with the jam I'm not a bread lover was pretty good BUT do you know what turned me off.this dish I ordered that was supposed to be.I don't know what it was but it was eggs on the bottom with shredded beef on top. Least, to say complete turn off and I haven't been back since. The grits tasted like they were cooked in milk.wasn't a fan. I've had better brunch.",1
We were told that the wait was only 15 20 minutes and we ended up waiting for 45 minutes! We were all just waiting there while others that just arrived passed us by. I finally decided to complain and that's when they finally put their heads together and set up a table for us. Worst place for a Sunday Brunch! Food was ok.not worth the wait.,1
"The sushi wasn't bad by any means, but i definitely felt like it was really overpriced for the quality. I think our bill came out to about 80. I'd say it felt like it was probably worth more like 50. having said that, the servers were nice and they were very fast with out food, but i feel like either the portions were to small of their prices were just too high.",1
"1st time so I had the Signature Menu. Caviar, French Red Mullet, Artichoke Black Truffle soup, Beef tenderloin, amazing cheeses, breads, desserts, etc. Service of course top notch, atmosphere elegant. This was my dates 1st Michelin star experience and it has ruined her. Can't take her anywhere without ""it good but Guy Suvoy's., """,2
"Undrinkable coffee. Sorry to the hipster doofus crowd but the coffee is horrible. made the mistake of listening to others who suggested this place while taking some friends from Europe through the downtown redevelopment. None of us was willing to take a second sip, our first tasting so awful. Better to grab your coffee at Lux instead.",1
"I don't understand why they wouldn't implement crowd control. It's a tiny dance floor, there's absolutely no room for dancing. The most we were able to muster was an awkward wiggling. The only redeeming quality was access to the second level for a nighttime view of the Strip, but that was crowded too. We stayed for exactly 15 minutes, and I will not be going back.",1
"This place is to good! Went in expecting to be okay with the food and left a loyal customer. Although I don't live in LV I will make this place a must have on every single trip. Great, homemade food items and friendly staff. I had the half smothered chicken and my husband had the meatloaf. Both were delicious and worth the wait! Must try while in town!",2
"Love this spot! The staff are often very busy as the place is hopping, but they always handle it extremely well and service is super quick. nYummy food, relaxed atmosphere, you pay for the quality you get, like in any coffee place restaurant bistro caf u00e9, so no complaints about the prices! nAlways a great place to wind down or start the day, right by the university campus too! nMy new haven.",2
No one likes going to the doctor. And Urgent Care I know doesn't necessarily mean that it's like a drive thru. But 2 hours in the waiting room in agonizing pain without the receptionist so much as looking up was bad enough. That they took the copay before even getting my name or what was wrong was worse. I never saw a doctor. I made them refund the copay and went to UMC instead. Thanks for nothing,1
"One of my favorite places on the Strip. The food is nice and I love the potato Frite's, they are like the super skinny, thin and crispy crunchy fries you look for. The service staff is extremely gracious and lovely. Wherever you are seated within the restaurant its got charm and great atmosphere! I will be back here every single time I come to Las Vegas, I am planning on it!",2
Dr. Beals is fantastic! I have had all 3 of my kids 4 wisdom teeth each removed within the last 30 days! Also one kid had 2 baby teeth removed and anchors attached during the same surgery. Beals is great with pre op instructions and followup. The kids liked him. The girls up front are awesome. No one likes surgery . but we recommend Dr. Beals!,2
"We ate here on a Saturday night for a late night snack. The place is cute and good for people watching, but the food was disappointing. We had the french dip, hotdog and fries. Everything was on the expensive side and not very good. We would not eat here again. This was the third restaurant we tried at the Wynn and all were overpriced and mediocre.",1
"No! Absolutely not! Never, ever again! I live in town and wanted to spend an evening downtown walk around Fremont, get polluted, etc. and decided to get a room here. This is NOT the place to stay! The casino floor is nice, the bars are decent, but unfortunately the rooms include FREE BED BUGS! Took a cab home at 3am, and no. they would not refund the room cost.",1
"Some of the best service and food that I've had in Vegas. The servers are attentive but still give diners their space a rare trait. Tried the ribeye, splurged on the caviar and had the wedge salad. All were impeccable and delicious. Dinner was so good that I almost forgot that I was at a work function. Yum.",2
This is a great place for sports watching! Tons of televisions so you can see from anywhere in the bar. The food is just average although the grilled wings are pretty tasty. Beers were reasonably priced and service was great. They even had a free raffle that my husband won Cardinal's tickets from! This place is a long time favorite of my husbands and I'm sure we'll be back.,2
I'm visiting my family currently . Its really hard for me to trust people doing my nails and I looked around on yelp to find a great place to do my nails. This place is seriously a gem . Tina did my nails how I wanted them and took her time . She was really talkative and really sweet ! thank you . I'll be defiantly coming back again !,2
"Robert has worked on my guitars for over 30 years. He is hands down the best in the valley when it comes to guitar repair. The guitar repair section of the store is all I have used. The rest of the store has some music instruments for sale, and for rent. Local stores like this are much better to deal with than your big corporate stores. Better service, better quality thank you Robert!",2
"I love this Best Buy in Henderson. The staff is very friendly and the managers are very helpful. The location is located very convienently next to costco, galleria mall and about a mile away from target and toys r us. Their price matching plan is pretty robust and they do match newegg and amazon. Since, amazon started charging taxes, this has been my go to place for electronics.",2
We heard good things about this place so we decided to try it. Nice atmosphere inside and the wait staff very courtious. We had the Ribeye and Chicken Parmesan. The Ribeye was very disappointing. It was just ok. No seasonings or flavor. Just plain. Chicken parmesan was ok. We paid alot of money for an average meal. Don't mind paying for a good steak. This place didn't fit the bill.,1
"Stopped here for a quick to go order for lunch on our last day at vegas before driving to airport.got vegetable Biryani.and that was awesome, wish we had known about this place earlier, would have definitely tried the buffet and other dishes. the dinning area looked good and the hosts were very warm too. Would surely visit whenever in vegas the next time.",2
"This store has great stuff in it and we all complemented the woman working on how great the store was when we were leaving. I was with 3 white people and 1 black person. When we left, the worker pulled the black person aside and demanded to check his pockets. She did and found nothing. In the middle of the Strip District, this store can still be racist?",1
"Very upsetting! Park 51 cafe is under new management. Some of the new staff not near as friendly. Norman, who has been there over 20 years is gone. He was always quick to fill tea and bring out food if the waitresses were busy. My husband and I started coming here when we were dating. Now we need to find another breakfast place.",1
I would have given it less but they did comp our bad meal. Ordered filet with crab stuffed prawns and the stuffing tasted like it had been left out. The manager who never gave her name tried to tell me that they where fine to eat. They really undercooked my husbands steak and desert was served in a very dirty bowl. We went in because we had gift cards. I guess we will be giving it another try.,1
I just had service on my car. They quote great prices. I had a check engine light and they looked at it for free. It turned out to be a gas cap. They also replaced a leaking fuel line. The price was exactly as quoted. I will take all my vehicles here. The customer service is great.! The owners are friendly and know their stuff.,2
this place is disgusting. the food is gross both in terms of how much they give you and how it tastes. the windowless interior adds nothing to the experience. I don't know why anyone would give this more than one star. i would like to give it negative stars if i could. it's a house of gross gluttony.,1
"This is my favorite place to eat Chinese food on campus. Golden Harbor might have a little bit better tasting food but this is about half the price. You can't go wrong with any schezuan beef or brocoli and beef. Also, I would highly recommend the Dry Chili Chicken off the Chinse menu. That dish is amazing.",2
"Fun Atmosphere if you sit on the patio, the inside is a little bit overkill for my taste. I had the taco salad, husband had the Elvis plate. The food was good and the service was prompt and friendly. Unfortunately we knocked ourselves out on unlimited chipes and salsa before our meals came out and didnt get to enjoy all of our meals Oh well, theres always next time.",2
"If you need to find some good mens clothes dress or casual at a reasonable price give this place a shot. Great selection of shirts, pants, suites, outerwear and shoes. If you're like me and need some style help ask for Zina! She really does at great job at getting to know you and selecting choices that will fit your style and occasion.",2
"No food is good enough to make up for the horrible service I got. With only a couple of customers ahead of me, I waited nearly a half an hour for two to go meals. It was absolutely absurd because the cooks who I could see were goofing around and nobody seemed to care. If you have unlimited time to stand around waiting, the food is good. My time is valuable and it's not worth it for me.",1
Parking is terrible and location hidden in the corner. It gets better from there. Variety of food good. Fresh and good quality. Good portions are served and price is good for quality and quantity. Atmosphere is old deli style that everyone wants to be at. Food is good service is good. Worthy of repeats.,2
"I used to work at this place a long time ago, and went back recently. The food is as good as ever, the service is fantastic, the prices are reasonable, and the owner is hot. What more could you want? I highly recommend the turkey, the prime rib, and the spareribs. i'm not a rib eater, and the spare ribs are the best I've ever had.you won't be sorry, I promise!",2
"Cheap drinks.make that cheap strong drinks, Christmas lights coming out the wazoo, live music, quick and speedy bartenders, indoor outdoor kick it area and a nice blended crowd. This time of year you cannot tell what a true dive bar this is since the xmas lights make it ohh soooo purrrddyyyy BUT it is a dive bar, a wonderful decorated dive bar that can't help but put you in a cheery mood ",2
"My jaw dropped as I walked into this amazing store! This store holds products that not every generic supermarket has. I felt as though it was a combination of Vons, 99 Ranch Market and Cardenas all rolled into one amazing store! Chefs and culinary students like myself could find anything you need to make an exquisite meal!",2
"Allodile Construction is by far our contractor of choice. Not only is Niall one of the friendliest people you will meet, his attention to detail, craftsmanship, punctuality, etc. etc. etc. is unbeatable. As an interior design firm, Allodile Construction is our 1 general contractor for remodeling, additions, and home improvement projects large and small.",2
"This is one of your typical hole in the wall type local restaurants. It's just a small eatery not very chic, and not in the best location for foot traffic. But I consider it to be one of the best Sushi spots in Phoenix. The service is great, prices are fair, and the food is wonderful. No frills, just nice fresh sushi! Try coming in for lunch, to catch their specials.",2
"The Garage has a beer and wine selection that is above average though not remarkable by any stretch of the imagination. The burgers are weak, but I would recommend trying one of their salads, which are some of the best I have had in the valley. Good job with the interior. During the winter months, the bar area opens onto a small patio.",2
"No drink menu, very small and weak selection of beers, very bland food. The focaccias are dry and come in a stale tortilla. The burgers are unseasoned and bland, it's like chewing meat your 6 year old made. Onion rings and French fries are soggy. The only redeeming factor is their wings, and those are pretty expensive at 1 a piece.",1
I made an appointment to get a flu shot here. got several emails telling me not to forget and when I showed up at 8 am on a Monday morning a girl shrugs her shoulders and tells me they are not doing flu shots that day. after I missed two hours of work this sucks. never going to cvs again it is always a bad idea no matter which location you go to.,1
"First of all the service was BAD! nIt took 15 minutes to take the drink order. After 30 minutes I received my 1 roll of sushi that was questionably fresh, and after 45 minutes I gave up on the 2 ramen soups I ordered. nThey are 5 times bigger than Monta but only had 2 servers. I don't care how good this food is supposed to be I'd never refer anyone to this place, let alone come back.",1
"There was weird pictures of the owner at war, probably about 20 30 pictures not the most appetizing thing when eating. Pictures of blown up cars and him holding guns also the Fattoush salad was very substandard and the dressing was tasteless. And there was an eyelash in our food. But it's an ok place for a cheap meal.",1
"My daughter loves to draw and paint, there was a place like this back home that we used to go to all the time, so glad to have found this place so we can continue to enjoy painting art pieces for the people we love. They do birthday party's for kids as well. The owner was really nice we will be back.",2
"I love any kind of Asian food, but this just wasn't good. Service extremely slow. Wonton soup 8.00 and tasteless. They gave us salt and pepper? We had to ask for soy sauce? Noodle dish expensive and didn't seem fresh. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Much better and less pricey alternatives in Vegas.",1
This walmart is so clean.u don't feel weird leaving ur car unattended and not feel like it was going to get broken into.The people are nicer and everything is very open easy to find. .i just stumbled across this walmart last night and I'm will drive to this one the people who shop there are better.Some walmart you don't want to leave your car too long .nicer neighborhood,2
"I love this place because they have the most beers on tap in the area. Dead Guy IPA is my personal favorite. I've always liked BJ's for their food, but I will admit that I usually go for their high calorie salads, soup and beer. The Ahi Tuna Salad is delightful and the main thing I get here. nThe other things to consider nChopped Salad nThai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps nSanta Fe Spring Rolls",2
"Really disappointed by the food. I've been to several of Emerile's places and this one is not up to par. I should have left when I saw the stained carpet in the bar and had to clean off the seat at my table. My cold lobster salad was rubbery, My fried chicken and waffles were so sweet I couldn't eat them. Very sad to see this place so run down",1
"The rooms we check in had dirty smell sock left from a previous guess. Bathroom was dirty, toilet had piss stain on the seat and hair in the sink. Another room had a glass with water and lip stain on it. Horrible service. everyone seem to be in a bad mood. They were very rude. NEVER coming back here again.",1
"This is one of my favorite Targets in town. It's clean, organized and fully stocked. My favorite thing at Target is usually the clothes clearance section and they have some serious racks to browse through. The employees are cheerful and friendly, which is another plus. All in all, great Target in town.",2
I was thoroughly disappointed with the lack of service my friend and I received as well as the food. It wasn't as good as I've heard it to be. I had the andy sage fried chicken with potatoes and my friend had the kokomo burger sandwich. I had so much leftover that I took it to go and gave it to a homeless person because I didn't want to waste the food. pretty disappointed.,1
Decided to try this place for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised! I got a chicken teriyaki vegetable bowl and half a California roll. More food than I needed but I wanted to try the sushi. The chicken teriyaki is delicious! The sushi is pretty good considering that this is fast food. The service was great my order was up fast. I will definitely be back!,2
"Pleasantly surprised at pretty much everything great food, wide selection of wines, and warm atmosphere. I've had LGO's pizza, and this is better. Haven't had Bianco's yet but apparently they won an award for best alternative to pizzeria Bianco. Will be back for sure, and if I like it again will give it 5 stars.",2
"EXCELLENT TACOS! My first vist, this place is friendly and the food was great. They even have a fountain outside that keeps the atmosphere under the tent cool. Good locatioext to a Coffee shop that has great coffee and the help speaks great english and doesn't get mad becuase you're white. Drive thru so yea I love this place already!",2
"The worst branch! There is always a line, and you always have to wait to speak to a business banker. They are so understaffed here. The branch manager always asks me how am I doing and what he can do to better my experience but the experience is never different! Get a clue! The only person who knows what they are doing is val.",1
"Truly. Meh. The Cutter's Cigar Bar is nice, so I had high expectations. Well, you know the rest of the story. I guess the idea was to let the hotel guests in shorts and colorful polos eat there because Charlotte has nothing better to offer? Not. Almost everywhere else in Charlotte center city is better.",1
The breakfast menu here is epic. So many things to pick from. I went with the breakfast burrito which was huge! the service here was great and they kept filling my cup of apple juice up. The decor was cowboy americana style which was pretty cool coming from the southeast northeast. I enjoyed the food very much.,2
"My husband and I found this place by accident and how lucky was that! The service was outstanding from the second we walked in the door. The bar was comfortable without a doubt. The drinks were amazing! We were rocking there Old Fashion Moonshine cocktail which was fabulous, then the food came out to complete the package. Delicious and filling! Highly recommend ",2
"Great flights for great prices. When I fly from Cleveland to California, I caever get a direct flight. Also only drinks and snacks on the flight. I do like the free bags, and have never been given an impossible transfer to make like on US Air . I like their sense of humor, and the service is great. I always try to fly southwest",2
"I've been meaning to go back to this place for over a year now but I finally did today. nGot the same thing I did the first time Meat Lover's omelette with added hollandaise sauce and it was still great. Fast, friendly service, low prices two people omelette and a burrito with a coffee and an orange juice for 29 with tip and excellent food. I wish I lived closer so I could dine here more often!",2
"Having lived in Thailand I feel that I know what authentic Thai is and what ""westernized "" Thai is and this place stays true to Thai food. The Kaprow was just as good as I would get from the street vendors in front of my apartment as was the Som Tom. Will definitely be back to get my favorite dishes from back in Thailand. Bonus is that they have perfectly cooked sticky rice",2
"This review is only for the photo processing. I had 4 rolls developed and scanned to a single disk with no prints. 3 rolls were 36 exp color film and one roll was slide film. I paid a little over 100 ! Had I been told that I'd be charged over 25 a roll for no prints , I would've never dropped off film. Ridiculous.",1
"Their hours are not the most convenient, and they don't pay for glass, but they're the most convenient place on the east side and their staff is friendly. You can also drop off lots of stuff that they won't pay for, but at least you're recycling. They pay for cans and plastic bottles and maybe some other things, but that's all I ever bring .",2
"I'm honestly shocked people didn't rate this higher. Burrito Boyz is awesome. A small is more than enough food, the hot sauce is super hot I'm up to six drops! and the ingredients are great. I think its way better than chipotle's Try either one of the fish burritos its a little different but they're really good. Great drunk food! Get one with everything!",2
"One of THE most beautiful churches I've ever seen.and I've been to some of the most famous cathedrals in Europe. The nave has intricately carved spiral stairs, blue stained glass windows.take the tour. Don't forget to see the wedding chapel through the door at the very front of the church it's very bright and WHITE and breathtaking.",2
WOW! the beer really is cold. 29 degrees as advertised. they even have a temperature scoreboard that let's you see what the degrees are! i love me some icy beer! mozza sticks are fabulous and the chicken fried steak is huge.enough for two people. so happy this place opened near my house. i want to try the outdoor seating next to the firepits!,2
"Yikes, you get what you pay for. There were stains on the box spring that looked like someone got their brains blown out. Also, nasty stains on the chairs. Looked like people were living long term in a tiny room. I can't see how that would be good for Baymont's business. I'd give it 0 stars if it were possible.",1
"One of the worst steakhouse I've ever ate at. Dirty dishes and knives to begin with. Had 3 of my friends order medium rare and it came out brown. Told the manager, he had the chef to start a new order, and it came out again well done. I was speechless. How do you mess up the order twice? For a steakhouse this is pathetic. If your cooks can't cook steaks . Please consider a new profession.",1
"With so few places out here, we've been waiting or a place that has cold beer and good bar food. Burgers were cooked to correct temperature and tasty. Lots of ingredients and flavors in all dishes. Was clean on dining room side with attentive wait staff. nWill definitely return when feeling like beer, sports, and good bar food.",2
Do not go here for a migraine I took my girl in and all they did was a shot of ibuprofen torridol and Fennegan for nausea and a note for work we came here because she needs something for these flair ups not just a shot and go after I told them she has had ibuprofen 800 so that mixed with the torridol could cause renal failure,1
".I don't get the Costco phenomenon.not one bit. Admittedly not one with a huge family, but without a doubt the sort who buys and eats in bulk the prices here simply aren't that much better than those at Super Target or Walmart and with their limited hours 24 hr at Walmart you're almost always guaranteed to hit a crowd.",1
I came here with a group of friends on a saturday night for one of our dear friends birthday. The staff was nice and our chef Jose was entertaining. He took time to ensure that our group was having fun. I ordered ordered the new York steak which was tender and cooked to medium rare as requested. I would definitely come back for the food and Jose's cooking.,2
"I really wanted to like this place. It has a very hip ambiance, no doubt. In the end, the quality of the food is just not that great. It fell below the expectations I had based on the vibe and decor. The quality of the food, the ingredients used, reminded me of what is normally served in cafeterias. In the end, as much as Scramble is a cool place, I have to choose food over the look.",1
"Came in there with completely shot brakes on my front two tires. They explained to me exactly what was wrong, showed where the rotors were damaged beyond use, and worked with me to find the best price. The manager even threw on an extra discount and coupon for me since I'm a broke recent grad. I usually stay away from big name auto repair companies, but these are some trustworthy guys over here",2
"Ridiculous price for what you get. The 'wedge' is presented in 2 pieces, each an inch thick. Way too small for a steakhouse. My 20oz prime ribeye was bathed in butter. While it was a nice cut of meat, I have a butter coma. Way too much butter taste. For the money go across the street to Mastro's City Hall. You will walk out with one of the best meals of your life, and it won't cost much more.",1
"Authentic Flavors at ok prices. I have no complaints here. Perfect location for a great meal and movie afterwards. My only complaint about this place is that sometimes it may take a while for the staff to bring you your check.important if you are going to the movie afterwards and want to get there on time, LOL.",2
A large menu and great to eat at with a group since it offers something for everyone. The Sunday Night Pasta is great! We had the buffet breakfast and found it to be a reasonable price compared to the other buffets that cost more and offer way too much food. It is open late which is a plus. We looked all over the Wynn and Encore for someplace to eat and nothing was open late.,2
"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Coach, Charlotte Russe, White Black clothes shop, Aldo, Adidas, Kate Spade, Puma, Banana Republic! We spent a good 5 hours here. And walked out with some amazing deals! I agree with Cynthia A. that they could have better food options. But we just cabbed it to I Out on our way back to the strip instead. Will be back, the next time I'm in Vegas.",2
"Brandon and his team were just like the rest of the reviews mentioned on time, fast, careful, professional and really friendly. nMy boyfriend and I bought a new house, so we had not one but two houses we needed to move into our new two story house. We had 4 movers and they were fantastic. Nothing got lost or damaged. It was a great experience we would highly recommend them",2
"I was so excited because of all the good reviews but I was very disappointed. Overall, the food was very expensive and the portions were tiny. I didn't think it tasted better than the other Thai restaurants I've been to. Maybe I came on an off day too because the service was extremely slow and a little rude.",1
"Wow my sister and I ate for only 17 dollars because we had a buy 1 get free coupon. nThis buffet has a little of everything Italian ,oriental, barbecue, international, Mexican food. I had a salad and humus freshly made along with chicken jambalaya. Finally for desert ice cream mint n chip and cheese cake. Dollar for dollar the best deal in vegas.",2
"What a waste of time. We came on the last day, the Glendale Glitters ""and Glow "". This reminded me of a carnival but without the rides. The crowds were horrific, parking sucked, and there were lots of disgusting, fried food eateries and cheap vendors lining the park. My husband, 15 mo old son and I got some kettle corn and quickly left.",1
We stayed four days at the SLS Hotel n Casino. On our last night we ate here. The food is excellent n they give u large portions. The waiter brought me a second plate so I could cut my pancakes in fourths and eat more smaller portions of it. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was relaxing. If you get a chance put this on your list of places to eat.,2
"Totally hole in the wall type of restaurant. I had a calamari appetizer and pad thai. The calamari was really good but the sauce needs to be a bit spicier. The pad thai was not great, the noodles was too chewy. I thought it was undercooked. The price is perfect, not that expensive for their lunch specials. BUT quality is just not that good for me.",1
"We ordered a Bobbie and a Turkey sandwich. The place was dirty and the bread was dry and old. The Bobbie is the sandwich I really wanted to try, and it was awful. The inside of it was kinda frosty too. The turkey sandwich had dry bread too. I gave them 2 stars because the boys working there were nice. Maybe this location is different than the rest? I will never go back!",1
"This restaurant is simply one of the best breakfast restaurants in town. US Egg has great pricing, amazing food, and a super friendly staff. We've been eating here for years and have never had a bad experience. My husband will tell you to try the pancakes, I'll tell you to try an omelette. Either way, I'm pretty sure you win.",2
"Great service, good wings, they keep your drinks coming, and I like country they were playing it the entire time I was there don't think that's something they do all the time. I think I just got lucky you can't really mess up wings tho unless you over cook them or under cook them. Didn't blow me away but I'll definitely be back.",2
"The BEST! INEXPENSIVE! PROMPT! I had cracked my iPad mini screen and had shopped around for replacements. Everyone else wanted 150, IDoctor AZ only charged me 90! I was skeptical as he operated out of Water and Ice, but business is business! Quick, professional and great service! Would ABSOLUTELY go back again and recommend to anyone!",2
"I generally like BW's I'm a sucker for the mango habenero. I like that they have kids night on Wednesday but the service seems to be lousy even for a sports bar. The kicker is that last time we went they didn't have trivia! Part of the reason we go is to play trivia against each other. The drinks are yummy, but overpriced for the amount of actual booze you are getting in their mixed drinks.",1
Located on the westside way up by Desert Inn and Durango Sen of Japan is cool find. The restaurant is big with plenty of room but with minimal decor and hard chairs. nWe ordered two of the Omakase 52 and some sushi items. The Omakese was good except for the generic fish that came with the sushi course. The last course of molten chocolate cake was excellent.,2
Haha It was a funny experience at this restaurant. My friend ordered the 4 patties burger! I ordered the 2 patties burger and my other friend ordered the 3 patties burger. Customer service is not top notch but it was ok. I will come back to this place whenever I'm in Vegas to enjoy a funny experience again. lol,2
"This place is just wonderful. Absolutely the best hummus I've ever had it's so creamy! The fresh pitas are to die for, and the owner who I believe has rung me up every time I've been is a really nice guy when I was deciding what to get today, he gave me a sample of the homemade baklava, which was dissolve in your mouth delicious. Amazing place, wish it was a little closer to my house!",2
"Joe offers amazing customer service and even better quality in all of his products. His design team can pretty much come up with a solution to any situation whether it's transforming the look of your office space, or putting up a new marquee. I would highly recommend Spotlight Signs and Imaging Solutions!",2
"This place is owned by Luigi see Luigi's Pizza http www.yelp.com biz luigis pizza charlotte 3 and its a pretty cool place. The food was great, the service was excellent and the prices were fair. If you go be sure to have the specials since they are really fantastic. If you don't already know about Luigi's other locations be sure to grab a Pizza at any of them since you have been missing out.",2
"My husband and I met some friends last Saturday night, walk right in and got a table.no wait! Our first time eating here so was not sure how it was going to be.pleasantly surprised! I had the chicken pesto pasta and it was delicious, my husband loved his ravioli. Reasonably priced had a special buy one pasta, get one half off. Will be back!",2
My wife and I go here for haircuts and waxing. The rates are spot on and the customer service is excellent. I thought as a guy it would feel weird going to a salon instead of a barber for a haircut but everyone is really cool so I feel comfortable. The vibe of the Salon is unique and fun. If you live in Scottsdale or Phoenix this is the place to go fo sho!,2
"Michael is a promoter for Encore Surrender, and his number is 702 401 2027 for open bars, covers, guestlists, and all that good stuff for the girls. Reserve seperately for a place to sit. I'm not really sure if I should be giving out this guy's number but everyone should be able to experience the prettiness that is Encore Beach Club!",2
"If I had my way I would give Binkley's 10 stars! nFood, hospitality and attention everything top notch! nI am a BIG time foodie and always looking for new places to try, ever since being to Binkley's no other restaurant can match upto this experience! Always a delight, always a pleasure when the chef himself is so warm and caring for the customers' needs. I loooveee Binkley's! ",2
"Nice family restaurant. Good food, nice portions, good quality ingredients and fair prices. I had the BLT and it was real yummy, thick cut bacon and even the tomatoes were good. their beer batter onion rings are some of the best I have had. They have a great breakfast menu too. can't wait to go back.",2
I didn't think Diablo would be a good choice for lunch after reading about 50 of their reviews but others in our group wanted to go. The reviews are correct. We left with the feeling we paid way to much considering the food service we received. Huge lack off attention to us and other customers around us. I would say you have a 50 chance of leaving happy.,1
One of the best beer selections in the city. They now have a full liquor license as well which should appeal to the those who like a stiffer drink. Open mic or bands are usually playing on the weekend for entertaining Live music. The food next door attached at El Taco Feliz is also amazing and puts this spot over the top. Why aren't you there yet? Go see Stan and his awesome crew!,2
The food was fantastic! The cashiers were friendly. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because it took some time to get my order although they were very busy! I understand to a point as they cook everything fresh to order. Next time I will call in my order. Love the spicy chicken and chicken teriyaki.,2
"Such a fun atmosphere! The frozen hot chocolate was delicious. I like how the coffee bar area is seperate from the sandwich lunch area, I think that makes traffic easier. The eating area is delightful too because they the tables set up with napkins and silverware already. Their Foursquare special is great too! 5 off 30 grocery purchase.",2
"There are many good inexpensive places to to eat but this isn't one of them. I'll admit the food was slightly above average but if this place is going to make it the girl behind the counter needs to go elsewhere. She acts as if she could careless if helps you or not. She has a very arrogant attitude. We will not be returning, low quality and bad service.",1
"I ordered the filetatilla salteado with yuca mojo instead of the rice and beans. It was OK. The food came out cold but the server gladly offered to reheat it. Nice service but the food was sub par. Nothing the average cook couldn't make at home. My server was very nice. Bottom line average food, good service.",1
"If you don't know about this place, you are missing out. For one, the prices are very cheap. Second, the food is amazing. Best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had. Breakfast burritos are amazing as well. Another great thing about this place is the menu. There is a very large selection. While this place may look like Filibertos, a Phoenix staple, its food is far superior.",2
"I put an order in advance over the phone with owner requesting that the chicken be well done. Instead chicken was under cooked and he refused to replace the chicken saying that next time he'll cook it well done, lmao. Never going back. They'll let anybody open up a business in this country, or is Church's just desperate.",1
"RECOMMENDED Smashburger rocks! The food is made fresh and to order. The staff is super friendly. It's no surprise that this chain is expanding fast. My personal favorite is the Truffle Mushroom Swiss Big Smash! The organic arugula adds the perfect flavor. If I've been extra good, I'm happy to reward myself with either their smash fries or a butterfinger hand spun milkshake.",2
I don't get it they just started charging an extra 25 cents per item on top of the regular price when you order between the hours of 9pm to 5am. When I asked the cashier why she just said its business. well if you ask me its bad business! They did just added slot machines? Are these extra fees to cover the small video poker winings?,1
"I've been eating Barro's since 1994. I'm sad to say, this location does not have things in order. From our lipstick lined wine glasses, to our frozen ravioli, and our antipasta salad coming out after my family was ready to leave, we will not be coming back. nThank goodness the pizza was still delicious.",1
Love this place! First time I went I sat at the sushi bar and was greeted by a chef named Chris. He made me all kinds of different specialty rolls and sashimi it was so delicious! nGreat saki specials very nice staff. Nice place to take somone on a date or even bring your family! Must try in order to see how amazing everything tastes!,2
"First time was not great, Tried again and definitely nothings changed. Hard rice small rolls crap happy hour. The best is Shaggy preparing the sushi. WTF, Really a young white dude? The two stars is for the waitress who was by herself and obviously trying. Meh, I'm gonna skip and head to Stingray or Toyama.",1
It was a nice evening and headed for work then suddenly the manager called saying we are close today. I never had eaten that day because I though I was already late. nPassed by this wendy's so I went inside and had a meal. nThe only thing that was really bad wendy's was their service. The food here was a little good. The place was also recommendable but the service is not.,1
"They have no soap dispensers in the restrooms, therefore the pizza guy molding your dough doesn't have the opportunity required to flipping wash hands! Otherwise the service was great, the happy hour drinks cheap, the food good, they could save money by not sending out a whole loaf of bread for a cheesy bread appetizer that only costs 3 .1 star for no soap!",1
"We saw all the mixed reviews and were a little hesitant, but we were pleasantly surprised. The nan station was awesome. Seafood was pretty fresh. Overall everything was pretty good. The only thing that wasn't great was some of the desserts were really dry, like the coconut macaroons for example. The two whoopie pies were really good though. I wanted to try the gelato but was too stuffed!",2
Im working with this guys last couple years. They are great. They do my bakery s printings signs and etc. He is really talented guy satisfies me with the designs. Always on time. I will definitely recommend him because i believe he spends more time doing the job and charging really less. As a proof you can go to Manan Bakery s web page and check out his designs.,2
"I shop craft stores for fine art supplies. Hobby Lobby, while way more organized, is always priced 2 3 more than Michael's for the same merchandise handled the same way poorly . nI only go here when I can't find it at Michael's, or I have a gift card that needs to be used. please no more gift cards here. omg please. lol",1
"Hands down, easily, no questions about it Montreal's best coffee bar. Phenomenal beans 49th Parallel, Ritual, Phil Sebastian, etc. , daily specials, nice equipment, great touch hell, even their drip coffee is amazing because they only make it small batch. These people know what they're doing, but, equally importantly, they've created a caf u00e9 space that's a pleasure to go to.",2
"Wow, just got my car back after having an alignment done, and could not believe how courteous Gerry the store manager was. Also very professional. With the warranty I got, I can go back any time within a year to have the alignment done any time or as many times as I want. Great prices too. This will have to be my new go to spot from now on.",2
"Well, another successful trip to this great stop. It's important to get there early so you get the best selection. Shoes are hit and miss, but the jewelry and clothing are a good find. I got a 150 Elie Tahari skirt brand new for only 7. And a bunch of Norstrom Shimera robes for 9. Definitely worth a stop but need to be flexible to hunt around a bit. Overall, a great find.",2
"Umm. here we go. It was a nice restaurant to sit down with the family and enjoy a good meal. The food was great, everything went well. but our waiter didn't seem too happy about taking our orders or even working. He looked so annoyed and was rushing our orders. When we asked for condiment, he looked all stressed out. By the way, HE WAS THE ONLY ONE ON THE FLOOR.",1
"Had a great time here. if only I could recall more of the night. I understand the cover is high. although we didn't pay I would have paid to get in. The playboy bunny's are adorable and happy to take photos with those who ask. The gents working door and what not were super sweet. I didn't gamble at all but, but, when I go again I will plan to drink less so I can.",2
"Save your money, this place has bad food that has been left out for hours. Food poisoning, to add, the food is cold and they take it back and warm it in a microwave. I never thought any Chinese restaurant could screw up fried rice. Service is bad. They are so rude. Overall the food is yuk and service is even worse.",1
Horrible horrible horrible ! Customer service sucks! They don't care at all about their customers! I pay over 200 a month for cable and Internet but they want to make you wait days to come fix a problem when it's their issue that caused your problem absolutely ridiculous! And watch your bills if you do have them they will charge you for things you do not have !,1
"I order delivery from this location all the time. The sandwiches are great, standard Jimmy Johns goodness that we all love, but the delivery almost always takes 15 20 minutes. That wouldn't be a big deal, except I live less than a mile away. I don't know why every time it takes so long, but the food is good and the employees are friendly.",2
"This place is hot! Came here on a Sunday night w my girlfriends and we got in with no hassle. Very impressed with the clubs decor. In order to party here you definitely need ""BANK "" because drinks are really pricey. The music was awesome.they played mostly hip hop and house. Very good looking people everywhere.no drama! Waitresses were giving away free shots. Will definitely come back again!",2
"This college dive pizza pasta place is great for what it is. Not much on decor or ambiance but thumbs up for a quick, cheap meal. 9 got me an iceburg salad choice of dressing , spaghetti with meat sauce and a slice of garlic bread. Will definitely hit the spot on a quick craving but should definitely be avoided on a ""date night "". PS stick with the house Chianti . only palatable wine in the place.",1
"I know that I'm supposed to like this place, as it's loved on the east side, but it really doesn't excite me too much. It's never too clean, and I don't ever feel that I'm getting a great shopping experience for the extra premium in price. They've got good stuff, but so does Brennans, Whole Foods, and Jennifer Street Market. Maybe I'm just not cool enough to shop there?",1
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! nWe walked here everyday we were in Vegas to get our drinks! n Eye candy pina colada was the best combo! nThe bartenders can you call them that in a mall? haha were hilarious super friendly! nThere isn't much else I can say besides adding a shot is only 1! n they offer discounts if you bring back your cup!,2
"Tried their new store at 3140 S. Gilbert Road.very hard to find no frontage, no signage, no street visibility but well worth it! Excellent carne asada. My wife loves their signature ""FRY BREAD "" which is a meal and a half. Love their use of green chili in a number of dishes. We've been back twice since discovering the place last month and plan to be regulars at this new location.",2
One star for the wait staff. Ate lunch there on a Thursday had a blt sandwich and cream of broccoli soup. The soup tasted funny so they replaced with chicken soup which tasted a lot like Campbell's soup. The coffee wasn't the best either. That night I felt sick and I spent the whole weekend throwing up and unable to eat anything else. Won't be going back.,1
Second time I have gone through Drive Thru and ordered Chicken Nuggets for my nephew. They always forget the sauce. Called to let them know it has happened twice. The girl on the other end of the line said to check before I leave that it's in there. I am paying for a product and checking to see that someone else has done their job. Sad.,1
I really like this location it is a bit small. There are no crowds that I have ever ran into. It is convenient for me off the 303 freeway and Glendale. I can just drive and drop off mail. If I have to go inside there are friendly faces there to help me. I wish I added this location a long time ago. I would have had more check ins.,2
"My husband and I came here for lunch and had a very nice experience. The chips and salsa were delicious. I ordered the blackened shrimp lettuce wrap and it was a nice light but filling flavorful lunch. My husband got the enchiladas and also really enjoyed them. Our waiter, JR had a very fun personality and provided great service! Nice atmosphere and reasonable prices. We will be coming back!",2
"Not exactly a NY slice. Pizza tastes great, all herbs and spices are there, its a solid slice, especially in the area where good pizza is hard to come by. Im from the tri state so I would like to think my opinion is a valued one. Only clear dislike is the crust on the bottom of the pie is quite soft.",2
Last August we came to Phoenix and looked at a ton of parks to spend the winter at. We were fortunate to get a spot at this park. The slips are awesome with enough room in between them. Nice area to take the dogs for a walk and the facilities are nice and always clean. We spend about every afternoon at the hot tub and pool and we've met a lot of other great rvr's here.,2
"These people are Horrible to get ahold of, I had an issue with a firewall they sold me, which I had right during audit time and they took forever to get back to me. They sent a technician out he worked on it said he had it running but then it wasn't working the next day. Do not do business with these people!",1
I love this place.I use to come all the time but now I work too much and don't get a chance to stop in but man is this place amazing.the rosemary potatoes are killer omelet selections are to die for and the specials are amazing.and did I mention that HUGE pancake thing they make well worth the wait and share it! ,2
"Was decent. Girls were not very energetic but looked great. nAt some point my wallet fell i out of my pocket and the management returned it to me cashless. I kind of expected it, but they didnt offer any kind of retribution for being robbed. Like it should happen, or.they were fully aware of it. Pretty shady",1
"Decent extended stay hotel but no silverware or cookware which should be provided. Cockroach was in the sink which freaked us out. Not the greatest ventilation and really warm inside. Took a while for the room to cool down. Otherwise, spacious and liveable. Just remember to bring your pots, pans, etc if you are living for a while here and want to use the stove and oven.",1
"This is a very clean and professional hotel. The location is perfect for layover at the airport. Shuttle service is fast and efficient. Front lobby is awesome the rooms are once again very clean most have balconies. I did not eat at any of the restaurants, but the guest I spoke with said the food was excellent. JF",2
"Came after 4 a.m. Place was full, service is standard issue, not great, not bad. Egg rolls and spring rolls are average. Ordered Large Pho with everything. Came out pretty quick, the bowl is not large enough for my standard. They skimped on the meats and organs.not happy. Broth is decent. Overall.average.",1
 Horrible Banh Mi nThe only reason this gets 2 stars is bc it could pass as a strip club late night with the neon lights. Definitely the nicest looking Lee's but the food doesnt even come close to matching up. The bread needs to be baked a little more and the meat are really bad quality. I got the grilled pork and it was the worst ive ever had.,1
"Love! nThis place was suggested to me by the concierge. The restaurant is adorable inside outside terrace and the bar nextdoor is TONS of fun. Saw some live French Canadian music, people there were great. Beer was cheap, waiters attentive. Had a blast. A very strong ""GO! "" to anyone passing through town!",2
"Is this place even open? Same problem they had when they were chill n yogurt. Their yelp and grub hub both say they're open until 10, but when I show up at 8 15 they are closed. It's the only yogurt shop close to my house and I've never been so frustrated by a local business in my life. Get your shit together.",1
"Mannish lady came up to us, gave us wristbands and ushered us into the Azure pool. I'm so glad I was one of the few who went upstairs to decorate our friend's bachelorette suite while we left some of the girls to hang by the pool. The waitresses are not sexy or even cute, and the patrons are even more blinding. Whew, I'm enthralled I had to do bridesmaid duty that afternoon!",1
"Cute restaurant, very clean and food was delicious. Service came with a smile which in my book equals excellent. From what I remember, our party of four had lamb, rosemary potatoes, Greek fries, gyro pitas, and a halloumi mushroom platter. I'm looking forward to trying something different next time.",2
"This is a newer theater, you can reserve your seats and everything is clean and new looking. I love being able to reserve your seats because you can buy your tickets, go to dinner and arrive only a few minutes before the movie starts and not have to worry about finding a good seat or arriving early to sit where you want. They also offer a military discount, I paid 7.50 adult at night on a weekend.",2
"Been here a few times now, and have never really had any complaints. The food always tastes fresh and flavorful, and I've never left feeling overly stuffed like on the verge of passing out! which is a very good thing! I've particularly liked the fish entrees salmon and rainbow trout . And the desserts are great the perfect size to polish off a tasty meal. We'll be back!",2
"A very interesting concept would be fun with a group. Fill out a questionnaire and wait to see what shows up. The food that does arrive is creative and well plated. The wine list could be more robust, but the selections are well chosen. The wine pairings are competent. The service is helpful and not intrusive. Hard to find, so come with a navigator. Postmodern dining.",2
The food at this place rocks! and it is consistent. We've been going there regularly for a few years now and never had a bad meal. Service is usually very fast and efficient albeit not so friendly. Place can be loud when busy so don't expect to have a meaningful conversation but the food is a great value for the price. It's also one of the few places in this area that serves food after 11 PM.,2
"Everything is awesome at this place, and authentic according to my Japanese friend. I just love the fact that they have more than just sushi. Their fish with rice dish was amazing. Since I've come to AZ, I've never seen this dish at any Japanese restaurants around here. The staff is all Japanese, with somewhat limited English, so I guess you know you're at an authentic place.",2
"My group of 4 recently hit up Stax's while on vacation. We started with drinks and apps which were 1 2 price due to happy hour. Next we moved to burgers and salads. Burgers included lamb, buffalo and kangaroo their exotic meat for the day . Salads were large and fresh. If the weather permits make sure you sit outside so you can enjoy the rare expensive cars of Scottsdale.",2
"I was very lucky today as I walked in their lunch special was ""MOLE "" oh my! I love this stuff. it was 5.99 w the delicious side of beans and rice, perfect serving size w a warm toritlla. I loved it I've been in and out of this place for the last 6 years. pretty descent. they are def more traditional than americanized.",2
Ordered the special 2 med for 6.99 each. 1 was supposed to be half olive and half cheese. They put olives on all of it. Asked them to just do the 2nd pizza. Charged me 12 for 1 medium pizza. No thank you. I'll take my business to someone who can make what I order. The entire time they were looking at each other confused. Rude people.,1
"This place does not disappoint! My husband and I shared the Gold Standard and Steakhouse burgers and the both of us were very impressed at how layered the flavors are, especially the Gold Standard! I also had a vegan milkshake I think it's the only one on the menu and it was AWESOME! I cannot wait to get back to Vegas to have another.",2
"This was delicious and very worth the money. Lots of food and we came at the right time too! I think we got there around 11 or 12ish and we got to eat breakfast and lunch as they switched to lunch around 12 or 1ish. My timing is probably off, but whatever, we got there at a great time is my point It was only the second buffet we ate at and it had a line so it meant it was good.",2
"There are a lot of families here to skate tonight, yet no one is here. Website says one time, sign on office says another. Oh, did I mention the flier in the lobby says another? No times on their voicemail either. Disappointing. This is our second time here today. No one mentioned there was no public skating tonight. They said they WOULD be open.",1
Don't let the size of this place fool you. It's filled with big flavor. This was my first visit and I was pleasantly surprised. The dough was fried perfectly. The bean and red chile were delicious but a sample of my friend's green chile set my order for my next visit. The staff was friendly and helpful.,2
"Came here for the first time and was recommended by a Buddy of mine. ""Chapo "" is the one I dealt with on the phone and gave me directions. He gave me a quote over the phone and stuck to it. They got me in right away and got it done quick. Highly recommended if you need exhaust work. Will definitely be coming back.",2
"Friday night and a good crowd in the dining room, the bar and the outside patio with fireplace. Impressed by the menu with everything from pizza to burgers to entrees. The firecracker shrimp appetizer was great and well presented. We each got burgers which come in beef, turkey, and veggie options. Great fries as well. A varied wine menu had a lot of options.",2
"Food was mediocre. Beer was delish. Service was bad. Super long wait for the food. We had to share a table with some weird people. I do like my space. Free entertainment was amusing. This place was worth the experience, but I'll never come back. If it's your birthday, they might have you do some pretty ridiculous things with a looong horn. Just a warning.",1
"I wrote a review about the other store location but this is the one I frequent the most. I love it and with the amount of labor that goes into this i'm glad that the prices are what they are. The long hours in a cleaners with all the steam is not fun, I know this since my family owned a cleaners as I was growing up. Never a bad experience and always fast service!",2
"AWFUL. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. The chicken was too sweet, and while it looks like a big sandwich with a lot, it's a whole lot of NOTHING. No flavour, stale, tasteless. and the old guy serving was also pretty rude. Why be rude? No one will come back to visit. I'd rather go across the street to a REAL Vietnamese Banh Mi shop.",1
"This place is heavily mentioned in all of the Phoenix travel books, so you'd expect it to be pretty busy and ful of tourists. Well, affirmative on both ends. I wasn't impressed with the service at all, but the food was really good. Breakfast sandwich and cappucinos tasty with lots of fillings. It's also nice to wander around their store and look at the crafty art stuff.",2
"Three weeks later, we finally received an email letting us know the photos have been edited. They're straight now, but still the quality is far below the quality of the true professional who did all the photos before the wedding, wedding party and reception photos. If you are required to use their services, plan to save money and hire a second photographer for the rest of your wedding!",1
This looked like the best food option in terminal 4. I'm glad I chose it. I am a vegetarian and the cashier girl was very friendly and helpful and gave me great options not listed on the menu. The food was cooked to order you can see them so you know it's fresh . It tastes great and the food was brought out to me at the table. Great service and great food and at a great affordable price.,2
"Awful pedicure and manicure! Never ever will I go back. It might have just been the lady I had, but my god it looks terrible. Crooked nails, polish not even covering my whole nail, and didn't do a good job removing cuticles or callouses. When I asked her to fix my crooked nail she argued with me! I would not recommend this place.",1
"Great place, great food and great ambiance. One of the best patios in town for summer. This place is right across from Outremont theater where all the top French troupes from Paris come to perform. Naturally they come to chill at this restaurant after the show. So if you want to socialize with some really bohemian French artists this is your spot.",2
"I like the idea of a local grocer, but the prices are somewhat higher than the chain stores. I ventured into this location because the distributor for a rare item said this Bashas' carried it. No such luck. I was in the store long enough to appreciate how clean it is and some novelty items such as banana iced cookies, what!? I may have to pick some of those up.",2
"This place was pretty good. I had ordered the sliders, with a side of 12 year old whiskey macallan , the spicy tuna w fried rice, and a bowl of ramen. The ramen was tasty, the broth was thick and delicious, full of flavor. The price you pay for is for the decor, the lounge, and let's face it. You are in a mall eating retail food P Sit down, relax, enjoy your drink, and get some great snacks.",2
"Ick wanted to like this place, service was okay, the Honduras was good, not great, but the mocha frappe I think it's called that?! was TERRIBLE! Watered down chocolate shake, NOT worth 5.50.McDonald's frappe is better! And I'm being nice nMaybe I'm spoiled with independent coffee houses back home, but this place blew! Back to L.A. County and yummy coffee!",1
"I have been here twice recently and enjoyed both times. I had the avocado eggs Benedict and it is cooked very nicely. the service is good. I would definitely recommend breakfast from here. On a side note, the water glasses are huge which I love so even when they are busy you never run out of water. Nice little spot!",2
"The hot and sour soup was ok. Everything else was basically inedible. Water was not noticeably hose y as per other reviews. More than 1 4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be ""krab "", considering the price of the buffet. No pot stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won ton soup.",1
The trip was amazing. We took the tour that landed in the canyon. Very professional outfit. The video was kind of stupid but I understand they probably have to do that for liability purposes. Sandwich wasn't good but who wants to eat when you only have 30 mins to check out the scenery? Ask if they are running specials.,2
"I love hosting large groups here! They are so accommodating, will do separate checks and provide excellent customer service. I've had at least 5 events with parties of 20 people sometimes even last minute and they don't bat an eye. The food is pretty good and they have a very large bar selection. The tortillas are fresh and my favorite dish is the shrimp fajitas.",2
"This place is awesome! Six of us sat at the bar and chatted with the owner and bartenders.what a great group of guys. Couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. EVO is the real deal amazing food, creative cocktails, hospitable service, all in a chic and trendy atmosphere. You will not be disappointed! LOVE, LOVE this place!",2
"Taking this time at 7 in the morning to say that I'm very disappointed with their customer service. Their cashier, Donna, needs a little more orientation time to say the least. It's 7 am on a Monday morning. I get it. Put a smile on your face and fake it till you make, you know what I'm saying?! Maybe a desk job hidden away from people would better suit her. Happy Monday!",1
I've always had good service here and was so thrilled when they opened since it meant I no longer had to drive to Maryland Parkway for some good ube macapuno cake. The quality is usually consistently good with the rare hiccup. I love that they have individual cake slices in a variety of flavors when I just want a little bit or I'm craving a selection.,2
This company is extremely professional. I called around 10am as I had been dog sitting.he was able to get to my house by 2pm. He gave me an honest quote. He went out of his way to treat every spot. Extremely nice and did an amazing job. I would highly recommend him to anyone and will definitely be calling him as soon as I need my carpet or tile cleaned again.,2
It is only lacking the 5th star for the prices. They are a little too high for the amount of food but the quality and service are the best you can find anywhere for breakfast food. n nI went on a friday morning around 10 30 and still had a wait. I am told to expect a wait no matter what. Its a very good idea to check this place out if you are around town.,2
"When visiting Scottsdale from snowy Chicago, I had iced coffee on the mind. Not just any regular iced coffee, but deep, dark, delicious cold brew. A quick search on Yelp and I found Cartel downtown. The menu is simple, and there are two sizes of cold brew. I ordered up a large for 3, and it was exactly what I was craving. It was so good, I made a return trip the next day to repeat it.",2
"All I can say is ""Wow ""! Finally I have found a professional, sanitary and courteous nail salon. I've been going to Helen for about 2 months now and I couldn't be happier. She works quickly but doesn't rush, does exactly what I ask and the prices are great. nI leave feeling like I've been pampered, so it's my treat to myself every 2 weeks.",2
Yes this IS as good as it gets. I have shopped several Sprouts but was thrilled to see this Sprouts going up in my area. Their produce is always the best and the best prices. Another thing I love are the bulk items and their meat department. It's hard to find grain fed and organic meat for a reasonable price. Thx!,2
"this is my favorite Starbucks on campus. Needless to say how good Starbucks coffees are, the atmosphere in this Starbucks is very soothing, I like reading, telecommuting or even studying for exam at upstairs, where big couches are provided. I spent most of my class intervals here as it is really strategic to be on the state street. I even bought an Ipad from a college student here. LOL.",2
"Went here for dinner, Burgers were tasty but expensive since fries aren't included and basic toppings cost extra e.g. onions or pickles . Don't get the wings appetizer i think it was 9 for like 5 mediocre wings which was a rip off. Also, they don't have any beers on tap so be prepared for 4 for a bottle or can. Overall pretty so so experience but free peanuts were good!",1
"Jon is friendly, professional, and efficient. I met with him for head shots to use on my various social media profiles before the start of law school. Found him on Yelp with a good deal, and couldn't be happier with the results. My public image is MUCH more professional and surely a worthwhile investment for years to come. Thanks Jon for your excellent service!",2
"I had the Classic Burger with a few modifications. The burger looked pretty good but it tasted quite salty maybe due to the amount of grease? . The sweet potato fries were ok, but weren't as crispy as others I've had before. Overall the place is clean and the food is served rather quickly. nI might give them another try to see if the salty burger was a fluke.",1
"WOW, their chocolate cupcake is sinful. Very rich icing which I believe as ganache or at least had that consistency. Very delicious. I also had their pineapple coconut cookie which was very good as well. There's a couple of bar seats in the store and a couple of tables in front of the store and that's about it. Definitely more of a take it and go establishment.",2
"I'm normally not the chain restaurant type, but plans changed and here I am. nService was typical nothing extraordinary but nothing too great either. nFood was bland, chicken was dry, and I don't think I got half my plate down. Should have known better than to order pasta at a place that specializes in ""ribs, seafood, and chops "" nSomeone please shoot me if I ever find myself at this place again.",1
" RENAMED! Royal Taj here hasn't moved, but was forced to rename over a Liquor License issue. The same owner remains, the new name is Nandini Indian Cuisine, and he has lowered the Weekday Lunch Buffet price, earning them a boost to 5 Stars! See my new Review for this excellent restaurant at the Nandini Yelp page. This restaurant is unrelated to Royal Taj in Chandler. ",2
"The staff was very nice. No complaints there. nThe bagels however, not fresh. When I see the bagels covered in plastic I know they were not made that day. It was dry and had no taste at all. It was about 10 30 am, so they should have been fresh. nI have to say the place seemed very dirty to me. The floors and tables look like they do not get washed to often.",1
"Jimmy's is a good ""hidden "" place to eat. It isn't exactly hiding, there just isn't much near by except the community college, a few car dealerships and a Little Caesars. The restaurant is very nice, the food is good, the wait staff is personable and rumor has it their Happy Hour is good. Nothing too out of the ordinary, but a good place to try if in the area. I'll be back.",2
"This place is absolutely horrible, ordered online got there then waited nearly 30 minutes just to get the food, people there didn't even have forks to eat there food, employees we're yelling at customers to sit down and wait while they bring them there. Rude customer service. Never coming back here again which is weird just about 6 months ago they had there stuff together now they are horrible.",1
"Just off Desert Inn Rd Arville this is a real shit nest bar with a couple ofpool tables, a dart game, golden tee golf and a 20 25 person bar with video poker machines. The drinks are cheap, they no longer have food but they have a kitchen. They've done a little remodeling lately but this place is frequented by low lifes.",1
"I really do love Red Koi, but since the prices went up.maybe six months ago we don't go there as often. they redecorated and the menu changed a bit, but the food is consistently amazing! Service is iffy, depends on who you get. I wish we could do it every weekend like we used to, but it's more of a special treat now.",2
"This was our second time at Herb'n Flavors. My husband ordered the special 1 2 pound hamburger. He ordered it medium rare and it came well done. The side dish of beet salad had rancid capers in it yuch! When we told the waitress about these problems, she just said she was sorry and did nothing to rectify the situation. There are too many other good restaurants in town We will never return.",1
"The only daquiri place worth going to in Vegas. Prices appear to be expensive, but this isn't the watered down booze found in other daquiris. This is the real deal, and the sizes are huge. Extra shots and jello shots are 1 a pop. Get a designated driver or plan for a cab, and try out the Orange Octane 190, or as I call it, Orange Flavored Booze Slushy.",2
"Atmosphere is nice, only complaint is music is pretty loud for some reason. Gyoza was delicious! Came out quickly. The ramen on the other hand took a while, so I recommend you have patience if you come. Not sure why its taking so long. How was it? Yummy. I had the chicken and pork broth. Toilet seat experience. don't be scared P just push the buttons.",2
"Every time I stop here, I am accosted by beggars as I pump gas or put air in my tires. I have complained twice to the clerks they seem disinterested. I note the criminals take the dollars they cadge into the store and buy things. Perhaps that is why management doesn't provide security or call 911. I will never stop there again.",1
"I had the soondubu jjigae on a rainy afternoon just awhile ago. Saltiest broth I've EVER had at a Korean restaurant. I couldn't even drink the soup. All the seafood in my bowl was incredibly rubbery and difficult to swallow. The added sodium did not help. On top of all this, the soup had no weight and was really thin. I was basically drinking salt water. Hoping for a better experience next time.",1
"My wife and I get tired of the same old spots to grab lunch or a quick dinner. After awhile all of the Mexican restaurants start to look and taste the same and don't even get me started on places like BJ's, Yard House, etc. How refreshing to find Coconut's. The fish tacos and the fish and chips are fantastic. You'll also enjoy the friendly staff and the casual interior.",2
"Once again, my gf and I had a tremendous time here during lunch today. The aged angus truffle burger with truffle fries was amazing. Medium rare, truffle oil, etc.soooo bomb! They weren't stingy with the fries either. The assorted breads were hot and new too. The service was an A! Basically every little piece of review on this place is 100 ! Its a must go to place here no matter what.",2
"Went there for the first time today and didn't taste anything that would get me to come back. Nice people work there. Chips and salsa were below average. The ice tea was fine. I had several of the street tacos of which only the Pulled Pork would I order again . though, I doubt I'll return. Rock Taco is a good idea kinda reminds me of a Mexican Hard Rock Cafe however, it needs a better menu.",1
"I was an accident prone kid and spent a lot of time in Children's ER for various broken bones and concussions. haha! I haven't seen the new hospital but I've heard it is gorgeous! The old hospital wasn't bad either. The care I received there was fantastic, the nurses, techs, clerks, and docs were excellent. ",2
"Love this place as a special weekend morning treat. My 6 year old would go there every weekend and the owner is always super nice to us. Always pick something up when guests are in town. The sticky buns, cinn rolls are a must. The salty sweet combo is perfect. Loaf of white bread is great too! Go try it. You'll be glad you did!",2
There was a party going on the night that we came and all of the service was focused on them. It took about 30 minutes to get our drinks and another 20 to get our food.45 minutes and the restaurant wasn't that busy! They also don't know how to use their open table reservations! One person was working for the first 20 minutes we were here. Not impressed!,1
Just ordered a chicken manchurian from here. Sorry to say but there was NO FLAVOR what so ever! Stir frying Huge chunks of chicken in tomato sauce does not cut it! Not to mention the portion size for the money you charge. I absolutely love food and am more than willing to pay for the food and experience but this kind of food is not appreciable. Extremely disappointed!,1
"I was really excited to visit Juicebox for the first time, but wasn't really impressed. nThe price vs portion size is sad and the taste was pretty average. nI got half of a sandwich with chips bean dip as a side and it didn't come close to filling me up even tho it's was around 6. I posted a picture if you'd like to see. nI blame Shadyside for this imbalance.",1
"Want to try a new place to have a decent burrito. After watching them make the burrito, I headed for Roberto's. Disappointed with the pre cooked meat just sitting on the counter drying out. Made to order just taste so much better, but I will go back and try the taco's. The meat cooking on that vertical grill looks good but the burrito's need to change NOW.",1
"Found my new burger spot in Chandler. Bison burger, sweet potato fries, and fried green beans were superb. Nothing like a good bison burger, good micro brews, and good music in the background. Can't wait to hit it for happy hour. If you like a quality burger and chill atmosphere, I recommend you check it out.",2
"We love this restaurant. For the past 11 years we have gone there or picked up dinner almost every Friday. It is great to invite friends for dinner and pick up the dinner at the Sushi Box. The food always looks beautiful and is well liked for those who do not like raw fish, there are lovely cooked things . Mr and Mrs Kim are always incredibly accommodating to our varied needs.",2
"They have pistachio flavored gelato! And wow was it awesome! I had that and two scoops of coffee gelato, which was recommended by one one of the girls who works there. nThey're all so nice their. I like how the owner makes the gelato fresh everyday! I was also told that new flavors were yet to be introduced. Great place with exceptional service!",2
This was our first time. we had appitzer of hummus and vegtables followed by sliders for the guys and burgers for the gals. the cucumber martini amazing. would come again. next time want to try the Veg out burger. this comes highly recommended by a friend. nOur waiter and hostess very friendly and fun.,2
I would recommend these guys and will keep their number. Kelly was great! He did excellent work. I did check out Home Depot pricing and never did get a quote or call back or a price for the installation. nI asked Kelly if he owned the company he said he had been with them 20 years. Great service thank you Kelly.,2
"I'm not sure I would recommend this place to anyone. The staff was extremely rude, the rooms were sub par our floor was lifting from what looked like a lot of water damage the beds weren't that comfortable, the pillows were terrible, and it is super noisy from the surrounding clubs and loud patrons. I think there are much better options at a much more affordable rate.",1
"Are you kidding me, from the grease soaked walls to the greasy inedible food, to the roaches that crawled across our table.THUMBS DOWN! nAfter about 20 minutes into our meal and roach crawled across our table not to mention the few we saw on the walls. This place was so dirty, I needed a shower when we got home. DISGUSTING, DEPLORABLE, GREASY FOOD!",1
"Pizza is like sex. Even bad pizza isn't half bad. Well my first girlfriend and this place have proven that old age adage NOT to be true. Zero, and I mean ZERO flavor in this pizza. I'm all about the sauce and this sauce has the distinct flavor of water. And where in the heck do you find flavorless Pepperoni? Where ever you do, that's where these guys shop! Yikes!",1
"dude. pricey. but well worth it. nin the heart of the financial district. which i've never ever seen before. nthe service was the business. like 4 ppl wait on you. nmy rib eye steak was a a little burned on the outside. but still tender and non chewy. it was perfect! the sides. the shit. nyams and sweet potato mashed potatoes. nyeah. if u got the ends, definitely try it!",2
Food is good. Not great. They do not follow their posted business hours so don't be surprised to find the establishment closed at 830 on a Saturday when the door says 930. Also the staff is very rude. Especially the miserable lady that takes orders. She acts as if she's doing me a favor when actually I could have chose any other pizza place in Pittsburgh. And I will!,1
"Food is 5 stars, but the automatic wait for a table is not for the weak. The staff will have your back to cover thr HUGE menu. Start your meal with some toasted ravioli and golden BBQ wings. Order your deep dish at the same time and it will be ready by time you are done with the apps. Make sure to order a Bellini and a pizza cookie too!",2
"Cute little family owned restaurant thats been around for a while. Extremely tasty, low price Indian food. You get the daily special for about 5 bucks which comes with naan. Grab a samosa too for sure. The food sometimes tastes a little greasy which I'm not always down with but its still great food.",2
The world's slowest service do not go here if you are in a hurry. The food was a miss for me but I don't blame the restaurant I had the Pollo Cubano and the flavor was really bright not really my thing but maybe I just don't like Cuban flavors. I did enjoy the rice and beans on the side. The server was courteous but so sloooooooow I don't see a reason to go back.,1
"Tried it twice, not a fan. Wanted to like it? I know Olive Garden is down the street and can produce a quailty product. If I compared the two I have to go with Olive Garden, quality salad, bread, service. Stiff competition around here, if the service was there and the food quality was better it could maybe be as good as the Olive Garden.",1
Came here while on vacation and sat outside on the patio. Didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised by the amazing taste of our food! I got the gyro and fries and it was huge. Loved the feta on the gyro! Everything tasted fresh and the price was decent too. Would definitely come agaiext time I'm in Vegas.,2
"I have been a few times with my Turkish roommate. We love it! Food is heavenly. And to COUNTERACT the review below about waitress Desiree, she is sweet, attentive, social knowledgable about the food. She Oscar other waiter are half the reason we like this place so much. We are still talking about how great they are 30min after we have left. Promise you, you'll walk away fat happy!",2
I wanted to try Pho for the longest time but never did. I finally got up the nerve and can't believe I waited this long. Pho Saigon 8 is awesome. Incredible prices and even better tasting food. The hubby even said it's the best he's had in Vegas so far. Most likely gonna make this place a weekly tradition.,2
"It's a buffet, so preparing for masses can only leave so much care. The truth is if you are coming here for anything other than quantity you will probably be disappointed. They have most of the main stations, American, seafood, Mexican, Italian, seafood and desserts. The service is great, but the best feature is the view. You can see all of the river and even sit out side on a nice day.",1
"I purchased a deal through Groupon for a full highlight, haircut and deep conditioning treatment. Faith did a great job on my highlights! I am really happy with the way they turned out. The Beauty Venue is in a great location, great pricing and Faith has flexible hours. I'll definitely be going back for another highlight.",2
"Best place in Henderson and you can't beat the value. It's not a spa, so don't expect perfect solidtude, but you get a great 1 hour massage for 29 that touches every major part and 42 for 100 minutes is just awseome. Cici is respsonsive as the manager and my wife thought her massage was perfect and Tina is fantastic.",2
"I stopped after work to place a to go order. I ordered fried rice, California rolls, and noodles that were recommended. I appreciated the plentiful serving sizes and friendly service as I waited. The food was okay. I hoped for more, but did not enjoy my meal. The California rolls were dry and lacked flavor. Maybe it was a bad day for them.",1
"We were between a 3 and 4 on this place. The food, service and ambiance were all nice. better than a 3 but not quite a 4. We decided to go higher because there was a make your own bloody mary bar which added to the fun of the restaurant. There was also a long line when we got there are were seated quickly without a reservation. I'd come back.",2
"This is the much classier and tastier version of your Baja Fresh and Chipotle. It seems that they really take interest in providing the fresh ingredients. I haven't had this dish myself, but I heard the sweet pork is amazing. I had a taco salad, and it was extremely flavorful. I think the ambiance and where this Costa Vida is located gives it a clear sell that this means business!",2
"Large windows allow Mac owners to be observed in their natural habitat. The chick running the counter had experienced better mornings in her life, but the refreshing early morning smokers growl that escaped from her lips as she asked what type of muffin I would like captivated me. The coffee is delicious though. I would definitely purchase it again.at a different coffee shop.",1
"i had a great time here waitresses service was good no complaints! i had a burger which tasted straight from a grill n homemade, wasnt a fan of the stringy fries tho, loud music that might bust ur ears if u heard it long enuf,. thr are lots of tvs to enjoy any game on all in all i wud come here another time. too bad i didnt see thunder dan",2
"I like Zoyo, but I'm not sure I would come here if it weren't for the little girl I babysit who loves their yogurt. Sometimes I just feel like their flavors are too processed, and all of their yogurts regardless of dairy content or flavor have high fructose corn syrup in them. nIf you do go here, try the cake batter or the oatmeal cookie flavors, with toasted coconut.",1
"This place in my opinion is nothing special. My wife and I live right around the corner from here, so we though we would give it a try and really hoped we would like it. We got chicken curry and chicken pad Thai. Both were pretty bland. Neither my wife and I were too pumped about our food. I probably won't come back here.",1
Why does YELP put the negative comments before the good ones? We have always had a great time at Rambo's with great food! I wrote my review way before the one on 3 31 11 and that one is on top. Even though the POSITIVE comments and reviews regarding Rambo's outweigh the negative ones. Play fair YELP!,2
This place is a must see. Not a run of the mill pawn shop while your at it go on Friday night for the food truck and music events. Not your normal food trucks either. So grab some food and be prepared to travel back in time thought the southwest history at some some of the most amazing items you will find anywhere. You won't be sorry!,2
"the setting inside the restaurant was really nice. we didnt sit outside since it was very hot. the food was good, but didnt stand out from any of the other vegas restaurants ive tried. i ordered the ribeye which tasted like a ribeye i could make at home. the sides were decent as well. the only thing that surprised me was their cheese bread.awesome! but overall service and food were just okay",2
I'd like to give them no stars but I didn't have that option. I ordered food for delivery once and they took an hour and a half. They got lost and didn't bother calling me for directions even though I gave them my number specifically for that reason. My food was cold and I didn't get my entire order. They suck! Don't eat there.,1
Mimis Cafe has the best chicken cordon bleu in Arizona. The chicken breast is breaded with panko and is crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside. The ham is grilled the swiss cheese and the sauce makes all the flavors so yummy. I eat this dish with their baby potatoes and broccoli. You will always leave happy after eating this dish.,2
"This item is a must have for your walking tour of Vegas. Fire and water fountain effects that look like real hot lava! Runs every hour starting at 5 00pm and ending at 11 00pm each night. The railing fills up pretty quick, but this show is just as good from across the street you can even feel the heat from the flames all the way across the street.",2
Got tickets for this from Goldstar. It was funny and kinda cool. Glad I got discount tickets or maybe I might have been disappointed. All in all it was a good experience. They are talented and the show is entertaining. Its not at all like a Cirque du Soleil show or anything. Its just ok. Make sure you get your discounted tickets for this event or its not worth it.,2
"This place was overpriced and not that good. The bread tasted old and stale, the meat was alright, there are just a lot better options if you want to spend 13 on a meal. The only reason I have two stars instead of one is because the workers were really nice and helpful, it's not their fault the sandwiches they're serving are not quality.",1
"Not really impressed with the food quality. They had the standard fare of thin crab legs, prime rib and assorted foods, but the quality wasn't there for me. Perhaps I am on the road too much and have become too much of a food critic. Next time I will use Yelp before I make my selection instead of when I do the review.",1
Great service and even better food. I had a ribeye that was one of the best I've ever had. My wife had the asparagus crab salad that she thought was good but nothing to write home about. The ambiance was five star it's in the Encore and the calamari appetizer was the best both of us had ever had. Mindblowingly good! I'd give it five stars if my wife's dish was killer. I would go back in a minute.,2
"It's rare that you find good food in an airport and it's nearly impossible to find good coffee. Well I found the pink unicorns of coffee shops Cartel Coffee Lab. Hands down, one of the best cappuccinos I've had period. A super knowledgeable staff, fair prices and prompt service made this an excellent experience. Highly recommended!",2
So apparently this is their Carmel moolatte to me it's more pure sugar than anything else no coffee or caramel flavoring. As for their service it sucked the guy couldn't remember what donut I ordered and it wasn't like there was a lot of people there! Ok it's official I won't be back I'll go to paradise across the parking lot.,1
Do not do business with these guys. They hire people to put out fliers and don't care about no trespass solicitation signs. I've called the mgr twice with no luck. I pull EVERY flier out of the door and toss them. I've called 311 to try to catch them and trespass them. Last Sat 3 15 14 I was threatened with physical harm by one of the flier guys.,1
"One of my favorite spots on Freemont St,love sitting outside while sipping a grapefruit beer.Grapefruit beer so light and refreshing I want one now. Food is excellent try the ahi tuna salad, seared ahi tuna with mixed greens and a vinegrette dressing. Chicken and waffle sandwich is insane you need a big appetite. Can't wait for my next visit to The Park.",2
"I had a one bedroom suite and I was surprised to find a jacuzzi hot tub in my bed room! It also had a wash dryer in the bathroom. I could have lived there. The room had a projector screen TV, full kitchen and a pull out couch. Pretty sweet! The only draw back is the maze that connects you to Planet hollywood and the miracle mile. Not fun when you're just trying to find your room and get to bed.",2
"I love this place. It's a little bit of the Bronx right here in dusty Phoenix. The thing I crave of theirs is the stromboli, which is filled to bursting with fresh ingredients. It's often my choice for my cheats on my diet. Gotta love when New Yorkers come in and show the rest of the town how it's done.",2
"Adorable baby boutique! I went to the grand opening today and everything at Cheeky Chic is so precious. They have unique products, such as indestructible books, super cute baby clothes and accessories and amazing gifts to give to those expecting or with a new baby. I highly recommend checking them out! They had great prices and I will for sure be back!",2
"This is the best pizza place I've found in Phoenix so far. Truly one of the must trys. I think they have a grandfathered brick oven? Not sure if its a rumor or not. but something makes their pizza delightful. Very good New York style pizza! I haven't been able to try anything else but judging from these reviews I really should. Oh, and did I mention? Its like 3 bucks a slice!",2
"A 65 Denny breakfast for 4 adults. Nothing impressive or noteworthy. Went here because we had a 35 credit. If we weren't exhausted we would have walked to breakfast but we wanted a quick, easy bite to get started on site seeing. I agree with other reviewers dated decor, everything in Flamingo smells like old cigarettes.",1
"Went last night before the D Backs game. It was packed but very well staffed. By looking at some of the older reviews, I think the place likely got the hint that they need to better staff themselves. Love the Pear Cider beer. Got the Irish Nachos.they were pretty good. Atmosphere is defiantly similar to a Hooter's.",2
"Out of all the Cracker Barrels we have been to, this overall is the best! Staff was efficient and friendly. Drinks were filled regularly without being asked. Place looked clean nWish the fireplace was lit! Food was consistent and hot. All orders were correct for a party of 6. Wish we lived closer to this location to come back more often.",2
"Serious housekeeping issues. Incredibly rude front desk staff and housekeeping staff. nConfrontational, really. They do not want repeat business here. So unwelcoming, unfriendly, and unaccommodating. But I loved the decor and style of our room and that there was no casino to walk through, calm pool area.",1
"Oh jesus their sushi is uncommonly awful. I'm somewhat proud of Arizona sushi, as it seems sushi purveyors try so hard to make people forget we're landlocked, and they often succeed. Not so here at Ichiban. They seemingly exalt our not next to the ocean situation in quality AND quantity. Not only is the fish putrid, but in the tiniest sliver portions I've seen. Pass.",1
The hubby and wife who run this place are most adorable and the food is delicious. The highlight for me here is the hummus. I am obsessed with it and actually will order the appetizer and then get some to go for the week. I won't get hummus from the grocery store anymore. So delicious. Their pita sandwiches are pretty good as well as the plates.,2
"I had heard great things about this sub shop, but honestly Mr. Goodcents subs are far better. The problem is the bread. It was hard, crumbly, not flavorable. The tomatoes were slimmy and on verge of rotten. I was also disappointed only Pepsi products and NO DR PEPPER on the fountain. On the plus side the turkey was high quality and sliced to order.",1
" ""I would like 3 espeesso shots poured over ice "" manager ""we will have to add water to that "" me ""i dont want water with it "" manager ""thats our corporate policy "" me ""goodbye "" Seriously guys you are making coffee, not creating high art. And you are located in an airport. I suggest that you listen to your customers and just taje their orders and money. Its called business.",1
"We waited only ten minutes or so.not terrible. But then came the wait, you know that wait, when the service stinks, the waitress stinks, and nobody wants to meet your gaze because they're either understaffed or the waitress should finally move on to a job she can handle. nHaving a good time in Vegas and want to keep the buzz going? Run, don't walk, RUN the other way, this place sucks.",1
"I work two blocks away and visit this shop a few times a week. Although two other coffee shops are closer to my office, I always find myself at Crazy Mocha. The morning barista is truly an expert. I usually get a mocha and it is always made perfect. If you are visiting Oakland for school or one of the hospitals, walk right past the other coffee shops. This is the best coffee in Oakland.",2
"Regular lunch spot. Fantastic, fresh food that comes in unreal quantity. The owner and workers make you feel as though they have known you forever, very friendly and very welcoming. As far as I've seen it's cash only and if you don't plan to get it to go you can stand at the counters in the back. There is always a line during the time they are open but it is well worth the wait.",2
Called Troy to provide and install a back yard gate. He responded quickly and came out right away to take measurements and provide an estimate. I never received my estimate and when I asked if he had another job that was delaying him I received no response. Seemed like a nice guy but no follow through and I am still looking for a back gate.,1
"Father and son, Bob and Ben, have been taking care of my home for many many years. I rarely if ever have issues. We recently sold our home and moved into a rental and I plan to continue using Gordon Family's services for as long as they are in business. Great, nice, friendly guys, truly a local family run company and the rates are very reasonable. I highly recommend the Gordons.",2
They don't take reservations and the hostess was rude and also inept. She seated a party of 2 at a 6 top table which meant the wait could have been even longer. Wasn't worth it. There's lots of good restaurants in Pittsburgh that take reservations and or know how to seat people effectively. Go to one of those.,1
"This club is attached to 8 1 2 which makes the 20 cover worth paying. Gogo dancers are yummy. bartenders are so attentive and friendly. They do play mainly house music. Hip Hop music and dance is played on the 8 1 2 side. Drinks are reasonable 8 wells, and they do use big drink cups, and they have a strong poor. This is where most locals come, and the crowd is the typical gay fabulousness bitches.",2
"I stay here once in a while when I come to Vegas, I like the location between the other casinos. I don't play here, because out of all the Total Rewards Casinos, this one is one of the tighest on there slots. The inside of the casino is very pretty and the staff is super nice. The drink servers on the floor are very few and slow. I'm rating this on the hotel, the gaming is another story.",2
"Expected more, for the price. Everything was just ok. No big problems, but nothing was really memorable either. I had the pennoni alla vodka, and my girlfriend had the cannelloni al forno we also had appetizers , and it just seemed pretty pedestrian. Our seating was pretty lousy, right next to the slot machines literally 15 feet away .",1
"Something is definitely right about this place. I had the white fish with capers in a great sauce, potatoes and spinach. Very satisfying. Some people had the turkey which is always delicious. The servers and manager were so anxious to please. 5 wine all the time is great! Mimis always has coupons emailed to us for extra savings. Mimis tries harder!",2
"I've been coming here since they opened up as the first restaurant at Scottsdale Waterfront. Great seafood, steaks, cocktails and wine. Stopped by today for happy hour. The calamari is awesome and you can't go wrong with the 5 glasses of wine. Nice decor and great service. Patrick the bartender is fantastic!",2
"I'm not vegan but they are trying to turn me over! lol I came with my vegan friend and figured I'd try it out. nI did like the food, the chili potatos was good and so was the bean dip and chips. This place is tucked away in a random spot you would never expect it. The chef was very kind and came out and talked to every customer. nReal home cooked style with ""soul "" as chef Mayra would say.",2
Amazing service and dinner. I liked almost everything they brought out. The salad bar was good. I liked how they did family style sides and brought it to the table. I had a hard time flipping my card over to red because they continued to have a lot of stuff. They even took care of me by getting me something specific that I liked and went back and made more. Great churasscaria in Vegas!,2
My favorite brewery in CLT. They seem to focus more on hoppy beers which are my favorite. I'm not a big pale ale person but I highly recommend the Light Rail. For IPA lovers definitely go for the Greenway. I've never tried their baby maker 8.5 abv would put me to bed early but it's not my list. Great atmosphere,2
"I've been eating here regularly for a couple years now. The food is amazing and the staff is even better. I've only had one negative experience ever and not only did they take care of it, but they personally apologized and offered to go above and beyond for the next visit. Couldn't be happier to have this neighborhood gem. Oh, and the new hummus pizza is WONDERFUL.",2
"Wow, I almost forgot about this place and its really a great place for breakfast. I used to frequent the location downtown all the time. This location is much newer and uses the same fantastic ingredients. The ""Trifecta "" was my favorite. For the record First Watch is ""good food, from good people "".",2
very average food missunderstanding on order spoke to one person who never came back to me spoke to our waitress who informed the order was WHAT WAS ORDERED she dismissed me and walked away no atempt to rectify matter very noisy perhaps the students working here need a lesson in customer service and some surpervison,1
"Archi's is definitely worth going out of your way for, The Pad Thai is outstanding. The Thai tea is sweet and nice. Service is friendly and fast. The Rainbow location is the newer out of the two. It's probably me being mental but I like the Flamingo location a little better. They have a descent lunch special as well.",2
"Had lunch here while going to Speed Street and the crispy fish tacos were the best I have ever had. I don't know how they can even get the fish so crispy. Service was excellent and friendly and nobody minded us wearing t shirts and sneakers. Our party also had the grilled salmon, which was cooked perfectly. They are in the process of a remodel but seemed to have it neatly kept.",2
"Abdu was great, from when I walked in he guided through the entire process with the government. Even with out expedition it only took 9 days to get my passport for my trip. The fact he only charges 100 is a bargain for peace of mind knowing it'll be there shortly is well worth the cost. He could easily charge more for the same service. Thanks, Abdu.",2
"I am amazed that anyone liked the food here. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. I mean really, what can you do to spaghetti. Well, I guess you can use old sauce. This stuff was uneatable. The garlic bread was white that means raw dough . The sauce horrible. Perhaps the sandwiches are better, but i doubt it.",1
"I am a regular at this bar, but the food has gone downhill lately. Ordered a salad with chicken, chicken was discolored and old didn't eat it, just pushed it off to the side. Told the bartender Lindsay about it. She stated she would let the cook know.but still charged me for the entire salad and never asked if I wanted something else. Good bar to drink at.but maybe not eat at",1
"I've been really disappointed with the Shell stations in Scottsdale. This is the locatioear my home and I would say 60 of the time, the majority of the pumps are out of order sometimes with bags over them, sometimes they just give you an error. A different shell a couple miles away has the same issues and its automatic car wash did not work.",1
"Good prices for well crafted drinks in a nice setting. Haven't tried their food but it did look good. The place is in a strip mall with not much else around and might be far for the Central Phoenician. They were probably understaffed, but the server was very sincere and apologetic. I'd be back if in the area.",2
"this was awful, will not go here again. It was expensive, and, you could not tell nwhat you were getting. The soups were awful, and, the meals were over 15 and up, it was not worth it. The ice cream desserts were melted and more like Ice cream soup, the coffee drinks were over 4.00. Will never go back here again.",1
"Knew I would be missing my connection in CLT last flight out , so I booked on line while standing at the gate in SFO. Arrived, got luggage, boarded the bus and picked up my car. Drove to GSO and arrived after midnight dropped off the key, picked up my own car and went home. Got the final invoice by email next morning. Perfect!",2
This nightmare of an embarrassment of a dinner . Not only doesn't serve the eggs Benedict but when I ordered the lobster omelet. It arrived 37 minutes later empty restaurant people! with no lobster ! ! ! I can't even imagine the mess this place is when it gets busy. If it even does .This place sucks. Might as well go to McDonald's or starve . Stomach acid is way better.,1
Haven't been here in a while because my last experience was bad. Unfortunately not much has changed. The rice a staple of the 808 plate lunch was dry and tasted old. The Teri chix was not marinated instead just some sticky Teri sauce was globbed over it. And the portions got smaller. Definitely not a go back to place. Sigh guess I'll have to make the drive to Isle Sushi on Eastern.,1
Free shuttle from the hotel. Wow. Stacey was early and very friendly. thank her for her service Guard . and tell her Barb loved her. the instructor. might have been Javier. or George. sorry .don't remember was great. went over position and hand hold. sights and comfort level. great experience. you HAVE TO go there. . and they will match other coupons. just a great time!,2
"Though this restaurant has great decor and is very interesting to look at, we felt it was way overpriced for the food that you receive. The club sandwich was dry and the fries were oversalted. At best the food was just okay, but we were disappointed with the prices. For the type of food that is served, it is significantly higher than other restaurants that have similar menus.",1
"Love this place! Its great to have such a raw, organic, local place here in Vegas! The location is perfect overlooking the lake and I can't help but love the food and juice selection. The only reason they do not get 5 starts is because the juice is way over priced and they skimp on the beets! I can make much more affordable juices at home.",2
"Ate here once and was very very pleased with my meal, and would recommend this place to anyone. Food is priced as you would expect to eat here. Located inside a casino. They loose a star because the tables were placed a bit to close to each other and should of been more spread apart. Trying to enjoy my conversation yet being able to listen to everyone else's is not that great.",2
"I have been to 24 hr fitness Golds gym and neither one of these gyms put me through the intense workouts I was looking for. Terry and Wendy are very knowledgeable outrition , proper weightlifting form , and what programs are suitable for you. I myself have a bad back , bad knees but I have never felt as strong as I do now. Thanks Crossfit Disciples !",2
"The food is OK but I prefer Garcias. The shredded beef on the tacos was bland and the beans had a weird taste. The queso was the best part of the meal but it was runny. Maybe they were having an off day but I don't intend to return. On a side note, the apple crisp was great but that's not what I go to a mexican joint for.",1
"I stayed at this facility over the long weekend for Thanksgiving. The staff frustrated the heck out of me! They have no clue as to what good customer service means. The worst culprit was the hotel manager ""karla "". She has no right working in the service industry with that attitude. Pretty hotel but because of the awfull service I will never go back nor recommend it to anyone!",1
"My favorite stop after a long days work, I usually get a breakfast wrap low calorie smoothie with no added sugar but I so 2 scoops of protein. I eat the wrap, throw the smoothie in the fridge, hit the gym and when I'm done drink the smoothie shower and bed. Perfect place for a busy guy like me. I'll always come back! Lol",2
This restaurant is at the Corner of my street at is a convenient place for a little bite to eat. Staff are nice but the price is to much for the quality you reserve. Not the best Indian meal I have ever had. It is a bit dated and its reputation is better than in reality. nWouldn't tell people not to go but there are better Indian restaurants close by.,1
"This is an excellent place to stop in for a superb selection of beers and wines by the glass. They have excellent appetizers and I highly recommend the cheese plate that comes with assorted nuts, olives, jams, etc. The interior is beautifully decorated. I generally find a bottle or two to take home as well.",2
Thank you Kristen for coming out same day and saving me! I slept wrong on vacation truth is I did not take my pillow and paid for it so my neck was killing me and she came out to loosen me up so I can sleep. She advised me on how to stretch to keep it loose and was great. She has both a table or chair massage options that she brings in her ride to MY HOME.what else can I say it is a great service.,2
"Every time I come to Vegas, this place is a mandatory stop. just be prepared to wait a minimum 1hr! Seated closer to 1.5 2hrs . Try to keep number to eaters to max 4 maybe 5, but that's pushing it So if you can convince your complaining hungover friends that the dozen oysters are amazing and the clams are fresh acquired taste with the clams .Oh I can't forget to add the pan roast!",2
"This place is a BBQ all American dining experience. It has mechanical bulls for the brave drunks and it was pretty packed yesterday. I haven't eaten here before we were going to last night, but then one of my guy friends was in a tee shirt and they wouldn't let him in. It's a BBQ place for Christ's sake stop taking yourself so seriously!",1
"I'm going to make this short and sweet. Went here. Partied here. Loved it here. Despite the crowd, the bartender gets drinks out fast, the music is a freaking mazing and the crowd is a good mix. We partied here until dawn and loved every second of it. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going straight here.",2
I can't believe I've never been to this gem before and it's so close to my house! I LOVE LOVE LOVE my nails and toes. I'm terrible because I didn't get my techs name but he did such a great job! I'm definitely going to this place anytime I need to get my nails done. Very affordable as well! I feel like a princess with my nails I got a full set acrylic with gel and a pedicure.,2
"I wish that I had read the other reviews! My experience was exactly the same. I purchased an item that they never delivered in fact, they never had it in stock and now they have failed to refund me! AND THEY NEVER CALL YOU BACK OR EMAIL BACK! Now I have to work with my credit card company to file a notice of fraud, etc. PLEASE beware when you shop at this website. IT IS A SCAM!",1
Sorry but I'm used to a bit more upgrades. Beds are comfortable but no coffee maker in our room. Prices for room service are crazy. 16 for a grilled cheese sandwich plus an 8 delivery charge! Problem with the vacation package we purchased through Southwest Airlines. They suck! and so the manager gave us a 2 for1 on the buffet! Woopee! I'm not a high roller here and I guess I never will be!,1
"This place is like one of those slick CBS procedural dramas. It is pretty formulaic, very well executed, somewhat predictable, and yet still very tasty. About what you'd expect from a Fox establishment, only dialed up. A lot of style, a little less substance. Nothing really new but that doesn't mean that I still can't enjoy the solid execution.and the tender, tasty Waygu.",2
"This place rules.I love a non coparte business,escpcially locally owned and brewed beer and killer food.the daily specials are the b MB.cometh staff is good to look at and always friendly,the managers and owner are always walking around making sure everything is ok.and you can grab beer to go.perfect,gotta watch out for that raj IPA,strong,I call it ""no knees ""eat drink and be merry,vi la vida",2
"The atmosphere was quite pleasant. That's the only reason for 2 stars, because the food. Big MEH. We had heard all the rave reviews. Methinks these people have never been to California and tasted what real fresh Mex is like. Lindo Michoacan is NOT all that. Most of the stuff is pure canned flavor. Save yourself the trip. Head over to Mandalay Bay and get some decent food at the Border's Grill.",1
"I'm so disappointed in Union Cab. A company that usually has excellent customer service refused my husband and me a ride not once, but twice, to a location less than five minutes away from the airport. While I understand it was busy, the rudeness and refusal of a short fare for a larger or is completely unacceptable. It will be a long time before I choose to use them again.",1
"gross, ni ordered the easiest thing on the menu grilled cheese! it was kind of burnt at the crust area and extremely oily and greasy! none of my friends enjoyed their food either, in fact one girl didnt like it so much she just sent it back and walked out. prissy i know .but people at the table compared it to McDonald's grilled mushrooms. just blah.",1
"Did not get to stay long. Popped in for a quick drink before our Vegas wedding renewal and took about 10 minutes for someone to get our order. Immediately after the drinks came they sent out a bottle of champagne! How nice! I wish we could have stuck around to enjoy it, but the limo showed up and off we went. Looked like a lot of fun.",2
"Mario Batalli's restaurant was really very good. When we got home, I bought the cookbook I recommend making the oxtail ragu with gnocchi.yummy! . nTo start, my husband and I enjoyed the warm lamb's tongue salad and beef cheek ravioli. Both were delicious. The main course was equally good, the food is extremely rich and filling but the flavors are vibrant and it is hard to stop eating!",2
"Dude, don't eat at Filiberto's. I do not understand why they are so popular all over the Valley. Maybe it's good for drunks whose stomachs are so polluted with skunky beer and whose palate has been ruined by smoking cheapass ditchweed, but the food at Filiberto's looks like someone already ate it and they put it on a paper plate. I tried it twice to be fair and I feel lucky to be alive.",1
"THE BEST! Always cool inside, great flavor choices, delicious toppings, and reasonably priced! Our family of six can get cool treats well within budget unless it's just too tempting and the kids put a little more in their cup which happens once in a while. Hmmm. Maybe we will have to go for a visit today Sorry Golden Spoon. Yogurtland is worth the farther drive!",2
The wings were okay but certainly not good enough for a place with the name of the food in the name of the restaurant. The service the 2 times I've been here is friendly but super super S L O W. I like the atmosphere. TV's everywhere. very family friendly. but I don't like the smell in the restaurant bar and I don't care for the S L O W service.,1
I ate at the one in austin a million times and it was always great. But this was my second time to this location and I'm not going back. Burned pizza is not acceptable. Flat soda sucks. And server not checking to be sure everything is ok just makes me mad. So I had to post on yelp. Maybe they can fix this place should be great.,1
What a great place to eat. My wife and I just happened to be staying at the Bluegreen resorts where this place is located. We decided to stay in the first night and try this place out. Thank God we did cause it was great! Very friendly staff and on their game! We will be back for sure! Don't miss out on a great experience!,2
Had the sirloin steak and was not impressed. Wings for appetizers were nothing special something I could've bought and made from a box. BFs steak was good but it was smothered in sauce.so not sure if it was the sauce or the actual meat. Mine was super dry and I didn't finish it I did get a 10 discount through my employer so that was nice!,1
"Went to this place on glowing reviews from a native, however, after the hype I was pretty disappointed. The service was really great, but I wanted a tasty pizza, and this pizza was not tasty. Maybe I am spoiled coming from the East Coast great pizza , and then living in Chicago mecca of pizza . The crust was so blah and the sauce had no flavor.",1
"Service is not good. The food tastes flat. The ambiance is somewhere between a sports bar, a mongolian BBQ and a cheap chinese restaurant. The drinks are not good and prepared by non professional barmen and barwomen. I had to ask for the bowls to be replaced because they were dirty and the waitress didn't see anything wrong! For the same money I can have better food across the street at Pei Wei.",1
"Le plan B est un bar que j'appr u00e9cie pour aller boire un verre lors d'un 5 7 ou avant d'aller au restaurant. J'aime son ambiance chaleureuse et calme, la terrasse est tr u00e8s agr u00e9able pour profiter du beau temps. nJ'aime y prendre une bi u00e8re ou un bon verre de vin tout en grignotant u00e0 plusieurs l'assiette de fromages. C'est une bonne place pour se retrouver entre amis.",2
I always get sucked into this store! I come here expecting to buy one or two things but than before I know it I have a full shopping cart! This place is the best place to go if you want some free samples. My only complaint is the lines are so long because everyone wants to buy the whole store. other than that its a great place if you want to buy bulk.,2
"Popped in here for a few drinks after lunch in Stockbridge and was quite impressed. Great range of beers and spirits available and the bar staff I spoke to were pleasant and knowledgeable. Was quite a dressy crowd, though this could have been people out for Father's Day lunches and the atmosphere was quite relaxed. I'll definitely be back and would like to return for food at some point.",2
"Horrendous customer service! The night manager used profanity when arguing with me about an order she COMPLETELY screwed up for a party of 4 and when asking for a refund she responded, ""Have a great night "" while hanging up on me! I'm sorry Geno's but you just lost a loyal client and I'll make sure others are aware of the kind of service you provide there!",1
"This place always smells horrible. The only reason I use to shop here is because it was close to my house. They have made lots of upgrades lately, but it's still kinda nasty. If you can avoid this place, do so. Only go here if you're in a rush or as a last resort. They are owned by Kroger, just like Food 4 Less, but apparently this Smith's doesn't have the same standards. Avoid.",1
"So, I did a take out for my bf after I had lunch with my friends. He had the Caesar salad, which he didn't eat, and the margherita pizza. He had a diarrhea after eating the margherita. He said it tasted okay when he ate it. But after 3 hours, he got sick. He didn't eat anything for breakfast so definitely something was wrong with the pizza.",1
I found a coackroach in my pho. It was a tiny roach maybe the size of a penny coin. The owner was really apologetic about the cockroach. He waived our bill for our party of 7. He apologized repeatedly about it. I wasn't upset at him nor the restaurant. I know it was an accident and they didn't want it to happen. I'm kinda scared what is in the kitchen tho.,1
"A nice, small Italian restaurant in the Brookdale Plaza on Rocky River off I 485, it has great Veal Parmigiana and all kinds of pizzas. It's a very inexpensive getaway and Frank Sinatra lovers will definitely frequent the place because his songs are constantly being played. Ask for Holly to be your waitress.",2
"I went there with my own fabric, asking her to make some curtains for my girls' room. The Dimensions were small 2 windows at 20 in X 20 in, and 3 at 16 in X 16 in. She quoted me at 500. Ha ha ha good one! That's crazy! I don't care how good she is, that's ludicrous! I found someone on Craigslist who did same work for 60.",1
I enjoyed the food and the selection. Best 6 buffet ever. nYou know going to a 6 that the meat quality is going to be a little iffy and they need to be doing something to money money. I went to the buffet and felt like I was speaking like king. The food tasted great and had a variety of different flavors. I wish I lived by so i could hit them up more often.,2
"Pleasantly surprised about the cleaniness of the location, the friendliness of the baristas and just the overall atmosphere. Reminds me of a small town cafe with the general coffee condiments centered for easy access. Drinks were made to order and have never failed to keep satisfied! Just need to get a drive through and all will be perfecto!",2
"I've been going to Manuel's with my family for years. They have very good chips and salsa, it's definitely their strong point. Unfortunately they no longer carry black beans and their refried beans contain lard. As a vegetarian, I cannot eat here any longer unless I want just chips and salsa or a cheese crisp. Sad, sad day ' ",1
"Came here during CES with few friends, the reservation was made for indoors, and when we arrived they asked us to sit outside freezing . The hostess said we would have to wait for 15 minutes if we wanted to sit indoors, we decided to wait but after 25 min and a very RUDE attitude we gave up and left. nSTAY AWAY.",1
"Well. It took about 25 minutes to get my pizza because, even though I paid for it, no one ever made it. The manager apologized and offered free dessert. The pizza itself.is close but not great. The product was very wet and all the ingredients slipped off the dough. For the price, once they get out the kinks and make the product, this place will be decent. However, they're nowhere near there.",1
"Great atmosphere and everything in the restaurant were clean, including the soy sauce bottle. The fish were really fresh. The owner introduced himself to us as well and recommended some delicious ponyu sauce sashimi. The service was great, they were always there to refill your drinks and tea. Overall, I would really enjoy my visit and will come back again. Also, awesome hot sake!",2
Worst buffet ever and especially for what they charge you. And the guy working the omelet station is horrible. Argued that the omelet i ordered wasn't what I ordered and gave me another customers order. This place isn't busy by any means. You have two omelets in front of you. How hard is that to manage? Undercooked bacon and undercooked sausage. No selection. And no flavor to anything.,1
"We came here to eat probably around 1 00am on New Year's after the fireworks since we were hungry. But all they had available was their breakfast buffet. It was mediocre at best. But i got their wings and they were super spicy. I've had their wings at other Hooters and they weren't this terrible. All of the other food was terrible too. However, the memory is a bit fuzzy since it was New Year's",1
"I love Veraldi's! I've been in once for a cut and twice for color, and Leese is a genius I've been 100 satisfied with her work every time. Susan is also wonderful they listen to you and make great suggestions, and they are never pushy. The salon itself is small, cozy, and provides a great atmosphere to relax, laugh, and have fun in. The pricing is also fabulous. Cannot recommend it enough!",2
We stopped in here on our way out of the Plaza. i must say the girl behind the counter was incredibly friendly and nice. She was a delight in todays bad service world. But it was late and the cupcakes were very stale and dried out. Seems if they can't keep them fresh they should close earlier. I was sad I ate all those carbs and fat for a disappointing experience.,1
"The service lacks ambition! My waitress took our order after about 10 minutes of waiting. Not only are we the only ones here but after she took our order she sits back down 2 tables behind us and eats, I really hope she washed her hands. There are no free refills and they carry mostly coke products out of a fridge. Still waiting on my food. Will update after ward.",1
"I must not have great luck with Holiday Inns, especially in Pennsylvania. This hotel is decent enough in terms of looks and rooms, and pricing. However, one really annoying thing about it is their vending machine situation. They are not very well stocked, and I was sent to multiple floors by their lobby staff, all in the search of a bottle of water",1
One of the top 4 places in Phoenix to get a burger. Try the Delux Burger with the Baugette Bun which is awesome. If you like sweet potato fries this is the place to get them. This place is always busy for a reason with high quality ingredients and fast service. Great central location and is open till 2 00 am,2
"Friendly staff, quick groom and competitive prices. My only complaint, and the reason for the 4 stars was my dog smelled horrible after her grooming. Normally my dog smells great after grooming, that was so not the case. The one on banksville is much closer to my house, and will be using that one next time. I hope for the same cut, but better smell ",2
"I guess I shouldn't expect too much after eating at various ramen shops in Japan, but the ramen at this place was salty and there was nothing really going for it. The place was cute and with character particularly Asian females for those with yellow fever , and if not for that it'd probably be out of business fairly quickly. I wouldn't go back there again for the ramen.",1
My wife and I went on a Friday around 6pm. We didn't have to wait to be seated even though it looked quite busy. Our service was excellent. We ordered an the smokehouse nacho with pork appetizer. It came out quickly and they were some of the best nachos I've ever had. My burger and wife's pulled pork sandwich also came out quickly and both tastes perfect. Couldn't ask for more.,2
This was the easiest buying experience I have ever enjoyed. Jason and Donald were exceptional. I got exactly the deal I wanted. Very classy. Leo in finance was so much fun. This is the second car I have purchased from them and it has been a pleasure. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because we were there far longer than we should have been.,2
"Every one that worked there was extremely rude, when ordering my pizza the guy was rude, the server was also extreuy rude and we were not given a seat and had to wait for a long time when there were many seats open, then get this about half way threw are food we were told we had to move because it was getting bussy and a bigger party was comeing in with no reservation, smh rosaties smh",1
"Maybe we just went on a bad day last December when everything was closing early due to snow. However, they had some cool games but it would have been crazy to pay for a full day when we could only play for two hours. The bathrooms were disgusting and the entire place smelled of raw sewage. I felt like I was in the French Quarter in New Orleans!",1
"Excellent Filipino BBQ at this place. I was visiting Phoenix for work and needed to satisfy my Pinoy craving and this place hit the spot. I'm not sure what the owner's name was, but she made sure I was taken care. The liempo here is one of the best I've ever had so make sure to order that. The place is located in a shopping plaza so keep that in mind when you're looking for it.",2
"I've never been a PF Chang's fan. I like maybe one dish the fried calamari, which is pretty hard to screw up anywhere you go. I went recently because of a business dinner. They get two stars instead of the normal one I'd give them because the service was friendly and attentive, and we got a private room for no extra cost.",1
"I really want to like this place. I've been before and remember the pizza being okay. I ordered something that closely resembled hamburger helper with cheese sauce. I really didn't care that it looked like that, but I did care that it was frozen in the middle. The adult beverage was lackluster as well. I really wished that someone would have checked back to see if I was enjoying my meal.",1
"Two words Pastor taco! This is a must try if you love crushing taco's. The fact that they have beer is a plus. The salsa bar hits the spot. Don't forget to get the elote! nThe Mariachi Monday is a bit too loud but entertaining. I sit with the kids while the wife fights through the multiple lines so its a win win for me, all the good food none of the aggravation",2
Famous Portuguese chicken done right. The spices and sauce give the chicken a distinctive flavor and the fries are also delicious. There's also some interesting international bottled beverages to choose from whether cola or juices . This place can get busy and often has a line but I think it's worth it for the rich flavorful chicken for a cheap and quick meal.,2
"This review is long overdue. It was our first night in town and the worst dinner ever. Way over priced! Their ""New York "" steak was a sirloin. Went to the Triple George the next night and got a better meal for 40 less with drinks and dessert. Oh, and the waiter was two feet from my chair for the whole meal. You might think this would be a good thing but it was kind of creepy.",1
"DO NOT SHOP HERE! nWent in here hoping to get help, admitting I didn't know much and they made me feel stupid. Very rude, short, and too cool for school. If you want good service goto bobs used motorcycles. I would rather throw my bike in a ditch then spend another dollar here, amazed they're still in business",1
"Who would have thought! You couldn't guess it from the location and by the way it looks but this place is a great sushi find. I wouldn't go as far as trying the dollar sushi but they definitely have some great items. The place is pretty small, I usually head straight to the bar for quick service. My favorite item now is The Boss roll, very fresh and delicious. You should definitely try it!",2
"This place is nice, if you can get them to stay open until their stated hours on the door. The doors say ""Last Load 9 45 "" but every time I've tried to go there after 8 30, the male attendant says they are closed, and doesn't even look up from his phone. I'd be ready to rate them 5 stars, because it is pretty clean and the machines always work, but he's a friggin' jagoff.",1
"It took TWO months, 20 phone calls and 20 emails and I finally got my shoes which had glue all over them. NOT HAPPY If you can buy the shoes in store.good for you but don't expect anything better than CRAP if you need to place an order with their factory. Carlos, the owner is cute and charming but has terrible business sense and lack of honesty. Go somewhere else!",1
"This is one of those fast in out type of breakfast places that serves such good food. The eggs are always done right just as you asked for them and the hash browns when ordered crispy aren't just burnt on the outside but soggy on the inside. If you're ever in the neighborhood you should stop in for breakfast, you won't regret it.",2
"I'm only giving them 2 starts because if you're not a cowboy, you won't be welcomed. The food gets 5 stars, but after our experience I believe there exists racial discrimination from the wait staff towards the customer. And that does not bode well for an overall dining experience. IF I eat there again, I'll order take out.",1
"H u00f4tel correct, proche a u00e9roport mais sans nuisance sonore. Chambre simple avec lavabo dans entr u00e9e. Pour le prix cela pourrait u00eatre mieux, et un peu moins u00e9triqu u00e9. Seul int u00e9r u00eat service navette a u00e9roport sympathique et efficace. C'est un lieu utilitaire et il ne faut pas en attendre plus.",1
"Not a huge fan. I got the roast beef panini and could have whipped up a better one myself. Literally toasted bread, mustard, roast beef and cheese. Two stars for a great locations. People watching in Vegas is incredibly entertaining. If you travel all the way to Vegas for vacation, save your tummy space for something yummier and more local.",1
"Went after workout on Sat noon for lunch. Had tenderloin chicken combo with baked potato, bread and corn on the cobb 1 2 an ear . Very good and filling. Lots of TVs tuned to different college football games, and off track betting if you want to play horses didn't for now . Servers were prompt and kind.",2
Flight was a perfect escape from the casino floor. It wasn't crowded and we were able to get drinks very quickly. The drinks were quite pricey. It was a place we were able to chill in for a bit before moving on to the next thing. The set up and layout lends itself to a lot of in and out because it's so open. It's also a great pit stop if you are waiting to get into the LAX night club.,2
The only constant to this location is that they can only be counted on to screw up your order. The staff will forget parts of your order or not give you honey packets when you ask for them or their being a very long wait despite being the only customer there. Bottom line this location can and will screw up your order every chance they get. Go to a different location.,1
"I don't know what happened but our cocktails were poorly made and expensive. We paid 13 each for Hendricks martinis, they filled the glass less then halfway. I thought it was a joke. Ended up getting a couple appetizers that were tasty and left. Bill came to 81 without tip. All and all very meh experience.",1
"If Jared weren't such a dork, Subway may have gone for five. They recently boosted their rating in my book considerably by taking a queue from Quizno's and allowing you the option to toast any of their subs. I am still partial to the old classic, the Subway Melt, though I have rarely been disappointed by any of even their most boring sandwiches. I'm glad that Subway has stuck around.",2
"This place is a joke. Seriously. The service was amazing but if I wanted just service I would go and get a message. I can't believe that this ""Resturant "" sells itself as a beef hamburger joint. Get anything but the chilli or hamburgers and you'll be fine well you'll be but your wallet won't. Stupid overpriced. The best thing I can say is the draft beer is ice cold.",1
"Well as it turns out, the owners shut the place down, and in the process f ed over a bunch of their employees. I know a few that worked there. Managment didnt even stay in the meeting for 3 minutes after they told everyone they would be unemployed. I don't think I could ever give this company my money ever again, no matter what iron chef they bring into the restaurant.",1
"I was brought here by my team at work and was truthfully afraid I'd starve I'm not a vegetarian . The environment was fun and inviting and I ordered the ""Big Wac "" and would you know, it was much better than the Big Mac! Five stars because this place is truly awesome! Caution on parking, though, there's not much of it and a lot of people don't seem to know how to negotiate the lot.",2
"I own a BMW 325i. I made a phone call to find out if I needed an appointment for a diagnostic and how much it would cost. The man on the other end wasn't rude, but he was NOT helpful at all. Seemed like he didn't care to get any business. I just wasn't thrilled with the way the phone call was handled. By the way, the diagnostic costs 94.",1
I love supporting local business and I'm happy to say I will be back to this one! ALL the donuts looked amazing. I got a red velvet donut and a cinnamon roll. Both were delicious! I can't wait to go back and try something else. They have a wide variety of donuts and pastries.it will be hard to choose what's next! nThe inside could use some decoration but I'm really just there for the food ,2
Wings were old and dry and gross. Burger was burnt to a crispy and loaded with beyond old lettuce.They forgot the zucchini and mushrooms but im sure they would have been equally gross like everything else. This place is disgusting. If you wouldn't eat this food yourself then don't serve it to your customers.,1
"Why anyone would pay 6 for a tiny cup of mediocre ice cream is beyond me. We ordered a small ""sweet cream "" vanilla with Oreos and strawberries. It was 5.25 plus tax. The 4 oz. cup had exactly one Oreo half, cracked in half, inside the middle of the ice cream, and three soggy berries on top. Supremely overpriced, and no good. Take your business elsewhere.",1
Breakfast was a bust.mediocre food. Bacon was disgusting. I was hoping for more as Gilbert needs more breakfast places but you are much better off sticking with the Farmhouse downtown or on Gilbert south of Elliott . They both get really busy with long lines but worth it. Very bummed this Cafe was not good.,1
"Incredibly disappointing experience. Boyfriend and I are big fans of Cake Boss, so of course we wanted to come here. The line was over an hour long, and the prices are ridiculous. The actual pastries are sooo overrated. Sweet and flaky, yes, but just okay. There are so many other places on the strip that have amazing desserts, and this isn't one of them. Don't fall into the hype.",1
"Went in to buy 2 beers tonight. The cashier was nice but tired and made a mistake on the change. She had to call the manager who was so rude. He said I couldn't buy 2 beers, although I have bought 2 beers there before. He has NO customer service what so ever! Who made him a manager? Not going back to that store ever!",1
The decor was outdated along with the menu and food. A friend recommended it. It's an average Italian restaurant with classic Italian food that you would expect at any average Italian restaurant. They did not break out with new flavors. The quality was also average. I will not be going back on my own free will.,1
"Solid sammies, great desserts.not a HUGE selection but its plenty. The service has been great the times I've been there and they're usually pretty fast getting your food to you. However, one of the times I went was around the lunch hour and we felt it waited about 20mins til our buzzer buzzed signaling sammy amazingness!",2
"Went here to fill up our SHINEY new Starbucks tumblers with fresh Christmas drinks! I could not believe how busy it was! The staff handled the massive amount of people with Speed, accuracy and a smile to boot! Stephanie did an awesome job navigating my SIX confusing drink orders! A big thank to the Starbucks crew for such a great job under such pressure on Christmas Day !",2
"Went to Filiberto's because I wanted fish tacos. Was very disappointed because the fish tasted as if it was sitting out for hours maybe even days, and recooked. I took one bite and that was it. When I approached the workers not only did they deny that the fish was bad, but they refused to give me an order of something else at no cost. Very disappointed and never going back!",1
"Starting to get annoyed by the flavors. They rarely ever change their flavors and are stuck on horrible flavors. I rather drive the extra 2 min to golden spoon. The sad thing is i use to love this place at the beginning. The flavors were amazing and they switched them up, now they don't. Loss the cake batter and georgia peach once in a while !",1
i wish i didnt have to select any stars. My mom is a regular client and had booked an appointment for herself my aunt and myself as my brother is gettin married today. We showed up for our 10am appointment and the shop was not open contrary to the sign saying they open at 9am. No one even bothered to call to let us know that they wouldnt be opening today.,1
"For an off Strip steakhouse experience reminiscent of old school, semi formal dining from the Las Vegas of yesteryear, you can't beat Becker's. The steaks, sides, wines, and ambience are well worth the money. If you want to splurge on top quality surf 'n turf at least once in your lifetime , this is the place for you.",2
"It's all right. Typical bar that's not that good but tries to make up for it with scantily clad women joint. Think Library or Hooters, maybe Heart Attack Grill with the exception of that it's a grill, obviously. Food is mediocre, beer is pretty much the same as you can get in any other bar, so go if you are a lonely guy who likes to look at girls, basically.",1
"I love Marco's pizza, I recently tried it because my friend works there and she recommended it. Their ingredients were fresh, and I especially love their crust topper options. I added Roma seasoning and garlic to my pizza, it tasted amazing and my hands were covered in garlic butteriness afterwards, but I've never complained about that.",2
"What a great facility in a convenient part of Myers Park. Went herd for a Yelp Kicks Butt class, and was very impressed with the staff and workout. A good mix of newbies and experienced folks for the Crossfit class, and they made all of us feel comfortable with the workout. A few shakes were even handed out post workout. Thanks for the workout Dar company. Can't wait to return!",2
"Do yourself a favor and skip this McDonald's, I went in and ordered 2 iced coffees, as I waited for my order, they called every except mine.people from the drive thru kept coming in and returning their orders, this McDonald's is completely unorganized so save yourself some time and a headache and go to another one. We ended up tossing our coffees, it tasted a little tart for my liking.",1
"I've been to Chase several times and it's a nice park. Last night however I sat in the Club reserved level. The seats are nice but you are never in them. I was at the Club level bar and then the Arizona Baseball Club area. They are a lot of fun and add to a unique baseball experience. Great food and a great selection of alcohol. I don't think I can ever go back to ""normal "" seats again.",2
"This place is ridiculous. I went inside and stood in line for 10 minutes watching the staff just screw around in the kitchen every 30 seconds looking over at me right in the eyes while they weren't doing anything. It was very frustrating as a customer, I walked out and I'll never walk back into this place again.",1
"If you call this authentic Mexican food you are probably not Mexican. I really hate giving bad reviews but this was one of worse restaurants I've been to. Food is disgusting, more specifically it is bland, greasy and low quality. The place was also pretty dirty. It looked like they hadn't mopped in weeks. I would only recommend this place to my worst enemy.",1
"This more like a 4 1 2 stars. The food was great, the sangria was great, the service was great the dessert was delicious. The only down side to this place is, like most expensive restaurants, they are very stingy about the food. nThe excuse that Jaleo uses is that it a tapas restaurant. Well, it a good one. nThis is a good place to celebrate with some good friends!",2
Great soup.great salads and sandwiches. Very friendly staff. Disappointed they are not open on Sundays. Wish they had a location closer to Chandler Mall. Nice touch to have a chocolate dipped strawberry given to you for free with your meal. Wish they would consider white chocolate dipped strawberries as well! ,2
"A good Japanese restaurant with a very nice variety of dishes to choose from. Ambiance is comfortable and the service is friendly. We had a couple of bowls of ramen and some mackerel sushi. The ramen was good, but if you can bear to drive another 10 minutes and want some REALLY good ramen, go to Monta on Spring Mountaiear Decatur instead.",2
"I love that they have this store in Town Square, it makes it a lot faster trip than going to Plant Hollywood. The girls that work there are helpful, but what i LOVE about this place is their return policy. If you do not like the product you can return it fast easy no questions asked. You should pick up a Dior Lipstick Addict while your there, my favorite! lol",2
"Dosa was thick, soft and limp. That's not how they're supposed to be thin and crispy was the expectation. And the potato palya filling? Meh. There was also some ugly pink colored yoghurt based concoction on my plate. The sambar was OK, the coconut chutney left something to be desired and there was no cilantro chile chutney, which I missed.",1
"I don't know why I continue to waste my time with this place overpriced mediocre food and the most unfriendly staff in Arcadia. I guess I just want it to be good because of the location, but I'm over it. Last time I'm there we walk in and ask if we can watch the NBA Playoff game the bar tender tells us he's rather watch the hockey so sorry. Pretty intense.",1
"It's a quick drive away from the strip, and located in Chinatown with all the other Asian restaurants. It's a typical Chinese HK restaurant. Food was okay. The BBQ items are okay, but I think they could be better. Not bad though. We also ordered some non BBQ items, and they were pretty tasty. It's a good place to grab a quick bite, as they served us pretty fast. Note, this place is cash only!",2
This place needs help. I came for the batting cages. It looked closed when I pulled into the big parking lot. But at the end of the creepily quiet building is where we buy the tokens for the cages. I only saw two employees for this place. I so wish more people come here. It could be a real hot stop.,1
"This place keeps going down, down, down . rubbery dough, cheap ingredients and crappy cheese. Sandwiches come complete with stale bread and cheap supermarket ingredients, I can make a much better sandwich at home. The service is awful and slow, so we're done with GN! Interesting how many 5 star reviews they have given how bad the food and service are.",1
"What a wonderful experience! Amazing modern french cuisine. Great wine. Knowledgeable and extremely friendly staff. As regular foodies from NY, we are used to some great food but I would put Chef Audrey Dufresne's creations up there with the best in New York! nA great casual neighborhood gem! Something not to be missed in Montreal.",2
"Service was as excellent as it could get. Ahi Katsu special was as good as it sounds. My daughter had the kalbi ribs that they cooked to her preference and even cut into little pieces which saved me about 20 mins. The Mac salad has potatoes in it, nice touch. The fries were salty but delicious. Definitely headed back to try the garlic shrimp.",2
"If your Korean don't bother. If not it is a sad representation. There palate has long since expired, like their kimchee! OMG! How can a respectable Korean place serve a fellow Korean who spoke to them in their native tongue severely over the hill kimchee. OLD kimchee, our STAPLE in any Korean restaurant means crappy food. Also horrible service. This hole in the wall should be walled up.",1
The noise at lunch here left the most distinctive impression on me so I guess the food was good. I had the arugula salad and a less than flavorful iced tea. Everyone else enjoyed their food but we all had to shout at each other in order to be heard. The best part of my experience was leaving. Come when it's quiet and you might enjoy it more.,1
"Yes, the birds are cool, but ultimately I am coming for the beer. And the beer is not so great. Last time we were here they were out of almost everything only one of their own beers on tap . What's the point of coming to a brewery if all I can drink is domestics? Seems like I ended up in a menagerie of Coors Light and macaws.bummer.",1
"This place did not live up to the hype at all. Over priced average sushi at best. The took advantage of the table by suggesting every over priced item on the menu and bringing them out even when they were not ordered. Poor customer attention, typical vegas take advantage position. One thing I enjoyed was the whole fish it was great but 100? really?",1
This was my 3rd time trying to win any money at this place. What a rip! Didn't win a thing. The sad thing is that the Station Casino's are geared towards the locals. They don't even give any play anymore. Just keep taking money from the people who live there to build more casino's. Two stars for Fatburgers within the casino.,1
"My wife saw ""Under cover boss "" on TV, and decided to try Popeyes on 6111 W. Sahara Ave ST 5637 on 3 03 2012. nShe was very excited and when she mentioned the TV program, she was met by a very Unfriendly, Rude, Ignorant and Strange attitude.it totally spoiled the whole experience and her appetite.never again.Tel ID LK940606 n8 pce chick 14.39 mash 1.89 Tot 17.60 what a waist of time and money.",1
Angels received two stars only because it has a great draft beer selection. Poor ownership management decision to have last call 10 30 on a Thursday night and crappy acoustics ruin this place. Downtown Phoenix has been dying to have a place like this. So extend the hours of operation and install acoustics please!,1
"Had breakfast. One of our better meals in last trip to Vegas. Pricey, but very well done. I had a berry smoothie and short rib hash. Both were excellent. My wife had eggs benidict. Simple but very good. If you are prepared to blow big bucks on a buffet, go here, spend the same amount and have a meal you will remember. Can't wait to get back and try the crab cake eggs bendict.",2
We were so disappointed. This place was so poorly ran. We went Sunday 23rd of oct. never had been before. Will never go back. Dirty unorganized long lines out of everything. Food was horrible. Very disappointing. You would think for on month out of the year it would be grand. Seems to me they are money hungry and really don't even care.,1
"I have been there twice 2 times too many. I had acrylic nails put on and they looked hideous. Prices are decent for a reason. The people were friendly, but the actual service was horrible. The nails were crooked and I had to go home and fix them myself. I actually thought to myself how stupid can these people be it's your job. Either way. don't go there.",1
"First of all, please hire people at least willing to try to speak English. Second of all, make your food somewhere half as good as Wienerschnitzel. The prices are exorbitant even for the airport, which is sad because the food is abysmal. My sausage tasted like something my dog ate out of the litter box, threw up, ate again, then puked into the center of a rancid casing.",1
"I had a great experience today as a first time patient. The staff is professional, kind, and welcoming. Dr. Kessler took the time to explain each step as he did my exam, and discussed the best options given my fact pattern and needs. They have a great selection of frames, pricing is very fair, and completely transparent. Highly recommended!",2
"so fun! this place now take visa's, as i was just reading another review that said they didn't. OK, so I'm gonna out myself. I'm not gay , but still had the best time here. everyone is super friendly, and just looking for a good time, and good music to dance to. i now crave going to this spot with friends. i would definitely recommend anyone was wants to have fun to visit the Girl Club.",2
I think I found my new favorite Sushi Bar in South Charlotte. I randomly went in for lunch one day and the freshness of the sushi was amazing. Every dish I ordered was beautifully artistically presented. Atmosphere is hip and fun. Service was good. The sushi chefs are extremely friendly and kind. I've been back multiple times since my first visit. A must try if you are in the area.,2
"Went to the movies and decided to take them up on their offer to make it right before I saw the flick. No one was around. No cook, no counter person. The counter person in the food stand next door called us over to have a burger. What was I to do? It is fast food after all and nothing is slower theo one to take my order. They failed.",1
I'm sorry to post this but I had to. I been coming here for a while and always been happy when sitting at the bar. Nice service and good food. But today while at dinner i sat at a booth and ROACHES were everywhere. At one point I saw three on the bench across from me. My skin is still crawling. Fix this problem ASAP.,1
"We went here Monday. 3 servers standing around laughing talking, but no one came to our table for drink orders or even to greet us and say they would be with us shortly after they were done talking gossip. after 7 min we left. Slow service and they were empty. We spent our 40.00 at a different restaurant.",1
"HORRIBLE SERVICE. nThe waitress was verbally slapping me, all I did was ask for a water and a Coke. she said why do you need two drinks? Like what are you even asking for? My buddy decided he was susho rolls she said you know we have burgers and actual food! She was awful! but the food picked up some of the slack!",1
"There is nothing good to say about this store except that the food is kosher. There is no customer service. In fact, most employees are down right rude. They have the attitude that they are doing you a favor to sell you kosher food whether it is bad or good, what you need or not, just take it and thank them. Avoid if at all possible.",1
"Don't shop here if you work nights or are heading somewhere at night and need to pick up something quick. They only open TWO registers and they don't care enough about their customers to fix this lack of ""Service "" . After I complained, it STILL happened! Next stop the BIG bosses or BBB! I ALWAYS get results that way! CustomerServiceFAIL",1
This place has the WORST customer service. complete a HOLES! nThey cut my dog. gave him razor burn and then denied it. so months later we said ehh we will give another chance and called to make an appt. and they said we cant come back. HAHAH wow . you messed up! nPRICES ARE SOOO CRAZY HIGH ITS INSANE! ntry. best friend groomers on grand dysart,1
"The breakfast we get delivered it's the BOMB! I wasn't as impressed with their lunch, but it was filling they deliver which is fantastic! We order so much that they put in extras which I thought was really nice. The people are fantastic to work with. They go the extra mile! Thank you Lord for PPR! BTW the sausage cheese omlet is even better than the one I make love!",2
"After a long day at the Go Pool, decided we needed a buffet. Let me first start by saying.Save your money by not going here. Very expensive for Hometown buffet quality food. Go to Caeser's buffet. Very expensive, bad attempt at sushi, bad quality seafood, and horrible service. Went for dinner and it is poorly lit and servers are hardly ever around. Go somewhere else!",1
"This place has pretty good Thai Food and is reasonably priced. The Pineapple curry is excellent, highly recommended! We typically order the food for pick up, as they have a drive thru pickup window, which is convenient. The service inside is good, unless its busy, then be prepared for a little wait.",2
"Terrible service, no gloves worn handeling food after touching money, the AC was not working and it was 100 degrees outside! After managment was told about the unsanitary food handling they didn't even say we are sorry or offer and compensation. They were angry we said we wanted differnt food. I would now recommend this store to ANYONE!",1
"Awesome Electrician! I was referred to Howard by a friend. I am remodeling my kitchen and Howard installed under cabinet LED lighting to brighten up the place. He was quick, professional and the lights looked great. The best part is that I can leave the LED lights all night without worry about a gigantic power bill! Glad I now have an Electrician to call!",2
"While the food was good standard restaraunt hotel food, the dinner entrees I got was smothered in oil. I asked for a side of steamed veggies and specified no oil. They came covered in butter. So. If you're looking for something healthy or even just something not overkill heavy, this is not a good place.",1
"arrogant, unprofessional, disinterested sales people. We were treated poorly on 3 consecutive visits basically treated as if we should be extremely humbled and grateful that they'd deign to sell us an Audi. We didn't buy one went across the street to Mercedes. Far better service and professionalism.",1
If you can't afford going to a high end salon then this place is a great option. It's never too busy and all the stylists there are friendly. Lacey always gives me a great cut so asking for her is suggested. Not really into sports but if you're into the big game there's plenty of televisions showing your favorite teams.,2
"What the heck do they do that makes their smoothies better than anyone's? Magic dust? Human catnip? Try the watermelon smoothie. Pure heaven. Tip when you enter, veer to the left to order, because they seem to get their entertainment standing around doing nothing, staring at you until the end of time while you wait for them to offer service.",2
"Green Iron Cleaners is one of my favorite non food shops in City Scape. Since I work just down the escalator from this dry cleaner, it's easy to bring in my jackets and ties and have them the next morning. The prices are very reasonable considering the convenience of not only being downtown but also in my office building.",2
"Again, this place exceeds it reputation and surpasses its reviews! Rebecca, you made the night worth writing about. Yes, you are the manager, but you managed to go above and beyond your duty. Jimbo was correct in his assessment of you and your staff. Kathy was the perfect mixologist, and I promise I won't ask for a hug prematurely! Next time, lol. I shall return.",2
"It has a great view of the Bellagio water show, if you sit outside. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara. It was yummy, but overpriced. After we ate dinner, we each thought it was good, but not worth the . Then, we discovered that there was a Groupon deal, the next day, for almost 50 off meals. We should have been smarter ",1
I come here for their beignets and nothing else so far. I still want to try their brioche but I know I need to give an hour's notice and I haven't gotten around to trying it. The beignets are definitely nothing compared to Downtown Disney's but where else am I going to get beignets in Vegas? Try out their other stuff !,2
"I have been twice for breakfast and the meals for both my friends and I were great! The service was very prompt and friendly. I have also gotten caramel iced coffee and the little box of treats to go, also very good. It is great to have a local little place that outshines the Starbucks across the parking lot.",2
We go there just about once a week. I really think it is the best value in Las Vegas. The food is always very consistent and the owner is behind the register 90 of the time. He knows his customers and really cares about customer service. nI see they are getting busier all the time. The word must be getting out about how great this restaurant is.,2
Absolutely love the HUB! Chris owner is always very friendly and makes sure to check on each table during their meal. Service is always impeccable and the food is amazing. I would highly recommend the HUB Club. It's an original twist on the club sandwich and will quickly become your new favorite meal. 5 stars from this family.,2
if i could give a negative star i would this has to be the worst Chinese food i have ever eaten. the S S pork and chicken were like rubber. The something beef was cut the wrong way so it was almost imposable to cut. I learned to clean my plate well not this time nor my wife PS. Chowmein was oily and no flavor,1
"in regards to the service department, Mark Ostaszewski is polite, friendly and prompt. I'm always personally greeted when I pull into the service bay. Mark listens to my concerns and then provides a loaner car. He contacts me by telephone with updates and to let me know when the car is ready. He has been my service adviser for a Z4 and X6M.",2
Way over priced. The roll I got was not even complete. The rice was not rolled all the way around. It had a gap at the bottom where everything could just fall out. I expected a lot more for the that the food costs here. I would have thought the quality and preperation of this Sushi Resturant would have been a lot better in a four star Hotel and Casino like the Golden Nugget.,1
"China A SlowSlow. If they were busy I would certainly cut them some slack, but the ""chef "" was busy messing with his iPhone, the woman behind the counter has zero people skills, and the food was bland. The prices? decent if the food had taste and came within an hour. My advice? Go in for lunch, order dinner, leave, come back. I will not be back.",1
"I have rarely met a pizza that I didn't like. And after reading reviews on AZCentral, and this being close to home, I figured this would be the place. I was seriously disappointed. I don't know if I just ordered the wrong thing, but this was pretty unimpressive. So much so that, even with it being one of the closest to home, we will never eat there again. Sorry guys!",1
"This place used to be one that I would look forward to visiting when I am on town. Unfortunately, when it is game day the food is mediocre at best and the service.well it is poor. Our server is no where to be found. Zipps should be called Zapps. When the crowd thins it doesn't get better. Next time I'll just go to Dukes.",1
Worst place ever! So disappointed and will never waste my time going back. How are you a brewery but are out of all your beers? Not only are you out of beers but half the menu was unavailable. The only thing available were frozen veggie burgers and really thin fried pork. Service was pretty bad too. I'll just stop there. Good luck to those who choose to go!,1
"Delicious! I've been to the one on Rainbow and 95 when it first opened. Fifth time visiting.So far so good, the nachos are BOMB! Lengua tacos are delicious. This place kind of reminds me of Roberto's excluding the oily part. nThe price is reasonable just like any taco shop. Small but clean! Also they have a drive thru so if your lazy hello drive thru!",2
This is the ONLY place to get Chicken Fried Steak! The portions are HUGE so bring your appetite. The pulled pork is good too! Just took some visiting friends this last week and it was delicious as always. They loved it. These guys are very consistent and the service is excellent! The have a cool little bar too. Not really for families. this is for the grown ups!,2
The first place I want to go to when I'm craving some good pho. Not even just any pho. oxtail and lobster pho for very reasonable prices! The oysters and pork belly are also amazing. nI also love how spacious and clean the restaurant is. District is now my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas!,2
"We order delivery from NAK approximately once a week. It is always consistently good. Our favorites are the sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, general Tao chicken and the lomein. Whenever I am sick, they make me a ""special "" soup which is the egg drop with wonton. There is something about that soup that has healing qualities! The food is always fresh and the delivery guys are great!",2
I left very unhappy with my pedicure. The customer service was just not good. The guy doing my pedicure started painting my toes the wrong color and then seemed annoyed when I told him that he grabbed my neighbors color by mistake. The bottom line is that I didn't feel comfortable or welcome or relaxed and I left unhappy with the final product. Not going back.,1
"First off, I don't really care about ambiance, but this place is bad ass. Sushi was awesome. Fish was perfect. nDrinks were strong and great. nI wish this place were cheaper but when you go ""upscale sushi "", it's going to be on the expensive tip. Service could have been a little better, but it was acceptable",2
"It's nice how friendly the staff is at first, but it's only to gather gossip about you. Stick around that front office long enough and you'll know everything there is to know about everyone. There's no privacy there in that regards! The staff does a 1 2 ass job picking up trash and dog feces. They will let any loser live here! Minimal credit check. Everything can be fudged. Greasy Palms much? SAD!",1
My wife have been there many times. The food just keeps getting worse. We had steaks tonight one was okay but the other was 80 fat and gristle. The part I was able to cut out was was so tough I could not eat it. The salad was old and bitter. There is no pride in there food anymore. We will never go back for lunch or dinner.,1
"I'm not sure why everyone loves this place. Maybe it's the gigantic portions of meat they serve. I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menu.oh wait, there's not one.and no, I don't like oatmeal or f ing grapefruit for breakfast. ick. I've waited in line once that'll be enough for me, Matt.",1
"Food is awesome, portions are absurdly huge, and the service is usually on point. That said, this is my go to spot for a 1pm breakfast after a serious Vegas hangover, the only complaint I have is that the music is obnoxiously loud and has a nasty effect of intensifying the hangover.still worth a 5 star though. Definitely worth a visit if you've never checked it out!",2
"I'm a big fan of the food and menu offerings, however w o service. what is the point? We go to this Steiner's about 2 3 times a month and for the first time walked out after being neglected for 15 minutes. Not everyone is guilty. the spiky haired guys is a great server. The rest of the bunch needs a review course in customer service.",1
"I decided to give an update to Woo Che. Still lovin their BBQ selections, but I came to give an update since my last visit last week! So I decided to bring a friend there to eat for dinner. The dinner was still 16.99 per person, but one thing I did notice is that they added a new DYI Bi Bim Bap Station! Clever.",2
"I love Wendy's but will next time go to one of the other locations within the city when I get a craving for a frosty. The staff is a little harsh, my order was not right and the fries were cold. Text book failure. I might have gotten them at the wrong time so will try again and hopefully they will redeem themselves.",1
The 2013 Phoenix Zoo ZooLights was a tremendous event hosted with a Wizrd of Oz theme. It seems the number of lights may have doubled and the Talking Giraffe is still telling good jokes. This is an incredible venue for corporate events and the park is lit up to perfection. Thank you Katie for a great event!,2
Sooooo much fun! I played with my mom and dad. The staff.NOT so friendly. One of them seemed annoyed because my parents were asking her HOW they really played BINGO.BOOOOO. But for 15 for an hour's play. it was our money's worth. I find that playing on paper has more thrill than playing electronically.,2
"Food was alway okay. Figured I was eating heathy so it did need to be amazing. BUT I always enjoyed the ""low calorie "" cookies. Only 27c each, and tasted great. But they lied to us, THEY LIED TO US! They are 160 each. Almost 1000 for the pack of six vs 170. OMG. I will never go back to these scammers.",1
Not very helpful. I've been lied to by representatives at this location. They never answer my questions. I only liked one person he isn't always there. Props to the manager he actually makes his employees work when he's there and he was very nice when he helped me. I feel bad he's surrounded by such incompetent people.,1
Love this place! The ambiance says it all. My fav area is the pool area. Went there on a Friday night so the pool was closed but patrons were allowed to party outside and gamble. They had a few gambling tables set up for those who wanted a break from the dance floor or for those who don't care for the club scene but rather preferred to try their luck at the table.,2
"I went this place not too long after they opened. It's border line pretentious, but they have very good coffee to back up the attitude, so I'll let it slide. They have wifi, but only tall tables stools. They're still good to do some work from, but I usually find those tables a bit of a hassle when it's really busy.",2
"The place was clean, the service was great, the food was nothing to woohoo about. I have been there twice, the food is consistently the same bland and boring stuff. The salsa is just a step above Pace picante, the beans are not good, and the rice was the same. If you have never had 'good' Mexican food, then you will probably love this place.",1
"We had the best lunch today. the chelo kabab from Zeytoon Bistro brightened our rainy cloud day. The quality, portion size, and the price of the take out were awesome. nThank you Thank you Thank you Zaytoon Kabab Bistro. We wish you lots of success. We hope you will open one close to us in Thompson Peak and Pima soon.",2
"Rude staff. They don't turn anyone away, but then rush people through and provide substandard service. I was not happy with the manicure but when I expressed this to the owner, she just argued back, wanted to charge me again to fix the paint, and was terribly rude. Given, that there are nail salons in every strip mall, no need to put up with rudeness or sloppiness that happens here.",1
"Burgers were okay. I just wanted something fast cuz I was starving! My patty was overcooked and the cheese wasn't even really melted. I also got a salad which was good. The lettice was fresh, but it was huge for a garden salad. I wouldn't really come here again either. If you're gonna eat, I say stay away from anywhere in Imperial Palace!",1
Mediocre food at best. For breakfast meals you can get better quality for the same price at Ihop. Wish they had more combo meals. Their only breakfast combo that came with eggs and bacon or sausage was their biscuits and gravy. I ordered the waffles and had to order eggs and bacon as sides. They also do not have a kids' menu.,1
"I've been staying here for years, but they've recently taken a turn for the worse. Too bad. I dug the location, price, and pool, but. no more. The place is grimy and overcrowded. Yet, the thing that bothered me the most is that the pool was dirty and you can't bring beverages from the casino to the poolside.",1
"I am not a big fan of AMANDA owner and waitress , or Fuego Del Mar A.K.A. Fuego Tacos! nIf you are new in the area or just visiting, please watch out for this restaurant! I assure you this place will give you suspicions. nWhat's the point of having a groupon deal if the business does not welcome newcomers! Please please be careful yelpers. Just needed to repost here ",1
"This place is fantastic. They have excellent curries and noodle dishes. Actually, everything I have ever tried here is just mmmmm. I always start with their spring rolls and then usually get their Chiang Mai Noodles. It's a good idea to eat family style here so you can try everything! Best thai I've had outside of Thailand. Also be sure to bring a nice reisling to complement the spicy meal!",2
"Don't come here if you have curly hair! The hairdresser I had didn't have a clue how to cut it. For example, she used a razor which you're definitely supposed to do with curly hair . To be fair, she is getting her real estate license. Hopefully she leaves hair cutting soon and never returns. And let's all hope she is better at selling houses.",1
Very rude and unprofessional guy! Not willing to work out anything with the customer. Very short on the phone. I called for some appliance repair. Called back after almost a week and flat out said he was booked for over a week. He did not even offer to make an appointment after his busy time. Would not recommend this company to anyone.,1
"Always slow, always overloaded. I have flown through here many times, and normally it takes 40 60 minutes to get through security. That in itself makes this airport annoying enough. The slot machines are always funny, and there is a decent selection of food. This is the reason for the additional star.",1
"I came for the first time one week ago. My hair had layers of dark at home dye. After the first session, my color didn't seem right to me. Amanda made time to see me right away the next day. While the final hair didn't look exactly like the picture I brought, the final style and color fit my face and coloring perfectly. Better than what I had planned.",2
"Pretty bad. Wait staff nice and friendly but too bad for them the food they serve is barely edible. I had ""3 farm fresh egg omelet "" made with fake eggs. The hash browns tasted really awful like freezer burned. And the worst part? Double what you'd pay at a bob Evans. My advice is to grab a bagel and yogurt at the hotel, a cup of Starbucks and you'll come out way ahead.",1
"this restaurant has the best and freshest sushi i've ever had in my life. started with the japanese mushroom salad and then oysters which were so fresh, i've never tasted anything like them before, followed by sushi abalone, sweet shrimp, squid, toro, yellowtail and sea urchin. out of this world. i cannot wait to go back to vegas to dine here again! p.s. have the mochi for dessert!",2
"I don't know why I decided to give this place more chances. I came in tonight and got steak lettuce wraps, it was the special and recommended by staff. I have to say I am not impressed, I barely ate half of them. The meat does not even taste like steak and I was given 4 small pieces of lettuce, not worth 11.00. Now I am sure I will not be back.",1
"Food is unique. Combinations you'll probably never see anywhere else. ""Twisted farm food "" indeed. It's quite good. Portions are huge, so two people can fill up on an 18 entree. Only downside be prepared to wait. The place is big and busy, so service is slow. Also, the only other alternative for breakfast at the Rio is an expensive buffet.",2
"Blah! This location is horrible! I usually go to the one on Sahara and it is amazing! We were in the neighborhood of this location so decided to try it out since I thought it would be similar to their other one. I think it is the same owner, but they definitely do things different. Try the other location on Sahara and Durango, its great.",1
"My favorite Chinese food in the Valley. I have seen many posts about the service, but I know the Owners and they are great, warm people when you get to know them. The service style is very much in line with their traditional Chinese culture. Food is always top notch. I like Egg flower soup the salt pepper crusted crab is amazing. Fresh seafood, great fried rice! Love The Nee!",2
"Staff was nice but as for the food, not so much. Fried rice is really dry, the dessert is an assortment of fruits, and by the time I wanted to get dessert, everything was gone and was not replenished. The free water was not refilled, but the ice bucket was over flowing. nYou have to pay before eating which I found kind of strange for a sit down restaurant.",1
Best 2.00 you will ever spend. Walking in those houses is like going back in time. Lots of neat things to look at on your self guided tour. Other reviews already covered the stuff there. The yellow air raid siren was done on the History Channel show American Restoration. Took about 2 hours to look at it all. Was a nice 60 degree day. Staff is very friendly and eager to help.,2
"I had just finished speaking at a conference, and wanted a place to sit down for a meal. and found my way to San Marco, which, after reading Heat about Mario Batali , how could I do anything but sit down for a meal here. The service was fantastic, food was pretty darned good the pork belly ragu was yummy. but the vegetable antipasti were just amazing .",2
"Called from out of town, found them on Google.Very Pleased with the Service they offered. Helped us pick a plant based arrangement for a funeral. Got it delivered and was told it was very nice! Was able to do everything over the phone and their website was very helpful as well. Hate I had to use them, glad I did!",2
This place is a Joke ! Your better off trying to fix it yourself ! I had to bring my car back 3 times and they didn't want to give me a rental. They had my car for 6 weeks the first time and I've had my car back for a month now and having to take it back again ! What a joke ! Please take your car somewhere else .,1
"How can you not love this place. The food is unbelievable, staff is super friendly and the location is really nice and quiet. This place gets super packed during lunch hours though and it sucks that it's a small venue, but apart from that i have no problems with this place. I recommend the breakfast burrito, garden pasta and the smoked turkey and avocado sandwich",2
"Pretty nice Costco, the pizza is awesome! The store is clean. If you can get there DURING normal Monday Friday work hours, it's not so bad. But, if you shop there on weekends or after work hours it's a madhouse! The parking lot is small for a Costco, it's next to a mall so there high traffic all around. 5 stars of it weren't for the anxiety causing, shoulder to shoulder claustrophobia p",2
"Not impressed bagels were okay but eggs, sausage, etc came out of the microwave, smoothie was a cup if sugar with no real fruit, out of the bagel I wanted, coffee my dad wanted, creamer another customer wanted, and the place was filthy from kids destroying their food all over the place. Will not go back.",1
"Not a bad ride. It has a couple of good drops. But I give it one star because it is so not worth 14. And it is so rough and jerky that I did not want to ride it again even for half price. The seats and restraints that come down over your shoulders are hard as a rock. It was very uncomfortable. Not that I expect comfort in a roller coaster, but it should not give you a headache.",1
"The associates at this store are not the most attentive. I was waiting out front for a few minutes before I decided to yell back that I was out front. Had I not come in for someone else, I would have left without purchasing anything. At least my persistence paid off I was able to purchase two donuts for my friend and I. If only those donuts had been fresher.",1
Horrible! Drab dreary terrible service and sucky food. nHow this place has fallen.as we walk in we get greeted with everything is the same just different owner.this couldn't be more removed from the truth! Used to come as a family and enjoy good pizza nice atmosphere and friendly attentive service.ITS ALL GONE! Don't go!,1
I had a reading with Jasmine who was awesome! She confirmed for me a few things I needed to hear which in turn left me feeling more at peace. I will definitely be contacting her again wheeeding guidance and would recommend her to anyone needing tbe same. Their rates are very reasonable and so worth it.,2
"gotta love their chicken wings. Mmmmm! going to this hooters your going to have to wait in line, but no problem for me, probably be waiting for less than 20 min. The servers that we have been getting, have been attentive and nice. Get's kinda loud here, but's it's all in the fun of sports, drinking, and chicken wings! The original and spicy are my favorite.",2
"If you're in Gilbert and need a great place with great service and great prices, this is it. nSeriously, I mean, THIS is it. There aren't any other sports bars in Gilbert. Fortunately, this place is fantastic and the prices are VERY reasonable. Pool, Darts, Patio and the occasional performance by Magic Mark make this saloon your ""Must Stop Shop. """,2
"Probably some of the worst food I've ever paid for. I don't think they cook anything fresh. Had a turkey sandwich day 1 it was awful with horrid American cheese for ""cheddar "". I'm sure that robots could prepare better food than the precooked frozen slop that is served. Absolutely nothing is fresh except the garnish. Not worth the price. 2 stars for ambiance and service.",1
"I went in looking for good quality massage lotion.ummm.I ran out of there! It reminded me of a yard sale! There wasn't a lot of anything to choose from. A lot of the bottles looked previously opened or used? nI know its ""down town "" but COME ON! I don't want to feel like I'm being ripped off PRIOR to buying anything. Well, Dollar Tree has this place beat!",1
"People here are imbeciles. How hard is it to put the meat in the side individually wrapped instead of putting it in the sandwich? I'm not asking you build me a house. I have done it countless times at other places firehouse subs, subway, bambinis, port of subs, and many more . I'm never coming here again. EVER!",1
"This place is the one Walmart that I see sad employees, the lines get out of hand and the reg never smile or speak to you, and trying to get help finding something no one will ever help you they tell you to hold on while they ask someone and theever come back well this place isn't on my list anymore.",1
"Happy early birthday to me! p cute place great prices for teppanyaki! 50 off sushi everyday can't beat that! Me and my husband shared the filet mignon, chicken teriyaki, and shrimp! For about 30 dollars not bad at all. Of course we had a few drinks soo it cost a little more . I can't wait to go back!",2
"They kind of washed my truck. It sucked. The wash, the service all of it. There is some fat guy that looks like porky the pig who writes the wash tickets. He will throw a fit and call you a tightwad if you don't want to upgrade to the mega stupid expensive wash. Don't go here find a donation car wash or anything drive through a sprinkler this place is the worst!",1
well unfortunatly i fall asleep at every show and i fell asleep for about 5 minutes during this one. but man! this show was soooooo beautiful. the set is absolutely amazing! i love the moving props and there is so much detail and depth. this is the best show in vegas. classic and timeless. and man can the main girl sing ! ,2
My chicken tasted raw. It didn't look pink . I kept trying to strain my eyes to be sure. And the rice was also kind of cruncky like it wasn't finished cooking. Someone train the new guy how to do it properly cause it had been fine in the past. Internet worked good enough for me to leave this review.,1
As a shop owner in another part of the country I was introduced to this Aamco by their customer who lives close to me. We were able to make a minor adjustment and solve their problem. Now with a customer of mine in Las Vegas I am pleased to report they are cheerfully giving good service to my customer who has a concern while on vacation there.,2
"Stopped by to try a nice glass of wine paired with a cheese platter. The minute I walked to the hostess stand I was greeted with a smile and welcomed by many. The food was wonderful and the service was great! Music was not what I would expect for a relaxing evening and a bit loud. Over all, we had a great time.give it a try, but be patient as it is new and working out some kinks I'm sure!",2
"Amazing church both inside and out. The stained glass and carpentry as top notch. I only wish they let us know that we could not see the whole thing when we bought tickets because there was some sort of celebrity baptism going on in the back. With that, it almost feels more glitzy than churchy. But still very beautiful.",2
"Food was fairly cold, came here because my parents wanted to have those all you can eat crab which was completely unfresh, but what can you expect from a 10 dollar buffet? The only thing that was decently good was from the habachi grill and the 2.79 beer which was great but apart from that, server was meh. And the oyster was dry as well. 2 stars cause of the beer though.",1
"I never had such a good steak in my life! Took the USDA Center Cut Filet, the only thing to say Amazing! nService is very kind and helpful. Food is prepared fresh and is delicious. No objections! Next time I visit the states I won't miss to eat there or in another Outback Steakhouse . nBe sure to make a reservation if you go for dinner, or take a seat at the bar which is first come first serve.",2
"New update! Came back and lucky for me Yvonne was there again! She was so sweet to my baby boy while I shopped. New favorite thing fill you own COOKIE JAR! The normal number of cookies that fit in the jar is 45 but if u can fit more, then extra cookies for you! We were able to walk away with 57. Just sayin. Best deal in the store!",2
Tried the head taco and it was okay. Also ordered the nachos and really was disappointed. The lady who took my order wasn't very friendly and the lady who brought the food to the counter where I picked it up wasn't so cheerful either. They have a good salsa bar but it didnt look that fresh. Will not be returning.,1
"Not only is the food delicious and a good value, the customer service is excellent. I called ahead and asked if they would be able to bring it to my car since I was returning from the vet with my dog in the car. I did not want to leave her in the car on a hot Vegas afternoon. They were more than willing to do so. This will be a regular go to spot when I need a quick and yummy meal.",2
"Just saw Jack Johnson. Great performance! Paid 5 for a flat coke in a plastic bottle and then was not allowed to leave with it after the concert really don't know why I still had it with me, but really? OK venue OK sound staff sucks. Not the smartest bunch of folks Guess they don't care who they hire.",1
"i'm gonna be honest with ya, the food is alright. none fancy. average, it kinda broke my heart, when i asked one of the owners if this was the only soul food joint in madison, she replies "" reverend james just open one up on beld street, it's been slow here for 19 months. "" just to support a locally owned business, ill think ill stop here once every two weeks or so",1
"Thought I would try this restaurant with all of the great reviews posted by other Yelpers. I came here for lunch and left really disappointed. We had the kalbi appetizer, roast duck noodles, and won tooodles. The noodles were stuck together and the broth was bland. This restaurant is definitely not on my repeat list.",1
My family has been going to Reimels Dentistry for 3 years now and we love them! We've had positive experiences with a welcoming staff. They are really great about getting you treated if needed the same day as your cleaning so that you don't have to reschedule and come back. I'd highly recommend them.,2
"Have never gone wrong at graze live very close and frequent there, especially for their great happy hour. The only bummer but also slightly very fun thing is that they have a seasonal menu so when you have something amazing and almost everything is! it will pretty much likely be gone the next time you are gone. Definitely go .",2
"This is an update review. This place is always busy and even when they are not busy, they take forever to make the drinks. Another thing is they are always out of boba! How are you going to have a bubble tea business but always run out of boba?! I love their drinks but they really need to get their crap together!",1
"De tr u00e8s bonnes portions pour un prix correct, la bouffe est d u00e9licieuse! J'ai mang u00e9 la cuisse de poulet sur charbon de bois et c' u00e9tait succulent. Le vin se vend u00e0 la bouteille, u00e7a nous a cout u00e9 un gros 8 ! pour deux bouteilles de vin s u00e9par u00e9es u00e0 5. Un endroit simple, authentique et sans pr u00e9tention.

"Dr. Mitch is extremely personable and professional when address your health and treatment. The facility has an amazingly friendly staff and Candice's massages are the best I've had! How can you not check them out when they are currently offering free x ray, consult massage? Your body will be grateful, trust me!",2
"The food is good, just like the original. Specifically, I really enjoy the al pastor and the fried fish. And the carnitas. Bonus points to this new location for the atmosphere. It's hip, but it's still ""fast casual "" aaaand they have a full bar. Prices are very affordable 2.50 taco, complimentary beans, 5 for a good selection of drafts , foods good, it's in my neighborhood.I'll definitely be back.",2
"I have been a fan of Which Wich since they opened at Westgate in Glendale. I found one in La Porte Texas on a business trip, so i have some idea of what to expect. nThe new store on Bell road is by far the best staffed which equals fast service. I am working on trying all of the sandwiches, Elvis is the next on my list",2
"I was here last summer and had the ""Steak et Fromage "", the french take on a philly cheese steak sandwhich. It came with a little side of dipping sauce and the mixture was amazing. nI seriously crave it. nmy mouth is watering just thinking about it. in fact, I am going to vegas again and this is going to be my birthday meal!",2
"I took two old photos to have copies made. One would think photos would be put on photo paper, not something that would be considered flimsy typing paper. Since we are visiting here, I didn't have the time to go back and have this done correctly. Don't bother to go there to have photos copied, since the person I talked to on the phone couldn't grasp the meaning of photo paper.",1
"Gross. Just gross. I wanted to like this place, it came highly recommended by locals. But I cannot understand what they are all raving about. Greasy, slimy, overcooked, mess. One of the nastiest Mexican meals we've ever had and upset our stomachs for days. nThe local Taco Bell has better reviews than this place, which I thought was hysterical, but now can understand why.",1
Dr Ketchmark is amazing! He really cares and loves animals! When I was going through losing my dog he was there for me and he even gave me his personal cell number to call them at anytime! His knowledge caring and kindness made the process so much less painful. Now that I have a new job I will continue going to him because he is the best that I have ever known!,2
"Will never go back. When I asked for water was told no because ""we are out of water cups "".Styrofoam cups were on counter.offered to buy a cup for water. ""no.buy a bottle of water if you want water "". Spent 30.00 for two salads and some dalmas with water.there are so many other choices in the area why would I go back there for that kind of service and mediocre food too?",1
"What a great way to escape the normal life and act like you are somewhere else for a day. I swear you forget where you are once you find a cove and jump in the water. There are so many places to drop anchor and have a nice time. You can rent boats, eat on the lake, swim, ski, jetski, fish, scuba dive, etc. This place rocks.",2
"This place reminds me of home! Great beers, bottled and on tap, and the menu well at least the dessert menu is exactly what my grandma cooks for Sunday lunches. The chocolate bread and butter pudding is one of the best I've ever had, and I consider myself a connoisseur. It's got brandy in it. Ask for it with creme anglais and ice cream. ""Get in my belly """,2
"impossible to get a list of ingredients for this place, no one at store has one, and the corporate office does not return calls or emails. When the list of ingredients is not listed it is a major red flag and you have to wonder what is in the ingredients because it is not all natural like they state. be weary of this place bad customer service stemming from corporate",1
Scottsdale standards? Stay somewhere else and gamble here if you want. The pool is mediocre. The restaurant choices are not spectacular except Orange Sky i really felt like i was on a carnival cruise with all the alcohol fueled tattooed gents and stiletto heeled teeny boppers here. Save your money and gamble and stay somewhere else.,1
"I'm not sure where all of the glowing reviews are coming from but this shop wanted to charge me 400 to swap out my radiator, AND I HAD ALL OF THE PARTS! He said it would take 4 hours. That's 100 hour for a 45 minute job! When I complained about the rate the desk guy told me to ""do it myself then "". LOL! So I did. This place is a joke.",1
This was the worst meal we had on our trip to Las Vegas. The service stunk and the food was mediocre. Our waiter forgot about us and we had to ask somebody else for our re fills. Also a couple of orders were slightly messed up. Plus one star for the sweet potato tots. You can do a lot better on the Strip.,1
"We love Dim Sum! And this place did not disappoint! We got the red bean trio, the duck spring rolls, and the salmon shrimp asparagus dumplings! SO DELICIOUS! We could have eaten 4 plates of those duck spring rolls! The menu suggested getting three small plates and one large to share between two. OR 6 small plates. WE opted for the first idea. It was all delicious! We can't wait to go back again!",2
"Was looking for a place to take my in laws. After reading the reviews on Yelp, we decided to try it. Was a little apprehensive about the location, but looks can be deceiving. The place was amazing! Excellent service, food was delicious, and it was wrapped up in a very authentic atmosphere! My husband and I rarely go out for dinner and we've already gone back.",2
"Great location horrible front desk told us our room would ready it was not, rooms are dated. Cheap rates but rather they hire better staff that know what they are doing and pay more. Stayed else where on our second days as the staff again was rude, told us the room would be ready and was not, and the manager couldn't care less. Much better hotels in the area to be staying here.",1
"I'll start off by saying that this restaurant is pricey, but what restaurant along The Strip isn't? The breakfast is amazing, and at least it's really good food for the price you're paying. Also, our waitress was the nicest lady ever, she even gave us the Rewards discount, which I hope that most customers receive for a dollar off their meal.",2
Came here on my wedding day for a cut and a shave and Joe did me right! He took his time to make sure I was looking my best for the big day. Hot shave is worth every penny. My suggestion is always make an appointment if you plan on coming in. This place is busy and it's tough if you want to walk in.,2
"Burger perfection! BIG burger perfection! Split it with a friend or go when you're extremely hungry! Great shakes, too! Personally, I'm torn on ""Best Burger "" between this place and the Grind. nThey're different, which is good. Friendly staff and a clean, airy atmosphere add to the experience. It's pricey, but you get a heck of a burger for the buck!",2
"Extremely disappointed. Made reses months ago asking for a room with a view for my husbands birthday. We've never been to Vegas and this was his choice. Not only did they io way accommodate us, but the room we got backs up to a wall. I feel as if I'm in a dungeon. What's the point of asking for a view of the strip if they don't care.",1
"I've never been a fan of Hooters and this one didn't change my mind. Even my friend who is a huge Hooters fan, refuses to go back after this experience. It wasn't the service, the wings food just weren't good. And I kinda have to agree with Blairs husband about the ladies, sorry. This is not the hooters to go to.",1
"This is my favorite ""hero "" place of all time. Some like Subway's better, but the combination of bread, with their trademark sweet peppers make this the place for me. Try their Blimpie Best or Blimpie Super if you like cold cut subs, but their hot subs are just as good. I go here at least twice a month for lunch.",2
"Ocho Locos does not participate in Maricopa County Environmental Services Restaurant Ratings beware. Do NOT order a martini here. I asked for mine dirty and it arrived filthy! It tasted like 50 olive juice. Disgusting. The spinach enchiladas are truly stuffed with spinach, which is great. Tortillas chips are out of a bag. I've been here three times and service is lackadaisical.",1
"My rating goes down every time I come here. They make you wait forever and then push you out of the office as fast as possible. They don't seem to care much about you as an individual, they just sheep you in and out. I'm high risk now and I'm glad they referred me to dr shah. I wish dr shah was my primary because that office is so great!",1
"Karaoke, local music acts, drink and food specials and it's good stuff! . there's always something fun going on at Brass. Also, this is just one of the 4 bars in the Hennessey's complex. You can effectively bar hop without leaving the building! Look for all star bartenders Shiloh, Sandra, and Tommy for yummy drinks and good times upstairs.",2
"It's a small joint but comfortable. I was hesitant about having Greek food but once I read what was on the menu.those falafels were all mine! Tasty and held their crunch within the pita bread covered in sauce, along with lettuce, tomato and onions. This Bronx kid's been missing his NYC food variety so this was a welcomed treat. Yummy, yummy, Eddie Machete had food in his tummy!",2
"No one, I mean NO ONE does the thin crust pizza better that Oregano's. 'Tis a real shame this place is no where near my home on So Cal. Their sauce is the perfect amount of salty sweetness and the cheese blend they use is superb. I wouldn't mess around with those specialty pizzas they have on the menus because their classic traditional pizzas are top notch. Please come to So Cal, please .",2
"Lifesaver when your bosses are at the fancy Cosmo bar downstairs spending more money than your paycheck and you just want a few moments of cheesy, crusty goodness. NY style, thin crust pie with nothing but flavor that will make you say ""Holy Crap! "" Go there sober, go their drunk, just go there and enjoy this hidden but well worth the hunt spot. PSSsssst serving PBL beer LOL!",2
"This place introduced me to mole sauce and I am forever grateful! nThis restaurant is a little out of the way but worth the trip Van Horne and St. Urbain I used to live in Montreal and when I come back for a visit, I make sure to visit La Hacienda. The guac is amazing and while I haven't tried many things on the menu, based on their mole sauce.I'm sold.",2
"Well damn. My friend and I drove banzai style to Vegas in 8.5 hours from San Jose to see a John Legend show at the PALMS. We got in, napped, showered, bootylicioused up, ate dinner here and then saw an amazing show. Clubbed a bit and then slept until 2am and hit the road. But back to this restaurant great service, great, AMAZING views. Great menu. Fantastic people watching.",2
"Have ate there several times since my last review and the food has always been amazing. There have been a few minor customer service issues but able to overlook due to the quality of the food. Today though, I placed a delivery order and it took an hour and fifteen minutes to arrive and was mostly cold on arrival.",1
"I have had to bring my PS3 in twice once to replace the Blu ray player and now to replace the motherboard due to the ""Red Light Of Death "" The guys at Vegas Video Game Repair are very knowledgeable, they are quick with a great turn around time and don't sacrifice quality work. I would recommend them to anyone needing help with their game systems!",2
"I've wanted to go here for years, so 2013 I finally did it. It is a great, wide open atmosphere that is very energetic. The drink prices were very steep, 39 for a pitcher of Margaritias.OUCH! However, all of Vegas is expensive considering the hotel lobby bars charge 9 for a Corona. We got the Nachos and 3 grown men could not finish them, so the bang for the buck was good.",2
"It's totally normal that the first thing I did after moving to Madison and getting off my flight was to stop by this library and get a library card, right? RIGHT? I didn't have any of the necessary documentation to get a library card proof of address? I don't even know my address , but the staff here was nice enough to get me through the process anyway while cracking the best worst geek jokes .",2
"I'm not sure if it was the live music, the large party next to us or just the acoustics but this place is loud! The crowd was good, service was great the food was delicious. I had the crab artichoke appetizer and the Chicken Souvlaki wrap, both very good reasonably priced. But I would have enjoyed it much more if I didn't have to scream at the person sitting next to me in order for him to hear me.",2
"Extremely disappointing. Eggs and sausage were cold. Hash browns tasted like left over from day before with bitter aftertaste. Signature item fresh biscuit was stale, cold and lacked taste. Only saving grace was the Ethiopian coffee. French toast was huge portion and passable but not the best. nSpoke to waitstaff to provide feedback to kitchen.",1
"I am a big fan! Every experience is a good one here! I think the food is great, and the atmosphere is so warm and inviting. I see a lot of reviews talking about bad service, but I, myself, have never experienced that. If you go, order a black velvet with sliders and ask for Rachel. You'll love your trip",2
"I would not recommend this restaurant. not only is the food mediocre at best. THEY FAIL TO PAY THEIR VENDORS FOR SERVICES RENDERED. Repeated phone calls, emails and left messages not one returned message. you would think that the money they are saving by not paying their vendors they could put a little back in the decor.",1
"This place is great. The food is delicious, and practically free it's so inexpensive. They've got a lot of home brews which are great, and they do Monday night Football with giveaways and prizes. The only downside is that it can get pretty crowded. It's still the best restaurant around the Fremont area. Strongly recommended to get dinner at before a Fremont adventure.",2
The coffee here is bad. I was so underwhelmed with Crazy Mocha. I have only been here once and that was enough for me. With 21st Coffee and Tea only blocks away.I make the choice to just avoid this place. The coffee tastes burnt and I am not going to frequent a place for frozen beverages if they can't make a simple cup of coffee tasty. Crazy Mocha is so not worth my while.,1
This place is awesome. I don't try new places but I found a gem in The Sugar Factory. Chef Chris and Chef Alejandro really did a great job on my food. I'm highly critical of food expecially pasta because it's so easy to make. These guys outdid themselves. I'll be back soon for food and of course drinks. Thanks guys!,2
"Well, their award winning egg sandwich lives up to it's name. Deliciously served on toasted bread with cream cheese, egg, onion and bacon, with a side of fruit and oven roasted potatoes. It's outstanding. Their award for best wait staff? Meh, average, really. But the food, or what I've tried, is the real treasure here in this cute little diner. Still need to try those cupcakes!",2
"This place was really disappointing. We ordered a pound of ribs, a pork sandwich, and various sides. The meat was average and underwhelming. I was really not thrilled to spend 50 bucks here the quality was something I'd spend 20 bucks on at the most. I think they have the food priced to pay the bills it's not priced based on the quality.",1
"Should read review before going, felt have to come here to write review. Everything people comment is true. You are almost shocked by the vol for food and think that they must divided food in the kitchen for you. Can't understand how can you make a noodle at the price with that quality and quantity.",1
"If your staying at the Venetian, you have to check out Tao Beach.They make yummy strawberry mojitos and its the best when you chill by the poolside in the hot vegas day. At night this place turns into the 3rd floor of the Tao Nightclub.It gets overly crowded with all the drunken people, but I would still recommend it to be a great place to party ",2
"Too pricey for the level of the service they provide. The crepes are OK but are not worth waiting ""an hour "" for. we ordered 2 crepes and were told they would be ready in AN HOUR. We returned in 20 mins to check on our order and they had already boxed our crepes and they had become soggy and watery from being placed inside a to go box while very hot. Not impressed at all.",1
"I was really excited when I saw this place opening. Tokyo Joes was highly recommended by some friends in Colorado, where it originated. I was a tad disappointed. I had teriyaki chicken and it reminded me a bit of Kyoto Bowl. Which was not what I was expecting. It wasn't terrible, I just thought it would be different.",1
"The truth is we went there because I bought my self a 50 discount coupons from tix4onight. But oh boy, the pasta is the finest I had in Vegas. You can have better pasta at Mario Batali's rest but for quadruple the price. The vodka pink sauce is amazing. The tortellini with cheese is amazing too. We also had veal Milanese and it was good. I would come back anytime if I crave pasta.",2
" mga kababayan ko, dapat lang malamayo, bilib ako sa kulay ko ako ay.pilipino n o di va? an sarap naman! tapos gusto ko yun kapeterya style na turo turo! n may handang tumulong sa yo at kumuha ng order mo, walang mabagal na hintay n an daming pagpipilian, as in super n buti di ako nakatira sa las begas, siguro tataas cholesterol ko dito n MURA NA MASARAP PA! TSIBUGAN NA, TAGAY PA!",2
"The hard rock is a decent place to stay. The rooms are clean and spacious. The staff are nice and helpful. The casino isn't the best. I thought it would be a bigger casino , but it's pretty small compared to mot of the other casinos in Vegas. Also very limited selection in electronic games. I wish that they had more variety. Overall it was a good experience.",2
Such a wonderful relaxing evening. They have a nice little waiting room with champagne and different teas. My massage therapist was very quiet which was great because I just wanted to close my eyes and not think. I had the deep tissue could have used a bit more pressure but it was basically perfect. Highly recommend!,2
"This not only is some of the worst pizza I've ever had, but it's also horrible service! I can't say I've ever disliked much pizza but the elementary cafeteria served better pizza than this! Also they charge extra for Parmesan cheese which is ridiculous. Their extra toppings are about 3X as much as other places. Workers were rude. I would never eat here again.",1
We just moved here and I needed to find a vet ASAP. Based in the other reviews I called and saw Dr. Wolf within an hour. My dog ended up having pancreatitis and stayed there for 2 nights. I can't express how grateful I am to find such a caring vet for my pup. Dr. Wolf and the staff are all amazing. Thank you so much for everything you did for Amaretto. I would give them 10 stars if I could.,2
Selberg was as advertised. Bryan did a quick re wire job In my garage and fixed a long time small electrical Issue ive had. Bryan was probably the most friendly contractor Ive ever met and far exceeded my expectations in all areas of my transaction with his business. Now I see why Selberg had an amazing reputation. Highly recommended if you need a dependable electrician.,2
"We found a sawed off bottom of a soda can with burn marks and white residue on it in the closet. We also found mouse feces. We didn't get attacked, which is important to say, because the negatives should be balanced by at least one positive. Owner was nice enough, and at 45, it was the cheapest last minute option. The lesson make prior arrangements elsewhere for the love of god.",1
"I was very disappointed in your business this morning. I had a rock chip in my windshield that I needed repaired. I went to Store 18 in West Valley Phoenix and they said there glass guy was a store 35, 5 minutes away. When I went to Store 35, they said the glass guy was not their. Thank you very much for wasting my time on my morning off. I will not be a customer at any of your locations again.",1
"Over priced small portions served in a long dark minimalist room looks like they ran out of money before they even thought about decorating , located in a warren of small buildings on a deserted city lot. Been there twice and maybe it was off hours but place was almost empty and service was barely serviceable. Original chef recently jumped ship. If you're smart, you won't even board. Abysmal.",1
"I usually go to the Coffee Rush in Gilbert Mesa, so I was happy to find out that this location is right next to another business I frequent. The owners are one of the best part of the Coffee Rush experience however, I love grabbing a cup of coffee, sitting by the lake and watching the ducks sunrise. If you love European style coffee. then look no further!",2
"A hidden treasure in this big shopping center. The falafel here is fresh and tastier than we have had in Manhattan, Studio City and London. Salads are very good and made to order. The atmosphere is very relaxed and nice the service is quick with sharp and attentive wait staff. V consistent. 5 stars all the way!",2
"Trip to Hash House A Go Go always end up with happy tummy and smiles. The portions are huge and very satisfying from all angles. Presentation, taste, staff, all combined will result in happy returning customers. Way to go! nWish they have daily specials that are withiormal lunch budget . Maybe it's something they can add in the future. 10 range including drinks at smaller portion plate .",2
"The staff is awful, they don't take credit cards, you have to order different menu items from different counters, refills cost extra. The food was average, nothing to write home about. The only reason they are still in business is because they are a novelty, and the appeal to drunk college kids for late night food.",1
I usually have a Teriyaki or sweet and sour chicken bowl. The price is good and the food is even better. I've been going to Blue Fin since 2005. The personable and quick customer service makes the experience all the better. It's easily accessible by the lightrail and north from the Central Library. Love this place.,2
"The jewelry is beautiful and priced great, however, the service was horrible. The two girls there barely eveoticed me in the store, let alone any of their other customers. When I picked out my purchase they seemed less than excited to be getting my money. Then after bagging my item one girl pretty much threw it at me. I'd rather pay a little extra not have to encounter this type of service again.",1
"customer service wasn't the best. they didn't write names on any of the cups, a lot of the customers were confused. I went inside to order because the drive thru was packed, i guess this location can get pretty packed, especially during a ""happy hour "" promotion. they didn't have any marble pound cake, but the cake pops are really good.",1
"I could not believe they don't have Coconut Cream Frappuccino, I literally ordered that last summer many times. This time, the barista gave me a perplex look saying that they never serve that stuff. Alright, it's cool. I took the recommended Vanilla Bean instead, and it was just TOO sweet, unbearable. The place is messy and very noisy, not the best Starbucks I've had.",1
"Took my car here twice, never again. They tried to ""repair "" the cracks in my windshield when they already repaired them the first time I was there. They kept trying to get me to do it again. Took a really long time to dry it when I got into my car, they took all my change in the small compartment. Really!?! Glad I took out other valuable items. Don't go here.",1
"I was just told that they do not want my money. I asked for extra services and none of them were completed. Kind of silly that I was willing to pay their prices with no questions asked and they couldn't be bothered to do the work as request. Also, no one at any location knows how to ring up gift cards.",1
"Real deal Neapolitan pizza, the wood fired oven looks great! 6.35 for a basic margherita pizza that has good char, some smokey flavor in the chewy dough, a great basic tomato sauce its a winner! If the pizza bottom was just a tad bit more crispy, it would be gold. Nice soda selections, perfect place to relax after a stroll in the Point.",2
"Don't waste your time or money! I have spent thousands of dollars there and got no relief. Very poor customer service and even worse results. They are very good at taking your money and your insurance, but terrible at providing results! I could not be more disappointed. I actually have more pain after being treated there!",1
"Of the sandwich shops out there Firehouse is one of the better IMO. from the meats to the bread the flavor is always well represented at all of the locations. This place seem to stay pretty busy and finding a table was almost an issue. We were lucky to get one just before the place hit the lunch rush. If you haven't been there yet, give Firehouse Subs a try.",2
"My favorite restaurant in all of the Greater Phoenix area, I have no idea how many times I have been here. Their Pho is the best I have ever had including the San Francisco Area . Their service is amazing, and they take the time to answer your questions and explain the menu. The name explains exactly what this restaurant is, unPhogettable.",2
"I've visited several times for both breakfast and lunch. They strive to have a homey feel, but the fake wood floors just make the place overly noisey. The staff is very nice. The food always reminds me of what I make myself when I'm in a hurry, rushing out the door. Overall, I don't enjoy the place very much.",1
"Weird service experience. I was served order of 3 sushi rolls and was given a fork as only utensil huh? . After eating, realized waitress had never bothered to bring my drink. Also she did not bother to ever return and bring the check, so I left money on the table. Sushi was fine. Floor covered in tremendous amounts of snow salt, seriously needed mopped.",1
"Yikes. Came to this place on a very slow Sunday. The service was friendly but very scatterbrained, the decor was falling apart, and I found two flies in my meal one was small and climbing in and out of my pita while the other was very large and very dead at the bottom of my salad. Thanks but no thanks.",1
"My family and I eat here every now and then, but have enjoyed consistently good food and service. The restaurant is clean and staff is attentive and efficient. Portions are nice and taste great. If you go for lunch, as for the frequent diner card and get a ""punch "" towards a free meal. There's something for everyone at Famous Dave's. Will definitely return in the future.",2
"If you go to a Gyros restraunt you dont order anything else! That said, Gus managed Parthenons on State St for 100 or so years before breaking out on his own. He was the back bone of Parthenons and shows it with his extrodinary recipes for the best Gyros I have ever had. If its sit down you want drive to the location in Cross Plains, it also have some of the best Mirco brews available!",2
Very disappointed. This restaurant has done a nose dive in the past few years. Tonight I tried to order chicken fingers and they couldn't figure out how to cook them. So I had to order something else. Nachos were a safe bet right? Wrong the cheese whiz nachos were horrible. I won't be coming back here again.,1
Excellent food. My wife had the clam chowder and it was fantastic. The Mexicali shrimp cocktail was amazing. The ahi tuna tacos were very good and so were the grouper tacos. My wife had the sangria and it was great. They make it homemade and its not that sweet. Its a small place in old town Gilbert and it has a patio. The owner is cool. A must if you are in the area.,2
"Let me first say, I am not a dog person. Went to a dog birthday party here and it was very cute. Dog pawty invitation, yappitizers, cake and biscuits. There is a back penned area for the dog guests to play in and the humans get to shop in the slighty overpriced store. Good morning America had this store as a segment on its show.",2
I love love love Iron Chef! The place itself is small but spacious and decorated very nicely. The staff are all very polite and attentive. The quality of the food is amazing and the happy hour prices are unbelieveably cheap. It's a great atmosphere and I consider this my favorite sushi joint in town ,2
"I love Petco! I left Petsmart and never looked back. Prices are reasonable, they have more of a variety of different treats. Plus, they're the only ones that carry my pups brand of food. Cashier is always friendly but it's hard to find any other employees in the store. I signed up for their rewards program and get about 10.00 off every so often.",2
This was my first time ever at a drive in movie theatre. I really enjoyed my time here with my gf. We were on a nice lil date. We watched the movie Oz the great and powerful. I don't know if it was the movie that was good or the atmosphere. Or the pure fact that we were chillin in a car with our chairs reclined. I wanna go here again. haha.,2
"This place is horrible. The lady at the front desk was extremely rude. I called for extra towels and the lady at the front desk informed me that she was too busy to get us towels. She went on to explain that she could not help us, said shed see what she could do and in the same breath said never mind I can't do anything for you. Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Shitty service and shitty staff.",1
"Small casino, no table games, only slots. There are girls dressed up in mardi gras outfits handing out beads out front with a ticket. They call ticket numbers every 30 minutes for a chance to spin a big slot machine. The best thing about this place is their fried foods. 2.50 for some bomb chili cheese fires 3 fried oreos for 0.99!",2
"Menchies is not my favorite fro yo shop in Charlotte, but it's a close second. To me, Yoforia's fro yo tastes better, but Menchie's has more flavors and toppings to choose from. The prepacks are also a good deal to take home and munch on. I would definitely recommend getting the smiley card.Ive already gotten three free servings by using it.",2
"Place is awesome, Bartenders real nice. DJ's suck. We have patronized all the goth bars in town for years and DJ's are getting so bad with music. I used to love this place, now I don't think we will ever go back. shame too, because all other bars clubs are closed down. We need a better scene and better DJ's!",1
"Although the shop seems great, once you are away from the shops and need help, their central customer service department are terrible. Also never use their online services, I bought a pair of shoes on sale and they refused to send them, refused to offer a like product and basically told me to get lost. I won't use them again. Good high street stores though.",1
"This place put the dirt in dirtbag. I hate saying bad things about a place but this bar captures all of the bad things about Tijuana not Mexico, but the complicated border town with high crime and low American morals . The drinks are OK. This place caters to a younger uncultured crowd. I think I was just too old to be there and I'm in my mid thirties.",1
"OMG PAUL IS AMAZING! nJust go see him and you will love him and the way you look. nHe did the Brazilian Blowout and in record time, fast, and looks amazing! Now I'm a photographer and have worked with many stylists but Paul's the real deal! He really impressed me BIG time. nThanks Paul and can't wait to see you again soon!",2
"I have bulging discs in my lower back and this workout doesn't usually aggravate them. Classes are a combination of cardio and strength. Great workout. Great location. It's expensive though and some teachers are definitely better than others. I always appreciate being corrected on my form, which not everyone does.",2
Sign outside says rated best dim sum in 2010. Well alot must have changed in 3 years. I would highly disagree.lol I was sub par at best with lack of flavor and cooking time of certain dishes that need to be cooked longer for the meats tendons and or other organs to property become consistance of how the traditional dim sum dish is suppose to be. The service was a bit lacking as well,1
"This is the 4th time we've been here. Since we're from San Diego, we only get to come a few times a year. This is absolutely the best barbecue we have ever had. The only hard thing is having to eat outside during the summer weather in vegas, but it is so worth it. Love the food the service is very friendly. Recommend it.",2
"Clean rooms, great amenities, safe place to party on the weekends and easy access from the freeway. The spa The best facial you could get is the 80 min Top of the Rock! I love relaxing in the steam room before my facial. They sell Hylunia products which I use. Locals usually get 20 off. Good customer service.",2
"Wish they had more stars to put. Love Love this place. Probably one of my fav. places in the valley. I'd like to go for weekend brunch , sometimes during lunch too., even though this place is far for me It has variety of veggie options. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for food items fresh in season.",2
"I love this one because it is after all the closest one to my house. I just wish that getting a seat was faster, so alot of times we order from home and take it home to eat. That can cause a little confusion though because the register up front never seems to have change. But overall very friendly people.",2
This is the best dental office I've ever been to. The level of detail and explanation that they give you is excellent. They show you photos and X rays over time on monitors and really take the time to explain every detail of your dental health. They are friendly and have the best technology available. I couldn't recommend them more highly.,2
Ice cream was typical for DQ but neighborhood was a bit sketchy on a Saturday evening. A guy outside had a holstered firearm. Very small store. Very limited seating. My only concern was how well they cleaned the Blizzard machine. Just looked like it needed some cleaning. No one got sick so probably fine too.,1
"Used these guys twice to rent a Uhaul for moving purposes. Had good experiences both times, however this past time I felt bullied to buy the insurance for the truck when I only drove it 2 miles. I ordered the truck online, and everything was ready and good to go the morning of. I would at least recommend using these guys for Uhaul rentals though I can't speak for storage rentals .",2
I have not liked going to fresh and easy as much since they changed companies. I never get any of their ads in the mail and when I try to check online it's not there either. The couple of times I did get an ad in the mail they didn't have the coupons in it! They also got rid of their clearance section that I loved. I hope that it's just due to a slow transition.,1
"I just went in to get my eyebrows waxed, and was not impressed. nThe woman who worked with me never introduced herself seemed rushed and like she would rather be anywhere else. nShe missed a few spots, and set my eyebrows a little too far apart thankfully they will grow back . I tried this place because of the convenience, but I think I'll stick to threading or my waxing place back home.",1
"I got a taro boba. I didn't know they used real taro. it gave my drink a grainy and starchy quality to it. wasn't a huge fan. I mean, cool to have real taro, but not if you're going to make my drink like potato pancake dough. also got some dried preserved cherries. they were ok. not the best I've had, but not bad.",1
"If you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy a standard drink, Hofbrauhaus is NOT the place for you. I mean this place gets loud! You'll quickly see the crowd standing on their seats, singing and dancing along to the music and enjoying Hof's home brew. Their lager is good, but I think I prefer their dunkel! Remember, your choice is 1 2 or full liter, so come prepared to drink!",2
would you believe that this was my second visit to this restaurant in the last several months and was served the wrong entree both times? The service was slow to begin with and then I had to wait again for the correct entree. When the correct food came it was just OK. Everything was pretty tasteless. We will not return.,1
"I love this place it is very chill and great place to be on a warm summer night. Parking is kind of a pain but there are other places you can park and walk over, if you cant find any in there lot. The waitress's are a little slow but it is busy so I can understand, just order your drinks before you run out.",2
Service varies. I've found that the waiters that work The tables outside are More friendly. Jambalaya with jasmine rice and the macaroni and cheese not your average mac and cheese theirs has bacon chicken different cheeses and spices added to it to make it gourmet are my two Faves. Timmermans strawberry beer is yummy. Or else I go for My usual blue moon with an orange.,2
"I'm a hardcore knitter, and whoever was working behind the register, it was a man, couldn't have been bothered with customers that day. Didn't say hello, didn't ask if i needed help or even acknowledge my existence. When I walked out and said, oh, well thanks, have a great day I didn't even hear anything back. so sad.",1
"I would not recommend this ""Bdubz "". Took us 10 mins to even get asked if we would like a drink. Then we get moved to 3 different tables and were highly disrespected. Ordered food and it was thrown on the table and they walked away. This is a place that I would expect to have avg customer service. There lucky I even paid the bill.",1
"An average place to have a beer and sandwich. Pricing for food was fair, but beer prices were a bit steep. We had a large group and service was great. I had the French Dip with fries. It had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served. If you're in the area I wouldn't avoid Sammy's, but I certainly would not go out of my way to get there.",1
We have been taking our two Weimaraners to Dogs All Day since we moved to Charlotte 2 years ago. We use both daycare boarding and have recommended Dogs all Day to many of our friends. Both of our dogs get so excited when we pull in and are so tired when we pick them up to go home. The staff is always friendly and they seem to really love dogs.,2
"We got the Classic Hot Fudge Sundae with vanilla and mint chocolate chip. The ice cream was way too rich, the price was way too high, and the service was terrible. nThe manager even told us we weren't allowed to sit inside because there's a long line of people waiting outside to get seated but no one was outside and the restaurant was deserted. And they turned off the fans outside.",1
Went for a late night meal. Decided to check out the new SLS hotel and tried Griddle Cafe. The Pancake Boozy Shake was incredible I had the Golden Ticket. I also had the Eggs Benidict. Instead of using English muffins they used potato skins. Yummy! I will be back to try the pancakes next time and get another boozy shake.,2
"Out of the big three pizza places, Domino's is always the last I would choose. I find thier based stodgy, the toppings greasy and also I think they are bloody expensive compared to Papa Johns or Pizza Hut. They take forever to make and deliver, and the staff never seem to be happy. If you do find you have to go to Domino's, go on tuesdays when the deals may save you some money.",1
Waited an hour as a new patient even when told to come 30 minutes early. About three women were taken back before me. Every station or room I went I waited even longer. And not only that but the nurses were condescending and also a little strange. By the time I saw Dr. Gatlin it had been two hours since I arrived. As a new patient is this how you want me to remember your office?,1
Being a Mexican food lover i must say that Tacos y Tortas El Panzon has given me to opportunity to try some of the most delicious and authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. I was very impressed by their salsas and the quality of their customer service. I will definitely recommend their food and i must say they have the BEST tacos in ALL Las Vegas!,2
"The food not bad really! But for the price O MY! I can understand that Arizona not near any ocean so seafood can be expensive, but how about corn and potatoes? I only got one half of corn in a bag and it cost me 75 cents half corn. Really? I love seafood but with the money that I pay here it's just not worth it. Only going come here when I really super crave for seafood.",1
"I had a great experience there, the brunch menu. Amazing! Good scenery, friendly staff, and food was delicious. I literally ordered seconds last Sunday. The owners were there making sure guests were taken care of which I always appreciate. I would definitely recommend this local spot to all my friends. nCheers!",2
"My second and third times to this place really let me down. Service was non existent and the food was poor compared to our fist experience. I know this is on the water, but I really didn't appreciate people coming in with no shirts men and no shoes. What a shame, this could be a real gold mine. We'll go back just to have a beer and watch the boats.",1
"So its been an hour and 30mins and just got a phone call trying to verify my address, im guessing the drivers lost. Not sure how you have delivery drivers who cant deliver to your address. Last time I order from here. Really Disappointed UPDATE FOOD CAME AT 1hour 40mins and food was cold. Thanks for making me burn 25.",1
Heard a lot of hooplah about this place so i decided to check it out. Ordered the cheesesteak and capistrami. The cheesesteak was just ok for me. Good amount of meat and cheese the capristrami was excellent. The slaw matched well with the perfectly seasoned pastrami. It was worth the visit. Next time ill try the Bobbie.,2
"FAST, PROFESSIONAL AND VERY ECONOMICAL! Out of the 7 electricians I had called, White Sands Electric Rick was the only one who returned my call on a timely manner and got the job done within the same day. I am so pleased with his professionalism and fast service. I highly recommend him! Great job Rick!",2
"Treated like a sub human and will not diverge any details due to retaliation from property management. If you want the details, I will let you know in private PM. If your identity cannot be verified or you seem to have a new account, due to fear of property management retaliation, I will not share the details of the incidents.",1
Came here because I had received a gift card. Glad I had it because I wouldn't have spent my own money on it. It was like a broke ass Yogurtland. Most of there flavors taste like cough medicine. I would never come here again. Oh and the people who work here are far from friendly.Bad costumer service.,1
"Had the best latte I've had in a very long time here. Late night 6ish , woman barista with darker hair, this last sunday she made it. Give that woman a raise! She was extremely nice and is very talented at what she does. Also, the orange and chocolate biscotti was to die for. Good job, Lola's. I'll be back!",2
We were there on a cloudy and cold memorial day weekend. We showd up around 2 and the place was packed with the most beautiful people in Vegas! I mean these girls were all HOT and the guys all tanned and buff. We saw that the wait was a 3 hour wait and decided to come back another day.looked like a great time!,2
Tried calling to order a to go order and was on hold for five minutes. Then the picks up and asks for my order I tell her the first item I want and she puts me on hold again. They either need to hire a more staff or just put another person on the phones. As far as how the pizza taste don't know went somewhere else for my Togo order.,1
"3.75 Wings . Yummy Just a tad nPizza . Yummy! Drinks . they were OK. The carbonation was off on the Coke and the owner tested it and gave me a ""replacement "" . it ended up on the bill anyway. LOL Sports bar type feel. Nice tv, nice and clean. Servers were really good. Ask about the poker special thing they have. For a good player it can be fun.",2
"For a vegas club, this one has gone down the drain. I've gone a few times thinking that it would get better, but never did. The first time I went it was practically all men there. Other couple times I went and there was almost no one there. Music was, decent, but I would not recommend anyone waste their time off the strip at this club.",1
"I wasn't even that excited to try the margarita here, actually. But when I buy an 18 drink I expect some damn alcohol in it! What's the point in some nasty, sweet, fruity beverage that's a chore to drink when it doesn't even get you sloshed, which is what I assume is the only purpose behind the drink?",1
"The workers here are extremely friendly, and the inside is absolutely beautiful. There is also a playful statue of the famous smiley mascot for people to see and take pictures with it! Kids love smiley and so do I! They have so many great items on the menu to choose from that I have trouble deciding!",2
"Wish I could give zero stars. I took my car here because it is close to my house. My car was damaged when they were finished. I pointed it out right away and the person drying my car got a manager. The manager told me that it was impossible that the damage was from the car wash, and proceeded to tell me how someone right before me was complaining about the same type of damage! Unbelievable.",1
"Consistently great dining. Inventive, seasonal specials with a reliable menu of favorites. I can always count on a great meal, nicely crafted cocktails and desserts worth a splurge. Can we say fresh peach pie? Table 34's ambience is perfect after a tough day at the office. Soft lighting, smooth service and a nice local crowd. I need to remember this gem on Warm Springs and the 215.",2
"Since I wrote my initial review, I've been back several times for work meetings. I still avoid the metal clams underneath the check in desk, but they've converted me to a fan. The rooms are incredibly modern compared to other rooms on the strip. One of my preferred places to stay in Vegas! Great quality value for your money! The staff still say hi to you in the halls!",2
They give u large amounts of food but their is no flavor. They give you one plate of food that could very well feed four people at best. So you think I would be happy right but no I feel a lot of things but happiness is not one of those feelings. What good is a lot of food if its tasteless? nThe staff was nice the place was clean. Food flavorless. Will I return No.,1
".The waitress was a little ditsy but the sushi was good! The overall atmosphere on Saturday night was a little loud oMg, how OLD am I? It was hard to talk to our table of 8 but it would have been OK if it were just 2 4 people. We tried a LOT of different rolls and all of them were really good some we ordered 2x! Enjoy!",2
"Yep, still my favorite steakhouse in Vegas. Went here the other night and had a meltingly tender filet, a fabulous glass of pinot, crispy herbed fries, pretzel bread, 4 delicious sauces and roasted root vegetables. We were tired and would have loved quicker check service, but that 's our problem not theirs.",2
"What can we say, we love this Vegas chain of fun and deliciousness. And how excited we we're when they opened up their Westside location. Whether it's the terra y mare, empanadas or the blood orange mojitos best mojitos in town this place never disappoints. Excellent customer service, great atmosphere and good eats and drinks is a recipe for always a good time.",2
"kinda pretentious staff.the kind of, ""i know they started a convo about me as soon as I left "" vibe. Tthe food was pretty dang good.Happy Hour specials were pretty awesome as well.just kinda felt uncomfortable, as the wait staff were overly annoyed that people were using Groupons.I have to say Rare Earth just is not worth the drive.",1
"Un des pire service que je n'ai jamais eu ! Mauvaise gestion du service, plat in u00e9gaux 3 personnes ont command u00e9 le m u00eame plat et les portions ont u00e9t u00e9 tr u00e8s diff u00e9rentes de l'un u00e0 l'autre et prix exorbitant pour ce qu'on a eu comme portion. Ce fut une tr u00e8s mauvaise exp u00e9rience, j'ai gaspill u00e9 mon argent. Je vous conseille fortement d'aller ailleurs !",1
Our server was very polite but did not like the food. My dad ordered the corned beef hash with poached eggs and i had ordered the Reuben panini The meat in both meals was very chewy and the hash browns were not cooked all of the way. The poahed eggs were practically hard boiled eggs. We both did not finish our meals. I suggest to walk around a bit there are other restaurants on the property.,1
"Their staff is very friendly, and the food is consistently good. My favorite starter is the Garlic Butter Edamame. My favorite entree thus far is the Crispy Rice in Clay Pot with chicken, had it five times and enjoyed it every time. I also highly recommend the Garlic Noodles as a side dish to share with one person.",2
"So we came in for the date night special. We were seated right away. All I can say is it has been a great night! The food was perfect and the service was spot on! Our waitress Stephanie was prompt and although they looked very busy Stephanie's service was perfect. Thank Stephanie.! We will see you again on ""date night """,2
"Went for breakfast. Prices are very affordable and the food is ok. If I were to go back though it would be more to support an independent restaurant over a chain rather than for the food. On the plus side, the vegetables in the omelet were generous even if it wasn't the best omelet I've had for breakfast.",1
"This mall used to be really awesome years ago. A mall where you could hang out with your friends on a Saturday. But if you go there now on a Saturday, it is relatively dead. The only customers you see are usually high school thugs, pregnant teens, and crabby seniors. Most of the really cool stores are long gone and the mall always seems in danger of closing for good.",1
I ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein and Chicken with vegetables. The noodles were overly cooked in the LoMein and flavorless. The Chicken had a very odd taste. I called to complain and only received a refund on the Chicken and Vegetables. Whoever I spoke with was reluctant on refunding my . I will not be going back! Worst customer service!,1
"We went in for drinks and sweets. We were notified immediately that the kitchen closes at 10pm. OK, cool! 3 of us ordered drinks and I ordered sweets. They said the beers were OK. I ordered the warm donut holes, those suckers are good. Service was average. Us girls went to the restrooms and wow. It is gross. SO GROSS! I decided to wait until we got home and that is a 30 min drive .",1
"Wow was I proven wrong. After my initial post, the manager reached out to me. I was invited back on the house and have come back multiple times since. Not only did the initial waitress I had challenges with apologize, we have had stellar service experiences since. I have been blown away with the service recovery! I may have to make this my happy hour hot spot.",2
"If you plan on coming here, stick to the antipasta. Artichoke dip is fab. Service is decent. Main dishes were a severe disappointment and definitely not worth the higher price. Chicken penne was bland and overcooked, ciopinno was incredibly salty and the ravioli was plan and raw. Would only come back if it was the only place open. Save your money and your taste buds.",1
"What a let down! I went here Friday night for some after dinner drinks but the place so loud and hectic. I couldn't tell who was working there, no one greeted at us the door and the bar was to packed to even get the bartenders attention. The food was okay, I definitely wouldn't go there to eat dinner. This place obviously tried to copy Postinos but they have failed miserably.",1
"hallelujah there is some pork up here in the north kinda west valley! My favorite thing about this place is that you can buy the pork by the pound. I think it's about 14, which sounds a bit spendy, but it is worth it. The sandwiches are amazing. If you are in the area and want a hefty lunch you gotta go to Pork on a Fork!",2
Ate here early on a Sunday afternoon. My boyfriend and I sat in the bar. The bartender was extremely rude right off the bat. Service was horrible. I had to wait a long time for my bottomless mimosas every time I wanted a refill. I also ordered a burger and not only was it really small but it tasted pretty average. Nothing special about this place. Overpriced and not worth the time.,1
"Fun music and lots of people. Me and a friend were just talking to a security guard and a girl who didn't like my friend threw a drink at her and kicked her in the back. When we said ""are you gonna do anything ? "" He said ""I believe that was an accident. "" Left right after, I'm insulted and will never go here for lunch or a night out ever again.",1
"A solid four. No need to worry it's anything less. I'm impressed we have a place like this in the Val Vista Lakes area. Clean, modern, clean, good service, clean, good pad thai and clean. You always worry about that in a mom and pop. Very good lunch special. Spice scale is 1 10. I got a 3 and it was just enough for me. My sister got an 8 and was blown away and she likes spicey. Just a heads up.",2
"Inka Heritage did a wonderful job with my book release party. The space looked good, the food was tasty and plentiful, the staff was friendly, and the owners even cut me a deal on our agreed upon price after their success in drinks and new potential customers. I wish Daniel, Esmeralda and their staff continued success.",2
They fill this place in past max capacity where it literally is like walking on top of another person just to get anywhere. Even to get back in from outside you have to wait in another line because they have to wait for people to exit first. These people need to be more about customer service instead of money hungry thieves.,1
"This restaurant was highly recommended to me. I tried a combination plate, but was not impressed. I liked the beef, it was tender and flavorful. The chicken katsu was dry. The roll and macaroni salad was bland. But my biggest complaint was the teryaki sauce. It was watery and bitter. Maybe I am used to Aloha Specialities in the California Hotel, but I was not impressed.",1
I have used this location for my cars 3 4 times in the past 6 months since moving to Las Vegas. The new manager and his team have provided excellent customer service. They price matched on tires and were very competitive on oil changes when you use their coupons. They even put nitrogen in my tires at no charge even though I did not buy them there.,2
"This place is great. I showed up, without a reservation, looking for a very specific bike. They had one and started to prep it for me. Unfortunately, they found some mechanical issues with the bike, and rather than have me waiting around, they upgraded me for free. I will definitely use them the next time I'm in Vegas and will recommend them to my friends.",2
"I went into this place for the first time today. I almost gagged when I found out what the prices were. The selection is incredible. But the prices give you a bend over and grab your ankles feeling. But it's a free market, he can charge what he wants to. I'm not going to support this kind of exorbitant pricing.",1
"The hotel needs some updating to be a 5 star resort. However, the service was great. Willow Stream Spa was the best. You can practically spend your day at the spa with the Swiss showers, sauna, steam room, relaxation room, aerobics classes, and so much more. They also provide healthy and reasonably priced meals. It was so relaxing.",2
"So I usually am not a fan of chains, but I've been wanting to try this for a while. The service and the food rocked. Something that never happens has happened. My food looked like the pictures. It was good, fresh and fast. They actually walked table to table to make sure stuff was right. I'll be back for sure",2
"Avoid this location like the plague. I've gone here twice, and both times were awful. The most recent time, I waited in their drive through line for 15 minutes, just to get home and realize they gave me someone else's order. This place is ridiculous and I'm never going back.I would advise you to do the same.",1
"2 stars I've experienced better. The hotel itself is a ""3 star "" property though mostly listed as a 4 star . It has nothing onsite. You'll need to walk to the mall or regular PH Hotel for dinning or spa. The rooms are nice but feel rundown. Midrange beds and bedding, not top end. The hallways are hideous narrow and garish colors not hip gone wrong, just bad .",1
"Faith from We Luv Flowers did an amazing job with my wedding flowers. All my guests were at awe when they walked into the banquet room and so were we. Her team and herself went above and beyond for us and did exactly what we requested with our arrangements, even though we bought our own vases, crystals and led lights Faith put it all together for us.",2
I came in to get fitted into a suit for a wedding in Michigan. The entire staff was very friendly and made it a pretty simple process. They confirmed I would pick up the suit back in Detroit and gave me a 20 off coupon for a future purchase was nice. Hopefully everything is delivered well in a few weeks so I don't have to update my review ,2
"Relaxing place to unwind and have a nice glass of wine or an expertly made cocktail! We stopped in during happy hour and enjoyed their house white and red wine for 5.it was surprisingly good! We also shared an order of the smoked potato croquettes. They were delicious and very flavorful. Great atmosphere, great wine and cocktails and good service too!",2
"Employee said they were opening at 7am, then told another patron 7 30am and she was still inside with the lights dim and the gates closed at 7 45am. You would think they would be open at a set time or at least in comparison to everyone else in the airport at this time. Even the chocolate stores were open!",1
"For nightlife Westgate is about as good as it gets on this side of town and that's just not good enough! It feels like a shopping mall of corporate bars. Seriously, if you are visiting from out of town and you want to have some adult fun you MUST visit Old Town Scottsdale the best bars, clubs, restaurants, art and live entertainment. Please don't judge our beloved valley by the west side!",1
"At 85 dollars a night I expect my towels to be clean. Not with a mascara imprint of someone's face from before. When we first arrived here our key didn't work. Our room which was supposed to he an ""upgrade "" was less than glamorous. The sheets are already stained and the pillows are thin. The fridge barely works and the neighbors are have been having the tv on blast all night.",1
This is my only 1 star rating since using Yelp. We waited 20 mins to be seated that was no big deal. After we were seated we noticed that 3 families that came in after us were seated and had drinks and chips at their tables We had not even been greeted. Waitresses avoided our table handed out checks refilled glasses to other customers. I have never felt so disrespected.,1
This place is a total bummer. Brought my little sisters and friends here to jump and hang out. Turns out there are rules that are size segregated. Which left my little sister alone jumping with people she doesn't know. She got upset within the 5 minutes of jumping I knew the rules weren't going to change and got my money back. Quite disappointing.,1
"The best way to describe this place is ""ghetto "". The front office staff is ""ghetto "" all the way, the waiting room is filthy, the place is something you would expect in Tijuana. The only difference would be that the staff in Tijuana would be more polite and caring. Enough is enough. Demand better. This is at the Eastern location. I assume the others are just the same.",1
"The slighly cooler hot wax has continued to be a proven effective alternative to the hotter wax at other salons. With waxing regularly, my breakouts are very minimal with this wax. The staff remain extremely professional, and I feel comfortable enough to explore other waxing options. I am still very pleased that I started to go to EWC, and plan on continuing to as long as I live near one!",2
"Very friendly service and a nice selection at this restaurant supply store. This is a small business, so they don't have every kitchen item that you might want, but they have a lot of things, and commercial grade quality. I picked up a hefty polypropylene cutting board on my last visit. Vastly superior to the department store versions. Fair prices, too.",2
"A Vegas Classic. This place is like a mullet, business up front, party in the back. The front restaurant is pretty much a ""Denny's "" but the back has late night bar food, sunken booths with a fire pit and old school decor with neon lights and probably the original lights from 1980. So fun! The food is exactly what you would expect, bar food. Good quality but bar food nonetheless.",2
"When we first moved to Goodyear over a year ago my SO was worried he wouldn't be able to find a good barber shop but we hit the jackpot with Kim's. She's done his hair almost every time, and is amazing. My SO is a Marine vet and loves his high and tights and Kim does it right every time. We come back monthly and will until we no longer live in the area.",2
"I had the Amatriciana sauce with bucatini. The sauce was delicious, although I would've paired it with a different noodle. The fetuccini bolognese was delicious as always. Wait staff is very attentive, food was served io time. Malbec was tasty and paired well. Great live jazz and dim lights to provide a pleasant atmosphere.",2
"One of the first froyo places on Mill Ave. I like this place a lot. They have a good selection of yogurt flavors and toppings such as fresh fruit, candy and assorted nuts. It's better with a coupon because I like a lot of toppings and it can get expensive. Sometimes I find buy one get one free coupons, which make me ",2
Seems to be pretty typical of a mom and pop Chinese restaurant.Table in the corner that the owners' family sits at.their kids running around. nThis was my first time eating there. I opted for takeout. The chicken fried rice was really tasty and the chicken lo mein was also good. Looking forward to trying more of their menu.,2
The sales people on the floor are a tid bit pushy they assume because your looking eather you need to buy or leave. Everyone was nice so I can assume they were ready to go home after a long day. I wont return. I went down the street and got a full bedroom set so its their lost. Next time maybe they wont rush they clients.,2
The food is great. It is no wonder why this place is always packed. I would have to say that you would have to have a lot of time to eat here. You can't be in a rush or have any time constraints. It did take a while for the food to come out but it was great when it did. Our server checked on us throughtout dinner. I would definitely can me back.,2
Love the stuff but after purchasing several things at the Scottsdale store arranging to pick them up next week I went to the Gilbert store to buy more the same day. There was a lower price on 2 chairs I bought 200. in Scottsdale they wouldn't honor it. All sales FINAL! Very poor customer relations by the owner!,1
"Such a good show. All though it might lose you in the middle of the play overall it's one of the best shoes I've seen yet. They staff is very quick. They show is really good the little party after wards is the best, seeing everyone happy was such a good feeling. They do not allow you to take your phones out during the show. Have fun and enjoy te show. Best of the best",2
Came here for a to go order. I live in the area and was tired of the usual sandwich shops and bar food. I ordered the shumai and the spicy tuna roll. The Shumai were tiny think the frozen stuff you find at the grocery store . I wasn't all to impressed with the sushi either. It was ok for a quick fix but I probably won't be back. I'll gladly drive a few more minutes for better sushi.,1
Last night was the second time I have eaten here and it was just as amazing as the first time. Around Halloween they serve up a seasonal pumpkin lasagne that is delicious. Last night I had the lobster ravioli with creamy roasted red pepper sauce that was spectacular. We love the quaint atmosphere and that this is not some generic chain Italian place.,2
"It says they're open until midnight, so we went at 9 30 tonight. When we walked in the waiter told us they were on last call. Their hours are printed on the door, they are open from 4p CLOSED. They close at closed. What the fuck am I supposed to do with that? The bottle rockets are really good, one star for that.",1
"For dinner I've been here 3 times and was impressed each time. Great food. Reasonable prices. The servings are huge, so you definitely can split an entree. We sat on the outdoor patio at dusk last time we were there, which was a great spot. Definitely a great place for an intimate dinner or for groups. The service is great too. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Highly recommended.",2
"I've always really enjoyed this place. Their fish fry is SO good and is ""all you can eat. "" So many places with a good fish fry in the Madison area have a super long wait on a Friday night. I have never had to wait for a table at O'Grady's for longer than 10 minutes, and most of the time there's no wait at all. Definitely give this place a try!",2
"one of the best fish and chips in town with a choice of different fish and batter to choose from. cant go wrong with the cod, hake, tandoori shrimp and curry fish cake. wash it all down with a cold beer. portions are big if you decide to get the chips. if you want to sample, its best to share the chips",2
"I am disappointed by my visit to this restaurant. As a tequila drinker who loves Mexican food, I had high hopes. I was Initially insulted by our drinks. I ordered a Corzo on the rocks. The 1 oz serving which I was given was watered down by at least 50 and my husband's classic margarita was all mix. My tacos were overly salty, but the beans were very good.",1
"Go to Veritas if you like toasted white wonderbread and dry salty balls of meat. The microwaved French fries were amazing. If you're not into any of that, they have TWO other entree options, so don't worry! They haven't yet learned how to run a credit card so expect a call asking you to stop back in.",1
"For a unique lunch experience this is the place to be! Awesome mushroom bar. I had the portabello mushroom with eggplant. ""OMG Delicious "". The decor is very nice, bathrooms are very clean. The service was top notch. Affordable price, absolutely! If you heard of it and never tried Betty's Nosh get in there. What are you waiting for? Awarded Analynn's ",2
I went to Kabuki last night for a drink with 4 other friends and to get a little Sushi. Drinks took forever to get the waiter told me that I had to order a drink first instead of sushi really WTF. It was an hour for one order of drinks and two appetizers. We then had to go out of our way to get our bill. Great atmosphere good food Crappy staff.,1
"Villagio This place is so cool, it's almost too cool, but not quite. The perfect amount of cool. Cool cocktails but keep your sister away from the Berry Flirtinis or she might get thrown out of a taxi for being too drunk. Cool food also, modern pub stuff, nothing too extravagant and well priced. The music is pretty good also. Popular among the after work crowd but also a very busy late night spot.",2
"Ordered the Chicken Piccata which is supposed to come with the chicken, potatoes and fresh veggies. The veggies never made the plate. In addition, they don't have Jack Daniels apparently corporate decided not to carry it and to go with Jim Beam. Seriously, who doesn't have jack? The food is poor quality. It reminds me of a cracker barrel.",1
"I ordered the half sandwich and soup combo.so far so good. She took what I thought was a half sandwich and cut that in half! Oh boy, very small. I attached a picturet. Anyways, the soup was broccoli and cheese. That was pretty good. Total was 8 bucks. I'm not going back, I dont see what the hype is at this place besides it being at the airport.",1
"It has been five days since I left a voicemail for the General Manager of the hotel. He has not returned my call, nor did he reach out to me in any way. Just confirms my earlier assessment of this hotel MGM needs to retool this hotel and find out why so many customers complain about how its run. MGM are you listening?",1
"I don't understand how this buffet has such a good reputation. The food was mediocre to good. For the price, I'd HAPPILY pay 10 more and go to the Aria and have lobster or prime rib that isn't dry. This place feels like they are just cramming mass amounts of food down your throat sacrificing quality. You may as well go to the Excalibur and save 20 if that is what you are looking for.",1
"Pros convenient location, free shuttle to Manday, free internet , free breakfast, in room coffee. Cons. Small room, thin walls could hear the neighbors every word on their phone, and they weren't yelling rubbery eggs at breakfast, noisy room air conditioner . You have to chose what's important to you. I'll pass on this property next time.",1
This is probably a nice late night bar but the food was terrible. There is pub food and there is frozen pub food which I am sure we ate. I am sorry I passed by Hooters. I met Jr. next day and If I knew him better I would have told him to get new kitchen staff. I hope management takes note and makes changes.,1
We went with a group of 14 people. Nothing but friendliness. Imagine a restaurant in America where the waitress brings everyone water along with other drinks thats pretty cool. Velvet soup was recommended to us by friends and was great order a bowl and share with atleast 6 people. The Anthony's noodles and General Tso's chicken was superb. menu prizes are very very reasonable Don't miss this place,2
I want to give a shout out to Sam who works filling up balloons. She is an amazing and dedicated employee. I came in on Monday to get three balloons made for a photo shoot and she went above and beyond to help me create the look I was trying to achieve. Sam seriously spent a solid 30 minutes with me and was so kind. nI greatly appreciated this excellent customer service.,2
"Everytime I have com here. I absolutely love how clean and well kept the salon is. I am always asked if I would like anything to drink within the first 5 minutes of walking in, which is a great feeling. My nails stay for more than two weeks and I'm pleased with the color each and every time. I never seem to be dissapointed. Thank you so much Herbal nails.",2
"Not what we thought it would be. Menu needs to have explanations under the names. Very hard to understand what the dishes are. Our dinner was interrupted by a very large cockroach that I ended up killing. Manager made it sound like its no big deal. We actually stood up and left along with a few other couples. Warm inside, asked a few times if the could adjust the temp. We won't be going back.",1
I rarely give anyone a perfect score because I always think there is room for improvement but I have to admit that Dr Davis's office is near perfect. I just moved here from out of state and was nervous about finding a new dentist since I've had a lot of past dental work. Their staff is very nice and professional. Ann the hygienist was super nice and very good. Overall a very good experience.,2
"This Ross is fairly new and is not nearly as crowded as most Ross stores, so you don't have to wait 10 years in line to check out. The store is clean and the staff have always been very friendly. The only issue is that they are not as well stocked with merchandise as most other stores, but I am sure that will change over time.",2
"Went there for lunch today. Had a soup and salad, excellent. But I have to say our waiter was probably the best I have ever had in any restaurant. I mean ever. He was probably 30 or so, but he was phenomenal in all aspects of serving. Kudos to Brio, great hire! It is so nice when the food great and the wait staff if equally as great. Totally enjoyable lunch.",2
"Best Farmers Market in the world! Offerings range from soup to nuts, literally. The Hot Spicy Cheese Bread from Stella's Bakery is incredible. I always get an apple fritter from Farm Pride Bakery, out of Gays Mills. In general, all of the vendors are extremely nice and helpful. If you don't know how to use a particular fruit or vegetable, they will take the time to tell you how to best prepare it.",2
"Went with friends who had been there before. Food was great, prices reasonable, atmosphere wonderful but our server took the trophy home. Zach was attentive, cordial, even gave us recommendations that were right on. We will definitely come back time and again. Kudos to Zach for a wonderful evening and making us feel welcome. Keep up the good work.",2
"This place is a butcher shop. Arrogant, lazy staff that rushes to finish the job so they can get back to sitting or smoking out front. I know it's inexpensive but I thought you were getting the discount by compromising on ambiance, not quality. I'm 30 and it's probably been fifteen years since I had a hair experience worth crying about. Until this place got ahold of me, that is.",1
The coffee is decent. The cappuccino is really good! But I won't be back. We've been there a hand full of times and every time I have been there the barista same one has been on the unfriendly side. The first couple of times I thought maybe she was having a rough day. That's definitely not the case. She's just rude.,1
I totally agree with Jess Y. The guy in front of me got charged 1 for tap water. This starbucks had used drink cups everywhere. I dont get why people don't clean up after themselves. Needs to be cleaned. This starbucks wasnt cooperate so they didnt take my amazon local 20 off. For some reason the prices are higher for starbucks on the strip!,2
Un groupe de 36 personnes et toute les assiettes arrivent avec f u00e8ve verte et une tomate cerise. Frite molle servi avec ketchup et un cup de maillot. C'est n'importe quoi ! San parler de mon entr u00e9e . Pour le prix je n'y retournerai jamais le steak est san gout et tr u00e8s tr u00e8s ordinaire. Je ne recommande pas ce restaurant a personne.,1
"This place is extremely overpriced. The service was ok, but I don't understand how you can charge 14 for a PBR in a brown bag with a shot of Jack. That is criminal. I had the 18 buffalo burger which I could hardly taste because the bun was so gigantic and the fries tasted like had come out of a frozen bag. I will not go back to this PUB. There much better places to eat in Vegas.",1
"Simple, rustic decor, relaxed and easy atmosphere, great service. It's all about that smoked paprika sauce. Still, I'd give it a 3 based on ""just decent overall "" but the sweet bourbon Old Fashioned was Absolute Vintage Perfection. Could not have been better. I'm a sucker for a rustic cocktail in a place with wooden floors.",2
This place was my very first Thai experience 5 years ago and it was delicious! We had one of the curries and it was the perfect balance of flavors. This place is what turned me on to Thai food being my favorite food. The restaurant itself is nice and their Thai iced tea was yummy. I wish the hours were better though.,2
"Was taken here by my Dad because it was a Mario Batali restaurant. The setting was awesome, inside of the never dark Venetian Hotel. The food was pretty good and the ambiance was nice. I just think the menu was expensive. Sorry, can't remember what I ate, but I do remember that the food was really good.",2
"What a disappointment! Saw this on a ""best of "" steakhouse list, made reservations way ahead , and , really, no big deal. Better steakhouses in any big city, including several in Denver. Lots of snobby attitude by staff, inedible salads, pretty good steaks, ridiculous prices, bad music played way too loud, and well, that's about it. Fair warning, it's just nothing special for the price.",1
"Every Tuesday I've been here, they have those signs looking like they were just made off the printer that say ""No Tuesday Specials. "" What's going on Popeyes on Stephanie?! How can you NOT have Tuesday specials?! What a waste of gas. The location on boulder highway is my go to place on Tuesdays. They actually follow Popeyes weekly tradition.",1
"Not a big fan of this location. It's small and one hell of a task to get in and out of. At the end of the parking lot for the Giant Eagle nearby you have no idea where the parking lot ends or where the ""road "" begins before the station. The store inside is rather small and much what a convenience store is suppose to be like. Staff are very friendly however.",1
"We had breakfast today at the cafe and was very disappointed with their service. One of the employees was rude and did not help us with the menu. This is not what you expect from Bellagio! nOn speaking to the manager, she was apologetic and also made up for it. Thank you Karen. nHowever good selection of desserts and paninis!",1
"Great late night atmosphere and the food is delicious and prepared right in front of you at the bar. The owner also owns Naked Fish's Sushi and Grill so I expected the same great quality, and boy I WAS NOT disappointed! Everything was great! Also, the Interior is really well done and cozy. I will be back, Kanpai! ",2
"Fantastic service! The prices are at or better than what you would expect to pay at any QUALITY dry cleaner. The dry cleaning, finishing, and tailoring are top notch! The staff is exceptional as well. We were pressed for time and needed something cleaned and pressed within a few hours and they bent over backwards and got it done. NO extra cost. SUPERB!",2
"Zero sense of urgency. All the staff women sit in the back and gossip about random nonsense non business related. Get your a to work, other people have things to do. And thanks for putting sugar in my shake when I specifically asked for none. So much sugar in this smoothie, it might put me in a diabetic coma and I'm not even diabetic. This is ridiculous, FIRE EVERYONE!",1
"While it is somewhat embarrassing to write a review on how good a donut shop is, I feel I must do it. Bosa is hands down the best place in the Valley to eat a donut. They're indescribably good. I've been to many of the locations and they all seem to be consistently good. The product they serve is outstanding and I have been ruined for all other donuts because of this funky little shop.",2
"This is the craziest, smelliest, scariest, busiest, creepiest and closest Circle K to me. This is where the homeless come to pee, the disable crazies come to run into walls with their wheelchairs and all the druggies come to buy rolling papers. This place could seriously be its own reality show. I'd watch it 24 7.",2
"OMG the chicken bowl was great I'm on the HGC diet it's hard finding a place to eat out so I figured Mexican boy was I right! I ordered a chicken bowl with only pico . it needed Nothing else . really satisfying. Place was clean spacious modern. Staff was very friendly, gotta go back try the beef one. keep you posted.",2
"Went to Instyle nails on Silverado for first time and will probably not go back. Girl who did my pedicure was really good however, the nail polish chipped off after first day. After a few days and most of the polish chipping off I went by told them what happened and had them reprint my nails to which they charged me 10.00.",1
"After our visit to Pure we were tipsy and hungry so we were brought here. Took forever to be seated, greeted, and feed. Our server was nice but because of it being a graveyard shift they seemed very understaffed. I ordered a Ham cheese sandwhich which was alright, didn't finish it. Wish we could have found a Dennys which is saying alot.",1
"This was the worst buffet I've visited in a long time. First of all, each type of cuisine only had 3 or 4 selections to choose from and mediocre at best. The pizza tasted worse than a 5 dollar frozen pizza you'd get at the store, the sushi had no flavor, the meatloaf looked like something that was thawed out last week! nOverall bad, didn't even try the dessert.",1
"We stayed on the strip and decided to try the Gamblers special not on the menu. nThe price is right, for 7.77 you get a salad, steak, a skewer of shrimp and mashed potatoes. You can't go wrong with that deal. It filled me up for lunch on the way to the airport. Mr. Lucky is located in the Hard Rock Casino with free parking.",2
Okay even with Groupon giving 60 off you still have to spend 200 to use the 100 certificate that cost 40 so we wound up spending 175 with tip for 3 of us and the food was nasty! The service was awful Texas de Brazille is much better this was no bargain it was the cheapest cuts of meat and for the first time I agree with most of the critics on here! Waste of money! avoid!,1
Love the carts. Pretty much love all the carts. But whenever I eat from any of the carts this must accompany my meal. She has a really large variety of fruits to make smoothies and you can mix and match. There are also non fruit things that you can add like chocolate but I always stick to the fruit. MmmmmmmMMm.,2
"Had an appointment for a ONE hour massage. Arrived 15 minutes early, quickly filled out paperwork and waited. Got called back 5 min after my appt time, my massage didn't start until 10 minutes after my scheduled appt time and then ended 10 min early so instead of a one hour massage, I really got a 40 minute mediocre massage.",1
"Went here for an industry party.it was great! Our drinks were superb, appetizers were yummy! Ambiance was amazing.as to be expected in a Vegas Nightclub.we had our own private floor, which was nice to be able to mingle and talk to everyone. Sadly, didn't stay long because of our dinner reservations, but great place.",2
"No fresh food here, everything was previously frozen. My husband and I ate here for the 1st time today and it will be our last. The fish was greasy, the vegetables were from a frozen bag, the fruit was from a can, the buscuits were cold and had flour sprinkled on top to ""appear "" homemade. Also, I've never been to a country restaurant that doesn't serve sweet tea.a country staple.",1
They get the job done and no complaints here. There is one nail tech that is very easy to understand and I like going to her. I have only gotten acrylics put on here two or three times and have been satisfied each time. If you are an ASU student look for their coupons in The Student Handbook each year.,2
"If you love cocky pieces of crap that will try and rip you off and have no clue what there talking about . I would highly recommend this place , If you want to go to a real Harley dealership with heart and soul and its family owned, Buddy Stubbs is awesome I will never go anywhere else . Everyone there is really chill and incredibly knowledgeable and they actually treat you with respect .",1
"Disturbingly long waits. While waiting in line, the EZ Car Rental right next store, went through 5 people while I stood there. Actually was probably more, but it only dawned on me to start counting when i got really bored. I probably waited in line for a good 20 mins, maybe closer to 25. If time is something you value, this may not be your best choice.",1
This is by far the worst airline! Rude customer service. The manager at the PHx airport is such a B . When I asked a question. They look at you in disgust. As if you are supposed to know all the answers. I have been stuck here for almost 8 hours with no explanation! Never ever will I fly this airline again!,1
"Staff is rude and unprofessional. After my procedure they were quick to ignore a progressing medical issue yet were great at taking my financial information. It may be difficult to ignore this place since many surgeons use this location, but just ask yourself Is my safety less important than my convenience?",1
"Holy cow! This place is truly a diamond in the rough. North Las Vegas has the pizza place that I have been looking for. The service was great, very friendly. The food was amazing! The crust of our pizza was great. The sauce was perfect. The ingredients were bar none quality. If you like bacon I highly recommend getting any pizza with at least the bacon.",2
"I am changing my life style and this place is helping. I use to spend 12 15 dollars a DAY on fast food. Now I'm like why did I ever waste my life on crap, everything at this place is so freaking delicious. I'm having the ostrich burger and all I can say is WOW! If eating healthy and clean is your way here's the place for you. It is for me! ",2
"Have been here several times and so far, only one dish was OK the pasta dish under Health Conscious. All the other dishes have been disappointing, including the Fruit Crepes which I had today, the omelette which was overcooked, the pancakes which have been tasteless. For breakfast, I would be better off going to IHOP.",1
"Superbe endroit pour manger de la nourriture typiquement salvadorienne ou mexicaine. Le resto n'a l'air de rien de l'ext u00e9rieur, mais l'int u00e9rieur vient tout juste d' u00eatre r u00e9nov u00e9. u00c0 essayer, les pupusas, les tacos fritos et les enchiladas. Tout y est excellent et vraiment pas cher.",2
"Look past the extremely tacky conveyor belt style whiskey history ride and you'll see a fantastic intro to whiskey tasting. The staff are great and their knowledge of Scotland's whiskey history is great. You'll get to understand taste the diverse range of tastes whiskey can offer, see the largest collection of whiskey great for some classy vacation photos and keep a glass. Worth it.",2
Like all other Gordon Ramsay restaurants this place is sure to impress. Every detail is carefully engineered down to the outfits that the bus boys wear. The food is amazing and all of the staff is well educated about it and the amazing wine beer list. The vibe is upscale energetic and fun with a british twist. Loved it!,2
"After reading the yelp review, I decided to give this place a try since it's super close to my house. The only two things that I have tried were bun bo hue and pork spring rolls. The pork spring rolls were okay, but bun bo hue became my fav. bun bo hue in vegas nMy only complaint about this place is the lighting, it feels weird inside and makes my eyes uncomfortable.",2
i like that it wasn't overly crowded and the music was great! nmaybe i liked the people there because we knew most of them? or maybe the vibe was just different. ni like the fact that i can chill and then get up and dance and have room to move around. nthe drinks were kinda strong but that's a good thing!,2
"After having tried the slop they try to pass off as Red Beef Curry at Komol, I'm giving this place an extra star for their delicious food. Apparently Le Thai is as good as it gets when it comes to Thai food in Las Vegas. Well prepared, well seasoned, and alway tasty, you will never be unhappy with an order from Le Thai!",2
"Fun place to hike. Well manicured trails plus you can peel off and climb on your own. The trails only go around the buttes but you can find a spot that fits your fitness level and climb up. Make sure you were appropriate shoes if you plan to climb up. Also, check out hole in the rock across the street next to the zoo. Cool rock formation.",2
"Best I've been to so far Pros nGood variety of music nHuge space nFloor plan is amazing because they got so much room nIts like a clubbers paradise as soon as you walk i nCons nLine is about a mile long if you get there at 10 00 10 30 nA little pricey nbouncers are pretty up tight im a guy so thats expected, they're only nice to hot girls ",2
"I have been to this EyeMasters store on two occasions once to place an order for contact lenses, and once to pick the order up. On both occasions I had to wait an unacceptably long time to be helped. This store is seriously understaffed so, unless you have a lot of time to kill, take your business elsewhere. Plus, the prices aren't that good.",1
"I was in Madison for work recently and ate at the Old Fashioned after my shuttle driver recommended it. I was not disappointed. I had dinner one night with my parents and brother who had driven up from Milwaukee and everyone enjoyed it. Then, I had Saturday brunch with my other brother and it was downright remarkable. Don't bother waiting for a table. Sit at the bar and soak up the kitsch.",2
"These guys are a scam! They advertise prices online, but when you show up, the prices they quote you are about 40 less than what they advertise on line. Packed up my 400 lbs of copper and brass and went a couple miles up the street and actually received a fair price for my scrap. Would not recommend these guys to my worst enemy.",1
The Beatles show was amazing seen it September! If you come to Vegas see the Beatles show it's good it had a lot of good music things going on in it. My favorite part is when they did the all white blanket and the bubbles and the back flip with the rollerblades was cool. But I could go on and on but you have to go see it for yourself!,2
"Gourmet sandwiches? done and done. this place does not skimp on the toppings. The Bobby is my fav, with turkey and stuffing and cranberry sauce. Thanksgiving every time. Great every time. Really good, really good service, really high quality product. I belong to the text club and get free drinks and chips, so its and even better deal. Love this place for a fast meal.",2
"We have stayed here twice. Once as a groupon and once as a comp. it's such a cleaeat hotel we love it. Next time we are bringing the kids to enjoy the pool and the movies. We will stay here again. The buffet on Tuesday mmmmm. Also breakfast is a steal at 5.99. Great place, great value. Especially when you're not a fan of the strip.",2
"This was the most boring terrible cirque show ever .save your money and spend it on something else .dont know how anyone could stay awake it is so slow and no acrobatics in it .just awful.dont know what show some of theses people saw but my family and i SAW THIS SHOW ON JAN 3,2013 and I have to give it one star cause the app make me.mark",1
"I heard great things about this place and went a few weeks ago and was disappointed to say the least. I thought I ordered the wrong thing and tried it again today and it was worse then before. The service and environment is nice, however the food is subpar at best. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. PS 3 hours after eating there I feel sick!",1
"Wanted to love this place. They did an OK job but the design wasn't what I wanted even after I tried to communicate it several times. I eventually gave up after it was already on my nails. He was gentle but hardly filed shaped my nails. So some are rounded and some are squared. Also, the lotion he used smelled like men's deodorant.",1
Wow! They got me good. nBooked through Orbitz so it's non refundable. Very old bldg slump block with equally old carpet sheets. Maybe worth 45 . Not the nearly 200 I got taken for! nPlease I just hope there are no BED BUGS. nNo way do they EVER get repeat business! nThis place should be condemned. nPlease Mr. Wynn. Buy this level it!,1
"I am extremely disappointed by this site and will never recommend Liberty Tax to anyone again. Their 50.00 refer a person is a false advertisement and scam. If you refer someone who owes money, you get nothing. I am so disgusted and angry not because of the 50.00 not coming to me but that I was made a fool of. DO NOT USE LIBERTY TAX. They have no class or character.",1
"Just tried chocking down what this place called Kung Pao Chicken. About three pieces of chewy chicken covered, I mean absolutely covered in peanuts and cucumbers. Chicken fried rice also had the same consistency chewy chicken. Horrible, tasteless and I hope I don't have to visit emergency room later for uncooked chicken.",1
When dining here you must sit on the patio that overlooks the 18th green. It is absolutely picturesque. To start your meal have the Navajo corn chowder. It has a little kick to it but it's extremely tasty. For an entree the Sonoran Chicken Pasta or the Southwestern Chicken Wrap are my personal favorites.,2
"The food was good, portions were adequate meaning here that you are full afterwards but not too full , reasonably priced for the portions you're getting. The staff was very nice and smiley, but we had to wait a little long by the end of the meal. They actually apologized for the wait, which made it ok. It's got a very kitch decor that makes it quite unusual and unique. Very friendly over all.",2
"Never eat here in the day time, why would you? The food is awful and it's a hilarious irony that this place calls itself a Pizzeria. It is however open late at night, yet no amount of alcohol can mask the awful quality of the food here. I've sat in once and the food was no better than some sort of jumped up tuck shop with a faulty oven. The Pizza is bad and they should feel bad.",1
"Raising Cane's is awesome. I always order the Big Box, The Fingers are made fresh and come out HOT. So its best to let them cool off for a bit. The French Fries are good, offering Onion RIngs wouldnt be a bad thing. The Staff are always friendly and checking to make sure everything is ok. Something about the sauce. I prefer the Sweet Tea. You wont be disappointed.",2
I would suggest not going to this place. The service is terrible. We had a coupon from the radio shopping show to try this place out. They would not honor the coupon and ruined the night for everyone involved. It is a mystery why they would take the effort try to drum up business by putting out a coupon and then be so rude about not honoring it. They lost my business forever.,1
"This place knows how to throw a party! Full bar service, drinks reasonably priced, and super friendly bartenders all around. The food is not stellar, but it's edible, considering that it's probably frozen, prepared food. But if you are watching basketball all day long, it's a good way to take the edge of your vodka tonics. Very friendly staff, nice building, all around great experience.",2
"Hands down the WORST night club or whatever you want to call it that I have been to. I actually went way back in April, but didn't remember that I wanted to review it until recently. Tank Tops, flip flops and ""Don't Stop Believing "" is not my idea of a good time! Don't make it to Charlotte that often but Will NEVER go back to this place and would NEVER recommend it to anyone else!",1
"An expensive tapa's restaurant. Almost everything is great, but realize that everything is pricey. nHighly recommend the white sangria. Wow, never thought white sangria would be good, actually better than their red. nDefinitely order the paella at the beginning so they can get it started then holler at sangria and tapas, leaving room for the paella at the end!",2
Check out San Tan Flat again it been awhile since I've been here. Atmosphere 5 stars Food 1 2 stars skip the big stuff not worth it. nService 1 2 stars Service was even worse the last time I went. Thank GOD there new places opening up in town. Nothing but a tourist trap for over price food and drinks. People do yourself a favor spend your money elsewhere.,1
"Superb grilled chicken amazingly crispy skin, excellent with rice or chips. The salad and peri peri sauce are both great as well. We've eaten at a few different Portuguese places in Montreal and this stands out as a fave. Service can be a little slow, but the food is worth the wait. Really nice on the terrace in the summertime too.",2
Grabbed some lunch and was very happy we chose this option. Five of us are here. Everyone chose a different burger or sandwich. All thoroughly enjoyed them. Very tasty. Large burgers. Fries that come with the burgers are a mix of different fries and were really good. We also shared a dessert fried ice cream sundae . It was big enough for 4 5 people and very good.,2
Went in there with a fixture I purchased almost a year ago that failed. Fully intended to buy a new one. The kind lady at the counter said it should have lasted longer than that and gave me a new one. No receipt or nothing. I did buy it there . That kind of service will keep me going there for any of my lighting needs. You just don't find that kind of service anymore. Except my store.,2
"I went here for a nice lunch one afternoon. A nice lunch is NOT what I got. My food was awful. I got the lunch pasta special, which tasted just like a cheap frozen dinner. The chicken was bland and dry, and the sauce WAY OVER PRICED FOR MICROWAVE FOOD! I may go back to try something else, but I hardly write reviews. This was the worst food I have had in Phoenix yet.",1
"We made our first visit a couple of weeks ago and rated the food above average. The choices of toppings are extensive, the quality of beef is good and ours was well cooked. nThey also have some interesting milkshakes to choose from, and the fries basket was very generous. nThe place is small but we didn't have to wait long to be seated when we arrived at 6 30 on a Friday night.",2
Arcadia cleaners was able to fix a disaster last week my son's fiance pulled her wedding dress out of their car after traveling from Kansas to find it covered in green candle wax I brought it right in to Arcadia cleaners and within 3 hours they called to say it was white again. We are all so thankful! I'm telling everyone about how they saved the day!,2
"Has what I need usually, ok priced but the guy ALWAYS tries to sell me extra stuff I don't need or the more expensive stuff! And rude about it when you try to tell him nicely you want only what you came in for. You ask him for prices and he gets an attitude because he has to work. He is just plain rude! if it weren't for location, I would go somewhere else",1
"This is a cool Starbucks , great atmosphere , tons of seating inside and out . Staff are fine , they remember my name and I only go once a week. They've got a dog bowl for Ozzy , wifi works , they pick up the old newspapers and clear the tables . No drive thru so when I'm starting a road trip with the family I do the Lake Mead Rampart Starbucks. Very popular with local hot moms so dress nice guys!",2
"The most amazing place I have eaten at. It was based on small portions tapas , but they didn't skimp you in flavor,amount, or the price. The service was excellent! Except for the hostess's they were a little snotty, but we didn't care our servers were wonderful and the bussers were so efficient and fast! We were visiting Vegas and ate there twice within our stay! Thank you we will be back!",2
"Now this is what I'm talking about. Authentic food, located right in the thick of working class neighborhood. Lucha Libre D u00eda de los Muertos artwork give me something cool to look at as I devoured a killer GOURMET HANDMADE CORN QUESA ! The owner was super cool chatted with me about the unique salsa selection. If you want authentic regional Mexican food, then go here or go die.",2
The experience was generally good. Service was a little slow for as few people that appeared to be there. Lettuce wraps were good. Drinks were good Long Island ice tea . The sushi was good California roll deluxe . Dessert was good chocolate lava cake . The only thing would have changed would've been the chicken in the Phoenix. I prefer all white meat.,2
"If you don't feel like paying 30 bucks for a meal and you just need to refuel or recover from that Vegas hangover, this is the spot to hit up! nThe portions are definitely larger than most other Panda Expresses and the food is consistently quasi Chinese. It's like McDonald's, you'll always get about the same thing taste wise.",2
"Talk about disappointment. We went here last summer expecting a great german meal. My family is German and we enjoy trying German restaruants for a taste of home. The food was not good, the place run down, and overall gross atmosphere. So sad. I wish someone would come in an fix it up. This place gives German restaurants a bad name. Make your way to Chicago for some great German food.",1
"Avoid! My gastrointestinal system and I deeply regret those tasteless 1 oysters Also, my friend ordered a French 75, the bartender had no clue what it was and, instead of admitting as much, looked it up in a book and ended up simply pouring champagne and gin into red wine glass, which was not really what we wanted to pay for . Also when we asked for the check, we got the wrong person's bill. Sigh.",1
I tried the famous bao first. It's tasty adventure of flavor and texture. All it is bread with different types of meat in it. I had their bbblt next. It's great tasting with flavorful marinade. It's bit heavy so be prepared. They also have healthy choice noodles. This will be my next choice. Good eating.,2
"The most fun yet chill bar I have ever been to. The best part is going Thursday through Saturday day 10am 6pm to see Ian for one of his famous bacon bloody marys.or saying hey to Ryan on swing grave shift. I always love coming here with my man for a beer, good conversation and sometimes.fantastic people watching.",2
"I came to this place for an alignment on my BMW. I did make sure that they can do it over the phone before I bring my car to the shop. After a week, I brought the car back for them to re do it because it shifted to the right. I was shock when they told me their machine could not align on BMW. Why don't they told me upfront? What's a waste of time and money.",1
"VERY OVER RATED! SLOW check in, SNOW ticket pick up, POOL closed at 4 and 5PM on a weekend. Charges for in room frig and internet. Many other extra fees. OVERPRICED Beatles LOVE Show was a great show with high ratings. VALET Service does get 5 stars. Would never go back to this hotel due to choices nearby.",1
"Just like every other Wendy's you've been to, except with slower service! Employees show no sense of urgency. There are two cash registers inside but I've never seen more than one being used at once, no matter how long the line is. Last time I was here, it took 30 minutes from the time I took my place in line until I received my order.",1
"We ate here twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast. It's inexpensive compared to other places on the strip and in the Stratosphere, but the quality of food is variable. The food itself looks, feels and tastes processed, and in every case was under seasoned or maybe not seasoned at all . Service was really good and the retro decor cool, but the food quality lets it down.",1
"Fantastic rowdy bar. Came here late at night and stayed even later. It was totally packed and lively. Got me some Innus Gunn beer, which was my first time, and was fantastic. There was a band playing solid music. Some Scottish guy with a polo tucked into pleated khakis was leaning over and trying to say something, spitting in my face. It was quite genuine.",2
"Massive nightclub with two main stages and multiple bars. Came here to see Porter Robinson and it was unbelievably crowded, even when we got there around 12am. It was still a lot of fun, other then the need to move a couple people out of the way. It also seemed like a great place to come during the day with a massive pool in the middle.",2
"Not even the fortune cookie was good! I paid about 8 for rice and vegetables. My egg drop soup consisted of Campbell's soup. That's it. I mean, this place reminds me I really need to take up cooking because, I just got robbed. The only reason I have it two stars is because it's local. Other than that, I came here to eat rice, peanuts, and Campbell's soup. Dammit!",1
"Not impressed at all. Had the coconut soup and phad Thai. It tasted like it was one of the ""instant "" bowls. I've had Thai several times in my life, I've even purchased some of the Thai instant stuff for my home. The taste was ridiculously similar. It wasn't a good experience at all. I won't be back, unfortunately. I was really excited about this place seeing all the reviews.",1
I would always buy my steaks at the grocery store just because if the convenience. A while back I decided to try this place out to see the difference and I haven't bought steaks anywhere else since. This place is awesome! The steaks are awesome! The service is awesome! And the prices are awesome! Never buy your meat at the grocery store again!,2
"For people who feel adventurous, try ""Le canibale "". It is a tartare raw meat made with either beef or horse meat. I prefer horse meat much less fat than beef extra spicy. Eat that food with a very strong dark beer. Watch the menu for all the assortment of cold sauces mayo style for the excellent French fries.",2
Really wanted to like this place but the first time I was there I wasn't told about the burger special fron 2 4. I came back the next week and ordered the burger special but the cashier wasn't sure what burger was included with the special. Apparently cheeseburgers aren't included or the cheese is really expensive. Whataburger is about as good with much better service.,1
"I have noticed this deli for a while, it is right down the street from my work. Today I thought I would give it a try and am glad I did! It is a family owned shop, very friendly people. I ordered the Albondigas Soup, fresh and homemade and quite delicious! The menu looks like a wide variety and great prices. I can't wait to go back to try one of the sandwiches!",2
"Love this place! Great, traditional delicious American food that always pleases. The giant salads with homemade dressings and croutons are to die for! The management is so pleasant to work with as I have hosted a few private parties here! Lunch, dinner, big or small groups August Henry's is my clutch American joint downtown that never disappoints!",2
"The name has changed but I still say that the food is great. My boyfriend whose originally from Thailand said that he was surprised just how authentic the food was. The waitress was sweet and the food came rather quickly. I had the Panang Curry while he had the spicy catfish. Quite possibly the best thing about it is the price, very cheap.",2
Closed Yoshinoya closed their only restaurant here in Arizona and broke my heart! How I miss the Yoshinoya of Los Angeles. Santa Monica Blvd and Vermont or the 2 on Wilshire one in K town and the other at Alvarado in McArthur Park District. I miss you Yoshinoya. Please come back. Your food is excellent ,2
" 27 per person on a Saturday morning. After waiting in line, for LESS THAN DENNY'S quality, we left shaking our heads and feeling terribly ripped off! Horrible. Do NOT, I repeat, not go to this. Not a single thing was good. Extremely limited selections. Downright terrible. Caesars, you should be ashamed.",1
"They have thick crust pizza! Since I've moved to Pittsburgh, I've been on the hunt for great think crust pizza . and now I have two places to go here and Pizza Perfecta in Shadyside ! I got the Chicago style pizza which I think was great! I definitely plan on coming back to try their other types of pizza.",2
"This place amazing to just walk around in the interior is beautiful, you must look up to see the ceilings! Any place where you can actually make pee pee on the Berlin Wall gets my approval! urinals are attached to a piece of the wall. Ask an employee to point you in the direction of the bathroom it is located in. I would explain but it would take a while.",2
"I First Met Don in 1973 when I ordered my first Pepperoni Sausage Pizza. Don use to work the counter himself and was always a very customer service kinda guy. I really miss him , but I'll never miss this Pizza cause I'll ALWAYS be a customer. As far as rateing , this place will be on my TOP 5 till I die.",2
This location is ridiculous.I need to stop coming here but it is right around the corner from my job. Sometimes I just get my coffee from circle k. The staff is slow the manager well he is just plain out rude. They often get our order wrong. UGH! so frustrating when you need your morning coffee. Oh they never have the food we want.,1
"This has become my go to lunch spot. The salad toppings are always fresh and varied, the falafel is great and the prices can't be beat for a healthy, quick meal. The staff is super friendly, too! They usually have samples of their yummy smoothies out on the counter for customers to try which is a nice touch while you're paying your bill.",2
My boyfriend is obsessed with Dillys so I agreed to go with him after a hike. I was ravenous and ordered the roast beef sandwich on dark rye. Very disappointing. The meat honestly tasted like baloney ugh very weird texture. I almost felt tricked? I may give the BLT a try next time but not a good first impression ,1
"Pretty sure this is the slowest one on the planet. Also, I'm pretty sure I have never received a verbal ""thank you, "" despite my frequent patronage. The inside is slow because the drive thru takes precedence, yet the drive through is interminable. They also don't have a dog water bowl. I think I'll drive the extra mile over to Perk Up.",1
"The name of this place might be a bit long but the food and service is outstanding. Finally had a chance to eat here sunday. The greek omelette was perfect for my liking and the waitress was attentive. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it was a first visit and i reserve that for future visits. As the name implies ""family "" place without any trendy vibe.",2
"Food is ok, but the service is too bad, refer in particular to the Chinese waiter in the restaurant. Different people, different attitude, I give them the tips, but he worry we don't pay it, sucks uff0c u4e2d u6587 u8bf4 u4f60 u5c31 u662f u6709 u4f60 u8fd9 u6837 u7684 u534e u4eba u771f u662f u4e22 u8138. I like the Chinese young waitress, so nice.",1
"came here for breakfast on saturday morning. It was busy but we were seated quickly. Waited about 10 minutes for the waitress to see us, and then waited some more for the really bad coffe to come. Food was ok. Coffee is not worth the 2.19 each that you pay for it. Waitress was condescending and snooty. Technically polite, but you could tell her heart was not in it. nNot sure if we would go back.",1
Good Broccolini. And delicious crab w guacamole. Pleasantly surprised! I agree with other reviews that the quality of food is good for the price you pay. Seared yellowtail with pepper was also quite good. If you're staying at the Wynn would definitely consider eating here for the price. Dinner was almost 100 less than Gordon Ramsey steak house and B and B.,2
"I really wanted this place to be amazing because it's in my neighborhood I enjoy supporting local biz whenever possible, but it was just ok. The honey tofu, which I was super excited about after reading other reviews, was somewhat soggy even though I ordered ""extra crispy. "" The fried rice was a decent texture but didn't have any veggies in it. Probably won't be back, bummer.",1
"The food was okay, I don't know what the hype was about this place. I mean it's kind of cool they never close and the decor was neat but food was not good, drinks on the other hand were pretty good. Desserts were just freaking large, def. have to share if you order. I really love the desserts at Serendipity a lot more but that's just me. ",1
"EXCELLENT job! Quick call back, on time, dependable, clean, friendly, knowledgeable and did a fantastic job on our travertine floors! The owners are involved and their team has a great work ethic. So hard to find people who actually care about the job they do these guys have it down. I will use them again and highly recommend them.",2
"Only great things to say about this place had a drive thru not too fat and lazy to walk in but ice cream and December cold outside , they saw a dog in the car with me and they gave him his own ice cream bowl for free, and the price tag for the ice cream was overall reasonable! Would recommend this location to anyone!",2
"Good maid service I've had other companies and individuals cleaners too, but Planet Hugger is fast and efficient. Sometimes they come outside of their arrival window but they work hard. I always use email and get a prompt response even on the weekend. Very reasonable prices too. My house never smells like chemicals either after they've been there and that is really important to us.",2
"There is nothing bad about Macaroni Grill, if you have a large group and can't decide on a place it can actually be alright. I just don't have much faith in Italian chains in general. I've gone there with a group 6 8 times and was there just recently and I can't recall anything I've ate. I have negative aspiration to return.",1
"The food sounded so good. We had a bunch of sushi, garlic chicken, and malasada sundae. But I feel it was a trap. I felt the portions were big. But my seared ahi tasted funny. It had a tangy taste what the hell? Three people in my party got stomach aches the following morning. You'll have to make your own assumptions from there.",1
"My buddies and I were starving after watching the Ohio State Northwestern. Someone in our group suggested this place. I had misgivings about a possible tourist trap right on the strip. I was wrong. We had a very good server. We had some pretty good chicken wings. I had the BBQ brisket sandwich. Maybe I was hungry, it did turn out to be a terrific sandwich.",2
"I really really dig this place. nI've only ever been for the Sunday brunch, on two occasions to be exact. Both times I also got a bit drunk, because of the bottomless mimosas and bellinis. Both times I got the eggs benedict, and they were PERFECT nLoved the taste of the champagne hollandaise sauce. So yeah, free booze, great food, seasonal menus, swank decor and super nice service 5 stars!",2
"Super small portions, for a lot of . We had two courses each and were still hungry afterwards. Shared plates aren't enough for a single person. I was very disappointed, on top of being tiny, it was absolutely nothing special about the food. Very average food, extremely small portions, a lot of cash. Poor to mediocre service.",1
"I always love coming here. They have a fantastic cocktail list, skilled and friendly bartenders, and a cozy atmosphere. I also usually like the music it varies but I often here Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Spoon, Wilco, etc. . When it gets very crowded late on a Friday Saturday , there isn't much standing room, so I prefer coming other days of the week. One of my favorite bars in town!",2
"This club is wicked brilliant! I loved the setting and freshness! No wait whatsoever! Amazing VIP table experience! Awesome cirque de solei however that's spelled dancers roaming the area. BE CAREFUL if you're quite pissed drunk and want to go to the dance floor, there's plenty stairs and you CAN fall. Wouldn't want that happening now would we? Fun club!",2
"It was a great time being at India Palace. I love the food and service both. Particular, Gary is the guy who provide us excellent service whenever I been here with my friends. He always recommend us few things and we enjoy 'em all. Thank you very much Gary, we truly like your service. I strongly recommend to visit this place if you fond of Indian food.",2
"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION.We stayed here for my 40th birthday weekend without kids! This place has a ""secret "" elevator enterance to the Cosmopolitan. Our room was great, we had a perfect view of the Bellagio fountain. We only paid 179.00 for the week and you can't beat that in January! I would stay here again. It doesn't really compare to the Polo Towers but I still liked it!",2
"What an amazing little cafe! Really lovely food. Had a quiche and 3 different side salads carrot raisin, zucchini with pepper and yellow bell pepper, and celery root. nEverything is homemade and delicious. Decor is dinerish feel, but small and clean. nMy favorite part was the sweet man who ran the place. He was so friendly and said that the food was delicious because it was made with love. nSweet!",2
"Apparently Pamela's is a most try for their pancakes, but I wasn't impressed. It tasted like a thin, greasy, fried crepe. I prefer my pancakes light, fluffy, and melting in my mouth. Seeing as how the pancakes are the main attraction, I'm not in a hurry to go back. The service was average to slow, due to the large crowds, and the decor atmosphere is just ok.",1
"I accidentally went on a school fundraiser night the line was long but the staff was working quickly. They were all friendly and helpful, the ice cream was rich and delicious and to top it off I had a buy one get one free coupon from my dentist. Without the coupon I would say the pricing is on the higher end.",2
I was taken to dinner tonight for my birthday. I wanted the prawns and they didn't have them. We ordered the tuna salad and the tuna was well done and tasteless. We ordered risotto and one was bland and the other too spicy. We ordered grilled bread that was truly tasteless. I would not go back nor recommend this restaurant to anyone that is seeking a tasty meal.,1
"Loved it! Clean, professional atmosphere and resonably priced. Industry employees get an additional 10 percent off of services. I have been getting brazilians since I was 18 and tried my fair share in Vegas, first time I have felt comfortable getting a brazilian on an establishment for the first time. I hope that makes sense PORTIA was amazing! 5 star service",2
i went to the Todd English P.U.B thinking it would be great and it started that way and then the food came i had a grilled cheese with brie and bacon it was kida good my brother had a chili dog it was not so good and my mom got the lobster rolls they were also disappointing and so were the desserts but the atmosphere was great and the service was good but i don't think i will be eating here again.,1
I was so excited to go to this place and boy did it not disappoint! Hummus was delicious and their fun twist on the jalapeno poppers was cool and freaking awesome . I had the blue burger and it was perfectly cooked! Onion rings were the best I have had! I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat here! The service was great too!,2
"Nice place to hang out with a margarita on a weekend afternoon. Great food and atmosphere, with mountain views and quietness. They even let us bring our dog to dine on the outdoor patio. Order the calamari for an appetizer I've never seen it prepared so well. My only gripe was that they didn't offer happy hour prices outside. only at the bar, where nobody was.",2
"They have mediocre milkshakes for big bucks. I've been on two occasions. I ordered a strawberry and banana milkshake and a cake n' shake milkshake, and have taste other people's orders. There is NOTHING special about their milkshakes or ice cream. Same taste as most other places for double the price. Nothing special about the atmosphere, and the singing is really awkward rather than funny or cute.",1
The people in the shoe department were very helpful for such a busy day. The clothing department and cosmetics similarly provided very good customer service. The sales are great. I also like that they changed their credit card rewards where you can earn 10 certificates and not just the 10 certificates.,2
"Went there expecting something special. NOPE nEggs in A Hole. more like soaked in butter. nTo add insult to injury. nAwful. Hair in my food. 'nuff said 15 minutes later when the so called manager came, some little girl with no presence, and I told her I wanted noodles from Beijing no 9, she thought I was kidding.",1
"I love this location. I will be back again and again. I have come in here many times, sometimes there is an off Sales rep but 90 of the time I have worked with a very helpful, pleasant, non pushy person. On top of that they have a great selection of beautiful rings and jewelry . Prices aren't as bad as I thought they would be. They also have customer appreciation discounts every so often.",2
"Dined here with a friend recently. I recommend the dinner menu rather than the sushi and appetizers, our sushi and appetizer items were mediocre at best. My dinner selection was good, my friend's dinner selection was bland. The service was fair albeit disorganized, we had to ask the manager to summon the waitress for our appetizer order. I may return to give another chance.",1
"I LOVE cupcakes. It's addiction, really. I have tried all the local places around charlotte for cupcakes. Gigi's is right up there with some of my favs. i like their products because they are consistent. My favorites are the wedding cake and the salted caramel. The boxes the cupcakes come in are really nice and they keep them from moving around or smashing the frosting!",2
"This is one of the best buildings in Montreal! 4 swimming pools, spa, sauna, steam room, rooftop terrace and game room. I would disregard Eli W.'s review because I think he made an error, it is not a commercial building but a private residential one so there is no administration or rental office so it makes no sense https www.airbnb.ca rooms 1594063",2
"I definitely am never disappointed here! nThey allow you to take from the salad bar which is full of amazing food, cheeses, meats, and the lobster bisque is definitely a favorite. nThey come around with different kinds of meat and you can say no, don't be afraid! My favorite cuts are the sirloin, leg of lamb, lamb chops, and flank steak. Everyone should go there at least once a year!",2
"What a cool spot I found tonight. A twelve minute walk from my Loft brought me to their front counter. A sign asked If I was a Veteran. I replied, ""YES "". Amber comped my delicious homemade pizza. I bought a few freshly baked pastries for breakfast tomorrow. A family owned enterprise, staffed by people who care. I CAN'T WAIT FOR MY BREAKFAST PASTRIES TOMORROW AM !",2
First time here and Josh was our server. Week worth the few minute wait. The Carrot Cake pancakes were simply amazing! Everything came out hot and Josh was always at the table with a smile and making sure we were all set. For 7 of us it was under 70 so the price was definitely right. This place is worth the trip if you don't live in this part of town. We will be back for sure.,2
Popped into Pike's before the Thursday Night Saints Panthers game bc it was far enough away from the stadium to not be crowded. What I found was a great atmosphere and reasonably priced top notch food. My chicken breast was delicious and my dads said the chicken pot pie special was the best he's ever eaten. Will be a regular stop for me from now on.,2
When a customer ask for napkins it is possible they need more than the two you so kindly reminded me were in my bag. Rude . It just so happens that YOU over filled my drink and it spilled. But I won't let your poor interactions with your customer navigate my day. The one star rating will let my people know ,1
"Took Maddie here for a quick nail trim, was super impressed. Friendly staff, prompt service, and light on the wallet. What more could you want. My dog is with me always, so I wont need the boarding services, but will definitely make this my new pet vet! My co workers have gone to the vaccination clinic they have where they were also impressed by the service and low price! Thumbs up for this place!",2
"Was there last 2 years ago but my experince then has kept me from going back. The food is mediocore at best and its way over priced for what you get. A 60 bill for burgers, fries and shakes for 2 is just a joke. Maybe it's better now but I would doubt it. I would not be surprised if it were closed the next time I visit Vegas.",1
Poor customer service. Waited at the counter for 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledge I was there. This place was run by young kids. I didn't see one responsible adult in there. Finally after 10 minutes I got my wrap then had to wait longer for my smoothie. This location definitely needs a lot of improvement before I will go again.,1
The Luxor was pretty decent. A scratch on the wall is no biggie. Especially in Vegas. I mean you barely spend any time in the room. Check in was good but when we got to our room one lamp didn't work and we had no remote for the tv. HOWEVER they were VERY prompt to fix these discrepancies. I love their casino and T T is awesome. Would definitely stay again.,2
Been here twice and I had the roast beef both times. My vegetarian fiancee got the goat cheese cucumber sandwich and we loved them both. Add the great chips and the designer sodas and you are in business. A little bit pricey but when you consider it is gourmet sandwiches than it is not so bad. We love all things top chef so that is an added bonus.,2
"Worst customer service EVER. LEARN TO ANSWER YOUR PHONES. They never answer their phones, and if by some OFF chance they do, they say they have something and then when you go down there to pick it up, THEY DON'T HAVE IT. Or anything remotely close to what you asked for in the first place. Thanks but no thanks. They will no longer be getting our business.",1
"Went to buddy v last night for dinner. Unfortunately I won't be back. I simply ordered the ravioli. When it arrived it was so under cooked it was inedible. I made comment to the server, who honestly handled the issue well and had the order remade. Unfortunatly the second effort was only was only marginally better and was sent back. Would not go back",1
"No customer service. There was one employee handling the ink department register, one person handling the print shop register, and two employee wanderers. I and a young lady behind me took turns waiting in both lines hoping to be helped. Everyone managed to effectively ignore us for 15 minutes before I gave up. No one teaches customer service anymore!",1
"This place is a dream come true. From the pans, to the candy molds, the cake toppers and the pre made icings, it's pure sugary heaven. I thought I would be able to just walk in walk out, but instead, I spent an hour walking up and down the aisles, determined to check everything out. nI absolutely adore this store, and will be making another trip VERY soon!",2
"Lowes locally reps this line. They lack local installers, at least when I wrote this, so lead times for quotes took forever. And when they finally sent me a bid, weeks longer than it should have, their pricing wasn't competitive, nor worth the wait and hassle. I paid 35 for a hassle and worthless quote.",1
"This walmart gets worse wver time I go there. The employees are the most rude associates I've ever seen. Last night when I was there they wwre actually arguing with customers. Then when the ""manager "" came over she was even worse! Guess it does really come from the top down. There are 2 other Walmart's that are within a few miles of this one. Its worth the extra drive!",1
"Decided to stop here because it was easy to get to. The service was sub par. We watched people that sat down after us get their food and drinks before us. Their food selection isn't that great and the food isn't very good either. However, their specialties alcoholic candy drinks were pretty good. They were of course pricey.",1
Best meal we've had on our trip to Vegas. Everything that our table ordered was super good. I halved the shrimp and lobster mac and cheese and BP burger and the shrimp and lobster mac and cheese is the best mac and cheese I've ever had and the burger was soo juicy and didn't need anything extra added to it. This is definitely a place we'll continue to go to when we visit Vegas.,2
"It's a bit off the beaten path but not entirely inaccessible, positioned just north of a cluster of ethnic restaurants along Queens Street Gardens East. Ordered bibimpab and kimchi fried rice for take away good balance between home quality cooking and restaurant presentation. Really enjoyed the raw egg and chives atop the bibimbap. Be careful walking those steep stairs.",2
"I don't think this place is new, but they definitely don't have their stuff together. When I go to the one in central Phoenix they have my sandwich ready by the time I fill my drink. I don't expect that but this was unbelievably slow. Wheat bread is gross here too, It looks they just got it from the grocery store.",1
"I would suggest going anywhere else. We waited for over 30 minutes for one shuttle to come pick us up. Once we got there, there were 4 employees just sitting around not helping any guests. The service was not great and they promised things and did not follow through. I ended up canceling my car, waiting for their bus to take me back, and then going to a different car company.",1
"I wanted to see Celine Dion sing Celine Dion songs, that didn't happen, she sang covers most of the time? Her voice is great, the orchestra was awesome, back up singers were excellent, but whoever decided singing a duet with holograms should be fired. I wouldn't recommend this show unless they changed the cell phone ban and one could entertain oneself with a smartphone.",1
Same as the first review. It's close and near my place of employment but unfortunately every time I try it out the chicken tenders are always dry as hell. The corn and potatoes can be kept on a heat lamp for the most part but when it comes to the chicken it should be cooked to order. Skip Popeye's Louisiana and head to canes.,1
I like TK Maxx. Some things are bargains others so not but hey you gotta raid a little bit. best time to go is first thing on a week day as it's so quiet. It's in Meadowbank retail park and bus a good bus route to it plus parking for cars. It's a big store so lots to choose from and the staff are friendly too.,2
I only stick to the tacos because I'm not into the monster burrito stuff. They do have some of the best shredded beef and it's great in their tacos and taco salad. The one thing that sets this place apart from the rest besides the great meat the salsa. Their Habanero salsa is outstanding tasty and spicy.,2
i went here for dinner with my friends.it is an awesome restaurant.i love it.the staff are very friendly and they recommend all the good things.i love the foie gras especially.the kobe beef tendon was also nice. the fish i guess almost all of it taste good.the crab also very delicious.everything is super fresh and good! CONCLUSION RECOMMENDED!,2
"My friends and I had a great time at Prive! There was quite a crowd in line, but we got in free and in good time b c we were all girls. The music was pretty good and the dance floor was spacious. They also had cocktail girls walking around offering free shots vodka, i think . The decor was pretty nice, too. Chandeliers everywhere. All in all, a good night!",2
No one here knows anything. Friend registered here and just had the worst experiences ever. Crib arrived broken and had to be reordered. Everything she registered for wasn't in stock and every employee doesn't know anything cause they disappear to find one that does. Every time I'm with her it's so frustrating. I would never Come back.,1
"Wait was terrible. It was Friday night after 10 pm and the place was busy. We were a party of four. Our flatbread was cold and placed on a menu on the table, dishes not cleared, no butter or oil offered. Brought entree before salad. When we asked for more bread, he brought 2 pcs for four people Not sure if he was mad we didn't order drinks or wine?",1
Classy place with a great brunch menu and a friendly staff. I had the full Irish breakfast and a friend of mine had the BLT. Both were great with lots of homemade ingredients. Despite being stuffed we had beignets for dessert with bacon ice cream which was again delicious. Very interesting place and reasonably priced for such a great experience.,2
"It is a fun park. Playful dogs, friendly peolpe, and pretty well kept! My sister and I took our dogs there twice so far and we love it! There are a few fun obstacles that are fun to watch my dog do. There is some areas with quite a bit of mud, but other than that it was fun! I would definitely recommended it!",2
"I think this place is awesome. It's not huge, so don't expect a fully stocked grocery store but the stuff they have is always great. They have lots of prepared food that all you need to do is heat it up at home microwave or oven . Super easy and healthy.and affordable for what you're getting. Perfect for someone looking to be able to ""cook "" quick and healthy meals.",2
Poor customer service. We have a home warranty. The chain broke on our garage door and was hanging from the opener. Called Hung Rite and was told someone would call us this morning between 7 30 8 00. No call. We called them and then were told it would be 2 days before they could get here. Are you kidding me!,1
"Was really disappointed to find out that this isn't a bakery and is just a boutique the bakery is downtown . The only thing I could buy was a package of mini cupcakes. Ugh. They're not in a temperature controlled environment, so the frosting is like liquid. Kinda gross. And the cupcakes themselves? Go somewhere else. The only one I liked was the caramel cupcake. Not worth the 10.",1
"I was finally able to get into TJ's yesterday and I'm glad I did. The food was homemade home style deliciousness at dirt cheap prices. My party got the cinnamon roll French toast and the farmers breakfast. Obviously not the healthiest dining option, but that's not why you go to TJ's, you go here to indulge in home cooking. Finally found my favorite breakfast joint in Avondale!",2
We stopped in after our movie at the Wisconsin Film Festival. They were not expecting a crowd on this usually slow Sunday night. Only one waiter and he was overwhelmed. My 1 2 chicken was pretty good but the wedge fries were lukewarm and soft. Wine pours were small. My wife's entree was unacceptable and the waiter took it off the bill.,1
"I bought two overpriced drinks a vodka soda and a vodka cranberry from a grouchy bartender who skipped over people who had been waiting for much longer in order to serve loud drunk girls. Dude, all I wanted was to buy these drinks and go on my way. There were, at most, 7 people at the bar. Took 15 minutes to get a couple of weak drinks. Should have saved my money.",1
"Sprechers Rootbeer on draft pizza spinach salad. Order it. Eat it. Love me. As others have said the dine in experience is not really a good one. That being said if you are looking for an inexpensive piece of good thin crust pizza eat here. I have been several times, the service isn't great, but the portions are huge and the food comes out fresh. Lunch combo is an amazing steal.",2
By far the best coffee to be found in Waterloo. Coffee is freshly roasted on the premises. Where else can you get coffee served to you in a Bodum? Their Lattes are fantastic. not too milky and watered down like the big boys. You still get a little mud in yer cup! Their beans are great to take home and brew. mmmm Sumatra. BTW. they have a lot of gluten free items on their menu.,2
"Amazing! All I can say is fresh. The menu is in the smaller side, which ensures that everything is made fresh everyday. Soups, sandwiches, bread, pastries, breakfast sandwiches, coffee, all awesome. I have tried almost everything on the menu and would order any of it again. Favorite baguette in town and extremely reasonably priced.",2
"The food wasn't very memorable to me at all. I had the yellow curry but honestly nothing really stands out. There are so many better Thai restaurants in the area. Just a few that come to mind are Siri, Pin Kaow, and Naga. What I do remember is how cold it was in there. Really can't see myself coming back. There are just better options.",1
So I was craving wings n ordered a10piece well done light sauce and a ceaser salad. 17 delivery plus tip and 45 60 min delivery. Fine. the Guy showed up in 20min and the wings were under cooked microwave BS I can't believe it. I will never order from here again! Had to cook my wings in toaster oven for 20 min on 350. WTF. Seriously.,1
"Made a reservation and was told when I got there that the rate was actually 28 more resort fee for things I didn't want pool, internet, etc . What pisses me off was that they quoted me a rate on the internet, I paid the rate, and when I got there they demanded more money. My only recourse was to pay it or leave. It's fraud, plain and simple.",1
"this place is so yummy, i wish i had woken up earlier to get breakfast here everyday i was in vegas! i got the peach mango froyo and the hazelnut both very delicious. then i got the plain crepe, which comes with butter and whip cream. ohhh emmmm geeeee it was so good! i wish i had tried a waffle too!",2
"small and dark interior. there is a laundromat just down the street, so I always walk here. very busy location, inside and out and drive thru. huge staff is always very busy. It's only 2 stars because my frap was undrinkable, and I threw it away after returning to the laundromat. YUCK, was all icy and had some weird plastic taste.",1
"The server was friendly, but the food was horrible. The food took forever to come out nearly 30 mins . nI ordered the California Burger and fries. Fries were cold. Burger was bland. Lettuce was withered. My mom ordered buffalo wings. Salty and cold. Won't be going back. I rather drive all the way to Chandler.",1
"The grease needs to be changed! It's a dark brownish color, I know because it oozed out of the hash browns. n My moms a freak, we all know that, but they pushed her over the edge by not having drinks ready until after the food. It's serving 101, and the Sausage McGriddle is so tiny now! n The other McDonalds nearby are much better.",1
Temple is great because they have a huge patio that allows dogs! It also allows smokers which is a huge bummer. They should enforce a 50 feet away policy or something. The food is really good and service is almost always excellent. They have great happy hour prices and a friendly staff. We always have a nice time there.,2
"Went to Carlos 'n Charlies for Friday night drinks before going out. The patio was PACKED to capacity probably 300 400 people and the bar was staffed with TWO bartenders. Friends of mine waited 50 minutes to get service, I wasn't able to get anything from their bar. Their bar definitely has the capacity for 12 15 servers, I'm not sure why their management routinely understaffs the bar.",1
"My good buddy from New York took me here last night. Said I had to try the pastrami, pickles, and soup at this place. Said it was the best he has had in New York. You know what, he was right, this was one of the best pastrami sandwiches I've ever had. It is pricy but worth it. Also had the cherry cheesecake and it was incredible. One of the best I've had in a long time. I will be back for sure.",2
Great little place for a quick bite. Faster than table service but slower than fast food. The turkey Swiss was excellent. The baguette was my favorite so fresh and perfect. The pastry was delicious as well. This is inside the Paris casino hotel. I only wish we had checked this place out a day earlier for breakfast!,2
"We ate there on Friday around noon. Our first experience is mixed. Our choices included the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup and the lobster bisque. In addition I had the Thai mango chicken salad. Both soups had great flavors however, they were served lukewarm, at best. I do wish they would share their nutritional values for their food items.",2
"Beautiful collection of Native American artifacts. New exhibit on Indian schools is heartbreaking. Gorgeous collection of Hopi pottery and katsina dolls. Very up to date oew tribal names, correct spellings pronunciations, and current art jewelry. Enter from the rear of the building parking lot side. Needs better signage in courtyard and exterior areas.",2
"Best chinese food in Scottsdale. We used to go to Flo's and Jade's Place all of the time, but after always getting a stomach ache when eating at those places, we tried George Son's. We now only go to George Son's and probably get take or or eat there once a week. They use fresh ingredients and the food is not greasy like the other places.",2
Im a huge fan of someburros but this location has drastically lesser quality foid than others. My chicken taco had barely a tablespoon of chicken inside and my cheese crisp was literally cheese less! I asked for a new one at was glared at. Spending money on gas driving to another location is worth it.,1
"If Whole Foods had a classic post modern diner, this would be it. It takes all your classic American breakfast and lunch items and puts a HEALTHY and DELICIOUS without feeling guilty spin to it. The feel good food, the attentive service and the warm decor perfectly provides a nice respite from the STRIP SCENE. Only place in Vegas, you might have a zen experience.",2
Good dim sum in Las Vegas. Prices are reasonable and about the same as Orchids Garden dim sum. Food is good and they have a better selection on the carts than Orchids Garden. Only problems are limited parking because they are popular and the restaurant is about half the size of Orchids Garden and there can be a long wait for a table when they are busy. Never had this problem at Orchids Garden.,2
"Love this place for dessert. The macarons are so good, especially the salted caramel one! I recommend ordering a cake from here, check out their large cakes with macarons on it. So many desserts options to choose from. I just noticed they also have candy available. Stopped in for a croque monsieur this go around. Simple sandwich, nice cheeses. Heads up they are closed on Mondays.",2
"3 Words! Fantastic relaxation experience. Used the Yelp Promotion and did the 75 min foot reflexology and Ion Detox. Not only did they do my feet and legs, but I also got a shoulder and back rub. They offer you a nice herbal tea or water. I would highly recommend this place if you like strong foot reflexology.",2
"Having grown up in Chicago and enjoying all the great food there, I am hesitant when it comes to places that use the city as a gimmick in their name. This is not one of them. The menu is vast, and desirable. The gyros are among the best I have ever had. All of the food I saw looked great, and the people eating all looked very pleased. It's the type of place well worth going out of the way for.",2
"I enjoy the Red Mango yogurt, but they have done away with the unlimited toppings and gone with a new pricing scheme 75 u00a2 per topping, no matter how many toppings you choose . A small cup with two toppings now costs almost 5, which I think is too much. Red Mango yogurt without three or four different toppings just doesn't seem right!",1
Food was great servers were good but the manager was unacceptably rude. I figured after ordering 120 worth of food in this restaurant. And being the one who payed for it I would have been treated better. Not sure what his name was but he was taller with glasses and a receding hair line. I won't be going back to this place any more. At least not this location.,1
"Worst hotel you can stay at In Las Vegas, service sucks house keep and or engineering take a whole day to show up. Rooms are old as well as old nasty carpet. Don't do it! And the over charged us on after check out. Charged my girlfriends credit card extra 60 and mine had the same charge when I called for the money they denied everything. Good luck if you stay there. Don't do it word of advise.",1
"I've eaten here twice, both times accompanied by my children. While they made sure to set us away from the younger crowd, they didn't shove us next to the kitchen or in an unheated section which has been an issues at other restaurants . The food was very good and the service prompt. The menu is varied and isn't the same stuff, different bend you find in many places. We will be going back.",2
"Just finished a Friday Fish Fry at Babe's. I always forget about this place, but it's great if you're a sports Badger Packer Brewer fan. Fish was great. Their menu is diverse and the prices aren't crazy. Bar service was especially nice. Fish was well prepared, lots of options besides fries. Side salad served as an appetizer was more than just iceburg lettuce and it was fresh. We'll be back!",2
"I ordered a burrito and 2 tacos w rice beans. I was charged 20.85 for what I thought was a rip off. Looking at the chicken it appears like it's been sitting at room temperature all day. It's black, dry and old looking. They must think people are stupid and won't know the difference. It's harsh to say, but I could not finish a meal I purchased due to disgust.",1
Can't recommend this highly enough. nMy grandpuppy is a Maltipoo who hates being groomed and has been cut and traumatized by groomers elsewhere. nThe wonderful groomer at A Doggie in the Window gave Max times out during his grooming session so he could calm down. He came home happy and in beautiful shape.,2
"It seemed like my brisket should've tasted good, but it was swimming in sauce that they pour over it. The sauce was good and spicy, but sometimes I just want to taste the meat. My sides of macaroni and cheese, cole slaw, and cornbread really left much to be desired and really brought out the cafeteria quality of this place.",1
"4.8. can always be better but clearly my favourite croissants in Montreal so far! buttery, tasty, fluffy. almost perfect! PS I didn't try anything else there nothing looks really appealing to me. perhaps just a personal feeling because of the display of boulangerie and salads and macarons so close to each other ",2
"This was my last meal before I left for Chicago I'm beyond ANGRY! I ordered a dbl dbl no cheese, they add cheese tried to scrape it off but I still saw it tasted it. They drowned it in mustard to cover it up. DIDN'T WORK! The burger was also cold! My bun included. Then we ordered fries which were hard cold. This place has really ruined my last Vegas meal.",1
"Old traditional bar which has been around for a long time. n It tends to attract a slightly older crowd, who are much more interested in having good conversation than posing in an expensive George Street bar. n There's a coal fire in the winter, which is just the thing for thawing you out when you come in from the cold.",2
"I love water and I loved these fountains. It was breathtaking watching the show. We were in Vegas in August, 105 days. Watching the show gave us a nice mist that cooled us off for a few minutes. But man what a great free performance done by just a fountain! So cool. This is a must see if you have the time to walk over.",2
"I was referred here by Matt from Discount Tire and I am absolutely thankful that he did because the quality service and honest feedback from Rick was outstanding! Knowing that this place has competent mechanics and supreme customer service will definitely secure regular visits for any of my vehicles in the future. Thank you Rick, and thank you Matt Discount Tire West Flamingo ",2
"Rediculous! Was told there would be a 25 min wait, which was hard with our special need twins, but instead we waited over 45 minutes, meanwhile 2 tops were walking in being seated, spoke to the ""manager "" who was rude wasn't willing to put 2 tops together! Needless to say their food might be good but who cares with that wait attitude, you can get breakfast anywhere!",1
"I LOVE starting my day with the am crew! I feel almost bad if I don't see the great kids working at Dutch Bros because I had to stop and see my other fav coffee enabler. Knew me after my 1st trip and pointed out how I was super early that am. Friendly, outgoing, and even fast with lines at the lunchtime rush. Iced Annihilator FTW! Next time trying caramel added to my mac nut fix",2
"I guess I'm a non local hater who doesn't get it? It had so much hype that I was let down when my mind was not blown at all and instead I longed for the cheesesteaks I used to order from a greasy spoon down the street when I was in high school instead of what I was actually eating. I am a lifelong hater of coleslaw too, that probably didn't help.",1
I used to go here a lot but I went in today and I thought the threading was a bit more painful then usual but that aside. I left and looked in my car mirror and noticed I was bleeding! so angry I just spent so much money and I don't even feel smooth. and I got a cut on top of it. this place has gone down hill. good luck if you go here.,1
"Has really gone down hill lately. Very few dancers. Some were attractive. Saw guys came in and sit down for a few minutes, then leave since no dancers were on the stage most of the time. Service was spotty at best. I finally had to go to the bar, wait another several minutes, and then order the drink myself.",1
"Now fast food really shouldn't receive reviews but this place is so friendly with good, hot food! Once I waited in line for a good while and received a free 3 piece chicken fingers and the manager apologized. I was not upset but I am 24 and most people do not care about the younger crowd and only cater to older individuals.so I was very grateful.",2
"Good food but way too expensive. One single cheeseburger nGrilled cheese nMedium fry n2 small drinks n 19.50 Sure they over serve the fries, that's why there's only one medium. Really almost 10.00 each for my son and I. n 2.39 for a soda, come on. I know you have to pay for the fancy coke dispenser but really? nI Out burger almost half the price",1
The place feels like a really nice 100 yen store in Japan. Prices weren't bad for the stuff. Just look at it like an import fee. Picked up a few things we needed for the kitchen like a sesame seed grinder and long chopsticks for cooking. It was fun walking around having a laugh over the anime manga otaku stuff they had.,2
"Also known as ""Park Road Car Wash "". Just as good or better than auto bell and cheaper. Make sure to turn left after exiting the wash and have your car hand dried. If you bought super or interior cleaning this is also where you go. There's a little mailbox type container on the post if you want to leave a tip. Very friendly and diligent.",2
"This Is a great place to get some quality italian good without breaking the bank. With prices of their plates usually around 7, this is a great restaurant to go to if you want to get the most bang for your buck. Portion sizes are great and the quality if the food is also very good. Not super fancy or anything super special, but it is quality food at a great price.",2
The bait is 10 oil change.after that you will be called for other problem Sure thing it is their time to up sell cross sell. . Be prepared to say no and look for a second opinion from other places. I found O big tires even has better more reliable service. It is PURRFECT if you only stick to the 10 coupon. No more.,1
Nichole is wonderful! Been going to her for almost a year for my lash extensions. I get tons of complements on my beautiful lashes! She's always willing to listen to my ideas and suggests different lash products. Currently I have silk lashes and really like how they look. I appreciate the fact that she's very flexible when making appointments and works around my schedule.,2
"Took over an hour to for our lunch to reach the table and they weren't even that busy. The waiter said sorry and offered us free bread. The food is ok, but I cant take the chance of going again and waiting another hour at the table for our food to show up especially in this city where theres a million other choices out there.",1
"First time trying Cuban food, so that was fun to try something new. Other than that, there was nothing to really rave about. The wait staff did not seem thrilled to be there, people had little kids acting up in the tiny restaurant and the tables are on top of each other, so cell phone conversations took away from the experience too. Not sure I would go again, but glad we finally gave it a try.",1
"This place changed owners a couple of years ago. I went a couple of times after the owner change. The decor changed a little. Service was friendly but honestly everything was not nearly as good. I was pretty disappointed. Rice was too warm, rolls were falling apart not the same, sashimi was not that good. I never came back. Oh well, it was great while it lasted.",1
"Service I received was even worse, although I think it all depends on which server you get. My waitress was very much lost. First she took my order. She came back to repeat my food order. She returned later to ask what drink I ordered. After a minute she asked again what food I ordered. Kicker is, food was barely a notch above Taco Bell, only way overpriced.",1
This company put out a Living Social deal for a deep clean on a house and have received many many purchases. Since I am moving out of my house I bought the deal and have called twice every day to schedule my appointment. They have not once answered the phone or returned any of my messages. I have 2 days left to cancel my purchase and will be doing so promptly after this posts.,1
"Sir Ed's always delivers. I got there in the middle of trivia but I was able to get a spot at the bar. I finally ordered the fish and chips and washed it down with a Port City Porter. The only thing really working against this place is how it's so hidden. There are signs on the front side of the shopping center, but I didn't feel like navigating stairs and my friend was having problems finding me.",2
"The big greasy bag of fries may make you wince at first.but let me tell ya they're pretty damn good! Good, fresh burgers and fries. A TON of fries. Really, I don't NEED all those fries! But I'll eat them. Oh yes, I will. The only thing that would make this place better? A drive thru! But really, I don't need that either. Getting out of my car and walking inside .ah yes, what a grueling workout!",2
"One of the best sandwich shops I have ever visited. And I have visited a lot! This place makes most Subway Restaurants look very amateurish and disappointing. The sandwiches are exceptional, quality as good as it gets, and the level of service is beyond what a business like this should be expected to deliver. I highly recommend Firehouse Subs. Once you try this place, you will go back.",2
"Wow wow wow! Wonderful place with all suites. Suite had a small downstairs that led to a big couch pull out bed. Hotel itself is well kept, though crowded. Restaurants and shopping for those of you who don't gamble, and connected to Palazzo for those of you who like to gamble everywhere. Highly recommended!",2
"Best Thai in the valley. Also best lunch buffet. Daily except on Saturdays. A must try place. I frequent this place more than any other restaurant. It is also very close to where I live. Pete is one the nicest people you can know. I would eat here several times a week but cooking is a hobby of mine! If you can't make up your mind, ask. They always give expert advice.",2
"Service A . Food A . If you are looking for some legit Italian food that is amazing and delicious, this is the spot! The meatballs made of Filet Mignon literally melt in your mouth, and our server John was a doll with an Italian accent. The entire staff made us feel welcome and took good care of us. For an affordable and delicious meal I highly recommend!",2
"My child is taking summer classes there right now, she is 4 and loves it! I hadn't been to the museum before this but plan on it after classes are over.The staff is so friendly and professional with the kids. Its been a great experience so far and we will keep coming back! The classes are a tad pricy but worth it and there was a discount for taking all of the classes.",2
" ""The kitchen won't let me substitute fruit for potatoes. "" So began our dining experience at The Aria's Cafe Vettro. It is in par with other soulless food places like Denny's or IHOP , where food functions as necessity instead of experience. Another disappointing way to spend 50 for an otherwise 5 meal in Las Vegas.",1
"Service was good. Food was ok. I would order from some other place. nOrdered orange chicken and General Tsao' s chicken they looked the same. Orange chicken was bland and covered in a very thick sayce. The General's was dry and not spicy at all. The cream cheese ragoon were not edible. The sweet and sour sauce is from a jar or a can. On the positive side, the wo ton were crispy and fresh.",1
"I love this place for lunch or a casual happy hour when I am in town. The Chips are amazing. They are not your typical tortilla chips. Every basket has a sweet, spicy and regular flavor. The food will not WOW you but then again this is a laid back tex mex restuarant with good margarita's decent food but a really good atmosphere!",2
"Coming from NYC I was ready for what this place had to offer. I ordered the whole chicken, tapsilog breakfast, Pancit bihon, beef soup, stir fry beef, milkfish breakfast, garlic rice, fried calamari. Out of all these dishes the calamari sucked, they should just stop serving it. Everything else was really good, especially the tapsilog.",2
Awesome experience. Location is super close. The pho was delicious. Not a fav of the Vietnamese sandwich. It didn't have a lot of the pickled veggies and the pate is chicken. I believe the sandwich I had in Chinatown had pork pate. The marinated grilled pork was a highlight. The server was friendly and answered all my questions. I didn't feel intimidated at all.,2
"The food is SO good but I literally ALWAYS get awful service! I complained to management for the awful and rude server we had, they respond and apologize and also offered to comp our next meal but it just has not become worth it to me considering there are plenty of other GREAT pizza places around town that also have awesome and friendly service.",1
We were looking for a cleaning company with a good reputation and fair pricing. Noble Cleaners is who we found and recommend. Gene and his crew showed up exactly on time ready to work. They cleaned every piece of carpet and went the extra way to steam clean my tile and entry. Hands down the best professional cleaning service I have experienced. Great Job!,2
"I think this place is great, especially since the new owners took over. Maria and Albino are almost always around to greet you and they're warm and friendly. Good drink GREAT MARGARITAS! and very good traditional food. Big portions too for those of us getting tired a restaurants that treat Mexican food like it's nouvelle cuisine. Great place. Thanks guys.",2
"This place is absolutely AMAZING! The food taste great and you get huge portions and the prices are lower than most places. It is very clean and has a comforting layout. It gets pretty packed at night with all of the ASU kids, so I enjoy going there for lunch or an early dinner so i can beat the crowd. They also have great drink specials and daily food specials as well. Overall, AWESOME place!",2
"Stayed here for 2 weeks while the house was getting worked on. The stay was excellent. The workers are very friendly, and the pool is very clean. The only hotel that my parents and I came back to after searching for one closer to the house. Excellent stay for the price, and easily one of the best motels we stayed at.",2
If you claim to be a foodie you have to try this place. The location of the restaurant is questionable but it makes it a neighborhood gem. Ask you server what they recommend and enjoy being transported to Europe! The service was fast and excellent. Take a look at the beer selection as well. Personally I recommend the Hungarian Goulash!,2
"Made the mistake of visiting on a Saturday night. Dear lord, it was crowded. Narrow hallways and weird seating arrangements made me very uncomfortable and a tiny open area for dancing was just throbbing with sweaty people bumping around. The bouncers were rude and harsh.the whole experience was just unpleasant.",1
Normally I only go for the sesame chicken when I have Chinese food. While this wasn't the worst food I have ever had it was far from the best. The coating on the chicken was very spongy and the flavor was so so. The good thing was you could at least identify the chicken as white meat. Would probably not go back. Still waiting to find sesame chicken in goodyear that's any good.,1
"Horrible customer service! If they treated someone who was just trying to very an employee's work status then GOD only knows how they would treat a possible client or tenant. I would move on, the girls in their office reflect their business and obviously they employee people who don't care to be a positive outlook for their company.",1
"One of the worse dining experiences I've ever had. Our ""waiter "" gregorio, screwed up every aspect of our meal, including not splitting our check properly as requested, and mixing the receipts up afterwards. Then today I realized that he double charged us for our meal and tip. Now we have to deal with getting our extra back. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.",1
"Banzo is the best restaurant in Madison. I wish I could give it a sixth star. It isn't anything fancy, and the pitas stuffed with enormous falafel balls can almost be difficult to eat, but the experience is completely justified by how delicious everything tastes. You can tell they pride themselves on the fresh ingredients and authentic flavors. I probably eat here at least once or twice a month.",2
"I love Tea Time Cafe! My personal favorites are Coconut Milk Tea and Thai Tea with boba. Location is great because where I live, it takes about twenty minutes for me to get boba from china town which suuuuuucks. The staff that work there are super nice and since I go here on a daily basis, they already know what drink I want ",2
"My wife and I just ate here for lunch based on a recommendation from a local. This is one of the worst buffets I've tried in Vegas. The food was less than mediocre, and in most cases barely edible. Breads were stale and dry, flavors of most things seemed bland and cheap, and a platter of ""fresh "" burgers just put out were already cold. Avoid this buffet and spend your money elsewhere!",1
"Thee best AYCE sushi! You can literally have ANYTHING on their menu no restrictions. Cost nfor lunch time ayce 20.95 perso nWhat's good n seafood salad mild or spicy MUST HAVE n no name roll MUST HAVE n deep fried mussels n green mussels n sun of the beach No bueno n plum ice cream tastes like medicine n grand canyon, or golden canyo anything with cooked salmon on top salmon is dry",2
"Just saw an episode of ""kitcheightmares "" where a hair was found in the food and Ramsay shut down the whole place reminded me of my nightmare at Kona with the hair and all I was offered was a free dessert. That was 2 years ago no response from the review ever. Shitty management have not been back since .",1
"Meh. I've been to Jersey Mike's once and only once. I personally help to keep Subway in business and Jersey Mike's didn't steal me away. Like someone mentioned, the sizes of sandwiches is pretty odd. I got a 5 inch. turkey sub and some chips and a drink. The ingredients were good, don't get me wrong, but it all just tasted a little bland. Probably won't go back.",1
" 's fun authentic atmosphere decor, outdoor patio, cheap food, free chips salsa at beginning, free sopaipillas at end 's chips salsa ok, as well as the food however, this food is pretty authentic If you are in downtown Scottsdale and want a fun, cheap, authentic Mexican place I'd chose Frank Lupe's over Los Olivos, El Molino's, or Julio's.",2
"Took two of my dogs here. Both bichon mix and was really happy with Anthony's job. Funny bit my mom was complimenting one of my doggies as she was being brought out, completely unaware that it was actually our Roxy, even saying she'd wish our doggy looked like her. it wasn't until she was told it was our doggy that she took in the great job Anthony did. Thank you bunches.",2
"Professional, attentive staff. A nice location and all of the services one could hope for, at affordable prices. Lipo, Botox, saphenous vein removal. I haven't been a patient, but my girlfriend has and she loves Dr. Vajtai pronounced Voy Tay and his staff. And since I write the reviews.here ya have it!",2
Went for lunch and was impressed with how express their lunch menu was. The server made me feel like I was bugging him a bit at first but was friendly once I was leaving maybe telling him how good it was helped my case too! . The salad was super boring but the jerk chicken was really tasty. A great find for an escape from work at lunchtime.,2
"I love this place. It's been around since Jesus was a child. The food is amazing for the price. I had Steak Egg's with Hash Browns, OJ Coffee for 9. The steak was tender and rare just the way I like it. My go to place whenever I'm in Vegas. Warning If you're bothered by cigarette smoke, you may want to avoid but if you can handle it, the food is so worth it.",2
"Reserved a full size. ""Gave "" us a Honda ""Accord "". Got down to the lot and it was a Civic. Had to go back to the desk and they made us wait while they borrowed an Altima from Hertz. Should have told us from the start instead of hoping we weren't going to notice. For shame, not the way to do business. nCharged us for prepaid gas which I declined. Caveat emptor if you are drawn in for the price.",1
"This super cuts is the most worthless group of ""stylists "" ever. The people who work here are slow and lazy. They spend more time talking to each other and idling around while customers are waiting for a haircut, it's ridiculous. The ""call ahead "" feature is a joke. My boys go here for a simple cut, but we will not go to this location anymore",1
"Worst service I ever got in a classy restaurant like this.When my glass of water was empty they didn't even offer to refill it.When I finished my meal they didn't ask if I wanted desert, but they did ask the guests at surrounding tables if they wanted it.Everything is priced separately.Food was good but because of the service ,I will never go back there again.",1
Didn't know about this beauty til one of my bosses friends told us about it we got a great deal on their website the staff were very nice and the housekeeper was super helpful and friendly! I am definitely staying here again for my birthday weekend! I would recommend this place if you prefer something quiet and right by the strip along with not your typical casino hotel this is the RIGHT place!,2
"Great ambience, the waiter was super friendly Alexandro. I had the tuna burger and poutine. The burger was good. I was not expecting it to be cold but it was delicious. The poutine was better than the average . I prefer the BBQ sauce than the standard poutine. Sweet potato fries are addictively yummy . And the owner is super friendly and free desserts",2
"Two words Beer Pong Two more words Pissing Contest some random coin operated device above the urinal O'Friggin shea's! Thanks for taking 200 off me at the craps table and for having Miller High Life on tap! This place has a good vibe and some good times. Of course, you already know about this place so you don't need me to tell you.",2
"The place is ran by idiots. I get there and only one in line but the cashier sees me and continues to use a little brush to take crumbs off the device right behind the cashier station. Finally she FINISHED, so then asks if I'm ready. Asked to get a bagel and they couldn't toast it. What? The week before they didn't have the tea made. The manager during the evenings is not on the ball.",1
"All I can say is YUM! Nothing starts my day like a cup of nectar of the gods from Dutch. It's got a great taste without the burned taste of Starbucks. The carmelizer is probably my favorite, but the black white mocha is a close second. Be sure to sign up for the text club, as they email out deals every week. Tuesday is also double stamp day. ",2
"Great local spot! Recommended by my old college roommate and he was right on the mark. Great service, very nice people, great little bar downstairs and the food was excellent. The sea bass was fantastic. Their warm sourdough bread is fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone I'm going back the next time I'm in Madison.",2
"I went here with my hubby. You know me. I can't touch the meat, because of my cholesterol so I was going to get sides. Guess what friends that was not an easy task. Couldn't get a veggie burger either, but I ate some beans and a tea. Everything was just ok. Not great. Not horrible either. The problem is you can get better choices elsewhere for a lot less money. ",1
"This is separate not the same owners as the Ray McQueen location and the Warner and McClintock.has to be because the method of making the deep dish pie was totally different and even the crust was different. Cheese on top, so it was OVERDONE. No where near as good as the pie at the original dine in location at Ray McQueen. If you are craving deep dish from Rosati's, go to Ray McQueen.",1
"Chestnut just doesn't care. Being the new kid on the block and set in a gorgeous location, Chestnut doesn't have to work hard. And it shows. My friend and I were excited to go to the hot new spot and left super disappointed. Read about our ordeal here http www.nickialanoche.com 2014 01 30 do not go to chestnut fine foods and provisions in phoenix ",1
"OK, it's greasy, it's got burned coffee, it's filling and all at Las Vegas prices. It does alright in a pinch, but if you can manage to go someplace else, please do. On my own, I'd eat here and not complain, but if you're with somebody else, say your wife who is much less tolerable than yourself when it comes to greasy food and burned coffee, you might want to venture out.",1
This is simply horrible barbecue. They actually should not even tell people that they barbecue here because they just cook ribs and things in the oven and give you a whole bunch of sauce to cover it with. I would highly recommend avoiding this place if you're looking for serious BBQ. I have heard that their sandwiches are decent,1
"This was somewhere between 2 3 stars. My tickets for the show were free and I did actually enjoy myself. However, the show itself needs some work. While some of the segments were quite good, there were others that didn't hold my interest and it did not flow smoothly from one part to another. nI think this show has a ways to go before it can hold its own against the other shows on the Strip.",1
"I've given this place all the shots that I can. Twice before, I've experienced bad service and mediocre food at best. This time, meh, service was meh, food was atrocious. I've had a better salad at McDonald's. Three times was supposed to be the charm, and maybe it really is. I won't be going back, and that's the good thing.",1
"I was very surprised by the overall rating of this hotel. I'm a local and I think it's gorgeous, as well as modern but also vintage at the same time. And really people, the ceiling does not matter. I like that they made it all black at least. The restaurants look so nice and trendy. It's like having a little piece of LA right here in Vegas. I will be staying here soon!",2
OK this is overrated! nBobby Flay has more fame than culinary abilities! nNothing we tried was memorable. nService was friendly yet nothing to remember. nThe decor is fun and location is great. nFor the money spent I think there are many much better places to go in Vegas than here. Do not think I will be back. nGood luck Bobby!,1
"I didn't love 131 on my first visit, but lately I can't get enough! It has a great atmoshpere and the thing I love the most is they change their menu each season. This is brilliant for this area, you can only eat at the restaurants in blakeny so many times before you tire of them. 131 keeps you coming back to see what they have changed! Excellent food, excellent service!",2
"Big fan of Jet Blue. Commuting from Long Beach to Vegas is very convenient. Love the you can select your seat prior and they provide Direct TV, water soda and snacks. My flight from Long beach to Vegas, the TVs didn't work, but it was a 45 min flight, I decided to read. no biggie. nLas Vegas airport is alright, slots everywhere.",2
"Really great spot for burgers. The burgers are really tasty and I loved the garlic fries. The owner I think means really well, but the service is SO slow. I'm fine with running next door to swipe cards, but I had to get up and ask for water several times we're in a desert! . Maybe it's time to hire someone, it's a good thing!",2
"This is definitely an old school hang out with a classic menu. Although my steak was cooked perfectly, I can't speak to the quality of the ingredients as they lacked natural flavour of meat and fish that I love. My biggest gripe, though, would be the overcooked scallops. If you are an adventure Eater or like common things cooked in uncommon ways, I would skip this one.",1
"After obsessively comparing reviews of Phoenix pizza restaurants, my husband and I decided to go to Lamp. Great Decision! The service was exceptional our waiter was helpful without being overbearing. I had the Geppetto pizza which was heavenly. Carmelized onion marmelade? Yum! We're only in town for a week but will be visiting Lamp again before we leave!",2
Only go here if you smoke CIGARETTES lots of them! Holy crap I've never been in such a smoke filled bar. This place is a nightmare for a non smoker 10X worse than any Casino in Vegas. Yes the drinks are really strong but the STENCH in there is so not worth it! I can't believe no one mentions the smoke in this place. Yuck!,1
"I usually am a fan of Moe's for chain southwestern food! I'd just recommend a different location like the one in the Northlake area. For a Moe's I was incredibly disappointed with this location. The staff were grumpy, the soda machine was out of ice I guess the machine breaks randomly? , and they were out of tofu.",1
"My experience with most AYCE sushi restaurants is that it's just average sushi, with subpar fish, this place is no different. Their eel sauce is way too sweet making any roll it's served on taste like a desert roll, I wasn't impressed by the quality of fish being served. I've definitely had worse, but I've definitely had better.",1
Brian surprised us yet again tonight with a meal for two people with dessert as he walked into my store. I wasn't expecting anything! He is such an awesome owner and the meal was amazing. Noodles with sauteed vegetables and feta on the side. Garlic bread and fat bottomed girls. Thank you Brian you're amazing!,2
Customer service was horrible the cashier was being so rude forgot to charge us for the drinks that I clearly told her I wanted. Then she came back and told us that we need to pay for them if we want them. Well duh! I didn't expect free drinks because of your mistake. The food was dry and flavorless I've heard so many good things about this restaurant and I came out really disappointed.,1
"Very Very Very Beautiful Hotel on the Strip. I rarely go to Vegas, but when i do, i make sure to go to the Bellagio, to check out the Flower Display. I have yet to stay at the Bellagio since it's so EXPENSIVE, but i can understand, a Fountain Musical in the Front, and a Topiary inside. No Casino except the Mirage is a beautiful scenery wise on the strip",2
"I have had a lot of luck at this Coffee Rush location! The coffee is always good, the staff is almost always friendly. The setting is a bit hipster, but what coffee shop isn't these days? I like the little punch cards they give you, although I have a tendency to lose them. An app would be a bit easier to me. All in all, this location of Coffee Rush is enjoyable ",2
"To start off, I got food poisoning . I was up all night puking all of my food up. I mean the food might be disgusting but the service was devastating, it took hours order. That night I saw vermon in the restaurant and threw up violently that night. It was the worst and I will never dine at firefly again.",1
"Their food gave me and my boyfriend diarrhea. Talked to someone at work, and they experienced the same thing. Oh, and it was overpriced 4 for a single pancake? come on. and not that tasty. Easily the worst ""chorizo "" i've ever had. Biscuits were bad. Service was good though. Very friendly and attentive. But nothing can make up for the day of misery which ensued.",1
"I just LOVE this place. I remember the very first time I ate here. it was very good. The last three times I stayed Palazzo, me and my family basically ate Grand Lux Cafe every meal we were there for 3 or 4 days. This place has been consistent with their service, taste presentation of food, and price.",2
"Very good Mexican food nWe recoment the nacho's lunch order was more than we could eat. We shared an order. nwe had eaten there year ago. We would eat there as regulars but we are from Florida. nCarolyn our very good and helpful server said the lunch order came all decked out, the dinner Nachos are chips and cheese or build your own. nLunch for 2 was 13.48.",2
"The inside looked much better than the outside. It has a nice quaint setup, but they need some work on atmosphere. AC was a bit cold and the lighting was very dim. The food was fine, but the wait is very long. They told us everything was made from scratch, but I think that is code for ""expect a long wait. "" Price is high and I left still hungry. My vote, look elsewhere for Thai food.",1
Borders is going out of business. Let me advise you that the sign says from 10 40 off. I saw greeting cards that were 40 off but I don't recall seeing greeting cards in the store previously. There were some textbook like books on sale for 30 off but primarily children's books and everything else was 10 off. This looks like one of those going out of business let's sell you some other stuff sales.,1
"First, the place was dead. As iot a soul in sight other than some burnout sitting at the bar. Secondly, our waitress was a complete and utter jerk and that's as lightly as I can put it. Thirdly, put a door handle on the front door so people don't stand there trying to figure out how to get in the bar you dimwits.",1
Gross how can anyone serve food from a pig pen! I would not feed my dogs from this nasty so called restaurant! With employees acting like it was high school running all over the manager! This place is a health hazard with the back having food everywhere! Amd mike the guy on the register giving food away to his friends making paying customers feel like he was doing us a favor for taking my order!,1
Don taco hooks it up fat and at great prices. Bean and cheese burrito 2.70 yep and big. This is the go location. It's on of the only ones that isn't attracted to a bar so when you go late at night you do have to deal with a line of drunks from the bar. I moved but still come to this location over the closer one.,2
"This place is awesome! The food was delicious and the beers were just as amazing. We tried the Justin, Mountain Burger, Oysters, Lumpia FAVORITE , and the Shepards pie none of which disappointed and was like a party for my taste buds. Will be for sure frequenting this place when I next visit Phoenix from LA.",2
We go here often and usually it is great! Today so bad never again. We waited on ourselves! We got our own silverware.had to ask for service were forgetten. We told the manager who did not seem to care. We got our bill after going asking for it. When our change was brought it was someone else's check. If you want awful service this is the place to go!,1
"Cheese curds.yum. The custard, extra yum. The service, almost always great. Today the cashier was a bit of a snot. The fried chicken was the show stopper today. I would have never guessed you can get chicken that good there. AND the fries are the ONLY fries offered by a national chain that gives McDonald's any competition.",2
"Hongfu offers an excellent range of dishes io nonsense surroundings. Portions are generous, dishes are well executed, with the Mongolian beef, and mountain chicken proving particular favourites, with our party. Overall, we think Hongfu has solid claims on being one of the best restaurants of its type in Edinburgh.",2
"Born and raised in Phoenix, first time at Mel's Diner. We stopped for breakfast on our way back to Tucson. The staff was friendly and efficient. The meal was fresh, House Fries were homemade, not frozen. Pancakes were light and fluffy. We spent a little less than we would at IHOP and the food was much better. We'll definitely return to Mel's Diner.",2
"We sat there and watched 3 people have 3 turns singing while we got looked over every time even after the crowd loved our first songs even to the point of standing in front of our table singing along and high five so I guess u can't go here and be over 40 because if so, the karaoke host will ignore u like u don't exist",1
"The surliness and thievery committed by the Phoenix based TSA employees really ruin PHX Sky Harbor from being a traveler Friendly Airport. This is also the same airport that kills drunk housewives! I use this airport weekly and have had numerous gear stolen by TSA employees at checkpoint C. Stolen items include portable hard drives, laptop batteries, USB drives and an LCD Projector.",1
"I've been at marquee in 3 opportunities, this club is a Truly ""Wow Factor, "" that has changed entirely Las Vegas nightlife. With 62,000 square foot, ultra high tech, 40 foot LED screen, located in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. This multi level venue has Outside a pool area inspired by Tao Beach, if you're in vegas, you must visit marquee, you wont be disappointed.",2
"This place is beat. It's the size of a normal Ross, but has way less than half of the stock of a normal Ross. It just looks picked over and sad. I dont understand what's going on here. Are they going out of business? Clearing for new inventory? Stocking up for the Zombie Apocalypse? Who knows. Never returning.",1
"Went a couple days ago with some friends. Not a big gun guy but it was awesome. I shot the G36. I felt like Tom Cruise in mission impossible 3. Always been a fan of that gun since seeing the movie and finally got to experience it. Staff was patient and didn't make me feel like an idiot, which I am when it comes to guns.",2
"Think superlative food smoked pork hock, sticky browned succulent pig tails, Weiner schnitzel and ribs washed down or slowly savoured with house brewed Bavarian style beer. If you are not a swine lover, no worries, they also serve beef, chicken, and seafood the trout dinner is another tried and trusted good dish Friendly and prompt service, despite sometimes seemingly large crowd.",2
gross. period. went to bellagio buffet years ago when it first opened and remembered it was really good. had not been there since then so hubby and i decided to try it on our recent trip to vegas and totally regretted it. the food looked gross and tasted gross and i'm not even a picky eater! let's just say this is the first time i left a buffet hungry.,1
"Are you serious, people? First of all, this place is now called Sushi Tower, which makes no sense to me at all. We didn't end up eating here. The place just lacked any sense of atmosphere and they tried seating us next to a family with a kid who was jumping up and down in the booth. We politely excused ourselves and headed out the door.",1
My girlfriends and paid to take a photo in the photo booth and the camera was turned to the wall. I asked 4 different people to help us or at least give us a refund and every person told me to ask someone else for help. After waiting over 20 mins we gave up. Extremely upset with the horrible customer services.,1
"A nice joint with high tables, provided that you like TVs in every direction I assume a good place to watch sport. Foodwise, it's not very impressive. My pulled pork tacos were not bad, but they were bland. The beer menu is decent, but not very large so I went for a dogfish . I may be back, perhaps for a drink.",1
"been there at least twenty time and haven't had any service bad enough to remember. Steaks are always cooked properly. I get med rare, my wife gets well done which is a challenge for many places. One of the managers always stops by to check if everything went well. Be sure to ask about their frequent diner card.",2
"I don't get these other reviews. The atmosphere is a little dated but the food is great. They have some really wonderful specialty rolls. We have always found the staff friendly and fun even taking several shots of saki with us . i can honestly say my wife and i have tried 95 of all sushi restraints on the North side of town and enjoy Sushi Sage the best, scan bet the food and price.",2
"Absoultely love this place ! This review is only for the bar area. Every time i'm in vegas i have to make a quick stop at this bar. The tamarindo margarita is my favorite ! However, if you want to do a good meal you have to try the tablita, which has grilled steak chicken carnitas and 4 different salsa beans and rice. it is more then enough for 2 4 people. So delicious i highly recommend.",2
"A great, small place to stop by and enjoy Vietnamese food. The sweet sauces and large amount of meat should curve your protein cravings. I was surprised at the amount of meat served, which I am glad to box up for a snack later. nSeems fresh and priced right for Surprise AZ. Calamari is a must here. I have never had the soups etc. I go here for the meat plates and Calamari which I recommend.",2
"Maybe we went on a bad night. The drinks were really expensive, the flair bartenders were not impressive and it was so loud my boyfriend and I could not even have a conversation. The drunk older women on the dance floor were hilarious though. There are so many better places to go to when in Vegas, we left about about 15 minutes. NEXT!",1
"The service sucked. Our waitress took our order and we never saw her again. We had to wave down another waiter to see if we could get our check and he said our waitress went on her break.I waited tables for years, Who the hell goes on a break when you have a table? The food was okay, service was slow.",1
"This review is for a venue in the Hard Rock, nJacque Lu Cont. did a 45 minute set opening for PSB! His set was amazing! Then the show I came to see The Pet Shop Boys did a show for almost two hours long! nWhat an amazing show! They did there old stuff from the 80 90 and tons of remixes,what an amazing show! nWOW! To say the least! nMy mind was blown.",2
"The menu is short and sweet. But I bet you cannot go wrong with anything! We started with the miso soup, shushito peppers with miso sauce yum! . Had three kinds of their specialty sushis so fresh and such play of flavors! And lastly the wagyu beef ribs with foie gras melts in your mouth! Sauce is so divine! Sake to complete. Lovely restaurant. Awesome fusion. Attentive staff. Worth the ",2
"Nice atmosphere, live music, If your a wine buff it's great too. Food was good. I ordered a chicken breast and got something that looked like a wing. They gave me some fancy name for the breast but I was disappointed. Salmon was excellent however ""sticky purple "" rice was awful. Service was excellent.",2
"I walked in and felt like a kid in a beer errr candy store. I have never seen so many beers on draft. I was salivating just looking at them all. I ordered the devil eggs as a ""snack "" and the crab cake sandwich for my meal. Everything was really tasty. I'll definitely be going back to try more of their extensive menu and try every beer they have on tap.",2
"Finally, a bakery that makes healthy, gluten free muffins that honestly taste good! My favorite was the Sweet Potato Pumpkin. Tastes just like pumpkin pie in a muffin. There was also a good selection of other low fat, gluten free and vegan products such as cheese cakes, cookies, and nut butters with healthy, amazing ingredients. The staff was super nice and gave us several free samples.",2
"Sure, slap a handy man in the middle of a fully kitted electrical shop and it becomes a useful tool. But charge over u00a31.40 for a measly light bulb are you render that handyman a thief. My limited knowledge of all things fuses and wattage was clearly exploited by these guys and thus my impression of the place is not the best. I'd been robbed.",1
"I don't know how people in Vegas can call this nasty shit ""food "". Seriously, are all of your taste buds dead and everything tastes like cardboard? Wish I could give a negative rating, because not only is there bad food, but they put religious tracts on their cups. At least they did last time I was there. Disgusting. Save your money and go to Fatburger or Grind.",1
"These guys specialize in the lighter roasts, and they serve their pour overs on a plank of wood, in a small pitcher, allowing the customer to pour the coffee themselves, as they see fit. Beautiful. nAs to the coffee, I prefer a bit of a stronger pour, but they do a good job. Their Cappuccino is nearly spot on, though a bit hotter would be nice. Otherwise, perfect.",2
"Thanks to Top Notch for providing transportation during our entire stay in Scottsdale. Each time we utlized the service they were timely, dependable, and professional. Clean cars sweet SUVs and towncars and comprable pricing make this my choice for getting around AZ in style. They live up to their name and truly provide ""top notch "" service. Wooohooo to Top Notch.",2
"wasn't really impressed with the burgers, felt like they were trying way too hard to be something different, its a burger place, provide quality meat and buns and you're all set! Don't try to re invent the wheel! Decently priced though so its worth to check out at least once to say you have done it. Get the jalapeno poppers!",1
"OMG I dropped off my 400 b macousky black bag for re stitch the lining one week ago. Came back 1 week to the day to pick it up. they LOST IT. 400 out. 10 for repair and no bag. Do not trade with these thieves. Reported to police and BBB. Do not trade shoe repair or anything with these people. You might not get it back. And they don't care if they go to small claims court. So she, owner, said.",1
"Not up to LA Fitness standards, or worth your money. I only go here because I live within walking distance, and I usually regret it. The facility is old, machines are old, and half the time it's dirty. And tonight I noticed ants crawling all over the locker room. Do yourself a favor, drive to one of the two on camelback.",1
"The burger was the best I've ever had, had the Poblano. Everything from the pretzel bun to the meat and toppings was top notch. Unfortunately I waited 35 minutes for my food during a slow period, the service was abysmal. But, I will be back for the burgers. If not for the service, would have been five stars.",2
"AH MAZING! Was here for my bff's wedding and she had the ceremony and reception there. Loved every single minute of it! Service they bend over backwards to help you with anything nFood Top notch stuff highlights was the mushroom puff pastry appetizer, cheese puff, beurre blanc sauce, steak with carmelized onion. Def. give this a chance, you won't be disappointed.",2
don't order from them! bad service had me wait 45 mins and have half my order wrong had me wait another 45 mins to bring the rest of my food! this is the most horrible experince ivr ever had ordering food from a restaurant! it's good to know that they'll be out of business in the next few months. places like this don't last long.,1
"I love a great coffee and I'm so glad that I found a place close to home where I can come and enjoy some fresh roasted not bitter or burned java . Always friendly and helpful, not to mention the awesome courtyard to sit and read in or listen to some live music on Fridays and Saturdays. It's been a very convenient place for me to have meetings or hang out with friends.",2
"Just came in from a road trip wanting some ramen, so we stopped in. My husband insisted I try their name sake, fukumimi ramen, egg, pork belly, noodle, green onions, and broth! I thought it was good, I liked the combination of ingrediates and the broth was rich and seasoned well! Good service good food!",2
Harrison was our server he kicked ass. RR Gourmet Burger 8.99 w GF bun 1. Bottomless allergen free fries cooked in a separate fryer. They also ask you how you'd like your burger med or well done. Beautiful art decor on the walls and ceiling. Fantastic service. This is a location I would go out of my way for in the future. Thanks for the great GF options!,2
"NEVER go for anything other than a hangnail. Then make sure your manicurist goes with you! Didn't follow through with test ordered. Would not admit error. I'm not sure what medical schools these Drs graduated from but coming from a medical family, wouldn't let my dog go there if I had one . I'll make sure to pay any co pay the same way they followed through with my tests.",1
waited 45 minutes for nachos we never got. asked to close out and the manager informed us someone else probably ate them. he offered to get us something else but my time is more valuable. sucks because their food is actually pretty good but the complete lack of any experience and common sense is evident in the staff.,1
"i've had some of the best thia food in the bay area and la. this was my first thai food in the lv area. the food was bland and the ""hot "" wasn't hot. i'll keep looking for a better spot in the meantime. the staff was really friendly and the prices aren't too bad. if i wasn't exposed to good thai food this might have beeen a better experience.",1
"We started off with a basket of artisan bread and then shared a very good Caesar salad. Our entr u00e9e was a mammoth sized ribeye plus we ordered a colossal baked potato that our server split for us. The ribeye was both tender and flavorful, but the baked potato was too well done. We used a 50 certificate that I previously purchased from a radio station.",2
First time visitor today. Loved the store. Huge. So much to see. Even games to play. The cafe food was good. The staff absolutely pleasant and so helpful. Hubby and I spent almost 2 hrs at store. Couldn't buy any weaponry since we're not from AZ but found great little gifts oh and some delicious fudge.,2
"Horrible service. Ordered online and there was no verification that a 1 hour wait was ok. No way to cancel. Actually too 1 35 minutes, was cold, undercooked wings, pizza wasn't even fully cut needed a knife . Called to complain and all the manager said was that it got a little crazy. We'd be crazy to go back.",1
"I have confirmed the rumors that Big Wong will be closing before the end of the year. The owners have been locked in to a lease they assumed for the last 15 years and with the down turning economy aren't able to continue. If you want a very reliable meal in a super friendly environment, rush on over before they close their doors forever. ",2

"This is fast becoming our favorite fast food place. If we want a sit down full service experience, then it is Lindo Michocan. If it is fast food, then forget taco bell, del taco or chipotle, it is Taco y Taco. It has a variety of meats and styles of street foods that you would see in Mexico, at a reasonable price. Well we return? Of course it is close to the house and GOOD!",2
"Very busy but clean mall. Love that high end retailers are mixed in with your average retail stores. Makes shopping fun and exciting for the unsuspecting mall shoppers. Tons of options for restaurants. nOn the weekends, there is even a Fashion Show on the hour, every hour showcasing one of the hundreds of clothing stores.",2
"Rude, rude, rude. The clerk today was put out by my business. My fiance warned me but I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. She failed to greet me didn't want to count the items delivered 2 pieces of disappointing news with a look and a tone that spoke volumes TOUGH , nNo, little girl, tough for you! We will be going elsewhere in the future.",1
Their pour over coffee is sooooo smooth. Delicious! It would be great if they didn't have just one size. I wanted ALOT of coffee and was unfortunately limited with their size selection. Another thing I would improve is either using insulated cups or cup rings to avoid getting burned! They gave me another cup to put my coffee cup in and it was still pretty hot! Not very cost efficient overall.,2
Classy mexican restaurant few miles from the the biltmore area. Servers are very attentitive. Menu has some unique items and the few dishes I have tried have all been great. Defnitley reccomend. Enchiladas were great and a slow cooked pork dish that I forgot name of . Two people with drinks expect a ill 60 80.,2
These guys are a scam. They towed my car from down town. Charged 300 to get it out even though it had been in tier possession for only 1 hour. While getting it back there were two others here that got towed from the same exact parking space. They have only one sign. It's almost on the roof that says no towing. Nothing else. It's an empty parking lot. See the pix,1
"We came on a livingsocial. The place looks great. Looks hi quality. Looks like the food would be good. However, that's where it stops. We had 4 types of sushi. All were very average. All very small. The rainbow roll was again average, as well as the rest. Basically a nice place with avg service and nice looks, avg food at a very very overpriced bill ! Will not be back.",1
"This is the park to go if you LOVE outdoor activities. You can do it all here, from soccer to tennis. All that's missing is a basketball hoop and you have yourself a fully equipped outdoors gym. And during Sundays there is a sea of people on Mount Royal that are taking some vitamin D. Jeanne Mance park is the ideal kick it spot for everyone.",2
"Really? Only 3.5 stars? My boyfriend and I went here during our first trip to Vegas together about 4 years ago. Maybe it changed since then, but I remember everything we had was excellent.from appetizers to dessert. Shrimp cocktail were huge and delicious! Steaks were off the hook. Chocolate cake was devine! Service was excellent. Need to go back here next time we are in the area.",2
"Yum! nEyes were much bigger than the stomach! Had to order 3 different specialty dogs to try them! Definitely didn't finish. The euro fries were awesome also. So rich though. The mayo sauces on top of cheesy meaty goodness is almost too much to handle. Definitely will be returning, just not until next month!",2
not a fan. they held the vip guestlist line until 11pm and when we got inside there was NO ONE in the club. there was open bar and drinks were strong. kind of shady crowd.we think one of the girls we were with was roofied. we won't be coming back. the only good thing about this place was the ladies' room. it was very nice.,1
"Hostess sent us upstairs since we wanted appetizers and drinks. We headed up and were met by a very rude bartender upstairs. He was not interested in finding us a place to seat. We asked about a table near the bar and were told to go downstairs and ask the hostress. Downstairs, we were told it was for dinner and if we were only eating appetizers we couldn't sit there.",1
"I love sandwiches. Lee's makes good sandwiches. From Bahn Mi to Turkey.Need I say more? Ok, I will. They also have great almond croissants they usually only make TWO per day, so better get one and other baked goods.Great Iced Coffee and Boba, free WiFi and more. Service is good and those manjoo creme filled cakes aren't bad either.lol",2
"Searched for a cleaners that offered next day dry cleaning. Although none specifically indicated they offered this, took a chance and went here due to great reviews. after a few times here, realized they don't actually dry clean everything. Some of my things shrank. After overhearing another customer complain, decided to nGo elsewhere.",1
Went here with some friends cuz of love for seafood. I was surprise it was small for such a popular place. Food was awesome. I had had 2 lbs of crawfish and 2lbs of snow crabs. I was a bit disappointed because they ran out of Dungeness my original order. on a Tuesday! But overall good experience. The staff was wonderful. The food was great. Definitely recommend you drop by when in Vegas,2
"I just got back from Italy couple of months ago haven't been able to eat any pizza here since.finally remembered i went to Grimaldis in old town years back liked it.tried the one in Scottsdale Quarter by my house it was even better. Just got the Thin Crust, with Roasted Red pepper Ricotta cheese.yum yum yum.also nice atmosphere there!",2
"Sadly, Shun Lee is really going downhill. It used to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in Charlotte. I have been going there for over 30 years and have noticed the general decline. I ate there a few weeks ago and it wasn't good. I hoped it was just a fluke but then tonight we had Generals Tso's chicken and it was horrible no flavor at all. I won't be back.",1
"Do not think all Port of Subs are alike. This location is AWFUL. We've had bad service more than once. We won't go back after the second time. The bad service was unbelievable. They actually argued with my co worker over what she wanted on her sandwich and got really testy. Just absolute jerks, I can't say it enough.",1
"Horrible customer service. I tried to place an order, giving them a chance after their last fuck up, but I find out they don't even deliver between 1400 1600. When I called to place an order the man on the phone was very rude and condescending while informing me of this, will never order from this place again! STAY AWAY!",1
"The place for innovative and exceptional cocktails! The food is solid. Enjoyed the Shrimp, Sliders, and Steaks. The bar menu is wonderfully insane however! Great beer on tap, wine list with the classics plus several out of the ordinary gems. The true star though is the cocktail menu! You won't be disappointed here!",2
"It's famous for a reason! I agree with everyone else. DEFINITEly get the smoked meat sandwich and at least get the medium cut. For me, it was the perfect amount of fat to go along with the meat. Enough that you get bites of the melt in your mouth taste and texture but not so much that it overpowers everything else.",2
Way better than Plato's Closet. Much bigger supply and more spacious than Plato's layout. Staff is great. Plato's wasn't even giving cash for clothes at the time so I called Buffalo Exchange and an employee cheerfully told me their store ALWAYS exchanges cash for clothes. Definitely the place to go if you're trying to sell.,2
"This place is AMAZING ! First walked in was greeted by a very lovely receptionist, offered me anything I wanted to drink. I passed on the beer had a water And its complementary. My barber Tim Avalos hooked me up gave me an awesome cut! Its very professional and soothing. I would recommend this Grooming Lounge to anyone. I'll most definitely be coming back Ty",2
"1st time here. Had the bacon blue cheese burger. Ordered it medium and it came very pink inside, almost to the point of being raw. Other than that, it was good with a generous portion of French fries. nHad the brownie sundae for dessert outstanding. nService was attentive and friendly no issues. nWill eat here again.",2
"Place smells very very musky mildewy. I should have left when I smelled the place. I ordered their ""house chicken "" it was basically overcooked fried chicken in a very watered down teriyaki sauce I ate two bites and asked for the check. Husband ordered beef with broccoli it was cold. Don't waste your time. Go to Great Wok instead for great take out.",1
"Love this place! We have floated from place to place looking for just the right care, love and learning for our children. We found that at Goddard. We were hesitant enrolling them because of tuition costs, but they are worth every single penny. Love the staff, the location and the fun that they provide for my children while I work. Thanks Goddard!",2
Favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas. It's a 30 min drive one way and still we go. Quality and selection is excellent. Many AYCE places will not customize orders. these guys do. The staff is great. food is awesome. atmosphere clean and club trendy.but everyone knows this. so I recommending calling ahead. don't be suprised to wait a while for a table during peak hours.,2
"Bad service.waitress made mistake about our order and another waitress blamed on us.WHAT?! However, the younger waitress is nice.Meat and seafood is not fresh. the food is more at sour side.we r the only customer in the lunch time.wrong wrong decision to eat here.the thai style noodle house is much more better which is within 2 minutes walk way .",1
"Wow! What a great find in Montreal! This restaurant doesn't show up much on reviews just yet. We found it recommended by Lesley Chesterman from Montreal Gazette. Absolutely fabulous food and wine selection! Wait staff were excellent, knowledgable and very accommodating of my imperfect French. A pricey evening but well worth every cent. Will definitely go again when we are back in Montreal.",2
"For being in the Bellagio, the dishes were very sub par. I live in the Bay Area, so I do speak with bias I can easily find the same quality dish for half the price, within walking distance from my apartment in Berkeley. Some of the dishes were bland. Overall, the food was mediocre. nThe price is reasonable for Vegas.",1
"decent place. tvs, outside seating, and a roll of paper towels hanging on every table! i'm definitely a fan of pizza and beer, only you have to drink the beer there draft pretty good! , so take out doesn't afford that combination. they have wine too. their appetizers seem good, but i just had the pizza with veggie toppings which was just ok. nothing too special here. maybe its location.",1
I stop in here from time to time with a friend who lives locally. We really enjoy their chicken cobb salad and have never ordered anything else! I have to say that the people who work here are all VERY friendly. Everyone greets you and the atmosphere is really relaxed and enjoyable. I know this is a 'chain' but this one feels like a local hangout with friendly people!,2
Blecccch. There's a reason they give the food away here half price half the time and have a million coupons and deals on line. The food sucks. Service was unprofessional and harried despite the place being nearly empty. The room has all the ambience of a bus station. Crummy live band was playing way too loud. Stay away. Stay far away.,1
"Live right next to this place and needed to grab some beer after getting home from the airport. Usually liquor stores have a somewhat decent beer selection, but this place didn't. No Blue Moons, no Corona Lights, nothing but the standard Bud, MGD, Coors, and Natty Light. Skip this place if you're doing a beer run.",1
Even though I had to wait 30 minutes in line I cannot complain because kris and the other guy working the register were extremely patient and nice with everyone who didn't have their shit together. They went the extra mile and gave great customer service. Half hour wait was only bad thing but fill out your info online people!,2
Staff is lazy and I took 2 vehicles here and they both came out with bugs still all over and they didn't wash grill area or rims. I was getting what was supposed to be a 120 service. This place is grubby and staff looks like they want nothing to do with washng vehicles or doing a good job. I will NEVER go here again!,1
I came here with my husband since he had to get a new Rolex watch. Their selection was pretty good and the prices were reasonable. What stood out for me was the service. We got a chance to meet and chat with Darryl one of the owners who was very personable and genuinely friendly. I would definitely come back here again for future purchases.,2
"do not go here! nno stars is too many! nThis is my nieces haircut. I would have gone back in there immediately. nAre these "" stylists "" blind! nI cannot believe they let her walk out of this place with a haircut like this. nIt looks like they cut her hair with a butter knife. nPay a real stylist and skip this place. UNBELIEVABLE!",1
"Pretty good experience at ramen tatsu. If you don't want to wait Monta, this could be an option. It's not quite up to par with Monta's chashu but everything else is pretty close. I'm also pretty sure they use the same distributor for their noodles as Monta. Overall I give this place 4 stars, which in my book is still pretty good!",2
"Here we go another year later and another change in ownership, but the way they try to explain why it takes 45 minutes to serve your order is amazing. Things happen, but take responsibility especially if you knew at the time of my order you are running behind. Food is still above grade, but the service sucks.",1
"Horrible Service. Ricky the ""manager "" is rude and unhelpful. It took 18 minutes to get our food, and when we complained our check was refunded but then Ricky took the food out of my hands and told me "" you can't have no free food "" horrible and shameful. Dave would roll over in his grave if he knew what was going on.",1
"I have been here 3 times in 4 weeks. I love it. It's more than just great food, the employees are great, the atmosphere is great. I have gone alone sat at bar had a beer and some lunch, I have taken friends there for dinner, and brought my kids here for a treat. Each time was great experiance. Everything I have tried has been well prepared, plenty of food and again great friendly service .",2
"The massage was okay. nI just hate being pressured into memberships. nIt's hard to resist after getting a massage because you're so light headed. nYou can't really think straight. All I really wanna do is go in, get massage relax, and pay and get the F out. nI don't need you stressing me out, trying to push a membership on me. Over all my experience was alright. nI'm sure there's better.",1
Wow! This might be the best Neopolitan pizza I have outside of Italy. We tried 4 different pizzas and all were outstanding. All ingredients were authentic and extremely fresh. Crust was absolutely perfect. The decor and service was also excellent. I will definitely return the next time I am in Phoenix.,2
"From what I can recall, the burger was juicy with just the right amount of pink in the middle. The Guiness Shake, one of the best shakes I have EVER had! The sweet potato fries, not your soggy type but a crisp flaky feeling of goodness coupled with an amazing lunch experience in Vegas. Will I go back? Most definitely. It's time to try some of their other meals on menu.",2
"This buffet was pathetic. Flamingo should be ashamed. We payed and walked out without even eating. Fortunately we had the unlimited buffet pass. The food was all cheap stuff and looked like it has been sitting there for days, forget hours. Very disappointed. I guess that's why it was one of the only buffets with no line.",1
"I've had their pizza to go, at the bar, and dining in seated next to the windows . In all cases GREAT PIZZA and excellent service. I have to give an extra thumbs up to Tim who's service was warm and very attentive it made the dining experience even better love when that happens . I'll be back it's in a great location to stroll afterwards as well or go to the movie.",2
"Ordered a small calzone to share. It was plenty big enough to share but they are 16 for plain cheese and 2 for each additional topping. That is just crazy to me. The pepperoni is like the kind in the chef boyardee pizza kits, just not what I was expecting. Overall, it was okay. The service was good, the wait was really long, the food was meh. Maybe try the pizza next time.",2
Another good meal . this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience.,2
"The undisputed leader of fast hamburger joints they are giants of chopped meat cuisine and haute fashion they have an impressive array of t shirts and other garments accessories for sale . Why don't they come to New York City? I'll have a double double with cheese. Wait, make that 7 double doubles with cheese. And one of your new design t shirts of course you know that I wear an X Large .",2
"I am so confused by the first two reviews. My experiences here have always been first rate. The staff are friendly and accomodating. The dentists are warm, gentle and knowledgable. I have NEVER been in pain while there, and the end result has always been excellent. I believe I receive high quality dental care.",2
"By far some of the shitest start in history! There's a fat Greek guy that works the graveyard shift. .what a douchebag, insults customers, gives so much lip. Pity because place is decent looking and food is relatively pk for a belle pro. This Is how good places go under, by crappy staff thinking they are doing the customer a favor. Ridiculous",1
"Worst mechanical experience! Not even worthy of 1 star! Way over priced their oil was more than what my car manufacturer charges , not very personable, terrible customer service, AND THEY DAMAGED MY BUMPER IN 2 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS DURING ALIGNMENT! I'm calling corporate about this and will NEVER come here again!",1
"Having never tried this restaurant before and the one we usually go to closed, we decided to give it a try. We ordered the Greek Chicken Salad and let me tell you, it was pretty gross! The texture of the chicken was pasty and it reminded me of the gross, canned deviled ham meat. Once we put the dressing on it, it got gummy. Never again!",1
"I haven't bothered visiting this location for about a year because of crap service and food. Gave it a shot the other night and they have really stepped their game up! The server was very nice and well trained, the chicken sandwich was very tasty! Kudos for turning things around and hopefully they will keep it up!",2
"It's inside the MGM, so it's gotta be good, right? Nope. Wolfgang, you let me down big time. Flavors reminded me more of Arby's rather than a high quality cafe. My ruben tasted like a sloppy joe, and my salad was pathetic. Greens with oil on them? Come on? How about some texture? tomato? carrot? cucumber? nuts? anything? You're so cheap Wolfgang.Service is fine though.",1
The service and ambience were excellent however the food was awful. We ordered a 27 Fettuccine alla Bolognese described as homemade fettuccine with meat sauce. The meal was disgusting. My husband and I only ate a few bites before deciding to leave. The fettuccine was not homemade and the meat sauce was awful. I would rather pay 27 for a frozen TV dinner than eat there again.,1
"3 girls on Saturday night early, maybe before 7 definitely still daylight . We came for a cocktail to enjoy the fountains from a lounge experience. Place had not turned 'clubby', was just a high end lounge. Place is classy, view is great, servers are attentive beautiful , drinks are really not that pricey considering your location. Can't wait to go back, maybe even for late night experience.",2
"This has to be the best breakfast I've ever had! I ordered the special which was scrambled eggs with sweet peppers, whiskey fennel sausage and Havarti cheese. It was outstanding! We had to wait for over an hour which we knew that going in. The food was definitely worth the wait. Looking forward to going back again!",2
I was SHOCKED! My mother was in the dry cleaners business and im 50 years old and never thought to ask prices because I never would have believed one shirt was over 6.50! My shorts were 6.50! Oh My Gosh! Robbery! Come on! Get real! How will they stay in business? I have never had a bill this expensive! Never! Don't use this dry cleaners!,1
Went here for breakfast twice during a 2 day stay in Montreal. The food was absolutely fantastic and the ingredients were very fresh. Everything was arranged on the plate with many different components each adding their own flavor and contribution to the overall meal. I would definitely go to this place again if I happen to find myself in this great city.,2
"Apparent owner is always at register and is aware of everything in his kitchen, which is great! Awesome gyros and the greek salad is handmade, meaning it's not pre packaged which is my biggest gripe with some places. The can actually put extra onions and hold the tomatoes! Wow, what a concept. A little pricey for lunch, but then again it's NScottsdale.pita bread is soft and fresh.",2
"I think a lot of people need to realize that this location is in Vegas and basically everything is overpriced! My BF and I shared the planet hollywood hotdog and it was delicious! Strips of bacon, mushrooms, nacho cheese and onions on a polish dog yummmayy! Open 24 hours with a good amount of seating outside!",2
"i go here often. this is one of the largest of all chinese buffets as far as selection. the prices are reasonable, on the cheaper end. i always have good food here. it's not a fancy place and some of the booths have tears. they do have a couple tvs so if you want to catch and news or a game you can watch it while eating. i think this is an A for large variety. the servers are always quick.",2
"One of the best in Vegas, second only to Sen for sushi imo. Atmosphere was good, service was mediocre if not a little slow, but the sushi was killer. Great rolls, perfect nigiri, yummy cocktails. And absolutely the best value for sushi I've had anywhere. So stinking cheap considering how great everything was.",2
"This is one of my favorite high end restaurants to go to in Vegas. It is located at the Mandalay Bay's Hotel side on the top floor. It has a spectacular view of the strip and not to mention, the atmoshphere and food is amazing. It's a great place to bring guests from out of town. Immediately after dinner, there is a lounge right next door where you can boogy woogy the night away.",2
"I had the Bronzed Catfish and Grits with pork sausage. It was a wonderful, taste popping meal. The grits are a restaurant specialty that includes smoked gouda cheese as one of their ingredients. This place is directly south of the premium outlets. We stayed parked and walked to Rick's Restorations, which is across the rail tracks from their parking lot. This restaurant was featured on DDD.",2
"2 things 1 Ive had better sandwiches at Subway. Their bread is stale, meat is dry, and if you get a sandwich ""Mike's way "" they smother it in oil and vinegar. 2 There were ants all over the drink counter and IN THE NOZZLES. My husband pushed the button for Sprite and got Sprite w a power boost of live ants in his glass. Dirty place, bad food.",1
Best salon! Always clean and you can tell the stylists knew what they're doing. I've been going to Raquel for a few years now and even though I've moved to the other side of town I'll always make the trek to see her. She really cares about what you're looking for and will make suggestions if you don't know. Definitely check this salon out.,2
"I love this place! Anytime I'm in Scottsdale, I have to stop here! You never know what beautiful items they have, since it's ever changing! Next time I'm in the market for furniture this will be my first stop! Great prices, of course the longer they have something, the lower the price and great staff!",2
"They are so amazingly rude and impossible to work with ""We are out of the ribs on the kalbi combo "", ""Fine. just put something else on e.g. kaluha pork, or chicken "", ""No we can't substitute anything "" well then I can find a different place to eat this is the second time I boycott them last time it lasted 2 years, this time it is FOR EVER!",1
I love Pro Nails. Best nail salon in C U area. Very reasonably priced also. My friend and I are regulars there for pedicures and they know our names and even got us cute little Christmas Presents this year. Love it here! Highly highly recommended. Oh and the hot stone massage during pedis is FABULOUS.,2
Got a 5.00 small burrito bowl. 1.50 extra for 'grilled' vegetables that were practically fresh and FAR from grilled that I threw out since I specifically asked for NO green peppers and none of it was cooked. An extra 1.50 for shrimp.got 6 of them in total. A little less than thrilled overall. Wish I'd just braved the line at Johnny Burrito.there is a reason there is a line there aot here.,1
The music sucks and it's built so that the dance floor is just one big mob of people when it gets packed. It gets way too crowded in that place and you can't move around. If you are stuck in the middle of the dance floor you can't leave. It's wayyy too crazy there. Just like one fancy rave. I wouldn't go there again.,1
AMAZING! We went for breakfast to the IP location. We were sat immediately it was 8am . I ordered the Hash House Quesadilla and my husband ordered the Chorizo Hash. Mine was falling over the sides of the plate large and his was served in a cast iron skillet filled to each side. The meal was perfect! Service was great. Prices are reasonable. Portions are HUGE! Will definitely return.,2
"Outstanding! Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time. Met the owner and cook.both very nice conscientious people. This is the best Chinese I've had in Arizona, remarkable at the best prices as well. The only thing preventing a 5 star is that their facility is pretty small without much ambiance.but the food.amazingly delicious.",2
I am giving this place 2 stars because 1. The Waiter was a douche bag and argued with a guest at my table. 2. Waiter got multiple orders wrong this was before the arguement 3. Drinks are way over priced and not even that good. 4. The food wasn't that great. 5. You are basically paying for the name and that it is Eva Longoria's restaurant. The only thing I really liked was the decor.,1
"A pretty good dining experience overall. The server was very friendly and accommodating. The food was yummy and the cocktails were great. The menu choices were a bit limited. I also wanted a side of steamed veggies for my preschooler, and the only choices were asparagus and green beans. No carrots, peas, or broccoli in a restaurant?",2
"Super cleaners, strange that you would assign yourself such an heroic moniker . The Lex Luther of menstrual stains attacked my sheets this morning and a true super hero would have been there to fight back! I can only assume from your lack of commitment to your craft that your ideals are as weak as your business practices . Woof!",1
"Don't listen to any naysayers, this is a good, local restaurant. I like it because every time I eat there, I can get something different and it always hits the spot. The Philly sandwich is tasty, as well as the prickly pear chicken one. Finally tried the pizza and wings and those are great too. Service has always been great and have never had a problem here.",2
"Tony and I have been touring pizza establishments for some time now in search of the ""best pizza "". We even have a rubric for our pizza. Raffaele's is a definite 10 and by far the very best pizza we have tried to date. We are heading back there again tonight for more! Can't get enough of the sicilian, freshly made NY style pizza with lots of cheese.and I'm from New York! Keep it up Raffaele's!",2
"This place is awful to order Togo from! My food was 15 minutes late, they forgot my fries, and the sauces. The manager didn't even offer to discount the food and the poor Togo boy was running his butt off trying to make things right for two other Togo customers! Never again will I order Togo from this awful place!",1
"This is my favorite DB in the metro Phoenix area. I don't know why, but for some reason this is the only Dutch Bros that makes Double Chocolate Mochas that aren't too bitter. My favorite location for my favorite coffee chain. Recommended Iced Salted Caramel Double Chocolate Mocha quite a mouthful! Also a warning it's extremely rich, definitely more of a dessert than a casual drink ",2
"I get to this FN place at 701am practically the first one that walks in. I request an oil change and the store manager says ""do you have a couple of hours? "" A couple hours? 3 hours for an oil change? Wth? Been here a couple times and that's the last time I return. Worthless location staff your location correctly.",1
"the museum is for the most part pretty lovely. but if you go, you seriously need to check out the second building a block or away. like, 3 floors of more awesome installation art. and the gift shop has weirdest yet coolest things. there's also a cafe. i've never actually gotten anything from there though.",2
"Service not friendly. Instead of greeting us when we came in, they told us they were closing in an hour. Fish was not fresh. Spicy tuna roll had an off fishy taste. Asked for no sauce on roll, but roll came with sauce. Overall was disappointed, would not recommend and will not go back. We only went there because our favorite sushi spot,soho, was not open.",1
"Delicious! Each person in my group of 4 left happy and satisfied with our meal choice. Not the most authenic Mexican food, but very fresh and unique. Strong and tasty margaritas! Warm welcoming serivice and decor. Comfortable and spacious seating in the dinning area and bar. Very pleased with my experiance!",2
"The staff was really unimpressive. The food, okay. Overpriced for what you get. They are really trying to run an upscale restaurant but they have a long way to go to achieve this. Wine list is very limited, the food portions are tiny and the staff is a tad bit stuffy. You can find far better in Charlotte than what they offer here.",1
"Not really sure why all the great reviews. I got the Fried strips. They were just ok. Without any sauce they are really flavorless. Much prefer Raising Canes. Had the famous Mac N Cheese.again just ok, no flavor. The BFG sauce was pretty decent. Would possibly go back if in the neighborhood and need some grub, but wouldn't go out of my way for it.",1
"Ummmm red velvet ice cream? YES! Great ice cream on a chilly phoenix afternoon. A little pricey, 5 schmoes for a kids cup. Total for 2 adults and a toddler about 18.00 bucks. The chicks working the counter were super cool tho and I thought the overall vibe was nicer than ColdSlabCreamatorium. Thumbs up cats and birds.",2
I've seen Biloxi Blues not for kids and Alice in Wonderland performed by adorable kids of all ages . All of the actors are fantastic! Both stages I've been in were very intimate which I like. The staff is amazing and very helpful. I bring a light jacket or sweater as I tend to get chilly but its so worth it! Can't wait to check out some more shows!,2
"Located on the Northeast corner of Flamingo and Rainbow, adjacent to the Sprout's Farmers Market. Best place to buy fresh baguettes. At a little over 2 each, can't beat it anywhere else. And limited amount daily ! So go early ! Haven't tried anything else but seems pretty busy every time i come here with customers eating.",2
"A fine way to spend a few hours when you're sick of walking the strip and tired of smoky casinos. The pricing system made no sense to me you purchase 10 of credit on a swipe card with a 2 processing fee, kinda crappy but it was a fun time. Options for ticket redemption were totally lame. Why have them at all?",1
"Quick stop at the mall, and figured this was the healthiest choice for lunch. Love my chicken walnut sandwich on molasses bread and my free chocolate chip cookie Usually I get a pick two combo half sandwich with a soup or salad but was feeling like a whole sandwich today. Mall location is okay, the restaurant locations are much better. Nice staff and quick service, not a bad place .",2
"Les meilleurs cupcakes jusqu' u00e0 date go u00fbt u00e9s u00e0 Montr u00e9al. Le gla u00e7age est succulent, il n'est pas trop sucr u00e9 ni trop gras, a un petit go u00fbt de beurre et n'est pas granuleux. Le g u00e2teau est aussi tr u00e8s bon. La boutique est jolie et l'employ u00e9 qui nous a servi u00e9tait tr u00e8s cordial. J'y retournerai c'est certain.",2
This place is going downhill fast. Always out of something you want to order. The food is great after you actually get it. It's such a shame I used to love this place. Took almost an hour to get yogurt and salad and ALL the waitstaff and managers look miserable. I guess it would be tough telling people you are out of something 50 times a day ,1
"I must go into detail and raise my rating of this hotel. It is absolutely perfect. The staff is perfect and I have had about 10 stays here and it just gets better and better. The Wynn, The Hotel, and the Four Seasons need to come and take note of what true 5 star quality is. You will not be disappointed.",2
"keep this place clean! whwn I was sitting by the cash register I could see how dirty it was. Brown paper towels,papers,trash can full and walking buy like there was nothing on the floor.it was a slow night. Nobody was there but my couisn and me. Please keep your work area clean cause it makes jack in the box dirty and ghetto.",1
I really liked sushi 21 because they offer 2 hour limit for dinning AYCE. they also offer one type of sashimi. and they have a lot variety to choose from. also desert was part of all you can eat too! they offer mochi ice cream. the staff were really nice and they really how to take care their regular customer!,2
"One of the best Thai Places I know, Never fails to impress guest from out of town, out of the country. Food is as close to Authentic thai food. Curry are a bit spicy. If you palate does not want Very Spicy food then request the spiciness to be 0, otherwise 4 or 5 spiciness is already VERY spicy for the typical palate.",2
"Not sure what the big deal was with the bad review here, but after reading it, I would never want to have dealings with that lady.Anyway, David Woollen showed up this AM to get rid of hornets.He was calm, professional while my wife was freaken. He reassured her the type of hornet we had was harmless, she asked him to get rid of them anyway, and he did his duty! Will call again!",2
I love this place especially because they offer options for people who don't want a burger. Hamburger meat doesn't sit well in my stomach so I get their veggie sandwich with cheese. AMAZING! nThe fries are crispy and hot every time. They could move a little faster making everything but no complaints as far as quality.,2
I have used AMS Landscaping for probably close to 3 years now. They are very dependable and reliable. I find their rates to be very competitive and always do a good job. I have consulted with Eli oumerous projects and he is a wealth of information. I would highly recommend AMS to anyone searching for the services they provide.,2
The food at Panera is always good and fresh and doesn't take more than 5 minutes for it come out. The only problem with this place is their staff. They seriously are all so rude and walk around like they hate their lives and make me uncomfortable when I go in because of how rude and bothered they are.,1
"Genesis is the absolute best. I've gone to her for more than a year now, every 3 4 weeks, and the cut is consistent and awesome. Her attention to detail separates her from any other stylist I've ever gone to. If you're a guy and you care about your hair, you can't do better than Genesis for a cut. Not cheap at 35 tip, but it's worth every penny.",2
If I could give this place a negative star I would! I had to ask my nail tech multiple times to go over areas on my feet which she missed by pure laziness. I get my toes done once every 2 weeks so they aren't even bad in the first place. Next it took her a total of 20 min from start to finish to complete my pedicure. This was such a waist if money and time I will never again return.,1
"Absolutely amazing food! I am always the one to try something different and this was a great pick. Servers were wonderful, fast and attentive. Food was amazing! We ordered Olive sampler, Borsht, Hungarian Goulash, Stuffed Peppers and the Thracian Clay Pot. EVERYTHING was superbly prepared. I will definitely be going back.",2
Waiter was rude. Food was just ok. Nothing special at all. Restaurant ambiance very nice but it doesn't live up to expectations. We ordered black pepper shrimp which arrived cold. Ordered coke zero which arrived flat. One other dish green curry arrived with a spoon that's normally used by people to eat soup! Have never seen a dish served with that kind of small spoon.,1
"My grandpa wanted to look good for his upcoming trip so I brought his here. He got in a chair right a away and was given the five star treatment. The guys were friendly and we even met the owner. I felt bad because the old man under tipped so I decided to do my part and leave a good review! This is a nice little pop shop that costs as much and great clips. Go here, you will not be disappointed.",2
"Food good, service is good. Be prepared to WAIT. Try the pancake flight and Bennie combo with another cake subbed for the browns at least 4 us, I like crisper browns on the first visit so u get to know the menu. Brewmosa was good beer and oj . Good shade outside, sat comfortably outside on a warm September mid morn.",2
"me and my girls are here all the time. The food specials are great and the service is good too. The wings of course are the main attraction here and they are as delicious as they seem. Tip if you like your wings drenched in sauce, you have to let them know that! the atmosphere is very casual, and nice to have dinner with friends to watch the big game or the big fight.",2
"This is by far my favourite Target in the Valley. If I can, I still go out of my way to go to this location. The Team Members are above and beyond, the location is still quiet and away from the madness of Vegas, the store itself is modern, welcoming, and always clean. I spent 6 hours in here the first time I went. Not even ashamed.",2
"Extremely expensive. Not worth the price. We paid over 100 for two people which included 35 for two margaritas, that were not very good. Chips and salsa are not offered for free. We ordered separately and regretted it. The salsa tasted like it came from a jar. The dinner was good but I could get the same thing for 1 3 the price elsewhere.",1
"I eat here at least 2 or 3 times a week. When your husband life partner has to be on a low carb diet, it's cheaper than trying to stock up on groceries. I love the selection and freshness. nI've eaten at numerous ones when I lived in Los Angeles and have tried more than a few since I moved to Vegas but this one is one of my all time favorites. nI think I'll go there now!",2
"always great never disappointed me. Day show and night show are totally different because of the lighting and everything. You don't even have to wait for the perfect show time. If you walk around this trip, you will see the show at least one time. Or you can check online to see the show time so you can enjoy the entire piece of music and this masterpiece!",2
"So I went for a ""quick "" lunch today and ordered a simple fried rice and waited 20 minutes,when I caught the woman at the counter realize that my order wasn't placed so she sent the order and preceded to argue with another customer about a take out that was done wrong. Waited a couple of more minutes then left and ate at Johnny's Red Bowl . The End !",1
"I love Bohemian type of fashion. They're my type nUrban Outfitters is amazing when it comes to delivering all the fashions I ask for. What I bought nAll Seeing Eye Necklace 30 n Description Very ancient looking, green gem. Jeffrey Campbell Americana T Strap Heel 150 n Description Like American flag but shoe version. PJ By Peter Jensen Knit Jacket 70 n Description Blue, cozy",2
"I am a transplant from Tucson who now lives in Scottsdale. Since my move over 10 years ago, I have been trying to find a goto cheap Mexican food restaurant that I could depend on. La Fonda is it. For me, it's all about the enchilada sauce and La Fonda's is very good. The food is reasonably priced and easy for take out.",2
Every time I've required a repair from this place it ends up coming back. And the manager I think his name is Brad has the balls to tell me that it must be my fault. If they repaired things right the first time I wouldn't be so pissed off. I would avoid this place with a passion. Their own saving grace is head mech. Donny who is knowledgable and friendly.,1
We booked the hotel one day before for 59 per night taxes etc. one day earlier it was 89 per night . The upgraded room was a tower luxury suite. I liked the safe that was in the room. The beds were very soft. Unfortunately the Wifi was not accessible from the hotel room. The pool area is okay but you have to be there early to get a good place. Over all it was a very good experience,2
I have attempted to try this place 4 times and I'm thru trying. Way too small and always an hour wait. They need to get their asses in gear and fix this. I am not the only one leaving. I'm sure they could double if not triple their profit if they simply expanded or just fit a few more tables in. Screw y'all. I'll go somewhere that wants and is prepared for my business.,1
"I rather eat wall paper paste.I don't understand how you can mess up teriyaki chicken with broccoli and fried rice! No flavor bland. Chicken was dry. I had a heaping size of broccoli stalks.and maybe two florets.wtf? I wouldn't waste my time or money here, there are other places in the epi center to fancy.",1
"Best deal for shoe repair! I've been trying to get my boots resoled but didn't have it in me to pay 50 bucks that they charge everywhere else. I stumbled in here and they happily fixed up in a day for a mere 12. I mean this was after their painfully awkward attempt at small talk . ""so you have family in Japan? "" and ""you go to the gym a lot? "". but I'll bear that much for a 12 fix up",2
"Go here to watch Man City games. Place has always had good service, at least the bar does. I've never actually been there to sit down for dinner. Decent number of good European beers on tap Stella, Newcastle, Bass, etc. . I don't know why some of those other reviews were so harsh. This place does brisk business, so it can't be that bad. I enjoy myself when I'm here and plan on going back again.",2
"For a chain I really like this place. The atmosphere is very casual, and the food is consistently delicious. This is a great place to go with a large group as they have so many little rooms. The portions are huge so order with care. Location is perfect great place to dine before hitting the old town Scottsdale scene later. Bar area is decent with a reasonable crowd around happy hour.",2
"Can't comment on the Minus5 experience, since I didn't do it, so this review is for the Lodge Bar connected to it. Great place to sit down in the afternoon and watch some football. It was not crowded and the waitresses were really nice. I had some pleasant, quiet alone time away from the kids. Thanks wifey!",2
"Service is absolutely terrible and food is average. Server has a really bad attitude from the very start and is very unresponsive. We asked for bowls and they took our chopsticks away. For the pho, noodles are overcooked but soup is good and not oily. The udon is really oily though. Overall, the bad service destroys the eating experience and puts people in a bad mood.",1
Did not give me the room I booked. Room was old and small. Carpet in room soiled. nConstruction outside window for 5 days. Manager uncaring and curt and did not offer any compensation for our discomfort. Water in lobby for quest was empty. Rooms not cleaned in timely manner. Never received morning paper. Would not recommend this hotel. I am a Fairmont Club member.,1
"YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM! nI'm not even from Vegas and I heard about Capriotti's since it's famous amoung the locals. Now I can see and taste why! I loved LOVED my mushroom cheesesteak with grilled onions and peppers! Soooo freakin' good! nI just wish they had one here in the Bay Area, specifically somewhere across the street from my job. nDamn I'm craving Capriotti's right now as I write this review!",2
I found heaven in the middle of Scottsdale . I've had cupcakes and cake bites and every bite is DELICIOUS! I will be blaming a co worker when I start gaining weight because we come every Friday to get our fix. I love the interior of the shop . and you just walk in and smell the amazing aromas. I'm drooling just thinking about it.,2
I don't want to talk about it! It'll make me hungry and want to drive to Las Vegas NOW! I'm MAD! why no BACHI Burger in LOS ANGELES! REALLY. Here you go.GET THE Oxtail fries.and ask the waiter about the burgers featured on the food network show. Then chose from there. You CAN'T GO WRONG! mmmmmmm yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,2
Worst experience my sienna van had a wrap around warranty I bought thru them and they said they would repair my van and got me a rental car then the next day they said they would not honor their word. After back and forth they fixed it and when I drove a block the problem was worsen. I called no call back.,1
"this club is hands down the best club i have been to in Vegas. During CES, we came here to party it up and buy bottles on a Friday night Jan 9 . The VIP host took nothing but good care of us. The music was awesome really good house music and hip hop at times and the crowd was good looking. Love the indoor outdoor portions of the club, great place to go and dance all night.",2
Alfred who bartends The Piano bar inside of The Orleans is a major jack a . Why they tolerate his attitude is beyond me. As worthless as they come and he is extremely rude with everyone there including the regulars. If you can get his attention away from gabbing with the cocktail waitresses you will find out for yourself.,1
"I agree with the other reviewer. These people call me, tell me they have worked on my vehicle even had the make and model which they obviously have gotten off some list as they have NEVER worked on my vehicle before and then went to tell me that they aren't selling anything and then proceeded to try to sell me something. Unbelievable. SCAM!",1
Loving the food and service here. Very clean lots to choose from and none of it boring. Really innovative food with a great taste. It's gluten free as well also nice for those who need that option cause there is nothing lacking in the food options. Great addition to the neighborhood we are loving this precious gem called Jewels.,2
Brought large group. Told 30 minute wait. Bought beer when waiting. Horrible service. They couldn't care less how long we waited. Finally split us up. Really what you want when you have family in town. Our fault we didn't leave. Unfortunate that the hostesses are clueless. Don't bother coming here if you want service.,1
"I went to this place once and the owner tried to sell me a large box, for shipping a guitar, for 30 dollars! My Wife has been in there before, and the Dude is really surly, terse laconic. He has hired some youngsters who seem friendly and helpful Had to pick up a fax from an insurance agent there recently But, I wouldn't go out of my way to do any business there!",1
"Had to stop in for their Signature Short Rib Eggs Benedict! I'm not a big fan if beef in the morning, but this just melted in your mouth. Service was good for the morning and I was pleasantly surprised how busy it was. Definitely will come back again. Really impressed with many of the Cosmopolitan bars and restaurants.",2
I wanted to like this place. Who else is open with happy hour with sushi at 2am when I'm having horrible cravings? But the service was bad. The waiter seemed to be pissed off or something and pretty much took it out on us muttering under his breath and all. It ruined our happy vibes and made us feel awkward. Just a very disappointing first time experience and sadly my last visit.,1
"Food was good, server was also good. Beer could be a lot colder though, I suggested to have it turned down a little colder for next time and was looked at like I asked for the moon. I like my beer at 36 or colder, this was 45. This was my second time here and I will try once more for cold beer and then I quit.",2
"Good news first, or bad news? Let's go good news. The Good n n ! GLUTEN FREE BUNS AND BREAD ! n AMAZING ribs with an excellent dry rub n Homemade bbq sauce n Family owned and super friendly n Right down the street from my house. n Wonderful sides The Bad n n Went today for bbq and IT'S CLOSED. DAMNIT!",2
"I have never had worse service in my life! From the lady at the front counter to waiting for 15 min at the snack bar, only to be greeted by someone who did not say a word to me and acted like I was bothering her. I told the manager he said he would give me some coupons. Never did. It's crazy I've been here before and it was always fine this time seriously the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!",1
"This Macy's is new nice. I wish I could say that for the staff. I was purchasing a coat at the register there was a messy pile of children's clothing laying on the counter. I picked one up to look at it was was told to ""STOP "". The store employee who looked at least 80 yelled at me told me not to touch it. I then walked away without purchasing a coat. TERRIBLE customer service!",1
"Everything's really tasty here, especially the cocktails. I would say everything's a little overpriced though. But it's north Scottsdale, so what do you expect. nAs mentioned in other reviews, the vampire taco is legit. I also liked the blackberry ginger margarita. Unless you like REALLY spicy food, you might avoid the viper taco.",2
"I agree with the other reviews that the lady is very nice. I placed the order waited, didn't take long at all. I ordered a egg roll, crab puffs and general tso chicken. The crab puffs were good, chicken was soggy and really had no flavor, the egg roll had fresh vegetables but really no taste also. There rice was really good but I will not return most likely.",1
"Rich did a great and thorough job with our home inspection. Back in June of this year, he did a home inspection of the interior and exterior of the home. . The inspection report he prepared was very informative and simple to navigate. Because of his inspection and report, we were able to resolve a few small issues before they became bigger issues.",2
"I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream on the side. The bean and cheese burrito was just as good as a Mission tortilla filled with Rosarita refried beans. The chips and salsa were okay. It boggles my mind that so many people love this restaurant when there are better options in the area such as La Condesa, Gallo Blanco, or Macayo's. You couldn't pay me to eat here again.",1
"Food's decent staff is generally friendly. The place is a little rough by US standards. Actually, it was a lot like places I went in the middle east in a number of ways. If you're squeamish about sparkling walls and counters, this probably isn't the place for you. If you're willing to overlook a bit to have some traditional middle east food, go for it you should like it.",1
"Located in the Cancun Resort, way way way off the strip. It was a 25 cab ride from the Las Vegas Hilton. I had a great massage, very soothing atmosphere, prices are reasonable. Other than the distance from the strip, the only other issue I have is it is buried within the resort and I had to ask directions twice once through the lobby to find it.",2
"What a waste of my money! I can pan fry a burger at home and it will still taste much better that this place. To think I spent almost 30 here, makes me angry.I want my money back. My daughter got the Oreo shake which was really good. But the burger was extremely disappointing. Don't even get me started at how gross the veggie fries were.YUCK!",1
"This place is hit or miss. Usually miss. 12 years ago I could find buttloads of out of print, hard to find gold. The past few years it just went down hill. Seems like ""New Times "" and ""Mtv "" run the show now. Just a bunch of main stream crap. Worth checking out on a boring day. Prices are to high, but once in a great while you find that hidden gem.",1
"Mediocre food and service. I used to work as a sushi chef so I can get kind of picky. You can taste how old the rice was, the rolls barely had filling, were bland, unseasoned, and messy. I went out of my way for this restraunt and I was disappointed. The only thing okay about this place is the price, but you seriously get what you pay for.",1
"Saw that Del Taco wasn't voted favorite or second favorite taco place by Las Vegas Review Journal readers. How can taco Bell be more popular than Del Taco? 69 cent basic tacos and 1.09 for three on Tuesdays is an incredible bargain. And better yet, they taste really good. And BTW, the crinkle cut fries are awesome too.",2
"This place is the best! All of the teachers are awesome. The studio is a perfect size and everyone is so nice and helpful. They have Pay What You Caon heated classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7 30pm and all proceeds go to a local charity, what can beat that? The heated classes are great also. I know that after my yoga practice, I will feel amazing, relaxed and energized at the same time!",2
"Bang for your buck! Love this place, as good if not better than other Vietnamese places in town, except so much more closer to campus than any of them. Their menu is simple but so far everything I've tried was good. And at a really really great price! big bowl of pho or vermicelli costs only 7. Their banh mis are also pretty good.",2
Came in to try Hawaiian for the first time. The guy working was io mood for customers that day. I asked two questions. On the 2nd question I was told to just look at the menu. I ordered 2 of the meals. One of which was missing sauce and both tasted mediocre. Will not be returning to any L L ever again. Avoid like the plague.,1
Went in after along day of work to get a good pizza. After watching the employees eat food with their fingers and not washing their hands after turned me off. But thats not it.they had their own drinks on the same counter where the pizza crust lays.who knows what is on the bottom of those cups. Dont even want to give them a star.so gross waste of 25 dollars cause we threw the pizza away.,1
My first visit to Harry's I tried the Hawaiian and grilled chicken flat breads and they both lacked flavor to say the least. They are a bit smaller than flat bread's I've tried in the past but that would've been okay had they not tasted so bland. On the upside they do make their own infused liquor and the beer list here is solid. Maybe I will give the food here another try in the future.,1
"Total drunk food, haha! They have cheap, huge portions available 24 hours, which is awesome, and I urge the drunkies to go. Unfortunately, if you haven't been knocking a few back, this is not a place I would recommend. Make that quite a few! From the meat, cheese, beans, rice, and sauces, everything was just so bland! It was actually shocking how flavorless tgd food was.",1
"RUN AWAY! Went for brunch mid morning on a Friday, seated in the corner of a back room sure to be ignored . After browsing their 10 page, grimey ass, PrintShop menu still covered with syrup from the 90's on it, and multiple servers runners bussers passing me by multiple times for 10 minutes without so much as a check in or glass of water, I peaced out.",1
"Delicious and quick, this is my new favorite place! Love going here for a quick eat at a great price! I really like to get a bunch of different things when I go places, and this place is great because everything is so delicious and around 7 10. My favorites Banh Cuon with the pork and mushroom, Pho Thai, Charbroiled beef sandwich, and a vanilla milk tea with boba! Enjoy!",2
"I realy enjoyed Teres' I love the decor and relaxing environment. I feel better as soon as I walk in the door. The prices are very reasonable. I love that they have a nail ""bar "" tab. you mark off what you want then take your tab to the front when your done. Sharon did an awesome job on my toes. I will definetly be back soon.",2
Ok so this may be partly my fault.I had never been to a Cici's Pizza before and had expected a lot more out of the experience. The only thing I thought was good was the cinnamon roll things. Everything else was not great.or not available. There was no salad or pasta available the entire time we were eating we were there for about 25 minutes . I guess you get what you pay for here. It's cheap.,1
"Great performance! If you are A. a fan of Sinatra or B. a fan of dancing.you'll certainly enjoy the show. nOlder crowd, but in one word I would describe this show as ""charming "" nThe dancers are incredibly talented and the music is beautiful. Frank Sinatra's voice accompanied by a live band on stage. nGo see it. ",2
"By far the best service I've ever had in Arizona. Our waiter, Sam, knew everything about not only the menu, but the intricacies of how it was prepared. The scallops and the chopped salad are amazing btw. I can't believe I haven't been here before. The perfect place for gastronomers in the area who are picky with what they want.",2
"Been here twice for happy hour. Fried calamari was good, but not out of the ordinary. Chicken and beef satays were good, but agaiot out of the ordinary. This place has an older crowd. Pros n Happy hour drink prices are cheap 3 for well drinks n Decor is nice with TVs Cons n Service fell short We always had to flag down the bartender to make us another drink and it wasn't busy ",1
"Before seeing Dr. McKeen, I asked how much an appointment would cost. That apparently is not approved questioning, because I got quite a bit of push back. I finally THOUGHT I had an answer but the bill was nearly twice as much as what was expected. It is not detailed, so not entirely clear what my insurance was billed for. Needless to say, I will not be going back.",1
"I've gotten a few things from here, from zalapeno balls, to quesadillas to burritos, to fish tacos. I have not been disappointed. I stand by their ""best of las vegas "" fish tacos wheormally, that is an item I would never order, but now I crave them. Service is top notch with lot of smiles from employees. Great job!",2
Worst Shawarma I've ever had. I thought it was nearly impossible to find bad Shawarma but this was old meat that tasted like it was aged after they shot the animal it was made from by leaving the carcass on the floor for a week. The spiced potatoes had flavor but were undercooked and the price wasn't that great either. I will avoid this place like the plague from now on.,1
I love this bakery so much! Highly recommend the almond croissant but they do run out so you'll have to stop by in the morning. The sandwiches are really good I love the prosciutto with butter and pickles. The baguettes are delicious. Street parking is annoying but welcome to the city drive around the block. It's worth it!,2
"This has become my Fav restaurant in Vegas! The Gin and Tonics are Amazing. The Egg with Caviar.too die! If Im at the Cosmo for other reasons like a show or concert.Ill Go to Jaleo and get the Jos u00e9's Gin and Tonic to go! nHendrick's gin, fever tree, lime, lemon, juniper, kaffir nBest drink EVER!",2
"I got the warm mozzarella appetizer and the mushroom pasta dish. Not very good. The mozzarella appetizer was good for the price but i would have to say that my pasta with mushroom and truffle oil was gagtastic. I seriously do not know why it tasted that way, but it got me nauseous and was extremely watery! Probably never coming here again. sorry!",1
"If meat is what you like, then this is the place. We had reservations and were promptly seated when we arrived. The side are buffet style and very good. They had servers walking around with large skewers of meat that stopped at your table whenever you had the green button face up. All of the meats were excellent. The service was great.",2
"My least favorite airport when flying East. However, if you book with Southwest or US Airways.you'l prolly end up here. I just hate how hard it is to get to the different terminals. On one occasion we really had to haul butt to get to out connecting flight. I guess the only way to avoid this place is book with another airline besides US Airways or Southwest.",1
"This was our last stop on party tours both times that my friends and I did it and this was not a good club. There was hardly anyone dancing and the music wasn't that great. The drinks were way over priced and the club closes pretty early. Unless it's a free event again, I won't go back to this club.",1
"Pet planet is a great company. They promote health and well being for animals and do not sell companies that supply cheap, crappy food. They have dry food, canned, raw food and ice cream for dogs. Treats too for cats and dogs. There is also some supplies for small animals. The workers are always well informed and they have small deals on certain days on the week. And have samplers of dry foods.",2
"Romantic, urban and cozy. Three things I love in any restaurant. It's a little pricey but a great place to go for a special occasion. Order the osso bucco, it's divine. Leave room for dessert, and if you are a fan of sangria, such as myself, I'd recommend ordering that too. Our server was incredibly polite as well as the gentleman who didn't let our water classes even get to half full .",2
"YUCK! Is ramen soup supposed to tast like greasy salt water? The restaurant itself was fine. We got seated right away, the beer, dumplings and service were all very good hence my 2 stars . But the soup was digusting! It did look pretty though. We wanted to try this place becasue we had seen it on TV and read about it in a Vegas food book. We were fooled.",1
"My first and only time here was two weekends ago. I had a good time with my girlfriends! We got hookups in Vegas, so we were pretty much at the front of the line, got in for free, and free table service. What I liked about this place was that it opened up to the pool area. It was gorgeous out there with the lights reflecting off the water.",2
This show is a great value. We paid 27 with Groupon and really enjoyed it. The musicians are outstanding and nailed it. It's a great tribute and fun time. You will have a great time and enjoy some classic rock and roll. Hats off to the whole cast and the costume designers. It's great when you see that everyone is having a blast and enjoying it.,2
We went to have a dinner buffet during the thanks giving weekend.They had Stale Biryani in the buffet.when we informed the staff about it.they just removed the stale biryani from the buffet.but got the same biryani after 10 mins from kitchen and placed in buffet.that's the quality of food they serve! Avoid Tamba,1
Ever walked into an old establishment and feel like you leave needing shower.welcome to Dona Maria. It's plain damp feeling and just unpleasant. The food was OK but being regular lunch eater in the downtown area I'm glad I waited so long to try this place and it will be a long time before I try it again. Sorry!,1
"If you're looking for an extremely knowledgeable and trustworthy financial advisor, Joe is the BEST! He has a unique ability to access the market and your risk tolerance to advise you on any financial issue. Joe truly cares about his clients and their interest. If you want GREAT advise and someone who will look out for you, call Joe!",2
"I live in town, had a couple of friends come into town, they were staying at Treasure Island. We thought this restaurant had a nice menu. But, we waited for atleast 5 minutes at our table without even having the server come over and take our drink order. Then we noticed 2 other tables that had been waiting longer than us. So we just got up went to eat somewhere else! I will never return.",1
"I've been eating here almost weekly for over 2 years. My friends and I call the place ""Roberto's "", after the owner. The food is great the wine list is very good the service is superb. There has been almost no turnover in staff.that tells you something. The best pasta is the Bigoli. And don't forget to try the chocolate dessert. Also a good place for a business lunch.",2
"Andrew and Patrick arrived on time, charged us a very reasonable flat rate and completed the job in exactly the amount of time they estimated. They even stopped at our storage with us to drop off pick up a few things! They brought their own equipment and 2 pick up trucks in case we needed more space. Best value and fantastic honest service!",2
"Trash. Dropped our subscription after 2 1 2 years. Now seeing them raffling tickets in K Mart to get people to take a subscription and seeing that Wal Mart sells it for a dollar a day, guess we were right. They have turned into a left wing rag which certainly doesn't support the majority of AZ readers.",1
"F N Awesome! Gf had a mushroom cheese burger.awesome! I had the ""Going Green "" chicken sandwich. Moist and delicious. Mesquite fries are the bomb! Cool atmosphere and nice people! A definite thumbs up! For all you complainers stick to your Burger King. Apparently your palate is more accustomed to mediocrity.",2
"Tried the 2 things most recommended by the girl who answered. Pizza and some Pastrami sandwich. The pizza was doughy and very bland and the sandwich was stuffed full of dy pastrami on what tasted like stale bread. This is last resort food at its finest. I hear the wings are good, maybe thats the only thing worth getting.",1
"I could literally eat here everyday. The only downside is that sushi isn't always available, but the quick service, perfectly cooked rice, mouthwatering sauces, and great selection in different cuisines makes up for it by far. And I prefer places that will wait for their sushi guy to come in at night to make a perfectly balanced and delicious roll!",2
"Stopped by for a late dinner , we sat outside on the patio it was a Friday night and the strip was jumping , music from the club next door was bumping and got us in the mode for a lil dancing . Wait staff was fast and friendly drinks were insanely good ! Had the rib eye and was cooked to perfection ! A must try !",2
"So delicious. Homestyle food is awesome and unique. I love the crepe hot cakes good with chocolate chips, strawberries, bananas or just plain with syrup. The morning after special is fantastic as well do that and substitute specialty hot cakes for the regular ones. You've got yourself a fantastic meal!",2
"Los Compadres rocks. It's nice to have a good mercado on this side of town. The carniceria meat market is well stocked and has a wide variety. Carnitas, carne asada, pork ribs.they're all here! I like the fresh sweet bread. And, I especially like the tamales. Sometimes you just have to have a tamale. Especially around the holidays. It's a Latin thing. Enjoy!",2
"Hey! Fun times! I was in Vegas because . Vegas! Stumbled literally on the BB and Chris Robinson was playing. One Hamilton later I'm upstairs in line for a beer and the band is sounding good. Magic Hat on tap? Yes please, plus a Stella. Sound is good, lighting is better. Think House of Blues but with a bowling alley. Overall a great venue with entertainment most nights.",2
"Best fast food nachos. I enjoy the pork or their ground beef. They have a lot of salsa choices, black beans and refried beans. their queso beats out other comparable places like Qdoba chipotle has chips but doesnt serve nachos, go figure . The staff is friendly and there usually it not a wait. Good value for the money.",2
"I will just say, there is NO COMPARISON to the original location on Main. I was so, disappointed in the atmosphere, the service and the food was terrible. The windows had no shades, the sun was glaring right where I was sitting in the middle of the restaurant, I will not go back to this location, I will continue to go to the one on Main.",1
"Not a great choice if you want to see a Doctor on the weekend. During the week is better but we didn't have any choice when my father had his emergency. We were lucky to see a Doctor once a day for 5 minutes and usually not until 1pm even though he had a 104 temperature, constant vomiting and they didn't know what was wrong with him. Even the nurses felt bad!",1
"One of my favorite Japanese tapa place in LV. I especially love the foie gras custard and foie gras with soy based sauce very rich . If you are in a group, it would be good to get at least one omakase. We have been going there for the past 4 years everytime we visit LV, and its been consistent everytime.",2
"Ordered Med Pizza for pick up. It was fresh, ready to go and done almost as ordered. Asked for extra sauce well done, they got half that correct so they get 4 stars instead of 5. Really like their sauce. Guy that checked me out ran around the counter to hold door open for me which was pleasantly unexpected. Price for med w 2 toppings was about 19 after tax. We'll be back again.",2
"The food is pricey, but it is well worth it! My sea bass was one of the best i've ever had! Great wines, great food, and great service. What more could you possibly ask for? Every 30 minutes or so the entire restaurant decor changes ceilings, paintings, walls, everything! It was a wonderful dining experience and I recommend this place to everyone. We will definitely be back!",2
If you are an international student or resident here in Edinburgh like myself you may be relieved to know that yes there is an Interflora here to send pretty bouquets across the globe. My grandparents were sweethearts on my 21st when I received a beautiful vase sent to my flat from here the delivery person was very professional and the flowers were gorgeous and lasted for days.,2
Don't come here! Been waiting 2 hours now with my 83 year old mother who has a broken hand. We have sat here watched more than 9 people go back and now the waiting room is reloaded with more than another 15 people. They are trying to tell me that everyone called ahead. So much for the words urgent and care. Certainly no dignity here. Horrible experience.,1
"Considering that this Japanese restaurant is in the middle of the desert, the sushi is quite fresh. The atmosphere is extremely nice and styled after many of the stylish restaurants you'd actually see in Tokyo. Really enjoyed eating at this restaurant and would highly recommend it to Japanese food lovers.",2
I can't even give them one star! First they were closed an hour and a half early. Second they don't even have signage to help you know where to go if you've never been here before. And third the big guy inside was kinda rude in letting me know they were closed. Definitely won't be coming here anymore. Not very customer service oriented.,1
Every time I check yelp for their hours I show up and they are closed. Today the sign was on door open and employees were sitting behind the counter eating and talking then tell me that they are closed despite yelp and their sign saying they were open. Doubt I'll be coming back for this horrible service. Update nCame to In and Out on camelback 101 received great service. Next time come here first.,1
"This gym is perfect for what I need. Great location, not overcrowded, and a plethora of equipment to choose from. There is no swimming pool but that is not an issue for me. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because they rent out parts of their facility for public use basketball courts. During these events things are a little too hectic and locker rooms can become a mess.",2
"The menu here offers the healthy options as well as some melted cheesey goodness options. Such as grilled cheese or pizza. I'm a big fan of their hummus, caramelized onions and chicken. Order anything with these items and you won't be disappointed. The prices are cheap for the amount of quality food you receive. Great service as well. nThanks Zoe's!",2
"Its a train wreck of food coming at my face and I can't look away! Anyplace that serves fried chicken for breakfast really gets me! If you're looking for a more manageable meal try the corned beef or any of the other hashes. They're still big portions, but look reasonable compared to everything else!",2
"I've been coming to this Ramiro's since the late 90's. I have always had a great experience when it comes to the food, always so fresh tasing! The staff is always friendly and smiling and their menudo on the weekends is definitely some of the best around. You can really taste the love and care that goes in to all of the food here.",2
"I've been a regular customer at Nando's since we moved to the neighborhood 5 years ago, and have never had a bad meal. Service is always great to be fair, one waitress there comes off a little gruff at times. But they have great Happy Hour specials, delicious house margaritas, generous portions, and tasty food. What's not to love?",2
"I like this place despite its location in a strip mall. The food is really quite good and the drink list even better. It had a good atmosphere and our service was very good. We had a server that was a bit eccentric, yet very friendly and knowledgable. He had us laughing and awaiting his return because he was so entertaining.",2
Pizza is pretty good. But everything else I have gotten is not so great! A turkey sandwich with 2 thin slices of meat. Not nice! Norterra location is good. But this one has some work to do! But plenty of draft beer just to hang at the bar! Service is slow. 30 min for food at lunch is not cool! Nice job on the build out. Nicest one yet! I will keep going and see if it gets better.,1
It's a great place for children to learn how to swim.Jennifer and her staff are professional and great with the children.Anyone who expects their kids to suddenly be Michael phelps after a few lessons need to realize they are teaching your kids to survive in the water and learn to swim not train for the Olympics.Also they teach a wonderful water aerobics class for the adults as well.,2
The only reason I'm giving this place any stars is because the girls are hot but don't ever use your credit card here. My boyfriend and I both had our card info stolen using our cards. They stole over 1k from me and 400 from my boyfriend. The place was packed and I'm sure everyone else who used a card dealt with the same bs,1
"Great Italian food, for 1 2 the cost of equivalent quality on the strip. Owner was there serving, and he was super friendly. Gave us tips on the area and traveling to Italy!.Nice family styled deli w a restaurant inside. Very warm and personable. Food was authentic, fantastic, fresh and in great qty.Will be back soon!",2
"Quite expensive for such a small bowl of food that isn't all that great. I had the Dan Daoodles 12 tax tip . The spice from the sauce overpowered the shrimp and the noodles I could barely taste them! You can get better Asian food in the strip, but if you're stuck at the Venetian, this is your best bet for something quick.",1
"Great easygoing place, no gimmicks, where neighbourhood people hang out. Not too noisy or touristy just right. Doesn't get too crowded or in your face like many other area spots. Qu u00e9bec microbrews, good selection of other stuff, friendly banter, good background music and nice relaxed vibe. Big screen goes on for Habs game.",2
I've recently been back to Sin City Sushi. I'm confident to give it another star now. The quality of the food and the in house service has improved. I feel like they are taking more time with the sit down customers than before. I will definitely go back. The cucumber salad ultimate tuna roll are great!,2
"Love La Condesa! They have a fantastic salsa bar with delicious, interesting salsas and a range of fantastic tacos something for everyone . The environment is cozy, albeit a little small. The only thing that would make it better is if it were BYOB they recently started serving alcohol . Phoenix needs more restaurants like this one!",2
"Cons so far, far outweigh the pros that not even free entry which we got and the hot DJ lineup don't be fooled by the hot DJ lineup! can save this place. If you decide to check it out not recommended , you may find yourself wondering where Vegas is hiding the attractive people, so make sure to also make arrangements to get into XS or Marquee that night.",1
"HORRIBLE SERVICE! The waitress we had, tattoos, dermals and all was as unfriendly as it gets. Asked for a ""reasonable "" bottle of wine, when the bill came it was 72.99. That is far from reasonable. She gave us the impression that we were a nuisance when ordering our food. Why exactly is she working there? Food was good, the meat and cheese is excellent.",1
Went to dinner here tonight and It was a very pleasant experience. We purchased the group on for 11 and our meal was 21.30. Food was delicious and service was very friendly. Our server checked on us in a timely manner and refilled our water and drinks. Very nice little restaurant and close to my house. Definitely will be returning here,2
"I had a wonderful experience here. Came in for a late breakfast, ordered the breakfast burrito, nothing complicated, but wonderful food. The owners are so kind and the chef owner is there because of his love of the culinary arts and passion for the joie de vivre that comes with the food culture and the camaraderie. That's what makes all the difference go support this wonderful local business!",2
I stayed in a deluxe room at this place and I can say I will never stay at this hotel again. Just because it's cheap doesn't mean that the quality of the room should be poor. Tv and the bathroom look so out dated. Imo this hotel needs a renovation badly. Only good thing about our room was the view if the strip. Right in front of Caesars Palace.,1
Today one of our trucks started over heating. I was in a pinch since its saturday and my normal mechanic was closed. Took the truck to Josh and the guys at Accurate. WOW the customer service was excellent. The got us in and out in a few hours. Friendly and highest level I have seen from a mechanics shop EVER. I will highly recommend them to everyone. Thanks for bailing us out on such short notice.,2
"This is based on only one visit, but I couldn't bring myself to go back. I ordered the create your own pasta dish. The food was cold when it came out, which is minus about 2 stars right away. The service is sub par as well. The not very friendly guy working there warmed my food up, likely in the microwave. It was still pretty unappetizing and I didn't finish it. One star for decent prices?",1
"I came back for seconds since I was staying at MGM! Their steak and eggs warm sandwich was good, but their tomato soup with parmesan was great! The sandwich was nice and warm and made on the spot! The soup stayed hot so be careful. You can also order half soup and half sandwich, so I had to try their grilled cheese with the tomato soup which was AWESOME! Affordable and located inside MGM Grand.",2
Incredibly delicious food full of lively cajun flavors and spices. Wait staff was friendly and informative. My only complaint was I was still very hungry after finishing my meal. I highly recommend the bronze shrimp and grits but the real treat that everyone should experience is the bananas foster bread pudding!,2
Good value a large pizza that's actually large for 5.95 pick up. I have tried a fee different pizza and would recommend the bacon pizza it goes well with their sweet Tomato sauce. The pepperoni is also good and the wings are good and the price is right. There is another older location off of grande ave hole in the wall but the food speaks for itself.,2
"Breakfast is my favorite meal here. I love the waffles, but had the eggs and corned beef hash. In spite of the fast food nature of the kitchen this place has great food. I do really like this restaurant, but advise that breakfast has the most consistently good food here. Lunch, and dinner can sometimes be an adventure.",2
Lunch wasn't too busy so I can't say that was a valid excuse for bad service. Got sat and ordered pretty quick. Drinks came pretty fast too. Appetizer never came and food took awhile for what we ordered. Must have sat under the heat lamp in back for awhile because everything was dry. I'm sorry but as a server you have 1 job. Will never come back.,1
"Cute hole in the wall place. Have the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. That's what I had, and I will be going back. I also had a blueberry coconut muffin. It was fresh that morning. Get it warmed up with butter. So everything bread here is homemade and made from scratch. That is just so hard to find. By the way they are Buckeye fans!",2
"love the decore and attention to detail, but the service was really bad. the shower wasn't attached right somehow so it squirted water everywhere in the bathroom. i asked for maintenance to address, but no one showed up in the 3 days i stayed there. no discount for the issue and barely an apology. i expect more from a motel 6 let alone a hotel that charged me 600 for a 3 night stay.",1
I have been coming here since I was little. Some people do not like the mom and pop restaurant because they are not that modern. I think these are places are great. This is a great place to go. They have a lot of good old fashioned comfort food. This place is very simple so if you are looking for a grand place this is not it. But good food and good people are always here. Very family freindly.,2
"These guys really hosed me on book of mormon tix, always go through the venue. Thomas on the phone was 13 needs some work on his social skills. Beware of stubhub. I should've listened to friends but I wanted those tickets n I learned the hard way, I want to save anyone else from a similar situation.",1
Very cool and different place! Waffles and hot dogs or both. I'm not really a hot dog fan but the waffles are amazing! They have a cinnamon flavor to them and you can put any toppings you want on in it. My favorite is peanut butter and honey. Great price and quick service. Definitely will be going back!,2
Chipotle is a distant memory to me now that I have been to Braddah's! The pig and mango corn salsa was awesomeness rolled into a soft warm burrito! The coconut bark was a delicious finish! My husband enjoyed a bowl with the most delicate flavorful fish in town! We are hooked! Staff was helpful let us taste test to make our selection perfect so thanks Jaime! we will be BACK!,2
"The bed was very soft and comfortable. The bathroom has 2 sinks, which was nice. And I liked the fancy controls for the lights and tv. The pool was relaxing and enjoyable too. My only complaint was that the low ceilings and the dark interior in the hallways made me feel a little claustrophobic. Overall, this is an excellent hotel.",2
"What can you say? It's a Pizza Hut. I always order carryout, it is always ready when I arrive and always made correctly. The staff seems a bit disorganized sometimes but they've always been friendly. You have to feel for the management, I know that they are tasked with managing ever more unreasonable demands from corporate. a high turn over rate and a bad corporate reputation.",2
"Love Chic Fil A love this location. Food is always great, the staff are super friendly my daughter loves meeting her friends here to eat play. The waffle fries are a huge hit with everyone I think it is awesome they give out balloons to the children . the only possible way to entice them away from the play area home! My favorite menu item is the chicken wrap dipped in their delicious spicy sauce ",2
My wife and I just go batty when we try to find a really good beakfast place on the west side. I do not think it exists. Anyway knowing it was going to be a sliver above Denny's we went to carrows. We got exactly what we expected. A sliver above Denny's. Oh well the hunt continues for a good breakfast on the west side.,1
"Try the Italian fried chicken.best IFC I have had in years. I purchased the 4 piece and it came with slaw, bread stick, wing leg thigh breast and a pound of fries.packaged up nice in a VERY high quality to go box. The flavor was perfect.the chicken was super moist and the outside was super crunchy. I know nothing about the pizza pie, but the chicken is unquestionable!",2
"This place is so good I don't think there will ever be a better Mexican ""fast food "" joint anywhere. I love everything about this place from the flesh tortillas, to the crazy good pork salad, to the super tart lime pie. I have eaten myself sick here so many times I can't count them. If you are looking for a great quick bite this is the place for you.",2
Been here an hour a half to get a new battery installed! If ur slammed you need to say that! I had family here with me who I sent home b c I thought it wld be fast. I wanted to buy tires guy said he'd get me a quote never did. Seriously? Sneaky business. I should've looked at their yelp b4 coming inside. mad sears I won't be getting tires here ,1
Our first visit here and we we're pretty happy with everything. Had domestic beer on tap with a salad bar and the pizza was really good. The thing I might suggest is to ditch the cheap paper plates and styrofoam salad bowls and up grade to either hard plastic or better disposable dishes. It's nice to find a sit down pizza place with a beer.,2
"The staff is great. They know me and my wife by name. In fact when I pull up to pick up my clothes, the staff is already getting my clothes ready before I even walk through the door. This location has a small town family business feel. The prices are fair and my clothes always look nice when I get them back. I go here every week.",2
"This place is amazing! It was my first time here because I am on a job out here with my Vegas firms team and if its your first time, they personally bring you a bowl of all three meats for you to try. Their pulehu steak was my favorite! This place is like a Hawaiian chipotle. They even have thwir own made salsas and sauces. Brilliant. I enjoyed it with my favorite hawaiian sun ",2
"I found this place to be pretty enjoyable. I had the smoked chicken over the southwest salad. Also had the wings with bbq sauce and the fried pickles. Don't think I'd order those again, but the salad was definitely great. It was a nice way to enjoy the bbq withough getting all weighed down with the heavy stuff.",2
I have an iron stomach and the sushi I had here put some chinks in it. Obviously something wasn't fresh. The service was good. nThe Toro Sashimi wasn't good due to the stringiness of the fish. It's supposed to melt in your mouth and be the best. So disappointing. nThe tempura and edamame was really good. nThe rolls were good but I can't remember which one. Next time I'll be going to BOA instead.,1
"horrible customer service. waited 20 minutes to get my eyebrows done as a walk in. they kept telling me just two minutes. they took 6 people ahead of me. so i stood up a collected my keys and wallet from the chair next to me and they didn't say a word so i just walked out. and there was dust everywhere. will never go back! if i could post no stars, i would.",1
"Both the beef chow fun wide noodle, and the mixed vegetable with lightly fried tofu, were excellent. The noodle dish was among the best I've had, which was portioned just right for three hungry people, and was free of any excess oil. The vege dish was a colorful medley of quality freshness and variety. Combined with quick and friendly service, I'll be back for more!",2
Not good for lunch. Atmosphere is too austre and quiet like trying to dine in church. they dont even pipe any music in. the lobster sliders were filled with about a tablespoon of lobster and at least that much mayonnaise. Fries had been sitting too long and gotten hard. Good service and good wine list but overall not worth the 70 pricetag for lunch.,1
"I put this right up there with Chipotle in terms of quality. Prices are relatively the same. Chips queso are amazing. I had the 3 tacos, one chicken steak grilled pork . The grilled pork, wasn't too great, but the steak and chicken were, they tasted fresh, and juicy, even 30 min before closing time.",2
They called to say my pizza would be later than the 45 minutes they originally advised. I'm okay with that except my pizza arrived cold. Microwaved pizza just isn't good. Especially when 1 pizza is 25. Not worth the price by any stretch I'd recommend a chain over them sadly. At least your bad pizza would be cheap that way.,1
"After spending thousands of dollars and years in violin teachers we finally came to the understanding that not all teachers are created equal and that you better do you homework before investing your time, your money, time and effort into lessons ANYWHERE. I you want your child to become an accomplished musician look elsewhere. I wish we had known nMs. Berns is very nice.",1
Disgusting. fries bad.ugh. my whole party didn't seem too enthused about this place. and it's location sucks right smack dab in the middle of a PACKED food court inside the gigantic maze which is the Venetian. we had such high expectations after seeing this franchise on Undercover Boss. what a disappointment. disgusting.,1
"The worst resort I have ever stayed out. No service, no consideration for guest. Just awful. I would never return here, a motel 6 is vastly superior. This place just stinks to hell and back. Terrible, Just crappy in every way. Sleep on the street, you'll do better. I wish I could give it minus 5 stars. I wouldn't stay here again if they paid me.",1
"In my life, I easily could have stayed in more than 200 hotels. None of them have made such an amazing impression like this one. Include the Mandarins in other countries. The service is out of this world. The water pressure of the shower is strong. Free yoga and Pilates classes everyday. The in room dining is yummy and they don't take forever either. I LOVE this hotel. Very impressive.",2
Just stopped in for the first time at this location. It's right around the corner from where I live and I'm in heaven. I got a wonderful Cobb Chicken salad and I couldn't ask for more. Wonderful service and great atmosphere. The Decor of the place is great and relaxing. Great place for dinner or lunch and even breakfast for coffee etc.,2
"The wings are ok better than the miserable offerings at Quaker Steak and Lube. My gripe is the service. No matter how simple my order is I never get in and out in under twenty minutes. I just don't get it you sell wings, so why does it seem like someone has to go kill a chicken and look up the recipe to get me some?",1
Liberty Tech and Tire saved my life and my road trip. Rashid took such good care of me and he was incredibly friendly. He is the owner and he was there working on a Sunday. Would highly recommend to anyone living in the area and anyone driving through with car trouble. This place is honest and really does care. Thanks Rashid!,2
"This place is often on my domestic route for groceries they have quality meat for low prices, and their ready to go food is the best quality cost I know of from a market chain. Even their microwave bachelor meals are excellent! They always have great specials and a 10 25 off coupon in circulars. This store is always very clean and cheery.",2
"Very clean. Nice room stayed in a junior suite with family room and connecting room separated by heavy soundproof doors. Very quiet. Hot tub jacuzzi in room nice amenities but no shower cap, sewing kit, bathrobes, etc. but there was washing machine and full kitchen. Central convenient location. Minus was the ten dollar a day wifi fee. And hardly any cellular internet service in room.",2
"Even if you are trying NOT to like the co op like some other Yelpers it's impossible not to appreciate this place! Lovely produce, great bulk section, bountiful organics, and a deli that can kick any grocer's arse. It's really worth it to get a membership which I think is reasonably priced , if you are going to shop there more than a few times a year,",2
"As Gold Club members, we are pleased with the service provided to us at Hertz McCarran Airport. Wayne was especially helpful as he offerred to bring us to the airport instead of catching the shuttle. Thanks Wayne! We rented the Mercedes C250.nice car.drives well.but a little small. No problems. We'll use Hertz again.",2
The cupcakes are average. I got the red velvet and it had a strange taste. The other one I got was dry. The staff were rude as well. I bought 3 cupcakes and if you buy four or something you get a deal so I stepped out of the building then stepped back in because I changed my mind and they made me pay full price for the fourth one. I will never go back.,1
"First time visit. Went for moo shoo chicken. The portion was small, so I didn't need the 4 pancakes. They used something like beans sprouts rather than cabbage, etc for the veggies, weird. The chicken was little tiny chips of chicken. Other things on the menu may b great, but my meal was lousy and my first time experience will be my last",1
"HORRIBLE Experience! Service So bad in fact that for the first time I've been motivated to open up a Yelp account to write a review. The reason it gets 2 Stars instead of 1 is for the TVs. For viewing a game great, but if you want food service you can do far better. Beer selection is also very limited. Very disappointed.",1
I learned a lot and had tons of fun. The instructor was thorough and the food was amazing. The spices and rubs were southwest spicy and left you wanting seconds and thirds. The sauces were delightful. I mever knew I could make 5 BBQ sauce taste like a million . This class was well worth the money and time.,2
"If you are around the age of fourteen this is a fun place, but not so much for the older folks. If you are The Big Lebowski type league bowler then find a smaller venue to do your thing. They have midnight black light bowling here and my nephew loves to come here with his friends. It is a safe environment with security, so don't fret.",1
I don't think we will be eating at this joint again. We have stayed at Aria many times and wanted to give this place a try plus because we had a 75 Hotel Credit from Aria. We had to wait to be seated.no one was in line! There were people running around but no one came to our table for 10 min. We could have gotten better service and food at Denny's or iHOP. We DO NOT recommend Cafe Vettro!,1
"This is a great little place to find interesting unique furniture decor. Really, some of the items you will not see anywhere else. Some is tacky fabulous and some beautiful. I like the upstairs area, it feels like a Raiders of the Lost Arc treasure trove, IF, Harrison Ford was an historian in the Vegas Lounge Lizard era. It is great.",2
"This was the worst ""hotel "" or motel I have ever stayed at! I sincerely hope no one stays here ever again! We could here everything I neighbors said and did, including them hocking loogies! We demanded our money back and 1 MONTH later finally got refunded! this place is a DIVE and they steal your money I agree, this place deserves ZERO stars!",1
With all the auto parts stores here in Vegas it was hard to find a store that wasn't run by kids that know nothing about cars or shady parts. Finally I found a store I can trust and is very knowledgeable. Plus they go out of their way to make sure they get the part when they say they will. Thank you Cindy and your sales team for great service.,2
"Don't waste your time here the bar won't be open much longer. Service is beyond slow. They do have hot girls working there, but good luck trying to get one to serve you. They are too busy texting or talking to their friends who they feed free drinks too. The bar has the right idea, but just has a poor management team. Bar is heavy on the MMA dbags and Jersey Shore wannabes.",1
"Usually this pizza is really good but lately, it's kinda sucked. The pizza seems to get smaller everytime I order it. Also, they started to put rosemary on their garlic knots.ew, I mean, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe order again but if not, I will have to find a new spot pizza re.",1
"I had my side ribs done by Willy. He recreated a drawing that i brought in which looks even better. It was a cover up of a small tat from 10 years ago. My new tat looks pretty cool as hell. So if you want a bad ass tat with great details and not cartoon looking tat drawn by a five year old, Swing by here. Its worth every penny. lol.Thanks again Bad Apple.",2
"I loved it, parking and all, after all, they had Palak Paneer! Mmmmm. It was tasty. I spent a lot, but I was ok with the occasional splurge. the second trip, i again bought my hit foods Palak Paneer and it had obviously gone over. Ever have whoopsies after green Indian cuisine? It's off my list now. Forever.",1
Great coffee if they get your order right. Problem is it's usually only about 50 of the time. Breakfast is good if you have time to wait for it. Skip lunch though. There are better places in the area to eat for the same price. Staff is always very friendly but the line is always chaotic. They definitely need more training and or more staff.,1
"Not the best hotel I've stayed in I would give the room 2.3 3 stars , but the service was amazing. I came here on a business trip and my executive assistant booked my stay for the day before I flew into town. Therefore when iarrived my reservation was canceled. Amy, at the front desk went above and beyond to find me a room, she was friendly and professional. It was a great experience.",2
"So perfect. They have empanadas ranging from pulled pork, to chocolate, to garlic plantain. The garlic plantain is the most delicious thing, just perfect. All the ones that are 2.75 are 2 5, which makes this a very reasonable price for how fresh and tasty it is. Can't say enough good things about it.",2
"We have never been here before so we asked what the supposedly owner recommends. He pointed to his ridiculous menu board which is placed inconveniently high above his head. his comments were not helpful so we ordered a shrimp with chili verde salsa burrito. It was huge, salty and bottle tasting. I dont know how they stay in business for mediocre food, but horrible customer service.",1
"I have been here about 10 times, everytime except my last visit has been 5 stars ayce sushi with 3 star service. The lasttime I went may be my last though. When in the bathroom I saw a server use the toilet and NOT WASH HIS HANDS, I was beyond disgusted and just flat out left. GROSS. Sucks cause this was always my go to sushi spot in Vegas! Just thought others should know what I saw.",1
"The staff is extremely professional and extremely friendly and helpful. I had my flowers re delivered multiple times because the recipient was not present and they were great with their communication and customer service. Most importantly, the flowers turned out fantastic and everyone loved them. I highly recommend Tiger Lily!",2
"The only reason i can ever forsee coming back to Alize will be for the view. Service sucked, and they got my ribeye wrong! But, with the right company even a sucky restaurant makes it seem like a great meal. That's all im going to say about Alize, because if i dont have anything nice to say, i'd rather say nothing! Btw no one in our party of four raved about this meal, and we're all foodies ",1
Don't get me wrong the food is great here however I never get good customer service here. Today Davey the cashier and Alicia the bagger spent their time talking about the latest sprouts gossip while ringing me in. This has happened many times. I brought my boyfriend this trip to sell him on sprouts and the good produce but we couldn't even get a Hi from the cashier ,1
"The El Cortez Is what I like to call ""The Pass Thur "". no one actually hangs out here, we just park here because It's free and It's not too far from the downtown bars. The cafe has 5 Breakfest which Is not too shabby but don't be surprised If you see a ""working girl "" slap her pimp or shady characters lurking around.",1
"Good thing is no line. But bad thing is it's the dirtiest Starbucks I've ever been in. Floor was filthy, behind the counter and throughout the seating area, trash was everywhere. Counter was sticky, newspapers strewn everywhere. I've never in my life seen a Starbucks so dirty and I've been in many .",1
"I am pleased to say that this is a very delectable fast food greek restaurant. The food always seems to be freshly cooked to order, with phenomenal service in hand. It's a welcoming ""mom and pop "" restaurant with well priced meals and entr u00e9es. I recommend the gyros Niro's serve, as they are the best locally.",2
"A really neat place with great food. This was my first stop in Edinburgh, and it couldn't have been a better way to start off. Had a great meal, a cold beer, and got to watch black and white, slient cartoons projected onto one of the walls. Wish it was closer to home so I could stop by all the time.",2
Just had lunch with two teenagers and everyone loved their food. Double bacon burger was a huge hit especially the yummy bun. Another had wings.buffalo style. And I of course had my usual pulled pork tacos which were fresh and had great textures. We all had the Mac and cheese.fantastic way to warm up on a cold afternoon!,2
"No way this place gets 4 stars. The best thing about this pizza is the price and you get what you pay for. We got a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and the pepperoni bites. Both were bland and pretty tasteless. Costco pizza is way better, heck a Digionos would blow this one away. Skip it and save your money.",1
"Hands down some of the BEST BBQ I have had in a LONG time! This is now my staple go to place! Service was AWESOME! Food was PERFECT! The corn bread was like CAKE! The bacon potato salad was like Mom's but with BACON! The Mac n Cheese, was on point! Again, the experience and the service was just AMAZING!",2
"This place sucks ASS! The food SUCKS and they only got me in the place through misleading advertising a happy hour that they lead you to believe is one thing, you order what you THINK is on HR and then.WAMOOOO! HUGE BILL the owner threatens to then call the police on you unless you pay up. PASS and save your money for Goldies or Zipps right up and down the street.",1
"First impression. Rude service. Waitress took order across table. Waitress also did not take responsibility for order. Said she didn't know since someone else took order. Waitress name Geo. Fish was stringy. Only good thing about this place is price.but then again, I guess you get what you pay for.definitely will not return.",1
If you have a sweet tooth like I do this bakery is a gem. You will find about any and every choice of baked good and sweets you could want. I know they have savory options as well but frankly not a reason I go there. Their fruit tart is excellent as is everything else I have tried. It is a must stop anytime I am in Vegas. Located in the Paris Casino.,2
"If the reviews were based strictly on food, Carolina's would get 5 stars. My brother and his family took us there for the ""best Mexican food in Phoenix "". I wouldn't have gone if it wasn't for my family's experience there. It's in a sketchy neighborhood and looks really run down, but looks can be deceiving. The food was amazing!",2
"Clean but definitely overpriced. Fixed two brokeails and changed my polish. Was charged 14, when i gave her 20, she didnt even offer to bring me the change. And she kept the whole 20. I would have tipped 20 but not 6 dollars. It turns me off so much, i dont see myself coming back here anymore. Salon stuffs were nice to caucasian customers while they were kinda blunt and rude to me. Yuck.",1
"A pipe smokers paradise! This tiny shop has a dazzling selection of new and vintage pipes, along with the most extensive selection of tinned tobaccos I've ever seen outside of a Web site. Even better, the staff is extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and happy to chat. This is what a pipe shop should be and what virtually none of them are anymore.",2
"I don't care if you're on a first date, a vampire, or some kindof strange gum or deodorant professional whose job it is to smell good all the time, you order the Bad Breath Burger because it is the most garlicy cheesy delicious piece of cow you will ever have. I miss this place so much and tell everyone I know to go there for the burger alone, but everything else on the menu is terrific as well.",2
"The place is great if you are looking to not be in a casino. The valet is great, the rooms are very comfortable and the location is fine. It would for sure be better if there were a coffee shop closer as the walk is about 1 2 mile. We ate at the hotel resturant and it was very good. I will for sure return. Thanks",2
"Food was pretty good, very nice patio, but service was terrible. It was so bad that it spoiled the food and ambiance. Sorry I will not be bad it is a shame, as really wanted to like this place based on the reviews, but too many other great places in Scottsdale to come back to a place that does not care about service.",1
"This place SUCKS! I only stayed to see how long the wait was to get to the cashier, 26 minutes, thats how long. I can't believe how Wal mart treats its customers. None of the ""speedy "" lanes were open. I hate giving my money to these people, I go out of my way to spend my money elsewhere. I hope Wal mart is reading this, oh wait.they don't care!",1
"This place makes Panda Express seem like high quality fine dining. Probably the most bland, tasteless chowmein I have ever had. Even soy sauce couldn't help it. Server had to dig around to find chicken in the kung pao dish. To top it off, it was about 10 more than Panda Express would have been for the same dishes. Very disappointed, won't be back, avoid at all costs.",1
"Don't let the country decor atmosphere fool you, my expectations were not met. Real country has thick hardy tasty beef not these thin bland ones. The onion rings and zucchini fries aren't as good as they look. Batter has a funny after taste. Luckily my girl order the chicken avocado sandwich, which was delicious! I took half ",1
"After about 15 visits to this location over this last year it's time to cry uncle . Even with an occasional free breakfast due to punchcard, this place is off our rotation. Cold food , unfriendly servers and managers. Sometimes you get a water pitcher, sometimes not. Portions get smaller and smaller with at least two price hikes. Sorry good egg, you've gone rotten.",1
"I've tried several places in this area for good Chinese food and by far this is the best I've had. The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. I ordered cashew chicken and it was delicious. I have never had it with peppers before, so I just took them out. I definitely recommend trying it and I plan to return.",2
"I went in to Carmines for a Chicken Parm dinner and a pizza. When i got home to eat , the chicken parm was dry and like rubber it tasted old it was horrable so threw it out and had a slie of pizza and that tasted like a burnt dejorno pizza. Any way i wouldnt recomend that place to any one just buy a frozen pizza and cook it yourself it would be better",1
"I have absolutely nothing had to say about this place. A cheap, bring your own wine schezuan place where the food is TO DIE FOR! I love it! The portions are big and soooooo tasty! I usually get the ""combo A "" which comes with a soup and chicken with vegetables on a bed of noodles and it costs about 15. Totally worth it! Why even consider going anywhere else for schezuan?",2
"Went for dinner last night.The food was awesome, best meal we've had at this location since it opened. Had the green chili burro tasted amazing and very tender.Wife had tostada, taco dinner, excellent! Frankie was our server and he did a great job. Only one complaint, the back ground music was a tad loud.",2
"Honestly. Lifting weights next to some privileged, yet ungreatful 12 yr old whose mom dragged him along while she takes a class, is not my cup of tea. Atleast it was the motivation to build a gym in my own home.adults only! I want to work out, I don't want a country club, nursery school, or a scene to be seen. Too much!",1
"I love this place! I have been to a couple of other spice shops in other cities, and this has the best selection, by far. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and always suggests things I haven't thought to try. I've become a regular, and it's always nice to go in and see familiar faces. I send all of my friends here.",2
Would love to have had the opportunity to try this place but walked in a few minutes before 11 door was unlocked at the Bell location. I was told upon entering that they did have all the pizzas out yet and that I would need to come back at later when they were open. I ended up going down the block and had a great slice at Barro's,1
"It's a little place I think over in terminal A next to the only brewery bar in the airport. The service was good but I didn't like my sweet Italian sausage. It came in a warm bun with peppers and onion. There are so many other places in the airport that are better for the price. This sweet sausage cost with tax, 6.50ish.",1
"First with the good, every tasted good. Now the bad one the price to start and the portions. The pizza we purchased was 40.00 and maybe should have been 20.00. The large pizza is the size of any regular small pizza. We tryed it because it was new to us and will never be back. Don't waste your time or money try Pullanos a real pizza place.",1
"It was a pleasant surprise to find that they serve local and organic foods. I ordered the organic grass fed burger and It was great, cooked perfect, and the service was wonderful. I don't normally order desert but when I saw they had bread pudding I said what the heck. It was by far the best bread pudding I've ever had and I will definitely be back to have it again.",2
"Nice ambiance and friendly staff were not enough to compensate for my over cooked steak. Also ordered the ""poblano and parmesan "" creamed corn, wouldn't recommend it unless you just want corn and bread crumbs. It was flavorless. The best part of our meal were the crab cakes. Ruth Cris is a safer bet for my money.",1
"I have no complaints. I am new to the world of vision correction. The staff, and Dr. Meek are great. They talked with me, made me feel comfortable and didn't pressure me into high frames or lens upgrades. They have a decent selection of frames, the office is comfortable, and the people are nice. There IS an elevator, if you can't do stairs. It's to the left as you look at the building.",2
"Wow! What a little hidden gem! Their donuts and smoothies are amazing! I've been there 3 times over the last week at different times of the day and the donuts are always fresh! The prices are great! They have several flavors for the smoothies, so far my favorite is coconut banana, delicious! I'm so excited this is in our neighborhood! The staff is also very nice and helpful. Wonderful place!",2
"First off, I don't expect a great meal in an airport. That being said this may have been the worst meal I have had in a long, long time. All I ordered was soup and a caeser salad. The soup was nasty. Some sort of tomato based tortilla soup that tasted like canned tomatoes. The caesar salad had Italian dressing! What a bunch of crap",1
While waiting to get my car fixed at goodyear I asked if this place was good and was told yes so I came over. While waiting the cook came out wiping snot from his nose with his hands and arms and proceeded to blow his nose with tissue never washed his hands and went back to cooking. GROSS! Needless to say I left.,1
Terrible customer service if you can even call it customer service From start to finish it was bad. The pro shop being the worst. Followed by the sprinkles running with no one to shut them off on at least half the holes. Take your money elsewhere. .To many other courses to play with much more customer oriented staff.,1
"I'm a huge fan of Japanese food, but this place really, ugh, deserves no stars. Waaaaaay overpriced! Sashimi is sooo thinly sliced with 4 6 pieces, and was not ""fresh "". The waiter was not attentive at all. You would think at a nice Restaurant like this, you'd get better quality food AND service, but nope. Not here. nWill not go here again.",1
"Dr Bennett has been great! I found her because of yelp as I am 28 weeks pregnant and wanted to find a chiropractor who is knowledgeable about pregnant women. She has been extremely flexible with her schedule and mine. I went in because I was unable to move my neck and had bad hip pain, and after the first week I felt great!",2
Waitress super rude All my friend did was ask to change her order from a 16 app to the au poir When we asked for the manager he was completely ignorant. We Have been there Several times prior. It was like they Were Trying to be rude for no reason. II cannot believe all the good reviews here because I've heard many stories about how terrible they can be.,1
"Wer nachts Pizza oder Pasta essen m u00f6chte, geht ins zentral, nahe der Fu u00dfg u00e4ngerzone, gelegene La Strada. Wer gute K u00fcche sucht nicht. Das d u00fcrfte neben der wenig charmanten Bedienung auch der Grund sein, warum tags u00fcber nicht viel los ist, trotz moderater Preise. Publikum hungrige Nachtschw u00e4rmer.",1
Other than a nice patio there is nothing to recommend this place. Food is not good. The pork in the vermicelli was fatty and the veggies consisted of iceberg lettuce and a few carrot sticks. The service was incredibly slow and the music so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation. If they want to be a night club go for it but as a restaurant not cool.,1
"Been here multiple times, never disappointed. only for breakfast I'm a breakfast fanatic, it's my favorite meal to eat out. Breakfast sandwich is a good size. Husband had the Hawaiian Breakfast, and he could barely eat it all. Tater tots are crisp and delicious and I'm not a big tater tot person. Nice patio, relaxing and enjoyable.",2
"They deserve much more business I wish it was located further north so it could be a carry out option. nFood is excellent must try the Tottie Rolls. Great option for a group that wants Asian but can't decide if they want Chinese, Thai , Vietnamese they do all very well. Great bartending excellent cocktails as well. Great atmosphere very upscale yet comfortable setting.",2
"Last time i went to vegas with a group of gf's they kept talking about these burgers at ""that one restaurant in Paris "" so finally after alot of talk we went to go try it out. The burgers were quite yum.not your average burgers ut speciatly stuff with special cheeses and what not. the burgers were yum and they come with a bucket of yummy fries BUT i still think the counter is better!",2
"I went to Majerle's for happy hour with my buddies about 6 months ago. The beer was cold and I ordered the nachos. They tasted ""different "" but I didnt think much about it until about an hour later. I ended up puking my insides out for the next two days. Needless to say I still cant eat nachos anywhere. I think I will not be returning.",1
"The pizza here is way undercooked. It seems to be a theme in Pittsburgh in general to not cook the pie long enough for it to crisp up and the cheese to get golden. The sauce was pretty generic and tasted like cheap stuff from a jar. The price was fair at about 2 a slice. The workers at the counter were friendly. However, the pizza itself is just doughy rubbery and pretty bland.",1
"The food here is fair and the service was very poor. The waiter took our appetizer order and we didn't see him again for another 30 minutes. What should of been quick lunch turned into a 1 1 2 hour meal. The guacamole is not very good, it doesn't seem made to order and that's a shame. I'm sure that the food and service is much better than what we experienced.",1
"Family owned and operated and you can certainly tell. The food was over the top Delicious and the family atmosphere made it all the better. I ordered the enchilada with a taco.perfect! i can't tell you how many Mexican restaurants I go to that ""say "" they are authentic and then to be fully disappointed. You won't find that here.Nope, it's amazing! Can't wait to go back again!",2
"Went here today for the first time with friends. The lady taking our order was EXTREMELY rude to us! She should not be working in the front! We were all so shocked by the way we were treated, it was hard to enjoy our lunch. Pulled pork sandwich was good, but will not be going back because of the horrible attitude this lady had.",1
"Best doughnut around by far! Forget about the toppings, the dough itself is delicious! I love sweets and ever since I tasted this treats, I can't get enough, the staff is always friendly and the owner is really cool if you happen to stop by when he's there, you'll get a free sample i recommend this place 100 ",2
"Not baaaaad! Not bad at all. The dumplings are awesome especially with the So Original sauce and the guys that run the cart are super friendly and professional. The one thing I didn't love was that my ginger salad was a little heavy on the dressing. I'll definitely be back, though, and I'm excited to try some of their other kinds of dumplings and soups.",2
"Absolutely loved this place. Had the chips and salsa pico de Gallo , cheese quesadilla, 2 Bombay tacos and 2 Shanghai tacos, and mint tea. Everything was super fresh, well seasoned and cooked perfectly. I didn't have any taco soggyness issues that a few reviewers mentioned. Great price too! Service was prompt, helpful and friendly ",2
"We were checking out College's this summer and had breakfast Einstein's. It was really good, Breakfast Bagel w Turkey Sausage the kids got bagels w CC plus some of the Cinnamon Twist. The best part is my son joined their Text Club and got his Bagel w CC FREE. If my daughter chooses Pitt or Carnegie then we will be back!",2
"What makes Alta Mesa Chiropractic above average for me is the care that I get from Dr. Michone. She has a very uncommon way with people. She listens and hears things I'm dealing with way beyond the surface. It makes a big difference in my overall health which is amazing especially when what I had been used to was the wham bam experience, out in 2 minutes, kind of chiropractic appointment.",2
This place is fun. You never know what you will find. It is fun just browsing. I found 10 great CD's for a buck each. I even found a cool pair of reading glasses. Last year I donated large appliances to them and they pick up. You don't even have to be there. They also have a lot of books separated by type to help you find what you want,2
"We came here for the shave ice found out they have so much more. They sell all kinds of snacks, desserts, pupus, and even boba. I only got the chance to try the shave ice with ice cream and azuki beans , pork hash, and poi mochi. They even have a kids table w toys a tv w cartoons playing. I will definitely be back to try their cakes, malasadas, guri guri, coco puffs, and boba.",2
Happy Hour Prices are great! nThe food NOT so great nEvery single roll dish was covered with sauce. I was let down because everyone hyped it up. This sushi restaurant is definitely mixed. Beware when you order the happy hour dishes you get the NOT so happy servings of fish more rice and cucumbers . The server was friendly. The food is definitely not good enough for round two.,1
"Great BBQ and Service nWe went here on a very busy Saturday afternoon. Got seated very quickly. We ordered one of the combo plates. It was just enough for the 3 of us. Turkey was a little dry,but the pulled pork and ribs were great. Good sweet tea as well. Everyone was polite and attentive. nParking can be challenging.",2
"We had the Basel Duck and it was not bad, it was awful. I complained but the response was it wasn't their fault. They refused to make any concessions. We were charged almost 40 and we didn't eat the duck because it sucked. Be aware. There people take no responsibility for serving a bad meal I will never go back to this place.",1
"Flies, flies and more flies.when you have to use your menu to keep all the flies at bay you know there is a major problem.the fondue was totally avg. Culinary Dropout's version is way better.Didn't eat anything because of the flies. The waiter with the bad attitude didn't improve things.have a drink in side at the bar and move on.",1
"Maybe it's the fact that I'm sick and therefore am not in the mood for incompetence, but I find myself quite displeased with this place. I had ordered the egg and tomato noodle. What I received was hot water with a sprinkle of chicken broth noodles and some tomatoes sprinkled inside with an oily fried egg on top. All this costed me 7.99. Just. No.",1
"We were at Jamba Juice and decided to stop and get something to eat, had really been wanting to try this place since they opened. When we walked in the hostess said we couldn't bring outside drinks in. I had just bought a smoothie so we walked out. I won't be back to try this place, that is an extremely stupid reason to turn away business.",1
We frequent this establishment. Always have good service and food. This time however was amazing. Our server was very friendly and outgoing and always ensured we had something to drink. We tried the cougar roll due to others recommending it on yelp it was the best roll I've had yet. We will be ordering it again as it was quite original and refreshing as well.,2
I am very happy with the haircut I got I was trying to grow out my pixie haircut and the lady cut my hair into a very stylish bob. All for 17 which is a steal when you know the average haircut in Montreal is more around 80 . nShe asked me how I wanted it done and most importantly the length I wanted to keep. nI have an other appointment there in 2 weeks and I am looking forward to it.,2
"Very upscale and intimate feeling when you walk up the stairs of the CatHouse in Luxor. The drinks were reasonably priced. Very nice ambiance, decor and furniture. The sound system is top notch you can feel the floor and furnitures shaking with the music beat. The lingerie model dancing was a very good show. Overall it was a pretty fun experience and lots of Vegas spirit in the air!",2
"Not good. The patio is top notch for relaxing if the weather's good but I couldn't shake that chain feeling when inside. Table and chairs had a slightly sticky feeling to them nice, eh? . Food was typical pre cooked, oven heated dollop of too much grease and cheese. Not impressed. It's a shame cause the garden and even the nachos salsa had me expecting big things.",1
"Had an amazing time at the show. I sat in the second row, behind the love seats. I loved that they play and include the audience. My boyfriend was picked on multiple times and I thought it was hilarious. This was my first time in vegas and the first show I saw. It was amazing. I loved it and would go over and over again. Expensive but a great time.",2
"The pho here is a bit better than Pho Kim Long's pho, even though it is more oily. I haven't found a better place than this so far. The service is always good when we go here. The vermicelli dishes like bun are pretty good here too I love pouring all the fish sauce they give in it! hehe . Anyone have any suggestions of a better place in Vegas?",2
I love to be in a place who everything for you. I would like to go to a one stop store compared to going to a lot of store wherein that is very much time consuming. This is my first choice every time the mood to renovate overcomes me. It's really my personal choice. The service is wonderful and they have equally great things to offer.,2
"This place is pricey but what isn't in Vegas? My boyfriend and I were strolling drunkenly lurching around the strip and decided to stop in for a bite to eat. We shared fried mac and cheese amazing and not greasy at all and the club sandwich fresh veggies, high end bacon, and yummy cranberry bread . The perfect meal to fuel an evening of heavy drinking, foolishness, and depraved shenanigans!",2
"Finally went to this restaurant, now I understand the hype! I loved what I had ordered. The Thai corn chowder is awesome so flavorful. The flat bread with hummus delicious the hummus had a citrus taste to it . The avocado maki roll was also great. Service was excellent. We sat outside on the balcony beautiful and comfortable.",2
"Staff don't really acknowledge the fact that you're there, aside from when they're trying to add on services. I guess they're used to groups of people going together, instead of going by themselves. Either way, the service was sub par, I kinda got rushed out at closing time and ended up smudging my nails.",1
Both my father and I enjoyed this show a lot. I think it's good for all.ages. If you have children that get scared easily be warned that there are a few scary charaters in a few scenes. But all in all it is visually impressive some acts are breathtaking and the music was awesome. Modern meets chinese. You could tell a lot of hard work and creativity went into making this spectacular show happen!,2
"We arrived at Los Reyes and was promptly seated. After about ten minutes the waitress came to take our order. We ordered one pi u00f1a colada and two margaritas. Come to find they were non alcoholic, which was not apparent when ordering from the menu. The food was as u00ed as u00ed and service was mediocre at best. Will not be returning.",1
"Wow what a great little place to have lunch and get a way from the strip. Korean infused hotdogs that are amazing and full of flavor. Had the angry dog, Santa Fe, and the west cost dog. Each one had the amazing flavor of a premium hotdog and the favors of the additional toppings. If you are coming here, come hungry and don't be afraid to try different hotdogs. But a great one is the angry dog.",2
A friend and I choose to grab a quick smoothie after a workout. Upon going into the store the men behind the counter were having rude conversation and putting that before the customers. After receiving our smoothies which were over priced for the quality they tasted artificial and not fresh. Overall not a good experience. Tropical Smoothie is more refreshing and pocket friendly.,1
"I absolutely love this bar! The classic arcade games combined with the availability of new xbox and ps3 games, the dancefloor, dj and friendly staff make this my favorite weekend hangout. The clientele are so varied that it makes people watching even better than the average bar. Where else in Vegas can you let your nerdy flourish?",2
This place is amazing! Not only is the Owner so nice and patient the place is so cozy and up to date with technology! You can bring people to experience your 4d ultrasound because the room is BIG! nI was on the fence of doing the 4d ultrasound but we decided to do it twice and it was such a beautiful experience! nPrices are reasonable and you will be treated like the Queen that you are!,2
"This staff could not interact with us less. We intrtoduced ourselves by name. Nothing. Got a refill when our beers were low. One star. These girls stare at the bar top and really seem to engage with only those who are regulars or ""tippers "". Being in the industry I feel badly giving 10 percent but there was NO interaction that would make me give them anything more.",1
My husband and I had an awesome dinner at Ticoz! Our server Andrew was excellent too! We order the Blue Corn Enchiladas and Coconut Curry Rice both were amazing! The place was busy and they still had us served withing 20 min. Parking was a bit tight.but well worth it! We use a living Social deal this was our first time. We will be back soon!,2
"I don't go to Mesa often, but when I do.it's for this place right here! I had a difficult time finding delicious Mexican food that served Lengua tacos and this place does it justice.and they got the salsa bar too with the spicy carrots. It's a hole in the wall and that's what I love about this authentic place.",2
"i'ts hard to give a place where you see a lot of boob a bad review, but i have to. the food is pretty crappy. some english irish beer on tap, but i'm not a huge fan of those. it's all mainstream stuff you can find at safeway. i guess not a bad place to get a beer and watch a game if there's no other choice and you have't seen 1 2 a boob in 6 months. but i wouldn't go out of my way to go here.",1
"Front desk guy could not have been ruder or less welcoming. The concierge was wonderful however. Experience was so so from the hot tub having too much chlorine and ruining our bathing suits general manager did little to replace cost of all the damage , to breaking out in a skin rash also from the hot tub, to the spa showers being broken!",1
"I had dinner last week with my wife. nThe food was excellent. We had spring rolls with peanut sauce. ngrilled shrimp appetizer, shrimp had a nice grilled flavor! nwife had some sort of chicken with rice and I tried the Cat fish stew that was fantastic IT was pan sauteed some how and simmered in a thick sauce nI'm getting hungry thinking about it!",2
"If I had the option to put no stars I would. This is by far the worse Mexican restaurant I have ever been too! Nice staff but terrible tasting food and very hot small place. Again I caot stress on how terrible the food was. I went with friends, family, children included and no one was satisfied. Try at your own risk.",1
"WTF? I always come here with a big group of friends and just yesterday, they turned us away because one of the girls with us didn't have her id to show that she was 21! We told him that she doesn't drink and that we were here for the food and he was like, nope, you can't come in cause she can't prove that she's 21. Seriously, wtf?",1
"Thievery Alert I sent an envelope from this USPS to Nebraska. Somewhere along the way that envelope was open, 2 memory cards specially packaged inside were removed, the envelope was resealed and sent on it's way where it arrived empty. I don't know who stole the memory cards but the trail starts at this USPS. I hope sharing my experience saves others from a similar problem.",1
"I have eaten at Bell' Italia several times and have never had a bad experience. The food is excellent and the staff is very nice. There butternut squash with the vodka sauce is delicious. I have also had pizza chicken parmesan. Oh yes, I have become a limoncello connoisseur, and there's is very smooth and tasty, I would have had two, but I was driving. ",2
"This place sucks , poor service, she never once looked at me. just kept looking at what ever she was doing at the counter , seems like they could care less if your in the store or not. And 10 just to try on a wig , I wouldn't pay to try clothes on I'm sure not paying to try a wig on. 10 for each wig you try on ! Business's trying to make a buck where they shouldn't usually end up loosing a buck.",1
"Great service and incredible food. I travel a good deal and always look for non chain places to eat. This is a small chain, but the service was probably the best I have seen in 6 months. Food was plentiful and fresh. Also a great selection of wines to choose from. Will be back on my next visit to PHX.",2
"Slim pickings. Teeny, tiny, dirty crab legs. Even the salad bar was sad. All the meats were dry and overcooked. I give this place one star because they have a pretty good dessert section, I suppose it's so you can go away remembering that instead of the main dishes. They should be charging half of what they do for that poor excuse of a buffet, there are more choices at a sizzler.",1
"Excellent beef Wellington. They have a different location in summerlin that has some amazing appetizers I wish they would get in sohi. The sohi location does have a new side item which is to die for, truffled Mac n cheese. I used to go to smith wollensky on the strip just for this dish. Now the chef from wollensky is working at off the strip sohi so we should see more positive changes",2
"Happy hour! Ok so not the greatest but still good guacamole pretty good quesadilla was ok margs nothing to write home about. Jus sayi nTime for fish tacos. So I visited on Tuesday and I have to say the grilled fish and shrimp tacos are nothing to rave about, very dry chunk of fish with a little mango i think pico sauce.",1
"I love Brown Bag! As a busy professional with type 1 diabetes, I really need to look after myself and my diet. It's easy to skip lunch but Brown Bag saves my life daily. I look forward to trying the weekly specials everything is always so delicious. Very reasonable pricing, healthy options.it really is a no brainer. You won't be disappointed!",2
"WORST SUBWAY EVER. When trying to add my vegetables, the guy helping was incredibly rude and looked annoyed that he was there. And then when I asked for my sandwich wrapped in separate halves, he said nothing and huffed and puffed as he wrapped. He acted like i was ruining his day. So rude and unprofessional. I will NEVER come to this Subway again.",1
"My wife loves In Out. I've still yet to figure out what the hype is all about. I've been to at least four different locations in four different states and the quality of the meal is the same. So, you know exactly what to expect when you go to an In Out. I'm sure that's what attracts people to them but I need a lot more 'wow' factor when it comes to a good American burger and fries.",1
"Great wait staff, always friendly. Food is superb. They keep the menu small, so they can use fresh ingredients and unique items. I have not had anything here that wasn't above average. Short ribs are great. It is small, poplular and they do not take reservations. My wife and I's favorite place to eat dinner now.",2
The Ultimate feast was truly amazing. It was delicious and I basically ate the entire thing haha. My stomach is beyond full but it was worth it. My friend had the beer battered fish and chips and she said it was delicious. It looked really yummy. We had cheese sticks to start and they were pretty good as well!,2
"I was starving and just needed something quick before the bar so I wasn't drinking on an empty stomach. And even THAT didn't stop me from sending back my overly breaded, overly cooked, rock hard chicken strips and asking for a refund because I didn't even want to consider eating anything else they made. Ick. I'd rather eat at Subway, and that's saying a lot.",1
Update After speaking to someone at the Corporate office I was able to pick up a battery the next day and it is working great. I am updating to two stars due to the service and prompt attention received from Corporate. I may try another Ridenow franchise in the future but would not return to the Apache Junction location again.,1
"Perfect place if that is possible. It's a shame that it's closed. I've been to both locations New Orleans . The service and food are impecable. No other restaurant can compare to the level of detail and service. When I was in Vegas three years ago, it was voted best american restaurant on the strip. That says a lot about the level and quality.",2
"Mediocre food at best when we went last week. Don't let the Italiaame fool you. Very limited Italian menu and when I asked for grated cheese ony angel hair pasta, the waitress looked surprised, went and checked and of course they don't have any. Why would they? Lame and the wine isn't all that much of a value either. Better places abound.try anything else.",1
"My only visit, about 3 years ago, was lovely. The cinnamon raisin version of their creamy peanut butter was so amazing and the asian curry was unbelievably delicious. I would have visited again today, but they may be closed website is down and the phone number is disconnected. Hopefully I just have poor timing, otherwise it's quite a sad loss.",2
"really a great course, nice routing and solid layout. aside from the cart attendandant being really nice, the outside staff were hitting balls when we were finished without offering assistance with are clubs, not to mention, no water on the golf course to drink, its a 108 out guys, come on! people appear rather complacent here and that is not good. that includes management too!",1
"A big menu and most of the food is pretty solid. They brew their own beer on site, and my favorites are the Stone of Scone Scotch Ale and Crop Circle Wheat. This is a good place to take a big group of people and is in a cool historic building. I highly recommend eating on the patio, it's really nice.",2
"I'm a fan of Michael Jackson, like most people, but mainly for nostalgic reasons! We had tickets booked for this show on NYE for about 4 months. It was really great! We had great seats in the middle of the theatre, slightly to the left. The lighting was amazing, great choice of tunes and the performers were incredible. Well worth the money and great with a few drinks!",2
"Overpriced and horrible. Was hankering for a Crepe Suzette so I stopped by Paris Crepe on Rue St. Catherine for one. What appeared before me, however, was not Crepe Suzette. It was this thick, doughy buckwheat crepe that had orange marmalade smeared on top plus a small dusting of confectioners' sugar. Really? That for 11 tip?",1
"My wife tool me to this place for birthday 11 years ago. First of all, you have to dress up Nd make well advance reservation to eat here. I was too excited a out the food but they pamper you a lot. So, if you want to enjoy the food and want to eat a good portion, not sure whether this is the place. This place is designed for different kind of people.",2
"Review based on wine appetizer never had a full meal . They had great service with a good range of wines, many of which were not available at other merchants. Having a decent selection to choose from by the glass was also a plus. Unfortunately with the discount wine places opening up in the West valley, this place couldn't make it.",2
"My friends and I went through guest list where we were supposed to get there by 11pm. The line was super long, but we all ended up getting in okay. Loved the lights! and Bassjackers definitely were awesome live! This night was super crowded like the other new clubs in Vegas. My friends and I mostly hung out upstairs. The entertainment was great. Can't wait to come again.",2
Arrived around 500 530pm and just beat the crowd. Our party of 7 was first in line. The place is a bit snug but you'll soon forget once you're served their smoked meat. Rib eye was pretty tasty and im a fan of mustard so loved the concoction with bread. I didn't get to try their drink but heard nothing but good comments on it.,2
Yogurt soju and bulgogi fries with a spicy kochujang sauce and KPOP videos playing on the big screens. What's there not to like? I'm going to have to come back to try the other flavored soju drinks and sample the other Korean dishes. They also have five karaoke rooms which I will have to try as well. Good service for an Asian place and good for group drinking.,2
"Not the Farmhouse replacement.I haven't even been, but I am going to say ""it doesn't compare "". We had to wait a long time, we couldn't sit outside because there weren't enough sun shades umbrellas, food was average for breakfast, the spicy bloody mary was good. People were nice enough but its a bar atmosphere at the end of the day.",1
"This place has something for everyone. I ordered the Pick 3 option a slice of pizza, salad, and half a sandwich. nAll for 8. The meal was very good and I will be back. I have to admit I expected less from this place, but I was proved wrong. It's not your ordinary pizza joint. Very good food! Pizza was thin and delicious.",2
"It took this restaurant a few months to get their act together and I'm happy to say I think they have. The food has always been good nothing fancy, but always full of flavor. Breakfast is really nice I enjoy their biscuits and gravy. They have some pretty awesome salads and sandwiches too. NW Peoria is finally starting to develop.",2
"Located at circus circus. Don't go unless there is a discount such as the 3 for 57 they r currently running. For 57, one can go see the reef at Mandalay bay, the secret garden at mirage, and this place. This place is real stingy when it comes to money. They don't honor coupon or any deals unless printed on paper. Coupons on phone is useless.",1
super big store which i love! Employees are so nice and always ask if you need a bra measured or need help! dressing rooms are big. semi annul sale is awesome here. is farther from my house but thats not too big of a deal since i dont just go to scottsdale fashion square just for this store! is pricey thought which is sad because if it were somewhat cheaper i would shop here a lot more often!,2
"Great selection and always made to order. I like both of those! Pita Pit is one of those places I always forget about while making my lunch decision when I'm at work and for that, shame on me. It's very clean always, the service is super fast paced and they get you turned around and back on your way io time. Get here early though, it gets slammed!",2
"I don't understand the hype. Is it because it's in the same plaza as a gelato joint and zen 32? Oooh, and sweet potato fries served in a cutesy mini shopping cart?.no thanks. The burger was just so so, but nothing I wanted to even continue eating after the first bite. On the plus side, better than IHOP or Denny's for a late night, after the bar meal.",1
"Letttuce wrap, and hot and sour soup was good. My Vietnamese crab salad was neither Vietnamese nor a salad. It was cold stale noodles with hardly noticable crab, spinkles of fruit and no sauce, yet it was almost the highest priced lunch item. A restaurant with real vietnamese food wouldn't be caught dead serving such fakery. Please take it off the menu. Worse than cafeteria food.",1
"An unexpected turn led us towards The Devils Advocate. I'm glad it did. A great location and venue. The food was fantastic. Especially the Haggis bonbons that everyone has mentioned. The staff were all very good. Quite attentive and helpful. Especially the super cute redhead waitress from Winnipeg of all places. Go here, you won't be disappointed.",2
Mario the store manager is one of the best employees autozone has. I travel for my job so I pass a lot of autozones and have sampled most in the valley and for that matter auto part stores in general. Mario has never not been able to help and always has a happy and cheerful attitude. I have all vintage cars and tractors and he has never been stumped.,2
I simply LOVE their asparagus and fontina cheese panini! I ask them to add ham which makes it even more tasty and filling. I tried it with chicken once and didn't enjoy it as much. I usually eat a half and take the other half home for another meal unless I'm really hungry. I also love the mini cupcakes that cost only 50 cents. Such a deal and the red velvet ones are my favorite! Yummy!,2
"Nothing special, IMO. I visited to experience something new, as this restaurant does not exist in NC or TN. The burger reminded me of something I would get from Steak n' Shake. The burger was ok, not bad or the best tasting burger. nThe fries were fresh and not too salty, they tasted like potato chips. nThe restaurant was busy, but the service was prompt. This was worth trying once.",1
Dined here with my husbdand while spending a few days in las vegas. The meals were actually pretty good but not worth the insane prices at all. If the prices were more reasonable I'd give a better rating but I've had much better for much less. Overated! Have dinner at zeffrinos in the venetian instead . now thats a restauranyt where you'll get your moeny's worth!,1
"Great new addition to downtown Phoenix! We have stopped in a few times already and have been very impressed with everything we tried. They offer an extensive and reasonably priced happy hour, so highly recommend checking it out. The edamame and potstickers are quite good and the rice bowls are tasty too.",2
"Delicious food. I work crazy hours, from 3am 1pm, so I've tried many different breakfast places in the Charlotte area. This is one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast. Biscuits are incredible, especially w their apple butter sauce. My only small gripe is their price. Expect to pay about 9 10 per plate for breakfast. But that's the cost of having fresh, non greasy food!",2
"I have had some horrible dentistry experiences so going to this office I was very concerned. However, the staff was professional and I have seen Both Dr. Tracy and Dr. Huber and they were so nice and professional that I have referred several family and friends. There new office is quite far from me but I would drive across town to go their office!",2
"Service was great. But the food was so disappointing. I ordered Chicken Piccata and it was pretty bad. The chicken was flattened and slightly saut u00e9ed. But it was not good, almost rubbery. Then on the side there was a small portion of linguine with marinara and green beans. Both were so underwhelming. I expected much more, especially for a 26 plate.",1
"The team at Creative Moving is AMAZING! They made the stress of moving less hectic. They are professional, courteous and cared about my needs. They were on time and worked efficiently! I will only use Creative Moving and will continue to recommend them to family, friends and clients! Thanks for being AWESOME Creative Moving!",2
"Even though I've moved from Dilworth to Cotswold, I still bring my dog, Maeby, to K 9 a few times per month because she loves it so much. The staff know her by name and she always comes home completely exhausted. My only complaint is I wish they had grass for dogs to use the restroom on, but I am glad it is an indoor outdoor facility!",2
"We had a reservation tonight for 2 at 6 00. Arriived at 5 55 and were told it would be 10 minutes until we were seated. We finally were seated at 7 30, after watching a couple without a reservation being seated before us, as well as several larger parties wh arrived after us being seated before us. The manager did finally take 15 percent off, but still, don't over book your reservations.",1
"I Love Oasis Bagels. Most importantly they have great bagels. unlike anything else you will find. Good omlettes, and the chicken sandwich for lunch is my favorite. I have been many times and find the quality to be always good. A great part of the community and neighborhood. Friendly people and a great meeting place.",2
"This is the type of place you want to keep coming back and trying other ""Pasties "" this has only been the second time I've been but will go back the first time I had the ""Cajun Chicken "" it was great this time I had the ""Rosemary Chicken "" and it was just ok not enough flavor and a little dry but it still was good and it didn't turn me of from this place at all. I will be back soon",2
"la comida fantastica,de los muchos restaurantes cubanos que he visitado, este es el mejor,y creo que pueden seguir creciendo si se lo proponen. n u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1felicidadez u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1 u00a1",2
"had a very nice experience at this place. The waiter was very attentive! there were 13 of us , 5 children under age 8 years and 8 adults. although i am the only one who ordered the fish, it was good! they teased me because they told me that i should have ordered steak because it is a steak house! i didnt care.i am a seafood person.",2
"XS is the best club in America. Hands down. You shouldnt be contemplating coming here, you should just come. Nothing more needs to be said. They spent something like 100 million dollars to make this nightclub. It speaks for itself. If you dont like XS you probably just dont like clubbing in general.",2
"So the last couple times I have eaten at Joe's within the last 6 months or so I have been sorely dissapointed. It used to be my husband's and I's favorite pizza spot around and we went there all the time. They must have changed ingredients or lowered the quality of them, as their pizza is just not as good as it used to be. Just regular old mediocre pizza now.",1
"My wife and daughter like the cheesesteaks, so I wish I liked the sandwiches. Bottom line, the hoagie rolls are stale and gross here, so a cold turkey sandwich is destined for mediocrity. I guess on the positive side it keeps me from eating bread, but to me that's one of the key components of a sandwich done right. Genos doesn't get it right.",1
"One star is waaaay to high for this place. Lies, lies, and more lies. Plan on spending half the day, not 90 minutes. Oh and oops they ran out of the show tickets you were promised. Plus the place is a dump and they are looking for suckers to pay 69,000 for a one week a year time share so they can use your money to fix it up. You will leave angry, guaranteed!",1
"I heard around that this place was better than the infamous ""Pacific Buffet "" which I don't even like by the way . I was up and ready to try it, as I walked around the food islands. I wanted to leave. Food was dried up, sushi was not fresh. We didn't leave because we've already drove so far for this place. I did not like anything but the fried rice I customized myself.",1
"Sexy restaurant nestled in the cosmopolitan hotel over looking the Bellagio fountains. Sophisticated flavors and thoughtful presentation.loved the Pici, Classic Spaghetti, Short Ribs, and Heirloom Tomatoes.the bread basket and accoutrements are to die for.most of all.thank you Jonathan for your impeccable service!",2
"Slow checkout lines and inadequate staffing for checkout. They're also very slow to call for extra checkout help. Really, the line shouldn't be that long before someone is called to help. They get away with this it seems because there are so few grocery store choices in this area. Location, location, location is as true as ever.",1
"After visiting my new grandson my wife and I decided to stop in Chipolte for a meal. Since I am a vegetarian I thought I'd have to get the usual of all non meat products, I.e. Beans, rice, chips, salsa. I was pleasantly surprised that they had a product called sofrita which is a tofu based product. I had this in a burrito with rice beans and guacamole. It was tasty and filling meal.",2
HM not quite sure if i went on a bad day.but my chicken was SOOOOOO salty and therefore the poutine i ordered was salty as well because they put the same chicken on top. I couldnt finish it. The only thing i would give 5 stars to is their egg custard pies.they were DELICIOUS! i went back later that day just for another.,1
"I will never ever recommend this hotel to anyone I value. I thought the room was spacious enough but my husband woke up with several bites on his body from some type of bug. That is a deal breaker! And to top it off we made a complaint, someone came out to ""investigate "" and nothing was ever done. Absolutely no compensation.",1
"My daughter moved to the Southwest side of town and needed a vet close by. She found Dr. Roach and was so impressed with him and his staff that I thought I would give them a try as well. Dr. Roach takes his time with everyone and explains in detail what you will expect. The offices are new, clean and they have reasonable prices. I feel that they truly care about my dog.",2
"Always have a delicious experience at BC. I was there last week, had the table side guac, fish tacos and some sangria. Loved everything. My boyfriend knocked over his entire glass of sangria and our server promptly cleaned up the table, changed the linens and brought out a new drink. Great service, charming atmosphere, amazing food and drinks.",2
I'll say this club is very fancy. Nice bathrooms everything looks great. But I paid 9 for a bud light draft that is kinda said ended up leaving after one hour was not all impressed by the girls two on a stage at a time. No draft beer. Go somewhere else unless you're wanting to spend your whole paycheck.,1
"I wasn't impressed at all. The servers are helpful. But the freshly squeezed juices are horrible. If your going to charge me 4 it better taste freshly squeezed, hand picked, and good. As far as the crepes I wasn't too impressed. The omelets were dry. Plus the food was pricey. I don't mind paying more for good food but this place just doesn't cut it.",1
"Photography is not work but an art, and Traci has mastered the art of capturing life's precious moments in photos. She has done pictures of my family including my newborn baby and tiny little 4 legged baby which were great. She is brings warmth, positivity, and a creative eye to each shoot which results in amazing pictures",2
"Everything was pretty good and the menu had a few different takes on Mexican food that I've never seen before. They serve a sweet salsa and a regular, but the food is still pretty good! The sopapillas were pretty damn good for desert! Margaritas were great too! It was not like a regular chain so I would definitely recommend it if you're in the area!",2
"The staff was wonderful with my 20 reservation! I had talked w the manger a few different times and she was great! We were immediately seated and our servers were great, too! The food was amazing every person in our party commented on what a great time they had! We will definitely be going back next time in Vegas! Thank you, Catherine for all of your help!",2
"Nice looking place, but my last stay was an abomination. They up sold me a suite, when all I wanted was a regular room. They said there were not available. I later found out that they lied. The front desk was rude. nI had to wait 3 hours to check in. The waits for the restaurant were long and the pool bar was empty because the bartenders were ignorant and betting on football games.",1
I'm sure that other theaters could provide a better viewing experience picture and sound were not perfect but the overall experience was just fine. I am a fan of 2nd run theaters and this one is probably the best I've been to just because of the ticket price alone 1.50 for general admission. Can't beat it.,2
" u00a32.60 for a Panini.in Edinburgh? nWhen i found out I almost bought the flat above the shop. This place is amazing, it's the most Glaswegian shop in Edinburgh. Good, honest, rough as fuck meals that will fill your stomach for less than a fiver. Avoid mornings at all costs because it's packed out the door.",2
"The posted price for the rooms are not the actual price, The hotel charges a Resort fees that is 16.95. When adding up the total fees, the price can be a much as The Holiday Inn. I would bet that the people are a better class. I've never ragged on peoplew but the class at the station was horentious.",1
"I am giving this restaurant two stars only because my meal was delicious. The service was lousy. Our waitress never smiled, she failed to refill water, soda, wine. She did not ask how the meal was. We asked for a box which she forgot and when we said never mind about the box after ten minutes or so she did not even comment. I left a tiny tip which she barely deserved. Horrible service.",1
"Ladies and gents, I present to you The Sci Fi Center, brought to you by the legend himself, the one and only William Powell! Will it be a 70s neo noir german sexploitation sci fi double feature, or an acoustic silent burlesque in the dark? There's only one way to find out! Also comic books and a better location.",2
"Great super fresh food and feels very hometown ish. that's good. nThe food rocks and there's ample indoor and outdoor seating. Food Network's ""Diners, Drive ins, and Dives "" with host Guy Fieri filmed a segment there which probably helped with some popularity but their food is great so it's no wonder they're already famous. See you there.",2
"I would recommend reading the reviews of the other locations and see how people are promised one thing when they sign up only to have it change when it is time to renew their contract. Prices going up over 180 a year after being told their ""price for life "" to being nickel and dimed to use separate pieces of equipment. Do research!",1
"Not a lot to say here. Nice Starbucks. Large, clean, kept to a comfortable temperature, like most Starbucks. The staff seem attentive and stuff, like most Starbucks. Bathrooms are clean, like Starbucks. Music is quiet and backgroundy, like most Starbucks. Internet works well, like most Starbucks. Nothing too original or unique, like most Starbucks.",2
"Love this place! My aunt and uncle introduced my family and I to this spot while vacationing in Vegas a while back and this by far is one of the best restaurants ever! The customer service is great, the food is fantastic, and the price isn't bad either! I recommend it to anyone looking to try something new or just simply experience fusion dining.",2
"Wonderful experience. Nice little sushi house. The fish was fresh and the rolls were rolled nicely and balanced in flavor. Our server short with curly hair was very knowledgable and kind. I checked in with yelp and whereas it says that you receive a free appetizer with a check in, that's incorrect. You get a gross sweet little cocktail type drink. I was kinda annoyed by that.",2
"Amaaazing pizza! Some of the best in town, and probably my favorite thin crust. I think it's better here than at Jupiter's 2 for some reason. Unlike some of the bars downtown, this one also usually has a drink special every night. I also love the pool hall setup. Overall one of my fav bars in Champaign.",2
I went to and I have to say first impressions where not that good the decor was somewhere between chic and tacky. However when I got my Ribeye I really liked it. For dessert I had the Greek doughnuts and I have no complaints about them. However it was very pricey. If you do go their get the flaming cheese! It is amazing I love it when they set it on fire and say Opa.,2
Great place to take out of towners to for a good pizza. You really can't go wrong with any pizzas on the menu. If you are a craft beer fan you will love their happy hour half off drinks . Best place on mill if you are looking to drink good beer and just hang out with a small group of friends. Patio is perfect for watching all the drunk frat boy monkeys and their skeezy girls act like idiots.,2
"I used to go to Mi Amigo every time I was in Casa Grande on my trips, and it was always good. I had not been there lately. Yesterday, I went with my family and it was a big disappointment. You get red sauce with nchips no salsa. The cheese crisp came cold. The taco,enchilada, ntamale,flauta was sub par. Very disappointed.",1
"Belle petite place. Client u00e8le tr u00e8s anglophone. La bouffe est super bonne tr u00e8s inventive et diff u00e9rente. Savoureuse aussi mais pas tr u00e8s abordable. 160 pour 2 entr u00e9es, 2 plats principaux vraiment grosses portions et une bouteille de vin. Je recommande de ne pas prendre d'entr u00e9e pour calmer l'addition.",2
"Disappointing, especially when compared to SLS in Miami or Los Angeles. Las Vegas hotel did not meet my expectations. I expected the decor to be unique, but it just freely ""thrown together "" especially Cosmopolitan or Encore are other options. Maybe they're still trying to get the bugs out since it's fairly new.",1
"Always great deals here. Can be hard to find your size if you are common but it's worth a stop when in Vegas. The running shorts are very high quality and when they do a sale on clearance prices, can go for 12 each. I have a bunch now. The service is helpful and friendly, which is exceptional given how busy it is in there.",2
"Ordered online from grubhub. The food was fine, but the Thai ice tea tasted funky. The delivery service was horrible. The driver took a long time to find our house, and then forgot to give us the Thai ice tea. We had to call the restaurant for the driver to come back and redeliver our drinks. Would much rather go in person than order delivery.",1
"I love this place. It's not as cheap as Panda Express, but that's the point. If you want a good, fast Chinese food experience, eat here. If you want to get some Starbucks before or after, this is a good place too. If you're lonely, write more yelp reviews. Please take some time out of your day to try some Chinese that's not poured out of a semi truck shipped from California if not further .",2
Came here to check out the new bachi breakfast and health spot. Got here around 10 30 so we made if before the lunch rush. Very good brunch spot. They also serve burgers we are familiar with from the Vegas gem Bachi Burger. Prices are good and standard. Service was on point. I can honestly say I have nothing negative about this place. Will be returning,2
Clean and well maintained. nFriendly staff. I got eyebrow wax very quick and painless nupper lip wax I got my first ever mani pedi with custom natural nail design. n Bunnies blingy flowers 33 35 bucks nI was scared but the ladies made me feel comfy. They did a great job and put detail and effort into their works of art. Would recommend to a friend.,2
Dr Khorsandi is the best! He fixed all my issues with my first breast augmentation from a different doctor and now my boobs are PERFECT and 10x better then my first. My fianc u00e9 told me that there's no comparison on how much better they are now. He also did my rhinoplasty and I couldn't be happier! He took the time and really listened to me and gave me everything I asked for.,2
"Way too expensive for such a little amount. I have had much better tasting Acai bowls before and with half the price. Go to Thrive! Wont be flexible by substituting strawberries instead of bananas for the topping either. It's an extra 50 cents for that! Dumb. Also, horrible customer service! I hate to be rude, but don't waste your time or money here.",1
"Neighborhood bar with AMAZING food. Don't go to the ""other "" fake freash seafood places. This one is the real deal. Never had a bad meal here. The drinks are always perfect. Try the appletini. We even go here for breakfast since Vegas has a hard time figuring out a place for breakfast that stays consistant. You won't be sorry. We love this bar.",2
"Someone had recommended this place to me but unfortunately I did not like one thing we had ordered, in fact everything we had was pretty awful. How can you mess up this type of food if that's what you specialize in? Tasted like one of those low budget Chinese Vietnamese buffets to me. Will not be going back.",1
"Great food as expected by the amazing Giada. The service however was terrible! I won't go back for this reason. The waiter forgot half of our order, hit me with a serving tray, forgot drinks and even over charged us for two cocktails that never came to the table. There is a definite management issue so far with the restaurant.",1
Stopped in while waiting for a flight. Should have bypassed it altogether. That is time wasted that I will never get back. I walked out after standing at the counter without any acknowledgment from multiple employees. I apologize to any visitors to Vegas who have had to endure this establishment. This is not a good representation of our city. I will never visit them again.,1
"Wanting to avoid my hotel's 'free breakfast', I made a short trip to D'lish and am very glad I did. Enjoyed a vegie frittata and coffee. Service was very friendly and quick. I'd estimate seating for 20 indoor w a patio out front. nThe coffee was very good and a nice alternative to the chains. I will definitely make it a regular stop when I'm back in Phoenix.",2
"Arrived at the restaurant, and was waiting at the counter to be seated. Some people came in behind me, and the hostess totally looked past me and seated those people before me. How Rude! Needless to say they lost my business very unprofessional. But thanks to them I found a great new sushi place right down street, Called Sushi 21 people were very friendly and the food was great!",1
Checked out the reviews on yelp so decided to give this spot a try since I live close by. Drove into an empty parking lot. That was a bad sign but decided to give it a try anyway. The restaurant was dark and the service was ok. I ordered camarones rancheros. The shrimp was overcooked. Rice and beans were ok. Overall not impressed. Wont be coming back.,1
"Cargo Coffee is a most excellent place to while away an afternoon working or hanging out with friends or reading or whatever your heart desires. It's big and open and spacious. The people working there are friendly. They have a great selection of drinks and an okay selection of snacks. Free Wi Fi. Ample parking. And if you are in a hurry they also have a drive thru, which is pretty top dollar.",2
"Olive Garden has decent food.the bread sticks and salad are always a favorite. We ordered the Alfredo pizza.but when the waiter brought out the food it was the Alfredo pasta, easy mix up. However, the manager came over and apologize for the confusion and offered a free appetizer, which was nice. Overall, the food was good and the service was pleasant.",2
"Didn't end up buying the tree. Really wanted to because it seems like a family run business and I think we actually met Tim, who seemed very nice. However, the rest of the staff could not be bothered. I asked 4 different people the price of an item and no one could answered. The trees seemed overpriced as well. Going to check out another lot.",1
"I have stayed at this property a couple times and have never had a problem. I won't give it a 5 star, only because of the surrounding area can be a little rough . The rooms are large, the staff members are pleasant and the breakfast is actually good. Plenty of free parking, which can be an issue in this area. If you are going to this area, stay here you will enjoy it.",2
"Really disappointed with the Roast Beef panini daily special. I got home and it's a mess of a sandwich. Dry meat, soggy bread and where's the horseradish sauce? Even the pickle was sad. nI had this here before and it was fine. What happened? nSorry to say, I may have to boycott the Vig Deli. Not the first time I've had a bad experience. Gonna be asking for a refund. nMeh.",1
"Upon entering, the place was empty. Should have been a clue. I was allowed to taste the chicken, and it was good. However, upon placing my order, I was disgusted. I watched as the lady called it back to the cook, who was putting food in his own mouth before licking his fingers. I IMMEDIATELY canceled my order and left. Such a shame that they're so nasty, because the food is good.",1
"Great airport. I will do my connection through this airport if I have a cost effective option to do so, and i don't mind doing longer layovers here. Clean airport, attendants in bathrooms, good selection of food establishments, decent prices, sufficient places to sit, with seating also near outlets to charge your devices.",2
"Sitting here in phoenix again, pilots and crew are pretending to do their jobs. A screw was loose on our original plane and we're close to the hour when we won't be able to take off tonight. Us air is trying to make it look like they're trying to get another plane ready. They're not even the pilot is standing in the gate area. Liars",1
"Always have good selection of high quality food, friendly service, awesome cheesecake. Best place on earth to eat cheesecake, only problem is deciding which one to have out of 50 flavors. They have even gone the extra mile to cater to my vegan friends and if a problem arises they definitely try to make things right. Conveniently at the Chandler Fashion Center. ",2
"Very disappointed with this store located in Boca Park. Service was terrible. I am posting a picture of the sandwich we ordered. Pretty much bare with very little on it. Server didn't bring all our order, had to go back and deal with the line. The light fixture above us was filthy and had dead bugs in it",1
"Club Only Review nTips for girls n1. Get in touch with a promoter. n2. Come EARLY, the line gets ridiculously long. n3. Free drinks til 11 if your group is cute enough they'll let you sit at a table until its bought! Tao can get super crowded, but one of the better clubs in vegas! And whenever I go, there's a good mixed crowd!",2
"My friend and I went to the show. We love 40's and 50's inspired music and clothing. Well, it was not what we expected. Yes, it is Clair Sinclair so there is going to be a lot of T A, but it really isn't a good show. The soloist is good, but we wouldn't recommend this show. With all due respect, Claire is not an entertainer.",1
"Hotel is below par. I like the fact that the tables are cheap during the day, so I hit this in the AM for a few hours. The restaurants and bars inside could use an upgrade. I have never stayed here, but a lot of my friends have.blech! They have told me that the rooms are really run down. Stay at the Wynn or Venetian. You will be happier.",1
"I had heard good things about the Good Feet system but it did not work for me. I tried it for a month and the plantar fasciitis pain still persisted. After I quit using it my foot has gradually gotten better. I have no idea why two insoles would be so ridiculously expensive! Also, the man that sold to me said he would call back again in two or three weeks. Never did. Quite disappointed!",1
"Only went for the food and lions. Sorry, MGM, the Rainforest Cafe has sucky food and your lion exhibit is a bit sad. Not much room for those lions. Wish the big cats had more room. They looked decently cared for, other than that. I'm sure sometimes there are stupid people pounding on the glass to try to get their attention, but not while we were there.",1
"I have been here a couple of times for Lunch. At first I had no idea why my friends were telling me to pack the meat so tightly into the bowl. I soon found out when we got to the huge scorching hott metal ""grill? wok? "" whatever it is my food came out delicious. The portions you get for 7 or 8 bucks are colossal! I'm talking Lunch, Dinner and a late night snack.MMMM good",2
"They deliver, what more can you want? nThey're solid classic Chinese food. I've tried the Tso's, Mongolian beef, beef lo mein, and egg drop soup. All exactly what I expected, exactly what I wanted. nBe forewarned I tried a 4 5 pepper spiciness dish from the traditional menu chengdu I believe . It was 60 hot peppers, 40 chicken, and nothing else. Blew my socks off and I can handle spicy.",2
"I must say with the amount of business this Burger King does it has always been accurate, fast and declicious. They have the best chicken sandwich The Original in town. I would have given 5 stars but, the trash can in the drive thru when you are exiting is always full and overflowing. Who wants to drive over trash? Not me.",2
"Good pad Thai gai, large portions. They used dark chicken, which my boyfriend liked, but I would've preferred white chicken. Also tried the spring rolls which were good, not too greasy. It's located in a food court with other Asian restaurants which were mostly closed when we got there at 8 30pm. There's a Dollarama next door which is convenient.",2
.I can't say enough good things about Revolution Fitness.this place has more variety of people attending than probably any gym on earth.and because of that EVERYONE feels comfortable.I took a friend recenty who is not a gym person and she said feels like one big family.if you are from out of town stop in and see how a gym should be.perfection.,2
Nice setting but they mess up my order EVERY single time. I drive an extra 5 miles to the other Dunkin Donuts that has a much better staff. Avoid this Dunkin at all costs. If they don't get your order wrong you can assure yourself try will be out of something! Probably will be a Jimmy Johns or Chipotle within 6 months,1
War heute das erste mal dort und es war ein sehr netter Abend. n Der Raum ist recht gro u00df und hellh u00f6rig und so ist es von Vorteil in einer Gruppe zu kommen. F u00fcr den Abend zu zweit ist das Lokal dann doch meiner Ansicht nach ein wenig zu laut. n Der Service ist top und sehr aufmerksam. Das Essen war sehr lecker. n Alles in allem zu empfehlen.,2
Portions HUGE! Rough night. Waiting 30 min for a table. No biggie it's Friday night. But our server could not handle the rush. Waited 10 min not an exaggerated time for drinks then placed our order! My food had a hair in it it happens but my friend son got presented a meal he did not even order and we're hoping in a few months things settle in and service and everything is more smooth and better!,1
"Lo, and let it be said that this church offers a path a path to righteous salvation, and those who do not heed the word of the Lord shall suffer torment and damnation. Forsooth, let not the beads and revelry fool you for this edifice is indeed a path to another dimension. Please no dancing, spitting or cursing. And tip the bartender. He's my dad.",2
"It was great.I was a bit reluctant to go here as I had eaten at a Brazilian steakhouse in Vegas many years ago which was just an assembly line.meat was dry and tasteless. I was told this is different.it was meats were flavorful and moist.very good. They have a large salad bar which was a bit different, but again good.",2
Not bad on a non football Sunday. Got right in to break in my pistol. Disappointed they require you to buy 50 rds of their ammo when had already brought my own box of 100. Gets pricey that way. Never the less I fired all 150 rds and I had a good time. Convenient and close to the I 15 on the south side so definitely might return.,2
"This place is ok for a burger joint. The milkshakes is where it's at, but the burger itself was not to impressive. I was in Vegas and I heard that this place had some good burgers. For the price of the burger, I expected better. nIf by chance you're in San Diego and you want a good burger, stop by a place called Boomerrang's Gourmet Burger",1
"I paid 419 for an oil change and detail. They told me they could finish in less than 2 hours. Went back at noon and they told me they aren't done. Finally at 4 30 I returned and they did nothing more than a VIP wash and were full of excuses. I did get partial refund, but that was only after fighting with 4 different people",1
"I've been going to Elliot for about two years now today I tried a new shop because I moved across town.the good news is I have an appointment next week for him to fix it. My haircut is pretty simple, but he simply does a great job. I now have a reminder of why I haven't been anywhere else in a long time fortunately, it will be erased next week.",2
"Wow this place is over hyped! Should have gone to max brenner! 12 for a mediocre chocolate shake! Honestly, it was nothing special at all! The only thing that was good was the Sundae with a chocolate cake in it. nAlso the software they use to seat you is nice. And the wait was shorter than what they had said.",1
Broke a nail on the plane as usual and used yelp to find this shop. Walked in and it was empty. No one waiting and I told the last I needed a nail fixed would have taken maybe 10 mins at most . Was them told they don't have anyone to helps. They are all booked for the night. It's 4pm. I find it hard to believe they were booked. Oh well on to the next,1
"Pathetic car wash. If you want good service, value for your money go to another car wash. They left patches of dirt on the tires, body and on the bumper. Even after complaining to the so called ""Manager "", nothing happened. I paid for the VIP car wash. Left disappointed. Will never go back. Stay away from this car wash.",1
"Came here with a friend to get a mani pedi done we didn't have an appointment, but when a walked in they told us very rudely that they didn't have time for both of us, only one. They didn't even ask what we were there for. They had maybe 3 people in the shop on a Sunday. Needless to say not recommending this shop. Never will be going back.",1
"All I have to say is Pork Adobo Fried Rice! Just this alone makes me want to drive 5 hours from Phoenix, to eat this and this alone. I love Hawaiian food for its perfect fusion of Asian cuisines but this has to be the best fusion of all in the history of fusions. Good thing they have 3 locations in Vegas so I can hit one on my way in and while by the strip and on my way home.",2
Come to relax. nCome to enjoy a cool place that gives off a nice vibe. nCome to enjoy some wine. nCome to have some cheese and meat plates with you drinks. nCome to get some good friendly and knowledgable service nSit at some tables in the back and enjoy your company or sit at the bar and get to meet some really friendly people.,2
Review of Casino only.The floor staff is unprofessional and asleep at the wheel. A craps dealer literally stole 7 from me ao one cared other than the security guard. Even the surveillance team made up a fantastic story to defend the inept dealer and pit boss. Spray yourself with Lysol before entering and exiting.,1
"Joe's is the perfect place to go on a hot summer day. When we walked in, we were greeted immediately by a free sample of pineapple ice that was soooo good. I ended up getting Strawberries and cream and my mom got Tiger's Blood a mix of strawberry, watermelon and coconut. They were both great tasting flavors. The service was awesome and they were willing to let us taste anything we wanted.",2
"Being from the Northeastern tri state, I must admit that I'm extremely particularly about my haircut. I gave H Cut Above a try and he did not disappoint. He took his time with my haircut and checked periodically to make sure things were progressing to my liking. I got a tapered cut with razor edge up and shave. I recommend checking him out.",2
This was my first visit here today and I ordered the spinach pie and small hummus. It was really good. My friend L got the gyros salad and it looked so good she said it was. My other friend T ordered the veggie lasagna and it looked so good! She ate every bite. I didn't feel the portions were to small I thought they were perfect!,2
"Review is for the beer. Stopped in during happy hour waiting for my flight and decided to go with a sampler set. Six cups, six ounces each for 15. Generous amount and great hoppy beers. Friendly staff and the food does look tasty. Nice looking tap room and ambience. A must stop if you're by Madison.",2
"Small shop located on St. Denis in the Plateau. The reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the stuff are very indifferent and not that helpful. If this were a self srve it would amount to about the same thing. If I'm going to pay big money on yoga clothes, I expect a high level of service to go with it.",1
"we got comped 4th row tickets and we were thrilled to watch it. from the very moment rafiki gets on stage and starts the first song, i was mesmerized. it was simply stunning. i've watched o and ka and the night before we watched the blue man group and none of them can even compare to the lion king. loved it.",2
"Not for large groups. We didn't get half of our drinks. Asked several times. We asked several times for silverware. We ended up getting it ourselves. Our food order was all wrong. Half of our group didn't get what they ordered. Good for those who got theirs right. Women's restroom had no toilet paper and no paper towels. While some in my group may go back, I will not.",1
"Not worth the price in my opinion. The food was mediocre, portions were sparse, service was practically nonexistent on a slow day i.e. no excuse for being ignored . I work in Uptown and love smell coming from Rooster's. I decided to try it out and I was not at all impressed. I might be prompted to try it again. Hopefully I'll be inclined to change this review on a better day.",1
"Service department took me on a Saturday morning, even though I didn't have an appointment. Took care of my care problems and got me out by lunchtime. While waiting, got free coffee, donuts, and internet use. Much nicer than any other Toyota dealership I've ever been to either in Las Vegas or Los Angeles. had the parts I needed for the repairs. Price was also very reasonable.",2
"Was craving cake so stopped in at the Cupcakery. Ordered 3 different cupcakes and all three were dry and the outer edges were tough. Whether they dried out because they sit out too long, are over baked, or both, it felt like I was eating a muffin rather than cupcake. While some might say these are more ""bread like "" cupcakes, cupcakes should not be tough even if more bread like.",1
"I have been to a few of their locations and loved each one! nThe service is always exceptional, very nice and will fill any last minute order you need. nThe cake is ALWAYS super fresh, moist, perfect. nI have tried most flavors by now, they are ALL good, I am partial to anything frosted in cream cheese. nPrices are fair, a great change from cupcakes, perfect for a party!",2
"Sure do love some Honey Bears! Cheap tasty eats for us carnivores. Luckily for me, this location is 5 minutes from my work making it one of my favorite lunch break spots. I would give it an extra star if it had the cool ambience of the Van Buren location but alas, it feels like a 1980's fast food joint.",2
"It took us 40 plus minutes from Planet Hollywood to the Sahara at rush hour. I really think the driver had been pithed at a state institution and then loosed on the public as some sort of morbid joke or cynical statement about limited mental healthcare funding in Nevada. Either that or endstage snakebite. May be better at other times but I wouldn't give you odds, even in Vegas.",1
"NOT REAL MEXICAN FOOD! I wouldve to say that their food here is not real authentic, their services here is horrible! Took me 20 mins just to get the bartenders attention to order my food to go and to top it off it wasnt even busy! Being a restaurant on the strip and in the miracle mile I would really think their service would be top notch.",1
"These guys are the pros, pros! They continuously go above and beyond their scope of work to make us happy! They are true and just in all of their business dealings and I personally recommend them for ur car or trucks brake needs. They really know what they are talking about and put the customer first.",2
"I know. It's Del Taco. But it was so good. I'm tired, hungover and not in the mood to sit in a restaurant and be around people today. Our drive through order was perfect and error free. They gave us lots of napkins and a mountain of Del Scorcho sauce. Food was hot, fresh and just what we expected. Now I caap with a full and happy tummy.",2
"What i do love about the Rio, the little extra room making it a suite room is huge on my psychological happiness. everyone can say that the down point is that it's not on the strip, but to me it's next to sonics so that competely makes up for it. n The other thing is if you're a partier the palms hotel is across the street. which was nice for us since we went to he Pimp n hos costume ball.",2
"So for some reason I am really interested in bathrooms. We went for drinks here before heading out to the bachelor ette party and I had ""to go. "" I love high ceilings and I could have spent 30 minutes admiring the sinks and decor. anyways. decent drinks, beautiful hotel. coming back for a peak when I return",2
"Love this place I have known Kassy and her sister Diya since 2008 . I first came across them in the Meadows Mall and ever since then . I won't go any where else ! Best eyebrows in town I can assure you that D ! Not only are they great at what they do , but they are a family owned company and treat you with dignity !",2
"This place is great, it's right off of Mill Ave and besides having awesome chips and salsa, their tacos are huge. I only need one to fill me up but I always want more! The atmosphere is cool and I love sitting out on the patio . I get the breaded fish tacos, which is what I get at pretty much every taco joint and they are delicious!",2
"This place is great. I found this place via yelp and the reviewers were spot on. 4.5 stars. Food was great especially the bulgogi burger, blt burger, American burger, bbq wings, and parmesan fries. Owner and his mom are excellent people. Salsa and chips are warm and fresh.seriously fresh! Hope this place does well. Worth driving off the strip for.",2
This haunted house was cheaply put together and just a knock off of Rob Zombies movies. Sadly there wasn't very much originality and the tickets were overpriced for what it was. It was maybe a step up from a kiddie carnival haunted house at best. My friends and I were baffled that Rob zombie could put his name on this,1
"The best, most knowledgeable friendly wait staff thanks Eugene a genuinely involved general manager, Angelo. Sushi was as if right out of the sea. If available, try the maitake mushrooms with truffle butter. Best uni I've ever had. Beautiful restaurant with a great happy hour menu, 4 7. A more lively atmosphere than ShinBay a totally different menu.",2
"We came here because the bellboy at our hotel recommended it and they ""bought "" our first round of drinks. The girls here were alright but not that friendly and they were barely putting on a show worth watching. We stayed about 10 minutes then moved on to someplace else. It was a big waste of 30 and time.",1
"The cookies are just like homemade, only better because you don't have to bake them. Then they go crazy by taking a giant scoop of yummy ice cream and making a giant cookie ice cream sandwich. Also, cheaper than a bowl of frozen yogurt which is a big plus when you are treating the kiddies. I thought it was great.",2
"This restaurant has delicious Thai cuisine! The pricing is reasonable and food is savory. The interior of the restaurant is a little outdated and needs improvement. Hospitality was decent, but the food service is particularly slow. Overall a great place to grab a casual bite to eat. Mango sticky rice is to die for! I make sure to eat here everytime I'm in town.",2
What can I say except WOW! A client who is moving out of town and will no longer be bringing her dog to Arizona Pet Resort for Doggie Day Camp brought us pastries from Essence Bakery and Cafe. They are the best pastries any of us have ever tasted! Do yourself a favor and head over to this gem of a Cafe. You won't be sorry unless you get there so late that they are out of pastries!,2
"China Wing has the best, most authentic Korean food in Charlotte. Yes the service can be a little slow at peak times, but the food makes it all worth it. Make sure you ask for the Korean menu! It's definitely the real thing, some evenings the restaurant is packed with nothing but local Korean families. Very reasonably priced, most entrees under 10, everything under 20 even if you order a drink.",2
"Horrible! We waited in the lobby full of people for over 20 mins for a table. Normally I don't mind waiting but when I look and see servers shooting the breeze and half the restaurant empty well then it becomes an issue. Finally got a table, the food was horrible and then the bill came. What a rip off! Stay clear of this place!",1
"Good location,average food, but too expensive. Drink service is slow. Entertainment is spotty. Should double the bar size and delete dining room. this place has been steadily going down hill. surprised they are still in business. was very good 20 yrs ago. Owners watch people like hawks, desperately waiting for food orders",1
"We were back here on a Friday night in April and had a great time. A quick call to the promoter I normally use for Tryst and our group of all ladies avoided the long lines and price of admission. The music was pumping and we ended up at a VIP table with ""new friends "". P Tryst is always a good time for me. The crowd was a good mix of people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.",2
"Count on killer cocktails expertly mixed and comped if you're playing video BJ! by the most amazing bartenders in all of Vegas. Joining the consistently outstanding Kalama, Kory and Wolfgang are my new friends Sone, Deven and Sam. To all who visit them, tip them well and you will be richly rewarded in return!",2
"Can't say too much about the burgers. a bit over priced, I've def. had better burgers. The grease was, literally, dripping from the burger. The fries were tasteless, the buns were a bit stale. I'd rather go across the street to I Out, drive 7 miles to Joe's Farm Grill or even better, drive to Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe.",1
"i recently stopped by for lunch with a group from work. i'm upping the star rating to 4 for three reasons 1. the sign restricting firearms on the door. i like dining without guns. n2. service was really, really good. when 1 server can handle a table of 16 and make it look easy i'm impressed. n3. my jerk chicken salad was really, really good.",2
"Got a great shave here. However, the barber got a bunch of shaving cream on the back of my shirt and did not tell me. I was alerted by a stranger who thought I was pooped on by a bird. Should have addressed this when it happened instead of attempting to hide the mistake from me. Not very professional.",1
"The store reminds me of my German grandmother and her love for L'Air du Temps by Nina Ricci.the store seems to be frozen in time, in the 40's I would say, other than that it's all over priced stuff, not much variety, and snotty employees.I only go there because of the post office on the 4th floor.for real luxury.Nieman Marcus or KDV in Berlin.",1
Just got to vegas. Family really hungry and wanted to try good food. I was very disappointed with the service and the quality of food. Even my childreoticed the dry steak and the tasteless meatloaf. Asparagus was unseasoned as well and they charge 10 bucks for a baked potatoes and another 10 for a side of fries.,1
From my friends experience they efficient in their service for their customers. But practically for me they didn't have a nice job for me at all. So I would not like to appreciate them for their service thought they are eligible for that and many of their customers did as they expect. And these two stars only for their prompt and urgent service not for good.,1
"Typical chain location. MINIMAL customer service, tiny portions. Panda Express is getting worse as a chain. Portions are small and full of ""filler "" like diced potatoes so you get very little meat wise and YOU GET NOTHING THAT EVEN RESEMBLES THE PHOTO ADVERTISING THE PRODUCT. Too EXPENSIVE for what you get. Won't be back.",1
"I have loved the Landmark for years and hadn't been here in awhile. It's still great. We had the salad bar, which is a salad room with everything under the sun available. What I like about this restaurant is a trip to the basement where there is a fabulous collection of photos recounting Arizona's history. This is a good place for lovers of history.",2
"We love this place . We would recommend it to any one who like chinese food. We have been to most of the chinese buffets in and around Phoenix, including Crazy's in Tempe and this one is by far the best. We eat there twice a month and are on our way there now for the crab legs and oysters on half shell. Might also it is very reasonable in price.",2
Had a groupon for this place or else I wouldn't have known about it. It is a healthy alternative with all the grilled meats but it will set you back a little more than your average fast food joint. I recommend adding a salad with pomegranate dressing to any of the kabobs. The place is not much to look at but the food is tasty.,2
"Fast, friendly and the carpet looks great! This was for a rental property that we own in Phoenix that the tenants had left with stains, gum and ink marks. Kamil was there on time and was done very quickly. I would use him again. nIf you need housecleaning services, his girlfriend did an amazing job, too.",2
Highway robbery! Goodness this place is expensive! I'm used to plenty of grocery store options in Downtown Chicago and prices not much different away from Downtown. What's up with this place? I had to walk here to buy an array of fruits for an office I was contracting at. Almost 3 per apple! Not even organic. That's just bad business.,1
"I've heard good food and decent location service reminds me of visiting Germany. Mean, direct and no interest in having you there. Bartender manager needs to go back to Berlin. Totally happy to visit and within 5 minutes I was asking what I did to offend? We have amazing Scotttsdale bars and hangouts this is NOT one of them.",1
"I am all about being ""Authentic "" as I am born and raised in Chicago, and also the Founder of Chicagoans In the Desert, LLC. ""Authentic "" is the only way we roll! These beef's are it! Just like back home. Whether you get yours wet or dipped.you'll feel like your home. And of course they carry all the other fun ""Chicago "" beef stand stuff like Jays chips, Green Rivers and Wunderbars.",2
THIS PLACE SUCKS! A sports bar? REALLY?! I walk in there in the middle of the 4th quarter of a Suns game and it wasn't on ONE TV! Is this a sports bar for people from Minnesota? And there was some idiot reading BINGO numbers using a bullhorn. Too cheap for a PA system? I cannot express how much I hated this place. DON'T BOTHER STOPPING IN!,1
"Still a great location, but we had some items stolen from our room. Hotel was not very helpful about it and their insurance company rejected our claim. I won't sue because it is a few hundred dollars, but they were generally just d cks about the whole thing. Although it is inexpensive and a good location, I doubt I'd go back. I probably wouldn't go back if it was free.",1
"We got 50 off our meal here with our show tickets so it was well worth the price. Due to the discount, I had filet mignon which was cooked perfectly. Also I had the best martini ever! My husband had the surf and turf which was also well done. Its a very casual atmosphere but the food was of high quality.",2
"Excellent Vibes nThe food was Good, but rather overpriced for what it is. 14 for a grande steak burrito that would normally cost about 8 bucks elsewhere. But its Vegas. VERY PROFESSIONAL Managerial staff. Handled an issue well and treated us with utmost respect. We left here satisfied because of Bob! Thanks for the help.",2
Brought 3 small children. Had the 11.99 Alfredo specials AND used an email coupon for a free dessert. The staff treated us like we we're spending a million dollars. The manager checked on us a few times. They spoiled us completely. It was like being at the Four Seasons. They were so sweet with the children. Will go back again for sure.,2
"Nothing memorable here. I hate to write this, but there was no zip or bam to this at all. I had the scallop and shrimp, she had the grouper. Presentation on both were fairly plain. The scallops were a little chewy, and quite bland. Same on the grouper. We split a half bottle of wine that was cheap but OK. I really expected more from this place and was REALLY disappointed.",1
"This place was the biggest disappointment ever. Definitely on the list of the worst restaurant meals I've had. I ordered the chicken pad thai and gross. It was horrible and tasted dry. If you do order it share, the portion is HUUUUGEE. This place gets two stars because the customer service was good.",1
"This is the first place in pittsburgh I've found that produces truly raw, fresh, cold pressed juices. There are shops like this all over LA, SF, and NY, but Pittsburgh is a little lacking. Or was until now. Their green juice is very smooth and super refreshing. It's a small space, but in San Francisco they sell juice out if little closets on the street. Definitely worth checking out!",2
"Like Stu, I've also been privy to the cesspit like delights of the toilets at Drouthy's, but as a man who likes to live life on the edge, took it one step further by actually defecating in them. Considering the bog roll was only marginally cleaner than a surgeon's apron, such a task is not for the faint hearted. But life is for living, so you've got to try it at least once.",2
"movie food drinks I'm a fan! My only problem with this theatre is that half the rows consist of office chairs. After awhile, these chairs become some of the most uncomfortable seats. If you are smart enough to reserve some of the big leather seats beforehand, you are set! I wish this theatre was closer to home!",2
"Flavors Buffet at Harrah's was very very good. We ate here before the Legends show which we also really enjoyed. The buffet has a great variety of fresh food. I enjoyed the crab legs and other meaty choices. I stayed away from the deserts, but those looked equally tasty. I would highly recommend this buffet for it's quality. Rick D, San Diego, CA.",2
"Love, Love, LOVE this place! One of the best places for eggplant parm in the area! Alfredo sauce is amazing! Oh and they serve stracciatella which was absolutely delish! Very reminiscent of my Grandmother's cooking when I was growing up! Great service. very friendly, attentive, helpful but not overbearing. Don't miss the desserts. fabulous!",2
"Came here for food and drink. No complaints. The turkey burger was so darn delicious and I'd come back just for that. The fries were a mix of every type of fry you can imagine waffle, shoe string, steak etc which was interesting. The drinks were very tasty. Yes its a celebrity chef restaurant and it was pricey but I came away very satisfied.",2
"I really like Flancer's Cafe. My favorite item on the menu is the Prickly Pear chicken sandwich. The service here is quick and the staff is friendly. They serve Odell beer, too, so that's a big plus. I like a lot of the restaurants in the downtown Gilbert area and Flancer's is definitely one to check out if you are in Gilbert.",2
"I have been coming to this location of Ted Wiens for over a year for my automative needs. From the quail it's of work by their auto techs to the courteous, knowledgeable service advisors, I highly recommend Ted Wiens at Fort Apache and Flamingo. No problem is too great. I appreciate their candor and professionalism. Thank you, Christian, Jack and Randy.",2
"Whaaaat?! You guys showed Haze NO love! I went 4th of July weekend 2010 and had a blast! Maybe my experience was better than some because we bypassed the line went right in. I like how big it is. I don't like going to a club and feeling as if I'm sharing a drink with the persoext to me. My friends I danced on the little cube thing on the dance floor. It's a cool spot. May have to go back, soon ",2
"An excellent family run restaurant tucked away in a somewhat forlorn shopping center. The employees are always very attentive and food is outstanding. The avgolemono and Fat Greek Gyro are very good. The Tzatziki is perfect, the vegetables are always fresh, and the meat very flavorful. I definitely look forward to exploring the menu more.",2
"Went here with a couple of friends for dinner and really enjoyed the food! We ordered egg rolls, shrimp fried rice, and shrimp panang. The egg rolls were so good, we ordered another batch lol. The fried rice and panang were delicious as well. My friends ordered garlic chicken as well and didn't enjoy that. Other than that, service was good and waiters are friendly.",2
"Quite forgettable, at least I hope I forget about it. There's better food at an employee cafeteria with an atmosphere comparable to that. Very little selection and what was there was dry. Not everything was awful some items were good but not good enough to justify the effort of going there again. There are so many great buffets in Vegas this wouldn't make the top 1000.",1
"I went to Cosmos once for lunch, and the Cajun chicken panini wasn't bad. I went back again for half off appetizers, and was horribly disappointed. We got the crab dip, which has no discernible pieces of crab meat and tasted as if the whole dip including meat had been pureed. We also got the stuffed mushrooms, which arrived shriveled and left too much to be desired.",1
Reasonable Mexican food at rock bottom prices. Great cocktails too. I went with a large group of people on a hot day and it was a little uncomfortable in the small dining area most people had to go outside at some point for air. Other than that we all had a nice meal and were impressed by the service.,2
"Wonderful food and great service. I love that they always have a different soup every time we come, which is served before the salad that's included with our entr u00e9e. If there's something you need to change with your meal, that's not a problem. They are very accommodating and will go above and beyond to make sure your experience is top notch.",2
"This is a great place for kids, especially 3 7. Hands on, interactive exhibits, a new science show, and crafts make this a great place. I was a little disappointed that the new location and renovation didn't convince them to add exhibits for some of the older kids, my daughter is nine and although she still likes the place, she really didn't learn anything new.",2
"This is my second review for Bella Salon. This time I knew what to expect. The man in the front is super friendly, he gets you a seat as soon as he can. I got the pedi. It comes with a hot stone massage, and foot rub. They also give you water with fruit in it. This place is really ""classy "", it has massage chairs that are well kept and curtains to give you privacy. All this for only 25 . Relaxing!",2
"0 stars, this place hasn't been worth the cost of green fees since it was the Scottsdale country club. The palmer nine added later is not bad but the remodel of the original 18 in search of real estate for condos etc was a heinous use of ground. I have played here twice in benefit tournament and would never play it otherwise.",1
"I went into this store because I wanted to make some great homemade carne. My husband and I were not treated very well at all, the prices were great though, and they have a wide variety, that is why I gave it a two star. I just did not appriceiate how we were treated by the employees that were working here. I will not go back I will be going down the street to Marianas from now on.",1
"I came to town for a conference and lucked out with a great Yelp coupon and Pete! It's now a week later and I'm still feeling the goodness from his excellent work. He did an excellent balance between the orthopedic work my feet and legs needed and deep relaxation the rest of me needed. nFabulous! Thanks, Pete!",2
"Terrible value. This place should be like 70 a night. nNo free breakfast, expensive wireless, pillows were either laughably huge or flat as a pancake, bad smells, no ventilation in bathroom, filthy carpet, cuddled creamer for the coffee. These are just some of the complaints that our entire group had, across over a dozen rooms.",1
"Other than the fact that they sell Sinclair gas I can't think of a reason to go back. i just had the truck washed, and I'm not expecting a detail, but for the Super, I expect my truck to actually be clean I shouldn't have to hunt on the floor for my things that were in the cup holders! I will not return!",1
"I would've given it 5 stars because I did have a lot of fun! However, the boys I were with were dying! It's hot enough as it is in Vegas, they definitely need to add some fans in the outside areas. Drinks are pricy, but that's the same anywhere in Vegas. Other than the heat situation, the ambiance was great! Music was great, no other complaints here.",2
I have had good experiences with the staff here however the area is terrible. This is a hot spot for the panhandlers in the area. I can think of at least a couple of times when their begging made my guests feel uncomfortable. I am not saying this is a bad venue just that you should be aware of this issue when choosing a spot for seeing friends or a date.,1
"A piece of Mexico downtown Phoenix. A common visit after hiking South Mountain, specially to drink some ""aguas frescas "". If you can, you can even mix horchata with any other flavor! Many mexican products! variety of chiles and salsas. This place is better than Food City. The carnitas they have, are just excellent! try them or take them home.",2
"i think it's a good deal for all you can eat sushi for 27. n A few of my favs No Name Roll Spicy tuna asparagus wrapped with a layer of yellowtail n Spider Roll I ask for it with no crab less fillers, plus it taste better nSushi hamachi, surf clam, raw sweet shrimp comes with the shirmp head deep fried! mmmm such goodness! ,snapper. All topped off with Green Tea Ice Cream! ",2
"VERY authentic. Makes sense as the head chef dim sum was kidnapped by Mafiosos right out of Hong Kong. Every item you try, will either be a 3 5 star experience, or 4 5 star experience, but you'll have mostly 4 5 star experiences. I dine fully comped, so I don't know if it's expensive or not, but dim sum here is one of the few reasons why I might want to wake up early ish in Vegas.",2
"My fiance and I went to the Custom Shop for my birthday dinner and it brought a good end to a great birthday. The service was perfect attentive yet not intrusive, and we both loved our dishes. The menu changes frequently so there's ample opportunity to try something new. They also offer fresh baked bread that is SO GOOD, the server didn't even judge when I asked for more like 10 times!",2
"Very good tex mex food. Our service was excellent and both times I went the manager came over to check on us, and made an excellent wine suggestion! I had no idea wine went with Mexican food, but it was amazing! Their veggie fajitas with black beans and lime cilantro rice are an excellent vegan option! Margaritas are good too!",2
Kaya is my ace in the hole. This is the place I take visiting family and friends. We've never been disappointed. The jerk wings take me back to the road side stand in the caymans. Conk and corn chowder warms the soul. If I where to pick favorite it would be the Kaya chips and salsa. I would love to see more seafood and a skirt steak that's not tossed in a salad.,2
My businesses have used PC Perfect for years and I cannot say enough good things about their services. They come on site quickly wheeeded and keep my offices running. We have some pretty complex systems running different types of software and PC Perfect manages to keep everything running. I would definitely recommend their services.,2
"Good, authentic Hawaiian food in the middle of the desert. I enjoyed their Kalua Pig with Cabbage, Pork Laulau, Lomi Salmon, Chicken Long Rice and Manapua steamed buns . This place has been around for years and there's a reason why. They should open another location in Phoenix preferably near 16th st. and Camelback. ",2
"Salted caramel. Need I say more? I am a cupcake snob. This place wasn't my favorite but passed the test. Both the Red Velvet and Salted Caramel were delicious, moist and full of great flavor both in the cake and the icing. It's also fun to sit here and look across the street at the beautiful church!",2
"Went to Lotus of Siam because numerous magazine articles proclaimed it "" the best Thai food in America "". Well, maybe it's the best Thai barf in America. What a gross, greasy pile of crap was served to us. And not cheap despite it's location in some out of the way strip mall. Plus, good luck to get a cab to take you back to your hotel. Red 8 at the Wynn is outstanding for Thai. Go there instead.",1
"I heard that this was a Christian family run company. Turns out the son there is the biggest lying, cheating and thieving crook I've ever met. The father seems nice and the staff are all fine, but the place is run by the son who is just an awful person. I would avoid the store entirely just because of this man. He'll rob you blind and spit in your face.",1
"This is the worst indian place I have been to in a while. No flavor in any dishes when selecting a spice level of 7 10, you would expect some taste in a dish. The chicken tikka tandoori was horrible, it smelled as if something was rotting. most indian restaurants marinate chicken well, this one seems to have bypassed that stage altogether",1
My stylist was Cesar Ramirez! He's amazing! From start to finish he had me entertained and well informed. Giving me tips about how to take care of my hair. He had me laughing. The atmosphere was awesome. He took his time and I was beyond happy with the outcome! I literally can't go anywhere now without getting compliments on my hair! Thank u Cesar!,2
"Stayed here twice, both for bachelorette parties. Def a girly, fun hotel. Decor is lovely and rooms are nice. The cool thing about this hotel is that they have balconies, I am not a smoker but my gfs who smoked loved this feature. nOnly annoying this is the long walks from the room to the main floor, so easy to get lost too.",2
"Excellent ambience, great service all around, good portions, beautiful food and great prices. Hands down an excellent place for dinner with friends, family or on a date. My husband and I ordered a variety of foods to taste more dishes and were impressed by them all. We ate 2 entrees, soup, appetizer and 2 beers for 60. Enjoy",2
"Lunch buffet is medicore at best, def. better food to be had elsewhere. I usually only go there for the chaat. However, today we were informed that the restaurant wasn't taking any chaat orders as the kitchen was too busy, all after the waitress had already taken our order. Meanwhile, one or two other customers were given chaat orders to go, I'm guessing they called ahead of time.",1
We were looking for a small place close to home to watch the UFC 182 fights. Their website said they have the fights. Went there to watch UFC and when we arrive there's a note on the door that due to lack of interest and cost they will not be showing the UFC fight. Maybe they should be updating their website more often. Didn't even stay to try the food.,1
By far one of the worst fast food places! So disappointed. Service is sucks. I don't appreciate how I work all day to earn and go for a quick bite and get ripped off. It is not my fault you didn't finished school or dropped out and have no education and now your stuck working minimum wage . But don't rip other people off by the crappy service and crappy food.,1
"That's right. Im writing about a Wendys. Well. When you impress me on all levels, this is what you get. Well done Wendys. Food came out looking like it does in the commercials and ever so fast. The staff was friendly and experienced. Annnnnnndd it was delicious. Enjoy! nPS. I love you chocolate frosty. nIan M.",2
"Oh boy this is a ghetto Target. Not only are the people in it really sketchy but the store is trashed. It literally looked like someone walked through and knocked everything off the shelves in one aisle. The workers just ignored customers and pushed carts into people. It was a bit of a disaster. I did find what I was looking for, so I guess that's all that matters.",1
"I have gone here off and on for years. I would say you get what you pay for, it's not as cheap as supercuts, but they spend more time and do a better job, and not quite as expensive as some other places, that may do a more professional cut. Overall, decent cut, for not too much money, so I would recommend.",2
Everything was great except the steaks. The lettuce wedge salad was excellent and the service was good as was the atmosphere. My wife had a small fillet that was just ok. I had a NY strip that didn't look like any NY strip I've ever had before. It was 1 2 inch thick and looked like a breakfast steak. There are way better options for a steak at this price.,1
"So I have been to the location in Tucson and now experienced this one and I have to say that I did not have a WOW or YUMMM drooling moment at either. Don't get me wrong it's not horrible it just has no wow factor at all to me and I will pass next time. There is just better Mexican cuisine out there, nService was promt though!",1
"Definitely a little gimicky.but you know what.the food is good and it all works fine.hole in the wall type joint that keeps it simple, yet is on the border of trying to do much.but its all good. its not rocket science, and its not the typical izakaya. sure its not Kappo Honda or Hondaya, but for Vegas. its a nice spot. Food Service are great.will come back someday.",2
Bad service and bad food! I waited for over a half hour to get my food and I had to ask before the waitress realized she forgot my order. When I got my sandwich the chicken was dry and I didn't even finish it. Also to make matters worse they took trash through the dining area while we were eating. Have some pride.,1
World class vietnamese. Love 49 basically vietnamese grilled chicken salad and 61 Curry chicken and 137 Chicken Lemon Grass. Service is higly attentive.I dare you to try and empty your water glass. Nguyen will remember what you ordered on your second visit and can even make you something special if you want to be surprised. Would eat here 3 4 nights a week if it were closer.,2
This restaurant is amazing! The quality of the food was great. I couldn't believe how cheap it was and The portions are huge. I've tried other curry restaurants and this one is at the top of the list. The staff was very friendly and the inside of the place was very clean. I Totally recommend this spot.,2
"Sole is a great asset to Waterloo. Very cool atmosphere, great food, good wine list. I've been here several times over the years and have been satisfied with every visit. We have even brought my toddler with us a few times and they have been very accommodating with his meals. Sole is always top of our list of places to bring people when they are visiting us from out of town.",2
"The servers were polite and very knowleageable, but they are eager to take orders. Frequently check back tables. nAppetizer is weak. not very many options but the quality is pretty good. I like pumpkin porridge although they added too much starch in it. nSushi quality is as same as other AYCE sushi restaurants.",2
"I've been going to Plan B since my freshman year in college, on baby night Thurs , and it, 3 years later, is still my favorite club bar in Madison. They keep it classy, but fun. The bartenders are great, so are the dancers shout out to Spiderman! . It's a safe, fun place to go out, dance, have a couple of drinks and meet some fun people!",2
Great food with large portions. The beer selection is very good and always changing I highly suggest the Better Off Red . Inside d u00e9cor is inviting and the outside patio is a great addition. Have been to large group events at their banquet room and left very satisfied. Take the family there and the kids always get treated well. My favorite brew pub.,2
"I used to love this place when it was Park Central, but now it is no bueno. It's a huge happy hour hot spot for cool people, but the food is mediocre at best. For example we ordered chicken and steak tacos on happy hour and all we got were tortillas with meat and cilantro. Really? Gordon bierch serves better tacos than this place. Overpriced and overhyped in my opinion.",1
"What the heck! I go in for these specialty doughnuts that look fabulous and there is NO specialty what so ever! With this place being a 24 hour business, all doughnuts should be offered at ALL times. So after i drove 40 min to this place, I ended up with some ok, nothing special, doughnuts. Don't waste your time going here. I could get better doughnuts at a chain. So disappointed.",1
"Went there for lunch today for the first time and had the gumbo, while my colleague has the jambalaya. The food and service were both outstanding, and while we were never rushed, we were in and out in less than an hour. The atmosphere was comfortable and the prices quite reasonable very nice for a business lunch. I'm looking forward to going for dinner.",2
The decor was bright and wonderful. Our server looked totally comfortable in her pajama uniform which reflected in her excellent service. The French pressed coffee was delicious especially next to the yummy pot of bread. The place misses the mark in the steak and eggs. They were just not cooked to the way I ordered but still good. I will totally come back try more on the menu.,2
"Very disappointed. Won't stay here again. Stayed here only for WSOP. Front desk service slow. No coffee in room. Room stunk. Key did not work twice on different days. Filthy head boards. Old pillows. Waited 20 minutes for valet, so we self parked. When we returned to our car, we found a major dent in the door.",1
"This is strictly a ""produce as much as possible "" for the masses. The food used to be good. it is now made with cheap ingredients and tastes like oil. It is pretty bad and the salsa has taken a real dive too. It used to be fun and enjoyable. Now it seems like an overpriced fast food place. Don't go!",1
"I went here a few years ago. The staff was so rude to me and stand offish to both my friend and I that I refuse to go back. I've heard that because of the bad economy they have since had to lay off the entire staff. Maybe now that they're desperate, they'll be nicer to potential customers. Either way, I still won't go back.",1
"I visit this store at least 5 times a year. All of the employees are so nice all the time, But yesterday I was helped by one of the rudest clerks ever. She was very short with me as well as other customers. Management needs to take a long look at this employee. We don't come to this store and spend 100 to be treated rudely.",1
Don't know what's all the hype bout this place. Obviously had way better cuz I'm from Frisco. But had better Pho down the street from this place. Hmmm maybe cuz I'm not drunk like all the other viewers here. Am I coming back when I'm drunk? Maybe but to the other place down the block with fresher herbs to start off.,1
"If you've ever been to Korea, you will be nothing short of disappointed. To begin with, it is terribly overpriced. You could get five times the food in Korea at the same price as this place. Soju is criminally expensive, and to top it off, the meat is poor quality. None of the standard side dishes are served, and the service is minimal at best. Do not waste your money or time.",1
"Best yogurt place in S. Chandler. Tried Fresco and Golden Spoon, but neither compare to this. Friendly service, bright open spaces, and clean everything. Cost model is simple get what you want dozen different flavors, cone cup, toppings, and fresh fruit on top then it's 0.38 oz. Hint there's even free WiFi and a Mac for customers to surf online or write their yelp review . Shhhh.",2
"I'm partial to this place because I met my wonderful boyfriend there, but this place is awesome! I love the selection of beers. I can't say much about the food because I haven't tried it! As a bar, however, I highly recommend it! Interesting people, cool interior, and when it's warm out they raise the garage door to get that outside inside feel! Try it out! n ",2
First time taking Charlie here for her last shot after we adopted her. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful as well. Our doctor was great at answering all the questions we had being first time puppy parents Location is also perfect walking distance and next to one of our favorite breakfast joints Scramble! Which is dog friendly Definitely will be Charlie's permanent doggy hospital.,2
This is where you can get not only good Oreintal food but good American choices. They have a wide selection and a sushi bar that is one of the best around. I love it when they have the dishes I like. I don't like it when something I usually like is not available. The sevice is always very good and all you can eat wow! That is good for the whole family or a group of people!,2
Love Metro Pizza's Tropicana location. We have come to expect exceptional food and service from Metro. This location hardly resembles Metro. The garlic knots are half the size and overcooked. The service at this location was horrible. The only person that seemed to be actually working was the bus person. I will not return to this location. Will drive the extra distance to Tropicana.,1
"Our favourite place to drink during our recent visit to Edinburgh. nVery cool gothic look, red and black leather decor with lots of wood couple this with the sultry romantic mood lighting and it was the perfect place for post Valetines dinner drinks. Will deffo be going back next time we're up that way!",2
"I loved the old Cafe Monmartre and they've certainly paid homage to it by keeping the great vibe that Monmartre had! The inside has an industrial farm chic feel, very cozy and cool at the same time. The drinks are outstanding I have had the 'daily punch' several times and at 5 a glass it's a great deal too! Great place to bring your foodie friends, come either early or late to avoid a wait.",2
"The atmosphere of the place is nice. It feels like home. The service also feels like you're in your best friend's kitchen. After answering a ""Star Wars Question of the Day "", I was given a free desert! They also offered me a free buttered slice of bread while I waited for my sandwich. This is a hidden treasure in Las Vegas.",2
"It is extremely clean. They have a 6 loader washer for 5.59, a four loader washer for 4.59, a three loader washer for 3.59 and a single loader washer for 1.25. The dryerS are 1.69 for 40 mins. They use cards instead of coins that you can get there. The only bad things are their are flys everywhere! Also their is no air conditioner only fans so you are poring sweat while you wait",2
"Super helpful friendly staff here! I was on hold with Verizon dealing with an issue that took so long, I decided to find the closest actual physical Verizon store and found this one. Drove 20 minutes here and was helped and greeted immediately and they totally resolved my issue. Didn't catch the name of the associate who helped me but I took this action shot of him in action that's posted here ",2
Enjoyed Happy Hour with friends last night and I had a fabulous time. I ordered one of my regular appetizers Trio of dipping sauces good stuff. I was in the mood for coffee and was told that a new pot of coffee was brewing at that moment. Coffee was yummy. Great service that alone is priceless. Thank you to the Staff at Ticoz. Cheers ,2
"If your gas light has been on so long that walking and buying a gas can is the only other option, go here. CONSISTENLY THE HIGHEST, MOST UNREASONABLE GAS PRICES IN SOUTHEAST CHARLOTTE. Haven't found the staff to be terribly endearing either but, the store is clean. There is almost never anyone there. It's safe, as CMPD is regularly patrolling the area.",1
"I work in fine dining and am a self proclaimed foody, so I'm not ignorant when it comes to judging food. Everything was delicious, the sauces that complimented every dish were excellent, and flavors were layered expertly. nThe stuffed dates wrapped in bacon were exceptional. Service was professional and attentive. Atmosphere was both casual and classy. A very nice experience.",2
"I came here w my girlfriend and my sister and had a few drinks, though we barely missed happy hour we had a great time. Definately try the bikini tini if you like martinis. I wouldn't recommend the bbq chicken pizza unless you like very strong bbq sauce. The calamari is good, very wide selection of beers. Is a little pricey but definately a great hangout.",2
"It never ceases to amaze me, that girls will happily wander round a shop like this for hours, browsing soaps, talcums and lotions, none of which appear to do anything out of the ordinary apart from smell a bit whimsical. IT'S JUST SOAP, AND WILL STINK WHEN YOU RUB IT ON YOUR ARSECRACK ANYWAY. I don't see the point, but if it makes you happy then fair enough.",2
"The sushi rolls had good flavor, but were very small and still expensive. Not to mention, the service was terrible. Not worth the trip. Too many other great sushi options around the NW Valley. Squid Ink, across the street, is great and really fun! Sakana on 59th is an excellent choice as well, just a further drive. Would not eat at Fresh Wasabi again. ",1
"A good local brewery with excellent food! We had the garlic beer bread to start, which was well balanced and tasty. We had the chicken avocado beer bread wrap, chicken caprese sandwich and nemo pita. The pita had tons and tons if fish, and they were all large servings. Fries are well battered and very crunchy just the way I like them!",2
"Very disappointing! Went there for Christmas dinner I got rack of lamb with mashed potatoes both awful, the potatoes had no flavor, and the lamb was just not good. My spouse got prime rib and that was terrible, had no flavor and very chewy. For 120 I expect excellent food, the only thing good was the salad and soup. Don't waste you money go somewhere else!",1
"Very rude. I ordered for delivery and it took them an hour and a half to get a burrito to my house. The food was cold, and when warmed up it was lacking at best. Very little flavor and bad texture. When i called to contact the manager, the owner answered and hung up on me. Just go to Dos Reales if you want good Mexican food with friendly service.",1
"This is the best place ever! nI called about my iPhone 4S to be repaired. The front and back were both cracked, the gentlemen said no problem. I went down there it was very reasonable to repair and was done in an hour. Picked it up and it was like brand new. Loved the service and I would go back anytime. Thanks guys!",2
"I went to Vegas and had a reservation here and eventhough I pre paid thru Car Rentals.com, the wait was insane, when we got to the counter the rep said we were lucky usually the wait per him, is about 2 hours! Make plans. The car we got was alright, I rather have a nicer car and eventhough we hinted we ended up with the Ford Focus, oh heck who cares, jsut get me out of this airport!",1
"One of my favorite spots in Central Phoenix! They have an ever changing beer menu and with each change, the beer is getting better and more interesting! I came in for a good local beer and was surprised by the food choices and the quality of the food. This brewery has hit the mark for overall places to visit great beer, food, and atmosphere! I will be back, and have been back several times.",2
"This is my favorite Chinese place for take out. I love their Singapore rice noodles and they will turn up the heat on this if you ask them 6.95. I've also had their Thai style pineapple fried rice, and it was delicious. I've never eaten inside the restaurant. I'm going to have to try other plates since they have such a large menu.",2
"For the price. they are crazy! LOL. And when I went, it was with work so it was paid for by my boss I still couldn't enjoy it Fish was poorly cooked seasoned. Some pasta was ok. The best thing was my salad. The desserts were no diff than the smaller casino's buffets. I guess I was expecting more was very disappointed!",1
"If one must have one item from this place, it is the kobe tartar. The dish has the right flavor and the beef is so tender. Simply amazing. All the dishes, both the tapas and the sushi rolls are good. If only the place is easy to find and the waiters are friendlier I would have given this place a 5 stars instead of 4.",2
"I really enjoyed the curry here, but the service left something to be desired. My friend and I ordered the same thing and it took about 45 minutes for us to get our food. The waitress blamed it on the cooks, but I have a suspicion that she just forgot to put in the order. Good for the food, just ignore the service.",1
Went here tonight for the first time and had an amazing experience. EVERYTHING we tried was wonderful. All the flavors were great and the food was very unique. The atmosphere was very chic and the service was fantastic. Would definitely go back as well as try other restaurants the chef owns. Our waiter Jermal was the best!,2
Service is fantastic. Friendly and efficient. The food is home cooked. For example the potatoe skins are not purchased frozen and then deep fried. Real potatoes that the cooks prepare. The shepherd pie is made of lamb like it should be. The ribeye was juicy and delicious. Great selection of beer too. I will be back next time I am in Madison.,2
"This restaurant was recommended by our concierge on our first night and I have to say, I was disappointed. My friend had the calamari and shrimp which was tasteless. The escargot was not what it should taste like and was covered with oil and baked cheese. I ordered a chicken dish with rice and salad which was also tasteless. I do have to say at least the chicken was not dried. But not a fan.",1
"Great breakfasts with fresh ingredients and huge portions. The California Benedict is exceptionally good, with avocados, spinach and hollandaise sauce. Their sausage is homemade and absolutely delicious. The hash browns appear to be homemade too. An excellent experience that we will repeat as soon as possible!",2
"Definitely a secret, this place is so well hidden in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. The door was closed when I went during the day and was kind of confused on how to even get in. Great place for a quick bite individually sold slices . I didn't know this place was open late until walking back from Marquee one night. WIll definitely have to stop by late night during the next Vegas trip.",2
Don't go after 8 30. Their staff only cares about closing up and ignores anyone still in the restaurant. Never received garlic bread and had to ask for refund and they took away the iced tea from the beverage station with 5 6 tables still occupied. May never go back. Only giving 2 stars because food was good and the cashier re stocked the Tootsie Pop display.,1
"We are out of town guest. We keep coming back. The drinks are reasonable compared to NYC. The soup is amazing and so is the pad thai. We really liked our server. He's amazing and made us feel like home. We forget his name but he has two dogs, including a German Shepard. He so deserves a raise! I recommend everyone come here!",2
"If I could give no stars I would. 800 for one pair of glasses that I can't use. The measuring camera outfit is smoke mirrors. My wife had the same experience with her 1000 glasses. Emailed them and they thanked me for my feedback and said they were ""sorry. "" If you have money to throw away, and don't care if you can see with your new glasses, then this is the place to go!",1
"Had a 7 45 reservation was seated at 8 30. Scallops were rubbery, sea bass wasn't as stellar as the server was raving about. Lobster kimchee fried rice wasn't anything to write home about. The only things we enjoyed were the appetizers crab cakes and lobster ravioli. For the price, I'd rather go to Hakkasan.",1
Old Navy for hipsters. This place was a wreck. I understand it is located in a high traffic area and they get a lot of visitors but it's just a mess. I saw this place one night after they closed and made a point to come back during the next day. Most of the clothing looks like it would fall apart within a few weeks.looks good but poorly and cheaply made. I checked it out and walked out.,1
"Both dishes were excellent. From the specials menu Lamb Tacos and Chicken Enchilada. The Enchilada had a roasted pepper sauce and over easy eggs on top. Such a perfect combination. There were many unique margarita options as well. Service was thorough and snappy. Plus they provided endless fancy pitchers of water, and who doesn't need that while in Vegas?",2
"Nice little hole in the wall with simple fresh Mexican food. There's a full bar and happy hour from 4 7 everyday! I'll admit, the shopping center this place is in may put you off. don't be scared. The restaurant is a bit dated. continue not being scared. Total comfort food awaits for those not easily deterred.",2
This is a Chinese food place primarily not an Asian fusion. The two rolls that we got Las Vegas Roll and Crunchy Roll were flavorless and almost made my wife vomit. The Chinese food was rather good chicken friend rice and sweet sour chicken Pro tip Avoid the Japanese portion of their menu and center in on the Chinese portion to be safe. Their sushi was neither fresh or tasty.,1
"Nice to see a sports bar up this way. There are not too many non chain one. Bambinos was a nice clean open feeling place. The server was great did a good job. The food while it appeared to be a little expensive, was really good and worth it. I had a Philly, fries and coke. I enjoyed all of it. Nice flavor to the philly.",2
I was experiencing upper back pain that was interferring with my day to day activities. I went to see Dr. Sutton hoping to get some relief that day. He yook xrays and told me he couldn't do any adjustments until he looked at the xrays the next day. He did offer to put the muscle stimulators on my back but that doesn't really help much.,1
2 words. FUC !NG Amazing! we had the Sage chicken Benedict and it was definitely more than enough for me and my wife. I also ordered a side of biscuit and gravy which was unbelievable but unecessary since we were not even close to finishing it since we were stuffed lol. The wait is kinda long but definitely worth the wait. Hit up the bar inside while you wait. They have great hangover fixes.,2
"First of all, the waitress was so rude! It was my first time eating here with my husband and I was really disappointed! My patty was pretty burnt! The fries were good, super crispy! It was extremely loud and I'd rather go to McDonalds for a burger, yes. That's how bad my experience was. They will never see me walk in those doors again.",1
"Am I at Whole Foods? nI have been going to the Barnes and Noble near this place forever and wasn't really sure what this place was about so never stopped in. nWell, I regret not stopping in earlier now. I highly recommend it. It's nice to come home with some Kale and other vegan treats! I will be coming here more ofteow.",2
"Our FAVORITE place in Chandler for tacos. The Carne Asada, beef tongue, and pork stomach tacos are amazing. The kids love the cheese quesadilla. The staff is super friendly. I knew it was good when I was the only non hispanic person eating there. Very authentic. I love that they have a bar for condiments, too.",2
"We have been looking for a good BBQ place in Vegas for a while and we believe we have found it. The brisket chopped up was excellent as was the pulled pork sandwich. The green beans with bacon is really good and the shoe string onion rings are too. Plus, kids eat free on Sundays and you get free ice cream! We'll be back.",2
"We live in Plaza Midwood, and we can get food delivered from there. The person who took our order and the delivery driver were both very attentive and courteous. The food was really great hot temperature , perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and yummy. The portions were large, which means a lot of leftovers. We will definitely order from them again.",2
"I Love Thai food. I started off with an appetizer of Thai Egg rolls, I've had many different Thai places since I've been to Las Vegas, this is by far the best experience I've had so far. I also had the Musaman Chicken Curry and it was amazing. I loved every part of it. Great affordable fast delivery. Definitely recommend to everyone.",2
Came here again cause my friends wanted to come here. We came in a busy time. Which we got a table pretty fast 5 mins. The food carts was all out pushing about. The food taste better. I'm not sure if it was because I was really hungry or maybe it was much fresher. I'll go with it was fresher cause it was busy. Hehee,2
"The worst service so slow over 5 minutes just to get a menu, another 5 to get drinks then another 15 just to get food. Oh wait we never got our food because the server said I had to be patient translation you're going to get your food whenever its ready . We finally walked out since we never got anything. Never again",1
It's not as good as you hope. It's not a real pub. And the food is less than mediocre. I guess the real reason to stop in is for the beer. The place does look inviting but there is no table service and all the food is prepackaged. The sandwiches were mostly stale bread with very little fixings on them. We would have been better off trying a fast food spot,1
"Not impressed at all. Food was mediocre and the atmosphere reminded me of the old kosher restaurants. I live in NY, where the kosher restaurants are nicer and food much better. The owner was obnoxious and rude, they were short staffed. The one good thing, it was nice to be able to have a kosher meal out.",1
"Very helpful, all of your favorite titles, monthly pull for your books, guest artists signings, sales events, friendly staff.this place really has it all. Here's a huge plus no gamers or D D type people here. Straight up comics. When you walk in the average age is above 14 so if you're an adult, you feel a little more comfortable here. Definitely one of the best shops in the valley",2
"I'm not a fan of indoor malls. but Caesar's makes it easier with the high ceilings and clouds sky painted above you. You can find anything and everything here mostly high end stores . When I am rich, I will actually do more than some window shopping. Ah, I love Dior and D G. Sigh. It would be best to avoid the window shopping if you don't want to be depressed. ",2
"Nice place to grab a cold one and listen to some live music. They have everything here that you need to drink.Red Bull to Vanilla Vodka, and lots of flavors of Carbonated Malt Beverages! The band was Rug Burn and they played some killer cover tunes. There was a wide variety of clientele there, from early 20's Hotties, to some seasoned veterans. Overall a good time!",2
"This place is great, thank you yelp. We saw the high rating checked it out this past Sunday and were not disappointed. We did a la carte sushi rolls, but the all you can eat deal sounds great. The rolls were amazing and the wait staff was great. The only issue was the sign, it still said Brain's Beach Sushi, this being the first visit it definitely was confusing.",2
when in the niche for high end chef knifes place to be. They carry such a large fast amount. When I shop I normally caot get out of the place without spending no less then 200 but worth it. They carry such a range of knifes too witch is good for people in industry. When I am always looking for good stuff I go here. They also do sharpening. !,2
"What can I say, if you have been to 1 Chipotle you have been to them all. One downside I have noticed here is that if you place a large group order online, they have a tendency to mess it up. But if you give them a call they have never put up a fight about making it right either then or next time you are in.",2
"It was just ok, I got up sold for the hand wax and then tipped pretty well in advance to assure a good job, when It was ready the didn't really do a good job cleaning the inside, still had trash in the floor and door panels. Outside and tires wet pretty good though. I would say just use them for te cheap exterior wash next time",1
"So after our first visit we came back, unfortunately this time was terrible. We were served our salad and there was a ROCK in mine which when I bit down on chipped my tooth! The manager said she had to call security, no apology nothing, as if I had made this up! 30 minutes later we are sitting here still waiting for security.",1
"Food is decent but the place needs to staff up to handle the rather brisk takeout business. Tables around us were left dirty, entrees were delivered several minutes apart, and our waiter was very distracted by the phone orders he had to take. Again, the food is good but the dining room service was awful.",1
"Best tacos EVER! Pernil tacos was AH MAZING! My hubby had the short rib barbacoa taco and a fish taco. He enjoyed both. Chips and salsa were great! Nice thick chips and tasty salsa. nOur server, Matt was top notch. He knew the menu, and he made some great suggestions. nThis may be my new favorite restaurant!",2
"Terrible experience. Waited in the drive thru for nearly 15 20 minutes, with only one car ahead of me. When I asked what was on the avocado burger, the women's response was ""avocados. "" Burger was okay. Nothing special. Also ordered a side of fried zucchini and found a hair in the batch. Needless to say, will never visit again.",1
"The food is always phenomenal and the service doesn't miss a beat. While some might find the enviroment a little loud and dark, I think it makes it less stuffy and more accessible to a not over the hill crowd. get there a little early ahead of your reservation time lots of scottsdale bimbos trying to cut in line.",2
"Thinking I would play it safe my first time here, I ordered the Asian Steak Salad. You can't ruin salad, right? Bleh! The steak was a cheap cut that was chewy and fatty. The mandarin oranges tasted like they came out of a can and the lettuce was wilted. Oh the apple bread was stale. Won't be paying a visit here again which is too bad as I live within walking distance.",1
"Something about high end Dim Sum bothers me. I mean. There was nothing wrong with the food, but. I just can't appreciate white gloved service when I'm eating Dim Sum. That shit should be loud, obnoxious, and the service should be rude. The food was fine, and the service was terrific. It's just not what I'm used to, so I feel like I was robbed of the Dim Sum experience.",1
"Lauretta is great. Not only is she sweet and personable, but she is also very educated when it comes to skin. She also doesn't hesitate sharing the information with you to help you along your journey of obtaining great skin. In just 2 treatments my melasma is looking so much better, all thanks to her!",2
"IDK why more people don't shop at this location. I found better deals here than I do at local outlets. I had to abruptly leave the store before stocking up on some awesome styles that were less than 40. If I'm not careful, I might just spend an hour here and buy something for every outfit. This store is definitely overlooked, and it's my new go to spot for casual athletic shoes.",2
This is our second time coming here. The guys are very friendly and always helping each other out. Very reasonable costs out the door. I would recommend this tire shop to anyone in a hurry or just needing some basic tire stuff done. Just off the 60 they are so easy to get to making the convenience and stress of it all worth it!,2
"Do your self a favor and skip the patty melt, perhaps the worst burger I have ever had in my life. The patty had no seasoning what so ever, the fries were not even warm. The bread was thick but hard on edges. Waiter never checked back u tip the end, only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it was open 24 hours and my fianc u00e9 liked her rueben.",1
"It is true what they say about the nachos. They are quite delicious. This is probably this best bar restaurant in Arizona. They have a lot of food options and they are all good I hear. They are a Vikings restaurant too so bonus points for that. Go Vikings! Everyone is very friendly. Parking is kind of a bitch, but whatever it is worth it. TVs everywhere is nice too.",2
"Jeff and his team are great! I called on Saturday and got an appointment for Wednesday, but called again on Sunday because my a c unit was making weird noises and he came out the next day Monday . Had the part on the truck, was courteous and quick in diagnosing the problem. The problem was fixed in less than an hour!",2
"If you want Soulfood, you'll get it here. It may not be my Grandmas cooking, but gotta someone else's Grandma's cooking, because of the home cooked taste of the food. I need to go back and try other items on the menu, But I had the Fried Chicken Cornbread, Collard Greens, and the Mac'n Cheese. So good. I gotta go back.",2
"The only word that comes to mind is ""meh. "" I came in here for a quick lunch while getting my brakes done across the street, and it was ""just lunch. "" Not much of a food menu. I had a chicken sandwich with bacon it was fine. Just fine. The service was fine, the bar had a couple of regulars. Cute little place, but for all the options in this city, it's really not worth another look from me.",1
We were seated right away but waited for a waiter to take our drink order. There were only 5 tables and after 5 minutes someone came to take our order. She was in a hurry and acted as if we were not important. Looking out the window while we were talking and asking questions and started walking away in the middle of the conversation. Service is terrible.,1
"Great atmosphere and really good food! We got great service, the kitchen was a little backed up the day we went but our server was up front about that and checked in with us often. I had the steak salad which was delicious, my sister had the French dip, and my daughter had the buffalo chicken sandwich.we all really enjoyed our food! I would definitely give this place a try.",2
"Would have been a 1 star but our waitress was super nice. Basically the worst rainforest cafe we've been to. Empty yet still took 20 mins to get seated. Mixed up all my kids orders. My food, ordered last by 15 mins, came out first yet our server said it was all sitting under the warming lights. Seriously.consider not coming here. You'll be disappointed.",1
"By far the worst McDonald's in the world. Employees are to busy playing grab ass behind the counter, to get your order correct. Ninety percent of the time you receive the wrong order, after waiting what seems an eternity. I've even enjoyed the experience of going through the drive thru, only to get home and find no beef patties on my Big Mac. Save yourself the aggravation, and do not go here.",1
"Be very careful if you use a Credit Debit Card here, the other night I went to get gas and the pump I was at was apparently all out? So I cancelled the transaction and moved to a different pump and for 24 hours I was charged 126 twice! Before it finally turned into 40. Man, I was about to kill this Chevron for overcharging me but luckily it was fixed within 24 hours.",1
"Bob, sales employee, was great to deal with. He was knowledgeable and was able to answer all of our questions without any pushy salesman qualities. We purchased a dining room table, 8 chairs, and a bedroom set from Pruitt's. Delivery completed without a hitch. Very professional and courteous delivery staff. We will make Pruitt's our first stop any time we need home furnishings.",2
"Unfortunately this show was NOT cirque at ALL! If you wanna pay 150 for animation, a hologram of Michael Jackson, and a WHOLE lot dancing, then go for it. But if you are looking for the amazement of acrobatic performances you won't get it here. You are better off watching THIS IS IT on a giant big screen TV. I love Michael but you pay that kind of Money when he's alive to give you the real thing.",1
"Buffett was moderate at best absolutely not worth the 50 per head we payed and 60 minute line we stood in. Crab legs were the best part, although some of the meat was caked with ice. Everything else I tried was average to below average. No self serve beverages and service was terrible. Didn't bring drinks til we were on plate 2 and no refills. Would not return.",1
I had a reading with Susan at the Changing Hands Bookstore in Tempe. The store does a great job of quickly and efficiently handing appointments. Susan was right on with her reading. She shared information with me that brought clarity and direction to my circumstances. I definitely would recommend her to anyone interested in getting reading.,2
My wife and I found this place while looking for something to eat before a Suns game. Great little sandwich shop with good food and great prices. I had the steak wrap and my wife had the chicken caesar wrap with the jalapenos. The food was perfect pre game food and it's location was walking distance to everything. I highly recommend Coney Islands for good inexpensive and quick food.,2
They are honestly lucky to have one star.the service was terrible.the pizza was mediocre and the prices were insane.the server informed us of the happy hour specials 2 mins after the happy hour had ended.we might have gotten the deal if she had even acknowledged our table for the first 10 mins that we were sitting there! nSeriously this place is NOT the bizz,1
"This is not the best Pho place I've ever eaten at, but it is the best in the Valley! I had two slightly different experiences. The first, I found the Pho under seasoned and too lightly flavored. The second, the Pho was perfectly concentrated and seasoned and really tasted delicious. I would go back and give it another try!",2
"This place left me with a really good first impression. The burgers are the bomb! The patties are juicy with a well seasoned flavor and have this nice crisp around the edges. The interior is clean with large booths and ample seating. Much nicer ambience than your run of the mill fastfood joint. The custard was good but not the best I've had. Nevertheless, it's a nice finish to the meal.",2
"I had the worst experience at this oreganos. Selma, the hostess, was one of the rudest people I have ever encountered at a restaurant. When we arrived at oreganos, we were told that it was a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night. Her attitude made us not consider waiting for our table and move on to a restaurant that appreciates their customers. Selma, thanks for nothing!",1
"This pizza totally sucks. If you have no choice and want to eat pizza, you probably won't be satisfied when you leave. Super greasy and the crust is paper thin, but not crispy? You might as well grab a fork and dive in because you cant pick up this floppy slice of pie. I hate to write a negative review, but you deserve to know what you're walking into.",1
I asked for light mustard and Delvin over did it. I asked him to take some of it off and he looked at it like how? I just told him take of the first layer and he did with his glove n it got messy. Then he stick his hands in the ingredient with the same glove full of mustard. Smh! Then he tells me i have to ask for light mustard i said excuse me? Yes I did you didn't hear me.,1
"You know those delicious hole in the wall restaurants you just can't keep a secret? Well you've found it. This is the best Mexican food I have ever had, nothing on the menu disappoints. I wish I could keep this spot a locals only place, but it's too good not to share. As others have said, the short rib tacos are great!",2
I'm a fan of this place! Love the especially the Vegan Taco Salad! The baked fries are pretty awesome also and you feel less guilty about eating them. Some of the dessert cakes taste the same even though they are different flavors. But all in all I think this place deserves a try if you want a healthy wholesome and satisfying meal when eating out.,2
"Kona gets four stars because of their stellar haven't heard that word in a while, have you happy hour and for their Las Vegas roll. I know it's not ""real sushi "" and all that other crap but I like it for these two reasons and that's enough. 3 rolls and cheap margaritas make me happy. Well that and we have some stock in Kona kidding! That doesn't influence my opinion in them at all. ",2
"Great place, food is good, but kind of touristy and over glamorized. It comes off to be your Hawaii grill place, but is kind of trendy and upscale that they loose the essence of Kona, HI. I recommend the place, but be prepared for a sophisticated, pricy meal. It's not a ""local "" place to hangout. Reminds me of a ""hard rock caf u00e9 "" type of environment. Again, good place, though. Just pricy.",1
"this place is a disaster. sat at the bar a few nights ago and was not impressed. the bartenders are terrible, no personality and down right rude. they even charged me for someone else's drinks then argued with me when i complained about my bill. this place wont last long especially with all the competition in Town Square.",1
"DO NOT GO HERE! An hour after we returned home my dog started licking his stomach and crying. He had razor burn all over his stomach. When confronted Cindy started yelling and refused a refund even after the vet said it was because of her terrible grooming. I have posted pictures of the burns on my dogs stomach, however Yelp has removed them because they are horrific.",1
"Was looking for something healthy to eat before class and decided to try this place for the first time. Nice relaxed atmosphere, and it was pretty busy at the time, the 7 8 dollar price tag for a sandwich was a tad steep but when I got the sandwich it was HUGE! Good value and good atmosphere, ill be back!",2
"I am always mad at myself after I eat at Texad Roadhouse because I get so carried away with the delicious appetizers that I never leave enough room for my entree or dessert! But it always makes for a satisfying leftover meal the next day Totally delicious food. It's a tradition in my family to go here every time my parents come to visit. Great service, great environment, even better food. A !",2
This is the perfect place for a quick lunch or a nice sit down dinner! Every meal I've had there has been wonderful and the beer selection is fantastic. I seem to recall delicious bloody marys as well. The outdoor seating gives you an awesome view of the capital! And they are dog friendly too for outdoor seating .,2
I came back to this place since I got hooked on a Sample on the way st Star Trek. They got me good. You enter and theres 3 refrigirated Lettus dispeners in the wall! I haven't been this excited since I saw Red wine on TAP. one star 15 for 2 giagantic wraps. more expensive then Subway but worth it I thought. Rosted BEETs! Great.,2
"How does one rate a gas station? Well, I'ma go off strictly the gas price. 2.24 gallon in December of 2014. I felt like I was in a time warp as I've never seen gas prices this low in years! Circle K across the street which is my usual go to for cheap gas was surprisingly 10 cents more. Filled my entire gas tank for about 30 bucks. It was a Christmas miracle.",2
"Talk about an attitude! The server whom i didn't catch a name from since she stood at our table for a nanosecond and disappeared every time asking us but not giving us a chance to talk if we did or did not want something. I am glad the boys only ordered drinks once here, since her attitude was just crazy we decided to leave after they paid for their tabs.",1
"What an experience. When my friends booked this I was hesitant, I thought is was just a gun range where I's get to shoot a gun or two. Boy was I wrong. It was amazing service from beginning to end. I learned about modern and historic guns and got to shoot them all. The staff made it so much for all of us. Totally relaxed in a comfortable setting. I will do this again!",2
"My coworkers and I go here for a nice dinner about once a month and it is our favorite place in Vegas, hands down! The service is incredible, the steaks are amazing and their wine selection is top notch for those that wish to drink . Things to try chilled seafood appetizer, filet, Caesar salad prepared table side , filet and lobster, and the creme br u00fbl u00e9e.",2
"Travaillant tard, je me retrouve souvent u00e0 ce resto pass u00e9 22h avec des amis ou mon copain. Le service est toujours agr u00e9able et juste assez pr u00e9sent je d u00e9teste me faire demander u00e0 plusieurs reprises si tout est u00e0 mon go u00fbt et les pizza r u00e9pondent tr u00e8s bien aux d u00e9sirs de mon estomac.",2
"It's a great church, Protestant evangelical. Good messages and comfortable to be there. Great coffee shop in house, yes you can bring it in with you. Excellent programs for your kids. 2 services Sunday am. Music is pretty contemporary wish they'd add some country or more familiar music as a part of the service, though.",2
This review is solely based on their market section. This place has a legitimate halal butcher shop section. This is hard to come by in this city. The meats are tasty if you want better ground beef let them grind you a piece of meat. They are friendly and work hard.I am so happy I found them. I wish they had better selection of rice and the produce section was better marked. Overall pretty good,2
"Serves expired food 2 stars. I mean come on, the date and time are printed on the package Expecting something to be wrong every time I go there 1 star. I'm feeling generous today In reality I have more good than bad experiences here, but the bad ones like expired food, cold food and rude employees are big. Why do I keep going here you ask? Cuz it's cheap, 24hrs. and practically at my front door.",1
Came in a Saturday for brunch Pros Close by to where I live. Food isn't terrible. Cons Service is very slow. The prices are to high for the quality and quantity of food. Too many cooks in the kitchen that seemed lost and it took forever to get anything out. Had to ask the waitress for my check several times.,1
This is without a doubt the nicest Harris Teeter I've ever been in. The produce section is pretty large and the wine selection is huge. There's always plenty of cashier lanes open to keep the lines down and even when there is a line I don't mind waiting because I was able to find what I was looking for and more.,2
"Worst costumer service in the world! I've been there 4 times and it's always the same shit! I get there, then 4 people walk in behind me and they get attended first. Then I'm stuck waiting there for 2 hours. I live less then a mile from this location. Now I rather drive an extra 6 miles to the next location on a spare tire.",1
"Thought we'd give Zen one last chance. It sucked. Ambiance is nice and the servers are great. The food is just plain below average. 120 for three people to have a lousy meal is not my idea of a good time. We used to love this place about 10 years ago. Since then it continues to slide. The sushi is uninspired and not fresh. Sorry folks, we won't be back again.",1
The menu board is hard to read. The wings are sold by the pound. They don't include carrots and celery or ranch or blue cheese. Those are extra . They are big pieces but I didn't enjoy the flavor. My husband didn't like them either. I was hungry so I ate several but woke up in the middle of the night and got sick.,1
"Lustige Kneipe und Restaurant in der N u00e4he vom Euro. Ganz nett, um mal mit Freunden ein Bier und u00f6der K u00f6lsch zu zischen. Das Publikum ist bunt gemischt und hier sollte eigentlich jeder auf seine Kosten kommen. Im Sommer bewirtschaftet das Dom das Sommercaf u00e9 an der Karlsburg in Durlach.",2
This place sucked. They put us in a room next to the elevator shaft so all night you hear the elevator go up and down. When you gamble no servers around for drinks. The rock concert was good. The sales people for the time share bombard you right when your trying to get to your elevator which is annoying. Won't be stating there again.,1
"Wish I could rate 6 stars! nMy wife and I eat out a lot, but rarely at a place of this caliber. The food is very expensive our bill with a few drinks was 500 for two but the quality, creativity and service is worth it. nThe staff was extremely attentive and classy without being pretentious or judgmental of bumpkins like us. nI would spend the money again.",2
"Service at this restaurant was excellent. Always asked to refill drinks and offered to take away plates often. When seated, immediately asked for what drinks we wanted. Food at this buffet was on the low quality side, Sushi had a lot of fillers. Food was average to poor. Ice cream was all messy, melted and not very clean. nBeware of the coupons, although you save, the food is very cheaply made.",1
"Don't bother coming to this location. First, they have completely changed the menu. They don't carry shrimp or scallops any longer. But the manager feels pork is a good substitute. Also, they are out of sausage at 7pm on Friday with a 1 2 empty restaurant. According to the manager, ""they were just busy "" though. And to top it off, the manager is an argumentative ass when asked about it! IJS",1
"These people are awesome! I've had a couple issues with my bike flat tire, bent tire frame and they took care of it completely. I never had to pick up a tool or my bike. They took care of my flat in less than 10 minutes, put a new tire in in less than 30. Don't go to a regular retail store these people are the best and the nicest.",2
"Fucking GREAT pizza! This place rivals Cibo for my favorite pizza in town. I had a cheese and peperoni pie. The peperoni was spicy but not over riding so. That sauce was very fruity, the crust perfectly crispy yet soft and flexible. Wow. The restaurant is very small and tucked into a dirty little strip mall but the inside is nice. If you love pizza I think you'll LOVE this place. YUM!",2
"Awesome pharmacy in downtown Madison. They have an amazing selection of natural personal care products at very reasonable prices, plus many testers. It's like being in a candy store. Speaking of candy, there is actually a shelf of Vosges, Gail Ambrosius, and Lake Champlain chocolates. The service is great, too. What's not to love?",2
"I've always been a fan of XXI Forever. But I think you'd be better off buying the stuff online. I have absolutely zero idea how they organized their store. The one on University is smaller than the one near Guy, so it's even more frustrating trying to locate a piece of clothing you saw online. And the staffs are always busy, so you can't really ask them for help.",2
"We got a sandwich about an hour ago and couldn't even eat it, it was horrible. The bread tasted like it was a week old. It literally broke apart, it was so stale. I called and spoke to Dawn who could have cared less. She never even said she was sorry. She said the manager was not there and all she said when I told her how bad the bread was. Oh ! Very poor customer service.",1
"Great environment and great people. Carl and Natalie are professional and knowledgeable about their products. I tried their weekly special ""Breakfast in Bed "" and for me it is like a sweet vanilla maple desert flavor. I also like how you can choose your VG PG ratio which a lot of other shops don't offer. If you are in the area I would definitely check them out.",2
"It's okay. Nothing special. I order the chicken Hibatchi large. It's a big portion probably would have wanted the regular size but wasn't given the option when I places the pick up order. The food was at first good but after awhile it was extremely salty even the vegetables. I wouldn't crave this place, still on the hunt for good Hibatchi.",1
Fantastic view of the strip from the Mandarin Oriental. Expensive drinks. It's a fancy place. My co workers stopped by for a little bit after dinner. We split a 65 bottle of wine and snacked on some bar nuts. I really loved the ambiance since it was loungey and not too busy. It's a really great place for a romantic date and our bartender was really nice too.,2
"We were in a party of six, made reservations a few days in advance, for lunch on Sunday. We were seated promptly and our waitress was cheerful and attentive. Great selection of menu choices as well as drinks. I had the huevos rancheros which included chicken. My wife had the fish tacos. The monkey bread was a good starter. Adjacent to the pool, it's a bright and airy spot.",2
"This place is beautiful. Great views of the valley and hills, green grass and a well lit seating area. We had plenty of room to spread out and mingle. The only problems I had with the park was the Cockroaches that come out at night. There were many and they were all over the place. But, this park is welcoming and safe.",2
"Love the room, not big but very comfortable. Clean hotel, fancy caf u00e9, easy access to monorail. Nice customer service and daily room cleaning. Not a fan of their buffet. Must return in future. I didn't know there are more restaurants. Not exciting about casino floor, it's casual as other hotels. Hotel location is one of the best place on strip, very private.",2
"Not the BEST sushi I've ever had, but for an ALL YOU CAN EAT place I'll give it up! For 20 bucks you can order whole and half rolls, practically everything on the menu is up for grabs. This place is great for groups. Me and 10 of my good friends had a blast trying all the rolls they had to offer. Great time. We walked out of there very full and very happy. What's not to like!?!",2
I love Pinches Tacos. It's a little pricier than most taco places out here and it's out of my way. But if I'm ever downtown which is pretty often these days this is always my go to place. I can't come here without getting an elotes. It's my favorite. The lengua and el pastor are always my choice of tacos. Both flavorful and tender.,2
"I've experienced horrible service here too, like other reviews below. I happened to meet the owner today, who is a complete jerk. No idea how this place can remain in business. For exceptional italian food, Riazzis down the street is 10 times better, if you're looking for pizza, Classic Italian Pizza is also down the street, and makes this place look like the taco bell of italian!",1
"Had a mountain bike frame coated here. The quality of work is second to none, and was completed within a very reasonable timeframe. The cost was also very reasonable a bargain when you consider the quality. I would recommend Snail Motorsports to anyone who wants something powder coated, and will definitely be a return customer.",2
"There was time in my life that I was at Keegan's at least once or twice a week don't judge me! and here's the scoop on what you should order Sliders and a Stella. They have prime rib sliders, with a zesty horse radish Dijon mix that's outstanding. Look at the menu board, but Thursday nights should be Yankee Pot Roast night. Potato Skins. Big plate and good enough to share.",2
"I'm surprised that there are only 2 reviews for this place. nLove the NY style pizza here. Used to get it for lunch at least once a week when I lived in Charlotte 07 08 . And on really rough work days, I would get two slices don't judge me . nThe guys that work there are really down to earth nice. Always remembered my name and order.",2
"My family and I were looking for places to eat, while in Vegas, and we came upon this buffet. We thought we'd try it out since it was an all you can eat buffet for 9.99. I thought, coming into this buffet, the food would be good. It was alright. The food was salty, and some were even cold. The service there was friendly, even though you could barely hear what they are asking you.",1
"Don't bother! We went for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and were the only people in the restaurant. We waited a half an hour for salads, another half hour for our food and they brought half of us the wrong meal. The food was not good and it took another hour to get a manager over to the table. I will never go back!",1
"Being from Texas, I've had my share of Whataburger. This one is consistently horrible! Why would anyone want to eat a cold burger or chicken sandwich with less than fresh ingredients and a slice of cold cheese on top? And how about fresh lettuce instead of the old white chunks of iceberg? WAY too many other options out there to eat this crap.",1
"Nothing special. I don't get all the extremely glowing reviews. I found this ""NY "" pizza to be barely edible I didn't even finish the whole pie. nThe crust was dry and bready. The toppings were ok but undermined by the hard, tasteless crust. I still haven't found a better NY pizza than Sicili on Twain, which is 10 times better than Familia, not to mention less expensive.",1
"Dr. Khan has been great! He understood my pain in my lower back and has me on a path of treatment to help. Dr. Khan has a great bedside manner. The office is very busy but, there goal is to help. Also, the office staff are nice as well. I go for my 1st set of injections in 3 weeks. Upon receiving the injections they only helped a little but now they have me on another treatment plan.",2
Absolutely delicious a favorite in Plaza Midwood. If you are on a budget try going during lunch. It is laid back and essentially the same menu. I highly recommend the pimento cheese BLT. I do not recommend the steak sandwich way too greasy and not at the standard that you would expect . The brunch is also a wonderful treat.,2
"I took a package with a preprinted label on it to return to amazon. They took the package, and lost it. They refused to take responsibility for it even after I gave them the package number and asked me repeatedly if maybe I just thought I took it there. I live right down the road so went here out of convenience but never will again!",1
"This is a great place, especially for right before an event at the US Airways Center or another nearby venue. The service has been great both times we were here. The food is delicious. Our favorites are the Zucchini Fritters, the Minestrone Soup, and the Salted Caramel Pudding. Prices were a little more than we expected, but overall this was a great spot for dinner.",2
"Waited about an hour, and I say it was worth it. We did have a party of 7, so it took longer for us to get seated. We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries which were really good, and the fried egg on top was the kicker. I got the Miyagi burger, and a couple other people got the crabby patty. Burgers and service were good. Will definitely come back when we are in vegas again.",2
Meh.it's pretty decent food and all but there is better to be had in this area. The people were fairly friendly but could care less about being very personable and having a conversation. The biggest issue with this place was how disgusting the bathroom was. Made me with I hadn't closed the door behind me! So gross. Hasn't been cleaned in at least a year or two. I can imagine the kitchen!,1
The service was really slow. They were really understaffed. Just to let everyone know the free yelp snack is popcorn or peanuts I cant remember what she said bc neither sounded appetizing. Happy hour prices aren't that great considering the small amount of food u get. We needed almost 3 appetizers each and we are both slim. We won't be back.,1
Was looking for a neighborhood style restaurant and checked this place out. Very friendly staff and attentive. We ordered lunch. Food from the grill was fresh. The other dish was clearly microwaved as half of the food was cold. Frozen vegetables. Not pleasing at all. nPerhaps breakfast would be a better choice.,1
"Mike does amazing work! I elected for ceramic all the way around, with 40 in the doors and 5 in the back section, and had the air blue 80 on the windshield. It turn out amazing and there was no rainbow effect when wearing polarized sunglasses! I can't talk to you about wait times because I left the car there all day. I'm pretty sure I was the first to drop off and last to pick up.",2
"L'endroit a d u00e9j u00e0 u00e9t u00e9 bien et c'est correct pour aller voir des spectacles m u00e9tal. Mais la plupart du temps, l'endroit est une garderie remplie d'enfants de 17 ans avec des fausses cartes. La bi u00e8re eau pas buvable n'est pas ch u00e8re et si vous commandez une vraie bi u00e8re, on va peut u00eatre vous regarder d'un air bizarre.",1
"Another hit for the Upward Projects people. Friendly staff, delicious menu, great space.this place has it all. The patio is beautiful for warm AZ nights, and it's dog friendly too. Check out the pretzel fondue, and the Joe's church potatoes. Bloody Mary bar for weekend brunch is pretty great too. Plus, it's next to Churn for your sweet tooth.",2
"I was devastated when the location on Raintree ""located "" to Camelback. Even though it seems sooo far to drive to this one it's worth my drive at least once a week for lunch. Especially on Wednesdays when it's 2.00 off. They have everything you could ever want between the salad bars, hot bars and deli.",2
Huge disappointment. Gave it so many chances and excuses for it not to suck. But I'm the end it just flat out sucked. Not worth the 30 dollars if you're over the age of 12. I will stick to the Marvel comics movies. We also noticed while standing in an hour line for something that didn't work was the interactive animations were full of lag and looked as someone set up a Xbox 360 kinect to use.,1
"Closed on Monday's? And closed 5 30 to 6 1? Wow. The prices on the menu don't seem that bad. But i still cant get over the fact there closed on Mondays. There is a sign posted ""help wanted "" so if anyone reads this and needs a job check this place out. And tell them to open on Mondays. BOOOOO, if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe.",1
"Nice looking place but it's servers are very consistent with FORGETTING our orders. I can understand if they forgot to put one order in, but multiple times? After ordering dessert, I felt uneasy and regurgitated what I have eaten. It must have been the baked salmon. I'm never coming back here again. If I could give this place a negative star, I would.",1
"So we've gone back several times since our original review. Things seem to have gone downhill. Last time, one of the plates that came out looked, smelled, and tasted like wet hay. Ew! 4 stars seems to be in the range of 1 2 star no heat! Potatoes tasted funky in the yellow curry too. Not too sure what's going on here, but we're on the prowl for a new Thai restaurant.",1
"i'm a HUGE fan of the restaurant and the menu. i've been eating at various locations in Phoenix, Tucson, and other cities. This particular location keeps getting worse with servings and if you ask for an extra scoop you get attitude. Management is nice, but they need to work on their employees and serving ammount. my burrito bowls i've gotten lately are for babies.",1
i really don't understand the popularity of this place. my friend and i came here for lunch and we were underwhelmed. thought the food was subpar and the sangria had bits and pieces of fruit with the edges all brown and gross. the only redeeming attribute was the al fresco dining and the people watching. will not be returning,1
"These guys are great. Yes, they work out of their garage, but they are quick and efficient and they do a great job. When we called around to price out tinting our minivan, they were by far the least expensive almost half of what other places like AZ Hitchman where I did my first car were charging . We were not disappointed. You won't be either.",2
I was here several times years ago and I was excited to go back. Unfortunately they served me a pile of wet mush. The whipped cream was all melted. Even though the soggy crepe did still taste good I couldn't eat any of it because there was hair in it. Disgusted by the lack of effort to serve something decent.,1
"I love Thai food, but this was literally the worst I've ever had. I had the chicken pad Thai, it was totally flavorless. There were no vegetables and hardly any peanuts. It didn't even come with a lime. If you're looking for a cheap lunch then maybe this place is a good idea. But if you're looking for good Thai food, avoid.",1
"Just tried MCN salon for the first time this week and had an amazing experience there. the stylist Jesse sat me down and assessed my hair, and told me her honest opinion about what she thought it needed and the best kind of cut for me. It was perfect! I'm so happy someone finally took the time to actually give my hair a good look and tell me what it needed. I will definitely be going back!",2
"A friend of mine has been talking to me about the Salty Sow for a few months now. What took me so long? The Pork Stew is Fabulous ! My sister took 2 servings home. Our Server,Tony was outstanding! The Wine he suggested, Troublemaker, was perfect! Can't wait to back. Taking my Husband SOON! Thanks to my good friend, Chandler, for introducing me to my new favorite restaurant .",2
Apparently asking for a tostada salad without cheese is to much to ask for. I asked for one without any dairy for a lactose intolerant person in the drive through. The top had no cheese but once they digged into the salad it had cheese. This is the second time this happened at this location. I will not go back to this location.,1
"NYPD delivered food to our hotel for our wedding weekend pool party, and they supplied everything, from the ice and drinks, to food, to utensils and plates. We were so grateful for their awesome customer service. We were fans prior to our catering needs the food is always fresh, the staff is top notch, and their pizza is a little taste of East Coast home for me.",2
"I have severe degenerative arthritis in my hands. After finding out that OSR has a hand specialist on staff I made an appointment. What a difference a professional caring therapist makes. I am pain free for the first time in years and follow the methods taught to keep that way. I have recommended several friends and family members, something I rarely do. Keep up the good work OSR how wonderful.",2
Being carved a slice of scrambled eggs is just wrong. God knows how long these things had been under the heat lamp already but given I visited here at the bright and early time of 9am I can only imagine how much bouncier these beasts were going to get.The rest of the food was pretty greasy and not worth the prices. I'm sad this place doesn't live up to its great name.,1
"Went for lunch on a weekday. It was nearly empty, which is to be expected in that area at that time, I guess although Le Thai always fills up for lunch . We had the Las Vegas pizza and some garlic potato chips. Both were just copmletely mediocre. I can't slam them for being bad.but I can't say they were good either. I can't think of a single reason to go back.",1
They now charge items by the pound. practically a rummage sale. yes. fill your cart up with whatever. you want they put it on the scale for .99cents a pound.items such as books furniture electronics are at a flat rate. nmy mom ALWAYS goes here comes back with at least 5 full bags. nThey put everything in bins you have to rummage thru everything. nBooks are .25cents which is why I will go back.,1
"Really can't go wrong with a Courtyard. Rooms as always set perfectly for after hours business and beds a comfortable. This property in particular is close to some very good restaurants, which made it easy to entertain and then slide back to the room. Close to PHX, it's a breeze to get to from and on your way. Great location and consistent.",2
"My husband and I live over by the store and always see it on our way home. One night when we couldn't get chocolate ice cream from Dairy Queen we decided why not lets try this place. I am so glad we did! That was the BEST rocky road ice cream I have ever had! Customer service was great, and prices were similer to those of coldstone. We will definatly be going back.",2
"DO NOT ENTER! This place is dirty and stiffs the musicians that play there. If you want to visit a dive bar the best one in the valley is The Dirty Goat Saloon on S. Country Club just before US 60. Rated by Phoenix New Times as ""The Best Day Drinking Dive Bar "" and ""Best Open Mike "". They know how to treat musicians they have a great stage, sound, and lights, and the help is AWESOME!",1
"Me and my wife had been searching for a puppy for a while until we came across the puppy boutique. They were very professional and the puppies seemed to be taken care of. Though EXPENSIVE, two financing options are available. We could not be happier with out puppy. They have a better variety of puppies than the other pounds, shelters, stores, etc, in the area.",2
"If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Vegas Strip, this is the place. My employer's travel agency recommended this hotel, and I feel very lucky. Why? This place has phenomenal service, very clean, modern, and anything you can think of, they have covered. Plus, I ran into Hulk Hogan at the pool!",2
They provided a wonderful experience for my partner and I with their couple's massage. It was so relaxing and peaceful. The quality of the massage was worth every penny. I highly recommend them and plan to purchase as gifts for my family. So many massage places are a hot or miss but this one comes through brilliantly.,2
"Avoid at all costs. I'm a disabled veteran and have stopped here a few times after shopping at the commissary. 2 outta 3 times I felt like my insides were clawing their way out a few hours after eating their food. Someone is either dirty handling the food during the day, or not preparing it properly. Either way, I will not be returning again. Yikes.",1
"i have lived her for a week and have not had a good experence. we have had cockaroaches, the ice maker breaking, we are unable yo use our alram system, and the managment is not up to par. the appointments we set up through managment have all been late, i get nothing but attitude from maria front desk .i really regret moving into this place.",1
"Arrived with out of town guests and found restaurant not planning to open until 4 PM. Contrary to their published hours. No signs, only advised by employee sweeping off patio. Had checked their website before leaving home 45 miles away and no notice on site. 4 year old grand daughter named Alice was so upset as she wanted to see ""a boy named Alice "". Will never return!",1
"Probably some of the best pizza you'll ever have, and they cater to both thin and thick crust aficionados alike! Toppings are plentiful and yummy! There are other locations, but this location is the bet IMHO. Total throwback to the 80s, it's great! Service is always exceptional, efficient and extraordinarily friendly especially Ann, who's been there something like 25 years! .",2
"Zucca chips are great. Had two orders! The service was a good however it took a long time to get our food. It was a Saturday night and packed. Still a good time and great food. Had the spaghetti and meatballs. Also tried the chicken parm, was very good. The pasta was great and the drinks were stiff.",2
"I have only had take out while at work from here. I would never go there to eat. What is the deal with the giant bread? I caever order anything hot because it won't be when I get it. I kow a lot of people like it and maybe it is what they order and what I order, but I just have NEVER liked anything I have gotten from this place!",1
Lovely Hotel Casino a few miles away from the main strip. Nice rooms and super friendly staff which makes the atmosphere so much better. Has bowling available if your in the mood. which I did So many good things to say about this place. I'd have a lot more to say about this place if I wasn't so wasted and could remember everything. All I remember is basically what I mentioned.,2
Fantastic food! Our table of four all shared no one was disappointed. Server was excellent additional staff joked around with us. Great atmosphere. Price was what we expected on the Strip. If you want cheap McDonald's is nearby so don't complain about price. You get what you pay for. Will definitely come back. BTW the Mac Cheese Burger was out of the world!,2
"Brought our Girl Scout troop to Denise for some hands on cooking lessons and she is hands down the best! Not only is she extremely knowledgeable in the culinary field, she is also very inviting and engaging. She is creative and provides an outside the box experience. I highly recommend Denise to anyone whose looking to gain culinary expertise and experience and have fun at the same time.",2
Husband ordered Mongolian Beef and I ordered Kung Pao Chicken. I tasted the Mongolian Beef and could not even mange to swallow it. Horrible flavor and texture. My Kung Pao Chicken was even worse. The rubbery texture was horrible and the watery sauce was unidentifiable. I will say that management was kind enough not to charge us. We left after having taken only 1 bite each.,1
"This place gets two stars for service and maybe three stars for food. The food was alright, but the waiter spilled two glasses of ice water on my friend at the end of the table. Accidentally mixed up two others for two other friends and I found some blonde hairs in my food . ? I think in general service was terrible but the food was alright. That's as much as I can really say about the place.",1
"Amazing Korean BBQ as well as entrees. The sides are always nice and are changed different all the time. Everything is fresh and prepared nice. Friendly staff and the customer service is great. They do have a ""white "" broth for soups which I find funny since I am not Korean. All and all it is my FAV spot in Chinatown for Korean BBQ.",2
"The sign says voted the greatest sandwich in America. I thought it was one of the worst I have ever had. I didn't care for it the first time but thought I would give it a second chance. That was a mistake. Just an ordinary sandwich, nothing special. I have been to dives that can make a better sandwich that that.",1
"The food here was amazing! nI can honestly say that this was the best meal I've had from a restaurant, ever! We were here for a reception meal for a wedding served Caesar salad, shrimp appetizer, filet mignon my son had the chicken, also amazing , and a dessert have no idea what it was but it was good . I don't come to Vegas frequently but would definitely recommend coming here!",2
"Pretty Awesome place! nIt's very difficult to hide the label FAST FOOD, but i think chic fil a does a pretty good job trying. The place is always clean and the service is really nice by everyone working there. I don't really go to places like this, but this was a warm welcome! Go here if you want a ""healthier "" alternative to most fast food places while not giving up taste, quality, and service",2
Delicious desserts! I've never eaten anything but the ice cream desserts but it's a nice treat on a hot Summer day. The vintage decor is really fun and interesting to view while you wait also. The wait staff has always been friendly and the place always seems pretty busy. My boyfriend has been going here since it has opened and we will continue to do so. The pricing isn't too bad either.,2
"Not a fan of this airport. Gates are such a long walk from the baggage claim, and it takes FOREVER to get your luggage yes, one day I will learn to not check my bags . Decent food options, but not great. I think I'm just spoiled because I get to fly out the best airport in the country all the time.PDX. Sorry, PHX, not looking forward to our next meeting.",1
"Sadly, the service has slipped. Not enough help to wait on the customers. Wait staff was waiting tables, serving as cashiers and bussing tables. Slow to get drink refills, didn't offer to bring more chips. Food wasn't hot either. The place was a huge disappointment on our visit this week. We are not likely to return.",1
"This was our second visit to the show, and we enjoyed more this time. After the first show, we thought we figured some of his tricks out, but after paying more close attention to it this time, we decided that we do not know how he does that trick. nWe went with our adult children and they had the great time.",2
"i will never order from here again, the food has always been pretty good but waiting for 2 hours for it? deffinately not worth it, especially when they call me and tell me that they are leaving in 10 min and dont show up for another hour. and they are ALWAYS out of soft shell crab. yea deffinately wont be back",1
"Started my weekend birthday celebration at Akahana. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised, as it was our first time with the new management. The decor is very appealing. My only suggestion would be to reevaluate your music selection. Akahana is such an swanky, trendy spot, the last thing you expect to hear is 80's music.",2
"One of the worst asian Restaurants The service was Horrible and extremely Rude, when we ordered it was like we were bothering them asking a question. How do you screw up your owationality food? Waited about 7 10 mins. With two empty glasses of water with only two other tables with customers in Restaurant. SAd!",1
This store sucks! They have been out of sting and linger BBQ sauce for like 3 4 weeks and whenever I ask when they'll get nIt io one knows. The organization of his store makes no sense and it's hard to find things. Employees seem to be a little clueless where things are and work at a snails pace. The AJs on Thompson Peak Pkwy is way better. At least they have things in stock!,1
"I came here twice and only to eat at one of the restaurants. The place is gorgeous, modern and clean. Very well decorated and it has a nice smell when you go in. Tons of bars and restaurants and a very open casino floor. It's about 10 min south of the strip, so definitely not too far to stay at. The pool area and pool looks amazing. Has a very young crowd feel.",2
"I purchased a Groupon for an oil change but after upgrading to Synthetic oil I ended paying 94 in top of the 15.00 for the original oil change. Honesty? I didn't get it at this location. No Savings at all, you will be scam is no way out. You will see it. Also they give a price 239 for rear brakes pad but they did not get me here, I got it done for 89.00.",1
"What you've heard is true! Amazing salads and pizzas. The staff seems so happy to work there and be hands on. They take great pride in the food themselves . Loved that I could build my own pizza with dozens of topping choices, including the meats and cheeses ! This is the place for me! I love different types of salami, chicken and sausages.there's no ""typical "" only offered here! Delicious ",2
"If you're looking to enjoy a huge burrito, this is the place to go. Although when I went, the ""burrito artist "" was giving me a hard time due to the fact that I was having a hard time ordering. Since I haven't had Chipotle for quite some time, I was overwhelmed by all the options. But it was worthwhile because the burrito was superb!",2
"seriously? i mean, really and truly? if you live in madison and you think the olive garden is good food, either you were born without taste buds or you had them surgically removed as a child. there is no excuse for the olive garden or applebee's or the like in a town like this. eating there should be criminal.",1
"NOT impressed. The company talks a good game about being community and family friendly. NOT TRUE. Have not even tried the food here thanks to their rude staff and arrogant posturing that they are better than others. Don't know about the other locations, but this one on Happy Valley is one I will not be giving any money to.",1
"I love this mall.it's definitely one of my favorite malls on the West Coast. They have everything from everyday shopping to high end names. They even have every single department store you can think of. You got it Macy's, Bloomingdales Home , Nordstroms, Saks 5th Neiman Marcus! Can you name any other mall with all 5? They also have free shows.check schedule times!",2
"4 stars for Thursday wing special. Honestly, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that these may be the best wings I have ever had. And guess what, they are only 5 all day every thursday! Now let me explain my perfect wing I like them smaller, well done and not overly covered in sauce. Spot on here",2
Out of state visitor and by far this is the worst IHOP I have been to. Took 10 minutes til I had to go get the waitress to just get our drinks ordered. Food was decent. The most horrible service ever waitress was rude and got things mixed up a lot. Adding that there was only 4 other parties in the entire restaurant. Just a bad experience.,1
"Wow, this place is a disaster! I think they messed up every single part of our visit from the ordering process to getting our food. It seemed like everyone else had issues too, I don't think I saw one table that didn't have to pull the manager over for an issue. The layout of the restaurant is so convoluted it just manages to make a bad situation worse.",1
"Went for their staff meal last night. nSooooooooo good! nThey had roasted bone marrow sand dabs. We also ordered escargots and the mussels. Everything was without question delectable! nService was above and beyond brilliant. We sat at the bar, Mikey was the bartender and he was just absolutely fabulous! nOne caot go wrong dining here!",2
It's your only option for a latte at the Dane County Airport. It's inconsistent but it is possible to get a decent latte. They are better with iced lattes as they tend to over foam hot lattes. Note all lattes are made with 2 shots. So if you want a strong latte you will need to order extra shots for larger drinks. This can get a bit pricey. The smallest latte is 4.10.,1
"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Haus Murphy's. Consistently good food and service. Fun atmosphere and staff. I prefer the goulash, which is rich and meaty. The red cabbage is tasty and sweet. The beers are strong and cold. I often visit with my German adopted grandfather and he converses with one of the waiters fluently and it always has hilarious results.",2
"Main reason to go to Sonora the Kobe burger! By far the best burger in town. I usually go for lunch since its close to my office and have never been disappointed by the food. Great service, great waitstaff, great food. I've been once for dinner and the beer is exceptional. All around a great pick! Even worth the drive from the NW Valley.",2
"While I felt welcome while there, after I left I started receiving ""phantom "" bills. That is, on two occasions, with a zero balance, I received a bill for 100, and then one for 75. I am not sure if it's because I'm a senior citizen or a sucker, but I was told my two insurance policies did not cover those expenses. So, I have 500 eyeglasses, and cannot say anything good about this place.",1
"Again.every single Gelato Spot is amazing! Clean, friendly and inviting and the cases are just beautiful with fresh gelato in any flavor you can imagine. My favorite is still the Cookies Cream.I think I seriously dream about this stuff! If you haven't tried a Gelato Spot yet, get yourself to one quickly.you will not be disappointed!",2
Worst service ever! Walked at 2 28 and they would not even seat our party of 7. 3 different hosts were very rude and explained that they can close whenever they like even though a time of 3pm is shown everywhere for a Friday. Very disappointed at such a waste of time and such rudeness by 3 different members of their staff. As a local I will NOT be coming back ever again!,1
"Do not let the exterior fool you. This place iot about how nice the outside is, it's about how good the food inside is. Food is great and there is lot's of it. Great variety. Friendly servers. Kitchen slow to get food out to you, but it is well worth the wait. Drunken Noodle and Duck soup .off the hook.",2
Frustration! Each and every time we have gone it is a nightmare to check out! They cannot find the account and or credits and or double charge and or didn't' write down the appt. We have over a dozen credits remaining and we are letting them expire because this place is the opposite of relieving stress!,1
"Horrible waitress service. Waited longer than two others who arrives after we ordered and one couple got an order corrected before we decided to leave. Waitress sat on out order. This was late night service. We simply left. They told us not to worry about the drink. They, I think, didn't want us there.",1
"Just read the jonny rocket review dam. Well at 3am and craving fries I had to do something. Got the late night special and well. The burger was meh. The fries were meh, but when your jonesen for fries your in heaveo matter what. If it was day time would I eat here? Hell no. but at least it was not gross.",1
My wife and I are from NY and came here on our 9th anniversary. Best bartenders we have ever seen. They check every glass for imperfections and decant a bit to check for proper flavor before serving to the customers. Our bartender Niko was very professional and friendly. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others. We wish more bartenders took this much pride in their craft.,2
My husband I have been coming to this Village Inn since 2008. We really enjoyed it. The food there is excellent I normally eat their breakfast meals and the service is good. I love the new look they have now. They remodelled the inside of the restaurant since last year. It looks fantastic. I love the new colors too. Great place.,2
"Usually buffets start out sparkling clean, and serving only the finest food. Smiling chefs, and pristine service usually declines after a year or so. This place just opened, and the food is already stale and bland. Sushi chef dogging you every time you walk by. Dirty floor and tables. They gave up from the start.",1
"DON'T COME IN FOR LUNCH! Came in on our lunch break because we work around the corner. After waiting 10 minutes for drinks. We finally got our order in and food didn't come for another 30 minutes. 45 minutes later, the manager tells us to call ahead next time. They did discount our meal but that was after I complained to the manager, who told us to call in ahead of time.",1
"My iPhone wouldn't charge after buying a new cord. I was calling around town and these guys gave me the best price. Headed over to Tempe Marketplace and the guy told me it was going to take about 20 mins.Did one loop around the place and 10 mins later.It was done! Good as new! Great price, Quick, I definitely recommend this place if you need a repair for your phone!",2
"Didn't meet my expectations. When I go to a resort, I anticipate excellent customer service and something more than a typical hotel stay. The rooms were good size and clean, but my room was not serviced on my second day stay and I certainly did not feel catered to while at the pool. Bartender by the pool was rude. Breakfast is also not included or even offered so you must go offsite for breakfast.",1
"I was so excited to take my mother in law to Firefly for her 70th birthday, but the restaurant does not take reservations for parties smaller than 10 people on the weekends. I generally don't ask for, or expect, special treatment, but I was so disappointed when they wouldn't make this small concession after saying the wait could be as long as an hour.",1
"Food was ok. Some dishes were good. And some were dry like it was sitting there for awhile. Some food was bland, no flavoring. There were good dishes but hard to find. Desserts were store bought or out of a can. nThey make the sushi fresh but looks like its been sitting there for awhile. nOverall not worth 25.",1
"Good overall. Only went for color safe shampoo and conditioner, but they have a good variety of hair care products for every type of hair including treatments for damaged hair and for ppl who spend a lot of time in the pool. nNot a huge store but it appeared to have a good selection in general. nStaff very polite asked if I needed help but didn't hover when I said no.",2
Definitely the place to go for breakfast when in Vegas. Portion sizes are huge. Shared the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and still we had left overs. We both ordered OJ and we could have shared those as well. Biscuits with the meal were really good as well as the crust on the chicken! Based on other reviews will have to go back and try the chicken and waffles.,2
"They said shirts would be 2.50 at drop off. At pick up it was 5.00! Lady said it was because they were long sleeve shirts. Hmm. Anyway, spots were still on shirts but they agreed to redo them. Went to pick up 2nd trip and another customer was freaking out. They lost the pants to his suit and he had to be at an event in a couple hours. Not good.",1
"I used to love smashburger. And I mean REALLY loved it. but today, I went, and my burger was dry. which is weird. and then, I found a HAIR in my meat. ugh. I had ate most the burger so when I called the manager over he offered to remake it but I didn't want to waste it, so he gave me more fries and a 5 gift certificate. I will probably give it to a coworker. I just cant do smashburger anymore. ",1
"This is the best restaurant in Las Vegas. Amazing vegetarian options, and a really chill vibe. Free foosball. Killer ambiance. Cheap. Tacos for 1.75, drinks 5.75 The food was AMAZING. Jonathan, a server here, is the best. He'll help you pick your food, he understands cilantro allergies and best of all his tequila recommendations are out of this world!",2
This was a delivery 1st time and last time . almost 40 dollars and I ordered a burger medium well and I got it rare with it cold on the center I had to nuke it to cook it . fries they were good but the portion was small . the burger tasted plaio flavour. Not impressed esp for the price not worth it !,1
"This place is NOT 5 star place. There are better places. Also, they do NOT give you the 1 free massage upon 5 unless you pay 100 at once, and you can only use it on the next day. So buy the 100 card one day before you want to get a massage otherwise they don't count that first massage you got. P.S They don't speak English. Only Chinese. JFYI",1
This is a regular go to for me. I love the food and the service. They always have the wine that I like and the food is always delicious. I suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store in the section where you can buy stuff to take home . It is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness.,2
"great idea but this place won't last. way overpriced, ridiculously small portions and not enough tables for their diners. You're telling me I just spent 40 and there's nowhere to sit to eat it? It's gimmicky and I've been to similar places that are much better all around see my review for Slapfish . lobster me once, shame on me, sorry, don't lobster me again peeps",1
"Try the Watermelon Agua Fresca, vodka and vanilla mint syrup. What a cool refreshment on a hot phoenix day. AND its only 5.00. Our waitress was attentive and helpful. And the brown bag chicken sandwich was yummy. Really wanted to try a side of mac n cheese, but opted for the chopped kale salad. What a nice surprise. Healthy and tasty.",2
"stayed there for business conference. the hotel was great, neat cleaew spacious. a huge hotel pool is always a plus in the land of Vegas. I enjoyed my stay there very much. Although it is towards end of the strip, it's really not bad of commute if you are going out. all the neighbor hotels are somewhat inter connected. you just need to find the way",2
"This was one of the few spots that I actually enjoyed in the whole city. We went here for late night drinks and they were serving up free sushi and fried won ton. On top of that, the large Sapporo sake bombs only cost 6! I haven't had the food outside of the free stuff, but my co worker tells me that you never eat raw sushi in Phoenix because it can't be fresh in the middle of the desert.",2
"BURGERS AND FROZEN CUSTARD YES! Lance, the owner, knows how to 'create' a great place. Really friendly, and ""neighborhoody ""! I've tried their standard beef burger very high grade , turkey burger, and the most awesome of them all.veggie burgers! Great fries, and all.and top it off with good ol' southern style frozen custard and this place is a winner.",2
"the Pharmacist is rude! I asked him to help me with a supplement selection and he made it seem like I was a HUGE bother and told me to ask someone else. Also, my doctor called in a script and the pharmacist declared that he never did and again was extremely rude. He acts as if he is too busy to be polite and doesn't have any customer courtesy. The rest of the staff is usually helpful and kind.",1
"Holy crap this place is good! We randomly stopped by this place today and wow, was it a great choice! I had the appetizer pork shoulder tostada YUM and the shepards beanie pie delicious . My companion had the scallops scallops can either totally suck or be delicious.they were delicious, perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. GO HERE NOW!",2
"TERRIBLE customer service. It took them an hour to get us seated even after we made a reservation three days ago, AND we had a big party of people. It took them forever to take our order even after they take an hour just to seat us. The food was alright although the chicken tasted like rubber. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1
Was told to be here for a drug screening mandated by work at noon. I get here at noon and they tell me I'm looking at a 45 minute wait. Receptionist seems very unfamiliar with her position. Very very frustrating experience. finally seen after over an hour wait. Nurse was nice but I hope I never have to come here again.,1
"This has to be one of the most consistent restaurants in the west valley regarding the quality of the food and service. I have tried the ribs at Texas Roadhouse, Mimis, Dillons and Outback. Although they are good at all of the above, they fall off the bone at Outback and are noticeably better than the other restaurants. Have noticed all of their meals are consistent in quality.",2
"Do you believe in the hereafter? nWell not anymore. nBecause whatever it is you came hereafter, you're not going to find it. Why? nThis is the Denny's of Mexican Food. nLook around. nNotice anything? nLike how there's no Mexican's anywhere in sight? nThat's never a good sign. Folks, when you can't even get a Mexican to eat here, you might as well be selling roadkill.",1
This is the greatest idea ever! It's about 15 to take the indoor gondola it was too cold to go outside at the time but it takes you from one end of the river all the way to the other which ends up close to the Palazzo Hotel . You get a singing and friendly gondolier and also beautiful imitations of Venezia on either side as you slowly cruise by. Definitely worth it and so cute!,2
"i went here for lunch last week,after reviewing the menu i decided on the meatloaf sandwich may be i didnt read the discription but what i got was a open face sandwich the piece of loaf wasnt big enough to cover the bread and was a thin piece as well. the price was stiff for the portion served. beer selection fair service decent. i may return to try wings but at this point not high on my list",1
"I just moved from there after a year of bs, First and foremost the management is abunch of lying crooks who steal from the residents and charge late fees and keep the money, the complex grills never worked. they have a bug problem. i met alot of people in the complex they all had bug issues, do not move in there you will regret it.",1
"A very nice couple was working. No, they don't speak much English but you can tell they are learning. Plus the food was very authentic and the menu was varied. It's not in a pretty spot but it's clean. I couldn't find the hours or phone number so I just posted a pic with the back of their menu with that info.",2
"The waitress was great, the food was ok, and the hostess was terrible! The manager and hostess sat 2 groups ahead of us that came in after us! The manager gave an excuse that she can't sit too many people at once in one section. There were only 2 in our party! No true apology nor did they offer to make up the inconvenience. I would never go back!",1
"Had 2 rooms of carpet and tile cleaned. I also had them clean my dryer vent. The carpet looks brand new and the tile looks like the day it was installed! They were on time, very professional and did a great job. There was no chemical smell and everything dried in a few hours. I plan to use them again to get my air ducts cleaned, and the rest of the carpets done.",2
Great burger and friendly people. There is a good sized deck that lets you take your time and enjoy lunch before having to go back to work. The fires tots combination is a great fit. The only thing I won't try is the 40 20. 40 ounces of hamburger in 20 minutes in order to get your picture on their wall. Good job BT!,2
"So happy to walk into Active Body and not get the snobby sales people! They have a nice selection of active wear, as well as nice jeans, tops, and dresses. I usually pick up a few pair of Twisted Heart flip flops once or twice a year, and stop in often just to browse. Pricey, like you would expect, but worth it for the nice service.",2
"Rita Rudner was classic. I went about a week ago not knowing what to expect. She ended up charming the pants off the audience with her personality and story telling. She kept it mainly pg, but you could tell she had some r rated stuff in her arsenal. Although i didn't pee my pants, i was laughing throughout the whole show.",2
"Music was alot more Techno Circuit music than House. Staff was fine got in easily signed up for guest list in advance . Way too many uncool Asians no one giving any kind of fashion or cool funky vibe.maybe I am a underground deep house snob. Seemed like for most people there it was one of their first times at a ""non mainstream club """,1
"We usually eat here once a week. We've enjoyed the food that much. However, I'm hoping last Friday night was a fluke and not a sign of things to come. The corn on the cob was terribly over cooked and inedible and the wings were half the size that they've been in the past. We're really hoping it was just an off night.",2
"Ok, I am not gonna go overboard and say that it is some of the best pizza I have ever had.C'mon I live in Montreal. But, that being said, it is some tasty pizza. They are well priced and the pizza is far from being bad In fact, ask for sesame seeds on the crust and you will be pleasantly surprised. Definitely, a fair pizza for a fair price!",2
"Went in today not realizing that they had changed name and owners. NEW NAME IS HAPPY WOK. Ordered Won Ton Soup and all it was was broth, house fried rice and the house chow fun and NO flavor. The new people were not as friendly and the son ? acts like he isn't allowed out in public very often. Pretty awkward ordering experince. Off to find a new neighborhood Chinese spot",1
"It's obviously not the best pizza in the Valley, but it just may be the best bang for your buck. My wife and I cruise over probably every two weeks when we don't want to cook or spend a lot of money. For 5, their regular cheese or pepperoni pizza hits the spot. Fast, simple, cheap, and pretty darn good. Very underrated in my opinion!",2
"Fun, with caps if I did that sort of thing. The whole experience was great you won't get any specifics, this review is 3 weeks after, I can't remember, sorry . Service was by that waitress who does everything perfectly. Explain food, wine, doesn't stay too long. Nice interesting big room decor. Looking forward to the next time.",2
"Awsome service! Wait staff was very friendly! And we were a groupe and it went fairly quickly! Food was fresh and good! portions were just right and the prices were reasonable as well. The ambiance is good, the music was a bit loud, dont think i would go with my parents since they wouldnt be able to hear me, but for me it was fine. Keeping it bookmarked!",2
"This review is for Ana. She was so nice and professional.she was helping me to choose a color for my foundation.i have been to many Mac store by far her customer service was the best I have ever receive.i was there around 9 00pm,she was so friendly,helpful.when I leave a store I was so happy. yesterday was my birthday and she made my day.",2
"I cant believe! I came here with my friends.someone took a lot of our money. Around 1000 .I asked a security what wrong with a door,its locked last night and opened in the morning.he said he didnt know, he had to check everything and let we know if he know something.oh my god.they dont have camera and we cant check .i never come back again.",1
"I ordered 4 pizzas from Pino's for a team holiday party. Pino's answered the phone at 8 45am, took my order, gave me a total and then had the pizzas ready exactly at noon when I asked for them. And the pizza was great! 12 people ate all but 1 pizza and then happily devoured the cold pizza for leftovers the next day! Nice crust, fresh ingredients and good service. I, and my colleagues will be back.",2
I have sat at the bar hear numerous times and have gotten great service. Twice I have been seated at arable and have had terrible service and once told I needed to have at least three in my party to sit at a table. nThe same man and women have provided poor service and were unprofessional both times.,1
One of the top 3 Thai Places in Pittsburgh definitely. Ambience gets 5 stars! However even though the food is GREAT! Its not completely authentic tasting. The Pad Ki Mao with Shrimp was excellent so was the Fried Rice. Helpings are small per person so sharing one entree is not an option. I will be back definately.,2
"So this place has consistently been getting worse each time I've been coming here. Not sure if they plan on getting better. A huge vegetarian alert according to Javier, almost everything is cooked with lard.even the chips. That's sad as the last time I asked he didn't mention that. Service can definitely be improved.",1
"Friendly service, great food, reasonable prices for Montreal. I ordered the risotto from the prix fixe menu and was not disappointed. My husband ordered the chicken scallopini and it was amazing. My daughter ordered the tortellini with butter and cheese, and the helpful waiter suggested a half portion. I would definitely go here again.",2
We came here to get the screen fixed on a phone and it was a great. breath of fresh air the staff was very friendly told us the price and that it would take 2 hours to fix. 2 hours later we received a phone call that the phone was ready to pick up . The phone looked brand new and it comes with a 30 day warranty,2
Went on Saturday and WOW what amazing crepes! Shared an Italy and an Austria and the quality was simply outstanding! Service was great as well. The only negative is the fact that they don't do tap water and charge 1.50 for bottled water. It seems to me that if they were really sorry about that they would charge something closer to cost for people dining there.,2
"Took the shuttle from the Flamingo to the airport. Brian was our driver. When we got on and paid they asked what airline we all were on. We were flying American. Others were flying allegiant, Alaskan, etc. so what did our driver do? Fly right past American. I understand that everybody makes mistakes I still tipped a couple dollars anyway.",1
If you are sent here due to a work related injury do more research. While the staff may seem friendly and helpful. Once 5 pm hits its time to go. Sorry if the work is incomplete we can start again tomorrow. I did not see the regular dentist so I caot speak about him. But in any event it us probably best to steer another direction,1
"Ryan C told me they make a real burger here. Well I had to se for myself. The burger is a hand Pattied Sirloin burger cooked to order over a flame.yep a flame.chared beef, like a burger is supposed to be. It was perfect, the price was right, the building is great, I loved it. I cannot wait to try more food. FYI. it is a chain ohhhhh.",2
"The surprising thing about Vegas is how few great dining options there are late night. Sure, every hotel has its late night restaurant but they're generally pretty average. This place was great! They had funky rolls and good drinks and at 2am we weren't expecting anything this good. Would definitely return.",2
"Every time I come here I think it's going to be up to par with everything else Bellagio has to offer. But, it fails every time. The food is not tasty. Plate after plate I threw away. Hoping for something better next trip to the buffet. It made me feel responsible for world hunger. It made me want to have a word with the chefs about how to season. It made me wish I was at the buffet at Wynn.",1
"I am obsessed with this place. I'm not sure if it's the amazing food, the cool vibe or the history of the Don Bolles incident.or a combination of all three. I love the guacamole and street tacos. The Micheladas are bomb too! I love GB ! My only complaint is the last couple times I've been the wait was over 45 minutes I've been going to GB for years and never had to wait!",2
"Good selection for the lunch buffet. Came by for lunch because I've enjoyed the spread at the Scottsdale location. I wasn't disappointed. Separately, though, admittedly, the place was relatively empty when I visited meaning the wait staff resources weren't overtasked , I wanted to mention that the service I experienced wasn't bad some other reviewers have said otherwise .",2
"The business hours state that they open at 9am it's 9.17am now and they still didn't open. What a joke. Beside that my package was supposed to be dropped off at my house on Thursday which I needed badly for one of my customers, I paid for overnight shipping . It's now Monday and they still don't know where my package is.",1
This used to be one of our favs but time after time the food was mediocre and the wait staff was snooty. We no longer visit Houstons. The ribs and burgers are good and we still haven't found a place that comes close to the spinach dip but I think the wait staff needs some training in common courtesy.,1
Breakfast Overall the experience could have been much better without the lazy lady at the cash register waitress was wonderful but food was just under par But to think about it an simple breakfast without the buffet would have been much better. Please recreate the menu get rid of the lazy cashier. What a horrible way to start a morning.,1
Such a beautiful ambiance! My good friend took me here and since then cannot stop raving about it! I even loved the glass ware! The lead bartender was attentive and easy to talk to. The wine was delicious and the couches were comfy I definitely recommend going with just a couple friends or reserving it out for larger parties. Check it out!,2
"The 2 stars is for the cheap shitty food. Its just another chain place with zero quality food. However, the service is good and friendly. The hostess, waitress and bartender were all really nice and the beer is good. I would say a fun place for drinks only unless you just don't mind eating crap every once in a while.",1
"Bestes RESTAURANT kein klassischer D u00f6nerladen D u00f6nerbude in Karlsruhe. Sehr nette, aufmerksame Bedienung. Das Men u00fc ist von oben bis unten sehr empfehlenswert. nIch bin Stammkunde seit Jahren und bin jedesmal aufs Neue begeistert vom Essen nKenne viele in meiner Umgebung, die wenn sie Essen gehen wollen, nur dieses RESTAURANT aufsuchen.",2
"You need a NY slice, in Vegas, at 2 am? No problem, fuhgeddaboutit, these guys have you covered! Slices are big and relatively cheap for Vegas. Not really any place to sit, but you can stand at the counter and wolf down your slice just don't forget to sprinkle it liberally with hot pepper and Parmesan first! That's the authentic experience.",2
OK. For 80 a night this place works. I'm riding a motorcycle and they said I could park it right out front and I could see it from my room. nI won 100 on roulette which paid for my room and dinner. nBest of all is that this place is totally old school. Big tube TVs and push button phones. It feels like you're in the past. nCool place.,2
"Evanka was GREAT. It was my second time getting a wax, and my first time trying Wax In The City. This wax blew my first out of the water. There was little to no pain and Evanka was nice and chatty and it was such a comfortable environment. And you can't help but love the lacy panties you get on your way out nI'll definitely be going back!",2
Very overpriced and VERY VERY rude. Just left a sale. Wish I would have never spent my hard earned 20 dollars. Will not go back again. They make it feel as if you are a complete burden to them and snicker at you wanting a few dollars off. My total for some used towels a sheet and egg slicer and thermometer was TWENTY THREE dollars! They wouldn't even do 20 dollars. Never ever will I go back,1
THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE! The service is the worst you will get at any Sushi place I've been to. I went for lunch one day and ended waiting over an hour to get my meal and the bill. Our waitress never came back once to refill our sodas or anything. The staff was rude when we reminded them that the bill needed to be split. NEVER AGAIN!,1
todai in vegas is alright. nthey had few speciality rolls that i enjoyed. not much sashimi available nthe best part of dining in todai was making my own hwae dup bap sashimi rice salad when i saw gochujang korean hot pepper paste n i got a bowl of white rice and put salad and sashimi and gochujang all over! i had about 3 bowls and called it a day!,1
"sucked. n This is unfortunate because its extremely close to my house. n But, service sucked delivery person spoke no English to the point he didn't know the phone number to call in and square away the order. n we called back gentleman or lack there of persisted to scream, and hung up phone. Well, my food went back and hungry I still am.",1
"Been here three times and every time was great. The roast beef is top of the line. It was perfectly cooked, with a pink red center, and crispy cooked outside. The crap legs were fresh, and sweet. It is great with a little butter or lemon juice. The soup and Chinese selection is great and the dessert bar is one of a kind. Definitely come here when your in Vegas.",2
I went there after reading the reviews but the place kind of disappointed me. It was dinner time but the place was empty. Only a waiter for the whole restaurant. Service was slow. We ordered lamb and catch of the day. The fish is almost ok if I didn't taste the gallbladder. And the lamb just sucks for we can taste the meat is not fresh. Will never go there again.,1
"This is a decent pre gaming spot if you're staying at TI, but I wouldn't recommend going here if you weren't staying in the hotel. It's a little on the small side but the music and atmosphere make up for it. I would suggest making this a meet up spot since its rarely ever crowded. Keep an eye out for people passing out free drink tickets. You can't beat 2 for 1. Only if necessary.",1
In one word terrible. In summary no idea how they can call themselves a Brazilian steakhouse. Both meat service and waiter service almost non existent. My first clue should have been how empty it was for dinner. Meats were fatty and chewy. They seemed offended if you asked for something out of their serving order. If you have ever been to Fogo or Texas de Brazil you will leave here disappointed.,1
"Came in on a Wed evening and was told there is a 30 45 minute wait. On the left side of the restaurant almost all of the tables were not being used, so I guess they are short staffed and only open half the serving floor. Its also pretty loud in there. I'll try and go back to try the food next week. Hopefully it is a better experience.",1
"This place is a must go to in the Phoenix area if you have a young child. There is a TON to do for the kids on 3 very large levels. nAll of this is 'pretend land'. nIce cream cart ngrocery store warehouse ncar wash nHUGE climbing, exploring structure nair pipes scarves nmany ball related learning mazes and activities nand MUCH more just GO!",2
"If I could give no stars, I would. Lousy lousy service. Don't bother making an appointment, they wont honor it. They are prone to injuring patrons by overeager gouging while trimming nails. The manicures last maybe a day due to their using shit products. Attitude of staff only marginally better. Overall a waste of the gas to drive here.",1
"I really liked this place! Not something you can get in the Burgh. King crab legs, shrimp, potatoes, corn, sausage the best in a bag of Cajun sauce. A bit odd to eat with hands on a table so be sure to wash before you sit. I may go back tomorrow. Definitely made up for last nights buffet disaster on the strip.",2
"Do not go there during the day. The place is dead, the girls are so so. Just not a good place to be during the day. As for nights here, you can't even get seated on a Friday or Saturday. There is a line out the door. There are hundreds of girls but the place itself is small. No walking room. The girls are pushy. Not my first choice by no means.",1
"I've only been to the Wild Thaiger once, but I enjoyed the food and would go again. I went with two friends and we all enjoyed our meals. The vegetarian selection on the menu is limited, but what is available is delicious. The service is friendly and relatively quick it was busy when we were there . Great iced green tea!",2
"5.10.08 This spot is suppose to be the place where the locals come and eat. True? Not sure but whatevers I'm just hungry. Decent prices great portion. Their pancakes and french toast is light and fluffy which is nice. It is satisfying and tasty. Very crowded place. Want good breakfast? Come here. And no its not like norms, dennys or ihop. Its BETTER!",2
"Small as far as Vegas clubs go, but pretty fun. A hip hop soundtrack was a welcome change to the electro at most clubs. We had a table but somehow got booted away. Due to not buying alcohol because of a hidden handle of rum? Perhaps. Do not go on the dancefloor if you are in any way claustrophobic. If quarters were any closer I would probably be pregnant right now.",2
It couldn't get much worse.1t is almost laughable. Server claims that u could not order off regular menu even though we arrived at 10 45. Late might menu kicks in at 11Pm. He gave us water then disappeared for 10 minutes .when we asked to order he told us we could not off regular menu. What an idiot. Where's the manager when u need one?,1
"We bought two of the new Chef's dinners from Fresh Easy and found them almost inedible because of the amount of salt used. 47 ! This not only tastes terrible it's unhealthy. And then there was the amount of sauce dumped on the Chicken Marsala, YUCK! Pass on these meals unless you want to have a heart attack. So disappointing, the commercials were enticing but the food is disgusting. Never again!",1
"Lo meioodles with pork. Too little noodles and lots of pork. Odd. Pork could have been good, but it was barely lukewarm. Came with a little bowl of fish broth on the side. Pretty crowded place. Lots of the people are having soup and congee. I see at least one other reviewer commenting on the lukewarm pork too, so it wasn't just this one time.",1
Never going back. Have 1 car in driveway and they ALWAYS throw it under my car. Customer service is awful. They call with special deals and if you politely decline they treat you like your scum. If you cancel you'll need to add them to your blocked list. Whoever runs their customer service and call center should be fired.,1
"Lunch time and one waiter is always a gamble. Lunch took over an hour and all we had was apps. The chick pea ceviche, lentil cakes and grilled eggplant all had the same over use of one sauce. Plus lentil cakes came out look warm and the ""vindaloo "" sauce tasted just like ""rooster "" sauce. Too many choices in the area, I will not be returning.",1
"Air conditioning stopped working around 3 pm Sunday July 13th. After checking yelp called Legacy around 4 30 pm, was told tech was just finishing a job and would probably be at my home sometime between 6 11 pm, but time frame would be more like 6 6 30. Dave showed up at 6 05, diagnosed problem quickly and within an hour air was back on. Would highly recommend Legacy",2
We were lucky to find this place. The food portions are huge and it tastes great. I ordered lunch and my wife was able to get breakfast. The staff is very attentive and friendly. The drinks never went dry and the food was served hot and fast. If you are in the area I highly recommend stopping in for a bite. I wish there were more stars to give.,2
"I moved away from Pittsburgh, but every time I'm home for a visit I come here for sushi. The food is fresh and delicious, and the service is excellent. Tonight I started with a ginger salad, gyoza, green tea and a First Date Roll. Nowhere I have ever been has an appetizer as good as their spicy tuna.",2
"I have ordered from here many times, service has never been great but food was ok. Until today. I ordered orange chicken which is usually amazing but today there was a problem with it and I called to complain. The lady who took my call was so rude that she even hung up on me. She insisted on picking up the remaining food in order to get a refund. Won't be going back ever again.",1
I came here to fix the shattered screen on my iPhone 5s. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door which set a good tone for me. The price definitely wasn't as bad as I was expecting for a repair. When I get got my phone back it was just like new. I'm very accident prone and have gone through a lot of phones so now I have a regular place to come to instead of having to buy a new phone.,2
This first experience has been fantastic. My brother received a FREE large one topping pizza for his bday. Be sure to come at 4 45 for your pizza from a freshly stoked oven. Perfectly cooked with fresh mozzarella and delicious sauce. The Caesar and caprese salads were a great starter. We'll be returning for the great pie! Don't forget the tiramisu.,2
"Terrible! The food was awful husband had chickeachos which tasted like canned chicken, I had an almost burnt to a crisp burger, fries were cold and soggy. Waitresses hit me on the head several times walking by with trays. Stay away! There's a reason they have discount tickets available all the time! If you're looking for a dine in theater, go to iPic or AMC Esplanade!",1
"OMG! Lets just start with the setting. A beautifully done environment, across from the ratcliffe, in the new Levine Museum. The meal was amazing, from the mint infused unsweet iced tea, to the seared scallops with brussel sprout petals yes i said petals and the 3 little pigs entree, my bestie and i split the 2 entrees. I highly recommend this place. Holla!",2
"I loved the interior and its very relaxing after a long day. The menu has a lot of variety, all great dishes but a little pricey. The mussels were incredible! A series of appetizers and great company made it a great night. It can be busy so make sure you have your reservation and get there a little earlier. You can take a walk around uptown after dinner to work off the wonderful dinner.",2
This is very authentic food. I love different ethnic food and honestly their menu was still a little too authentic for me and from what I got not healthy and not all that good. I ordered a chicken lemongrass bowl. The chicken was in a lot of oil all over the chicken with a plentiful layer at the bottom of the bowl.,1
"I took my car there for front end work. A different shop had recommended work to fix the vibration at over a thousand dollars. Yoshi took a look at it, and repaired the needed work at a fraction of the price. Yoshi is the man and is a good HONEST mechanic. I will take my car there for all needed work from now on.",2
"While the server was knowledgable about their product, the product itself was a disappointment. The beer styles and their flavors leave something to be desired. The blonde lacked flavor and tasted like drinking a Coors Lt. It was not what it was cracked up to be. I would not go back for another visit.",1
"Amazing pizza.hands down, the ""best "" pizza in Phoenix.yes, better than some of the more well known places in town won't mention any names And not only are the ingredients top notch, the pizza oven they use a very expensive import bakes the pizzas in record time.wow! Love this place and my new favorite pizza joint!",2
"This place has a variety of exotic drinks and chocolates but it is kinda pricey. I could have gotten better chocolates at that price elsewhere because theirs taste like Hershey's. The drinks are worth trying but it is not great. I love that they have a nice view from the second storey especially but they DO NOT offer free wi fi. So, I can't study or do research while in there.",1
Server specialists do an excellent job of fixing your computer or help you pick a new one and get it up and running. You can also try out the latest products like the Nano. The only yucks part is that if you're waiting to have something repaired you have to take a number and wait sometimes a very long time. On the upside you can go on one of their computers and check your email while you wait.,2
"Still open under a new name, can't remember what it is. Haven't been there in 30 years. Used to be a place for Indians to drink until they fell down. Lots of 400 pound Indian women looking for a man. Very nasty. Had one beer there and saw a guy get knifed. Never went back. The culture here is so diverse, the liberals must love it. I'm sure the place with a new name is still the same.",1
"Horrible company! Charged me 500 to replace the springs on my door. Which is more than double what it should have been. Installed the wrong springs which cause to much tension on my opener. Their stickers are placed all over my door, and i'm told that they PAY people to do this oew and used homes that are for sale so you will call them first. I wish i had looked them up first!",1
"Our first Vegas buffet was a big disappointment. The food did not have much flavor and what they did have had been sitting out for a very long time. I am an average consumer, no big bank roll, so for 35 a person I was expecting at least fresh. If I liked crab legs I may have gotten more for my money, but they too had been sitting there a long time and I was not even tempted to try them.",1
Yes! Must go! We had our best meal here at MTO on our recent anniversary trip to Vegas. Donna was one of THE BEST servers we have ever had! She made the meal. And of course the food was outstanding. We even got a sandwich to go for our drive home. We happened to be there on MTOs first anniversary.I sincerely wish this establishment all the best!,2
"Don't let the lunch line trailing out the front door discourage you, this is the A team and they get you in and out fast. I would recommend the chicken topping over the other meats and it helps to request a dash of seasoning when you order nachos. Make sure to get to know Steve ""the Legend Maker "". Seriously, his business card says ""Legend Maker "" as his title lol.",2
"Probably one of the worst run and seedy casino hotels. The heydays are long gone. This place needs a soup to nuts renovation and management shakeup. Vegas is dying and no one wants to buy it and current management won't fix it. So, they cater to a low end client, give them nothing because that's all they know. Sad.",1
Came here to play some of the games. This place appears trendy and chic. This place was dimly lit with an array of red lampshades on the light fixtures. Drink service was on point and they were very nice. This place mostly plays house music . Overall a good time even though this casino is smaller than most.,2
"This is a clutch breakfast and brunch place for helicopter parents and their children. The menu selections are varied enough to entice every ""Gimme Generation "" appetite and their babysitters too. Coffee cake is Awesome. Outdoor seating available. Friendly people. Honest coffee. Centralized location. Expect to spend about 18 per person at a minimum and tip well at this restaurant.",2
The food was great except when I was eating the oyster i found a live baby worm in it. So. Grossss! Totally lost my appetite. Plus the service was horrible. I asked the ice cream lady for a mochi. She dropped it on top of the counter but stil decided to put it on my plate instead of getting a new one.,1
"They should rename the Genius Bar to the Halfwit Bar. Seriously they throw Genius around way too liberally. Google yields more helpful information than the simple condescending clowns Scottsdale Quarter is offering up. I love Macs, but don't waste your time at Scottsdale Quarter. They have had to replace two of their 5,000 giant glass doors already because they piss people off so much.",1
"This place has been around forever. I remember going here as a kid. I usually get a Chicago Dog or sliders with cheese. Bob is great! Drawbacks. Parking is a pain, very small parking lot. The place is also a bit small run down. But don't let that stop you from enjoying the best sliders in town! I drive in from Goodyear to eat here, that's how good they are.",2
"Not bad at all! All other places nearby rammed to the gunnels on a Saturday night, this was quiet. I love the recycled stuff, the layout and the decor. We had Macaroni cheese for me and cottage pie for him. Microwaved but not to death. Finished off the night with a drambuie and a vodka at about 8pm but we have had a busy day ",2
"Everything was awesome! From the freshness of the table bread and salad, to the main course. This restaurant is not big by any means, but definitely worth the wait for a table. Portions are generous and dishes extremely tasty and authentic family owned ! You will not be disappointed. I'm just sorry I didn't save room for dessert.",2
"If you're in the mood for a hot dog or sausage sandwich, you'll like JJ's. But, if you go there hoping for something more, prepare to be disappointed. Their chili is good on a dog, but not great on its own. Balsamic salad dressing was very blah. Both the Italian sausage and Andouille sandwiches are good. Their onion rings are the skinny shoestring kind.",1
"I wish I could give them more stars. I really love revolving sushi, well sushi in general, but Teharu and Sushi Station my favorite are better. What I will give them is 1 point because it's revolving sushi and 1 point because it's clean and modern inside. Still Teharu, repaint that poop colored wall Seriously . Not bad, not great. 2.5 Stars realistically.",1
"There was meat on the cheese slices, onions mixed in with the other veggies. Not your usual clean Subway. I have been to Subways in third world countries that were cleaner than this place. nThe girl behind the counter was not friendly either. nShe barked at me when I entered the building. nI love Subway, but will not be going back to this location.",1
I found my new fav coffee place in town. It's always the little hole int he wall corner shops that get me. The gal's who run the shop are so personal and inviting. I am coming back here for sure. they made me the BEST iced Americano with white mocha i've ever had. and it's 32oz. how awesome is that?!,2
"It's your standard chain hair salon. The staff is always nice and talkative, sometimes too talkative is there a way to make a note in the computer as to if you like to be talked to or not? nReasonable rates. They offer discounts coupons frequently. I do LOVE the online check in via the app. Makes it so much easier to check in and decrease the wait time.",2
well we heard nice things about the hotel and my son reserved a few nights. He has horrible experience of having his IPOD stolen. He was the only one who had a key to the room. that leaves the cleaning people. Hotel Has not own up to it and gave my son a run around. I do not recommend this hotel. obviously their security is very poo.,1
I've driven by a zillion times always wanted to stop. The owner was very friendly luv's what he does. Engaged us both laughed and joked. We just came for a cappuccino chia this time but the menus looked very inviting made me want to stay and eat. Next time for sure. Outside seating street side and in the back. Small inside seating.,2
I don't know why the hell I KEEP GOING to this place when I know that I can't chew threw the rib tips! I don't know what there doing to the poor meat to just dry it up like that! Geeze! Maybe it's the BBQ sauce that I crave from time to time. I'm not going here again. Damnit! So unhappy and STILL hungry!,1
"Cool layout big bar! But the girls? Alot of them look like there on drugs. I say they ranged from zeros to a couple of 5s. Sad to say watching the customers was more amusing than watching the girls. Not only were they not cute, but their dancing was WACK. the dj played pretty good music tho. Drinks were weak. I left without a lap dance. Need I say more?",1
"The only reason this restaurant is getting two stars is because of their great outdoor patio. Otherwise the food wasn't very good and the service was very poor. However, I think this restaurant has potential they have a good menu if they could get someone to cook the items well. I will return, but probably just for a drink on the patio.",1
I like pizza but this is not what I expected. Many years ago this was a Monona institution with great thin crust pizza cut into squares. Now it's thin crust has the taste of chalk and toppings are tiny and the sauce has gone towards ketchup. Terrible I'm very sorry to say. Nice bar area but it's not the Pizza Oven of old.,1
Got there around 11 30pm and there was a huge line. I was surprised it was so packed. My friend greased the bouncer and our group walked past the line and straight in. The club itself is nice but it's small. I didn't even attempt to go downstairs to the dancefloor because it just looked so packed. The music was really good top 40 and hip hop .,1
"Chicken fried steak! Thats all Im going to say. They give you huge portions for the price. The only thing I felt uncomfortable about is the tightness of the place. Its always packed and there is barely any room to walk. This can easily be solved by calling in the order and just picking it up. Bottom line, food is great but place is a bit tight.",2
"I only come to Vegas for this place and this location. I have not ever been to the other one but don't want to risk my Shrimp Basket being prepared different. Love this place and our server was Fantastic.I can't remember her name, but she was a sweety.wrote huge Happy Birthday and Thank You on our bill and circled the gratuity that was charged to us. We had NO PROBLEM! SHE WAS GREAT!",2
"I was told the wings here were good and I should check it out since it was close to my hotel. nAdmittedly, the wings were good and the beer was cold but the bar smelled like someone yacked in the corner and no one cleaned it up. nI grabbed a seat at the bar, the bartender was fine Cory? and did her job well. I would go back for wings but someone need an air freshener in there.",1
We walked over here to eat a late lunch after picking up some goodies at Flemming's bakery. I had the chicken wrap with sweet potato fries and he had the classic burger with coleslaw. Everything was really good. Along with the check our waitress brought 2 ginger snaps soft and delicious. We will be back!,2
"Horrible, Horrible Horrible. Im from california, drove all the way out here to find out why my grandfather was rushed to emargency, and didnt find out until 2 hours after doctors and nurses passed by me. This place is the Martin Luther King hospital from L.A, In l.a. we call it ""killa King "" because not too many patients make it out",1
"Dr Tafreshi and his staff are nothing short of amazing. Referrals, lab work, blood panels, x rays, everyone who helps you is professional, quick and efficient. This office is a diamond in the ruff in Vegas where medical is pretty much a joke. It's a breath of fresh air to walk into an office and actually be helped. I def recommend this office",2
"I really liked this place a lot. The guy working was really friendly and helpful, let me see as many pieces that I wanted. Prices are great and everything is locally made. To be honest the two things that made this place were the guy working and the fact that everything is local. The shop was clean, the guy was knowledgeable. I will definitely be back.",2
"If you love Paris, you will feel right at home here! Very French! We had a delightful lunch on the patio, well protected from a brief rain. I had the lobster special, pre shelled and served cold with a light dijonaise on the side, with points flutes. The salad too was crisp with a light vinaigrette. Well worth it!",2
"It was expensive for the small portions of food. It was a hard location to find. I would recommend this place for someone who is watching what they eat but not what they spend. The fruit was drenched in a pineapple guava juice that was off putting. The burrito was as big as one of my hands. However, the raisin walnut french toast was good.",1
"One word GREASY. The meat and vegetable dishes are so soaked in oil that you can't even taste the food anymore. Sushi is crap, and nothing on the buffet line seemed freshly made. I guess for 10.59 you get what you pay for. Better off buying a good piece of steak and cooking it at home. The only thing I enjoyed eating was fresh fruit and dessert",1
"I guess you have to be from nu yowk to like this and I'm not, so I have to say for me it taste like little caesar pizza. Insipid and tough dough, salty thick tomatoes greasy tasteless cheese, the opposite of what italians from italy like in a pizza. Loud surfer music, landscape help in the kitchen. nCan't save this place. Pizza classified as waste of calories and left it on the tray.",1
"degree270 could be a really cool spot, but it's a miss in a lot of ways. Pros Amazing views, terraces, open layout, part of the casino Cons No cocktail servers, interior is cheaply done, no furniture on the terraces, won't allow you to open the doors because the air conditioning can't compensate, serve cocktails in plastic cups, decent appetizers but not worth the prices.",1
"The fried appetizers were good in flavor but were soggy and were dripping with grease. I think the veggies were frozen. I got the lighter side grilled chicken which tasted a little funny and the grilled veggies were super dry. I also think the ice tea was instant because it didn't taste fresh. Our server was really nice, though, which is the only reason I'm giving this place two stars.",1
"I don't think I've had a better taco salad you know the one with the crispy tortilla shell ever in my life. Obviously, a taco salad is representative of authentic mexican, but it still warms that spot in my heart where Tex Mex should be. It's worth it and they deliver to certain parts of the Plateau Mile End Little Italy.",2
"The Parrots are a nice touch, but did little to make me feel better about the place. The rooms made me think of someone's grandmother's condo. Pink walls, old furniture, lacey sort of pillows. It just felt a little dirty to me. Check out took a year and a half. I could have fathered a child. Several. Location to ASU good. Almost everything else? Fweh.",1
"Really good BBQ. Tried the brisket, hot links, tater salad, cowboy beans, cornbread and fried okra. Great hickory smoked flavor that is not common in AZ. Fresh, cornmeal battered okra fried up perfectly, Good sized portions and fairly priced. Said they have blues bands on Tuesday and Jazz Blues on the weekend.",2
"This is paradise for beer connoisseurs. A range of beer that confuses, bedazzles and quenches you thirst for quality brews. The selection on lager and ales on tap as well as in the 'beer cave' make this place one of a kind. The special hummus, fries, hot dogz, and pizza make it the perfect hangout place any given day in Pittsburgh",2
"Found this place after a recommendation from a friend and it was definitely worth the trip. So many great sandwiches to choose from. I ended up going with the Bella on Dutch Crunch bread, but be sure to order it with bacon. It's so good. I really like that all of the sandwiches come with a Carmel Apple lollipop too. It's a little off the beaten path, but definitely worth the trip!",2
L'hamburger steak est ok mais trop ch u00e8re. Il commence u00e0 4.50 mais peut monter facilement u00e0 une dizaine de dollars avec les extras. Le take out peut prendre facilement une quinzaine de minutes pour un hamburger . Trop de boucane u00e0 l int u00e9rieur aussi lorsque il est en pleine production.,1
I just picked up a Arizona burrito. The burrito was cold and the meat was un eatable. I figure since it was the only thing open I would give it a shot. I feel like it needs to be good since they stay open 24hours. I am very disappointed that I spent 7 and my time waiting to get a burrito that sucked! If it wasn't 12 45am I would go get my money back!,1
Bar Crudo is FABULOUS! We are from NYC and have been having trouble finding restaurants that are consistently good. Bar Crudo is consistently GREAT! The food is original and as fresh as can be! We have been there five times and it just keeps getting better! I'm so thankful to have a NYC quality restaurant right here in Phoenix! WE LOVE CRUDO!,2
"All the food offered sucks balls except the heaping mound of french fries for like 2 that the cook fries up quite well , and the owner guy is a TOOL, the kind of jerk that thinks it's okay to banter in a talking shit put down kind of manner with a complete stranger as if they were a long time friend. Fake friendly doesn't cut it in the service industry.",1
My wife and I are from Australia and we were looking for a mother ring for her. I saw all the good reviews on Yelp about Rudy and Norma so we paid them a visit. We were not disappointed. Rudy made my wife a ring over the Xmas period in a timely fashion.and before we returned home. My wife and I are extremely happy with the craftsmanship and quality of the ring. THANKS Rudy !,2
"This company is a joke. Spent 10 or 15 minutes on a party bus for the entire night. After booking months in advance and calling week of to confirm, we still weren't on the list night of. After a below average experience, management was not receptive into comping anything to defuse the situation. Instead we were given attitude and treated like scum. Learn how to run a business.",1
"Great find. Great ambience but.really meager pour on martinis. I ordered their well vodka for a martini and it was a 3oz pour, which is pretty small.It was 7. At nearby Venues in carefree, during Happy Hour, their 6 oz. martini to the brim with the Well vodka is 7. I am very eager to go back as their wine is good and reasonably priced but since I am a martini drinker, I may not go back. A shame.",1
"Okay. You don't feel like you are in Vegas. It's conviently connected to the Bellagio. Loved the kitchenette. NOT PLEASED with housekeeping leaving my room A JAR when they were done cleaning. NOT PLEASED with hotel manager who did absolutly NOTHING when I reported this. Um yeah. It was my 7th visit to Vegas this year. And I'll NEVER stay at Vdara again. Thanks, but no thanks.",1
"Picasso was wonderful! Exactly what it should be! The view of the Bellagio fountains was a very nice bonus, not to mention the artwork on the walls! We were dining with an extremely picky eater aka pain in the ass and they were very polite about her being difficult. I caot say much here that hasn't already been expressed!",2
I love coming here and I always get good service but today I got the worst service ever! Waited 30 min for the check when I finally got it and had the card ready no one came waited another 15 min I decided to just get up and go look for the girl and give it in her hand. We never got our drinks refilled either.,1
"Don't spend your money here! We're very disappointed at this place, food was too dry. Looked like it was sitting there on trays for too long. Steamed salmon, crab, sushi were not fresh. Soup and Chinese food were way too salty. The worst Buffet I ever had, never going back again. Price was too high for the quality of food.",1
"Does any other movie theater exist in Vegas now? nLove this theater, not sure if its the reclining chairs, the general personal feel of the theater or the fact that there is an assortment of sausages. not to mention wine and beer. LOVE at first ticket price, which happens to be the same as rave, or any regal theater. Only problem, it has few theaters, so less movie choices.",2
"I went to this gym twice and both times it smelled? i could not stand breathing in this gym? I went here with a coworker since it was close to our work, but ended up working out at the Surprise location due to the smell of the place. Hopefully it has changed, but that factor would make me not want to go to the gym.",1
"While in Vegas I love eating at the Leone Cafe for a nice italian breakfast and cappuccino.They serve healthy oatmeal, an italian breakfast wrap with hummus, mediterranean omelets, paninis and more! nDelicious food, great atmosphere, wonderful friendly staff. Check it out this yummy cafe in the Tivoli Village across from the Sun Coast Hotel.",2
My daughter Mackenzie has been coming here for about 4 months and absolutely loves it! The kids class is very well organized and is is a great way for kids of all skill levels to get a basic understanding of Capoeira. My daughter gets so excited for Saturdays now because she knows she's going to have a blast!,2
"Chick was nice and friendly long dark hair, older gal from NY , but she didn't take much time on the haircut, maybe 10 minutes. Never saw a scissor or the back of my head, it felt like a drive through hair cut. She did say that she is devoted to her job, but she not take enough time and have any concern for my head. The cut turned out OK, but this is not called Speedy Cuts at 15.",1
"I brought my girlfriend here to have her new shoes stretched after reading the other Yelp review. The owner helped her out immediately, her shoes were ready and we were on our way in 5 minutes. The owner was really nice and helpful and didn't even charge us at all! I would definitely recommend this shop. Cash only.",2
"Absolutey bad restaurant. My husband ordered Clam Chowder soup soup, for goodness sakes! and it was VERY salty. They gave him another one and it was still too salty. I ordered Tuna Tartare and that was too salty as well. I didn't bother asking for another plate. And we saw another guest return his food as well. Perhaps it was just a bad night, but never again will we go back.",1
" Hai, Yes, it's true . FIVE STARS This is the place for Traditional Chinese.you'll love the menu. nThe dishes .are not lacking in sauce. nEach dishes sauce.is distinct from other entrees sauces. nPortion size is very good. nEverything tasted FRESH. The Wait Staff.is top notch. Unlike George Sons nThe Hot Tea is FREE nAlso, Brown Rice is FREE nAt George .You'll pay 2 for each.",2
"Dear reviewers reading, nI normally go to the Arrowhead JC Penny, its nicer and bigger. I read he reviews on here saying that this one is bigger, I could honestly say they didn't carry a large selection of dresses here at all. Also the ladies selection here is much smaller. I was disappointed and left.",1
"I know all fast food workers don't use gloves, but this confuses me. I was sitting in the drive thru my daughter wanted a shake I hate this location and I'm watching a young man peel a banana with his hands the break it into pieces with his hands, put it into a cup, the wipe his hands off onto his black apron. Kinda gross. Is his apron clean?",1
"Tried the 7.77 deal after signing up for the player's card. The steak was a bit dry, should have gotten it medium instead of medium well. Shrimp, mashed potatoes and veggies were good. Was a bit disappointed by the slow service considering it was quite slow. Overall though I would be back if I was in the hard rock hotel. Can't beat that deal!",2
Love this bakery.it's actually the only Korean bakery I go to. The lady is always so sweet and happy and the interior is warm cute and comfortable. I love the tapioca bread which is a chewy plain bread.and the custard filled bread is my boyfriend's favorite. We also get the shaved ice all the time. Oh and small downside is you have to pay cash unless your purchase is over 20.,2
"I bought a new house that had nice tile and carpet but needed a good cleaning.the grout of the tile was black in some areas when it should have been white. Although it cost more than I wanted to pay, the results were amazing! So it was totally worth it! It didn't take very long either! My new place looks great thanks to my tech ""Jan "". Ask for him! This is my new floor cleaning company forever!",2
The service here is horrible! We sat we for 15 minutes before our drink our cane. We had to sit another 45 minutes before our meal came. There restaurant is empty. Nobody ever came to check on our drinks prior to our meal arriving. The meals came and he checked our meal one minute after the meal arrived and never came back to check on our meal or drinks. Our bread 2 servings was never replaced,1
"Just a typical nail salon. Nothing special! And the same prices as every nail shop. They did a bad job on my acrylic nails 20 , not even, color dripping off because she put to many coats. My friend got a pedi 22 they didn't open a clean set of tools for her. I don't know why people love this place, nothing special.",1
"The food was very yummy! However, they do not accept debit credit cards for payments under 15. This goes against the Merchant Service Contract businesses sign to accept Visa MasterCard. One District does not post their policy. One District just expects their customers to spend more money in their establishment. This customer will not be spending any more money there.",1
"so we decide to grab a bite before the NYE craziness.I get a bacon, cheese hotdog.it was like 6.95 just for the dog.OMG r u serious? Totally not worth it.and the bf got the philly cheese steak and fries combo.it was totally dry and NG not good .we liked the environment at the MGM food court but Nathan's was a total bust here.not worth the 20 we spent here.",1
I ate there Thursday evening 6 12 14 the service was very slow and they had some weird techno music playing. The food was ok but not worth the price you had to pay. They screwed up my order and I had to wait a extra long time for my order while the other people in my party were half way finished with there's. I won't go back.,1
"Been coming here for years since they opened back in 06 because the food tastes great. Beats the pants off of Panda Express or Kyoto Bowl because the food is made fresh when you order. Super psyched that the brand has expanded to a few other locations in the Tempe and Mesa area, hope they open shop in Chandler next!",2
"Famous chef, high expectations. Few options on the menu but what you get is always good and you expect the fewer the choices the closer to perfection.and you would be correct . The service was good, the food was cooked to perfection the salmon and even the chicken were moist and full of flavor . You need reservations or you will be waiting a while it's Vegas . Pricy but worth it",2
"I start with a 5 and then see how much things go. So 1 for employees being so slow. Management needs to get them some red bull. 1 out of new bread and other types. 1 out of sweet tea. 1 out of some cookie types. so that leaves them with 1 star sad but coworkers say this is typical there. There are a lot of places to eat in the area, try them first. 2 30 pm 7 7 14 ",1
My wife and I have been here several times. At least once a week. I asked her today she said like 44 times. Probably not that much but it definitely is worth the 5 star rating. Service. The price. And now for the food Sliced beef Pho. Spring rolls. Beans with minced pork. Chicken curry is also a must try. Come here and you won't be disappointed.,2
I went here today with a my family that was in town.The service was VERY bad. It took a LONG LONG time to get the food and it was not busy at all. The food itself is overpriced and unfortunately not worth the money or the wait. This place needs to get its act together quick because it does not take close to one hour to prepare a sandwich!,1
"This pub, across the street from Pizzeria Bianco, has a great, old style pub feel. Nestled in an old house in Heritage Square, the service is prompt ad generally friendly. I went with friends for dtfn, and while I only ordered drinks Guinness, of course I'm looking forward to going back soon to try the food.",2
"Love this theater. It is conveniently located off US 60, they have the best pre show entertainment with their First Look, they have the most comfortable stadium style seating, concessions selection is great, the staff is helpful and friendly. The stadium style seating is very important when you're short. I have never had a viewing issue at any AMC Theater. ",2
"Loved this place! I was recommended by a friend who said it was amazing, and I couldn't agree more. I got a brazilian done with the owner I forgot her name , and it was the least painful wax I've ever had. The wax was quick and not painful compared to other places I've been to . The location is very discreet, and it's small and cute. Everyone was very nice, which is always a plus.",2
I don't understand why restaurants can invest in filtered water. The water at this venue is terrible. They use the syrup and Tea to cover up the taste and smell. Ultimately drinking it is not good for your body. Guys and investment in filtering your water will increase the quality of the experience your customers have.,1
No one told me this place was on the same level as the Riviera. Come on I couldn't believe how bad they let this place slip. I used to come here often. Stopped for several years. No real reason why. A friend came in town and got a room here. Everything from the casino floor to the rooms looked like it needed updating. Not worth the money. O and the buffet is disgusting and vile.,1
"Loved this place. The gelato mmm, coconut gelato , the chocolate, the crepes. My cousin and i frequented this patisserie several times a day. The only real CON is that this place is always packed. So the wait time can be long and there are tons of tourists looking at the chocolate fountain.so its kinda chaotic. But still. a fan. ",2
"Great location, awesome bartenders, good drinks. I was in Las Vegas for my 21st birthday. I admittedly don't remember much but I do remember I loved this bar. The drinks were strong and our bartender guy with a Mohawk I believe his name was Derrin was amazing. He was entertaining and gave me a few drinks on the house for my b day. He was really the reason we came back the next night.",2
"Thank you Petiquette for being patient with our Maine Coon and sending him home with a fresh lion cut! Being the parent of a bossy, attitude y, entitled cat rare, but yes, they do exist. I am sometimes nervous that new groomers will not give my guy a chance, but you assured me you would and you did. For that I thank you and I promise to tell all my friends about you!",2
"Small store with lots of vintage guitars and a few new ones at a variety of price points. We came in to do some tire kicking and the owner introduced himself and let us pluck away. I didn't end up buying anything, but appreciated the owners attention when we needed or wanted it, a useful guitar resource for the neighborhood.",2
"Thai Place is not the best Thai food I've had. The food is not that flavorful or well made and their ""specials "" aren't that special. The restaurant is also not the cleanest around. If you want great Thai food, venture into downtown or the North Side and go to Nicky's Thai Kitchen it is significantly better.",1
"Hurray! Rate increase. gag No warning, and I'm paying more for a package where I could upgrade for LESS. Going to call today but based off what I have read in reviews I am not holding my breath. Though I know its not much better, I wish Time Warner, Google Fiber, Comcast or any other provider was available besides this company.",1
"Two words my wife and I said to each other as we were walking out. ""Never again "" 14 for a sundae that was just ok while Max Brenner is just a walk away! I knew this place was going to be a tourist trap but others wanted to go regardless of the bad reviews. I'd rather buy 3 different pints of Ben and Jerry's from the supermarket.",1
"I am a native of the 'Burgh who has permanently relocated to Tucson, AZ, as well as a 4 decade veteran Pitt staff member. On a visit to Pittsburgh I ate here twice in one day. Lunch was excellent for a number of reasons and dinner was better than acceptable, but not nearly as good in concept, amenities and value as lunch. Do lunch here and dinner somewhere else.",2
Slooowwwwww service with a bunch of kids running the store. Not that kids can't do business too. I just don't think they have a good enough syStem down for the volume they get here. Time to add another trop on blue diamond the surrounding areas OR get more people working on site! 20 min proceSs no less. ,1
"Ordered delivery. It arrived pretty quickly. I ordered one of the dinner boxes with szechuan chicken, general Tso and fried rice. The szechuan chicken was alright, not amazing, but ok. The general tso was kind of grisly and not super appetizing. All in all, it tasted like any other dime a dozen Chinese place. Nothing special and basically interchangeable with any other common Chinese place.",1
"A must if you're at MGM just cruising around. It's on the bottom floor. Pizza was delish and very fresh tasting ingredients. It didn't take long to cook either, maybe 5 7 minutes. We looked for another location in Northern CA, but this chain is still new ish. Would definitely check it out if they come anywhere near my hometown.",2
Great coffee drinks horrible service. Wait over a hour for waffles and fake eggs. Under manned and over priced . Not sure if I would go back. But the coffee cake BZB was fire! Luke the thought of the wafflewich but dry and needs a real egg. which would also make it less dry if the egg was over easy.,1
"Previously I gave them 5 stars, but now only 2. As the technician just solve the problem with my AC for couple of weeks. So, when he came he diagnosed freon leak. So, he just add freon and even didn't try to search for leak. So, as the leak wasn't fixed by him, the freon that he added leaked after two weeks and again my AC WAS BLOWING WARM AIR.",1
"Thank you to Nicole for helping me today when I came to pick up my Madden 25. She was very informative explained the value of each trade in game I brought in. She also showed me the codes for a special bonus I received for pre ordering the game, much appreciated. I'm definitely coming back here to get future releases",2
" 4.50 for a corona?! C'mon! That is ridiculous. For just 2 more I can buy 6 of them. Also, their margaritas aren't anything special. I ordered a chambord margarita with patron tequila and it was just meh. It was really sweet and they use that pre made margarita mix. If you're going to charge 9 for a margarita at least use the quality margarita mix or make your own.",1
"DE LI SCIOUS! Just had the Tamari, Lobster, Chifa and TNT rolls last night with girlfriends and could not have been happier with the sushi. Rivals some of the best sushi I've had anywhere.and I LOVE sushi! Sevice was fantastic as well. All of the waiters suggestions were right on for drinks, tapas, and dessert. Neighborhood is a little sketchy, but the new one up in Warrendale looks really nice.",2
" No Credit Cards accepted! Prices were cheaper than WalMart ONLY by a few cents not worth waiting in line for a small savings! WalMart will match WinCo's ad. Parking was ok, busy on a Friday afternoon. No available shopping carts. Lines were so long, as if this was the ONLY grocery store in the entire Valley! check out my photos Bulk food area. Too busy for my liking",1
"Food is great, real authentic italian food. Sushi bar seems a little out of place, but the sushi chef is great and the sushi is actually very good. The filet mignon was not worth the price, it was tasteless but EVERYTHING else on the menu is delicious. I have been a couple of times. It is bring your own wine.",2
"If the line wasn't so long, they would have received five stars. The people here are friendly and competent. I had to interact with at least four employees for pick up and drop off, and they were all great. No, really all of them were really great. They offer you bottled water as well. It was 107 degrees. I appreciated that.",2
"STELLAR Happy Hour Prices. More 2.00 food options than I have ever seen! Martinis might have been 3.00? I forget. But it wasn't crappy well liquor either! Tons of outdoor seating but like most PHX restaurants the views were of the parking lot as well as Desert Ridge. Tons of indoor seating as well. ""Acoustics "" not so great but I dont see it intende to be a romance destination.",2
Wal Mart will rip you off if your are using there family mobile cell plan. and If you try to CXL they will even get more from you. Beware. When I called to CXL they said my Extra pack funds will be lost they will just keep them for there pockets. and to top it off they also charged 5.00 to make the payment over the phone. Buyer be where if you are using there cell plan.,1
I would not recommend taking the time to find out if the food has improved. Sad. the owner should read the reviews and figure out what is going on. The crust was limp and the sauce was scarce. About the best thing that I can say about the pizza was that it was that I will not get acid reflux from eating it. There are much better places in the South Charlotte area.,1
"Wow, amazing! Came here with a group of girls and we pretty much ordered like 6 burgers and tried them all out. My fav was the banh mi, of course. I really like the casual and laid back atmosphere however was in a random part of town and in a strip mall. Inside, you feel like you could be in San Francisco or LA.",2
"Purchase a Group OWings Wings cooked well on the other hand the flavor garlic parmesan tasted more like fettuccine alfredo. Better off going to BWW sauce is better but chicken is smaller nPizza it was fair had better. I love pizza but after eating two wings, that messed up the whole meal . nWould I eat here again Heck No I was better off ordering food from the street cart workers in ca.",1
"Great place to go and relax or party hard depending on the day of the week you go! Pool tables, dart boards, air hockey, and game room 7 days a week and karaoke and poker on Wednesday and Saturday! Theres also Trivia Tuesdays and much more! One of the greatest little hole in the wall bars I've been to in a long while!",2
"This is my favorite new bar in Scottsdale. The wall art is awesome and the music is always right on for my ""going out "" mood. It gets super packed so if you're planning on going on a Friday or Saturday night get there early so you don't have to fuss with the lines. It's definitely a party hard or go home type of place so be ready to boogie down if you step foot in the door.",2
"Nothing bad to say about this Starbucks. Typical Starbucks inside and out. Stopped in early to get a coffee and breakfast sandwich. Quite a few people in line, but my drink and sandwich was prepared quickly and came out hot! Enjoyed my breakfast at an outdoor table surfing with their free wifi. Nice to find a Starbucks close to my hotel.",2
"Romantic BYOB place. A little pricey, the food tends towards meditteranean french influence but tasty. I come really for the desserts which they will do for take out . A nice place for a lunch or romantic dinner. Also, you can have them cater baby showers and birthday parties in the house next door.",2
My favorite place to go in LV for comfort food Hawaiian style. Can't go wrong with the Prime Rib Special for 9.99.it comes with the salad bar Cherries Jubilee Ice Cream desert. I also like the T Bone steak the Country Fried Steak. The salad bar is decent.overall good food for the value! Need I say more,2
"Old fish. Good service, yet unapologetic. The paella was flavorless with no hint of saffroor fish broth. Hubby tells me mixing meat and fish in paella is a no no in Spain. Not a big deal to me, if the shrimp didn't have a moldy aftertaste. Luckily we are headed to cilantro for a sangria taste off slash clean our palate adventure. Not likely to return anytime soon.",1
"I probably spend more time at this store than any others. Hard to get out of there without spending money, there's always something new and a good buy. Only bitch is the line tends to get long to check out often. Worth the wait though. And returns are a snap, they didn't ask any questions the few times I had to return something.",2
"My friends took me here on our way home to Los Angeles from Las Vegas. They couldn't say enough good things about the lobster enchiladas so I ordered one a la carte. It was OK. The sauce was sweet but really not flavorful. This place is a bland version of the American version of a genuine Mexican restaurant. However, the service was really great! If you want Mexican food, go somewhere else.",1
"I ate at almost every Thai restaurants in Vegas and I can tell you guys that they have one of the best, if not the best Pad Thai in Vegas. I tried the combination one 5 10 spicy. They also have very good service and the place is very clean! The ambience at night is also really good. Can't wait to go there and try more things on their menu!",2
"Was a mediocre store, now it's just worthless. They don't have credit card readers at each pump they have one reader in the middle for all of the pumps. They also recently got rid of most of their bottled soda flavors, opting for just a few of the most popular flavors. No root beer. No Coke Zero. Etc. .",1
"Brought my dogs in here twice. First time I brought my dogs in to stay here for a week, when I picked them up one was limping. Ok whatever stuff happens. Brought them in a second time for another week a few months later. One of them was limping again and eye was kinda wonky and shut as if had been kicked. I am never bringing my dogs back here again. I Do not trust these people at all.",1
"I can't even imagine going to that ""green and gold "" place again! Super friendly and absolutely delicious sandwiches! I ordered a typical turkey sub with provolone and it was made to perfection. The fact that they slice the deli meat to order was the kicker for me. The bread is perfection.soft and has great flavor. Do yourself a favor, have some good sense and head to Mr. Goodcents!",2
"Maybe it was an off day for them but the food was NOT good. I have been to other Sweet Tomato's and enjoyed the food but last Friday this location was disappointing. The salads were limp and obviously not fresh. The noodles were dried out on the pasta bar and I had to spit out the chocolate pudding cake. It had a dry, pasty taste. Not sure we will ever try a Sweet Tomato again.",1
Sat on outside patio for breakfast and started with mimosa and bloody Mary's. The carrot cake pancakes were absolutely amazing. Omelettes were standard. We had a great view and great people watching. Restaurant is full and staff is very busy. The hot chocolate was amazing. And some of the drinks people were having looked amazing and were huge!,2
"Bout as low quality pizza as you can get, but it definitely can serve a quick, greasy pizza fix if you need one. They have a drive thru so you can literally drive off with an 800 calorie greasy square slice of pizza for 4.50 in under one minute. It is probably best to go around peak times so it'll be fresh or to ask which slices are most recently cooked .",1
"Low quality, overpriced Mexican food some of the worst guacamole I've ever had. Go for the fun atmosphere, NOT the food! Our waitress was really, really nice though, so they get an extra star! They had a good bar atmosphere and a super slutty, girl who looked like a prostitute dancing on the front table, pouring shots into people's mouths a couple of my friends partook, it was fun to watch!",1
"I have been coming here for 2 years and LVG is STILL my favorite place to eat in Charlotte. I work uptown and will walk out of my way to come here at least 2x a week. The staff is incredible. They are fast, friendly and always remember my order when I arrive. The line moves quickly and for what you pay, you cannot get a better gyro or pita.",2
Service took about 2 hours! Completely under staffed. The food was okay. I got the strawberry banana Nutella waffle. It was good. My bf got the green tea waffle. It was horrible. Won't be going back here again because of the service. I feel sorry for the people who are over worked and under staffed.,1
I was looking everywhere for a juice called Bettie White by Uncle Junk's which is one of my favorite juices. The vibe in the shop is cool. One of the owners Marcus was super nice. He totally took apart and cleaned by vaporizer tank and put in some of this Japanese cotton and it's hitting like its brand new again. I highly suggest this place if your in the neighborhood.,2
"Not too impressed with this place. First of all, the prices are too high. 3.60 for a taco that has guacamole? And for the amount of guacamole I did get, I can't believe I had to pay extra for it. The menu was incredibly limited. Other than beef, they offered no chicken or shrimp dishes. Very odd. And no fountain drinks. And they were slow. Don't believe all the 5 star reviews.",1
Well.let's see.my girlfriend soup was cold.they brought the wrong keiche for my stepmom then ignored her when she told them about it.they didn't bring my dads salad at all.they ignored requests for ice water.oh yeah the chef walked out and didn't return.I'd say I'll neve return but looks like this place is gonna be gone soon,1
"I have only had the Gyro and Beef Souvlaki, but they were both really good. Its a small place but does have several booths to sit at. The meat they use is really tender and has a good flavor. Portion size are what you would expect as well as the prices. I am looking forward to trying more items on the menu.",2
"I had heard about this place years ago, and finally found out what I've been missing out on! Oh my delicious, we loved this place. The chips and salsa were a great start. All very flavorful and fresh, that's always a good start. We all ordered a dish that included the Adovado.amazing! Lots of other things on the menu to try, we will definitely be going back.",2
"Good Venue! Set up well and great acoustics! Sat in the balcony for a concert and had an awesome view. There are a few restaurants right down the street that is just a quick walk from the Theater. Drinks were a bit pricey, but that is too be expected at any concert hall. Will definitely find an excuse to come to another show and try the floor seats.",2
"This place is pretty awesome. It's crazy clean and organized, has an absolutely delightful selection of produce and offers fantastic healthy alternatives. I love that there's a butcher on hand to cut to order and they have a fully stocked 'picnic' section as well. With the use of their members card you can really save a bundle. I do believe we've found a new grocery store ",2
"I did come back and ordered a specialty ""Inferno "" pie that was on the chalkboard that day.and wow. I wish it was a permanent staple. I left so happy with my order it made my day. It was literally so tasty I didn't want to share with my wife or in laws.and didn't. Service was great and it will definitely be a ""go to "" sit down pizza place for us in the future.but they do offer carry out as well.",2
"Best custard ever! I can't seem to get enough! This place is always clean, staff is super friendly, burgers, fries and cheese curds are scrumptious too. Join their email club and you will get plenty of coupons, plus announcements of special event days. They had a 1 year anniversary special where we enjoyed 1 one scoop sundaes for 4 days in a row. YUM!",2
"Ew, this place is disgusting. We stayed in the fantasy suite building in the ""pool suite "" but it would have been more aptly named 'nightmare suite.' Old, dirty, broken. And way overpriced. You couldn't pay me to stay here again. The whole place feels old, dirty, cheap and trashy. I think you get the point. AVOID!",1
"Love the deals on 1.00 comics. Good location, as there are a lot of other cool shops in the shopping center. The staff was also quite friendly and willing to answer my questions. My favorite purchase here was a reusable Star Wars original of course shopping bag. I get so many comments from cashiers and other shoppers when I use it!",2
"C'mon, an easy win in a crowded Vegas club scene. I am not by any means a vivid clubgoer, but when I go I demand to be taken care of and damn does the Marquee do a good job. If you can avoid the crowd table bouncer promoter do what you gotta do to make it happen because the Marquee is consistently dope if you don't need to deal with the hassle.",2
"I am convinced that the kitchen in this restaurant contains only two things. A freezer and a microwave. There is absolutely nothing they serve that is worth the trip. And, their hours are incredible. Apparently they can survive being open for approximately three hours a day. We actually joke when we are driving by and make bets as to whether they will be open or closed!",1
"I was not impressed with their service. The desiger or representative who provided the estimate was late, condescending and dare I say lazy. He wanted to do the least possible with regard to his design yet provided a very expensive estimate. Based on that experience, we chose not to go with them and went with another firm and they provided much better service and professionalism.",1
I've been there several times trying various menu items and all have been good. The Chicken Fried Rice I always start with this on my 1st time in was flavorful and had lots of chicken and vegetables. I have moved on to Pepper Steak and Mongolian Beef and a few others and they have all been quite tasty.,2
"We decided to eat at The Florida Cafe because it was in our hotel. It took a while for us to get seated. The waitresses seemed off in their own world most of the time. We waited about 20 minutes before we even got our servers attention that we wanted to order. I thought the food was okay, but my husband loved what he got. When we needed refills, our waitress was nowhere to be found.",1
Reminded me a lot of Coffee Rush in Gilbert Chandler. Up to 32oz for iced coffee and decent prices. Fast service with plenty of treats we got a chocolate chip cookie which has a surprise cinnemon and. banana? flavour . nA bit hard to find as it's tucked in the corner of a small shopping centre but just look for The Codfather on the northeast corner when driving.,2
"Terrible service. Dudes are distracted. Some hokey system about tracking repairs that they ""guarantee "". Keep your receipt on you forever or it's not traceable. My screen was cracked. Not a complicated issue. Never fit very well, then it started freezing all the time nGuy basically told me to pay again. Waste of time. So much competition out there. Try harder.",1
Hands down the best Indian food we've had and that is saying something. Excellent vegetarian options and they made two perfectly executed custom Vegan dishes for my husband. Customer service was beyond expectations nice relaxed atmosphere and located off the strip so great prices for lots of amazing food. We will definitely be making a trip back.,2
This place was so much fun! I felt like a kid bouncing around for hours! The staff was nice and the people jumping were friendly. I recommend this place to my friends with or without kids when they come into town. Also I recommend Sky Zone to anyone who wants a change in their work out! Go jump for an hour and that will get your heart rate up! I'm looking forward to going back ,2
"Would u like a cup of small frothiness for 4? I was a bit disappointed with what I got. I ordered a small chai tea latte and i believe they forgot the liquid part of the drink. nI have had their mac n cheese with jalape u00f1os and that one was not too bad. nThis place is good for studying, eating and chatting with different rooms to cater to those needs. Opens late too.",1
"This little cafe is like coming home, Jackie is friendly and sweet. Ordered the award winning stuffed french toast and the hubby tried the baked pancakes. Everything on the menu looks amazing breakfast and lunch served all day. Very convenient and great value for price. Can't beat the homemade feel and atmosphere. Totally a gem in the city.",2
"Amazing club? Yes. Best club ever? No. I actually preferred Pure. Don't get me wrong, XS was lavish, gorgeous, and had plenty of lounging areas if you wanted to take a break from the dance floor. Just be warned that when you get to the dance floor, your feet will be stepped on repeatedly , and you will be elbowed and shoved like nothing you've experienced before except maybe a mosh pit .",2
This place was amazing! I ordered a cesar salad because I was scared of what to order YUM! My Mother in law ordered a chicken and spaghetti dish that blew my mind! I instantly regretted ordering the salad! Downside sodas are 3.50 a pop and no free refills Iced tea is imported and 8 bucks. Few seats but super cute. The wait staff was awesome! I will be back!,2
"This is the worst storage option available to students and others in the Madison area. They advertise dry, secure space but items got yellow mold on them. Bikes got rusty. They claimed you need a separate insurance policy to cover what a DRY secure location is supposed to offer. Do not use this location at any cost. Management was poor and very rude. Overall a bad experience for alot of money.",1
"its a really clean and pretty salon, i stopped in for a pedicure spontaneously. paid 30 tip for a pedicure but it wasn't worth the cost. didn't even get a sugar scrub or hot towel you have to pay extra for that the girl was nice but didn't make conversation and was kind of rough with the filing. won't go back.",1
It was a good show. My wife and I liked it. I dont know how he does what he does but it is very interesting. I dont think it is the best show. but it was entertaining to me. I probably like it more because i got free tickets off his website when i went. I paid 20 to be up front. He is talented. I dont watch the tv show but i liked this one.,2
"Had a pedi and gel mani done by Tina and they were both great. Such a relaxing massage on my legs and feet and loved the hot stone rubdown too. My manicure looks great too, no bubbles left behind and Tina even took out some tool I'd never seen before and kind of filed the side of my nails to make sure any excess was removed. Can't wait to come back!",2
"Rented a car from Firefly Car Rental in Las Vegas Nev. They did not have the car I requested in advance, I waited for over 40 minutes and still had to settled for a more expensive, older car that was not economical to drive and was several years old. I would not rent a car from this organization in the future.",1
"My 175 leather jacket was stolen here last night off of my chair literally next to me as we were taking a picture. Management was no help and made no offer to cover my loss. I would never expect that in a place that charges 15 20 for drinks. DTCR is sketchy, keep your belongings close to you or they might walk away.",1
"I have been here 5 times. Not sure why people rate it less than 4 stars. Either way they have vegan, vegetarian, and normal menus. Very flavorful. The quinoa pancakes are a great healthy choice to breakfast. Corn chowder is very good. My wife gets the vegan burger and says it's the best tasting vegan burger she has had. I love fresh healthy ingredients and this place has exactly that.",2
"Salty canned clam sauce. Thick overly capery veal piccata. Terrible cafeteria salad. No fresh pasta to be seen. This is college cafeteria Italian. Also, they wouldn't give us our free dessert because we didn't print the coupon. The manager was dressed like a midwestern dad in sneakers and jeans. The place screams ""I can't be bothered "" with customers.",1
"I have Spinato's probably once a week. I live close by one of the locations. I've tried everything on the menu and I would give every dish 5 stars. The pizza, however, rises above the rest and is the best I have ever tried. The staff is very friendly and carry the attitude, or pride, that they own the restaurant. Never have I had a negative experience at Spinato's.",2
"Average sushi. I sat at the sushi bar and the chef rarely look my way and it was slow, there was only one other person at the sushi bar! The chef never asked what I wanted, I had to approach him. Personally I will never go here again. Food is average and the service is poor. With so many sushi places here in Vegas I would recommend eating at another place.",1
Meh. My husband and I went to celebrate our friends anniversary and stayed 3 nights. The desk staff was very friendly but the line for check in was s l o w. Our room was okay until the second afternoon when the air conditioning developed a smell like backed up sewer. After midnight we finally were moved to another room. It was okay but nothing special.,1
"Paid 199 for a complete detail for my truck and very unhappy. They looked at it when I came to pick it up, and agreed the job was done poorly, and asked me to bring it back in. They did not even buff the top of the cab!. Well, no improvement 2nd time around. I'm not going back for a 3rd time, they got my money, and the only satisfaction I can get is to write this review! I will not go back!",1
"I've had my second experience at this C U gem and so far we are 2 for 2. Another comfortable street side table was provided for my daughter and I. A terrific wine by the glass accompanied our appetizer of flat bread with chorizo and cheese. She had a medallion if beef and I had scallops, cockles and",2
"Breaking my lease, 30 days notice and gotta pay 1500. When I was asked why, I told her my reasons and she said ""have you called us about it before? "" Um, no. It's not my responsibility to keep the homeless from dumpster diving. I can't get a full tub of hot water. Air conditioner is terrible. Can't have direct TV where my building faces. The best thing about this area is Mulligans Pub.",1
"MUY TERRIBLE! We were looking for something to take to eat on the drive back, and though sandwiches was a good option. Sandwiches might have been a good idea, BUT not from Canter's! I ordered a pastrami sandwich and paid approx. 13 for two slices of bread with some pastrami thrown in there. DON'T COME HERE. You should go somewhere else Subway is even better.",1
"My favorite go to post gym smoothie fix, fills my gut and cools me down. Same as valley wide chain company but the staff here is always very polite, nice and upbeat. Iris always greets me with a smile and a positive attitude, even when slammed with a long line, kids, and phone orderes! Staff and customer service always makes a difference! Give them a raise!",2
"Way too expensive for shooting guns. They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but 40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced. For 50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle. My friend shot an M4 w a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.",1
The best meal I ever had! It was worth every penny the tasting menu starts at 50 bucs a person . The quality of fish paired with the different flavors was amazing. I also loved the ceramic grill that you can cook your own meat on. Truly a unique experience. I recommend anyone who wants a high quality dining experience,2
"Tried to post a photo but can't figure out how. We ordered two chili cheese dogs. You would expect that to be smothered in chili, right? Um, nope. I think I count 5 beans meat total! Called the manager as it was take out and she said ""what would you like me to do ""? Oh, I don't know, offer a gift card for the value or something. Epic failure!",1
"I wish there was actually a Hardee's in the Chicago city limits, but I survive because of the many other Chicago eateries. Hardee's is one of the places I go to when I head down south from Chicago. The meals are big, but I always like having some leftover for another meal. This Hardee's always has nice staff well whenever I have been there.",2
"If it happens that your nail tech will mess up they not gonna redo it, still charge you 60 and if you try to complain they will tell you to never come back ! Never gotten my refund either. There are many other salons in the area who do nail art for much lower price and have way better customer service!",1
"Small venue, but excellent food! The service was top notch! It was worth the wait to be seated with a party of 8. I had the pollo slatado, and my wife had the Lomo slatado. Seasoning was not too spicy. Just enough to bring out the flavor in the the food when combined with the vegetables and fries. nPAUL R.",2
"I had a walk in at 7 30am on a Friday morning and was seated in a room stall within 5 minutes. They have plenty of people drawing blood, but I did see most people had an appointment. Location was very clean and less janky than I expected for Sahara and Maryland. Tina was very nice and made sure she added my other doctors to my standing order.",2
"Went here yesterday to experience what it's like in an indoor waterpark. Overall it was nice except everyone had to exit the water not once but TWICE. Let's just say not everyone swimming doesn't have bladder control. Anyways, food snacks are surprisingly cheap with a decent menu. Can't imagine what it's like in the summer. Admission is cheap to especially if you're a county resident .",2
"I severely limit my intake of bovine cows milk, so when I heard about Ronald's donuts vegan donuts I had to have one. After scoffing at the name McDonald's anyone? I found that their vegan donuts are amazing. If you are vegan and have not tried this donuts, stop what you are doing and head to this store. Tastes like Krispy Kreme. D",2
"Was super excited to go here during my vacation and they were closed despite going during their ""business hours "". It looked cool from the outside but it is TINY so keep that in mind, it might not be worth the cab bus ride if you are a tourist. I heard this place is run by volunteers but I would still think it would be a priority to be open during operating hours.",1
"LOVE THIS PLACE! A real neighborhood gem! I've been there twice for lunch and twice for dinner. Anxious to try more things on the menu as I have had a hard time trying to choose between all the great items. Great casual atmosphere with a bar and the inside dining area is open to the outside patio, also open for dining. Check it out!",2
What a disaster. For an organic restaurant the staff had no clue.couldn't even answer simple questions about the ingredients. I have never rejected a bottle of wine untile the waitress tried to serve us a corked bottle of wine.she seemed suprised that we would not accept the bottle. If you want to eat in a real locally sourced organic restaurant try Quiessence.,1
"The food is always consistently good, BUT the service at the bar is horrendous. My friends and I come here often and sometimes get the same bartender, Nicole M 224. She is not attentive or pleasant. It's always the same with her, so I finally decided to speak up. I'm not sure how management allows this.",1
"been here once, but must say best place for men. remember the days when you were a kid and your parents took u too the toy store? nwell this is it for the big boys. hahaha once you step in, you can be wondering around and finding things you want and need for hours. i just wish they had one of these stores in So. Cal",2
"Had friends staying at the Gold Coast, we ate at the restaurant, great service, great food. I'm not much on Asian cuisine, but this was great, lots of food and even my friends commented how great it was, and they found their new favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas. The waiter was very informative and helpful, took the time to explain things on the menu we didn't know about or understand.",2
"yes, as many others have noted, the produce and meat are iffy, it's often crowded and less than clean, and it's impossible to find an employee when you need one. however, the vast array of ethnic food, cheeses and beer make woodman's perfect for those of us who aren't loaded pretentious enough to shop at whole paycheck or willy street co op.",2
"Love Mexican food. Lived next door to this spot for a year. Ate there twice. Both times was very below average. Clean, but unfriendly staff and subpar food. I work from home, so instead would drive a few miles down the road and deal with the asu line for Mexican from a different spot. Was still worth it. Too bad",1
"One of the best drunk foods there is. as long as you have a DD. Certainly not the best pho of my life or even Chinatown, LV. But for being open late, serving up some decent pho at an ok price 8 9 a bowl , and for being open on New Year's! Solid 4 stars. And remember kids. the drunker you are, the better it tastes. As an added bonus, you'll feel less hungover the next morning too.",2
"If you like Chicken and you LOVE cheese, and aren't counting the calories, you must get the Pollo Magnifico. It's a deep fried burro filled with chicken and topped with jalapeno cream cheese, cheddar cheese and served with rice and beans. So delicioso. Yea that was the lil bit of hispanic girl coming out, don't laugh. lol The service is A Ok but the Food I'm definitely a fan of!",2
Was very disappointed with this place. Been going to a ramen place down the street for a while and always leave full and happy. came here after hearing all the hype about pho and wasnt happy. i totally would pick ramen over pho any day! the egg rolls were very good and that was the only good thing about the dinner!,1
"This place is great, smaller restaurant but it too has a very Japanese feel. Not by a bunch of bought Japanese decor just by atmosphere, steaming pots of broth and cooks in plan sight getting your order ready. Simple condiments, no extra American or generic Asian stuff but authentic to a noodle house. Reminds me of living in Japan.",2
"Recently discovered Firehouse Subs and have already been back twice. The subs are delicious, full of meat and full of flavor . The bread is very good. The restaurant is clean and spacious. This sub shop is so much better than Subway or a Jersey Mike's, it's ridiculous. Recommend that you try a Firehouse Subs and it will be goodbye to Subway forever!",2
"Guess I'm not the only customer who was taken advantage of with the tips. Had lunch with a family member. Food was so so. When we left I wrote an appropriate tip amount 16 . The following when I went to check my credit card balance, the waitress CHANGED my tip to 10.00 when I spent less than 20.00. Ridiculous! This is probably why they are losing customers.",1
If you like craft beer this is the place to go. Always a phenomenal stock of beer and reasonable prices. Food is just amazing. Havent had a bad dish yet. Great happy hour and food specials 2pm 7pm. Girlie and Laura are always fantastic bartenders. Shyla are food server keeps us fed and knows her stuff. Wonderful atmosphere and fun place.,2
"Not a fan of this particular location. I guess it's hard to compare it to the Goldilocks in the Philippines when they give you top notch customer services. Not very friendly at all and the vibe in here feels like your not wanted. Being a Filipino American I dislike when everyone talks Tagalog and I can't speak it but can understand it, be care what you say.",1
First time I had Eadie's was at work and they ordered a cake. Delicious! Stopped in for lunch and had the peppered steak with rice and a Mancini's roll. Can u say hooked? This is some of the best peppered steak I've ever had. Tender and seasoned to perfection. They only have it on Thursday and my waistline is happy about that.,2
"The food is good. Variety is sparse. Wish they had cottage cheese or apples or bananas as an alternative to potatoes. Not a lot of booths but so there is often a wait for seating. Tried it for lunch too as it is close to home tomato soup is very acidic and not very good, tastes like tomato paste. Grilled Cheese was ok.",1
"the Phoenix Art Museum Center was completed and waited with anticipation until its grand opening. Since then we have visited every year and it never disappoints. Make it a day, don't worry about food, get it there. Don't try to see everything at one time, that is, if you live in AZ . When we return, we alway feel likes its brand new.",2
"Not as big as other locations, and waiting area is pretty small, but the quality of food and service is same if not better. I ordered calamari and my gf got the truffle burger. Both were delicious and I loved the presentation on the black truffle burger. Drinks aren't that cheap, but its fun location. If you want and like Yardhouse food drinks then definitely stop by.",2
"Absolutely love Sprouts! Especially when I have gift cards to use there. Always find what I need here produce, snacks, tofu, almond milk, etc. Their deli section looks and smells fantastic! I really want to try their soups and sandwiches, one day. Overall, a great place and their sale prices are awesome.",2
Probably the worst waiter in the history of time. He sucked harder than a hungry Jew in Auschwitz. Standard Red Robin food. Mediocre atmosphere. Dog shit service. I'm sitting here at the table eagerly awaiting my check so I don't have to deal with people that suck so badly at their mediocre meaningless jobs. I wish I had 2 more hands to give more thumbs down.,1
"Another one of my favorites. it's a little crowded, and I'd appreciate if I could see the kitchen from the dining area, but the food has always been fantastic. It's definitely the best Mexican style food you will find in the Phoenix area. It's a little more upscale than most and with a few tweaks could definitely hit the 5 star mark. I also wish that the parking were a bit better.",2
"Great selection of beer. Great service at the bar. Went on a Sunday for the 50 off for locals deal. I only had a pretzel and it was good, nothing spectacular. Did not eat, other than that. Definitely a place I would come to again on a Sunday or during happy hour. At some point, I do plan on doing the burger challenge.",2
"Chef Steven hooks it up! Kushi oysters, king crab, lobster salad! what? that is right and it was awesome! come in for the happy hour.come in for the foods. if you love the ocean and all its succulent creatures then this is your spot. I love the lighter side of the dishes. but don't get me wrong they are still rich. but no butter or cream in sight!",2
"I love spicy food. I'm always picking the menu items with the little pepper by their name. But the spice at Naked Fish's was just WAY too much. My whole mouth hurt. And the food was really average. We had taken a cab from the strip on a recommendation for Naked and it was just not worth the effort. They were very nice, it's open late and the space was cute but we wouldn't go back.",1
"CFA is the cadillac of fast food. They have great food and their service is off the charts in my opinion. They are so nice that it almost makes you feel guilty for having them help you. I guess this is what happens when you get used to other fast food places throwing sub par food at you with a frown. But really, get here. I love it. It is my pleasure to submit this review.",2
"This place is fantastic. The service is outstanding, they know the product well, and prices are good. The fluids are the highest quality. I've tried others and they were at best tolerable. These taste great and they are made from natural ingredients. Best vaping store I've been to. Highly recommend.",2
"We took our car in for its yearly inspection. To our surprise, the car 'failed'. They quoted us 200 in repair work for a light which seemed to be working just fine. We took the car down the street for a second opinion where the car passed with no issues. There's something suspicious about this place. I'm just sayin'.",1
"I just had my first visit hear with a party of about 25 to celebrate a birthday. Since I didn't pick up the tab, I can't speak about the prices. Bread was very good and the antipasta was outstanding. Rigatoni was 3 stars, meatballs 4, spicy sausage 5, chicken piccata 4, tray of deserts 4 Enjoyable evening, very good food, and a nice relaxed unhurried atmosphere.",2
"Really your staff needs help. Why does it take 20 min for black bean soup. No one looked at me, I had to ask where the silverware was she looked at me and said on the table. Well it wasn't I had to get it myself off another table. Ask for water she just pointed. The best part for me is I'm the head concierge at a large hotel here. And trust this place doesn't exist.",1
"Expected better. Service was horrible. People around us, who arrived after us were served first. I'm on vacation so I'm not in a hurry, but an acknowledgment and an apology would have beeice. Food was decent. Nothing to rave about. Especially the fact that we were right by the side of the casino and had to smell cigar smoke throughout dinner. BARF!",1
We went to evita and we are season ticket holders. The smith center was piping in a scent to cover the haze that smelled like a funeral with cheap perfume. Every few minutes this was piped in which was disgusting . We left of course. How embarrassing to have to leave because of the smell of the show. That's about it!,1
"I'm throwing up 4 stars completely based on the great Happy hours prices 3.50 tall domestics , beer selection and cool bartenders. I have been here plenty of times but have not eaten anything yet. It's a great location to play some NTN trivia. They usually have people playing and some good competition. Famous Sam's will remain in my neighborhood trivia rotation for quite some time.",2
"This is one of the busiest Chick fil A because it is on Independence Blvd. The staff if friendly and your meal is served quickly. Have used both the drive through and dine in at the restaurant. Always order the Chick fil A Chicken Sandwich, Waffle Fries they are so addicting and unsweetened ice tea. It's like a weekly treat.",2
"Too bad my 200th review is for this place. Typical American ""Irish "" bar. The music selection was good but not right for the environment. Service wasn't attentive. My booth seat was caving in around me. The bathroom was absolutely disgusting. A very small whiskey cranberry was 7. nBottom line, I won't be back.",1
"Stayed here with a bachelorette party, 14 people total! nPlace is not nice at all, almost gross. nI gave it 1 point because the pool is cool, very large pretty. nThe shower in the room made me feel dirty the beds were nasty. But since we spent litle time in the rooms it was ok. nPlace may be cheap but come on, its Vegas, this place needs to step it up!",1
really not that great.when there are like 100 other restaurants to eat at within a 2 block radius. Try somewhere else! And I think it made me sick for 2 days.I have an iron stomach but a couple hours after I ate this I was nauseous and had to throw up a couple times. WTF! I can't place this causal link for SURE.but I'm definitely suspicious. I really don't think it was the boba I had after.,1
This place is delicious. I have been twice with my girlfriend and will defiantly be back. The service is consistently good. The food is made with high quality ingredients and cooked in a wood burning oven. They also have a unique beer selection! It can be tough to find though. It is tucked in the back corner of a shopping center. They do have a small patio that is nice in the spring and fall.,2
"Well, this is just a follow up to the review I wrote yesterday about this market at 2300 E Bonanza Rd. They called me to express their concerns about the incident yesterday, but, to add insult to injury she called me and spoke to me in Spanish! Open your eyes people acclimate yourself to the American language and coulture or go HOME!",1
"What to say about big in japan, in one word BAAAD! In a few more words The food is not authentic Japanese, light years away from perfection usually found in real Japanese restaurants. Ramen soup was too salty and greasy, it really tasted bad. Really a disappointment, go to Ramenya or Kazu, much better culinary experiences than this cafeteria.",1
"I've been to Oyshi a couple times and have never left satisfied! The fish quality was not all that great, the rice was too wet for my taste the service was quite slow! Also the stools at the sushi bar were being really weird and kept sinking down for some reason. Maybe I'll give them another try. MAYBE ! Haha",1
"Quickie cafe type place in the Bellagio. Prices are pretty ridiculous, quality of the food is subpar, and the service is lackluster. I got a salad which was prepackaged and a side of bread which was pretty stale. The menu is super small and the selection is really limited. The only good thing about this place was the ice water with free refills.",1
"Terrible service. They have a short Filipina girl working there now. She will ignore you and not even help you. I ask her for help she looked and just walked away. I asked again ""Can I get some help "" She looked and shrugged her shoulders and walked away again, Go somewhere else that care about customers!",1
"The product was great! We went with the less expensive, cotton Gilden shirt and it was perfect. We worked with Cameron who was super attentive and helpful. When we needed to change our order he went above and beyond to help our group. I would definitely go back. The shirts are great and the customer service is amazing as well!",2
If I could give NO stars I would! This place is so unorganized. I reserved a car to pick up and when I get there they tell me they don't have any cars and ask me to come back. Well obviously I don't have a vehicle since I'm coming to a rental car place. Super unorganized and incompetent staff makes this a VERY irritating situation. I highly recommend to everyone to rent else where!,1
"Even as a Chinese student, I never feel the staff have basic courtesy at all. Every day they serve you with their disgusting faces as if you never pay for your bill. When I see their faces I feel no appetite. This is the Chinese restaurant that I have WORST impression. When friends ask me to go eat Chinese, I must ask whether they are going to EVO. If they say Yes, I say No.",1
"This is very good Thai food.maybe not the best in Pittsburgh, but very good just the same. I'm stuck on green curry, and have been for the past couple of years, so I know that's good here, as are the Prik Khing, Tom Yum soup and spring rolls. I like the cozy vibe here, and the service is always friendly, if not always efficient. I don't live in this neighborhood, but if I did, I'd be here often.",2
"They have a hotel within a hotel. Its called and its separate. It has its own lobby, pools and guest area on a hill that backs up to Camelback mountain. I'd tell you but then again that'd be giving away the store for free and Larry doesn't do that. p.s. Its called ""Canyon Suites "" npps They also have Casitas that are like townhomes. An upgrade is possible if you're Starwood elite",2
"Ok, so I've probably been to this restaurant more than any other place in Phoenix. Every time its truly a great experience. Roasted Corn Pizza absolutely rules! Make sure you go next door, pick out a bottle of wine very reasonable prices and no corkage fee next door and buy some English Muffins for later. When you're done wash it down with some truly awesome gelato.",2
"I called the manager to let him know that I was given the wrong item on take out and over charged an entire meal. I ordered something ala carte, and was given a meal instead. His response to me was 'next time be more specific'. I was a frequent customer of this restaurant, but no longer, will be taking my money elsewhere.",1
"Nice big hotel with comfortable rooms good for the price if you don't want something cheap and crappy but also don't want to spend a fortune on a room you PROBABLY won't be spending much time in other than sleeping . My husband and I didn't visit the pool area but as far as the actual hotel goes, we had no complaints!",2
I went in to get my diamond earings new backs since I keep loosing them and while I waited I looked at new settings for my diamond ring. With the help of Michael I found an awesome and I mean awesome setting. nThe next day my diamond was reset into the new setting while I watched and waited. nA wonderful experience. The ONLY place to go for great jewelry. Just love you guys!,2
"What happened, conditions have been getting worse here. One of my favorite courses as you can walk and price is right but it is becoming unplayable. Greens are full of problem areas and fairways have rows like they were planting corn. Good for practice at best. I hope they can recover the previous better condition.",1
I've been to Vegas a thousand times. And all have been amazing with outstanding customer service. UNTIL I came to LVH this is place is by far the worst place I been to in Vegas . This place is horrible it is so bad I forgot I was in Vegas . WARNING TO ALL STAY AWAY! Spend a couple more bucks and get yourselves a decent room on the strip. This was a total nightmare .,1
"Ate there on Friday night 8 24. The service was outstanding, ambiance amazing and the food was incredible. We had the cod and chicken adobo. Excellent choices. The wait staff catered to every wish and I highly recommend this restaurant. I would say this is better than Nobu where the chef came from. Go here for dinner. You won't be disappointed.",2
So confused by the good rating for this Starbucks. If you are io rush at all then go here. Spent 25 minutes in the drive through and 10 minutes in line on two different occasions. I keep telling myself that they deserve another chance but it is just coffee. They have no sense Of urgency at this location. Go to the Starbucks on 215 and eastern.,1
This is seriously the worst room I have ever stayed in. I walked in and found 2 giant cockroaches in the bedcovers! The next day the dead roaches were in the floor where I left them. Housecleaning didn't pick them up. It's so bad I got another hotel for my remaining 3 nights knowing I forfeited my fees. This place needs to close down.,1
I fwicken ruv v thees praacce. We ooda da foo lik one tim a wek. We ru v v eve ting we ooda. Garlic Chicken with brown rice nChicken Fried Rice nPei Wei Spicy Chicken with white rice nSide of potsticker sauce Seriously 1 time a week for the last 3 months or so. The food is always on point and damn good.,2
Excellent service here. The kitchen sink had a horrible smell coming from it after a couple hours in the room. They had it taken apart and cleaned within a hour. The room was spacious and clean with a low level of noise from neighbors. I would definitely stay again or recommend to anyone in the Gilbert Chandler area.,2
"We decide to stop by last night and give this new restaurant a try. We stood at the counter for several minutes and were not greeted by a host or server. There was a staff meeting in the bar area and they paid us no attention. We left without being acknowledged by any employee. With all of the excellent mexican restaurants in town, we probably wont bother with another attempt.",1
"The pharmacy is 24 hours and generally always busy. I haven't had the best experiences there, but whenever I go it looks like they're understaffed by at least 1 2 people. The last time I was there, the girl behind the counter told me she ""doesn't usually work back here. "" Oh. comforting. Unfortunately I do have to keep coming back because it's so close to my apartment. Dammit.",1
"The spot for ladies who lunch. need I say more? Upscale lunch. Very nice soups, salads, and lunch entrees. Lovely patio. Loud and bustling, full of botoxed ladies in tennis attire. You might feel out of place if you don't have a LV handbag, or even worse, you have no idea what I am talking about. Make reservations. This place is booked every day.",2
Went here for the first time last week. I was SO pleased with the service and the price ! I arrived 10 minutes early for a pedicure and I was seated almost immedietly. The cutest little lady did my pedicure and dud a great job. Pedicures cost only 20 . That's a HUGE deal in my book. Why didn't I come here sooner ?! I will absolutely be back ! PS keep in mind you cannot tip on a credit card !,2
"I have to say a total let down, being from Central Texas born and raised and eating Kolaches for many many years, what they had was OK and wasn't worth the 20 min drive there fosho. And even thou they said they make them in house I don't believe that at all frozen Kolaches I truly believe I was given.",1
"Great for Charm City fans! The wings were great.add some Old Bay! There was a dude across the way enjoying some crabs. Service was kinda slow, if you're a drinker I suggest getting a pitcher unless seated at the bar. Full of life and a friendly atmosphere with multiple flat screens to enjoy the game!",2
Pretty delish! We used to visit this place a lot but we hadn't been in quite a while. My boyfriend insists that we keep coming back for one thing deep fried fluffernutter sandwhich with chocolate dipping sauce. It's amazing and worth the sugar coma we lapse into after eating it. The new owners revamped the menu and we haven't been disappointed yet. The staff is friendly and kind.,2
"As every other review has said the pancakes are really good! You will need to run for like 3 days straight to burn the calories but it might be worth it. I have visited Pittsburgh twice in 2 years and we have gone to Pamela's both times. It's quick, homemade and worth a 30 min wait if you have one. A definite must for your visit to Pittsburgh!",2
Oh How I miss Sushi 99! I would come all the way from America to have it if I could but i live on the West Coast. I lived in Kitchener for 2 years and i had hard time finding good sushi for a on the budget price. This was one of the best place.love their rolls especially the spicy tuna salmon and i absolutely love their salads and seafood pancake.,2
"Great new North Scottsdale spot! The space is beautiful huge patio, really nicely done. Service was awesome, food was perfect. Tried the Burrata appetizer. Simple, fresh and just right. Bucatini and Ravioli for dinner. Both were excellent. Oh, and the Tiramisu was the best I have ever had. Stuff dreams are made of! Really great experience and will most definitely be back.",2
"probably the best hotel in scottsdale. This is where I always suggest family stay when they come into town. The pool slides are amazing, and all free when you stay. GORGEOUS pools. Worth every penny! We were pleased to find how clean and well appointed everything was. And Noh, a restaurant inside, is to die for.",2
"Service was awful, the waiter ignored us most of the time and then gave us the wrong check which by the way was triple ours. My scallops were the wors I've ever had, loaded with sand. Couldn't eat a single one. The waiter was so nasty that I was afraid to send them back he was definitely the type that would have spit in my food. Don't bother with this place.",1
"Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce franks red hot maybe . The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for 1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor heat. The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.",1
"This is one of my favorite spots for lunch. The Pistachio Chicken Salad is excellent and wood fired pizza is great. Really everything is very good and have never been disappointed. Also, the wait staff is friendly, professional, and efficient. Even though it has been there for years, Tommy V's is a real ""sleeper "" pick for lunch on Camelback Road.",2
"They are certainly fast and the tech was friendly and courteous, but there is definitely inflation in their price. The technician showed up 1 hr after my call, which was good. He checked the compressor and told me there is too much freon, and quoted 250 to remove freon. That was not good. At least the guy was courteous and quick, maybe that's factored into the price too.",1
I ate here for the first time the other day and the service was very fast and friendly. They have inexpensive happy hour rolls all day which were delicious! I got a Philly roll and spicy tuna roll and it was actually spicy and flavorful. I usually think spicy tuna rolls are too mild but this one was great. Will definitely be returning soon. Worth stopping in!,2
"Brandon did a excellent job on our part chow chow, Oreo, who is very scared and nervous around any strangers. Oreo has a lot of hair and it was matted in some spots. Brandon took his time trying to ease her nerves by going slow and being patient. Oreo looks beautiful for a very affordable price. We will definitely return soon.",2
"Seriously, what's not to love about this store? 4 Floors of everything m m you could ever imagine. Items ranging in price from a couple of bucks to as much as you care to spend. Oh, and they're totally cool about pics taken inside the store, and even have an M hanging about out front for free photos.",2
My hubby and I came here on a whim because we were interested in learning more about archery. They were able to give us a lesson right then and there. 60 for both of us for an hr. Not bad. The staff is super friendly and the environment is chill. We are planning on going again very soon. Definitely a great place for beginners!,2
"Reserved a non smoking room, was given a ""smoking optional "" room. The smell is horrible. I expected a little nicer room given how fancy this hotel appears but there are cigarette burns everywhere, even in the bathtub. I've never stayed in a hotel room that didn't provide a coffee maker. The bathroom is nice the mirrors are quite kind. The beds are comfy.",1
"If you really love espresso, this place is perfect for you. Their coffee is the best I've ever tasted on the Strip. The only reason why I don't give this place one more star is that it is pricey 3.50 for a fancy shot of espresso?!?! , but the ambiance is wonderful and it's inside one of the most beautiful hotel resorts in Las Vegas.",2
"This was hands down the best massage I have ever had. The atmosphere is relaxing, but not that private unless you have those rooms in the back. The staff is very nice and welcoming. The massage itself was awesome! I had Tina. The massage was great pressure for my aching muscles. I will definitely be here again! Great place, great prices, great staff!",2
"Just returned my car rental to discover I had been charged a 600 authorization charge without my consent! Normally, this charge is 250 as advised by Enterprise associate Bryant , so I question the validity of this bogus charge! Hmm, makes one wonder what this guy was up to?! To make a long story short, I shan't ever be back to this Enterprise location!",1
"The hot green tea was tasty and the service was friendly. The food was questionable. The black bean sauce was good, but the PENANG FRIED KWAY TEOW looked and tasted like something a 5 year old kid could have made by tossing the ingredients together in a wok. The only thing that provided flavor was the chili sauce and I could have added that myself.",1
"What I love about Grazie. 1 It's in the old town area so you can go out after, but not an ""old town touristy "" restaurant which I like. n2 Sunday wine tasting! Usually around 20 and you get apps, maybe 5 tastings and to sit outside. n3 Sausage bruschetta n4 You can enjoy the company of your friends without getting hassled to eat leave. n5 Nutella calzone with vanilla bean ice cream! love love love",2
"such an adorable shop! i got some incredibly cute heart shaped sunglasses here. they do have some pretty heinous things, like giant bow tie brooches, but i can forgive them because i was just so charmed. prices vary wildly. dresses were anywhere from 15 to in the hundreds. however, service is so gracious and kind and everything is so nice that it's worth it.",2
"Worst Thai food ever. I eat Thai food about once every month and i have been to Thailand twice. Vegetable Egg roll had thick raw dough and inside the vegetable had weird taste, fried rice seemed seasoned with only soy sauce and salt and pad Thai was also didn't have any authentic flavor. Service was also slow on Sunday. I will never recommend this place to anybody!",1
"My Brother and I went and ate here for lunch, the server was nice. But the food was very plain and had an awful flavor. We both got a different pastas but we only sent back one becasue we didnt want to look ungrateful. The sausage in the pasta was very good, same with hibiscus tea. My brother ordered a blue moon but it was flat, that was a little dissappointing as well.",1
Great restaurant packed with locals. Ended up at the counter rather than a 20 minute wait for two around the lunch hour on a Tuesday. The mussels with white sauce was just perfect served with crusty bread to sop up the sauce. The macaroni gratin is a fine rendition of mac n cheese. Street parking is a bit tough in the neighborhood but manageable.,2
"I go to this sandwich shop regularly. The size of the half sandwiches are outrageous. The owner Amy is always greeting customers and is overly friendly. I love the selection of bread and buy a loaf regularly. My favorites for toast with honey? Apricot Walnut or Cranberry Orange. Also, the soups are great but I gotta wait till the cool weather returns.",2
So I had the Hotlink Sandwich It wasn't bad I've had better It wasn't Hot really meaning the Temperature of the Meat and the Spicy of the Meat if it was hot in both ways it could have been better. It was sliced different also that not that big of a deal thou but it was different. Wasn't a big fan of the BBQ sauce either.,1
"Absolutely DELICIOUS! The owners are very sweet and have put together an extensive menu, including Pumpkin Curry, which happens to be my favorite! It was well balanced with the perfect amount of spice and big chunks of pumpkin. The owner was so sweet she gave me a Thai Lotus, which is kind of like an Italian Soda it was fantastic! I'll definitely be heading back in there soon!",2
"They've got a tropical forest entrance for starters. You walk in and you take on a jungle atmosphere, mist of the waterfall and all. I love Kokomo's Steak and Seafood which is downstairs. At night, you can look outside your window and they have this dramatic volcano fire show, pretty awesome. Cute hotel and I fancy its location on the strip.",2
"They may have a lot of lamp shades, but they are THE RUDEST people I've ever met! The lady with short hair has a crappy attitude, so does the younger guy. Oh I'm sorry that i have a question! what an inconvenience! oh and did I mentioned they close at 5pm and turned the lights off on me at 4 30?! So rude! NEVER GOING BACK",1
"I just stopped in with a friend to get rice because we needed some and didn't have a rice cooker. I received complimentary eggrolls with it! Took the order to go, but the service was excellent, so I can't wait to try many of the authentic Vietnamese dishes they serve The place is brand new, so it was super clean and everyone seemed friendly.",2
Was on my way to see my sister at the after having surgery she was getting home from the hospital. Ran into Olive Garden to get some take out. Josh was more than helpful and was able to get our food ready and out the door in less than 20 minutes. This was during one of their busiest time. Josh thank you for being so prompt and had such a smile on his face. Well Done!,2
This is definately a huge store with such large sections of just about everything you need for outdoors. The awesome displays of animals make you want to hunting but they do need some dusting off. Since the store is super busy we did have trouble finding some to ask questions. I noticed some classes going on and a cool shooting range.,2
"For as long as this place has been around, it sure keeps a good crowd. DJ's always play a good mix of hip hop and house. Towards the end of the night its a little old school. Always a fun time. Bartenders are always friendly and the door staff is very accomodating. Definitely a go to spot on a Friday or Saturday. Guaranteed a good time!",2
It is a wonderful place for a family to visit. The kids can learn many new knowledges about the butterfly and how to get along well with the natural environment. The 3D movie shows the butterfly migration from Canada to south of America. Three generations of butterfly contribute to the moving. It is so beautiful and shows butterfly of great perseverance.,2
"If this is the best Mexican in Pittsburgh, go to an Italian place. I've eaten food from all over Mexico. There is almost nothing similar to real Mexican Food. Not only is this place ""Americanized "" Mexican food, it's also ""Pittburghed "" meaning very bland for those who like real Southern or Mexican food.",1
Their service SUCKS big time! Waited on the phone for at least 10 minutes asking for a toilet paper. I was put in hold for the longest time.l had to call twice for them to give us toilet paper. I got 3 different people on the phone and they were not friendly at all.They need to improve on their customer service. Would hate to stay here again.very disappointing.,1
"What a great little nugget in PHX. I had the happy hour special burger and a beer for 10.00. Premium ingredients and who doesn't love a good pretzel bun? The french fries were really extra crunchy. I'm not sure which beer I had, I just asked for a light on tap but I really liked it. Great little patio outside, will definitely be back for more!",2
"Very over priced. Paid 42 for 2 large pizzas with 3 toppings each. When I asked what a large pizza cost without toppings, she said ""you didn't order one of those. "" When I rephrased the question, she gave me the price WITH toppings. We ordered on the phone for pickup, and there was no itemized bill.",1
"You really don't need to look anywhere else for painting experts. Timely, considerate and huge attention to detail. They even went to the house many times to paint sample colors and send them to me since we do not live there full time. Not the lowest price but definitely middle of the road and not too high. Thank you for the incredible job. We still look at it and are amazed how good it looks!",2
"Super friendly, great ambiance and the food is delicious. The owner recommended the lamb burger and it did not disappoint. It was a melt in your mouth burger. Also the dolmades were out of this world. Great happy hour and daily specials. nOur server Elly was so knowledgable and friendly. We will definitely be back. nNew favorite!",2
"Not offensively bad, but there are too many good restaurants in Madison to waste your time on a mediocre at best chain like Chili's. Better restaurants on the West Side. Heck, better restaurants at the same mall If you're considering Chili's, go to Granite City instead. It's also unforgivable well, almost.I'll expand on this when I review the Dane to be a bar and grill with lousy fries.",1
" Sigh .disappointed. I was happy to find a dim sum place close to Summerlin, but the food is no where near the quality of the other dim sum restaurants in Chinatown. Steamed Beef Tendon and Baked BBQ Pork Pie are the worst that I've ever eaten. Can't believe I'm going to say this Panda Express is better than this. I feel sorry for the nice staff working here.",1
"One of my absolute favorite places to go late night shopping! It's true that most businesses are a bit more high end and I can't afford them.but most places are buzzing with customers! It is a fantastic place to chill, shop, and munch on huge, fattening desserts at Max Brenner my place to get sugar high and chocolate wasted!",2
"Here for lunch and ordered the Broasted Chicken dark meat combo. Disappointing to say the least, the meat was cooked fine but the size of the thigh was extremely small to the point the leg actually had more meat than the thigh. The fries here used to be AMAZING. Not so much anymore they are typical small greasy fries without the crispness they once had.",1
"Buffet Mass quantities of low quality food. I came here for the daily deal, 30 for all you can eat, all day, all the time until 10pm. Meaning you can come back as many times as you want. As usual the food quality was below standard, typical of most buffets. The only reason to go would be for the great deal 30 all day eats , it is 25 for all day eats during the week too!",1
"Absolutely terrible customer service. The lady I spoke with was ignorant and extremely disrespectful. They are overpriced and lack basic customer service skills. All I wanted was a stone to be set and received flack. If you don't buy from them, they are useless when it comes to fixing, repairing or setting a stone. Save your time, money and energy. Go elsewhere.",1
"Love the Wynn, take a stroll and enjoy the decor through the mall there. My mom and I got tossed at the sushi restuarant there, Okada's it definitely wasn't the best sushi nor was it on my top 50 list but the atmosphere was enjoyable. Actually don't remember too much of that since I most like blacked out after my 5th bottle of chilled sake. Good times.",2
"We had Jessica, she was great! Our 14 month old boy's haircut turned out perfectly and she was very patient with him wiggling around! He had his first haircut at a different location and I didn't like how it turned out, but I read good reviews about this location and Jessica, so we gave it a shot. Glad we did! We'll be back!",2
"This place seemed to have a bit of a slow start, but now it is one of my absolute favorites. The place lacks pretention without losing out on style and there is always a mixed crowd. The bartenders are awesome and some of my favorite people. You'll also find one of the best beer selections in Charlotte.although the sparkling shiraz is more my style ",2
"Great casino and hotel! Lots of food to eat, lots of games to play and lots of music to hear. I love the decor.pictures of bands that played there along with memorabilia such as guitars, jackets, etc etc. This is a happening hotel in the summer where everyone attends the pool parties. Love this place.",2
"I just did the drive through but I thought this food was pretty good. I only purchased a hot dog and fries and the bun was buttered and grilled, yum! Service was quick for something made fresh. Employees were ridiculously nice. While waiting in the drive through, a gentleman who worked there passed out menus. I will be back to try their burgers and of course their custard!",2
"This your local area 24 7 bar and grill, but it serves Mexican food. I love this place reasonable drink prices, great margaritas, and a friendly staff! I'm in here at least once a week for Brad, Jason, and Bridget, they are the best. They are why I show up! If you need Mexican food at any hour, this I the place iorth las Vegas! Dollar tacos at night FTW! damn good tacos for a buck too.",2
I would highly recommend these guys. They arrived as scheduled and didn't cut any corners. The carpet looks fantastic! He also cleaned a kitchen rug that he noticed was dirty for no extra charge! I doubt that you will find any other carpet cleaning company out there that offers this much value for the service they provide.,2
I have been to this location twice and have been disappointed both times. The last time I went to this location I ordered a vanilla latte and which they did not add the vanilla so it was a plain latte. In addition I ordered a croissant and it was not fresh and tasted like it was a couple days old. Needless to say I will never go here again.,1
" 54. That is the amount of money I spent to waste three hours of my day for a half assed job. The worker said, sorry I had to do this in the dark so I hope I got everything. He did not get everything. There is visible dust everywhere. If you don't have the ability or availability to clean the interior after dark, then don't take the customer's money.",1
I was very disappointed with the service as well as the food today. I have been a couple of times before and I have never had a complaint about the place. But today the service was pitiful. I am hoping that it was just an off day and not the way things are going to be in the future. I will give it one more chance just cause I have had such good food in the past.,1
"To be honest, I never stayed at this motel 6. I did, however, drive into the parking lot. After driving into the parking lot I realized this particular motel 6 was nothing more than a brothel. Upon coming to this realization I promptly drove around the back, out the other side, and onto the street. I didn't need to check into this place to know I would have had a bad experience here.",1
"I had lunch there today and the Jive Turkey sandwich left much to be desired, like some cranberry sauce. nI ended up just eating the turkey meat which was very moist and delicious. I enjoyed the mixed greens with balsamic vinegar dressing and left the tomatos and bread. I may try it again in the future.",1
"We love this place so much that we used them as our wedding cake, and it was a HUGE hit. People kept asking us where we got the ""specially made tiny bundt cakes "" and we just smiled knowingly. They were easy to work with and even the catering staff gobbled up loads of them during the party . Hit this place up. You will be SO glad you did.",2
"Lamb burger was outright bad tasted off and charred . We shared and together only ate half. The filet was decent but not 25 worth of decent. Waiter was kind and the ambience is romantic but at the end of the day the food just wasn't that good. There are lots of great byo's in the city and in my opinion, this isn't one of them.",1
"I've been a customer since 1998. Trying to cancel hardline telephone service in Vegas on a Monday evening. I was on hold for 25 minutes. Then the rep tells me they can't cancel my phone service unless I start paying for the modem or buy a new one. Not renting a modem. Between both homes, I'm shelling out nearly 300 per month. Guess I'll go ahead and cancel ALL my service.in Vegas and Phoenix.",1
"I love farmers' markets and Atwater Market is no exception to that rule. I love to come here on a sunny spring or summer day and pick up fresh, local fruits and vegetables. The shops are also well worth browsing. It is a little pricey which is definitely a downside. It is also smaller than Jean Talon which is my absolute favourite farmer's market in Montreal.",2
It's a fun place with a great location at Town Square! They have several happy hours which is always fun cheaper. The decor is fresh it's a busy place that is lively. The happy hour specials are a great bargain the service is always on top of everything. nWhen you're finished shopping or just getting started it's the perfect stop at Town Square!,2
"Mehhhh. It wasn't terrible. but soggy beans, bland carne asada and uninspired pico certainly explains why this place is empty every time I drive by. Next time I'm in the area and hungry I'll just drive the extra 2 blocks and go to Del Taco. My search for a good hole in the wall Mexican place will continue on! It's to bad because I wanted to like this place.",1
"OMG ! nThis place was the shit ! Got recommended by a friend , and im glad we went ! I had the steak and eggs ! Didn't leave anything in the plate ! My friend ordered chicken waffles and I even got try some of his plate . The waffles had cooked bacon on the inside ! The only thing that I didn't like was the 1hr wait . But after we ate we were glad we waited !",2
"Just moved to Henderson and live walking distance to the Gin Mill. I thought this would be my new ""cheers "" bar and was excited when I first walked in. Went to the bar and sat there for about 20 mins without ever being greeted by any of the bartenders, even after making eye contact! Ended up walking out. Don't think I'll ever be back. even though it's sooo close to me!",1
"I wished the food was better sigh . nI also wished that cocktails were better. And, those pastries prepared for the Saturday farmer's market . pretty bad. I used to like then Cafe Soleil pastries, but the apple croissant and chocolate croissant I had recently were just mess. If they haven't figured out already, their competitions are kickin' their butt.",1
"For North Scottsdale this is about as good as it gets for a sports bar. Lots of tv's although they could be updated to high definition. Food is pretty typical sports bar food. Decent wings, overcooked burgers. Your typical sports bar beer selection could be easily improved with a few more microbrews.",2
"Had Cobb salad it was huge, lots of chix, bacon, blue cheese avocado and boiled eggs we had the smokey avocado ranch dressing. Also had the broiled walleye not to impressed , had a few bones a little dry , most of the menu is great, big portions. I've been here maybe a dozen times and the walleye was the only disapointment. Ck it out u won't b sorry",2
"awful. awful. awful. awful. awful. I'm so sick of ontrac. Consistently late. A package was supposed to be delivered by 8pm. It's now 9pm still nothing. I finally complained to amazon and asked them to exclude ontrac as a carrier from now on. Drivers are late, throw packages, make excuses, or just dont show up.",1
This place has the worst service ever. The servers have the worst attitudes. Throwing the food o the table. I get having a bad day but our server should be fired. I always tip always. Not this time. Go anywhere else at McCarren airport. Anywhere else. I don't even want to give a star. They suck and are completely disorganized. Poor poor management.,1
"Let me start off by saying Chase and Mike are GREAT at what they do. They know their stuff and they know how to explain everything to the average person. Their prices are great and the service is unbeatable. They built my whole system 4 12s and after a year of constant daily pounding, they still go hard! Highly HIGHLY recommend Quality Car Stereo!",2
"Poor service and very unfriendly and unhelpful front desk man really soured my first impression upon arrival. They do a lot to upsell shit you don't need so listen carefully and make sure you read your paperwork before you sign. Lots of hidden fees too. I'd suggest you stick to the more well known companies, it will save you a lot of headache in the long run.",1
I would highly reccomend trying the UFO bread. It's basically fluffy bread with a crunchy cookie coating. You will not be disappointed. I almost didn't try it because I wasn't sure about the name. I'm assuming the name comes from the shape if the pastry. I looks like a flying saucer. I'd love to go back and try more of their pastries!,2
"The food was great, although my only complaint against this location is our server named Courtney was extremely rude and only showed any friendliness towards my friend and I because the manager was in the building. First time at a California Pizza Kitchen but the worst service I've had in my life from a waiter waitress.",1
"We had a wonderful experience from start to finish! Our tour guide was awesome! We were celebrating a friends 50th birthday and it was a great time! The food price was reasonable, the food was great and the entire group 25 people enjoyed every minute of it! What a fun and unique way to experience downtown!",2
"This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations! All of the workers are always nice and happy to make your drinks. I generally get the same thing every time, iced chai tea latte, because it's just that amazing. But I wait all year round for anything pumpkin flavored. If you get a chance try their blueberry muffins!",2
"PROS n1. The resto is very small and quaint. The lighting highlights the food yet is dark and red at the same time. Good for those who get the Asian glow from alcohol! 2. The ramen was yummy but nothing special. OVERALL n Cute intimate little place for a date or casual eats. n Not a place I'd rave about, but a good option if in the area.",1
"I'm not so sure why people like this place so much. Maybe because it is ""French "", so therefore the average American tourist thinks its fancy? I came here to get a quick breakfast before departing LV and while the prices were fair for Vegas , the food was fairly unremarkable. Go here if you want a crappy bagel and cream cheese for 3.",1
"Horrible, woke up to roaches in my bathroom, they came to clean the roaches up and sprayed some kind of pesticide in there. I went to the front desk thinking id get another room for the rest of my morning. Not the case they said it should air itself out! didn't even get comp'd , I'm posting the pics of the roaches. Worst way to wake up! Stayed in room 104",1
My wife and I went here on a Friday night on the spur of the moment. Not too crowded yet as they have only started opening for dinner a few weeks ago. Limited menu but everything we tried was superb. Shepard's Pie was fantastic. Served beer and wine. A true neighborhood hangout with a bright future. Dan O.,2
Awful service . There were only 5 people in the whole place n the barista never called for out coffee. Had to go n ask if this was mine. so obviously coffee was cold. Didn't apologize nor offered another coffee. My friend had been there twice before n said got the same shitty service last toe times too. Guess they are not getting our money again,1
Restaurant? You mean they serve food at that place? nWell i guess you learn something new every day! nI see lots of bad comments but i had a blast when i went! The place was on fire! Music was amazing! Whoever was spinning that night Fridays did a very good job! nThe place is spacious with lots of room to go crazy! nLove it !,2
"I was very excited to go to this museum. I ended up more disappointed than happy. Some of the exhibits were really well thought out and thought provoking. However, a majority of the exhibits were elementary at best. nA bright point is that this museum is a short walk from Randyland, a fun and happy stop in my day.",1
"This is one of the best places I've ever eaten. They provide a great atmosphere as well as great food and amazing service. If your in Las Vegas and looking for a great place to eat that is not on the Las Vegas strip don't pass this place up and be sure to ask about ""See Thru Green ""and try the Crab cake Sliders! Love this place. EAT HERE! YUMMY!",2
"The customer service here was great! Was in town for my boyfriends birthday and they made it extra special for him by sending up a card signed by all the staff AND a cheesecake with ice cream. I would stay here again in a heart beat just because of the friendliness alone. The hotel itself was very nice, clean and modern. No complaints here.",2
"Ok it just get worse and worse! Charlotte simply just does not have good pizza Ive tried alot of different places and the pizza is either BAD or just ok. Jets falls in the category of just ok reminded me of a step above little caesars.But i would prefer lil caesars at least its cheap. I wont be eating here again, Might as well just go to Dominos or wolfman",1
"Played the Blue White courses this morning with a group of 30 golfers. We all thought the courses were very nice, fair but not too difficult. Fairways were in very good shape, greens a little bumpy but not too bad. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Most of our group said that they would love to play there again. Thank you to Clay in the pro shop for the excellent service.",2
" 12 Bottomless Mimosas! Really, do I need to say more? nOK, I will Service started slow, but slowly became amazing. Is it a coincidence that I was more impressed with the service after each mimosa? Maybe. The brunch food was good, and the patio is nice with TVs everywhere. nI wish there was better sound on the TVs, and I also wish they didn't allow smoking on the patio. Great experience overall.",2
"The place was nice, although I would have like to have stayed at tropicana wyndham resort where the lazy river was. We stayed in a 3bdrooom. place which was nice . and there's a shuttle that takes you to the strip and takes you back later when you're done. nSo you dont have to drive and have a hard time parking . . . Overall it was a good place to stay at.",2
"We used to love this place for the chicken tacos. Something has changed, there was not much meat on the tacos and they didn't taste the same. One of the tacos had only about a tablespoon of chicken in it. When my husband showed them, they made him a new plate, but stuck the taco back on it without adding any meat. We won't be back.",1
There is nothing like cheering for the home team and the Arizona Diamondbacks have a home here at Chase field. The re tractable roof is amazing. They're able to cool it and make it extremely comfortable even on a very hot day. There are some local food options inside the park as well. I think the Diamondbacks do about the best in the MLB of fan appreciation.,2
"I have been going to dog parks for over ten years. My five year old daughter was literally standing next to me, not on the ground interacting with any dogs, did not have a toy in her hand, had no treats and was attacked by a boxer pit mix. She received many stitches to her face. The owner made no attempt to help us.",1
"Brought in my 11 year old daughter to get a haircut. While the service was fast and the girl did a great job giving her the cut she wanted, I wasnt very pleased with the professionalism. The stylist were talking across the floor about going out and getting drunk the night before. I'm sorry but I don't feel that is appropriate when you have clients around, especially a little girl.",1
"We thought the place would be decent but we were blown away! Meyranie gave prompt and excellent service and was very sweet and patient when we attempted to speak french. nThe beef burrito and veggie quesadilla were very tasty, filling, and presented wonderfully. nWhat a great first meal in Montreal!",2
"4 stars for the atmosphere and live band. Don't come with an appetite. Saying the food menu is limited is an understatement. Avoid the ribs in their Bigger Bites menu. See picture of ribs and my hungry hulk like friend in the blue shirt. However, the manager on duty was really nice and made sure my friend didn't leave hungry. Overall, good environment and friendly staff.",2
This is a great place to eat either on site or take out. We also order often at work and its comes really fast. Portion are good I wish they had tzatziki sauce in their meal especially for take out. Super fast service and they are very friendly so thats a plus. It is a bit pricey for the size meal you get so thats why they didnt get my 5 stars,2
"I received such rude and terrible service through the phone when I called to schedule an appointment from the person answering the phone, they just answered with a ""hello "", they didn't say anything else I had to ask and double check if I was even calling the right number and all she said was ""yeah "" very short with me and no help, I didn't even show up for my appointment.",1
"Aptly named! It is tucked away and uniquely designed. nThe food is meant to be shared FORGET THAT right now, it's not enough, but GOOD. The best thing I found here was the H2O. They put slices of cucumbers in it and I found that really refreshing. I would give it another try for lunch maybe next week.",1
"I am surprised that they have good reviews. nI would say this was my least favorite chinese restuarant in town. nI am trying to think postiviely after reading some of 5 star reviews, but nI cannot forget how orange chiken tasted like a sugar chiken. nI almost thought I was eating a dessert. I don't mind modern, dark, quiet atmosphere as long as the chinese food tastes like chinese food.",1
"One of the best all round sushi places. Great tasting special rolls salmon dynamite is really good and different . Sushi pieces are nice as well and are what you would expect from a sushi joint. Way bigger portions and quality than other sushi places so the value and flavor are hard to beat. Place is decent inside, dark and kinda getting old but not dirty.",2
"We recently wondered in here on a whim and were not disappointed! We split the appetizer platter that included hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli, red tabouli, grape leaves and pita. Fantastic! My boyfriend had the Iraqi kabob while I enjoyed the shwarma plate. Bothe were wonderful. Great location close to home with delicious food and very affordable.",2
"Campus Flowers loves, loves, loves the chocolate croissants! Bought 2 while out delivering flowers and had them both eaten in a matter of minutes. been there once for lunch and had a great sandwich too. Only drawback is that it gets so busy during lunch that the line is usually to the door and then they run out of those awesome choc. croissants !",2
I've been to MAC twice and not one time out of the 10 people they have working the counter do I ever get asked for help! My intentions were to go to lush but we couldn't find it and didn't have much time to find it! I had the worse experience at MAC yesterday. I wish I wore Lanc u00f4me because that lady was attentive and nice! I will never spend my money at this MAC counter again!,1
"Had to be here for work this weekend. The lobby and conference room I was in was very nice always had coffee or water to drink. Everybody was extremely nice and went out of their way to say hello and ask if they could help with anything. I wish I had the money to stay here, but maybe in the future! I'd recommend it!",2
"If your going to give someone a broken glass to drink out of. And they ask you for another drink, you should make a fresh drink. Not just pour it into another glass. Wtf!? This is just bad and evil and also a health department violation. Were you trying to rip my tonsils out ? Or tear my esophagus? Will not be coming back. Get it together .",1
"This place looks like it can use a nice renovation. It's conveniently located near my apartment, which makes it easy to walk to. Employees here can be hit or miss. Either they are extremely friendly or helpful, or they are extremely rude. I only go here if I forgot something at target or if I'm looking for a last minute movie rental Redbox right outside is convenient .",1
"My bf and I went there for dinner after terry fator show. The service was excellent! 3 waiters were waiting on us. I ordered the sea bass, beet salad, chocolate cake, my Bf ordered the filet mignon, scallops, and ice cream dessert. All of them were delicious. The scallops were small and a bit over cooked.",2
"This is one grade above subway.and that might be a tad generous. There is nothing that says I must come back. There delivery is fast because they only deliver within in about a mile radius.heck some kenyan could offer fast delivery for that distance. Tuna was from a can, add mayo, put some sprouts, some cucumber, and a piece of cheese on an okay piece of bread.wait.I could do this at home.",1
"Pretty much the only soul food in the stucco landscape of Scottsdale. The service and food is spot on for all things southern. Red velvet cake and grape koolaid are available here too. If you want some serious southern food, head to Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe Lolo's grandma is Mrs. White . Love the pork chops and black eye peas! Both of these places are a local treasure!",2
"The location is the only good thing this hotel has going for it. I have stayed here 2 times. The room was very clean, as it should be, and the staff were very good. I give it 2 stars because the AC unit is so loud you cant here yourself think or even sleep. This happened both times I stayed there. If you like restaurants to walk to and eat do not go here, there is almost nothing around the area.",1
"DO NOT use this pharmacy! These people are incompetent, especially the ""manager "" Jerry who does not even return customer phone calls. It has been 3 days and many, many phone calls and I still do not have my Rx. I will never use this pharmacy again. Don't waste your time.find a different compounding pharmacy!",1
Definately pricier than what I would pay for in the city but their food was pretty good. Service was quick and simple more like a fast food Korean joint. r n r nTHeir kimchi was typical but still good. Their bulgogi was a bit saltier than what I'm used to. My friend had this omelette looking dish but inside was fried rice which looked pretty yummy.,2
"I rented their meeting space for an event. I was disappointed in how dark it was and how poor the signage was for my event. I understand that the timing of my event didn't help, but it was pitch black and was hard to find the main entrance for my guests. Unfortunately I will not return for that kind of event again. The staff was excellent to work with up to the event and the day of though.",1
"What a let down. My corned beef was great, but the taste was drowned out by the crappy French fries that were soggy and had zero flavor. The slaw was good, but I left the bread and fries untouched on the sheet of wax paper because it was all so unnecessary. Good for people watching, but that's about it.",1
"This place is literally down the street from the house, so it is super convenient for me. Been going to this place for a while now, and their customer service is always top notch. Went here the other day and one of the employees told me that they are closing down this location as of 4 5 2014 . Don't know if this location is still in operation, but I'll sure miss them.",2
"This place is awful. Chips and salsa chips were stale. Waitress slow, totally oblivious to her customers and cared more about gossiping with her fellow waitresses. Music crappy club music no one in their right mind wants to hear the day after in Vegas. I highly suggest going to Lombardi's restaurant next door.",1
"Out of the dozen restaurants I visited while in Phoenix, this one topped the list. I was with a large group and we ordered every appetizer, entree, and desert on the menu. Every single one of these puppies motivated our group to moan and groan like Meg Ryan did in Harry Met Sally. Yes! Yes! Yes! Put this at the top of your ""must try list "" when you come to Phoenix my friends!",2
"My preferred choice for Chinese on the West Side. It's not the best ever, but it gets you inexpensive lunch with sizable portions. If you're ordering from them, stick to the Chinese dishes. The rest is okay but4.uh. stick to the Chinese dishes. I particularly love the Fish with Eggplant, the Crispy Fish, and the Braised Beef with Tofu.",2
Came in at 12 noon. Not very busy but its a Thursday so I don't expect it to be too busy. Ordered the albacore tuna melt. The tuna melt is very heavy handed with relish but light on cheese and Mayo so that was a bit dissatisfying and the lemonade was chalky so I will not be giving more than an average rating.,1
Showed up at 830.all the salsas on the salsa bar were cleaned up.the guy was very very rude. And he acted like I was bothering him on his phone. He had to give me full limes because he already threw away all the limes and wouldn't cut new. The food was cold and packed all to go when some was for there. Have another living social deal but don't even know if I want to use it.,1
Reminds me of the old Downside. Randy the owner came over and introduced himself. Saw people I remembered from the old Downside about 10 years ago. Didn't eat the food. I prefer the traditional bar food they used to have. 5 for a good glass of wine worked for me. I introduced 6 other ladies to the bar. We'll all be back on Thursday night.,2
"Excellent meal! I had pork shoulder carnitas with an excellent wine. They have some interesting cocktails too. I think my friend had an agave margarita? Also tried the watermelon salad which was delicious. Price was just right and the service was very good. Make a reservation for a weekend evening, it tends to get pretty busy. Very nice patio also! I'll be back!",2
"My favorite Chase branch, teller line always moves rapidly, plenty of parking in the parking lot. If you need assistance to the manager will help you call customer service, or straighten out your accounts nI go to Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Chase weekly, this branch is by far the best of the ones I go to",2
"Ok, seriously Starbucks, there should not be visible evidence on the toilet seat that the prior user was. um. having a bad day. Gross. No other comments. That's just unacceptable. BTW after being there at least 90 minutes, I used the restroom again just prior to leaving, and there had been zero cleaning done. NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION!",1
"What a garbage operation. Rude customer service every step of the way, overpriced rooms and they are not even that nice. They also charged us much more than what the front desk girl promised for an upgrade fee, and it took nearly two months to get only a partial refund for their mistake. Never staying here again. Much better Vegas options, such as The Wynn, Encore, and Cosmopolitan.",1
"Came in to pick up dessert! They have some really awesome selections. They usually have several types of cakes, NY style cheese cake, some pastries and cookies, not to mention a huge selection of bagels. It's hard to make a choice, and I ended up getting two different cakes and a black and white cookie. Very yummy! Must try!",2
"I've been coming here for about 8 years and I don't trust anyone else to do my hair! Every time I've ever had anyone else touch my hair I've been completely unhappy. I'm VERY particular. And every time I've gotten my hair done at Altered Ego, I leave happy! The salon is beautiful and relaxing. I love coming here!",2
"I have been coming here routinely for years. You order at a counter and your food is brought to your table. The menu is really varied, the quality is excellent, the prices are reasonable for what you get, and the decor is beautiful for an almost fast food, seat yourself type of place. The staff are really friendly and service is good. I highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner!",2
"Brought the kids to lunch here. They have cheese pizza for 2.99 a slice. I got the pasta special with fusilli, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and sausage. My hubby had the spaghetti with meat sauce. For dessert we had the spumoni which was coated in chocolate and delicious. Definitely a hidden gem!",2
"My girlfriend took me to windsor for my birthday last night, I was very impressed. The look of the restaurant was very clean and modern, the service was incredible. The food was delicious, I got a pulled pork sandwich. The cocktails were also very tasty. I don't usually give a place 5 5 stars, but this place is definitely up there and worth going to over and over.",2
I've been here a couple of times. They are very friendly staff. I would recommend getting a pedicure or gel polish done here. But don't even think about coming for an acrylic set. They don't listen to anything you say let alone acknowledge you. My manicurist kept getting up and walking around the shop or paused to get a candy from the front. Ridiculous.,1
"Not a good cab company to take to the airport. Even when booking in advance they will not give any notice if they caot make the requested pickup time. Calling dispatch after no cab arrived was very unsatisfying, they stated that the pickup time is just an estimate window give or take 20min. and that I should have planned accordingly. What? Thanks for nothing.",1
"For variety in Phoenix, I give this a 5 star rating. It is quite good. The sweet potato fries are a must. The aioli they serve with it is great. The salads are not that great and their burgers are more impressive in their description than their actual taste. The milkshakes are rather icy, not creamy. However, it is still pretty good and its open late.",2
"Excellent place for cocktails, upstairs you can grab some tasty craft brews. I suggest you skip the upstairs after 10pm, though if you are over 30 or don't like the cluby type scene. Even with that the upstairs creates a great environment for people watching. Downstairs prohibition era cocktails that are made with high quality fresh ingredients. Check it out",2
"I went here like 3 times the last time I went to Vegas and it was so goooooddd ! I've never been to a taco place that includes guacamole without an extra cost. This is a real authentic taco place, and it's cool to see them prepare it right in front of you. When I go back to Vegas, this will be my first stop!",2
"My first experience here I saw a sign that read something along the lines of ""always fresh "", so with that in mine I ordered some chicken tenders that were not breaded. They were clearly frozen, not fresh, and completely dry disgusting. My friends were really excited about the pork sandwiches they ordered.",1
"Great fish and shrimp. We ordered the cod and shrimp. Generous portions! The service was great and very helpful. I was confused about the breading on the fish though. We ordered the batter but it seemed like we got the corn meal coating instead . however, it was good all the same. I would definitely make the trip to Maryln's again.",2
"I went prior to the change then after and I don't see much difference. nIf you're going for dinner, expect to be disappointed. Nothing is worth whatever money you spend. nThe only thing I'll give them credit for is they have a decent beer selection. nI would be shocked if this place is open in 4 5 months.",1
Great Greek food! The gyro dinner was amazing and really filling. The only thing that was less than perfect was the service. They could use a few more employees so the one server didn't seem so frazzled. This was not an issue at all because we enjoyed the food so much but I would think twice about coming here more often. Take out for sure next time!,2
"Lots of hype, paid for the 12.00 wash and it came out dirty. This was not what I wanted or paid for. The entire front of the car is still filthy from sitting at the airport. I thought maybe by paying for the top of the line car wash, I'd actually get a clean car. Since I didn't leave the car until we got to the house, I didn't see the dirt. Buyer beware. Check the car before leaving the property.",1
Absolutely terrible customer service. By far the WORST I've ever experienced at any post office. Rude employees. When I called they seemed angry at me for doing so. I am forced to deal with them because they supply mail to my area and route. Word to the wise use FedEx or another carrier. Maybe this review will be a wake up call to these wonderful government workers.,1
"Aimed to be first in line but was stuck finding parking and ended up being third. Now that I vented, this Firehouse is just like every other one, AMAZING! But with one exception, IT'S ON THE EASTSIDE! Met the franchisee and he is a great guy, him and his wife have plans on opening more eastside Firehouses. They're basically eastside Saints at this point. THANK YOU GUYS!",2
"They are complete liar's. They told me that the service call was one price and then charged me much more. BEWARE! Then they quoted me for the job that they were going to provide for 1,000. I told them that was to much and then quoted me 600. I find it ironic how they can change the price so drastic. I decided to use someone more honest.",1
"I've been to many Jimmy Johns around Central Illinois, but this one is by far the best. The restaurant is a great size, so there is always seating and the service is very fast. I mean faster than they claim. I love the sandwiches and will never get tired of eating here. The only downfall is that you have to pay the meter to park in their lot.",2
"My gripe is that when you serve imitation crab meat you MUST let people know. Seriously, there are a lot of allergy sufferers out here and I am one and I do not like having an allergic reaction to something I should not have one to! If you are going to serve nasty fly by night imitation food, I really can't eat there. Sushi is sushi and it should be real and fresh. Enough said!",1
"Only one word to describe Bodega Dirty, plates all chipped,glasses looked like they could do with a good wash and as for the toilets a big hole in the ceiling and I'm sure I saw some mouse droppings in a , as for the food it was very bland I expected some kick but everything tasted the same and soggy, the only thing that took a kicking was my wallet! Very over priced",1
"You walk in and immediately smell cheap burned oil from the grill. Thought it was just a whoops that first time in the morning but no. Every time we've been there. Would never order something cooked on that grill. They make great smoothies and coffee. Have to go to the patio due to the smell. Very unexpected due to their ""healthy "" focus. Staff great.",1
It's a bit mental. In fact it's a perfect sliding scale of mentalness randomness. The top of Leith Walk closest end to town is relatively normal. nThe bottom of Leith Walk is a hive of random activity. nThe walk between to two points is like a tour into the insanity of humanity. Leith is a great place to live.,2
Hey forget what you heard! This bar is beyond awesome with cheap and an awesome beer selection! Bartenders and staff make you feel like part of the family because that's what they are about. And I gotta say their burgers are great! 90s is the shit! Ya it's smokey but whatevvv. You will have an awesome time I'm sure of it,2
I'm in the Phoenix area about twice a month and I always stop at Bruegger's to try something new off their menu. I'm never disappointed its worth the couple extra bucks to not be eating drive thru processed food and the cookies are always fresh and yummy! nI'm loving the new staff and how welcoming they make the shop!,2
"I moved to this area last year and decided to check funny looking Giant Pink Hog shop out! We are sold! I get my bacon and sausage here and my family loves it! It is definitely a treat when we need pork products to get them here! They are usually busy crazy, but it's kinda fun and exciting for this area to have a local shop doing so well!",2
Found La Comida by accident wandering around Saturday afternoon on Fremont with the hubby walking our mutt. patio seating was pet friendly. prickly pear and blood orange margaritas are dangerous! we had 2 each before we knew what was happening. food was spectacular. service was prompt and pleasant. excellent atmosphere. not your typical Mexican food. we will definitely be back.,2
"Made a point to stop by here whilre driving through because of my fellow yelper ratings. Ugh! What a terrible hot dog and brat. Chili dog was just bad and so was the brat that my husband ordered. He absolutely LOVES hot dogs, so for him to lnot even finish eating eat and want to leave to go to i out is a BAD sign. The only consolation is the onionrings which by the way are excellent. What a shame.",1
First time here. It's a burger joint with different size of beef burgers and meats. You can put your own toppings for free. Their fries are potato wedges ehich are seasoned really good. The only I don't care is the do it yourself topping salad bar. I'm a bit hesitant to use it as far as sanitation. Don't know how often food is rotated. At least the burgers are cook to order and come HOT.,2
My husband and I like places off the beaten path. Came across a coupon for this one and decided to try it. It was awesome. Looks small as you walk in but it has a sweet beer garden in the back with nice tables and horseshoe pits. Steaks were awesome and reasonably priced. Great service from the bartender who came all the way out back to serve us. We will definitely be returning.,2
"Everything tasted a bit strange.it was just ok. I had delivery, so after delivery charge and tip we are looking at over 20 for just one meal. The price is too high for the quality they are putting out. The bbq pork was watery, the potato salad had tons of sauce and not many potatoes. The grilled veggies were all grilled onions? Just strange, and I won't be buying from here.",1
"Two words Chicken shawarma. That is definitely not an original thought when it comes to this place but it is that tasty! I am one of the most picky eaters in Phoenix and I am usually very much about ""atmosphere "" but this place ROCKS. If you are new to the valley can't imagine another scenario where you wouldn't have been here already you MUST GO!",2
"Stay away from these people. They are a scam. In advertizing they claim they will obtain competing offers for mortgage loans. However, the scam is that they want to place the loan themselves. They have their own sale people contact you and try to sell you on their loan at rip off fees and obscure rules. You need to steer clear of this type of scam especially in this real estate environment.",1
The food is really good! I do have an issue with the service when sitting at the bar. Its almost like the bartenders would rather do side work than bother with actual customers. I do like the food and ambiance its just hard to keep trying them out and experiencing such below par service from bartenders. The rest of the staff is very helpful.,1
"Terrible, we called to make a reservation and were put on hold after waiting for 5 minutes we hung up and called back. This time we went to the voicemail which directed us to leave our name and number for a reservation, which we did. We left name spelled out and number as well as the time we wanted. We never received a call back but shouted for",1
"Avoid at all costs! The amount you pay for a drink you think you would be able to taste the liquor.but you can't! nMight as well be a virgin frozen beverage! Oh and we got an extra shot, their extra shot was a sex on the beach shot so once again.hardly any alcohol! MY ADVICE? Go to FAT TUESDAYS! That is where it's at. Decent price and you'll def feel the drinks!",1
"Just moved here from FL and absolutely love my ""neighborhood "" barber. I went for a fantastic haircut but they are full service and I plan on getting a shave soon. Super friendly I simply can't say enough about Stanley and his aunt. Cut came complete with a massage at the end which reminded me of my days in the military. Highly recommend this family owned barber shop. Used the 5 Yelp discount.",2
"They were accommodating as I wanted the special baked pasta but without the meat. It was tasty, though one mushroom barely constitutes listing it as an ingredient. The meal delivery was slow in comparison to the limited number of customers. I found the prices a little steep for the quantity quality received. I would not recommend unless you are staying in the hotel and get a discount or points.",1
I was visiting Surprise and needed to complete the 14.5 Open. Walked in the door and was given a very friendly greeting. The owners were very supportive and everyone cheered me on during my working out. I would give them 10 stars and will visit again when I am in Surprise. Thanks Again! CrossFit Surprise!,2
"I tried the General Tso's tofu and it was just weird. The tofu pieces were very small and very soggy because they seemed to be barely cooked. To me the sauce did not taste like General Tso's either. I try this dish at just about every Chinese restaurant I visit, and this was by far the worst. I did however like the vegetable spring rolls, however they were pretty greasy.",1
"Usually I really like this place. Stopped in after not eating all day, and ordered the ""famous "" lobster roll. It took 40 minutes to receive a medium piece of lobster claw on thick Mancino toast. THATS IT! Oh and less than stellar fries, with a cup of cole slaw. I waited with an empty pint glass several times as well.I guess you can't get it right every time.",1
"Why can't this chain take over Roberto's? nA big thumbs up. nI got the junior burrito with beans, rice, carne asada, and pico de gallo. nAhhhh all the great memories of going to the taco trucks in California flooded back. n 3 bucks. That's a great deal. nThe place may be fast food, but it's authentic. I wish they had more locations.",2
"Ok so I've been back here several times. Still love it. Their daily specials are amazing, I love the rotating sides and smoothies. They have a green smoothie can't remember the name that is amazing! I took my mom here for Mother's day and they gave all the mom's mimosas love it. I just wish they weren't so spendy. I'm but a poor college student, trying to eat vegan when I can!",2
"I only go here now for pet products. Best service and great prices beats out the big boxes any day and support local PHX family owned too. Arthur and his family at Tempe feed tack have helped us so many times, they even took back a bag that upset the dogs stomach and suggested another brand that did the trick.",2
"Oh so good and huge! Each sandwich is both tasty and large enough to feed two normal folks for lunch. At the suggestion of the server, I ordered the Kolbassi Sandwich. It came fast and was oh so good! Also free soda refills. Service was good mid afternoon on a weekday, and I enjoyed the whole experience watching the NFL Hall of Fame induction ceremony on the flatscreens while eating.",2
Wow. Where do I start. We walked in 2 hours ago. All we wanted was beer and wings. It took an hour to get 2 of the 3 wings we order. Then after sending back the 3rd wings because they were cooked beyond anything you could eat. They took another hour. Just unreal at how a wing place could not make wings. I am so disappointed and will never come back. Beer and wings should not be so difficult.,1
"I'm sorry, a bar this close to Amos' and uptown that closes at 1 on a Saturday night? Some friends and I had just gotten out of a show at the Milestone and came over for a drink. It was about 5 after 1 and we were informed that they were closed and we should go to the Gin Mill. No problem buddy, I'll do that from now on.",1
I've never been to the resturant but from a delievery stand point.They get the food out QUICKLY. They will tell you it'll take 40 minutes but five to ten minutes later the food is at your door and it's hot off the oven fresh. Over the years I've tried almost everything on their menu and they can do no wrong. The food is great! They have the best crab rangoon and I love their Pineapple chicken.,2
"Lunch may be crowded and a bit slow as they get organized, but at dinnertime last Saturday, the restaurant was empty. I've eaten here twice now and think it's a great find. We had the sushi boat. There was more than enough for two and all of it was super fresh and delicious. nPark right around the corner on the side street. .",2
"A very nice restaurant. If you ever wonder about a good appetizer you've got to try the Spicy Shrimp Eggplant is hands down the best appetizer there! nIt is a little spicy because if the pepper, but it is delicious! I think that the eggplant just adds an amazing flavor to it and your palate will thank you. Try it and thank me later",2
"We have been here twice in two days. Its a pretty nice theater. Chairs are pretty comfy and you cannot beat the price. During the day, movies are 7.00. This is the weekend too so they may cost less during the week. All the workers we encountered were friendly. The popcorn was solid and that's about it. A good theater!",2
I just never know if it's because of my high expectations of what I think this place should or could be or if it's actually the quality of the whole experience but for whatever reason's it never seems to meet my expectations because of it's limitations but I feel most of the staff does a great job it's just that it never seems to all come together. Plus the beer isn't cold enough. Til next time,1
"Went here for the first and last time last night. My husband had chicken marsala and the chicken was so tough you could hardly cut it. My son had fettuccine Alfredo and it was so bland. No flavor at all! My other 2 sons and I shared a pizza. Very greasy and the crust was very hard, maybe overcooked but not sure. Anyways 65 later and we didn't enjoy one thing!",1
"WOW! What an incredible selection! I love they have a bulk foods section.things like tapioca flour, flax seed, candy, nuts etc. nThey have a good produce selection and great prices. They have things you can't find in regular stores like Thai chilis, guava etc. Prices on some regular items are even better than Walmart.",2
"Ok, we must have been drunk our first time there. We went back 2 more times and it was not good. The last time we were there we ordered the sampler platter that we loved the first time. The chicken was pink inside, and not slightly pink. My wife was in a panic that she'd be sick. The clientele all know each other, and you're either a regular or not, and if not, they're not friendly.",1
"I have followed Trish the new owner of the salon the last few years. She is the best and her team and shop are amazing. It is clean, spa like and extremely professional. If you are looking for a true spa experience in a full service nail salon and need a place to escape reality for a little while, this is it! nStop by and check it out, you won't regret it!",2
Food was very good but server openly asked for us to give him a tip.we were giving him a tip by the way. but it wasn't what he wanted. I think his name was Sam so if you get him he'll make you give him a tip he likes not what you want to give him. He wasn't very friendly either as the other staff were. Just beware so he's the reason for 1 star.,1
"Awesome place. Good wine selection. Good unique food items. Beautiful handcrafted jewelry. The wall art was nice but overpriced. This location is nice cause u got in n out, target, Ross, Petco, biglots all right next to it. I found a wine rack for my panty for 100. I had a 15 coupon that you get in the mail when you move. Also signed up for their rewards program in which you get money off booze.",2
Not a big fan. I've shopped here several times but often am unable to find what I'm looking for. I dropped in to buy a small pet bed for my Yorkie and they were out of small ones. I purchased a sweater which was marked XS and when I got it home it was way too big so obviously mismarked. I definitely prefer Pet Smart's much larger selection of just about everything.,1
Mini corn dog me baby! How did I live without these for so long? I love all of the bar food here but the mini corn dogs are my passion. Excellent place to watch the game since there are huge big screen tvs inside. The deck has a fun bar and great seating that will be plenty for all of your friends. Perfect Friday night spot to chill great juke box and fun games to play. Love you Solstice!,2
I went once and was very unimpressed. Since I live in walking distance I decided to go back and just get a quesadilla and a beer. Who could mess that up right? I had to laugh when my corona tasted skunky and quesadilla was so bad I only had one slice. You need to have very very low standards to enjoy this place.,1
"Ah.Sunday Brunch! What a spread.the salads were fresh, the pasta tasty and the meats were incredible. All along side the traditional eggs, french toast and custom omlettes. I love the horsey sauce with the prime rib. The dessert bar was SO crazy good.the creme brulee was SO good it called for seconds! nAnd the Bloody Marys .were to die for!",2
Nice friendly staff and great food. Went to college in Philadelphia and have eaten alot of cheese steaks and hoagie. Liked the twist with the pocket roll. Meat and bread were high quality and tasted great. Already been twice. My son had the Texas Tommy also very good. Sent an email to www.mouthbysouthwest.com and told him to check it out.,2
"The food was surprisingly good, but expensive, as compared with Kyoto a block north. Not the best sushi I have had, but solidly good. I like the decor in the small restaurant where the sushi bar is, but not the bar area. However, this restaurant is VERY, VERY LOUD! Seriously, you can't even have a conversation! I much prefer to sit outside on the patio, or go elsewhere. Sad, but true.",2
"This is a great store with very helpful staff. The customer service gets 4 stars, the pricing gets 0 stars. I bought a pair of Prada sunglasses here for 330.00. I wound up finding them online for 189. I returned them the next day. My recommendation would be to research pricing before you buy a pair of sunglasses here.",1
"I love this place and am a regular! Everyone is so friendly and I do not have a favorite nail technician because everyone dose such a great job! I have my nails done every two weeks gels and I love the selection of colors, I am that person that just can decide. Also, my nails have become healthier and stronger because of the care from the techs.",2
"Wonderful customer service! The servers go above and beyond! The salad bar is delicious. The meat is very good however other Brazil steakhouses I have been to do have a little more selection. The atmosphere is also more laid back and not so hectic, which I loved. Overall the food and the service together are enough for me to make this one my choice!",2
"scary, unless you are homeless. stay away. disgusting, unsanitary, hole in the wall. nmanager is a crazy lady who yells at you and watches you to make sure you dont take any food home. ntables sticky, bathroom is similar to ones you find at a truck stop, pealing paint and unkept. carpet has holes in it and appears noone has cleaned it in a while.",1
sometimes you just want to go to an old fashioned country style restaraunt and order some biscuits n gravy and don't need all the over the top fixins some of the other places put hint hint snooze putting carrots in their gravy realllllyyyyy?!?!?!?! in their dishes. the place serves generous size portions and I am a fan!,2
What a nice little bakery . I had cinnamon roll French toast. I was also very pleased that when I went there to have a mom and daughter time but was there after close the owner let us come in and get our cupcakes to go. That was awesome service in my book. nCan't believe that I have lived near by for over 2 years and never gone in. We now have a new place for little treat.,2
"Some of the best fast food baja available in the Phoenix area. For the price, it's hard to beat this place. This location has received awards for outstanding service and more. The owner and regular employees tend to learn people's names over time, and it's a great little atmosphere for enjoying affordable, tasty food. Great location right off the 101.",2
"They have good pizza deals but the pizza is okay but what really disappointed was the italian beef. The sandwich was too small for the price they charged, which is unfortunate because it have pretty good flavor. The sauce on the pizza is bland as well and beside the crust everyone knows the sauce makes the pizza.",1
So glad we found this restaurant! My wife and I were celebrating an anniversary and we couldn't have had a better experience. The food was excellent. My wife prefers sashimi while I enjoy sushi rolls. We were both very satisfied with the quality of the fish. You must try the tuna belly! We'll definitely return. We both agreed that we prefer Pure Sushi over Sushi Brokers.,2
"Im giving 4 stars because the owner and staff were awesome when it came to customer service. The food though was 2 stars. Maybe it was an off day, not sure but I order a sandwhich and said I didn't want pickle or onions on it. It came with both, which was irritating. The fries tasted like nothing. I will go back because of the service and hopefully they get the food right.",2
Had dinner there 3 23 14 with some my family members the food was not good. My cousin order a screaming orgasum sushi roll a got salad version of what he ordered. So he talk to the owner who was drinking beer at the counter area an the owner him self did not have any costumer edict in response to my cousins complaint. An the waiter him self did not have no edict at all through out the night.,1
"Beach Cafe saved my life. After partying for a good 48 hours non stop it was nice to put a little something in my system. I chose the sausage egg in an English muffin with a side of bacon. I ate as quickly as I could and then tried to pass out just as fast. It worked! Basically, it's a Denny's on Wheels! Thanks Sabrina L. I slept for a good hour or two until I woke up parched.",2
"Ed and his crew did a really good job on our backyard. We would definitely use for further projects! I called at least 8 10 companies and got about 6 bids for the project we were looking to do and Ed was the most consistent in answering returning phone calls, giving a fair price and timely. The end result is something we have been enjoying daily.",2
"this is our senond time last one . the quality of the food is just fair service not much better. anyone who has been to a good deli and comes here only to be disappointed. nyou better go soon, if you dare, because this place does not belong in scottsdale and is not low to be around. nsecondary location with secondary food sorry, but these are facts. marty",1
"Not impressed right off the bat. In a weird location right next to another mattress store. Walking in felt pressure right off the bat. When I mentioned I was just looking, I was quickly dismissed. We are needing three new mattresses and will be looking elsewhere. We suggest anyone else does as well.",1
This is a follow up review. When I found Peter and Pauline I was not well and unable to work. I have been working with them for a few months now and my health has improved significantly. I am extremely thankful to have found them and more importantly I was able to return to work full time. They are both very knowledgable and pleasant to work with.,2
"Ate here during the weekend brunch. SO AMAZING. And for only 33 with champagne, in Vegas? Such a good deal. Had biggest selection ever, with the highest quality ever. My entire group of 10 people wanted to cry when we were full and couldn't eat anymore, because there was just so much more delicious food to try!",2
Really amazing food! I got the turkey avocado with homemade chips. REALLY GOOD. The service was great and the way the place is so cool. Get ready to go back in time when you walk in. You can enjoy the 60s and 70s memorabilia while eating. The environment was awesome and the detailed interior design makes the whole experience so interesting. Super impressed over all. I'll be back !,2
"J'ai ador u00e9 le concept de fast food v u00e9g u00e9 et la place est vraiment agr u00e9able ! nEn revanche, un peu d u00e9 u00e7u par les plats, franchement pas tr u00e8s goutus. nMon sandwich Tempehtatio' u00e9tait vraiment pas exceptionnel. nLe v u00e9g u00e9panthere de mon amie u00e9tait bourr u00e9 de mayonnaise. Je passe mon chemin, dommage.",1
"We came here for the daily Cheese and Wine Tasting. The service and atmosphere were excellent. Top notch. However, the wine we tasted wasn't good. The bottles had been open a few days prior. The cheese was good, it portions were tiny. Each portion was about the size of two half dollars. Not a great value.",1
Where els can you go for 2 slices of pizza and a drink for under 5 bucks? This place was awesome 20 years ago when I came here for lunch in high school and is still awesome when I bring my kids here now. I just recently had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was better than i was expecting. This is also the go to place if we are watching football or just chillen with friends.,2
"Love this place. I've been three times, once for pizza, then penne in vodka sauce, and most recently spaghetti with meat sauce. Absolutely everything is made fresh and I can taste every bit of it! The sauces are fantastic. Next time I'm trying the pesto. I don't even like pesto, but that's how much I enjoy the food here. The service is great too. Very friendly and warm staff. Feels like home.",2
"No skim milk?!? I don't think I'm the customer this place is looking for. The actual shop is nice. Great, lovely open space. But crazy expensive artisan gourmet coffee isn't for me. No warm and fuzzy vibe from the staff. Just rude sidelong glances when I asked about skim milk. I would only return if I find a coffee snob friend I really wanted to impress.",1
"We absolutely LOVED the Teppan here, Primarily because of our Chef, He was AWESOME!. I don't think i've ever had a Teppan chef who was as involved with his patrons as ours was. I can also say I have never had SAKE directly squirted into my mouth by a Teppan Chef lol. The food was good too and I would totally recommend the Mushroom tempura. We will definitelt be back before we leave AZ.",2
"I have tried the pizza several times and find it rather bland. Recently I tried the breakfast sandwich to go, they put two huge eggs on it and a lot of bacon but the container was filled with grease and liquid which made a soggy inedible mess. The service is always friendly though so I keep giving it another try.",1
"This place is freaking amazing. My boyfriend grew up eating there so he craves it from time to time. I've only eaten inside once and we usually get take out but it's so good. He gets the red chili burro and I get green chili. We also order a cheese crisp folded and side of chips and salsa. Yes all in one order, I seat half the next day. Highly recommend this joint.",2
"Finally done shopping going here. The staff is horrible rude and unhelpful, not once but 3 times I had issues with the hairstylist. I have also shopped here a lot but after being asked to leave when I had my hypo allergenic dog I was over it. Thank you Kidville I will buy my daughters clothes at Nordstroms and Saks.",1
Caution. Don't get your dark colored vehicles washed here. Wipe down clothes must be used over and over again without washing them as streaks are visible all over the vehicle. Seem to transfer dirt from one vehicle to the next. No pride in job or customer satisfaction. Go somewhere else or wash yourself you will be much happier with the results.,1
"We were very excited about this place and unfortunately were very disappointed. The food and service was below par. Awesome beer selection though! Food was SMALL portions and very bland. Our waitress forgot two items and took about 30 40 min for food. Will not return maybe for drinks at the bar, but that's it. It's a real bummer.",1
"I was glad to see a breakfast restaurant open around the corner from me. Since it's opening we've eaten here 3 times breakfast only . I can't say I'm really impressed. The service is good, very warm welcoming but the food is just okay. The price doesn't jusify what you get. I'd rather make the drive and get a better tasting breakfast for less money.",1
"Considering this restaurant serves every kind of food imaginable curry, sushi, meatloaf, cotton candy , it is quite tasty! I went here for a group dinner on a work trip and while, the food was good, the main attraction was the cocktails. I'm not sure that I would came back for the food but I will definitely be back for the cocktails!",2
"Dont buy from bestbuy. You will be ripped off with bad attitude.all they care is try to do more sale. I tried to renew my phone contract over the but they didn't do it right and j have to pay for 2 carrier at the same time. And they said to my friend another time when she went there "" if you didn't knoe too long then I just cut off and do the next customer. "" with the rude attitude.",1
i went there since its pretty close to the house and my husband has gone there more than a couple times. i ordered the egg flower soup and won ton soup i was sick and need soup to comfort me . the egg flower soup was nothing special but the won ton soup was super special. there was seafood and giant won tons. would go back for the won ton soup 9!,2
"The food was pretty bad. My soup was too watery. My ice cream sandwich tasted funky. Everything was priced extremely poorly for the quality in my opinion. I paid 30 for a bowl of soup and two slices of ice cream sandwich. Wtf. At least everything was edible? If you're in the right seats, you have a great view of the Bellagio fountains though. Only other plus side, it's open 24 7. Go to Earl's.",1
A little confusing though because I paid for an exterior wash only but I paid for the 8 one vs. the 5 one but then you move into the same lane as everyone having their interiors cleaned and the workers are confused and you're confused. The employees are nice though. Maybe next time I will just pay the 5 and be on my way,2
"Madison, WI is not necessarily known as the epicenter of great Mexican food. However, Casa de Lara is a solid option if you are really craving some. While the service won't knock your socks off, everyone is nice and the food is pretty darn delicious. Insider tip Try one of their margaritas. Then have another. Repeat this process until you leave with a smile on your face.",2
"Drinks were unique and delicious, but like everything in Vegas, wildly overpriced. The food was not memorable at all. As we were eating, we agreed that the high ratings must come from people who enjoyed the atmosphere, which was nice. We tried 5 or 6 dishes, including the famous duck salad. None of them were worth repeating. Tasty drinks and great service, but food is grossly underwhelming.",1
"You get a very nice room at a reasonable rate, and it's right on the edge of the quad. Book early you're lucky to get a room if there's a football game or other special events happening. Even without special events, it is sometimes full. Downstairs, the Illini Union has a dining, a bookstore, pool hall, bowling, ATMs, and more. Plus free parking and Internet access.",2
"This place is good for what it is. A cheap, mock Asian food place. Don't come here expecting gourmet or authentic food. Sometimes it's the cheap overly Americanized stuff that's the best. The chicken teryiaki bowl is great. The sauce is sweet and they really put a lot of it, I just wish they would put more chicken and veggies.",2
"I like Takamatsu for its fresh fish and all you can eat menu. The manager head waiter is very nice and remembers you as well as what you like. The sushi portions both nigiri and rolls are generous, and not just with rice. I especially like the Yummy Yummy roll, which features shrimp tempura and crab, cream cheese and smelt roe. It really is yummy.",2
"Though I'm not especially sad about leaving Vegas for the Bay Area seriously, no competition whatsoever , I do get a bit choked up when I ponder the loss that I've suffered io longer having an East Coast Pizza nearby. It was simply the closest thing to NYC pizza of the Famous Ray's ilk that I've had outside Manhattan. If that's your thing, I highly advise a visit.",2
"Excited about a new breakfast place and had to try. Very disappointed! I had the ""Sandi "" the eggs were cold and it was extremely dry with no flavor. Ordered the carrot muffin too which was never brought to our table we had to chase it down which was stale and tasted like cardboard. We were not given water which I would think would be a given. Overall not good and I won't be going back.too bad!",1
"Last August I used Bulwark moving for what most people would say a not so easy task. I moved all of my stuff from Phoenix to Glendale 1, and 2, up 3 flights of stairs! Bulwark was extremely helpful with my difficult move and such awesome people to have hired. Good pricing, and hard workers. What more could you ask for when moving? They will forever be my moving company! Thanks Bulwark!",2
"Stayed here 3 nights. Checking in was a breeze and the service was great. I was expecting the room to be a little bigger, but overall it was nice. I forgot my contact lens solution and toothbrush and they brought it up to my room immediately. A couple days later I decided to recheck my hotel bill and saw a mistake, I called them an they fixed it.",2
"Update went to nektar again the other day hoping they'd prove me wrong about their customer service skills and I probably stood in front of the register for about 10 minutes while 2 girls behind the counter talked and completely ignored me. Not even so much as a ""we'll be with you in a moment. "" Just pretended I wasn't there.",1
"Once again I gave ultrastar another chance, we went to see texas chainsaw at 8 15 neverything was good until the movie started. I noticed there projector light bulb was flickering so everytime there was a scene with a white background the screen would shutter, I noticed this issue because I used to work for a major theater chain for 5 years.",1
"Delicious! I've never really had Hawaiian food before, but this was wonderful. I had the chicken katsu and it was SO good! The rice and salad were both excellent, and my boyfriend enjoyed whatever he ordered. We even got a free dessert. The staff is super friendly, the atmosphere is fun, and everything was scrumptious. I highly recommend Moki's, and am excited to go back.",2
"The rooms were nice with an empty fridge SubZero! to put whatever you want in with no overpriced mini bar, a Wolf two burner range, free wifi coffee maker with good coffee to boot all included in the price. This is a non casino and no smoking establishment and I love them for that. It was a quick walk down to the strip. The bar is small but great service.",2
I suppose that living 5 hours from the nearest oceans makes us suckers for these things. It is a nice enough place to take the kids on a lazy afternoon but at these prices you would expect more.maybe staged shark attacks or talking Orcas. The place has a ways to go. They kind of made the ocean boring.,1
Reminds me of Alice in Wonderland in here! Super cute. Good food. Can't remember what I liked best. I'd recommend getting a plate full of desserts for everyone and sharing it because they're not that good. They're super cute though! Could NOT bite into the candle apple. Thought I was going to break a tooth or something,2
"Best prices and great service! Stopped Christmas Eve, store was very busy at the time. Received assistance within minutes, picked selection, great price on the wine. Extensive selection of wine and spirits to pick from. Checkout was fast even though they were very busy. Definitely the spot to hit for wine!",2
"Not sure if it was an off night but my 2 beef taco plate was subpar. The tacos were on the skinnier side than what I've had at other locations, the rice had chunks as if scraped from the bottom of the pot, and everything was super salty, more so than usual. Will try Faustos across the street next time for my Mexican food craving.",1
"Terrible service. Very disappointed because I had heard great things. Made a reservation for 745 but still had to wait for 35 mins. Hostess was extremely rude, her name Christina. I was talking to her and she was purposely looking over me and not responding. Not a good start to dinner and not impressed with customer service.",1
Fat Heads has really great burgers but I have one issue. I don't like french fries but nearly every sandwich comes with them. I kindly asked if I could replace my french fries with something else and they told me no. I really find it hard to believe that inflexible restaurants still exist in this day and age.,1
"It was not like I remembered, this used to be such a nice place to go. Not that it's totally bad but I was shocked to find the glass entry doors covered covered with crap, trash all over the place and customer service in some of the food service areas non existent. The rooms were nice and quite comfortable. I think I will stay elsewhere next time I am there.",1
"Food was meh and the service was nonchalant at best. No booster was offered for our small child, specials were not explained, staff was cold and sour, pasta was not fresh, we were not ""allowed "" to get a doggy bag for the dessert since it was ""free "", i.e included in the kid's menu or table d'h u00f4te wtf?! , and they complained we didn't leave a tip!",1
"I'm updating my previous review., as it seems like the best staff have all left. The last time I went, Katie made me feel like I was holding up her day getting my legs waxed. She gave me two minutes to look them over in the dark, so I didn't discover all the spots she missed until I got home. My hair stylist and massage therapist don't work there any more, so I have no reason to return.",1
This place should be called Zabas Mexican't Grill. I just paid 20 for three flavorless tacos and some gross nachos. The whole time they were making our food I was hoping there would be some magic in the taste because it looked really sad. I think I ate 10 of my nachos before I had to give up. They gave my son the wrong kind of tacos. He ate about 50 of his food before giving up. We won't be back.,1
"Brought the car in for a synthetic oil change and after they started the service they told us their credit card machine ""wasn't working. "" So I ended up walking around the mall trying to find an ATM to get enough money to pay for the service. You would think they would be apologetic, but not a friendly face anywhere. Back to Jiffy Lube for us.",1
I honestly believe that there workers are high on drugs when they take orders I've been there 3 times and every time they gave me the wrong order! I waist more money on gas going back to them to get the right order than the amount I spend on my meal. How they get there jobs befalls me?!?! They need to retrain there employees horrible location,1
"Store told me one thing and Cox told me another. They really don't know much about customer service. I have had all kind of issues. Internet, TV and then I find out the whole thing would of been cheaper if I got a phone and bundled. Of course that means I have to buy a phone. What a monopoly. Satellite here I come. Stay away from COX in Las Vegas people, it worse than playing the slots.",1
"I love how whenever I come here, I always leave pleased. My nails look perfect and they last for a long time. Also when you get your nails done, you want a nice massage. This place will massage you for ten minutes each leg. The service is always quick and fast and I always can get in. I would recommend luster for your next nail destination.",2
"hmmmm. idk. is it a gourmet hot pocket? i had the bangers and mash. i probably would have liked it a lot more had it not been hot pocket style. the gravy was great. there wasn't a lot of sausage and i love the grilled onions we also split the pb j and that was alright. i liked the rasberry jam. but idk, the whole wrapping everything in a dough sorta turned me off. not sure if i will go back.",1
"Stopped here for lunch and ordered almond chicken and also egg drop soup. The small lunch bowl has about 1 "" of low grade grisly chicken, almonds and celery, the rest is rice. AFTER I told her I don't like rice. The soup is odd, with tofu and canned mushrooms. I smell some delicious garlic but I'm not tasting it anywhere. nSuper hot food and friendly staff.",1
"Found this place through reviews, wasn't disappointed! I've spent the last 5 mani pedis trying to find a new regular spot to go to. This is by far the best place I have been in Phoenix! I got a gel manicure and pedicure and 2 weeks later my nails are still in wearable shape. The massages add ons are also reasonable and worth the price. Huge color selection.",2
"Well for all the hype and advertising, what a major disappointment! nYes the crust is thin, but not tasty. We ordered the mushroom and they scattered the pie with some shaved very thin. They use about a tablespoon of tomato sauce and about the same amount of a tasteless cheese. Dominos has better pizza. And it's expensive. I'm from Los Angeles and every place here is better.",1
"This place is gross! First off the rooms smell, the towels smell and the carpet is filthy! One of my pillows was dirty and there was a hair on the comforter. It feels more like a truck stop then a hotel in Scottsdale. Couldn't wait to leave! I don't understand these other reviews, makes me think there fake!",1
"Delicious chopped salad. You Must order this salad! It is the same as citizen public house but waaaaaay better. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think the menu could be better. It has staple items to order which it does amazingly like the mushroom dish, the chopped salad, and a few others but overall options are limited. I prefer it for lunch personally because of the chopped salad.",2
Bought a Keurig here the other day for a friend of mine. It was such a good deal! The coffee machine was 30 off AND I was able to use my 20 off coupon on it. I love the coupons they send out and the variety of items you can use them on. The staff are very helpful and the store was clean and organized,2
Don't expect a lot when dining here. Sort of a you get what you pay for kind of thing. Main reason why I only gave one star is because I was shamed for asking if they gave military discount. Fine if you don't but don't make me feel bad for something so simple! I had no idea asking for military discount made me look poor! Boy the stares I got from these people.smh.,1
"They close earlier than most large book retailers, 10pm . Major bummer for those who like to hit up a bookstore late at night instead if the club! Lol. It seems I usually can't find what I want at this particular location. It's in my area or I'd probably pass on it altogether. This review is location specific. I do love bookstores in general.",1
"I went in the other day to get my fishing pool re spooled with line. I had went there before and either the spooler messed up or the line was just bad quality. Either way, the manager made it right for me, his name was Alex. He let me pick out better line at a discounted price. I didn't have a receipt, he was just working off of memory or good will.",2
"Best vegan breakfast I've had on the strip. Terrace Point offers a great vegetarian vegan menu, much bigger than most places I've been to. The spinach artichoke dip with cashew cream is amazing, and the French toast was phenomenal. Also unlimited mimosas for 19? Definitely a place worth coming back to.",2
This is seriously the nicest gym I've ever been to. They have a ton of classes available all hours of the day. I did WTF with Missy for a few months she's a great instructor but she's leaving this week unfortunately. I love everything about this gym I just wished they had full sized towels or small towels for people to use.,2
"My first experience with this place was on a friday afternoon for lunch. All my other friends had the lunch buffet and I ordered off the regular menu. My meal was a large portion and good value, but not even an hour after eating there I got very sick. Their chicken gave me food poisoning, I don't think I will be back soon, every time I drive by and see it I have bad memories.",1
"Wow, great crawfish. It comes with a few potatoes and half a cob of corn. The corn tastes like spicy garlic buttery heaven. I opted for a bowl of rice to accompany the little critters, and ended up pouring Hot n Juicy sauce all over it, the sauce is so good! They have good shrimp, too. Can't wait to come back to try some more of their seafood delicacies.",2
"Okay, so, my best of friends lived next door to this place for a couple years and would always tell me that Someburros was just ""Okay "" at best. On the weekend before they move away, I come to visit and they finally take me here. I feel like my friends were holding out on me, Someburros is delicious.",2
I used to frequent this cafe because I work in the building. The food was good and the staff was very nice. It now has new owners. 8The old staff is gone. The quality and quantity of the food has diminished greatly for the same price. The owners ignore their customers and have their adult children working the cash register who are very nice. I don't eat here anymore.,1
Sorry to say this place was pretty bad.the noddles are like the rameoodles but I think the ones in a cup would taste better! I ordered the wontooodle soup and was surprised they had shrimp in them. Maybe they were shrimp dumplings tossed in soup. The soup itself had no flavor.my mom got duck and wonton soup mixed. The duck was full of fat and bones. I would not come back.,1
A great place for a Friday night fish dinner. The baked fish is my favorite. The prices are very reasonable with good drink specials. The wait staff is very friendly. Ask for the hash browns with cheese and onions and you won't be disappointed. They can accommodate large groups and are willing to make special orders. Give them a try and you will walk away satisfied.,2
"The best steak I've had. Juicy, and cooked to perfection. Bone in rib eye more like cave man rib eye. Delicious steak flavor and bite no bs flavoring just meat at it's best. Great specials too but I think I'll stick with bone in rib eye and complimentary salad bar no need for sides. Pretzel bread also amazing",2
"The food is great, but Genesis pronounced heh neh sis for you gringos puts the food to shame. Tonight she is wearing sassy red lipstick that is TO DIE FOR OMG. Best bartender ever. Ask her for a tres amigos y gordo next time you're in. She won't make it for you, but she'll most likely flash you that bajillion watt smile of hers a worthy consolation prize indeed.",2
"Our kids just love this place. They are 2, 2, and 5. Everytime we've been here, they fall asleep in the car on the way home. They close at 2pm on Saturday and Sunday, just wish they were open later these days. The crew keeps the playground clean and in good repair. It's on the daily request list from our kids.",2
"My wife read about Phrank's in a magazine on a recent trip to LV and insisted we try it. Am I glad she did! Her fish tacos were excellent, but my Adobado torte was spectacular, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Had a nice chat with Phrank too as there was no one else in the place. Highly recommended.",2
This place is next to the check in lobby and opened 24 hours. I had the club sandwiches for late night dinner. The portion was large. The service was not good. The host surely took his time to have me seated when there were a lot of empty tables . It also took a long time for my server to come. Menu options are basic and limited.,1
"I love Mandalay Bay! From my experience, I think it is the best hotel in Vegas. It's not only stunning inside, but it has it's own beach! What is not to love. Although Vegas has so much to see. I could literally stay at the hotel and satisfied. Private cabanas, awesome tub in my room, great food, amazing service. I think I pretty much said it all.",2
"I love walking around here and seeing all the shops and the Trojan horse and eveyrthing. It's nice to wander and people watch. This place is confusing all hell tho. We were walking around and somehow got completely turned around and ended up somewhere we've never seen before. We finallly found a door out, tho, and managed to get back to where we started ",2
"Awesome food,service and atmosphere! Request Eric for a guided excellent dining experience. I had the petite Filet omg the seasoning was crispy, cooked medium rare just melts in your mouth. Start with the Ravenous Pineapple for a refreshing beverage and don't miss out on the Buttercake! Hubby liked the Seabass and enjoyed the Mambo salad. A DEFINiTE return in the future",2
My friend had a car accident and they worked with her to keep everything in her budget. I was so impressed with the service that I brought my '01 Saturn in to get the fan fixed. They did everything in a quick time and even stayed open late on saturday to get me my car when I was running late. I would go there again.,2
"Went today with a friend that had never been, it was horrible. I have never asked for my back and today I did! Everything was closed or empty. So disappointing! Ive been there several times and have had a great time as have my kids. I was embarrassed to show this place to my friend. The new museum is to open up in October, I hope it's worth our tax .",1
This is a favorite in all the world. Everytime i come back after being elsewhere I dig it. Sometimes the roof opens and you see the moon or stars which in vegas is kinda hard to do if your not in the desert. Great dance floor and the outdoor areas are fine in a super fine way its the plexiglass you can see all of vegas thru plus the crowds always fun.,2
"Eh.nothing special here. If you are craving REAL mexican food with real cheese stay away from Agave. I came here because of the yelp deal but it never looked that great to me driving through the shopping center. Im not a cook but I can easily whip up the menu and it would taste just the same. I guess i call this bar food or the .? No, Kraft Mac n Cheese of Mexican.",1
"Nora's has some of the best Italian food in all of Vegas. Their prices are reasonable. The food quality is good. Your 1st basket of garlic bread is free 1.50 per basket after I recommend a reservation as the place is ALWAYS packed. Good quality food, good service, good prices. I have been a customer of Nora's since 1994! Good luck finding better Italian food in Las Vegas!",2
"The appetizers and the staff were probably the only good part about this place. The wife and I went for the first time. and the last. Their signature ""Pasta Tagliani "" was incredibly bland and waaaaay overcooked on the chicken. Being someone that cooks Italian food and has a love for the culture that comes with it, I can tell you now that Olive Garden is 1000x better. and that's americanized!",1
I have been here 2x since moving down here from cali bay area. I am a coffee snob and I really fit in here. The staff is very cute and helpful. nThe people in the shop remind me of the bay area. nI drink americanos and the beans being used are very robust and smooth. nThe menu selection is nice for the food fair and I really enjoy the general atmosphere. I strongly recommend this cafe! Donkey ,2
"Went here one evening on the suggestion of my spouse who had been there before. I ordered the roasted chili burger special, and was extremely disappointed when an obviously frozen hockey puck burger with one thin slice of chili showed up. Waitress handled the issue fine, and I must say the ahi tuna salad i ordered as a replacement was wonderful, but the food was hit and miss in my case.",1
"Food was great. Service was a little cold, and left me needing water. Loved eggrolls and most other apps, including the cucumber salad. My kids 2 yo and 4 yo loved the Udooodles with no spice. My pad thai with tofu was really good. The shrimp toast was a little greasy, and we were thirsty. I will definitely be back though.",2
"The food was ok. Preparation left something to be desired. Service was slow, aloof, and really not up to expectations. They even failed to bring silverware with the meals. The meat was not cooked to the requested level. We had high expectations, but left disappointed. There are far better restaurants to choose in the area.",1
AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS! n 12 for a Fireball Shot? Where are the Strippers? nThis place has gone downhill since it opened and is a joke amongst Vegas Locals. nDrinks are 25 more than even the most expensive Strip Clubs. It would be different if the shows were free. nSecurity Wanding Pat Down before entering? Really TSA? Avoid this place at all costs!,1
"So I've been back a few times since my original post. I must say that pretty much all their sandwiches are great. Just pick the flavors ingredients that you like most generally you wont be disappointed. My new favorites include the Jamaican Jerk, the Italian, and of course the original. Happy eating everyone!",2
Very very bad service !they send out a pre approval letter for an auto refinance saying you're pre approved they waste your time don't call you back when your not approved and it just sounds like its a gimmick ! anybody gets any pre approval letters in the mail from West Star credit union don't fully believe that you're actually getting preapproved for a refinance!,1
"Booze, snacks, and hangover remedies. I wanted to check out a CVS off my usual path. I was dogged by security and staff through the entire store, until they finally herded me out with only two of the items I came here for. So much for a fun browse that was going to allow me to skip the trek to Target.",1
"We went to the Oddball comedy fest and decided to give STRIPSTEAK a try. My wallet and I both wished we had chosen a different restaurant. Wait time 3 Our reservation was at 5 30 thus were seated quickly, but the wait for the food was a bit long nService 4 nFood 2.5 nPrices 1 If I could give it a 0, then it would be a 0. The food was not worth the price ",1
" ""A Night at the Roxbury "" of Japanese restaurants. The music is so loud, unfortunately it's the main take away. Perhaps it's not as bad on any night other than Friday or Saturday for dinner. It's a beautiful space and the food is pretty good. I would give them another try if it weren't for fear of leaving deaf and hoarse again.",1
"NYPD is the old standby. Always consistent always good. I recently had the Italian beef salad. It was different, but good. The wings, salads, meatballs and most importantly pizza are all good as well. The service is always good. We have been going to NYPD since they opened their first restaurant on Via Linda it is now something else . You will never go wrong at NYPD.",2
"Easily the worst Jamacian Oxtails ever. The ""rice and peas "" was watery and the cabbage was bitter. I've been to multiple Jamacian restaurants from Atlanta to Ocho Rios, sorry but the flavors weren't there. Also tried the ""succulent "" ribs, different, and the beef patty which was ok. Sadly, the most enjoyable part of the meal was the plantains. They were excellent, nice and crispy.",1
I have only came here once was disappointed. The prices were too expensive for the food. The food tasted like I could have gone to a fast food place the fast food probably would have even tasted BETTER than the food here at Hamadas. The service was decent attentive but I would never come back here again.,1
"Wirklich ein h u00fcbscher See in Karlsruhe Forchheim, den ich weniger zum baden als zum angeln besuche. nDas letzte mal gabs sogar einen kleinen Hecht, der aber leider auf Grund des Mindestma u00df dann doch wieder wieder schwimmen durfte. Ansonsten hat der See auch einen guten Besatz. nMorgens hat der See eine ganz eigene Romantik einfach mal die Bilder ansehen.",2
I came for a late dinner tonight at 9 50 PM and I was greeted by Bonnie. She was super friendly and knowledgeable about gluten free options. She even changed her gloves and washed her hands. Thank you Chipotle for having lots of options that are gluten free and furthermore thank you for educating your employees.,2
"As they say here in Montreal, ""nouvel administration, nouveau concept. "" Totally new management, and now this shop is tight. Excellent, prompt service, and very decent prices. They specialize in fixed gear bikes, but are fully capable of servicing three speeders, road bikes, touring bikes, etc. Nice team. Chill atmosphere. No pressure tactics.",2
"So disappointed with the changes at Hilldale. Why would you want to make a mall outside in Madison WI? I used to love being able to browse in small shops without worrying about the weather. Sadly, many of the small shops that I enjoyed have moved or gone out of business. nIt feels like a ghost towow.",1
"I just moved to Charlotte from San Diego, and have been looking for a decently priced sushi with good quality. K.O. is moderately price and the sushi is fresh. I like the fact that it is a take out place. We had the Dragon and Eel roll as well as the seaweed salad. Everything was great and I will defiantly go back soon.",2
Was so happy that they were open early on a Sat. morning. I'd just eaten breakfast nearby but couldn't resist stopping in after hearing about this place. The lady at the counter is so very nice. I brought home a guava and cheese empanada and a piece of tiramisu. Both were out of this world. This is definitely a place that I'll revisit often.,2
Always a long wait to see the doctor. Today waited an hour and a half with no one updating me with ones going on or an apology. Went to get a refund of my copay and still no apology or even an option of let me see how much longer. Becky may be great but the front staff will keep me from going back. Never happy with the staff every time I've gone and this what the icing on the cake.,1
"This place is great. It is the best pho I've had in Phoenix and it is cheap. You can have a meal, plus tip, for less than 10. My favorite is the curry pho, I believe they call it Thai style. It has some heat and some sweet from coconut milk. I add in the jalapenos and basil and enjoy. All their dishes are great so don't be worried about ordering something new.",2
"I enjoyed my time at Chateau Nightclub. I was there the night Nick Cannon celebrated his birthday. The bouncers at the lines were professional as we waited to enter the club. Once inside the club, the coat check was reasonably priced. There were plenty of bars to get drinks, so the lines were not too bad. The DJs played good music inside and out. I will return the next time I am in Las Vegas.",2
"Great hotel with huge rooms and within walking distance to everything uptown has to offer. Everyone we encountered were friendly and accommodating. The rooftop restaurant is expensive, but has a great view and atmosphere. Skip the food and get a couple drinks at the bar. Valet parking is expensive 20 daily , but you can park in the lot right in front of the building for 7 every 12 hours.",2
Be careful with this place.took friends out for dinner and they added on an extra filet mignon meal.yes their most expensive item on their menu! We almost paid it but caught it last minute and when we bring it to the waiters attention he is NOT apologetic AT ALL.just brings the bill back adjusted and doesn't even apologize! Food was good but that experience did not make it worth it.,1
"Amazing delicious! Two lamb shanks combo! Never finished it in a single meal! Very clean! The stuffs are so kind! The guy with a red cap all the time is so shy and funny! nBTW, you can't miss the jalape u00f1o spicy sauce. It is spicy but very delicious! A special smell that can make you feel fresh and comfortable.",2
"In the past I would have given them 4 stars, but now it is only 1. nIt seems there is either new management or ownership. The customer service is not good. Two times in a row, they forgot to make one of my pizzas. The menu has changed and I just don't care for the attitude I get when there. I won't be going back.",1
"Meh. Extremely mediocre food. Fine if you're looking for a pint or two but don't expect anything spectacular to come out of the kitchen my husband and I have tried a few different menu items and have yet to be impressed. It's not BAD, perse, just not memorable. nKudos to the wait staff, they're all super nice and helpful.",1
"Eaten here twice. Very cool atmosphere and decor. Excellent wine. Outstanding food. Attentive staff. Save room for dessert! Our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Sit at the bar so you can see the kitchen staff cook on the grill if you can, its worth the wait. All the flavors were delicious. Savor every bite.",2
"I love the salesperson that helped us mike. But, the company is horrible. I feel like I'm getting the run around. Last Friday they told me the inspector was coming and today we called and they told us someone was coming over to check if the inspector was. Here. Isn't it easier to contact the inspector. I wish I could cancel my contract and go with another company. The follow up is horrible.",1
"Uuugh bathrooms were sticky with piss and it smelled like a petstore. just think. if thats how they keep the part of the resturaunt people DO see, what doe the kitchen look like? food was lackluster service was ok. the maitre d seemed like pissed off to be there. maybe cause she couldn't peep without catching birdflu? i dunno, im not a doctor.",1
" u00c7a faisait longtemps que je n' u00e9tais pas all u00e9 au Cartet pour diner, pourtant c'est u00e0 deux pas du bureau. C'est toujours aussi bon et le service y est aimable et efficace. Je ne me souvenais pas que c' u00e9tait abordable en plus. Ce midi, les p u00e2tes carbonara u00e9taient dignes de l'Italie. Je crois que je vais y retourner plus souvent.",2
"this place is way too expensive. aren't 24 7 casino restaurants supposed to be good values? guess not. went here for breakfast, and had the chicken waffle with scrambled eggs gravy. there was too much gravy. it probably would have been better if i had gotten the gravy on the side. i will say the fried chicken was pretty good. but, i'd explore other options before eating here again.",1
"This is gonna be short and sweet Kazu is absolutely worth all the hype and waiting time! I took a simple shrimp burger , it was very delicious and i'm still thinking about it the next day probably will be for the remaining of the week. Like everyone else said, theres nothing much to say or add JUST GO. Bonus this great food is superrrr affordable Already planning my next trip there. Enough said.",2
My husband and I bought a wonderful set from the Madrid Collection from Paddy O Furniture a few years back. The quality is amazing and we still get compliments on our backyard furniture. We went to this store through a recommendation and now we are recommending it and our friends have had same good experience. Great service and great products!,2
"Came to Rehab during EDC fortunately, Paul Oakenfold was DJing the day we were there so music was decent. But the pool was really, really cold and murky. The crowd was not hot. dare I say, trashy? Yes. Probably the least attractive crowd of all pool parties I've ever been to. Besides that though, it was relatively easy to get a drink at the bar. I'd say stick to Encore or Marquee for day parties.",1
"Absolutely horrible! My husband and I have been going here for years. Tonight, while eating his salad, he bit into a thumbtack . We kept quiet to not cause a scene and discretely told our server. We were with our 2year old daughter He and the owner proceeded to imply that we planted it in there . No "" sorry "" . Nothing. Dirty, filthy restaurant .",1
"The service at this mediocre buffet was sooooo slow. We were done eating our second helping at the buffet before our drinks arrived. The staff in general were unfriendly and not very accommodating, save one server. I would never make the trip out to this buffet since there are so many others in Las Vegas with cheerful helpful staff elsewhere. DON'T BOTHER GOING HERE!",1
"Ordered an item, did not receive any confirmation. When I asked about this they emailed me a copy of my invoice. Waited a week, got nothing. Called and left a message, got an email reply saying my order had been cancelled. You couldn't have told me that yourself? I have to wait a week and ask you where my item is before you tell me I'm not getting it? Absolutely do not order from this company.",1
"We are from the BBQ CAPITAL Kansas City, MO . I will have to say this is the best BBQ we have had in the 6 months I have been here. Shelby was very helpful through out the whole decision making process Joseph even gave us plenty of smoke meat to try. We will definitely be back! I will post pictures next time",2
"Terrible service! We ordered from the hard rock hotel and not only were they an HOUR late, when we called the restaurant they were extremely rude and hung up on us before we could ask anything other than if the pizza was on it's way. We were looking for an affordable alternative for food before hitting the clubs and we were extremely let down. We won't be doing this again.",1
"Probably the best chicken pad thai I've ever had. I love thai food! But this is the first place I've experienced the pad thai spicy.and might I say, it is amazing! The house salad was pretty good for a salad. The mango with sticky rice hit the spot.and fulfilled my dessert craving. If I'm ever in town again, I'm definitely coming back here!",2
"Stopped here twice on a business trip. Great selection of local beer I'm a craft beer enthusiast from NH . I kept getting beer samplers, they were served on a board shaped like Wisconsin. Fried cheese curds were great. Highly recommend the number 30, the egg on a burger sounds weird but is to die for! Friendly waitstaff, beer knowledgeable server.",2
"Claire is a professional on all levels. The wedding photos she did of my daughter's wedding are incredible. She is brilliant, kind and great to work with, and delivered an abundance of amazing pictures to us. I cannot say enough good about her. She also offered the best deal on engagement and wedding package ever. Extremely affordable. She is the best!",2
"SUNDAY FUNDAY! Everything is half off on Sundays. Yes, so this is where you will be finding me when Sunday Night Football is on. They have flavored Saki that my friend has turned me on to. They have great sushi that is served to perfection. And lets not forget the DJ. Love the DJ. Bring your friends, get some Saki, and enjoy the last day of the weekend.",2
"I normally don't review chains, but I was told this was a Pittsburgh staple, so here I am, reviewing a chain. I'm from Jersey. I'm used to real Jersey diners. This diner, in comparison, is kinda the equivalent to Friendly's. If you can't make it to Jersey for your diner needs, at least patronize an independent business instead.",1
"nice lil spot if you come with someone who like to dance to salsa. not my favorite spot in the world . I was not to fond of the way they speak to guest I know they deal with a lot of drunk ass people but you should still have a sense of good character. nTips go to the bar and order yourself , waitresses are rude and take forever to get you served.",1
"Try Ho Fun or Low Mein! They are so good! You can ask them to make your food spicy in level 1 5. Level 1 is perfect, not too spicy but adds up more taste to the food. Chopstix is perfect for dinner or late night if you do not feel like going out or low on budget. At least all the food that I've ordered has been good.",2
"I took my car here to fix my manual clutch, but decided to have someone else fix it after being quoted 1000 less from another shop. The customer service here is HORRIBLE and the people are extremely rude.so rude that I would have paid more to have it fixed somewhere else just to avoid being talked down to.",1
Never again! ! I ordered a steak medium and got a dried out piece of paper! The manager was low key rude at first about it. So on top of waiting forever the food was super bad. They made me another steak that had zero flavor. Must have been marinated in water. They only charged us 10.80 for our whole order in the end. They need a better cook and faster service. I still left a tip.,1
"This is definitely one of the nicest Big Lots I've been to in Vegas so far. its well stocked, organized, has varieties of products and easy to find whatever you're looking for. I come here on occasions just to kill time and I cant help but buy something. Friendly staff and fast check out. Looking forward to more shopping adventures here!",2
"Went to this place for the final time today. The new owner Mark told me I would accept whatever nail tech he assigned to me. Now that is good customer service. The chairs are awful, old equipment and the new owner is not very nice to his staff. My pedicure was uneventful and my toe nails were not cut or shaped. Totally bad experience. What a shame! Tips have to be paid in cash now.",1
"Really, this place still in business with this kind od low service and food. OMG! we were waiting almost 30 minutes to get our food and they even don't care to come to say it will be delay or anything. food taste is horrible and never go back. place is in the getto area and they do business in getto way!",1
"5 Stars? Really people, are you that shallow? I will return to any Fox restaurant any day of the week before I ever step foot at this pretentious spot. At first I couldn't tell if the waiter Pavle was charming then I realized he was a pompous, condescending a hole. The food was ok, not great, not awful. Never again.",1
When I returned to my room at noon the next day the mattress had not been changed. I called the front desk and spoke to another manager. She was apologetic and far more accommodating. The mattress was changed. In fact both mattresses were changed. She waived the resort fee and comped a meal. I appreciate the effort.,1
"I was really hoping to see the guys there, but it must have been a bad time or they were outta town. We saw lots of things there that were purchased on the show, although the prices they put on some of those items on the show were VERY marked up. There was a gun worth 8 10K and it was valued much less on the show.",1
"We wanted a fun cut with some color, and selected three colored tinsel strands. I asked becky at the end where are the color strands she said ""They're in there "" but they weren't. Instead she put a couple colored clips in her hair, which were uncomfortable and had to be removed. The cut itself was very basic just bangs, plus one little braid, for 50.",1
A big no way here. can you give a rating of minus? New to town and yelp Last week met a lady at Capriottis who told me about Groupon. After moving really needed a mani pedi . signed up for Groupon and got a 29 for 65 SPA Mani Pedi . jumped on it! Wished I had read the other reviews of this place first . Left seriously disappointed and will definitely not be back.,1
"I mean.it is what it is. A bar, that's on the North Shore, by the stadium. 'Nough said, right? Ok, maybe not. The food, unremarkable. The drinks, you know.normal offerings. The chick bartenders, dressed to impress.the dudes. I wish there was more to say or better yet, more to do on the North Shore, but it just hasn't happened yet. I'm waiting.I'll be here. You know where to find me!",1
"Hostess was rude. One of them anyway the other was stunning. Atmosphere inviting and relaxing. Wait staff phenomenal. Food was fantastic. Good wine selection. French beers even, if you can trust the French in a brewery. But alas, no Creme Br u00fbl u00e9e. How could a restaurant professing French in title run out of that?",2
"Danelle is truly an eyebrow artist! My brows look fabulous. Not only did she shape my brows like a pro, but she also taught me how to keep them looking great in between visits. I had been using my eyebrow pencil wrong all these years who knew?!? I live out of town, but will definitely make a visit to Danelle a part of my yearly visits.",2
"Absolute greatness! Service friendly Food TRY the faux chicken wings I crave this nKung pao noodles nVegan chilli fries Ambiance A Tip don't order the faux chicken wings Togo. Soggy experience plus they add the carrots, cucumber, celery in the box and close it. Equals the case of raw cooked veggies. Go next door to nami for dessert!",2
"In town following my Dodgers and came across this joint on Yelp. I ordered the pastrami burger with a side of potato salad and a strawberry lemonade to wash it down. Gotta say, they make a pretty mean burger. I'm considering going back before my trip is over. My only beef is, how do you close at 7 on a Friday? Other than that, I really like this place. You need to stop by if you're in town.",2
"Not impressed at all and a little disappointed. The red salsa not spicy or flavorful and the green one was sweet which I was not aware of until I took a huge bite , it took forever to get a waiter and the food not so good I make better tacos at home but, I did like the happy hour price of 2.99 for the margaritas",1
"Atop a hill overlooking Downtown Pittsburgh, this Ice cream shop is exactly what you need when you are looking to get fatter while you to take in the views! I experienced the Cinnamon crumb cake scoop on a sugar cone, it was a very cold day and I wasn't hungry. Talk about a great decision! It was very good and added to the experience! Well done Difore's, well done!",2
"My family and I love this restaurant. I've been many times, for brunch, lunch and dinner and we've always had a very pleasant experience. The food is good, though can be a bit heavy, and the Stetson Salad really is as good as they say it is. They also have a nice drink menu and an extensive wine list. Would recommend, and will be back.",2
Whoa! Pleasant surprise! Service was great and food was so good! I will definitely come back for more when i return to Vegas! This is the kind of place off the strip that you get lucky to find. Food was fresh and delicious! I had the shrimp empanadas as an appetizer the best! The seafood mocajete was boiling and filled with all kinds of yummy seafood!,2
"The waitresses weren't the best looking, if that is what you are looking for I suggest going elsewhere. The service was slow the drinks were watered down and sugary. I was happy with what I ordered however. I ordered the bbq pulled pork sandwich which wasn't bad. On the plus side they have several TVs so it would be a good place to catch a game.",1
"Their claim to fame is their burger, but I have had much better. The patty was thin and overly seasoned. It only comes with cheese and everything you have to ask for extra. I asked for lettuce, but I didn't get it. There were no pickles anywhere. Blasphemy. The fries were kind of thin and skimpy. Much better burgers at the Wisco and Ella's.",1
"I love this library so much. They have a great layout, a perfect location and friendly staff. Their website is extremely helpful. You can search for your books online, request a hold then pick them up in the reserved section under your name. I liked the library so much, I begun volunteering a couple weeks ago. The staff is so nice to the volunteers. I feel very welcome here.",2
Eh. Very greasy. The best part of this whole place is the salsa. Everything else could be better and more fresh somewhere else. I requested a stuffed poblano pepper with rice and beans instead of beans and cheese since I can't digest cheese very well. They said no. I get it but i enjoy when a restaurant tries to accommodate requests.,1
Went to the DG for my sister's bachelorette party and had the best time! The room was beautiful and the staff was amazing! We had the most friendly bell man and valet men! I would definitely recommend this hotel! To get a cab to the strip it was around 20 and Fremont street was so close you could walk! We had the best weekend! Thank you DG!,2
Gross. That pretty much sums it up. I went there once about 4 years ago for lunch and it way pretty good. So I was disappointed when I went last week for dinner before a concert. The food was bland and has an unsanitary feel to the whole experience. I felt like I would have done way better at a regular restaurant for the money.,1
"Heard rave reviews about this place so when in the area with two friends who were familiar, we decided to eat there. ""Meh "" is a good description. Expensive for what you get. Slow. And simply nothing special about the food. They enjoyed their lunches but I think I could have given them peanut butter and jelly on rye and they'd have enjoyed it just as much. There's plenty better out there.",1
Had a yummy toasted Chicken Torta sandwich for lunch today. Staff was super friendly and the owners stopped by my table to chat and make sure everything tasted great. Looks like they have a nice bottled beer and wine selection as well as a small bar with some beers on tap. Definitely check them out!,2
OMG.we took my 12 year old son and 3 friends for his birthday. It was so much fun and I've never seen them all laugh so hard in my life. My husband and I laughed the whole time too. They keep asking when we can go back. I agree and would go back to this family friendly place in a heartbeat. Great fun!,2
"i haven't had this in a long time! i went to aloha kitchen, yes two different locations all in the same day. anyways, i went to aloha kitchen and asked for 3 manapuas. they didn't have any that had been steamed already. so, they steamed 'em up for me right then and there. i was impressed. yes, i waited like 15 20 minutes. But, whatever! they were the absolute freshest that i'd e ver had.",2
"I don't get what why this place has won Best of Phoenix in Phx Magazine. I went to this place for some wings and was not impressed with the run down interior blinds breaking as I was ordering and lack of cleanliness. I would have still looked over that stuff is that food was good, but it was meh. Not worth it, not sure what this place has other than a funny name.",1
"This place was packed! It had a great enery music, but it was hard to dance on the actual dance floor, so I deducted a point. Drinks were expensive, but its Vegas. Stripper poles added a touch of something, the bachelorette I was with used them, which was great! nOh we got in for free too, major bonus!",2
"So, I too am a pizza freak. Grew up in NYC and Florence Italy. I have had pizza all over the world. I'm just not seeing Gramaldi's as having good pizza. First time I was looking foward to it, having had heard so much about it. I was very disapointed. So, I brought some of my family. Again, not impressed and neither were they. As much as I would like. Just can't give it the thumbs up.",1
Drinks are fairly priced service pretty good but the food was tasteless and stale. Have had some fuights here but have recently lost interest. They keep the line moving at a snail's pace and it takes another 20 min just to get a drink at the bar. They have some very aggressive bouncers who i've seen take advantage of kids one too many times,1
Yuck! How do you call yourself a mariscos restaurant and not sell fish? Also they have this picture of a big refreshing margarita and it says .99 happy hour but when you go to order it its as big as a shot glass with ice filled to the rim and it actually costs 2.99! It's the worst Mariscos restaurant I have ever been to! Please don't waste your money!,1
"Ate here randomly with my family, were extremely surprised at the amazing food. Our server was very nice and attentive, she checked on us several times and was very helpful. We ordered the artichoke spinach dip and it was hands down the best we have ever had. I had the quinoa black bean burger and it was phenomenal. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone",2
"Sub par overpriced diner food with incredibly slow service. Our meals came 10 minutes apart, so by the time I started to eat, my wife and son were finished. And the salade ni u00e7oise was disgusting. I ate mine as I was really hungry, but another woman in there sent hers back refusing to pay. The lettuce tasted like it came out the same can as the tuna.",1
"This is our third time to Spotted Donkey and it gets better each time! The Stuffed Peppers are amazing! Possibly the best I've ever had. Not to mention the best Margaritas and Nachos in town! Love the outdoor patio especially the fireplace this time of year. Coming back this week to check out the lunch menu. So glad this restaurant opened in our neighborhood! This is a ""must go "" place.",2
"koi was disgusting. I thought for sure since it was a Japanese restaurant that they would have decent sushi. I am not sure about their other entrees, so I can't speak about that, but the sushi was awful! I ordered the rainbow roll and spit it up, I also ordered the tempura shrimp and it too was not very good I was truly disappointed, do not order sushi! I would try another entree.",1
"It's nice, it's clean, it's about average for an AMerican Mexican resturant. Doesn't strike me as all that authentic but my husband, who leans more towards the AMricanized Mexican food absolutely LOVES the Sonoran Enchilada. He calls it ""Mexican beefy goodness "" and we make special trips from AJ just to get it. Personally, and I can always find something there to eat, think it's just ok.",2
"Wish i could give this place a negative 5. Stopped there because it was late and near WALMART. The condition of the bath room is your best clue as to what to expect of the food. The chicken was grease bomb,no quality what so ever. Had the runs the next day. I've been to Hawaii .and this place it's not it. Will never turn ! On a positive side the ice was frozen water.",1
"You go in and it looks great. The pastries look like real french pastries. The food is well arranged. The menu is compelling. Give the the spicy sausage sandwich with roasted peppers I ask. Whoops tasted like a cheap hot dog not spicy at all with some canned peppers. Not good. Coffee was great, though.",1
"I usually try not to judge a restaurant from only a single time ordering, but I have to say. the previous reviews were right, this place has got to be worst Chinese I've ever ordered. Terrible Terrible Terrible. Some of the food tasted like it was frozen, most of it was inedible. After this meal, I will not be giving this restaurant a second chance.",1
"If I could give a lower rating I would. I was there for the HCG 4 week weight loss program that I saw advertised in a flyer. The program, I learned on the final day, was actually only three weeks. I had done the HCG program at a different place a few years ago and it was much more extensive and much less expensive.",1
"I've used Capitol City Auto several times over the last year for repairs on my 1970 Pontiac GTO. They did an excellent job and kept me updated on their progress. They also work on modern day cars too most of their business is just this . Very fair prices, and I plan to bring them more of my business in the future.",2
Even though no one else likes this place. I'm a big fan! Can we say cheap but super yummy mojitos? And a nice ambiance for a Saturday night! I can actually hear people talk without having to sit two cms away from them or having to shout. How awesome is that? this is the chill bar that I've been looking for. Who wants to deal with the pretentious crowd across the street at Boltinis anyway?,2
"Sad to say.I'm a regular here! After living here for a while, you become desperate for a local scene to sit back and enjoy the games.thank god I found this place! Its the perfect place to enjoy the game while sitting by the fireplace on the outside patio w a more than courteous wait staff. It can be pricey at times pending your food choice, but its def a local favorite for me.",2
"Really, really wanted to like this place. But alas, food just ok. For the , totally not worth it. Doughnuts sucked don't waste your 7 for 3 tiny, dry things. Latte up charged 1 for vanilla syrup. Seriously?! Located attached to parking garage for which, wait for it, they don't validate. And there was piece of plastic wrap in our skillet. Service not great, but that may vary with your server.",1
"Great local pub if you live in or near Mountain's Edge. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They have a traditional bar for adult nights out and a separate dining room if you're feeding the kiddies. Reasonable prices and good food, you can count on Rounders for good times, people and eats.",2
"We had great hopes for this place when it opened. Take out was good, fast and cheap, eat in was slow, rude and felt as If we were intruding. Over the past few months the food quality has slipped to a new low, but luckily for us the last three times we tried to order take out they put us on hold till we nearly starved to death and ate leftovers.",1
Overall good park. Its pretty big in the big dog area. And too small in the small dog area. I have a mix retriver 4 months old that love to play with the big boys so no problem here . nI also like the obsticals for the dogs. nThe dogs water fountain was dirty. Thats a problem. And also there is no signing to direct you to the park. But. We had a good time ,2
"Always have a great experience here. The food is amazing and everyone is very courteous. I love that this is an office away from the office, as well. Free wi fi though it seems to get slow when it gets crowded and fast service. A little pricey when you have to do everything yourself, but I like that they have several healthy options. The not so healthy options are awesome, too!",2
"Perfect burgers. Good and fast service too! I would give 5 stars, but the restaurant opened today at 11 00, New Year's Day. We waited until 11 15 before the doors opened. Other than that, the onion rings were great, the vanilla milkshake was INCREDIBLE. We also had the brunch burger and LA burger. Both delicious!",2
"So this place is pretty new, like still figuring their stuff out it seems. Food was pretty dang good. The Carne Asada was very good, the chicken was big chunks so I'd suggest the beef instead. Everything else was typical mexican style food and flavor. All made fresh though so they've got that going for them. Prices were great btw! We'll be back for sure",2
"This is our first stay at the Cosmopolitan and we love it. The staff is terrific and they provide service that comes across as very personal. The view from our room overlooking the Bellagio fountain and the strip is fabulous and we love the balcony. This is just our second day, but so far we are definitely planning future stays here.",2
"I am always impressed by the food at this restaurant. This is a step above the typical Mexican place. Mexicasa also has great drink specials! My only complaint is that the food can sometimes take a long time to come out, and on three separate occasions I've ordered carnitas and the tortillas took an additional 10 minutes to come to my table after the food arrived.",2
"Innovative. Great decor, great atmosphere, great performers, high production values all around. Near ideal if you're sick of giant clubs, crazy lines, don't mind a kinky esque vibe. Not sure it'll survive in Vegas, but I'm glad it's there. If you enjoyed Sleep No More http www.yelp.com biz sleep no more new york , then you definitely need to visit this place if you're in Vegas.",2
"Some people hate chain restaurants, but so far I haven t had any issues with this Ra or the one at Kierlands. Sushi was fresh, flavorful and just right. Take advantage of their happy hour , good specials! nI m a sashimi fan so had the salmon and halibut. Very good. And so was the ultimate shrimp tempura roll. Lively atmosphere and another people watch place!",2
"Saw them on Food Networks Diners, Drive ins Dives. There was a bit of a wait which can be considered a good sign. The food did not disappoint! Very good flavor on everything we ordered. Will come back when I return to Vegas. n I would have rated 5 Stars if the hostess was friendly. She didnt smile at all and didnt offer a menu to look at while we waited for our table.",2
"Everything on the menu was fantastic! Came here for dinner late night with a group of 8. They have fun music bumpin' and a great menu of small plates and specialty drinks. Not terribly expensive, its Vegas so you should expect to drop a little coin and this place was totally worth it. We ordered 1 of almost everything and two of the veggie lasagna. Loved it all!",2
"Can I say it's about time a gas station opened up between Costco and Ann road?! A large, cheap convenience store with cheap gas that you don't need a Costco membership for? I mean, what else could you ask for! It's probably the nearest gas statioear my neighborhood that actually has a pretty big convenience store Need to start a road trip with 100s of gas station snacks? AMPM is the place for you ",2
I love coming to Cornish Pasty! I usually sit at the bar because I love how they have old doors as the table. Super unique. I always get the chicken pot pie pasty which is so filling I usually take the 2nd half home and heat it up for lunch. It is definitely a great spot for a date night or a larger group dinner.,2
"I love their clean upscale decor, really different from your average Chinese restaurant. The food is very good and authentic I am Chinese, so I know my Chinese food , and the staff were all very friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant for those who want authentic Chinese food with a great ambiance.",2
"I love the selection of Dark beers on draft.the food? Have yet to have something that doesn't leave me coming back for more and I have had just about every item on the menu! The service is friendly and great, love going as a family, with friends or karaoke nights are fun too! Now with their expansion, it just makes it that much better! Great neighborhood bar to hang out at!",2
"I have eaten here for years and have never had a bad meal. In my opinion, they have the best red and green sauce around. I usually stick with the tacos, nana's favorite, the chili, and the beef and cheese burrito. yes, it is basic sonoran fare but it is better than most mexican joints i have been to in the valley.",2
"I am addicted to their shredded beef tacos! Their machaca beef melts in your mouth, everything I've eaten here is delicious. They are one of the very few restaurants in the area that consistently get perfect scores from the health board. Check it out on maricopa.gov, it's made me think twice about eating out, but I know Caramba's is safe.",2
"Stop number three along the mono rail path. Early morning, no one is up yet and it's fun to walk around the property and explore what's here. We are able to check out the restaurants and their menus, and what shows are available. The casino floor is big, spread out, clean and that annoying smoke is limited.",2
"Upon our arrival we were greeted by the smiling Maria and since my two guests had never been here, she had took time to explain how everything works. I loved how they give you an extra small bowl to apply your sauces I fill it with two parts yc's own, one part spicy Hunan, one part garlic, and don't forget the spicy oil! Great experience was had and now my guests look forward to coming back.",2
"FLIES EVERYWHERE! Ick. I don't like having to fight with the flies for the first bite of my food. Not to mention the pizza makes me sick every time I go. If the flies in the dining room are any indication of the conditions of the kitchen, I think I'm better off eating elsewhere. The one star is because they have awesome happy hour beer prices and a huge selection of beers on tap.",1
"Awesome shop! Clean open layout by style. Neat section of North Carolina brewed beers in the middle. Chris is great, very helpful. I picked a few things we can't get in Georgia. I will absolutely go back next time I am in town. I believe he had 12 on tap to sell by the glass or growler. Today was stout day on the taps so it was right up my alley.",2
If you are looking for good customer service this is not the place. It starts at the front door by the sour expression on the hostess face and spreads through the restaurant to the servers. I watched one waitress deliver food to three tables snd not say a word to her customers. Tory was our server and she was great.,1
"No memberships, no contracts? ONLY 15 a month. That's their advertisement. I tried it for a week, and it is an average Gym, and since I'll stay close for 1 month I thought I could join. More so if you don't have a membership fee or similar. Turns out that for just a month you end up paying more than 45, oh because there IS A ""membership "" FEE of 30 something. SCAM!",1
Definitely going back. Want to try it for dinner with cocktails . Took my Indian friend there and was a little worried. He likes food spicy. But he loved it! Ate my hummus too. The food was very flavorful and the portions were generous. nI had the Souvlaki and my friend had the Beef Lamb Gyro. Prices were good. I do want to go back and try the Moussaka and Baklava.,2
"Wait, what did you say? You can custom make your own pasta dish? I'm in. Za's delicious italian selections have definitely made a name for themselves. Everyone love's Za's. It's inexpensive and it's good. The meals are made in a speedy process, so don't worry if it's crowded, it usually moves along just fine.",2
"we had the back door pizza for a village and in a word.yuck. i think the spinach was frozen and not fresh, the prosciutto had an unusual bitterness or was it the sauce? we also paid 8 bucks for two tins of lettuce with either bland dressing on one or little to no dressing on the other and maybe a few shavings of cheese. soooo not worth the money.",1
"I took my dog here for a TPLO surgery. U of I Vet Hospital botched the surgery by using too large of a blade and cutting too close to the bone! My dog had to suffer for 8 months and required a secondary corrective surgery which I went to a different vet for, one who actually knew what they were doing . I highly recommend NOT taking your pet here!",1
"My family had a decent dinner I had a bug in mine. The waitress was less than sympathetic when I mentioned the extra protein in my food. I finally told her forget it, so they kindly credited back my portion of the meal and I left hungry. I gave it two stars because apparently my husband and son's dinner was edible I wouldn't know as I left hungry.",1
"I went to Von's only to get a gallon of milk. I detest this store. Oh, it's clean and the employees are friendly. But they have nothing and the produce is awful and expensive. No supermarket here is as good as the worst ones back east, but Von's is my least favorite. It's the closest to my house, though, so I'm usually passing by when I need milk or tuna salad. Even the parking lot sucks!",1
"The 1000 positive reviews have probably already covered everything I could ever say about this place. For a more relaxed atmosphere, visit its lounge counterpart, Surrender, which is located right across the way. Best effing nightclub I've ever experienced. The Messiah of nightlife! How am I ever going to appreciate Arizona clubs ever again? Thanks a lot, XS.",2
"Great food and service, will definitely try the 1 2 price martinis with the girls from work! This was my first time here and I was very impressed with the food. Have had catered Nolen before amazing , they are capable of knocking your socks off! nThis is fantastic for a date you can sit outside on their new patio that has heaters as well as fireplaces , or inside at a table or at the bar.",2
"Best waffles ever! I love the crunchy bits of caramelized sugar complimented by the soft, warm texture of the waffle itself. And you can make the craziest combination from the plethora of toppings available or keep it as deliciously simple as Nutella, whipped cream, and bananas. Between frozen yogurt or waffles or both, everyone is sure to leave stuffed and happy!",2
"I've eaten at Hubbard Ave Diner many times. Great pie, good service, average food, really inconsistent execution by the kitchen. If they aren't busy, you've got a good chance to have your order arrive correct as in get what you ordered as you ordered it and hot. If they are busy, forget it. They really need to have an expediter in the kitchen.",1
"I got a pizza from here and it was downright awful. It was very dry and there was little to no sauce. The cheese almost tasted old as well. It might have been because it was on Saint Patty's Day, however the store did not look busy and I came to pick it up. I certainly would not consider this pizza place as there are many, many better options.",1
"I go here all the way from California. the sweet and spicy chicken is out of this world. we go on Sunday's after church and there is maybe a couple tables that are occupied. So the service is great! and the prices are so right on, I brought my granddaughter here and they where so nice to her, sometimes food place can snub children. this is the place to go if you are ever in Henederson look it up.",2
".Walmarts without a grocery store still exist? Who knew. Overall one of the most dingy stores in the valley and absolutely crawling with the sort of people featured on peopleofwalmart.com I can definitively say that if this is a ""neighborhood Walmart "" then I have no reason to be in or around that ""neighborhood "" again.",1
"While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door. We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties. Since we were still unable to get her attention, we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street.",1
"I went to Legume for the first time a few weeks ago. The atmosphere, service, and food were excellent. We made a reservation for a Friday night. The food is very fresh, local, and best of all, delicious. When eating the first bites of my food, I paused to enjoy all of the flavors. Also, bring a bottle of your favorite wine.",2
Food is always good at any Filiberto's.but service usually sucks. I stood at the counter staring at a worker speaking Spanish on the phone. She didn't acknowledge me and stayed on the phone. A worker from the back had to come up and help me. The worker working the drive thru couldn't help me because she was busy with drive thru.,1
"Honestly, the business center is pretty minimal and low tech for a location that hosts a lot of conferences. I spent 45 making a color print which I had to hand edit , then making 50 color copies. There were only 2 people working the office, and the programs available on the business center computers were VERY limited. The staff was friendly, but the technology was slow and could have been better.",1
"DO NOT DRIVE AWAY WITHOUT CHECKING YOUR ORDER! And the reason why I'm yelling is so you don't miss this lol. This place is terrible. Horrible management staff is very inexperienced food is 3 out of 10 ""pull up and we will bring you the food "" 20 minutes later. Get the drift ?!?This place is no good.",1
"LOVE everything about this place! The food is prepared perfectly and the service is outstanding thank you for doing such a great job on Sunday David ! I've read reviews that the restaurant is overpriced, but I disagree. The quality and freshness of the food is worth every penny! I look forward to going back often especially since the menu is seasonal.",2
"Picked some up last night. The customer service was amazing. If I was hiring a customer service rep I would hire Tanise. She tried to offer me everything I sure they were promoting without being annoying. The food was yummy as always. This is my go to food when I really don't feel like cooking. Thanks Tanise. Panda, you should promote her!",2
"I would definitely go back to Sugar Ice next time I'm at the Wynn. We had two different smoothies mine was the berry lemonade and it was very good. My husband said his was a tad too sweet, but he finished it all, so. Yes, it's pricey and the ladies behind the counter weren't very friendly at all, but it's a cute place with an awesome view. I'd go again.",2
"Our experience is far from over, but I must balance out these negative reviews. We are three days into our newborn son's stay post an emergency airlift after delivery and we have had a stellar experience. The team in the NICU are not only incredibly kind and compassionate, but they are the best in class providers. We will forever be indebted to them.",2
"What can you say about simple, basic, fresh and really tasty burger joint that hasn't been said before? Honestly I love how simple and tasty it really is. Reminds me of Dick's back in Seattle but their fries are even better! but I love the toasted bun of the burger as well! While I don't use the ""secret menu "" it's there and many go Animal style!",2
"Took over an hour and 15 minutes to get my pizza delivered, and it came out of the oven over an hour minutes earlier I called the store to check on my order . The pizza itself was not good probably because it had sat out of the oven for over an hour , and the breadsticks were also very poor soggy, just kinda gross .",1
This will be my last visit here. It has gone downhill as they have upped their prices and decreased the quality of service. My last visit was rife with constant attempts to upsell and tip hustling in broken English and with a smart phone translation app throughout the massage. With all the massage reflexology joints littering this part of town there are better options to seek out.,1
"The quality isn't great, but if you want Mexican and don't have much time, it is better than Taco Bell etc. There seems to be a consistency problem. f you order the same thing meal several times, the meal will be a little different each time. Needs better quality control when it comes to the ingredients being used. Store and furniture are kind of dumpy.",1
"Grouchy John's hits all the marks a quality, independent coffee shop should friendly, inviting atmosphere, consistently good coffee and a sense of community. I enjoy going to Grouchy's as it feels like I'm feeding into the positivity their shop and truck exudes. Great coffee. Try the salted OG with soy, iced!",2
"I loved it! but maybe it was because the salsa bar was such a huge hit with me. Though, when I did ask a question about a specific salsa, the waitress couldnt help me answer.confusion language barrier, whichever. I went in Dec. 2011. Service was okay.food I have no complaints. Id definitely go again.",2
"Brunch brunch I love brunch. Brunch at MIA yeah yeah yeah was so good yum yum. So let me tell you something, the brunch is NOT Indonesia. I know, right? So just lower that expectation. But keep it high cause its still pretty delightful. Menu features a bevy of omelettes, crepes and two types of eggs Benny. I'll be back to brunch again, 100 and definitely to try the dinner menu. See ya soooooon.",2
"Large portions size, has no flavor. i saw a busser wiped down a table and left a booths seat dirty. Next customer arrived slides down sat on top of it. Servers's aprons mostly are dirty. Bathroom are disgusted. If you like a meal filled with potatoes and little taste. I would recommended here. Not happy and never wanted to come back.",1
"Josh I believe you, but from the menu on line they're charging NYC prices .80 per wing WOW just to name one in the desert which is stupid with so many other places around Tailgaters Grill will have to work real hard for me and my crew to come in their location. Please take a look at their menu it's a little pricey",1
"This place is GREAT ! nMy partner and I have been coming here for a couple it years and each time we have had nothing but exceptional service. It is ALWAYS a great experience, staff is ALWAYS friendly, have never been steered wrong with them. A great experience in all. We WILL definitely continue to bring our cars here without hesitation. Awesome job to all !",2
"We found this as we wandered down the Royal Mile. We were tired of trekking and ieed of lunch. This turned out to be a fortuitous place nice atmosphere, great host loved his dog! and good food. Prices were more than reasonable and the portions were sufficiently large that we had more than enough food.",2
"Bisonte is by far my favorite place for pizza. The pizza tastes great every time and the staff is wonderful. We tried the calzones this Friday and have to say was not impressed. Too much of the crust was used to close the calzone and too little filling. The filling chicken, mushroom, onion while barely there was quiet flavorful. Think we will stick to the pizza with specialty crust.",2
"It started when I tried to drive on the lot only to have 2 men jump in front of my truck asking if I needed help. Then to a service rep that definitely had no clue about customer service and to top it off, just because I am a woman don't treat me like an idiot. Definitely won't be using this location again",1
Came in for a date night with my bride and really enjoyed the whole experience. The beer menu is simply stunning and the food was really good. This place is consistently busy for a reason. I would say that everyone could find something to like from the vast food menu they offer. I look forward to returning to this place.,2
"The blackened swordfish of the day was cooked perfectly but the chef drowned it in pepper, which was unfortunate because otherwise this fish would have been delicious. The squash soup also a special of the day tasted like it came from a can. The service here is very good but the food just doesn't add up.",1
"Well I'm not vegetarian, as can be noted by my patented American Gut. With that said, order a hot dog they are hard to screw up. This place is way overpriced for the crud they serve up. You might find a bunch of soccer moms taking their loud kids there. I hate kids. so. maybe this has jaded my review. Que Sera",1
"You caever go wrong with Denny's. Food is always up to par, service is quick and with a smile, and deals they have are hard to beat. Love the fact that they're usually open 24 hours, so if you happen to be out late, you can enjoy a meal there. By checking in on yelp I also received 15 off my ticket.",2
I had breakfast at the bar here one beautiful Sunday morning. I had the pancakes with bacon. I didn't realize how large the pancakes were going to be. It was so good that I didn't wan to stop eating them. The bacon was cooked to perfection. It's a nice little place and awesome for people watching which I love to do. I will be returning. This may just become my favorite breakfast spot.,2
"Came here on a HOT evening July 4th weekend! Pros n Really awesome decor, the back opens up so you can walk through to the outside n Very open, even though it was hot the pool cooled down the outside. n Strong Drinks! n Cool cabana areas to hang out in! Cons n It was HOT, not Spanish Fly's fault though n You can't go in the pool n You may fall into the pool",2
"A little more expensive than your usual gun range, but there's no line and a little more upscale than other locations. The instructor spends one on one time with each customer, with each gun. You get to choose from a variety of packages with a variety of gun selections. It's a fun activity to check out, especially if you're from a state like California where fully automatic guns are illegal.",2
"I've always been a fan of Michael Mina's restaurants. I was very disappointed with American Fish. Course after course, I was looking for the next one to be ""the one "" that redeemed the last. A big miss all around. Really, not one course was anything above average for me. The wine pairing was excellent, though.",1
"I've been to Diamond Nails about half a dozen times and have had great experiences. Still, like at most nail salons, they sometimes don't do a good job letting the polish dry between coats which means it smudges easily. I like that they have a menu for pedicures and aren't super pushy trying to push additional services.",2
"The views and the live music combined was really pure heaven. nTook off a star because of a strange sale on martinis that leads to folks getting over served. The waitress brought two drinks instead of the one we ordered .4 total. She said the second drink was free.but no sharing? n.?. If you miss this place while in Vegas, it would be a shame, it's great.",2
"not really a fan of this place. located in the very corner, you probably wouldn't notice they were there. i was hungry so loaded the grill with everything. it was taking too long to cook so i turned up the heat and you probably know what happened next. smoke out. they also didn't want to change or clean my grill so anything else i ate tasted burnt. there wasn't a big selection.",1
"If you like over cooked dried up brisket, this is your place. Is not for me. The smoked meatloaf was very salty and tasteless. The chicken salad was all dark meat which answers the question of where the rest of the bird goes when preparing the chicken plate toted as all white meat. Even cooper's town has better BBQ. Skip this place, there's better places. Service was good though. Thanks Britney",1
"The food here is bland and the quality is shoddy. For 20 something I expected much better. We came here for lunch, and I tried some of the Italian food and Asian food. The food was bland, it tasted like poorly microwaved food. Sure there is a lot of variety, however, to my taste buds everything tasted bland and salty especially the soups . Bottom Line Skip this buffet and go somewhere else.",1
"Visiting from Toronto, I was really impressed! The amount of tickets to be won was incredible. We usually got 200 tickets per play on average. Compared to Playdium here, that's awesome considering I'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. The food is great, the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food.",2
"I'd heard a ton about this spot and after going, it was very disappointing. The set up is a bit awkward since the dance floor in located ""downstairs "". While the crowd was alright and the drinks were okay, the music was absolutely awful.maybe I went on the wrong night Saturday ? The main draw for me to go out to a club is to listen to great music and this place did not have it.I will not go back.",1
"Professional stylists that do a great job! Have been going here for about 2 3 yrs. I am picky about hair stylists and don't like to take chances with the outcome of hair color. I have tried Denise, Debbie, Mara Donna. They are all good. Denise is too busy lately but there are others that are equally good.",2
"Love this place especially after a workout or when I am driving around trying to find something quick for dinner. Everything I get is healthy, fresh, and delicious! My favorite is the 10 veggie salad, my husband loves the California wrap and my daughter's fav is the turkey panini, best smoothies anywhere and I love the amount of juices available.",2
Great food and really good prices! Staff is good most the time and has always got the order right. 3 words Ava Pollo Fundido. If you like a Jalepeno kick and chicken chimichangas then that's your dish. Carne Asada Quesadilla is the bomb and they give you guac and sour cream FREE here! Nice little joint and nice to support local places.,2
"I had the ""Carson Palmer "" green chili buro it was awesome. The meat was tender and could've eaten with out teeth, flavor was robust and cheesy, yummy! The service was super friendly and loved the music that was playing. It was like they hacked my I pod. The only reason for 4 stars is the place could use some updating otherwise it would've been 5.",2
There really any good cuts of beef and the selection is limited. The piece of Chicken I had is really not too fresh in my opinion. The veggies are old and not fresh. If u do decide to give this place a try make sure you ask for discount in front of the restaurant or talk to your hotel concierge. They may be able to combine your meal with a show for less. Desert is not included!,1
Today we stopped in for a few drinks after being here last week and being surprised at how great the happy hour is at this location. If you sit at the bar and get Cynthia count yourself lucky! Great service. Drinks are priced right and the food comes out quickly. Ive seen the bad reviews but I just dont get that. 2 times in 2 weeks and I am a happy camper at this hapoy hour.,2
I dont understand why the check out ladies have to be so mean. I mean I like to use coupons and have to use them if I go to Vons since they are so expensive. I had a couple of coupons and you would have thought I was holding up the store. I thought they were going to come in and arrest me for backing up the line. I well I guess I will stay out of vons,1
Called to make an appointment last week and Rick returned call promptly. Scheduled cleaning for today and he did a GREAT JOB! Carpet LOOKS and SMELLS better than it did before. Very happy found him on YELP! The guy is a one man team and works very hard and was on his way to another job. Will most def promote Carpet Monkeys to friends. Thank you Rick!,2
Onion rings were really good! Drinks weren't prepared the best I had to send it back. Service was great! Clean bar. Several menu items. However do not attend their events! I went for fight night and they advertised free it was 10 they packed the place out where there was standing room only and a fight broke out in the bar!,1
What is going on here?!?! nThe last few times I have gone into Lee Lee they don't have what I want. They never have clams anymore and they didn't have the shrimp I wanted or the live Dungeness crabs. Every time I come in here I always have to go to Mekong to get what I really want. So from now on I'm just going straight to Mekong. nGet it together Lee Lee!,1
"I LOVE this place! It's a great addition to Surprise! Their breakfast is wonderful, I was stuffed, it was reasonably priced. Came back a week later for dinner, same. Everyone loved their food. It's decorated so cute they have a live feed of New York which is actually memorizing to watch. Visit this place! Don't let such a wonderful establishment die out in Surprise!",2
"Nothing special, it is Kmart after all. Deals are hard to come by, but you have to just look a little bit longer. It is true that the employees really don't seem to care that they are at work. I can relate, I did my time in retail. Although I left it when my time was due. Good for the area if you don't want to run to a nearby shopping area.",1
Had the coconut shrimp as an app. Was very delicious. Would definitely order that again. Wife and I each had the lamb shank and it was very tender and juicy. nMeal came with fried cabbage and soup to start. Both yummy but i especially liked the fried cabbage as I've never had it before. nIt was a small restaurant so service was good. Didn't make us wait long in between courses.,2
I love coming here when I am in town. I think the sandwiches are delisous and fairly inexpensive. The bread is crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside. After all it is a bakery. nI am now hooked on the honeydew boba. So fun to drink. Once the boba settles and gets cold it is hard to pull them up in the straw but thats whats fun.,2
"My husband and I went for a late lunch and tried the chicken kabob wrap. We were not impressed. It really did not have a lot of flavor. It was really very wet and drippy. I needed at least 6 napkins, which thankfully are on the table. Maybe we ordered the wrong item. But, how can a place mess up a wrap? The place didn't seem very clean. The table was sticky.",1
"If had the chance to stay in your car or Hard Rock Hotel stay in your car. Wifi didn't work, safe didn't work, front disk and nManager extremely unprofessional. When I called to complain she was trying to make a believe that with removing resort fee everything will be Better. I won't be back to this establishment ever again. Not even for free.",1
Cheap shutters. Owner talked me into the slider shutters. He said they would block out most of sun.not even close. Very flimsy plastic coverings. Installer was very professional and quick. Screws are sticking out at all angles and it will be a mess to replace. I have been putting it off but need to clean up the mess.,1
"Hands down, this is some of the best tasting Mexican food in Phoenix. The staff is very friendly, recognizes just about all of their regulars and make you feel like family while at their restaurant. At times, the wait can be a little lengthy but it's worth the time and it allows you to enjoy more of their delicious salsa and chips. I recommend the chile relleno or red chile tamale.",2
"Good but VERY greasy a medium rare 1 2 lb burger drips a shot glass worth of grease. Good quality meat but cooked on a flat griddle cooking surface not on a open grill, the meat just stews in it's own boiling fat. That may be ok for McD's where every burger is cooked to death and then beyond but that doesn't work for me.",1
"Walked in with a group of friends who refused to venture to the neighborhood of the half decent Korean restaurants. I finally persuaded them to at least check out the menu and pricing before we got seated. ""SIDE DISHES ban chan AND RICE ARE AVAILABLE AT AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE "" I've never walked out of a place so fast. The nerve.",1
"I had the fish fry last sat November 21, 2014 and got food poisoning. I was there at 830 pm and felt sick about 15 mins after leaving. Throwing up fish, living by the toilet and not getting paid for 2 days work is what i suffered. I was sick for 3 days and needless to say I will never eat there again!",1
"Everyone was beyond wasted and very ignorant. I can't count how many times I almost got knocked down by some nA hole! People were making out to the extreme where it was just discusting! It was hard to get to the bar to order a drink because nobody was kind enough to make space. Yah, I definitely would not go back! I was embarrassed that I brought my friends there!",1
"Had not been here for a while! decided to give it another try. What a waste of time! Gone way, way down hill. The only thing french about this place is its location in the Paris Hotel. The food was tasteless and lacked authenticity. About the only thing worthwhile was the crepe station. Save your money. Eat elsewhere, better, for a lot less.",1
Normally this place is great but tonight I decided to take my friend to have drinks. We were the only patrons at the bar and we were only able to get one drink while watching both bartenders gossip and check their text messages. It is really sad when bad service kills an otherwise great place. Eat here but don't go near the bar area.,1
"Had my first black tie the Night of Gold Ball benefiting John C. Lincoln Health Foundation event at the new Sheraton downtown. They did a great job. The space is fantastic, the food was above average for mass production and the service was excellent. I would recommend this venue to other charitable organizations.",2
"Good location, always busy, decent parking, and food is 100 time better than the Hooters that is literally across the street. The food is always good. Warning to the pregnant ladies Some of the wing sauces that may not bother you before you were pregnant, will set off the morning sickness just by smell alone. Use caution!",2
"I usually hate cupcakes from the little cupcake stores. I WANT to like them because I think the idea is so fun and cute . I LOVED the cupcakes here. they are moist and good and the flavor selection caot be beat. I would never buy my cute cupcakes from anywhere else. i really think these are by far the best! In fact, I will be there tomorrow picking up a dozen yummy",2
"Wow, since my last post, I've replaced that dishwasher and I'm on my 2nd one. This one's a lemon too! I went in the other day to replace this one. They gave me an upgrade and I had to add an add'l 75 but I'm upgraded and waiting for the new one to come in. Third time's a charm? We'll wait and see. Thanks Lowe's.so far, you've been amazing.",2
"E2 is excellent. It is by far my favorite place on Bryant street. I always end up getting the risotto of the day. I have yet to be disappointed. It is always tasty and perfectly prepared. The portion is also perfect. If I'm super hungry, I make sure to get a salad. As a warning, The place is very small and cramped. I don't mind, but some guests with me have had issues with the lack of space.",2
"Last Thursday I met my girlfriend here for a drink and a late lunch. We were having such a good time we ended up staying there for SIX HOURS! It was the people working there that made it fun. You can tell they like being there. We sat with Lee, the owner, for a while at the bar. He really knows what he is doing here. I guess that is why I keep going back. nandy gervase",2
"Such a badass sandwich shop! Nowhere else I've seen like Cheba Hut. Their sandwiches are on point.service is always friendly and fast, and the whole ""theme "" they've got going on is definitely comforting for any state of mind. I'm just hoping one day their herb bread actually has.well.I think you know where I'm going with that! Orange Widow is the best. Get it!",2
"So yeah visited a buddy in Scottsdale and stopped into Shotgun Betty's for a few suds, great atmosphere I almost felt like it was a movie setting, drink specials and reasonable beverage prices! It is a tad bit gimmicky but the music kicks ass and the staff is very friendly and ridiculously hot! We had a good time and will stop iext time I'm in town for sure.",2
"Yay! A place that offers happy hour on Saturdays until 8 00! You can't beat 5 glasses of great wine at this tiny place. We stopped in for a drink on our way to dinner, and ended up staying a couple of hours. If you dislike crowds, this is not the place for you, as it was packed the entire time we were there. The secret it out!",2
"Firstly, let me say this restaurant came highly recommended. However, both the food and service disappointed. If you enjoy flavorless steaks that taste like olive oil and fat, then this is the place for you. The food is mediocre and the service was subpar. At 144 for just a steak, you expect a phenomenal steak. Save yourself 120 and go to Outback Steakhouse.",1
"The dim sum is very good at C Fu. It's always crowed over weekend. The only think I always told people about this restaurant is that their food is too salty. It tastes very good, but you will have to keep drinking water or tea to digest the salt. They have the test chicken feet in town. Don't tell me you don't like it until you give it a try. ",2
Got a Groupon so decided to try Mind Over Batter. Have had Caketini often as it is at the mall and I think Mind Over Batter is the winner. Loved the Lemon Raspberry. Shop was cute and service was fast and freindly. I get the cupcake is the new hot item in desserts right now.but without a groupon I would not pay full price.,2
"Very pricey dinner menu, but I couldn't get a simple salad with a vinegarette dressing. Drinks are over priced without any flair. The carne plate, supposed to be their signature dish had much room for improvement. I had high expectations for my first time at this place, but was definitely disappointed!",1
"Everyone talks about the baguettes and paninis at Sandwich Express, but when I was a regular visitor about a year ago it was the portion size and quality of their plated dishes that impressed me. Homemade carbonara for only a few pounds was a favourite. Hopefully they are still serving these dishes, if they are then I mightily recommend them as a budget spot on Leith Walk!",2
"two Hippies Dropped Out of College and Opened Up a Pizzaria? Maybe they should have stayed in school. Underpriced and tasteless. Just want I DON'T want, a bargain on tasteless pizza. Half of these pizzas are just stupid. A pizza with russian dressing? Really? Let's see if this flies. I say Yikes. STAY AWAY.",1
"This is a gem of a farm to table restaurant. The menu changes at least in part because of what local producers are bringing in. Really inventive cooking. It has been in its new location only a couple of weeks, and the restaurant is working hard to make things smooth. It's quieter than the prior location no more pretty tin ceiling . 2 valet parking across the street.",2
AWESOME! Burgers are fantastic and sushi is great. Try blackend ahi tuna nachos and ask for crab Rangoon dip. Stellar service no Reuben on menu but mom really wanted one so they created it. Download their very clever app and you can get on the wait list before you arrive. Our new favorite place for lunch and dinner.,2
I've gone twice and have had a great experience on both occasions. The servers have been very knowledgeable and friendly. This is a perfect date night restaurant. I've had the shrimp linguine on both occasions and just love it. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a place where you can get a little more dressed up than usual and enjoy a lovely evening of food and wine.,2
"I agree with reviews below, service is lightning fast! We got the lunch special I ordered veggie lo mein, it wasn't bad. I guess I'm more f a t his food kinda girl, flavors were pretty good, but my skirt isn't blowing. If you've come for free Wi Fi, u had better be charged up with a full battery because the one available outlet is dead. Not bad fo 6.",1
"Ok I've been here a couple times. If you're looking for the ugly shoes that didn't sell in the regular ALDO store back in 2010, then here's your second chance at buying them now! They are ALL here. The ugly pointy light brown loafer, the gladiator sandal, that other sandal that had that horrible loop around your big toe, all of them are here at 75 off a price that was obviously way overblown.",1
They have a poor advertising promoting steak and crab legs 12.99. Be prepared to fight for it though. Ate at the Las Vegas Blvd and Warm Springs location but no employee has ever heard of it OR managers they say it's only for participating. I said its false advertising and it was honored. Sadly worst crab legs we ever had. DRY DRY DRY. Eat there all the time! Very disappointed.,1
"Terrific food and cheerful service. ALL the food is well done. The sauces are good and if I could one thing, I would out the sauces in bottles and the bottles on the table. It's a pain to bother the server for another little serving of the great Midwood sauce and the equally fine Hamanero sauce. This is real food, folks. You can taste the smoke.",2
This is the best buffet that is part of the total rewards group. There is so much food to choose from and the quality and taste is pretty good for cooking mass quantities. The major issue with the buffet is the amount of time it takes to get to the buffet they need to work on opening more cashiers and look an a better efficient service.,2
"Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P burgh in fact, usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. Every dish I've had has been excellent some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi, tuna tartare, arugala salad, bread pudding, and pretty much every soup. The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. The menu is so inventive!",2
"Went here over the weekend. Heard great things about it from some locals. We did the Karaoke bar. My girls Nicole and Kelly sang some amazing songs. The DJ Travis was fantastic. If you love to sing which I don't sing but if you love to and want a nice dive bar that is family owned and friendly, I suggest you go here. I truly had a great time.",2
"Not as extensive a collection of yarns,but not too shabby either. Lots of fabric for the seamstress as well. Tons of knitting,crochet, and sewing supplies too. Here you'll find wool soaking solutions in various scents as well as jewelry clasps for your finished progects.Knitting classes are given 12.00 per hour,and there is a ""lounge ""area for those who'd like to sit and knit and chat for a bit.",2
"Extremely disappointing beer selection. For an Irish pub, I expected more than the usual Anheuser Busch products. They did have Heineken and Harps but the only darker option was Guiness and the tap was broken. The place particularly the restrooms seemed a little dirty. Food was boring. I will not be visiting this place for happy hour again.",1
"This show is TERRIBLE! I fell asleep. I don't understand how this show has survived so long, it was a choreographic disaster. No tricks, no stunts, terrible dancing, and boring boring boring. I went with 6 other people and we all HATED IT, including a 10 year old who said it was the worst thing she's ever seen.",1
"This is my least favorite sushi place in the valley. I think gas station sushi would have tasted better. The edamame wasn't cooked properly and had too much salt, the tuna in the Alaskan roll tasted like it came straight out of a can, and the soda was flat. The only thing that tasted okay was the water.",1
"Not sure if this is because the pharmacy is so busy all the time since it's in a great location, but I've experience some pretty long wait times and some pharmacists and technicians that seem to have no patience and a short fuse. I've only had one decent experience and that was at 8am wheo one was in the store. I'll try to go early in the morning more often. ",1
"Staff plays games with pricing. Internet ad cites take out specials for an entire pizza, but staff told me they know nothing about such specials. And they have the gall to stiff me for one slice. No thanks. I like honest merchants, who abide with their ads, their representations, and their product. Full of internet special gimmicks. AVOID. DO NOT BE MADE INTO A FOOL.",1
Edit nUpgraded from one star to 4 and removed my scathing review with a long and boring problem. In the end the manager Chris called me back and talked to me to make it right. It is nice to see a business take the time to fix a customers problem. I still prefer my membership at Clean Freak car wash but in a pinch this place will do nicely.,2
"This place is not worth the price. Fortunately, we did get one entree free by going to the place where you get cheap show tickets . Our filets mignons were overcooked and bland. The French onion soup was just ok. The dessert was good les fruits rouges , as was the cappucino. For the price, this place isn't worth it. The staff are very nice, but the food is lacking. Try somewhere else.",1
"745 on a Friday night with two of my buddies. We all got the fish fry plus some deep fried shrimp. Service was attentive, but everything seemed to go wrong. Out of sirloin and a certain beer. Forgot to give us the soup until after the entree arrived. Fish was average for the price, I couldn't imagine it was made to order. Cole saw sucked, it was soggy lettuce smothered in warm mayonnaise.",1
"I just bought a 10 play punch card on Mamapedia for Jump and Shout last month, and used it 2 times. Showed up yesterday to use it more and Jump and Shout is out of business. You would think they would put it on their website, but no. I think it stinks that they would advertize and sell 10 play cards when they knew they were not going to be around to honor them.",1
"This church is close to our home but the community is just to large compared to what I am used to. The parish community is friendly and welcoming but due to its large size just overwelming. The mass and music are not traditional to what I am accustom to, but are instead more contempary. I have been to Catholic churches in various states and countries.",1
"What a really cool surprise! We stopped here on a lark and found a real gem of a place. The food was fresh and tasty. I had the 1 2 sandwich, soup and salad bar. It was great. The soup tasted like homemade. It was very good. The help was wonderful. If you are passing through Gila Bend. definately check this place out.",2
Love sweet tomatoes just not this one. Smaller than most and out of everything. Dirty and no service. Beware of the ice cream machine just got chocolate sprayed allover my new shirt. Wanted vanilla but yep was out of that too. Sad when a salad place runs out of ranch. I'll still eat at sweet tomatoes but not that one.,1
"The Chandler Fashion Center Printing House is the cadillac of gyms.Not only do they have the typical Chandler gym amenities rows of the latest equipment, trendy classes, and an on site juice bar, but they also have a full spa and rooftop pool. Additionally if you're feeling achy in between sets, there's a guy giving chair massages near the stretching mats. Hands down my favorite gym in the city.",2
"Not only has my flight been cancelled trying to get to Orange County, California twice in less than a year, most recently I was in contact with three others who had significant flight delays the same day I did. Not only is Southwest no longer reliable, its prices haven't been competitive in the past 3 years or so.",1
"We stumbled on this adorable bakery after having reflexology next door! We were pleasantly surprised at the delicious pastries. Esp the cream cheese breakfast loaf. Too die for! We sat, had espressos and tried dif pastries. What a great girls day! YUMMY! nOh, and the owner is so very nice! nWe will definetly be back! And soon!",2
"Another great neighborhood restaurant in Las Vegas. I've only been twice for lunch but the food was outstanding. My personal favorite is the ""Pulpo "" Octopus salad but we had a really great pizza as well. Service is excellent, and the owner is almost always there and it shows in the quality of food and service Jason",2
"This was my first time at this location, but I was impressed, The staff were friendly and helpful, and even moved tables around to accomodate our large group. They were also very good at keeping waters refilled, chip baskets topped off, and food arriving hot and fresh. Even the numerous unusual requests and separate checks barely phased them. They must come from the planet of Krypton or something.",2
"Stick to what Monsieur Phillipe is good at sweets! The light, grab and go options paninis wraps salads are painstakingly average and not worth the splurge. On the other hand, you will not regret going for anything chocolate. If you are having trouble deciding, the staff are incredibly knowledgeable about method of preparation and ingredients used.",2
"Did take out for lunch. Ordered the Pastrami Burger, was our favorite at the Sandwich Shop in Page Az. Really good burger! Saved the BBQ Salad for dinner, taste tested it before putting it in the frig. Chicken had a very good flavor and the ingredients were fresh. Live in Central Phoenix always looking for local restaurants to support. Staff was very friendly.",2
"If you need to stay near the Phoenix Airport, this is an excellent choice. The rooms are big, clean, and comfortable. The wifi is free and works well. The staff is good. The only problem is there are no shops or places to eat around it. If you have a car, no problem at all. Free airport shuttle is nice also.",2
This was the worst philly cheese steak I ever had as soon as I discovered a metal bag tie inside the meat half way through eating the sandwich luckily I could spit it out before I started chocking on it and would have had to go to the hospital. This is not what I expected for an 11.99 plus tax sandwich. See attached picture,1
Have to say that after a long search my good friend recommended Dr Roa and so we drove on over and finally have my bad broken infected Molar out. The prices are amazing and I will be going back to have a chipped tooth repaired for under 200.00. Last time I had it fixed I paid close to 500.00 at a dentist in Surprise. Thank you Dr Roa and staff for treating me with such kindness.,2
I was told to try this place out they made the best reubens. I got my ruben on white bread they didnt even ask what type of bread I just assumed it be on rye. meat tasted yuck and they didnt put anything on it ! you had to go and get package condiments. It was pricey and then all you get is a bag of packaged chips. Really? disappointed,1
"The one star is for nothing more than the staff. The facility is great, always clean, and the range is always in descent shape when you go to your lane. But every single staff member here seems to hate their life. I don't expect u to constantly wear a smile but don't talk to your customers like they are idiots.",1
"My go to place for boba! Their prices are really worth it. Their large is like a 32 oz and it's 4.25, there's no going wrong with that! They use real fruit and there's something about the boba they use in thier drinks. No matter how long you leave it's in there it doesn't get hard, it's always soft and chewy. Mmm.",2
"PHOENIX this is officially the closest gas station to PHX airport rental car return! For this reason I give it two stars. Otherwise it is just a crummy little gas station with outdated pumps, lousy drink selection, lousy candy selection, lousy food selection, and a terrific selection of indecent men's magazines.",1
"Surprisingly tasty Indian food and a really good price. Pretty sure it's buffet only. We stayed at the Hampton Inn on the other side of the parking lot and stopped in for lunch one afternoon. Definitely worthwhile if you have a hankering for some Indian food outside of Toronto. You can't really get away with bad Indian food in these parts, can you?",2
"The highlight was that there was no cover for ladies. Everything else was kind of.weird. The service was bad we waited for a long time at our table and again at the bar. The food was average and the drinks were more expensive than what I'm used to. There was live music which was nice. Overall, it felt uncomfortable. I won't be back but to each his own!",1
Very disappointed this year 2014 . Both fish dinners had strong fish. Unlike in the past cheap salad dressing used Ken's . Another major disappointment was that the pistachio Greek casserole was NOT included in the meals this year. All this with an increased admission price to 3 per person. My family won't be back next year! Karl M.,1
"Great view, good tunes, would be a great place if the bouncers weren't such assholes and super rude. Paid for bottle service which isn't cheap . The least you would THINK you would get is common decency. Wouldn't go back based on the crappy treatment and utter lack of respect demonstrated by the 'bouncers'. Click",1
"I watched Aziz Ansari here, and could not stop laughing throughout the entire performance. I realize a single act can't justify how good a theater is, but the seats were comfortable and the setup was pretty. Overall, I would probably rate this experience as the best 80 dollars i've ever spent in Vegas.",2
"My wife's doctor told us about this little gem, so we confirmed on Yelp. We've now had 2 doctor appointments here for my son, absolutely love his pediatrician, the office and staff, and are very happy with our decision to come here. We know several people who take their kids here as well and rave about how they love their doctors here.",2
Went here at 11 30 and noone was here music was wack my friends and I was having a full convo u00a0in the club because the music wasnt even that loud . to be honest if I can here my friends talk from a distance u know is bad. dont come here so glad I was on the guess list because they charge ppl 20 if u dont live in las vegas.,1
The crazy management expected us to pay 10 to park at the outlets because the Cardinals were playing today. Result is no 10 and a loss of several hundred dollars of revenue to Gendale. I hope the Peoria mall is more accommodating and I hope Glendale figures out how to manage parking around sporting events because this just seems goofy.,1
"Wonderful food, great ambiance, fabulous service! This could be my new favorite place for breafast brunch. We both had the ham quiche and oh my was it ever yummy! The mini croissants and jam were just as good. The complimentary chocoate cake with vanilla ice cream rounded out a perfect meal. And the price can't be beat 22 for two meals and drinks. I'm heading back next weekend!",2
The food is fantastic and I've come here for years. My boyfriend also caever get enough of this place. I love the fact that its unique to Phoenix which is why I always take visitors here. They are also generous with samples. I would not change anything about the food. I wish the ambiance was a little nicer though. Maybe a repainted wall here or there or new tables or chairs?,2
"Yes their food is good but not worth being bitten time after time by spiders. Me and the girls I ate with were bit many times on our legs, when I told the manager he did nothing about it and just said they try to keep the bugs out but it's ""difficult "". Then just shrugged me off. Worse experience ever!",1
"One of the best asian restaurants in Pittsburgh! The portions are generous, the service is fast and friendly, the decor is stylish and classy and the food is fresh and delicious. The prices are a bit high, but you definitely get premium gourmet food for the premium price. I haven't had a single thing on the menu that didn't impress me!",2
Absolutely delicious poutine. I decided to try the crush potatoes instead of the traditional fries and it was fantastic. I also opted for all of the cheeses on offer as it was no extra to have a mix. WOW. The best poutine I have had in Montreal yet. You must try it! Oh and the service was brilliant too.,2
"Everything about this place is top notch. Great doughnuts, cupcakes and pastries along with really good pizza and ice cream. What's not to love? A great place to make a quick stop in for a box of doughnuts or cupcakes to take to work or to give to friends. The staff is the real star though. Great people who do their best to get you in and out in a hurry with your tasty treats!",2
"I have been a going to Ted's since 1999 when I moved to AZ and absolutely love the all beef hotdog and the burgers are juicy and delicious. Their malts are really thick and to die for. You might need a spoon or let it melt a little because they can be a little thick at times. Best hotdog restaurant I have come across in AZ, hands down.",2
"I would not give this place one star, they have sent me to a collection agency for 60.00 which they say I owe and I do NOT and I refuse to pay for a missed appointment which I did not miss so I am getting harassed for 60 bucks and put it on my credit report. To make matters worse I thought Dr Cohen was awful as a doctor.",1
"This is a nice, cozy store. The macaroon sells for 1.50 each. There's a very large selection of flavors and the lady working there was very helpful by helping me translate each flavor. I ate them days after getting them and they were still very delicious! I would definitely come back again if I'm in the area.",2
i thought pharmacists were supposed to help people. if i could give less then 1 star i would. the woman here treats every patient like a drug addict. my sister had just got out of the hospital after having her gall bladder removed and this woman wouldnt fill her prescription. i would go anywhere but here. and i wish i could do more than just leave this review.,1
"I was really looking forward to the hype of coffee bean but when they gave me regular milk when I ordered soy I wasn't a very happy camper. Also the drink I got was WAY to sweet. Free WiFi 1 star, ask employee at the register to print you the password username. Mistakes happen and maybe I'll come back someday.",1
"Got time in the airport? Monkey know you do. Get chocolate! Take the free sample and buy the CHOCOLATE COVERED PEANUT BRITTLE. You will thank yourself later. Service is nothing but friendly and helpful. Not cheap, but terrific quality. Invest in your flight crew with Ethel M's. A little kindness goes a long way!",2
"We were calling up to get information about the brunch buffet costs, we were told that a child is half off. When we said a 1 year old costs 17 bucks to eat? the worker Nikki laughed under her breathe and said yes. What poor customer service, and what business charges a one year old 17 bucks for a brunch buffet? I've never heard of that.",1
"I can't believe this place is rated so low. Other than the wait I couldn't ask for more in a breakfast joint. Their chicken fried steak is the size of Texas and really isn't that expensive. I could also eat their biscuits and gravy all day. To me, all breakfast food is pretty much the same but this place is like Denny's on steroids.",2
"Just glad we still have a descent malaysian restaurant around. For those of you that remembered Banana Leave, it was my favorite malaysian place. When it suddenly closed its doors I was emotionally devasted and have been searching for a new malaysian favorite. Island Malaysian has stepped up to fill that void.",2
"I really like the ambience here, so I'll probably be back for drinks. But the food is awful. My burger wasn't cooked right, suffered from too much grease and resulting sogginess , and the garnish was mostly composed of a GARGANTUAN lettuce butt. It really peeved me to think that a person with any cognitive abilities at all would slap that on a burger. Two thumbs WAY down.",1
This guy was very rude on me on the phone when asking about HOW TO GET HIM PAID! He then started doing work not covered on the home warranty without calling me with estimate or information. He was only apologetic when confronted on his behavior. Will not be using him ever again. he was though very nice when he told me what he would be charging me for work he didn't ask to do!,1
"Really, to be honest I wish the food was better than 2 stars, only because I am sick of the large chain restaurant down the road. So the atmosphere was kind of cheesy and well the food, I may have made better food nuked by myself. It was very bland, and way too pricey for the lack of superb quality. Sticking with the big chain for now.",1
"This is the place your grandparents will love, your parents will love, and you well, you will not. It's kind of like Grandma's kitchen in chain fashion. It's consistent like Kendo U. said, but I wouldn't say it's good by any means. It's bleh. It's chain bleh. Service is nice and they are hardly ever busy, but I prefer busy and bad service to bleh food. BLEH.",1
Coconuts Beach Bar.went on a Wednesday night and it was dead. Of course it was 30 minutes before closing when we showed up but the bartender was super nice and hospitable. Used our free dessert from checking in and got the churros.YUMMY! to eat with our margaritas. The establishment was very well maintained and looked clean. I will definitely be back again on my next visit to Vegas!,2
"If you're expecting the Broken Egg experience as found in Destin, you'll be disappointed. My eggs for eggs Benedict were overcooked, and the potatoes were straight from a bag in the freezer unlike Destin where they were prepared in house . Service was good and food was okay, but definitely not what I was expecting.",1
decent food and atmosphere. The downside is sitting there watching the Gilbert Police pull people over on Gilbert Road as they leave the main entrance into that shopping area. In the course of just over an hour there were 3 cars pulled over. Once again the Barney Fifes of Gilbert ruin business for a great place. I will not go back there just to end up being a target of the GPD.,2
Had the Chicken fried steak after seeing so many reviews. It was very good. Next time I will have the biscuits and gravy. The same gravy comes on both and boy IS IT GOOOOOD! The service staff is friendly and the it did not take long to get our meals. Good food at a good value. Not much more you could as for.,2
"Wandering through the sea of humanity, we approach the Fundome. Promises of merriment and joy seem immanent, but our hopes were cruelly dashed. Just a sad, tired time and money sink. The rides weren't worth it, and the other attractions aren't interesting outside of Vegas in a real circus.why would I want to do them in Vegas?",1
"Incredibly horrible service. Took 45 minutes to get food, which was just a sandwich. Never planning on returning to this location. Even after the order came out, it had a salad instead of onion rings and there was mayo on it which I can't eat because I'm lactose intolerant. Staff is either incompetent or totally disregards customers",1
"Not at all as the pictures portray. It is just a cheaply remodeled apartment. The pool areas, rooms, bathrooms do not resemble a resort or hotel. You can hear the maids, neighbors and all the cars in the parking lot. The room and bathroom was very small and the TV had choppy reception. Not a relaxing time at all. I would not recommend this place at all.",1
"I was in town for a conference and my birthday so i wanted something fun for my colleagues and I to enjoy. We fell in love with them! They we the most delicious, most, and tasty cupcakes! You also get a slight buzz. hehehe. They dropped on of my cupcakes and replaced it but also gave me 2 free cupcakes! they were awesome and super nice! I will order from you everytime I am in Vegas.",2
Time after time this store continues to disappoint. I needed a pair of shorts so I decided to try this store again. I had great customer service last week and it gave me hope that this store had turned around. I return this week only to find that the customer is not priority here. I will go back to shopping online.,1
"Nice, quiet, clean, pretty. nMy daughter gave birth to my grandson here. I stayed during the duration. What a great experience from this perspective! nThe nurse and doctor were wonderful. I felt at ease by their presence. It was not easy seeing my daughter like this. The result is more that I could have imagined. nIf you get hungry and have time to eat, the cafeteria had very good choices.",2
"First time trying their online ordering system for a delivery. They got both the pizza and the salad wrong. When I say I don't like anchovies, I mean I don't like anchovies. I didn't order anchovies. I ordered artichokes. I got anchovies. Called the manager who did not even offer a hint of an apology but gave a small refund. Luckily there are plenty of other places to choose from.",1
" Why does LA Fitness close at 8 pm on the Weekends? .That is so Lame! .Phoenix is the 5th largest city in the U.S., yet it closes sooo early!. At least 9 pm just makes more sense!. and, it's still pretty busy right up 'til 8 pm on the weekends. Phoenix really is such an early city! Seems like everything closes early! That's one thing I hater about Phoenix!",1
"I am a fan. They quickly told me that my very old iPod would cost about 80 to order and replace to logic board, and that that may only help identify further problems. He spoke my language with tech equipment and agreed that it really isn't worth fixing. He was honest with me rather than shamelessly make my money. For that, I would recommend that anyone go there.",2
"They only get one star since yelp won't let you grade lower! Worst nail salon I have ever been in! Fastest most unrelaxing 'deluxe spa pedicure and manicure' that I have ever received they rush you in and out. Constantly trying to sell you additional services, rude to guest, and they cut the side of my nieces foot during her pedicure. Would never go back!",1
"Okay.so if you've followed my gastro journal for any length of time, you can attest to the fact that I tend to focus on the brighter side of food, keeping negative reviews short and delicate. Yet, when a restaurant puts out food with prices that warrant a 5th yelp dollar sign, let's just say I am tougher to please.",1
"Very good sushi menu and excellent quality food. Great service. Wine list is very limited one white house, one red house etc and could be better but beer selection is good Asian and domestic . Will definitely be back. If you do decide to do a better wine list, please include an oakey Chardonnay like Sonoma Cutrer!",2
"What a suprising little place! The outside of The Holyrood doesn't look like much but inside is fantastic kind of like the more famous Holyrood . I sat down at got myself the Texas BBQ burger last week. A huge portion with bacon, chilli's and cheese platers all over it filled in up in one course. They had desert, but I was io shape to attempt it. At just under u00a37 it was a bargin too!",2
" ""The place for Birthdays in Madison. Get a free mug with soda or beer depending on your age with a balloon attached and drink 'til you drop. Great burgers, especially the kid's sized mini burgers which are perfect for me. Great crowd, reminds me of Cheers in a way. Take a big group for dinner when you are starting out that 21 bar crawl. The owner Marty Shapiro is a Madison celebrity. 5 stars. """,2
"I'm not a fan of the way the owners handle their business. A few years ago I had a great experience at their Payson branch, the manager was very sweet and even gave me a chance to donate money to the local schools through my insurance company. Sadly it was closed when I went back recently so I went to the Phoenix office. They were very rude and not helpful.",1
"I don't get it. When people here that I am from Chicago they ALL recommend Oregano's. My husband works near the Shea location and brought a pizza home. The crust was super thin which I like, but it lacked pizzazz. I like deep dish, pan, thin crust, super thin, etc, but I did not like Oregano's. Also, they are more on the expensive side.",1
"Good food, no complaints. I was suprised though that half of the items offered weren't Chinese at all fruit, pudding, dessert, fries. I was a little disappointed that it cost us over 6 for my three year old to eat some fruit and a bowl of ice cream, but oh well. I would come back, just without the kids.",2
"Oh AMC grand you sure have lost your lustre. At one time you were the best on par with Harkins and somewhere between the early 00s to now you're not exactly pageant queen material, more of the festival parade queen. Your stadium seating although relevant is not as comfortable as Harkins. Wish you were the camelback esplanade coz that's the grand dame.",1
I used to go in here quite a bit and thought it was pretty good but hadn't gone for awhile. I was really disappointed. My chicken chow mien was the flat noodles and extremely dry and sticky. They were stuck together in one big clump. It was nasty. The pork fried rice was mediocre. Won't be going back.,1
Great place to hang out. Real neighborhood y. Usually able to find some great conversation at the bar with total strangers drinkining alone. Great place to head over to if the Roosevelt's servers are angrier thaormal. Greatest strength Dogfish Head 90 on tap! This is actually responsible for 90 of why I love going to Carly's.,2
"The outside setting is very good, in a Plaza. Great for warm nights. The inside seating, not so good. We had the Philly cheese steaks it's in the name! and I was disappointed. Not enough taste, and not enough cheese. Overall, pretty ""papery "" taste. In addition, the service was subpar, the beer menu was out of date and the one that I was able to order came out warm and flat.",1
"I went for a shave and haircut and it was a decent haircut and I requested a straight razer shave and they said no. Also the atmosphere was horrible, the music, and the ladies were speaking spanish non stop also there was a kid of the worker here messing around. I will not return here nor I suggest anyone come here.",1
"Seriously, the WORST customer service ever. I swear the ""Sales Rep "" Ginny did everything possible to NOT sell me a refridgerator. Besides being rude and not so intelligent, Ginny was slow and didn't care one way or another what happened. Employees are few and far between and when you do find one, good luck if they know what they are talking about.",1
"I've been here many times throughout the years with my family. They have a huge selection of food with many interesting combinations and varieties. My favorite is the Japanese tofu dish, it is a must try! Unlike many chinese places, King Tin doesn't serve greasy foods, always staying healthy and delicious! The restaurant is convenient for university students but the parking is a bit of a pain.",2
"Great coffee, laid back atmosphere. Lots of seating. Quiet. It's an almost perfect coffeeshop. Only thing that would make it better on my list would be if it was just a little more hippie and counterculture. but that's just me. They have a large collection of travel and stainless coffee mugs. If I lived in Madison this would definitely be one of my hangouts.",2
"Was all willing to give your over priced super salty empanadas another shot at glory, man. But when called recently, over an HOUR past your stated open, no one picked up. I've worked pizza and deli places know how it can be. Tried four more times to get through. Screw you, Manolos, we are so over. Don't come crawling back next week with your lame excuses.",1
I have been ordering from wingsover for the past month and they are awesome! EVery order that I placed was at my door within the hour and the food is delicious and priced accordingly. The wraps have delicious crispy chicken and the wings meat is very tender and well cooked. We get wings from here rather than Pizza Milanos because of the better variety of sauces and great food.,2
It's was clean. Needed some cosmetic maintenance. Loud air conditioner. Warm hallways. Good breakfast. Comfortable beds. Nice staff. Great location for a Carowinds visit. Walking distance from the gate. Next door to an amazing liquor store! Pizza delivery and 7 11 also walking distance. So the location is the best. Parking lot had big potholes. n But I would stay here again. ,2
Worst experience EVER.it was made clear to me that that the only way for them to make money was taking a percentage of the costs of repair.therefore being over charged and told serrvices were needed that really werent needed at all! They are a bunch of crooks. WISH I could give negatie stars. Never again.,1
"Vahe is awesome! We just had two IPad 2 repaired and the battery replaced in an iPhone 4 all in less than 2 hours time. His service is first class. He cares about the customer, the product and his work, which is exceptional. I highly recommend his service to anyone with repair needed on an Mac product.",2
"This Chili's Too! sure beats the one in the DFW airport though that is not saying much . It is bigger, and they have much more variety on their menu. The one drawback with the size of the restaurant, it is easy to get forgotten. I went with the fajitas, which were okay for airport food. This Chili's Too! also features cute waitresses with great Southern accents.",1
we were strolling down the shopping area of montreal on rue st catherine on an early morning in the summer when we stopped in for some authentic french crepes! we ordered two and had left over as they are pretty large. i prefer my crepes on the crispier side but it was good nonetheless! i would definitely come back when i'm in montreal again!,2
"This real estate mortgage team is a well oiled machine and totally in sync! Justin, Christina Jarrod are awesome to work with and have a full knowledge of their business and know how to bring a loan to a close. I highly recommend this mortgage team for anybody looking for a home mortgage. Thanks again Justin for making this a reality it was greatly appreciated! JK",2
"Go buy a honda at any other dealership except this one, they have shitty customer service and overpriced Hondas and salesman that get intimidated when I talk to his customer and he thinks I'm trying to talk him out of buying the car he's trying to sell. Are u F cking kidding me. Get a real job lol hahaha 9.00 a hr",1
"Ate here 2 times, first time we were wondering what so good about this buffet compared to Rio's Paris and others needless to say we did not like it as much. n2nd time we tried gave it another chance and for some reason it was really good and we thought they probably had some change in cooks or something cuz it was that good. Will be coming back soon!",2
"Very little Salmon on Ceasar salad for 15. Pizza came to us cold 20 minutes after they brought salad. Overpriced, but good atmosphere. Waitstaff young and not trained well. Ordered from one guy and by the end of the meal five people had stopped by our table. We didn't know who was waiting on us. Overall, the service was good, the food marginal, and the parking to get there atrocious.",1
My parents took me for dinner. My mom and dad ordered the fish and I got the cobb salad. The fork that they gave me had dried food on it. Really disgusting and quite gross. The salads took over 10 minutes to arrive. We were never offered refills on our drinks. At least the food tasted pretty good. Will not go back for a while.,1
"NEWEST CLUB IN VEGAS! i really like the set up! as a girl, it was easy to get in w a promoter 2 free drink tickets for girls free admission! AWESOME opening dj but I didn't catch his name the headliner Zedd didn't come out too late which helps! NOTE the bass is a bit TOO pumped . im pretty sure i lost a lot of ear cells!",2
"I've had the really thing a Philly cheesesteak in Philly and I've had some good imitations at the Philly Cheesesteak Shop in Fresno, CA, and a similar take out shop in Waikiki, HI, of all places. But this place doesn't measure up. Bland meat, soggy fries and not enough onions and peppers on the sandwiches. Totally forget about it. At least it's open 24 hours. I'll give them one thumbs up for that.",1
"My boyfriend LOVES this place. I like it because they always have amazing customer service. We went this last week, it was suuuper busy and they forgot our onion rings and bacon on our burger. BUT the manager came by apologized and took it off our bill without even asking. I thought that was very nice of him! We will go back because of the customer service.",2
"UPDATE For 7 years, I have been calling Stan, Vincent. and every time, he laughs and corrects me. This may make me sound ignorant, but I swear, I have been consistently calling this guy the same, incorrect name, since the week I moved to Vegas Sorry Stan! nI love you and all the work you do. Please accept my apology and continue to operate a fantastic establishment!",2
"We visited the gallery for the recently concluded exhibit Paining Women. The exhibit included works on loan from MOFA in Boston with Mary Cassatt, Georgia O'Keeffe and Berthe Morisot being the featured artists. It is was an interesting exhibit, but hardly among the best we have seen at this gallery.",1
"I had the pleasure of dining at Alep a couple of weeks ago with a small group of people. We were there for my girlfriend's birthday and by all accounts, it was a wonderful and very satisfying evening. Everything from the service to the food to the price was top notch. I can't recommend Alep highly enough. We will definitely be back sometime soon!",2
HATE Nothing. DISLIKE Space is inefficient and somewhat poorly designed lots of room but limited seating . Chicken katsu is on a stick. The funny friendly manager is not behind the counter anymore. LIKE The mochiko chicken. The actual chicken katsu. The sin city shrimp appetizer. The furikake shrimp. The different sauces offered. LOVE The combo bentos boxes. The fried rice bar. The portion sizes.,2
"I love FEZ! Great trendy upbeat atmosphere. I've been here many times brunch, lunch and dinner. The food and service is fantastic. I usually get the garlic hummus and pita as an appetizer and a burger for lunch. They're burgers are fantastic and you can taste the freshness. Nice outdoor seating area too.",2
Don't come here during graveyard the last two times we came here we got the worse service. Two bartenders and not one will come up to us. One was talking to girls for over a hour and other guy didnt come to West side of the bar. I'm a bartender and I would be ashamed if I gave a customer this kinda service. We will never step foot inside Road Runner on W. Flamingo Rd ever again. Thank you.,1
"I shop here every few weeks to stock up on things that I cannot find at other stores ie the great gluten free selection and organic produce. I also like to buy nuts in bulk and there is a wide selection. Prices are higher than your average grocery store, but a much better selection as a whole. It's just too bad that we have to pay more to eat more healthy.",2
"I found Dr. Natcher on Yelp. Her location is convenient to my work and I was pleased with the office personnel and the doctor. I have been having right foot pain since May and have never had treatment. Today I got treatment xray, foot wrap, and othotic, and good advice. I am very pleased and will recommend Dr. Natcher.",2
"I had lunch with 4 friends. The service was bad we had to call out in chorus to get the waitress's attention after she delivered the food. She never checked on the table again, or even looked our way. I ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings. She delivered french fries instead. The hamburger had gristle and unpleasant hard things in it when I bit down. Ugh.",1
I stayed in the hotel for a couple of nights. They could have used more people checking people into their rooms. The overall layout of the room was good the air conditioning didn't really work and the beds were little hard. They need to make the self parking bigger. The buffet breakfast could have been better. The Casino floor could have been a little cooler.,1
"It's a nice convenient place to grab breakfast or lunch on your way to the office. My main complaint was they require a 10 minimum purchase to use a credit card. So basically you need cash on you to go here. That was really the only thing I didn't like about the place, other than that the food was pretty decent.",2
"I love the simplicity of this small sandwich shop. Expect to pay around 7.50 per meal, which isn't bad, but maybe a little too much for the simple sandwiches. The sandwiches are great, don't get me wrong, but it's nothing I can't whip up on my own at home with some better than Walmart groceries. Good, fun, clean place in a nice location. It's worth stopping by if you're in downtown Mesa.",2
"Great place for kids to play they offer a 2 military discount for each child as well. The play areas are kept clean and even when they are extremely busy there is no mess evident. What I was most amazed by however, was the ability for so many kids to get along I rarely witnessed any tantrums or fighting among children. It was a great experience!",2
Fly here a lot on TED. The terminal sucks. When you are hanging out layed over there is nothing to do or eat. They did remodel but it is just as bad as before. I am stuck flying into here everymonth. One of the good things is there was a smoking room but that got demolished so now you can smoke post checkpoint outside.,1
The food was good and the waitress was nice. But this restaurant was not clean. We were the first and only people in the restaurant on a Saturday morning and the tables were nasty. The floors had trash all over them. There was dust around the windows and possible old ketchup. I won't come back to this location. The one on east blvd is much cleaner.,1
"I love that This place has a Huge Mega Stuffed Veggie Burrito and Awesome Staff as Well.Everytime I've ate here nothing short of Polite Women Cooks Waitresses.Real home cooking and perfect if you live in ""SaasSide "".5 times that I was here just Great all around Stop in here and you won't be let down.Cheers Friends",2
"Wish i could put a big fat zero . Stood in line for 15 mins to place an order for two italian subs and they have NO FREAKIN ITALIAN MEAT. Its a wed for god sake. How can you not have supplies. Not doing that ever again. Went across the street to Niccolis, they have better Italian anyway! Please ho somewhere else.",1
"Chicken kabob, baba, must o khiar, falafel, baklava, hummus, all really good. If it did not feel a little ""fast foodie "" it would be better. nI recommend the chicken kabob highly. The baklava is, according to my wife, fantastic. The hummus was good, and the baba ganoush was awesome. nI will be going back.",2
"So i went to this place for my birthday. my expectations were set high and sadly it did not meet. I assumed the meals would be large in portions and the prices to me neutral but was the complete opposite. The food was not that good especially for the prices. I did enjoy the decor though! ALSO the ""frozen hot chocolate "" was a let down i expected different.",1
Beware vegetarians you are subject to a crappy salad or an ok cheese sandwich only veggies they have are lettuce and tomatoes . The potato salad and coleslaw also leave something to be desired. My meat eating counter parts advised that the soup was the only thing that they would go back for. Save your money and go elsewhere.,1
"The reason for 2 stars. Order accuracy! My food has been wrong the last 3 times! I ordered 3 quesa tacos for my lady and me. We ordered 2 shrimp and 1 carnitas. We got 2 beef and 1 carnitas. The server said the ticket was correct. This is the third time this happened! Don't get me wrong, the food is great but you also should get what you order the first time.",1
"I fully agree with Ted's review of Jersey's. I love a bar that offers fun things to do while having some drinks! Between pool, Wii, and Cornhole aka Bags there's always fun to be had here. On Tuesday nights after 9 30 they provide free homemade tacos which are quite tasty. And kudos to the owner for providing a free shuttle to from your home to prevent customers from drinking and driving!",2
"This place sucks! We ordered a medium pepperoni pizza. what'd we get? a medium pepperoni pizza. barely any sauce and extra EXTRA extra cheese X3. It was loaded with so much cheese, it was disgusting. I never thought I could hate cheese so much. I guess next time i'll have to say ""add sauce. light on the cheese "" if there is a next time . Just thinking of that pizza makes me gag. ugh.",1
"Cheap food doesn't make up for quality especially in this instance. The one saving grace is the customer service. Pretty sure chicken comes pre cubed pre packaged food is otherwise bland and tasteless. Salsa virtually has no flavor how is that even possible? I wouldn't recommend this place, although I can see it appearing on TV with Gordon Ramsay.",1
"Authentic, delicious. If you like spicy Chinese food this is the place for you! There are dishes that are not spicy also, but Szechaun cuisine is all about the heat! This region specializes in spicy food. If you don't like spicy, or can't handle it, I understand but you're missing out. Definitely coming back here.",2
"The only place in town where your car comes out dirtier than it went it. Don't waste your money here, it's awful. There was dirt still left on the outside of our car, and the inside was filthy from someone's dirty hands. They didn't vacuum or wipe anything down. I can get a better car wash for 5 elsewhere",1
"My one star is based on price compared to quality. In addition to kind of a dumpy place with too many staff asking what they can do for me. they charge about 12 for internet and 25 for parking. nHonestly, for the 200 it costs to stay there, you would think they could improve the smell in the hallways too.",1
"We went to Joe Hooper's for the first time on a Friday night. It wasn't too busy meaning fast, friendly service. They had an amazing outdoor area with lots of TVs inside and outside . We just took advantage of their 3 well drink special and ordered some crisp and tasty tator tots. We can't wait to go back and try some of their hearty dishes when we're a bit hungrier.",2
"We walked into this Disney ""Outlet "" store expecting to get a good deal. Boy, were we disappointed. Imagine our shock when we took a look at the price tags. The merchandise here actually costs MORE than the regular Disney store in Honolulu! I thought the point of an Outlet store was to offer items at a LOWER price. Won't bother coming here again.",1
"The old saying you get what you pay for definately fits this place. They shorten the time, it isn't as advertised and I have yet to have a decent male therapist. I was talked into a membership so will be quitting when that is up but will only have female therapists from this day forward. Expect an hour massage to be about 35 40 minutes.",1
"Wow! This place is not only the best eye candy for anyone addicted to organizing their stuff in a fashionable and individual way, but he people that work there were friendly, and knew their stuff. I have an odd shaped closet and they had not hesitations of how and what we could do to make it work for me. I would totally go back there when I buy my next home. Worth every penny.",2
"Stopped in to check out the store for the first time, and was extremely impressed. All of the display aquariums were spotless and esthetically pleasing to the eye. Staff was very friendly and available for help. The selection of livestock was large, very health, and well maintained! Entirely an excellent experience!",2
"Las Vegas is pure evil, embodying and embracing everything that is wrong with people. The view from the window seat as you're flying in says it all. Concrete, parking lots, pavement, strip malls, more concrete. The moment you step off the plane, the irritating flashing lights and endless ringing and dinging of slot machines greets you. You hardly need to walk 100 feet to start gambling.",1
"My first time ever hearing of Rita's, but I am glad we stopped. nThe custard is kind of like soft serve ice cream but creamier or more eggy, but in a good way . nThe staff was very friendly, and the Italian ice is really tasty with loads of revolving fun flavors. I came here twice in my week visit to Vegas and would for sure come again!",2
The food was above average I would definitely visit again. The portion size was great. I am a big eater and I was feeling very satisfied when I was done. Saw a lot of attractive ladies there too. I should give them negative 10 stars for taking away the delicious 5 breakfast burrito's on weekends. Shame on them for that! They were awesome.,2
"Let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVED the food. My dinner was spot on. So why the 2 stars? Quite frankly, it was way over priced. And I'm not talking about a few dollars too expensive. For an average dinner, you'll be spending 25 to 30. And while the food is tasty, the ambiance does not come close to warranting 30 per plate.",1
"Every time I fly into this airport, I dislike it more. Of all the places to connect, you think this would be the one of the nicest.it most certainly isn't. It's always crowded and filled with hung over hipsters. All the food I've had is awful and this place feels like purgatory. Avoid it if you can.",1
Went here last week with a group from work. The service was less to to be desired. When we spoke to the manager co owner took care a an issue we had but by that time the rest of our party left. We will not be back and I would not recommend going out of your way to go to the bar. There are other bars in the area that are 100x better in food and service.,1
"After a hellish series of holiday travel misadventures I arrived back in Phoenix and realized I had left my house keys in Iowa. Jeff was fantastic! He came out to my home, let me in and made me a new set of keys in less than 30 minutes. He provides such a great service! I hope no one ever finds themselves in that situation but if you do I would recommend Jeff 100 !",2
"I am not a big BBQ fan but let me tell you. Went in and ordered the Po Boy, they gave me a sample of the brisket. That was the best piece of meat I ever had. The sandwich was pretty darn good as well. Had a sausage link some brisket and some pulled pork. Was mighty tasty. Its a bit pricey though, 13 bucks for this beast but was delicious ! The sausage is a bit peppery but great flavor !",2
"We've been going to SONY for probably ten to twelve years, and i don't think i've had a bad pizza at this place. We get the lunch special sometimes or go there for a full pizza at dinner. I've never tried the sammiches or other pasta, although they look tasty when they pass by our table enroute to some other customer. I like that they all have patios that you can enjoy when the weather is nice.",2
I love this place. One of a kind vintage everything.even radios and telephones. I purchased a smancy little skirt from India and a nice necklace to match. A bit pricey but worth it. I love the plethora of costumes and accessories which can be rented as well as purchased. Had driven by the place manybtimes and I'm kinda upset that it had taken me so long to drop in.,2
"This is pretty much my favorite coffee shop ever. They also have some awesome non coffee drinks like smoothies and lemonade. I want to try everything on the menu but my love for the Suicide Smoothie strawberry, mango and peach keeps foiling my plans! Everyone here is really friendly and the atmosphere is super cool so why go anywhere else?",2
"Ich bin durch eine Anzeige in der KlappeAuf aus das Kesselhaus gesto u00dfen. nGro u00dfartig die Lokation, das Essen, die Weine, der NACHTISCH! nSelbst die Toiletten sind ein Erlebnis. Wenn es das Kesselhaus noch nicht geben w u00fcrde sollte man es dringend erfinden. nVielen Dank, wir kommen wieder !",2
"A pretty good selection e.g. green vegetables, sesame chicken, some more exotic items , but some staples were only mediocre like the egg rolls and I don't understand why they would have some things like french fries AND potato wedges and TWO kinds of Jell O. I wouldn't say the quality is top notch, nor the ambiance great. I wouldn't recommend it or go there again.",1
Only has 4 courts I go here once a year to watch the basketball tournament my fianc u00e9 coaches. The layout is ok but I wish they had the bathroom in the lobby. For parking there's an empty lot across the street you can park at. It doesn't get as crowded where you won't find a seat as an spectator. Lots of snack selection and their not overpriced. I would say decent.,2
"Disappointed. Never even got to try the food or table service for that matter. After waiting 30 minutes for a 20 minute wait, we discovered they had not written our name on the list when we checked in. Their solution was to offer our party of 3 ""open seating "" at the counter, where there was 1 open stool. Thanks. I won't go back. They seemed very busy, so I doubt they will miss my business.",1
"I usually dont complain because i used to be a server too. However me and my bf stop by this cafe before watching the dream show at wynWe ordered hot chocolate and americano and there was some texture in the hot chocolate. Maybe some fruit pulp or something. I told one of the staff and she gave me a dirty look and said ""do u want another one? "" Without apologizing very rude staff nnever goin back",1
"This is my Go To place for breakfast. nTasty bagels and they are quick. nI usually get the lox sandwich bagel. the lox has good flavor. not fishy and just the right amount of smoky ness. nThe husband usually gets the Original on Everything. eggs, sausage and cheese all on a fantastic bagel. nTheir bagels are not dough y but are big and filling.",2
NOT WORTH THE MONEY! We have no problem spending good money on food but this place was not worth it at all. It's disappointing because I think all the restaurants at Cosmo offer great food even secret pizza but this place is a disaster. Service is slow and food is barely average at best. Save yourself 150 for two people and eat somewhere appetizing.,1
"The baba ghanoush is incredible! . and an absolute bargain at 2.49. I am quite a connoisseur of this mediterranean specialty and this version is exceptional. The owner told me that is a 100 year old recipe, and it truly shows. nI also had the chicken shawarma and it was very good too. nWorth at least 4 stars, easily. nAnd the staff is very caring and friendly. nI will definitely be back.",2
We have been here several times and have liked there food. We went yesterday for lunch and was very disappointed. Do not get the fried zucchini. horrible! Spuds are gross too. Nothing special at lunchtime. Cracked egg is way better and so is egg and I. The service was not good either. Maybe they were just having a bad day I don't know. But we will not go back anytime soon.,1
"Not recommended. Mediocre food at somewhat high prices. Although the servers are usually friendly, they usually seem understaffed and never come around quite enough. Although the wings are pretty good, they are just not worth the trip. We wanted to like this place, and went a handful of times. However, after several lackluster trips, I doubt we will be back.",1
"This is one of the few places in Aria to get a late night snack. The restaurant decor itself in this place is kind of interesting, and this place is HUGE, but not all fully opened. The service is really bad. I asked for crackers with my soup, which I thought was a reasonable request, but felt like I was torturing the waiter. Food was ok, but pricey for what it was. Explore other options.",1
"The store is crowded. And the check out area is always crowded and understaffed. I miss the sales and coupons. nThe selections are okay. But if you don't fit into the junior old lady box, then it's hard to find something that will work. The Jean selection is horrible. nThe boys department is small in comparison to the girls. nBetter prices can be found elsewhere.",1
"Je suis europ u00e9en et je viens de d u00e9barquer a Mtl, une coll u00e8gue de travail, ma recommand u00e9 d'aller ici , et je n'ai pas u00e9t u00e9 d u00e9 u00e7us. nPas beaucoup d'attente pour u00eatre servi, serveuse sympa, de la place pour s'assoir et surtout le principal c'est vraiment BON! nJ'y retournerai ",2
"A much better than average breakfast, in a city that knows good brunches. Tasty cretons on toasted baguette, beans, eggs. I'll be back to try their specialties. Disappointed in the OJ though. And coffee was merely competent. But come early, come often, I know I'll be there, it's a friendly, noisy community gathering spot with delicious food. Kudos.",2
"Restaurant has a somewhat small buffet, but does offer an excellent selection. They have the BEST lo mein and fried rice! Not a huge fan of their crab rangoon a little too much cream cheese and their egg spring rolls are just okay. I love their teriyaki chicken, general tso's chicken and their chinese donuts! It's well worth it for just 8 something a person, and you can also order takeout!",2
This place beats bevmo's ass all the way to the bank. They have it all case closed. I have had several specialty items I have been looking for.not only did they have it but the staff knew what it was I needed right away and took me there without even having to think about it. Very knowledgeable and they have some cool wine tastings going on as well.,2
"This restaurant occupies an old post office on a quaint corner in a residential neighborhood. The menu is simple, mostly bruscettas and salads. I prefer going before 6pm when wine is 5. a glass. During the nice weather the door opens out to the patio and you can even bring your dog. The waitstaff are all friendly and there is no bad table. Don't walk, run!",2
"I just happened to be riding by the Midwood neighborhood and saw this food truck I thought it was a Mexican food truck. I quickly realized that wasn't the case I met the owner Kelli from Florida and she was very friendly she informed that her truck travels to Midwood, South park, and University I had a burger and really enjoyed it as well as the concept I' would recommend it.",2
"We went here on our first night in Vegas. We spent our money at better places. They have a wide selection of food. Some of the food was good like the crab legs, steak and potatoes were pretty good. The rest of the food wasnt that great. I could have gone somewhere else great with the money I spent here. I wouldnt go back to this place again!",1
"Not sure why the this place is over priced and bad bland food. 12.95 for beef basil? They don't use real Thai chili peppers, I like spicy and asked for it. They sprinkle Nasty old chill powder which ruined the dish. No flavor and not worth 12.95 Skip this place. Also called to let them know response was "" ok, is there anything else I can do for you? "" Wow what rude jerks!",1
"We ate there last night, the first time we've been back there in years. I Had fish and chips, YUK, they were greasy and tasted about as good as frozen fish. The fries were not crisp. My husband had the hamburger. It was OK but nothing great. The atmosphere in the restaurant is bland. We won't go back",1
"As a local, I have ate at many buffets and this is the buffet I love and recommend. Food is fresh and a huge selection. As a gluten free and vegan, I am often limited. Not at Wicked Spoon. You cannot get any better than Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. I love their vegetable section. And for my meat loving friends, they rave about the meat. My favorite is the presentation and the cleanliness.",2
Our first time here at this restaurant and we love it! The staff are well trained and very knowledgeable about what customers crave. Ask for Minh the manager! He is amazing guy! You gotta try their Banh Canh Tom Cua! It's the best! Bring the entire family and try what everyone is raving about! You will love it here! Enjoy and live free!,2
"This restaurant is a bit of a paradox serving higher end food as a buffet! Avoid too many starches so you don't get too full too fast. nAn important note is to try not to judge the food too much by the time you hit your third helping definitely save room for dessert, the specialty gelato was excellent!",2
Pretty good pizza for not a lot of money. Seating is nothing fancy. We were there on a Friday night and the place was busy from the time we walked in until we left. I thought we would have a longer wait for our order since they were so busy but no pizza was delivered much faster than expected. We will be back!,2
7pm Thursday 8 30. OUCH! I guess the chef was not there that night. Pad See Eew Chicken was nasty. My Thai wife was stunned how bad it was. Some white guy standing at the POS system register all night. Maybe it was just an off night. No Chang Beer sold out. Hmmmm. The servers pretty good that's about it. We will not be going back.,1
"Came here tonight with a few co workers and I must say that every dish that came out was amazing. They brought out this BBQ octopus and I have never ate octopus before it taste like chicken. The flat bread was good, the chicken was amazing. The service was amazing. Thank you Fleur for the amazing food.",2
"Sorry not the best pizza imo,If NY pizza is like this im sticking with Az pizza.Too much dough,barely any sauce,buffalo chicken did taste good.Good thing I used a Groupon wouldnt been worth the 17.99 then the owner wanted tax and gratuity on top for buying his pizza,wth?lot of frozen pizza better than this",1
"Great little spot with very simple and delicious food. The Greek sandwich is a must try, simply for the fantastic flavor of bleu cheese italian dressing on a sandwich. I also tried the lasagna and thought it was almost as good as mine.almost. Cheap beers if you've read my reviews, you know this is VERY important and super fast and friendly service round this place out.",2
"I went here once while I was in the area and the restaurant was in complete chaos. I presume the manager was not on site that day, as the handling of orders was completely out of control. After waiting in line for about 10 minutes to order my food, I just ended up leaving and going to another restaurant in the area.",1
"Here's the best value on the menu as far as I'm concerned Egg Foo Young, any kind. You get not one, not two, but three HUGE onion and sprout packed egg foo young patties, the size and thickness of a homemade hamburger, along with enough veggies and your choice of meat to make a whole second meal, all in a delicious brown sauce. Two gourmet chinese dinners for a paltry 7 or 8 dollars!",2
"Loved Bistro Pizza! I only wish there was a menu with pizzas with the toppings already chosen for you. I caever make up my mind on what toppings I want, they're all so good There is a significant difference in price oights with specials, if you're looking to save some money definitely check out their specials schedule. Touro students get a discount, don't forget that ID!",2
"Olive or Twist, a narrow bar tucked away in the Cultural District, has friendly service, reasonable prices, and pretty decent bar food. While it's not a sports bar per se, it's a great place to watch a game. like Game 7 of the Stanley Cup. Go Pens! If they renovated their bathrooms, they would definitely deserve a five star rating.",2
first time in my life I ever got brown lettuce at a Red Lobster. YUCK! oh well the rest of the meal was great and my server was prompt and offered to get me another ready mde salad but I'm sure the rest will be eaten by some one else until the fresh greens come out for fri night. Very clean and well lit place just brown lettuce really throws me or should I say tosses me?,1
"It's a nifty shopping center to walk around. The touch screen directory is pretty cool. And I like the new Christmas lights hanging from the ivy plants around the mall. they are mesmerizing. I'm afraid to walk into any of the stores because I know I can't afford any of it. But it's fun to window shop and it's home to one of my new favorite restaurants, Social House! Review forthcoming.",2
"This place is a must ""eat "". I had the green chili soup and the roast beef and blue cheese sandwich. Who knew you could get great green chili in Vegas. Next the roast beef sandwich was so good. The flavor of the melted blue cheese with the roast beef blended well and the soft bread made it that much better. Check this out if your in the downtown area.",2
"I went here for the first time on Saturday and I didn't like it. The place just does not have a good vibe. Staff members I encountered were nice and the performers were fun to watch, but other than that, this place feels like where dreams go to die. Maybe I don't understand the appeal. You also have to walk thru a crowd of smokers to get in or out.",1
"i came here late at night for the half price burritos and cheap huge ass margaritas. i had the angry hippy with portabella mushrooms. the food is tasty and the margaritas are delicious. it was a friday and it was packed. the atmosphere was lively and fun. the waitress bartender was really nice, fast, and very attentive.",2
"An overrated splurge of ingredients mixed with bright colors all puked over an oddly positioned location at the base of Caesar's Palace.this place is overrated like no other. A pile of sloppy, powder cheese nachos, some mountains of what they call ""frozen hot chocolate "" and 45 later, you're full and wishing you didn't just eat what you ate. So trendy, but all hyped up.",1
"This is my favorite buffet in Az and I have tried ALOT of them. The sushi is the best I have found at a buffet and I love the seared tuna. Korean BBQ, grilled sardines,chicken feet, frog legs, clams, shrimp, crab, and lots of chinese food. This place is always really busy which is good at a buffet as it keeps everything fresh.",2
"I've been going to this place for almost 10 years and they have always had a winning formula for their famous hot dogs and an easy meal. On work days, you need to get there before 11 30am or you'll be waiting an hour they cook the sausages on a grill right in front of you even though its sometimes 115 outside. Their home made shakes and onion rings are also a winner!",2
"My Garden veggie with mushrooms, blue cheese and all the fixings rocked my world! Just what I wanted, an all out veggie burger. They even have Coke Zero and delicious wedge fries with all kinds of dip jalapeno cheese? YES! And the chic at the counter Adrienne super nice and helpful.she even came out to check back on our happiness levels.",2
"I ordered the teriyaki chicken, which is apparently their specialty, and priced accordingly. It was 7 for a medium sized bowl and drink. The chicken was mediocre and the rice was kinda gummy. Even still, this wouldn't have warranted the one star until I bit into a chunk of bone that they forgot to sift out. Nasty.",1
"Service was absolutely wonderful. My husband and I were well taken care of by a group of three waiters servicing our table. The food was out of this world. I have spent time eating my way through Italy and, if I closed my eyes, couldn't have told you if I was in Rome or Las Vegas, Florence or The Wynn. Even the olive oil tasted fresh off the press.",2
"Second time there and again we were impressed. Our friends and us wanted to get away from the crazy crowds on the strip so we took a short drive to Ventano in Henderson. Glad we did. Great food, great view, and great service. My wife had the oysters to start which were delish. Eggplant dishes are good. The side of meatballs was very good too. I'll definitely go back for Italian food again.",2
"Our server was Kendra she was very informative offering recommendations and her favorites. When we realized we were running short on time she quickly accommodated us by getting our dessert to go. We had the grilled octopus, fried spinach salad, burrata, and portobello fries. Would order all again! They were all awesome! We had leftovers and took the dessert to go. We shall return!",2
Today I got the Cheesecake Factory and I had a pulled pork sandwich it was really good and so was the cheesecake but when I ordered my salad and it came with Thousand Island dressing the Thousand Island dressing literally tasted rotten and made me so sick I love going to the Cheesecake Factory but I will not return after this experience,1
"I used to come here all the time when I lived in the area. I usually order asada tacos, tortas, or their shrimp Coctel. All are really good, cheap and much better tasting than food I have tried at Roberto's. I crave their green sauce. It tastes good on everything! Oh yeah their agua de pi u00f1a is pretty good too. My only complaint is that the meat could be a bit more tender.",2
"Ooh don't come here for the fish and chips unless you like a vat a grease with them. I could practically squeeze it out of the limp fries and the fish was soaked as well. My mouth was coated in the rancid taste. Our waitress could barely expend any effort or enthusiasm. Needless to say, this is on our do not return list.",1
Will NEVER go here again. I was told they would take off a couple of skin tags for free. Well they submitted it to my insurance anyway. I ended up having to pay 75.00 in addition to the 65.00 I paid for the visit. A total of 140.00 for less than 10 minutes. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Then it took me over 6 months to get an answer about the billing. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.,1
"First time here. Heard the buzz and wanted to check out the hype. The Caniac Combo was more than fulfilling for the bf and I. Their sauce was good too. Can't complain about anything really, sweet tea was on point and their chicken fingers were off the hook! Toast was perfectly toasted and the center was soft, must try! Definitely coming back here!",2
"Located right next to PNC Park, so is a decent place to get a beer and some grub prior to game day. That and outdoor seating are main perks. Otherwise, food and prices are not worth a stop. This place will fill up on game day, but should be avoided when the Pirates aren't in town. It isn't a BAD experience. If you are siting outside and you have a view of Pittsburgh, it can't be that bad.",1
"I hated this massage. Period. At one point the therapist climbed up on top of me, straddled me from behind, and I felt really uncomfortable. There was also no sheet on the bed and I had only the blanket covering me, I hope it wasn't see through. There was no music except for therapist's heavy breathing. Awful and uncomfortable.",1
"I have to say thank you to Marie and the district manager at Public Storage, they have been so nice and kind to me. The place is very clean and very safe. I have been around to many storage places in Vegas, and this place is the best, I mean they are very trustworthy and they will be honest. What I have been through in Vegas, this place is the best.",2
"One of the slowest ""fast food "" experiences I have seen. The staff couldn't try any harder not to look more uninterested in serving the customers either. The food however is pretty tasty for a burger joint, and the prices are what you would expect from a casino. You can do better, but if a burger and fries are what you crave. This is as good as it gets.",1
"I have been taking my dog to Samy's for the past three years now. He has always done an excellent job of grooming her. She always comes home with cute little bows on her ears and she smells so lovely. He charges so little compared to other grooming services in Las Vegas, but the quality of the service is right on par with the rest. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",2
"I ate at the original location on Sanibel Island in the late 80s. I can't remember what I thought of the place back then. Fast forward to 2014. Ordered two burgers cooked medium. They came out well done and had zero taste. I loved the toppings but for a better burger at a better price, I'll stick with Five Guys. It blows this place away.",1
Very disappointing! We went for Easter lunch and everything was awful. Bad service bad food! Kale salad with salmon was blah salmon was not cooked. Shrimp cocktail had no flavor were not cleaned properly.yuck! Dry French toast served without maple syrup. When the syrup finally came the toast was cold! Eggs Benedict was okay but nothing to rave about. Would not recommend!,1
"There is nothing wrong with this place, but nothing particularly redeeming either. The food was mediocre, and the interior didn't seem to fit the theme. The servers seemed aloof. We were there for the lunch buffet which had an ok selection of the Indian standards. The best part was a never ending basket of your choice of fresh baked Naan.",1
"Ostensibly to revitalize er, vitalize the downtown commerce landscape, the wacky urban park Patriots Square was removed to create this supposed shopping mecca. Looks to me to be yet another in a series of failed, incongruous Phoenix urban development projects that attract the indifferent few to the not interesting. Yawn.",1
"Horrible customer service! The woman I spoke with on the phone was rude, insulting, and very unhelpful! When I asked about doing just one spraying instead of setting up a monthly schedule she said ""UM, we are called pest CONTROL not pest get rid of! "" Sooo rude and uncalled for! I will never do business with such a disrespectful person!",1
"Been here 3 times in 5 months. Each visit is a nightmare. The help is not focused, they do not pay attention to your order. The food is sub standard for sonic, and I will not be back. Last visit was easy, a burger and tots. The tots were forgotten, and the burger was so overdone it was crusty. I would give negative stars if I could.",1
"Great place to have a nice buffet style dinner. Excellent crab legs, they are split in half so they take no effort to eat. Delicious. Great salad bar, great desert options, a lot of options. Atrium like atmosphere, which I found nice, my gf however did not, she thought it was kind of like a food court. Overall a decent place to escape the tables and get full.",2
"Delicious! Their soup is amazing. The broth and the pork is perfect. The add ons complete your soup to your liking. The fried rice is full of flavor and the gyoza which is like a wonton stuffed with ground pork Is yummy too. I'm going to try their pork belly over rice one day. I've seen so many people order that. To top it off, the service is great! Very fast and friendly",2
"Mmmm loved this place for breakfast. nHad the egg white omelet perfectly cooked ala Paris with tasty frittes, roasted savory herbed tomatoes and the most delicious bread. The pain chocolate was just like France, flaky, buttery and oozing chocolatey goodness. Great service.I am so happy I happened upon this place for breakfast. Reasonably priced too for Vegas!",2
"This place is honestly so bad. My self my girlfriend and her mom came in and we ordered three dishes , once we got home and began eating, mine was cold and very distasteful, my girlfriends was burnt, and my girlfriends moms was terrible all around. We called and asked for a refund. They said sorry but no refunds we can only make you another of what you've bought.",1
worst panda express nfood cold all the time nbad service all the time nnever get what you order all the time like i told the manager if your service goes down during lunch hours and other peak times because you are busy then your prices should go down during lunch and other peak hours because you are busy!,1
"This is my first Cheesecake Factory. There's a show that involves moving sculptures right outside that runs at an increment amount of time. Anyways, I just found out this restaurant serves more than just cheesecakes. But, it didn't matter because I just come here to try out their amazing different types of chessecakes.",2
"One of my favorite places to eat at! I don't really care for the ""so called "" spring rolls or the salads that they serve on their menu. I do however have a liking for their thai basil chicken with white rice! Yum. Good service, good food and good price. Beware, it can get really busy and loud during dinner time so good luck trying to hear yourself talk.",2
"Fresh Veggies, YAY! Did my Snow Peas and Broccoli just crunch? Why YES they did. Everything is made to order and piping hot which is always a huge plus for me. Shrimp and Lobster Sauce.EXCELLENT! Not only are they off The Strip they are also open on a Saturday Night after 10 pm. nSN They have a Full Bar with a very capable Bartender.",2
"so, i was gung ho for the level 9 spiciness. nate talked me into the level 8. after the apetizer plate, i was sweating so bad that they sent out a thai iced tea just to help. this was spicy nirvana. the drunken soft shell crab is easy top five of all food experiences. the cherry on top of my las vegas sundae.",2
"The food is amazing and reasonably priced. The drinks are well made. The staff know their whiskey and wine. Even though the it is a specialty bar, ordering top self whiskey is about the same price or cheaper than it is at other off strip bars. Of course it is much cheaper then strip bars. The inside is a great place to sit an talk with friends and the outside is great for people watching.",2
"Really cool. but not much to see for the price of admission. we spent a lot of time watching the dolphins. they are beautiful and so much fun to enjoy. didn't see any of the ""shows "", but that didn't matter. fun to just hang out by their pool. the cats were our other favorite. the lions are amazing to watch. even got to hear some good roars!",2
My kids always have a great time. My littlest son however has gotten a couple of diaper rashes from not being changed regularly or well. He is no longer in the infant toddler room so I hopefully will not have to deal with that anymore. A little pricey but what do you expect from a business in a casino establishment.,2
"This place is great on a regular weekend, but spring break weekends and other types of holidays, XS would be the last place for me to go. I'm just going to be fair as it is and give this place 4 stars because, it's actually quite fun if you're not sharing sweat with strangers in the bar or just walking to your table. Cool environment and you just gotta love the outdoor swimming pools.",2
Food was pretty good but the staff are a bunch of zombies walking around with absolutely no customer service let alone personality. Out bar tender Steven acted as if he was in hell and provided a borderline unpleasant experience do to how non personable he was. Not to pick on Steven but this was a common trend with ALL the staff. Not sure I'll come back again. Try smiling guys!,1
We ate here because it was across the street from St. Joseph's hospital where our baby was in intensive care. Had the Parma Hash. It was amazing! I love the server Tomara! She has an awesome personality. She noticed my hospital bracelet and we told her about our baby and she was sweet enough to say a prayer for him. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. It has a friendly happy environment.,2
"Excellent choice for Dim Sum. Busy place, which keeps the food fresh and the carts moving. Very reasonably priced, as dim sum should be. Flavor and freshness on the bakery stuff was just as good as on the savory fish and vegetable choices I don't eat meat other than seafood . Great way to start a weekend day.",2
"7 6 2013 visit. Bar staff is not friendly. For a brand new casino, only been opened a few days, you would think that maybe the staff could act if they were happy for your business. We asked about any specials and we got a ""nope "" for an answer then a stare. Draft beer almost cold but not quite. Huge lines at the player club with not enough staff.",1
As always outstanding food and service. We've been dining here for over a year now and we have never been disappointed! The food has always been spectacular and the ambiance of the restaurant fabulous. I highly reccomend this restaurant for authentic Italian dining. The owner really takes pride in providing a fabulous dining experience for his guest and it shows. We can't wait to go back!,2
"This is a good place for lunch. Their sandwiches, salads and pizza are really good. Some of my personal favorites is the Black and Bleu salad, the BBQ chicken pizza and the Newks Favorite salad. The only down side is that the prices isn't as friendly as I would like them to be. Other than that. A great lunch spot indeed.",2
This place has some amazing food. The price is pretty high for what you are actually getting. Seems like mainly hipsters go here to hang out so I always take my food to go. The music played in the background by the band is annoying and overpowering. I couldn't even have a conservation with girlfriend when we went out here. To go is the way to go.,1
"Hon Amotive is the best place to take your Japanese import, hands down. It might not be the cheapest, but the parts will always be authentic factory parts, and the work will always be done well. Not much else to say except that if you care about your import, stop taking it to Brake Masters and bring it here instead!",2
some of the best pizza I've eaten. IHadvery good cheese on top was great thank you very much for a great time the only bad thing is I have to fLy home t San Francisco tomorrow but I would like to thank Michelle for being a great hostess she's noT Michelle she's from New Jersey but I had a great time thank you very much,2
"Worst dining experience ever! The runner served our soup with his fingers inside the bowl this is unacceptable at any restaurant. My main dish was cold, by the time I recieved a new one, my boyfriend dish was already cold. The empty plates were sitting stacked on our table forever before the busser took them. Overall worst dining experience that I have ever had not recommended!",1
"I am not by any means a cupcake connoisseur, however Sprinkles has the best cupcakes I have ever tried. Fresh and tasty and the service is always friendly. Sure they run out of flavors I want to try margarita , but the ones I have had are great. I haven't found the best time to come to get the rare flavors.",2
"I loved the food here! The sushi was very fresh. We had the 300, happy ending and another one with veggies that was just wonderful. Also.had the peanut butter mochi for dessert. Never had PB mochi before and it was really really good! I will definitely be back to this place! My only complaint was that the service was a little on the slow side, but other than that it was great!",2
This is a fantastic store! I went here on my last visit in Vegas and had such a great experience in the store. I was helped my Lauren who was so attentive and friendly. I really appreciated her being helpful but not pushy. The store has great variety of merchandise and is totally reasonable with their Sale pricing. I cannot wait to go back!,2
"Friendly staff, close to the gym and my work. All of that meets the criteria for Starbucks, but the coffee is not as good as the local shops around Vegas. The store is small and does not offer much space to lounge when it gets busy. Most of the people that come in look like they are in the midst of a jammed pack day anyways. I tend to have large gaps in my day, so comfort is highly important.",2
"Checked out Joe's for some live music. I have been here quite a few times, but not recently. What a change! Much more room around the stage since the games got moved to the new space. Stage seems bigger, but maybe it's just me. With the loss of Blooze, I am sure I'll be back here more often. Best place in the area for live music and reasonably priced drinks.",2
"I am so blessed to be a patient of Dr Ragaini, She makes her patients feel so comfortable and welcomed in the most uncomfortable of situations. Everyone in the office goes above any beyond to make each visit easy and seamless, as a whole the team is really good at getting patients back on time and addressing appointments in a timely manor. I love this office!",2
"What a joke. Worst service I think I've ever received. I feel bad for the owners of such an awful establishment. We went because reviews on yelp. Awful. Vegetables weren't cooked all the way through. We were one of 3 tables and had to wait 30 minutes for food. We all ate cereal at home it was so bad. Cold, not cooked, no flavor. Shame on Susie.",1
"Mediocre food, I had the chicken shawarma plate with falafel on the side. The chicken was probably the best part, the falafel was not very good I'm kinda picky about my falafel the hummus wasn't good, and it came with soggy fries. Also, I ordered it to go and when I got home they had forgotten my pita bread. There's better Mediterranean food in town, I won't be returning here.",1
"Came here on the last day before heading off to the airport. Man, wish I came here on the first day. I had their filet mignon and eggs sliders, excellent. We also had the eggs benedict and was not disappointed. The only thing is it was kinda pricey here. The two of us spent 50 for breakfast. But I guess that's everywhere in vegas. What a nice way to end the trip!",2
I been taking my cocker spaniel to see doctor brooks for the past 3 1 2 years Cosmo loves it here he is alway so happy when I bring him for yearly shots b for his dental cleaning and he just gap a growth removed on his lip he was still happy I love town center animal hospital they are the best out here in Vegas Dr. Brooks is the best,2
"Love the firecracker chicken wraps as an appetizer, wish there were a few more of those things! I ordered the parm, crusted chicken dish and it was wonderful. service is very friendly and they really aim to please! I liked them on facebook and used the free app coupon and would come back for more coupons. thanks!",2
After planning my day around the Friday 2 05 Turbo Tournament I registered and waited for over an hour only to hear them announce that they were canceling the tournament FIVE MINUTES before it was scheduled to start. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. They have also downsized the room and it is very cramped now. Big disappointment.,1
"After waiting 30 minutes for a table and being told they accommodate food allergies we tried to order a burger with lettuce rather than a bun, they told us they don't do any substitutions and it would be an extra 6 dollars for a side of lettuce. We left and went to I heart burger who substituted a side salad for the bread free of charge",1
HORRIBLE. Bought new wheels from Discount Tire and two days later my tire and fell off going 70mph on I17! Bill the store manager didn't do anything. Never called me back! They messed up three times in my transaction and now the tire fell off and cost me over 300! They will not reimburse any of the damages and refuse to even talk to me!,1
"i should have trusted my instinct HOW CAN YOU TRUST AN ASIAN COOKING MEXICAN FOOD OR VICE VERSA? but let me give you a piece of advise. FOR you TO know if its a good sushi asian restaurant you HAVE see abunch of asian in that place. the food sushi and miso soup was cold. service sucks, the waitress were unprofessional .the food was expensive and the food sucks.",1
"I have been here twice and been impressed with their food both times. I can't recall the name but we ordered a meat lovers pizza on both occasions along with a salad to share. The portions are very generous and the food is great, I would definitely go back again and I have recommended to many already.",2
"Torn between 5 and 4 stars, but ended on 4 since I feel there are discernibly better places in MTL to dine and wine. Always packed, this place is good for culture,and the personnel prepared to assist in food and drink selection. If in MTL, make this a priority to visit. I simply cannot give it 5 stars because other places nearby merit that accolade only slightly more.",2
"This is an old time plastic menu breakfast place by my parents house. Looks like ypour typical IHOP. Trusted by fellow yelpers on this one. The pancakes were the star. Made from scratch and very good. Portion size for a short stack could feed two, no problem. nHadn't had this type of food in a long time. Kept me full and satisfied all day.",2
"I ventured over here to kill some time, but the slots were really boring and I didn't win anything. Generally I'll win a few bucks, but here, the slots were really old. you can tell they taped some of the missing bits together with Scotch tape. So lame. The machines also don't spin properly. However, you'll find the cheapie slots from 1 cent up which could be cool for some.",1
"I had wait 20 minutes at the bar Just for someone to take my order. then I had to wait about 45 minutes for my order of deep fried pickels. Since I was sitting at the bar I could see the kitchen and the cooks spent most of there time standing around talking for a half hour with out doing a damn thing,",1
"Some slow service at this place. My date And I were there about an hour before the food came out. Wings were OK, though. I don't understand how a national chain could be so dirty. The table had sticky junk on the bottom edges. The carpet and tile floors in the restaurant were stained. Finally, the men's room had cobwebs in the corners and everything that could be dusty was.",1
After waiting 2 1 2 hrs for a delivery I called to find out the status of my delivery. I was told they ran out of beefeater rolls that is why I had not recieved my order? Why wasnt I contacted I asked I was told because she was too busy. Pretty sad all of the other locations are fantastic! Maybe its poor management.,1
"The restaurant is fairly large, but we were the only diners at lunch time. We shared 2 each of the pastor and borrego lamb street tacos plus a diet cola. The tacos were made with only one tortilla that wasn't very soft and the runny salsa added little in the way of flavor. Overall, we thought the tacos to be a little below average.",1
"The Mirage. I will not be returning to you!. I stayed at the hotel with my fiance in late January and hated every moment. I seriously felt that I was in a funeral parlor at times. The rooms were yuck. a nasty cordouroy pillow, awful view and the smallest bathroom in the world!. I would have rather stayed at Motel 8! The only highlight of my trip was going to CPK at the hotel! NEVER EVER AGAIN",1
"We really liked it at lunch before we flew off to Vegas. My wife loved the filet steak special for lunch and my steak salad was great as well. The coconut pie we split was ridiculous in great taste and size. I'm surprised by the poor reviews and if the girls working there don't mind what they're wearing, not that risque really why should you?",2
"Just an average restaurant. With the exception of the baked spaghetti, which is fabulous, the food is not very good. Pizza is tasteless because the dough is unsalted. Salads are watery and mostly iceberg lettuce. Decor is plain. Looks like the interior of a diner more than that of an Italian restaurant. Service is good, although nothing special.",1
"It's good! The cha siu BBQ pork is one of the better ones I've had in the States. The pieces are smaller and more tender. The downside is the sauce is more like traditional soy sauce rather than the thicker cha siu sauce that other places have. and you don't get enough sauce on the rice. Not as good as HK or Vancouver, but better than many of the places in LA. Definitely would come back!",2
"Not that great Mexican restaurant.in an airport. The server was really friendly though. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos, the fish was overly fishy smelling, and it was not served with all the stuff the menu said, no mango salsa, no fresh tomatoes, no cilantro.the best thing was the guacamole I ordered on the side.",1
"Ate the 12.95 lunch time buffet on a Monday and it was very disappointing. The food was oily and seemed to be sitting out for a long time. Oddly, the place seemed busy, which made me think one of two things a Being the only Indian restaurant on The Strip, Tamba's owners clearly aren't worried about quality b Tamba's dinner menu must be amazing to compensate.",1
Amazing! The best show I have ever seen. My boyfriend and I have now committed to seeing any and every cirque show that we can. They incorporate an entire water show into this one and the entire thing leaves you speechless. It was incredible. The sets are breathtaking and the performers are unbelievable. Definitely a must see!,2
"Rather surprised last night to be greeted here, at least an hour before last orders, by the barmaid expressing dismay at 3 more customers turning up. She already had in the region of ten on the premises but seemed keen to close up early and get a kip. Happy for the foreseeable future to enable her to do so by drinking elsewhere.",1
"Linda v is my favorite here and she belongs a personal room other than main part of salon, hence I need not to get my toes done in main salon. She also a classic guy loves all the best classic song it crests more nice environment in here room, so I like it much. Ergonomic chair she uses is the best one fees so comfort. I just suggest you to come here specially to Linda nice woman does greats!",2
"Overpriced junk. Nothing says fashion trendsetters like 4 pencils and 10 decks of playing cards. I actually bought one of the 6 Kris Jenner masks just a cardboard pic glued to a stick as a gag gift. Kinda embarrassed about it, but it has made for great fun at the bars. 40 for a coffee mug. For that I should also get a walk on role to one of the TV shows. I can play dramatic. Only in America!",1
"Love the new hospital. Very ample and accommodating. The volunteers are awesome. Always ready to help. We're pleased with service and level of professionalism. Waiting for appointments does take 2 3 months, OT PT ST are so overbooked. Wish there was another facility closer to our home. Overall we are satisfied. But, there is room for improvement",2
"Wow, the berry pancakes with banana and grain are so good. I'll definitely be back. I can see where the waiting staff might have some timing issues. There seemed to be an overly relaxed vibe amongst the staff which left me scratching my head. But the food more then made up for it and they did pay attention to detail.",2
"Ordered a chx parm sandwich for lunch. I should have known when it was dead at noon. Two bites and in the bin. Sloppy gross red sauce. Old and overlooked chicken. On a burnt hamburger bun store bought for just under 7. What a waste of money on some horrible food. I should have gone with my gut which said gt pizza, now I'll never know because I'll never return.",1
"I am not a dance club person at all. Seriously, unless forced or obligated for a bachelorette party, I don't do clubs. Six is a great alternative to the club scene. Cool lounge atmosphere with great music and good drinks. The down side is all the people doing ecstasy, drinking water. I prefer the drunks to the druggies. However, it is a cool place to mingle in Scottsdale.",2
"My husband and I love Indian food and was very excited to find a place close to where we live. What a disappointment! The naan bread was actually pita bread, it looks store bought. The vegetable biryani was not fresh and steamed in an aluminum foil packet it was not at all what we expected. We've experienced the wonderful, true, fresh Indian food and this is definitely not it.",1
"Horrible experience! nWe were looking forward to this dinner date. Ate there before steak and lobster dinner special, but this time was awful. Steak was almost raw, and the service was good, but we were not offered a replacement, or a credit, even after the manager got involved. nNever ever going back, and definitely would not recommend the place after this.",1
This is one of the most overrated things I have done in a while. I will give it two stars because the dessert was good but for what you pay the food is really lacking. The cost is really high and you cook your own plate! If the cost was about in half it would have gotten three or four stars. On top of that it seemed we were always waiting for the raw foods to show up.,1
"Very disappointed with The Beat! We confirmed one of our NY based bands in this venue to perform acoustically, with a string of correspondence reflecting confirmation, only to have them cancel day of show with zero explanation or apology. Very uncool! nSo, as you sit there sipping your morning mocha, just know how they are treating musicians.",1
"Typical Wet Willies. Really frozen, overly sweet drinks. It was really hard to finish them. However, the bartenders were good and the live music was good. I happened to be here killing some time while it rained during the OAR SOJA show at the amphitheater. I'll go back if I'm in the mood for a frozen concoction. Oh the tequila finger shots were the best!",1
"Someburro's kicks ass. It's a nice middle ground between the standard Berto's and the more sit down experience. Pollo Fundido and Borracho Burritos are awesome. Service is quick. Beaners are bean y. There's nothing spectacular about this place, just really good, solid food served hot and quick. Dig it.",2
"Just. Simply. Discusting. The worst fish and chips I every had. I only went cause it was my wife's spot when she was a kid but never again will I step foot near this place again. The fries, onion rings, fish where just gross. Over fried and no taste. Only decent thing would be the shrimp and sauce thag they have. Oh and remember your own rag to clean your own table and bring your owapkins too.",1
This is one of those bars that I dread going to when I get a text from my friends that they're drinking there. This is exactly the kind of Irish pubs I hate. They're all over the world and the walls are filled with mail order pub decor and none of the staff are Irish. I suspect the owners as well The place also has no soul and over priced.,1
"Breads and croissants are really good here. My favorite was the almond croissant buttery, flaky, and rich with a hint of almond paste perfect for breakfast with their coffee and or tea. The cakes and small pastries were the typical French fare, nothing special. Service was quick and efficient. It gets crowded here during breakfast, but worth it for the croissants.",2
"The portions are huge, and for a great price. I got the Meat Lovers Omelet, and it was purely delightful. The Home Fries were great, and is the perfect side for whatever entree you choose. I'm a visitor from CA, and this has to be one of the best breakfast places I have ever eaten at. If you are traveling, you should consider coming to Ronnie's for breakfast. You will not be disappointed.",2
"The sushi is good. I looove the atmosphere. It is young and fun. Yes, there is amigos. but a wise man would know that sushi is not about that, but the dedication and love of the food. I eat here once a week. I do have to agree though that the appetizers or desserts are not included. But its good and they treat you well.",2
"Extremely slow service at 715 a.m. on a Saturday after Christmas? 15 20 minutes after ordering the food came to us. 2 breakfasts off eggs, bacon and waffles with one coffee and one OJ cost us 27 dollars and change. I left 30 dollars total only because I wanted to leave and didn't have exact change for my bill, otherwise I wouldn't of tipped.",1
"HORRIBLE! Awful service, burned food, dirty restaurant and cooks, ants on the tables, limited seating, the list could go on and on. The ""Meal Deal "" includes fries and a drink which is a can of Safeway brand soda. STAY AWAY! I will never go back to this place. If you want to overpay for food from a what looks like a dirty crack house, this is your place!",1
"Delicious steaks and crab cakes. Excellent waitstaff. Surprisingly good beer selection. I also really like the decor. With all of the caricatures. Personally I try to stay away from the steakhouse chains, but the palm is topnotch. If you're a fan of steaks it doesn't really get batter than the palm. A ",2
"Had to try a classic cheesesteak sandwich since it got such great reviews on Yelp. It was tasteless without ketchup and hot sauce and even after adding those, it didn't taste very good. Also, the fries were cold bleh! I don't get what the hype is about. Yes it's cheap and filling, but it's also bland.",1
Avoooooooid this! Crazy long wait! Waited for an hour and still waiting! I came Tuesday night at 11pm and now it's Wednesday! I used to have good experience with dollar in Connecticut but not this store. should have checked the reviews before choosing this place. There are over five other rental companies you can chose from and non of them have 30 ppl waiting in line like this place!,1
Awesome new spot. Another place that makes me wish I lived closer to downtown. Very hip and urban feel with cool decor and I believe the best dressed people in downtown Vegas. The rooftop patio is pretty sweet and a nice getaway from the action downstairs. A bit on the pricey side. paid 15 for two beers on tap. nGo check this place out! Great addition to the Downtown bar scene.,2
I like Serranos but sometimes their food seems a little too pre made for my tastes. They have good salsa and bean dip and a good selection on the menu. Their veggie enchiladas are good as well as the spinach enchiladas. I like that they have fresh homemade tortillas. They aren't the best tortillas I've had but kudos that they don't use the waxy pre packaged junk that a lot of places use.,2
"Went there with some friends for dinner, was iffy at 1st but the place actually turned out to be very good, the servers were very nice and didn't hesitate to help with our little requests, the food was good and prepared very well. I highly recommend this place! But don't forget to bring cash for the servers they don't take tip over cards for some reason",2
"I Am So Disappointed with this place, I ordered the Vanilla Custard and Wild Cherries. And I Got to Say is Ehhhhh the Cherries were a funky flavor and the Custard was runny it didnt stay together, it separated, I will Not Come Back here. For my First Time Visiting that Place it Will be the Last. Uggghhh",1
"Live feed is unreliable. Just got a hundred pack of worms with 30 still alive. As with any fresh goods, stock should be rotated and or clearanced, not sold dead rotten. I am a fairly new reptile owner, this has been a recurring and frustrating theme. I rarely if ever get pupating dying mealworms from other suppliers. Animals up for sale often seem to need water.",1
"Want cupcakes? Skip this and just go to the smith's. 3.00 per cupcake, 0.00 for the rude attitude on the side. I had the red velvet, I wasn't impressed. My husband had the chocolate. Both where dry, overly sweet icing and the tops were really hard. n nReturn factor nah, I can get delish red velvet cakes at smiths and earn some smiths points.",1
"This was one of my favorite Chinese places in C U, and it's just a tiny place with a few tables. Not expensive at all. I think there was a Chinese grandmother in the kitchen, lovingly preparing meals to be served, but even if not that's how I felt after eating here. Good lo mein, and more recently they've added Thai entrees. Most dishes are vegetarian.",2
"The place is legit. I had chicken and falafel. The falafel was a little dry but everything else was very, very good. Good rice. Very good hummus. Someone wrote it was like Mediterranean Chipotle. It kind of is. You build your own bowl or plate. It is unique and really good. The people helping are also fantastic. I will go back when in town. Thanks Yelp community for this find.",2
"I'm rating this place as the title states.Mix Lounge. I didn't even know they served food here until I started reading some of the reviews. n Well, I liked this place because it was an older crowd.ha ha. It's a nice change of pace from the early 20's crowd. The view was nice. The bartenders were pretty attentive and the drinks were okay.",2
Never seen a bar especially a hotel bar so anxious to close checks and have patrons go away. Happened to me both at lunch and dinner I watched same happen all around me. Too bad because beer selection was good and atmosphere was inviting. Would have otherwise enjoyed spending more time and money here.,1
"I love this nail salon compare to some other ones that I have been to. This salon stole me from Aloha Nails and never will I go back! I get great service at My Bella Spa and my nails always look professionally done, they do get busy so if you don't have much time just schedule an appointment but they welcome walk ins just be prepared to wait sometimes, but its all definitely worth it!",2
"the first time i ate here, the portion was super small. but i gave it another try. glad to say i was not disappointed this time around. korean chicken is pretty good. you can create your own combo, which is always a plus. saimin is a definite throwback to back home. everything here tastes good. one of my favorite local grinds.",2
"This review is based off the food alone, we ate outside and never entered the building. We ordered the Pulled Pork Nachos and the Enchilada Nachos. Both were amazing, and for the price you can't beat it. I also had the Mango Thai Basil Margarita. Holy crap that was delicious. nI will definitely be coming back for more.",2
"Subpar Auto center. Double check details of purchase of tires and service quotes! Purchased 4 new tires with extended warranty. 2 months later, 3 tires developed leaks. Was informed ""this type of leak is not covered by our warranty. "" Quoted 195 for repairs showed up to pay and was charged 232.80. Just watch the details here and make sure you understand what you are getting paying!",1
"The coffee came immediately, before we could look at the menu. Normally, this is a good thing, but their menu was limited and overpriced. The owner and her sister argued loudly and shrill about money with some unintelligible regular who had an recently snubbed cigar hanging in his mouth. We did not want to sit in this run down diner let alone eat there. We paid for the coffee and walked out.",1
"Some of the people that rated this store don't have any idea of what Polish food is.Granted the store is quite small and limited as to inventory but the shelves are NOT empty,in fact quite full.The owners who work there are very helpful and polite.The selection of meats and sausages is always fresh the best blood sausage and ham in town.As to the AC it has been fixed and very nice place to shop.",2
"The Tikka Masala and Makhani are kind of runny compared to Tandoori Times, nnot as thick, nbut the owner is kind, good customer service. nMy fav is the mango lasse. Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Makhani are my favs. I always call in my orders beforehand. nConvinient to go place. But always remember to check our food before you take it home!",2
"This place never ceases to amaze me. In a day and age of warehouse stores, I assumed their prices would be higher. After I bought my first set of tires there I will never buy them anywhere else. And here's the kicker their customer service is ALWAYS the best very courteous and its not just the guys in the lobby. One of the few companies that really gets it.",2
"Fin was great! Yes, it's expensive for Chinese food but yes we are in Vegas and yes on the strip inside a huge resort so it comes with the territory! I thought the service was impeccable the d u00e9cor was very modern and classy. The food was delicious, way better than PF Changs, and beautifully presented, total upscale tasting Chinese food. Absolutely recommend it!",2
"Line was soooooo long. Whoever was taking orders was sooooo slow. I stood in line for 15 minutes, moved about one inch and left. The food is good if you can take advantage of one of their combo nights Monday Saturday . Sunday is kids eat free but who wants eat somewhere with a bunch of noisy kids running around?",1
"I LOVE FunuGyz! It's one of my favorite bars in the area! Food is great, and they play awesome music! During the week, they usually have classic rock going, which makes my heart super happy. As far as the food goes, it's fairly decent for ""bar food "". I love that they mail 1 cent coupons for beer! Keep 'em comin!",2
"If you appreciate an international flare and know what a good croissant is. this is your place. Great coffee, selection of pelligrino, yummy pastries. Very cute place. The only changes I would make is serve salads and change up the seating so its not so formal, strip mall like. Other than that, the best baked goods any CLT bakery has to offer.",2
"Very disappointed. Had acrylic nails applied, tech rushed thru the job. 6 days later looks like I need a fill already and nails don't go completely to the edge on the sides.y daughter had her nails done at the same time, tech argued with her about what she wanted and she wound up with bubbles under 4 if her nails. We WONT be going back. P.s. They speak English, but only if they have to.",1
"If Chinese buffet is what you desire, just keep driving northwest on Grand to the other place! The food is low quality and the place is one of the dirtiest I've seen in the Valley! They do have a friendly staff and a vast selection, and so I can award them one star. Overall this is as bad as it gets, and would have to be starving to walk away satisfied eating here.",1
"I remember going here as a child and thinking that it was one of the greatest places in the world. I appreciate deep fried food, but they take deep fried to a new level. For my taste, the food was too greasy fried. However, the restaurant is very cute and cozy. The salad bar is great and you can expect to be treated with southern hospitality.",1
"After reading previous reviews I gave it a try, NEVER AGAIN! After watching the cook sneeze in his hand then proceed to continue cooking without washing his hands I knew it was time to leave! This place has the potential to be a really neat place, too bad the cook didn't follow basic sanitary common sense!",1
"What can I say, The Keg never disappoints. Their food is delish and their drinks are even better. They made me an amazing strawberry martini that I still think about weeks later. Sadly it was a ""seasonal "" drink so I won't be able to get it again until next spring summer. Their service is also always exceptional. This is one of my fave spots, I just wish it was a little easier on the wallet.",2
"I used Accent for my wedding, they provided a 33 passenger bus shuttle service to from my wedding. They were very reasonably priced, close to 200 cheaper than the nearest quote. The driver arrived on time, and was very pleasant. They did get lost on one of the return trips, but wasn't a big deal. Would use them again.",2
"Took my bike for work on the front derailleur grips replacement. I didn't do a test ride until I brought it home, now the REAR derailleur downshift lever is hard to depress, the new grips were installed with the brand names, which should point forward, both pointing wrong very different from each other. Amateurish work! O",1
"Took my 16yr old daughter here to shoot for her 1st time. She did ""The Little Giants "" package. Our range guide was Doug and he was awesome! After shooting all the .22 cal weapons Doug broke out the an M4 to finish. Battlefield Vegas was super professional and knowledgeable. You have a choice in Vegas.choose Battlefield Vegas.",2
the only bad thing about this place is that it is cash only. which is sometimes a little inconvenient but other then that its probably one of the most reasonably priced places in chinatown. its way less then tea station about half the price. so for now this is my new favorite place. nothing i have tried is bad here.,2
"We have a new favorite! Freddie's Steakburger and Custard is hands down the best hamburger to hit Surprise az yet! We have one suggestion, the oil needs to be kept hot for the fries otherwise they get to greasy! That's why I give them 4 stars as about half the time we eat their the fries are good and the other times they are soaked in greased, which means that the temp of the oil isn't hot enough.",2
"Service is superfast, however the servers look like they don't wanna be there nnow to the quality of the pho, I've had 21 which is vegeterian pho , it was super LOUSY nI ate here several times and this is the worst I've had however once it was delicious so it can be hit or miss . With so many pho places in town i'll steer away from this place for a while .",1
"La flor de Calabaza es un lugar como ningun otro en Phoenix. Musica en vivo, bebidas y deliciosos aperitivos. Excelente servicio, la chica que nos atendio nos ofrecio muy buenas sugerencias en cuanto a bebidas y los aperitivos. la musica es Rock en espanol. Es un lugar donde te puedes divertir y estar en un ambiente tan padre entre amigos. Definitivamente regreseramos.",2
"It seems like when we come here looking for things, they just don't have what we want. Too bad the company is a shell of its former self. It is an OK place when you want staples at a good price, but this is way out of my area and we only stop here when we think they might have something we need. When will I learn?",1
"Who doesn't love a good massage? I love this place, my husband and I have a membership and we only pay 80 a month, we both get a choice of an hour relaxation massage or facial. It is such a nice treat and indulgence each month. They can always get us in at the same time and usually even on the same day we want an appointment. The owner is so nice and everyone I've gone to is very good.",2
"This days inn is very nice. Google mislead us and it was a little farther than we thought it was from the highway, but we found it eventually. Note that the advertised parking amenities are for you to pay 12 per night to park in a sketchy lot across the street not cool. But the rooms are very nice and clean, and the staff were very friendly even though we did not speak french.",2
"This place is a dump. The equipment is old and crummy. The team members constantly bug you to buy their products they never approached me but I've seen them do this to other ppl and they always profile the overweight . The only reason I would come here is because this is the only gym closet to my area, and it's still pretty far.",1
Horrible equipment. ! nHorrible experience ! After moving out of state. They really make it tough to cancel a membership. I've been trying to get this done for 4 months now ! nThey will make you send a Certified letter to cancel and charge 30 plus Dollars to cancel . Spend the extra money and go 24 Hour of LA fitness !,1
"Great place to go on the days and evenings where it is an organized school event. This business does support our local schools with skating parties. Yet I went one open afternoon and the parents were crude and rude and their kids were cursing up a storm too. We could not wait to leave. The facility itself is nice inside, but the crowd can really color the environment.",1
"Excellent restauraunt! Paymon's is absolutely the best Mediterranean restaurant in Las Vegas, from the delicious food to the beautiful ambiance inside the restaurant and hookah lounge. Everything is well prepared and tastes fresh, the Gyro Salad here is to die for, simply perfection. This is definitely a must try in Vegas!",2
"To all coffee lovers, this is a place to visit! If you think you know how great coffee should taste well, visit Artisan Roast first, and then review your thoughts on a coffee. The atmosphere, music, deco takes you into a different world. The staff could smile more but it is and will be by all means the best coffee shop ever.",2
"This is like the after hours hotspot on the strip unless you want strip clubs? . I seem to always end up at this place, cracked out from all that redbull and go0se at 5 a.m. and still drinking more. lolz. Its a really nice place to go too, seems more laid back here compared to the club because its just people mingling and dancing.",2
"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I have used many mobile pet grooming companies but this one is, by far, the BEST! My dog Mocha is a golden chow mix and they did the best lion cut groom on her. She loved them! They were on time and each groomer was very nice and professional. You can tell they love what they do! Don't waste your time shopping around since this company is the best!",2
I started off with the ribs wich where really good. A nice asian sauce and the ribs where cooked perfect. I had the shrimp etoufee wich was amazing it was a little spicy but perfect. It had some homemade anduile sausage that was delish. I finsihed with the banana cream pie wich was the size of a basketball ! It was very good with lots of fresh bannas and cream.,2
"Even though the bartenders and our waitress were super friendly, the service was really slow, and it seemed like there were just Vegas locals here. WHOA! Everyone knew each other and I felt out of place. That's what I get for visiting my Vegas friends! Oh.the food? It was OK. I ordered Buffalo Wings. I think Domino's is better.",1
I LOVE FOGO! nMy family and I went on Thanksgiving while visiting Vegas. This was the best thanksgiving meal I ever had. I am not a huge red meat fan but their meat was delicious. The salad bar was excellent also. The staff was friendly and always made sure we were well taken car of. I plan to go to the LA locatioext time I am craving red meat.,2
"This was an ok Fry's store but much sketchier than others I have been too granted we were there at night. I would recommend going to another one if possible. There was a guy standing out front without a shirt just hanging out, lots of people standing around in the parking lot, and a security guard in the store.",1
"Reading some reviews about Sprinkles, I agree with two points n the frosting is too sweet and too much for a cupcake n the cost for each cupcake is too high So as a place to buy cupcakes is definitely not one of the best, there are other cheaper places with more natural and less sweet flavor. I love cupcakes and so far the only one I enjoyed was the Red Velvet. Other cupcakes were just ""ok "".",1
My six year old persian got into my mum plant and had stomach poisoning. Dr. Bart gave him fluids under the skin an oral prescription antibiotic and a bland diet and after two days he was good as new and happy. A few days later she gave us a call to make sure that he was okay Dr. Bart really goes above and beyond and has always been a fantastic vet.,2
Music is great! Service a bit lacking Items don't match what's written in the menu. Daughter ordered popcorn shrimp but they served 3 big butterflied shrimp instead nI ordered meat ravioli but got some pesto mish mosh instead Decent but not traditional meat ravioli. nWould come back just to have dinner on the patio with live music,1
"I very rarely find anything here that I like. I respect the local business built from the ground up.just not what I am ever looking for in clothing. Also, the employees can be pretty rude and dismissive, even as they demand that you stand there while they look through your stuff. I prefer to do other things with my time.",1
"I like Red Robin. It's a chain. I know. It's industrial food. I know. But it's my gold standard for burgers. My first experience with Red Robin was the original Anchorage location at the Northway Mall. A beacon of light, warmth and burgers in the great white north. Now sadly closed, as well I understand, the original locatioear U Dub no, not Wyoming .",2
"I have eaten at several chinese buffets all around town. I decided on this one based on other reviews here. I found the food to be OK not anything really spectacular. The sushi did not taste fresh, and the rice was a little old. I was surprised by this considering we went there for dinner on a Friday night. I probably won't be eating there again.",1
"i had to get rid of some extra energy, so, i walked in and found myself in their aerobic space, and zumba'd me tired! It was fun and exciting, I got to express myself and let everyone know I was born this way. Sweaty and tired after my hour long session, I said my goodbyes and left, went home, showered and slumbered.",2
"They have reallllllly hot miso soup! I know that because the last time I was here, our waitress poured half of my miso in my lap. With no apology. And no offers to comp the soup that probably has left my ovaries unable to function. But hey, she and the other staff are pretty so that's all that matters, right? Nobody cares about service or basic manners anymore, right?",1
We were looking for sushi that isn't Ra or Blue Wasabi. Someplace that isn't the bar scene and has good sushi. We have been here 2 times now and have been very happy with the sushi. It isn't fancy or flashy but takes care of our craving for sushi. Very mom and pop feel and the employees are all very nice. Highly recommend for a stop for some sushi.,2
"I'm only giving two stars because they do not have one single thing on the menu that is gluten free. With a gluten free diet being so popular now days, I would think they would have at least a few items to offer. Otherwise it seems clean and comfortable. We ordered two ice teas. They seemed watered down and sort of bitter. I think the water that makes the ice must be pretty gross.",1
"Thanksgiving Dinner was very disappointing! We watched two ""couples "" sit down, order, eat and leave, in the time we ordered and got our food. We all had the turkey, but yet, they told us, the had to cook more. We waited an extra half hour for our food, our total was over 75, and they gave us a ""sorry card "" for 10 off our NEXT meal. Thanks, that doesn't help our wait and full priced meal!",1
"Horrible service! Do not come here ever. One time I came to the store 15 mins before their closing time and they didn't let me in. Another day I came 40 mins before they closed and they were rushing me to the cashier the whole time. Super rude! Also, one day I asked for the price of an item and she said ""I don't know "" and walked away.",1
"Tons of FUN! nGrrreat people watching, entertaining visuals at every turn, cutting edge products, and lots of adult stars to ogle and stand in long lines for their autographs, if you are so inclined. The 2012 event will be held at the Hard Rock . Jan 18 21. Check it out for yourself and make some unforgettable memories! Brown chicken Brown cow . LOL",2
"Only place to get Traditional sushi in Vegas. Don't go if you are looking for rolls or fancy sauces. This place does traditional fish, rice, seaweed in amazing perfectionism. I've never had to make a reservation, but if you want to make sure you can get in to the small place it is probably a good idea. especially during a friday saturday.",2
"At first this place looked like another noodle chain. But, I was impressed! It reminded me of crepevine in California but for noodles! Did that even make sense? I liked their trio combo for 7 bucks soup salad and pasta with meat ! I had the pesto, but I'm definitely going back to try more things on their menu. They also have passionfruit iced tea that's rumored to be awesome.",2
"I was excited to try their food and not eat another 'chain' meal. The counter girl could not get my order right, charged me the wrong thing, and then when I asked about their gift for being a Veteran they said I needed to show them proof. I have never felt so terrible about sharing the fact that I served in Iraq. It's sad that someone would question my service to my country.",1
"Incredibly rude. Waited at the drive thru speaker for two whole minutes with no greeting and when I said hello? The woman replied in a snotty tone, ""we will be right with you "" I used to work at Jack and I know that one of the noegotiables to greet within the first 5 seconds. I don't understand why she couldn't greet me and tell me to hold on for a second. Never returning here because of her.",1
"After reading the reviews on yelp and then eating there I am losing my faith in the collective wisdom of yelp. nFirst the chips and salsa very bland and watered down salsa. Next the chille relleno tasteless. I have had better tasting Mexican food in Berlin, Germany. nService was friendly and a good Margarita. Inecpensive as well.",1
"Not a big fan of eating indian food while travelling as i get enough of it in bay area, but this being a common popular place in the middle of the strip i thought i will give it a try. The knowledgeable people I asked eho have good indian food reviewing skills all told me this place is extraordinarily ordinary. Its USP is it's location. They were all right !",1
"Stayed in Encore and played on Aug 16 with friend. Course's fairway is in extremely bad shape, probably worst than most of of munis. The course should NOT be opened for play at all, specially with high expectation anticipated from Steve Wynn's standard. Walk off the course with SHOULD NOT RETURN mental note. Although the caddie service is excellent, probably the only positive from the experience.",1
"I ordered their new Avocado Burrito with a small soda, they corrected me ""you mean the number nine "" a chicken avocado burrito . Um ok, they'd know their menu better right? WRONG. The chicken avocado burrito is DOUBLE in calories and fat I couldn't even finish eating it, it was so gross . Be careful when ordering, you may end up with more than you bargain for.",1
"Wasn't the best. Coming from Hawaii.they so do not know how to do shave ice right! No taste.I mean yay they have ice cream at the bottom, but nothing like OMG wow amazing! The ice shaving was too fine and kinda felt creamy. And it was too dense. But their spoons were soooo cool! It was blue then when you get it cold it turned purple. Saving those!",1
"The staff behaved very bad.if you ask them for ""liquor menu "" their reply is an arrogant ""No "" because you asked for a wrong menu.it's called the ""Beer Menu "" not liquor.lol Food is average, not something exciting. All my rating is for the samosa and the Indian bread, which was always served hot! Very good service, even when it was crowded. Overall a decent 2 star",1
"Came here with some friends and family member to try out this new place. Service was extremely horrible. Menu was only brought to us after sitting at the table for 10 minutes and we had to ask for it. Our drinks was not even refill once and server did not even bother to check on us. Food was alright, nothing special. I wouldn't come here again.",1
"I don't really like to talk shit about restaurants but this place was absolutely horrible. For 5 extra you can go to a place like sushi mon and have freshly made all u can eat sushi and side dishes. I paid for my girlfriend and I , but we couldn't eat any of the sushi because of how horrible it was.",1
"Grabbing a quick lunch before driving back to the IE. Chicken jambalaya was tasty, and justices enough. The lunch size portion fills you up but not so much that you fall asleep driving home. Service was good as usual but had to remind the waiter about bread. Warning, the flavored lattes are really sweet. Stick with a straight latte, espresso, or coffee. 4 out of 5 because of the flavored lattes.",2
"My wife loves the peach cobbler milkshake and so when we were in this part of town and hungry, we hit their drive through. Not much of a wait at 3 00 PM, so we were immediately able to place our order there are two lines, folks! and pull around. The shake was deemed excellent with enough peach and cobbler in it to pass inspection.",2
"I don't recommend this place. The front desk people were not very nice. My room was not ready and after finally having it ready at 530, after arriving at 1230, the room was dark, gloomy, smelly and overall very disappointing. I'll never stay here again. The walls are thin and you can hear it when people are walking above you. Don't buy into this timeshare!",1
Claim to be the Best steak in Las Vegas years in a row. I would rate their steak with IHOP or Denny's. Poor quality meat. Tasted tough definitely needed a sharp steak knife. I think the only thing to get there is breakfast and even then it doesn't seem like anything special. The decour was interesting and retro.,1
"My business is a part of the Scottsdale Chamber of Commerce and I attended a Chamber meeting this morning that Xona hosted. Everything was great the poolside views, the excellent breakfast, and the service was friendly and timely. I did not stay there but recommend checking out the resort. I really had a great experience.",2
"A hundred dollar co pay for mediocre medical care and a 6 hour wait in the ER for stitches?! Yeah, no. The quality of care here is subpar and they DEMAND payment before they will let you leave, even if you have no ability to pay. Doctors were not informative and missed a fracture in my ankle because they didn't request x rays. Won't be back",1
Beautiful view AWFUL cocktails. Came here for after dinner drinks after an amazing dinner at Twist. Ordered a Cosmo. Had to send it back it was SOO bad. Nice waitress quickly offered to get it re made. Second attempt was only slightly better. Worst drinks I can remember ever having. No excuse for what they charge. We will NOT be back. Come for the view and then RUN!,1
"Have ordered several times from Aloha Hawaiian BBQ and have ordered the following items Hawaiian BBQ chicken, spam masubi, chicken katsu, Hawaiian burger, garlic shrimp and seafood combo. The food is excellent however, inconsistent. 80 of the time the food is amazing but you have to risk the 20 when the food is so, so. The price makes it well worth trying out.",2
"My friend and I went out to eat for a quick bite to eat we both had nachos I ordered mine with chicken and she ordered it with steak. Despite the large portion size, the nacho chips were dry and therefore texture wise felt stale. The cheese dried out and wasn't melted in addition Both of our meats were dry. I would prefer to go to Emiliano's next time and get better nachos there.",1
"Jamie is a very talented photographer and we were so fortunate to have her photograph our wedding. She is extremely professional, flexible, creative, responsive, and very kind. She perfectly captured the essence of our day through wonderful candid shots and artistic, well posed formals. I couldn't recommend her more highly.",2
"The furniture here is beautiful but customer relations was rather poor. We went to return a piece of furniture after we decided we didn't like it with the rest of the decor, and they told us there was no returns. Period. I've never heard of someplace not doing returns. Based off that experience alone, I'll be finding somewhere else to buy furniture in the future.",1
"This property offers so much given their rates. There are many restaurants, and the rooms are well appointed. Even though it is not in the center of the strip, the walk even as far as Caesars Palace or The Venetian doesn't seem too bad, and this hotel has a monorail stop too. I've stayed here many times, and find it better than Paris, TI, and Bally's among the strip hotels.",2
The workers here have grown jaded from having to deal with university students on a daily basis. We sat a a dirty table for awhile before someone came in and finally cleaned it. I ended up getting a breakfast burrito which was fairly average. It's a place to go if you don't care about lazy service and want average diner food.,1
"the rooms are sooo comfortable. The staff is very pleasant and helpful. Anything I needed everyone was more than helpful. Food was good from the hotel and the hotel bar made tasty drinks. I love the tub relaxing I love the blackout shades, the kitchen and dining area in my room. I have intentions of returning soon.",2
"Almost as ghetto as the original, Carolina's North as we call it offers amazing and cheap Mexican food the greasy, cheesy kind and their tortillas are the best in town. Their signature red hot sauce is great, but not many people know you can get tasty green hot sauce or tastier pico for a small fee.",2
Do not get your oil changed here. They will charge you for oil that your car doesn't need. My truck only needs five quarts of oil and they added 6 quarts and charged me for the extra quart. I even showed them in the book where it says the truck only needs 5 quarts and they would not remove the charge.,1
"I like it! I like it! I like it! It's cheap and good. They salt the hell outta the fries and the burgers are grilled right in front of you. It's about 4 blocks south of the light rail, so it's easy to get to from the Light Rail. And you can get beer! The interior is dark, sparse and a bit run down, but that's what they are shooting for so, so be it. Basically a damn good burger at a good price.",2
"Not a bad place for happy hour. The beers were pretty cheap, and the food wasn't bad at all. There weren't many people here though. They were all next door at Firefly's. The place isn't big, but the service was really good. Probably for the fact that there weren't many people in there. Nice place for a happy hour menu though.",2
"Found Dr Romina on Phoenix mag listed best dermatologist. I tried botox and filler which made no difference at all. Wasted almost 1500 . Dr said she made me look natural! I am only not that I need a lot of filler botox. Also had facial peeling, aesthetician spilled the chemical on my lip which caused dark spot!",1
"This pizza is a thin crust that is fantastic! I am not gluten free but my best friend is and she ordered a fantastic pepperoni pizza and I could not tell the difference! Also the manager came out in and asked if we had any requests, we wanted gluten free beer which is Estrella Damm Daura, a gluten free beer, so we had of beer pizza party on site! Thank you Andy and crew! Capital awesome!",2
"Yes, this place gets packed as a bar in the evening hours, but peel away all that, and you have a decent Mexican restaurant. I have had the burritos, enchiladas, and tostadas. All good. The guac there is especially good and pair great with a Mexican beer, but then again, what doesn't go well with a Mexican beer. I will be back.",2
"First off, plan to share! The portions are HUGE. The egg rolls were hot, delicious and not at all greasy. Pork fried rice was perfect. I also had the BBQ pork and the flavor was excellent. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is about 1 2 of the pork slices were either tough or fatty. Otherwise a great place to order from.",2
"Zum zweiten Mal fiel die Unfreundlichkeit des Service mehr auf, wie die Qualit u00e4t der Speisen. Auf die Bitte ein gro u00dfes Insekt, es k u00f6nnte eine Kakerlake gewesen sein, von der Wand zu entfernen, reagierte die Bedienung patzich und mit Unverst u00e4ndnis u00fcber unsere Bitte. Never ever again.",1
"I'm glad to have a locally owned pet store in the neighborhood. We went in here looking for something for our new kitty to scratch, and received great service. As other people have said, they have a great selection of natural and organic pet food, toys, etc. It is a little pricy but I'm sure all of it is worth the money.",2
"Where the super hip chill and pontificate on the finer points of blunt rolling. Aside from being Super Hip, they are Ultra Cool Like 2 lame superhero characters, the are sexy as hell, fun to be around and you never know what the hell is really going on, but you know you are digging it. drinks are exotic, erotic and whet my tongue. Or was it that the sexy bartender chic?",2
"I went here with my girlfriends on a weekday at lunch time, and we were seated right away. The wine recommendations were excellent, and the food was great. I ordered the tomato and mozzarella as an entree, and it was delicious. My friends ordered a variety of food from salads to sandwiches, and we were all impressed. Great experience!",2
"The concept was nice but this place really didn't live up to expectations. There are some standard type store in it, but it doesn't seem to be a functional type mall as much as a tourist destination. The Rainforest Cafe was the highlight for me, which isn't really saying much. I didn't really find a whole lot of places I actually wanted to go into here.",1
"No complaints about the food whatsoever. All of us were more than happy with our meals. Steaks and side dishes creamed spinach, blue cheese scalloped potatoes were great, as were the duck fat fries. Only knocked down a star because you should never, ever have to listen to Carl Douglas' ""Kung Fu Fighting "" while eating in a steakhouse. Otherwise, a great experience.",2
The milk tea boba here sucks. It just taste like powder mix. I am usually a huge fan. All the other locations I have tried seem to get it right. Another sucky thing is they don't have the option for mini boba or popcorn chicken. This Lollicup is a gigantic FAIL! Corporate needs to whip this location into shape.,1
"After eating at the Essen Haus, this place is not comparable. I had the braut which was horrible compared to some of the bomb ones in Madison, and the Ruben. The Ruben was half bad but it's so commonplace that I forgot about it. My buddy and I also had a giant beer Spotted Cow? and that was really good but it was forgettable really compared to the delicious other beers I had in Madison.",1
"The Village Store is a handy little corner shop hosting everything you would need from a newsagents and a few more items thrown in too. I popped in for some crisps as I was feeling a little peckish, there was a great selection of crisps to choose from and the staff were very friendly too. They often have offers advertised and this weeks is buy one free on large bottles of cola, bargain!",2
"Forget the environment, go for the delicious food! The spicy curry vermicelli is what I get every time, after talking to a regular. The menu is big and daunting, so he helped me out by suggesting that, and you cannot go wrong with that or pretty much anything else. It is huge but always packed and amazing! Worth the wait, if there is one. Huge portions, and great prices too!",2
It was our first experience at this chain and will be our last. We only went there in the first place because we were real hungry and had limited choices in this shopping center. Nothing came close to tasting anything like Chinese food. It's just gross. We can't figure out why so many of these places exist and why anyone would want to eat at one.,1
"Awesome, awesome, awesome! The food was wonderful, the staff was cool maybe a little absent minded , great beer selection. The only negative I can think of is it is small and kind of a pain to find, but defiantly worth it once you do. There were so many things on the menu I still want to try. The green fennel and veggie hash were both great, but the prize goes to the Jalape u00f1o pecan pancakes.",2
"Seville Veterinary Hospital is a quality, caring business. Two out of three of my dogs have now been there. The staff is efficient and knowledgeable and understand that most people's pets are like family members. They offer numerous services for all pet related needs but do not push them unnecessarily.",2
"First customer today. Ordered a slice of pepperoni, sausage and mushroom with a side of mozzarella sticks and a coke. The sticks came out a bit burnt, need to turn the fryer down and cook a little longer. Pizza came out perfect. Crispy crust, great flavor. love coming over here, never a bad experience.",2
"I remember this place being a lot better. We live so close, and hadn't been in a few years so we decided to eat here. Bad idea. The service needs some improvement and the food was dry and tasted old. Our food was lacking in flavor. The one part I liked was the mason jars for drinking out of, that part was fun. I don't recommend.",1
This cleaners is completely out of line with their pricing. I have used the best cleaners in Los Angeles and they were never this expensive. I was given a 30 discount and it was still almost 9 dollars per shirt. Competitors in the area charge 5 6 range w o a coupon. If you want to throw away money go right ahead. I will not be using them again.,1
Love this place. I have never had a bad meal. Fajitas great. Enchiladas nrock. Carne Asada is out of this world. They catered a meal for 20 in January and we got tons of high fives. Wait staff is superb friendly ask for Miguel. We NEVER go to Laredos anymore with Casa in our backyard. Prices are reasonable as well. Juan runs a great operation.,2
"went there today 4 right after wk. the manager took care of what happened yesterday. I took the chance again and order 2 carne asada burros again,but told them to cook the steak in there grill they use real charcoal! the girls told me that it's going to take 20mins extra. I said that was fine. sure enough. the carne asada tasted waaaay better! wow! still needs to improvement.",1
"This place is a nice little spot in downtown Chandler they have an awesome selection of local brews as well as a great wine selection. Unfortunately, the food was impressively mediocre. The salad and fries were obviously thrown together in a few seconds .fries appeared to be store bought thick steak fries. The meat was high quality and so was the service. Beyond my overall impression was blahh.",1
"Bar staff is great and the crowd is friendly. The kitchen is either lazy or plain just does not give a hoot. I got the Turkey melt to go. Reads really tasty on the menu. Nice amount of turkey and bacon, but the bread was like uncooked french toast. Good place to have a beer and hear interesting conversations, but they need to work with the kitchen.",1
"3.5 stars Service took a tad long when we ate dinner but nothing too bad. Also was start of our bar crawl the following night so we started with drinks there. Nice atmosphere the outside seating has a beautiful view of the strip, it was cold when we went but would love to eat out there any other time. Worth a stop in if you pass by and hungry.",2
"Came here for a concert which was pretty cool. But the pool was kind of depressingly small and uninviting overall. The hot tub is a hole in the ground, and the drinks were pretty expensive. Perhaps it's just a small pool for a relatively small casino, but considering a lot of it looks new, it was just unimpressive overall.",1
"I went to Thai House Restaurant with my cousin for lunch. I like the inside, very quaint and cute. The lunch portion is good amount for the price. Servers are very nice and friendly. I got the lemon chicken and was pretty good, the rice seemed a little dry, but other than that, it's a good place and good for the money.",2
"We had a 20 coupon in our Luxor book so after not finding any cocktail waitresses on the floor, we decided to grab drinks here. Any 20 off of 20 coupon is awesome. Drink prices were super cheap for it being a bar and our server was pretty nice. There was an issue with using the coupon and new checks had to be printed three times but it all worked out.",2
"I loved Texas de Brazil, Las Vegas. The staff was friendly, food and drinks delicious! The salad bar had a variety of choices and the meats melted in my mouth. The sangria was very good. Even though I enjoyed my dining experience, I had to give it 2 stars because I had a Bridesmaids moment. It was really bad! If you've seen the movie Bridesmaids, you'll understand.",1
"Lunch special Thalis offer a nice variety. Otherwise, the rice dishes, e.g number 37, is another great option for people who enjoy tasting a little bit of everything, and want to avoid the stress of deciding which curries and rice or naan to order a la carte. Fair prices, tasty food, and comfortable location.",2
"Had to just walk out of here. They had a big party in the back room, and couldn't be bothered to help anyone else. We sat for 10 minutes before the server came to take our order. She didn't say hi, didn't say there would be a delay. Waited 20 more before asking how much longer. She didn't know. The only cook wasn't talking to her. We got up and left. This was Saturday at dinner time. Lame!",1
"Such a fun place! Lots of games, old and newer. Some were broken but that's the case with most arcades. Some games are more than others but if you look, there are some 5 ball games so you can get more play for your money. We were having so much fun, we closed the place down! I will definitely be back to visit next time I'm in town!",2
"Yes, the food is cheap but the service is horrible, they are rude there! nI don't don't believe you leave out of that place 100 happy. nNot to mention the sitting are bad, Everyone Everything is everywhere, everything is all over the place. I have only been there for lunch, but I have had better places where I get my money's worth.",1
"Great pho tai, the broth was very flavorful, everything was fresh and the service was friendy. An unusually bright new like ambiance, not your typical Vietnamese hole in the wall restaurant. I need my pho fix regularly and this was an all around good lunch experience. The usual ridiculously low prices as well.",2
"Love the bagels but the customer service at this location is very poor. I have come in more than once, not during rush, to have them remark that they are out of . No apology. Just the facts. When ordering to go, have on more than one occasion, waited more than 15 min. Will probably not return, took awhile, but I've learned my lesson. Voting with my dollar.",1
"B N started out as my college bookstore, oh, so many years ago in lower Manhattan. Well what happened? Clearly, they took on a crowded field and won. Bye bye Borders, etc. This particular B Ns is in a nice location. The odd shaped parking lot can be dangers if you're not careful. They're a lot of dashing in and out near the entrance, but a great store with nice employees who are very helpful!",2
Two words for all you Yelpsters out there Jamaican widow. It's not on the menu but its a mix between the Jamaican red and the white widow and ask for extra ranch. I use to go there a couple times a week then I moved so I don't get to go as much as I would like. The employees are awesome and the owners are super friendly so enjoy.,2
"Like so many places you will find in Vegas, this place offers average service with average food for a high price. It's convenient for the guests of the Flamingo that can visit for a quick breakfast, but the food is bland! My advice is to skip this place entirely and walk over to The Quad for much better food at a much better price at Hash House a Go Go!",1
"They pick up your food and not far from where is my table, just next to the entrance, there's a bin where the empty dishes go. The waiter throw the dishes instead of putting the dishes in the bin and that is so noisy for the ears. The noise seemed to be forever. The design of the table were nice and our waiter also.",1
"I was there on a Friday. Not too crowed. Enjoyed the atmosphere but nothing special. I had the lobster tacos starter. It was OK. Not bad but not great. When you try to make mexican food too fancy, you miss the boat. Its albout fresh ingredients and decent portions. The margaritas were a little sour and had to ask them to sweeten it just a tad. Excellent wait staff.",1
"We have tried this place two times. Food was decent at best the first time for dinner. The second time we walked out before our meal even started due to the dry burnt food on the buffet and rude service. It's now an ongoing joke in our household of ""are you hungry enough to even eat at China Town? "" nWe're shocked it's survived this long with so little customers.",1
"I started training 4 weeks ago with Seth. The first few sessions were tough. I began getting stronger right away, and appreciated the encouragement from Seth. I am well on my way to reaching my goals and actually really look forward to the 5 30 am workouts! Thanks to Seth for helping me get my body and strength back!",2
"If they hadn't changed their location, it was a sure shot 5 stars! The old location inside University Square mall was just awesome. The food was unbelievably tasty and cheap! The food's still good, but the price is slightly higher now, given the nicer location. I'd give it a try if I'm in the vicinity.",2
"We got a 2 for 1 deal at this place due to the package our room came with. It was definitely the best meal I had in Vegas. We had patio brunch there, and I ordered some kind of cheese omelette. I love good cheese, and this was probably the best I've had on an omelette. nService was good, and the only annoying thing about the patio is the noise of the slots.",2
"Went to 21 night last night, beer and wine are 5 6 but don't come expecting to get drunk, lines are ridiculous. Watch the demonstrations and it's super fun to be there without all the kids. Kind of ran out of steam after 3 hours, couldn't really drink more, saw everything, wish there were a few more attractions. Overall it was a really good time.",2
"ok so this place is great and was really fun to have dinner at. its like Japanese tapas exploding in your mouth. at one point the owner chef came to our table to say hello, he was very nice, and offered to make something special that turned out to be yummy. would definitely come back over and over again. thanks for the good time. a new fave!",2
"I love this place, such a wonderful restaurant with great authentic food. Love the fact that it is hidden away, you can sit inside or outside on their patio on the pond year round! When you make your reservation, reserve a table outside. Great for groups, and even better for date night. I will be going back soon!",2
Came here with my best friend Peyton. We made the reservation a month earlier. One thing I didn't care for was the fact that they charge 100 if you don't show for your reservation even though there is a long line to get in. nThe food was great. We split the t bone and pork. Both were cooked perfectly. The prices were very high but that's what you come to expect in Vegas.,2
I have been getting these sandwhiches since I was 11! The number 9 Mike's way is the WAY to go. Other than that I really love the staff here. Always friendly and make excellent sandwiches some locations make better than others ! Thanks guys! Also if you want to try them for lunch pre order online. Can't stand lines and it's waiting for me right when I specify I'll be their to pick it up.,2
"Arrived at 7 05 and ordered. It is now 7 35 and still no food. There are only a handful of patrons in here. Everyone that came in and ordered a smoothie was served within minutes, but for some reason it takes well over 30 minutes to make a salad and a sandwich? Awful. They can handle a lunch rush but not a drizzle of evening customers? Not coming back.",1
"this place was so kawaii! great for everyone unless you hate chocolate ! 4 floors of fun n before you buy something on one floor. STOP and go thru all the floors. because it gets better as you go up. and if youre on a budget you kind of regret of not getting this when you got that. lol Customer service was great too, they were cute and so helpful and funny !",2
"Dear God, the coconut doughnuts. I love them. It's just doughnut, glaze, and coconut but when they come together the result is otherworldly. I feel certain that it melts in your mouth but, like the owl in those Tootsie Pop commercials, I cannot leave the doughnut in my mouth long enough to test my theory. I want to marry coconut doughnut.",2
"I love LOVE this buffet because it is ALWAYS clean and I never feel gross after stuffing myself because it is a salad buffet. I am addicted to their chickeoodle soup, I seriously cannot get enough. I recommend grabbing a blueberry muffin and asking the guy behind the counter for the honey whipped butter they don't leave it out anymore . Together the two are sinful!",2
So I read some of the reviews and was a little scared but car wasn't running and I had a house full of boys and low on funds so I ordered from here. This was a great choice. I got 2XL pizzas for 20 anyway I wanted. Everyone loved it. I didn't like that I asked for extra cheese and didn't get it but other than that the pizza was delicious. Would definitely order from here again.,2
"Wow. I just gave up on my burger and fries. There was absolutely no flavor and I hate to waste precious calories and stomach room on worthless food. I had the Dante burger which had cheap blue cheese and a ""garlic aoli "" aka plain mayo. I have never had sweet potato fries that taste like nothing even after a packet of salt and add to that completely flavorless ranch dressing until now.",1
"This place is friggin terrible. A friend and I walked in please note the door says walk ins are welcome to do basic pedicures. We immediately asked if we had appointments, which we did not. There was only 2 people there and it smelled gross. The lady then told us that they cant take us because we didnt have an appointment. Good job losing business!",1
Went here for happy hour one night. Good luck trying to get a seat at the bar which you have to be at in order to get the happy hour prices. The tacos were good and reasonably priced but the drinks were way over priced even on happy hour. It's an older crowd with mostly Cougars on the prowl. Shame because I really wanted to love this place but we won't be back.,1
"I've dined at Fiamma numerous times to take advantage of local specials and seasonal tasting menus. Have pretty well eaten my way through the menu. The calamari is a favorite! Other notable dishes are raviolini, linguini, tagliata, brasato and gamberoni. The panna cotta is my go to dessert. Service has varied from acceptable to very good.",2
"Not sure how drunk the negative reviewers were but I have been coming here 3 4 times per year and have had wonderful experiences. nFriendly helpful staff, great location, comfortable beds and accommodations, reasonable pricing, free internet and calls, no resort fees, and on and on. Ck them on your next visit.",2
Worst Mexican food EVER.ordered enchilada got the wrong order.snotty slow hostess asked what my problem was. When I asked to talk to the manager she said he was not there. It was the dinner hour. Before going here take some bland cooked chicken throw it on a piece of White bread pour salsa on that and save yourself ,1
Over priced and under delivered. The salmon was slimy and a bit too soft. The food tasted bland as if its shelf life was within sight. Overall I paid too much to wait as long as we did for the food to come out. Won't go there again. Sushi station on Tatum is much cheaper and has simple yet straightforward food which is as of equal or better quality as what I tasted there.,1
My husband and I got here a couple times a year. Always except my veggies today get great food at a decent price. I love their side salad. which has raisins and sunflower seeds. Burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken Mac and cheese. Recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat.,2
This place is decent when it comes to nails but they will not take you in even you come in at 6 50 they close at 7 which I think is horrible because other nail places will take you even at the time of closing. I will never go there again especially after the horrible service they gave me the last time I was there.,1
I went to lunch here with my new boss and new coworker and I absolutely loved it! The place is so quaint and cute inside.love the exposed brick walls. And the food was great as well.I got the salmon with the veggie casserole on their specials list and a side salad. Perfect sized portions for lunch. And the service was perfect as well. I would definitely come back here!,2
" 16 for a 20 minute walk through a small aquarium just wasn't really worth it. They didn't even have that many sharks to look at, or that many varieties of sharks for that matter. Some cool fish and such, but I can't say it was really worth my time and money. I'd much rather go to the Dallas World Aquarium.",1
"I took my dad there today to give him some dim sum experience. The food was good, and was ready in a reasonable amount of time maybe due to the fact that we came there after peak hour . Like other reviewers have mentioned, there is not really what you would normally call ""service "", you get your own tea, chop stick and clean up after yourselves. but i am fine with that. A good experience overall.",2
"ok im a little biased because my uncle is head chef. so one star just for that. if you love seafood, especially crab and sushi, you can load up here for a pretty reasonable price. all i ate was a bunch of crab and sashimi so thats what my review is based on.if you're like me and love seafood, to eat like this would cost 60 100 bucks easy.so get there early and enjoy!",2
"Awful experience at normally reliable restaurant. Service was slow and inattentive. Food was overcooked, undercooked, or came out cold or soggy. Scallops were particularly bad texture was mushy like pre frozen Costco fare. I will never do dinner there again. Though I will be back for the lobster club at lunch. . . ",1
"We went there on a slow Wed night, the wait time for our order was a LONG TIME. The fries came to the table warm NOT hot the hamburger was dry. The chili size was so mild even the hottest sauce didn't help it, very tasteless. Waitress dis interested in waiting on our table not friendly at all . Def will not go back save yourself go somewhere else Please.",1
"Denver omelette with hash browns and bicuits and gravy.big enough for two. Great service and delicious meaty omelettes. 20 minute wait on a Saturday at 10 am, but worth waiting for. If you are from san diego think "" family house resteraunt ""! Friendly prompt service, roll back to the 70's! Upgraded atmosphere would make it 5 stars, was loud and ""open "" seating, family style!",2
" ""Wow! "", I couldn't help but blurt that out after one bite into the Striped Sea Bass. I have never tasted fish so flavorful with a light crispy layer. Everything was outstanding. Best of all, the Chef and staff were very friendly and didn't mind me taking pictures of every dish as it came out. Best time to go is mid week between 6 7pm, talk about great, friendly service!",2
"Dear Cherry Bar, nYou suck out loud. nYou suck so bad the old owner had to take the bar back. nThat's how badly you sucked. nFrom the constant identity crisis,to the bad DJ's,to the bar staff that made up prices entirely on whims,Cherry,you suck. nI'm so glad you're gone. nWelcome back Friends Again. nThanks for saving Phoenix from this nightmare.",1
its ok. visited on a tuesday night. had the chicken fried rice. chicken dry. egg rolls were good with the right amount of spice but the rest of the family's meal which was a bit of everything was all in all nothing different or unique than any Thai take out joints. just ok. service just ok. price average. lets just say not memorable.,1
"Love this place! I have to say that I find myself driving out of my way for it. I am a huge fan of the spicy, the limu, and the furikake. They are incredibly kind and offer free samples too! What I really hate about this place is that it closes so early! BUT. for some of you who cannot make it by closing. you can call ahead. and they will have it waiting for you on the restaurant side.",2
"When I first started frequenting this place's Sunday night happy hour, I loved it. I would go with a group of friends, and it was always a great time. Over the last few months, I have seen a decline in the quality of food, service, and an increase in prices. Happy hour is still pretty decent prices, and the food hasn't been bad, it just isn't as good as it used to be, unfortunate really.",1
"This place is AMAZING! You can get a huge salad for 5 bucks. They have veggie style fries. The burgers are delish! I'm so glad they opened by UNLV. The staff is very friendly. The atmosphere is warm, cool and inviting. What a wonderful place. Only drawback is I wish they had a baby diaper changing table in the women's restroom.",2
"Good food. Awful service. The waiter was nowhere to be found when we needed our check, even though we slotted 2 hrs to get through our meal, kept our order super simple, told our server upfront when we needed to leave. We had to ask 2 other staff and finally chase him down on foot as he walked away while we continually said ""excuse me. "" I won't be back.",1
"Amazing! Wish I came here earlier in my trip. We had the french toast, and hh benedict with the tangerine mimosas. Food was CRAZY. Large portions and loved how it all tasted. Waiter told us to try the pancakes which bakes bananas and other stuff inside instead of on top! Definitely try the mimosas, so gooood!",2
I will not fly on this airlines again. Terrible service provided by employees who are clearly not caring about delivering good service. Then to get on a plane that was filthy.peanuts in a bag found in the pocket. And the dirtiest seats. And then they charge you for everything a la carte taken way too far. I will pay extra for better employees and cleanliness,1
"We used Dickey's to cater our rehearsal dinner. The food was fabulous and so affordable! They also supplied the plates, napkins, and plastic ware. We chose to have the beef brisket and pulled pork, the mac n cheese, the baked potato casserole, and baked beans. We also had them cater dessert which was delicious. Loved the food, loved the price!",2
"Went with a party of 10, went family style and two hours later still no entree. Manager understood the frustration, and said server was new. Manager comped the bill, but didn't eat the food after two hours. Waste of my time, and the restaurants supposed service. Disappointing in both expectation and execution.",1
"I have been to several of these, mostly Tatum Cactus. Although they are speedy and attentive to you, the quality is poor. They always do a subpar job on your vehicle, probably because they are so rushed. The attention to detail is missed. Especially with the amount of money you pay them for the service, you would think that the quality would be much better.",1
"This is not Chicago style. Ordered an Italian beef and polish dog. Neither reminded me of Chicago. Polish tastes more like a regular hot dog and after 2 bites, I couldn't eat it anymore. Italian beef was ok but like how my boyfriend pointed it out, it's not soggy or good enough. Even the beer tastes funky. Ordered a blue moon and returned it for a colors light but it was still tasting wrong.",1
"If all natural means dry and bland, then this cupcakes are definitely ""natural. "" nI was super excited to try Lulus, and then was quickly disappointed. They were out of everything and the cake texture was like cardboard. Whipped frosting? ummm where is my cream cheese? nSave your 3 and go grab a happy hour beer.",1
"I have gone to Holley's since they opened and it remains my go to for meetings, friend time and really special brews. Heart of Darkness everytime. Love the quiet, airy feel of mornings there. Perfect way to start the day. Food is awesome too but i always give in to the cheesiest whatever so cant speak to the healthy options!",2
"Love the food! I always order the pomegranate chicken salad, with a side of bread and make my own pomegranate chicken sandwhich. More often thaone the service is great, however everyone once in a while you get the ""Im too cool to work here and serve you "" attitude. Minor annoyance, worth living through for the food.",2
"I'm upset with this place. I've been to 3 other In and Outs and I don't care for this one. nThere have been several times that we got pink meat in the burgers. I mean completely pink. It's overly greasy and dripping with the liquid fat. nIf you like In and Out there are better ones and if I compared this place to 5 Guys, 5 Guys wins hands down.",1
"This is not the closest Starbucks to me, but it's the closest one with a drive through. and sometimes I'm just that lazy! The people working the window have always seemed really happy to see me? or to be working? or what, I don't know, but it at least makes for a pleasant experience in the 2 minutes it takes to pay and grab my cup.",2
It was my second time to visit tonight. Great service. Very pleasant atmosphere. I ordered the chopped salad. The best salad in town! It is interesting and more than just a pile of lettuce. I love the variety of salsas too. Great flavors. Very interesting choices. Fresh and reasonable. I love that it is a neighborhood restaurant that offers excellent food and wonderful service. Love it!,2
The food here is definitely a two and the bar at night is probably up to a three sometimes but usually a two. I've never seen a good crowd of people in here and even with few customers service can be slow at times. They do have some decent sized TV's to watch sports on and sometimes it seems to be majority female in here so it is worth popping in for one beer every now and then.,1
"I reserved my table through Open Table and the staff was helpful and friendly throughout the entire process for a special occasion. Great place to dine and killer view. Come early to get the best spot Its not very costly when compared to a red lobster or any other place. Overall, great experience and we will come again.",2
"This review is for the Blue Man Group's group services coordinator. We had a group of 50 people wanting to attend the show at the Venetian and Kathleen was amazing! She made the process hassle free from ordering the tickets, quickly responding to questions and emails to picking them up at the office. It was great customer service and our group enjoyed the show!",2
"Walking into this place you are greeted promptly and pleasantly by whom ever is behind the counter. nThe place is clean and comfy, menu is clear and inexpensive. In San Francisco I use to frequent an establishment like this, and I'm excited to have found this place. nThey have fresh juice guava, wht peach, lychee and more mimosas. The homemade chorizo is off the hook. nFood is GREAT!",2
If you're looking for a fancy place.you're not going to find it. If you're looking for the best Pho in town.this is it! Fantastic broth every time! I've been to plenty of Pho places here in the Phoenix and Tucson areas but in my opinion this is the best. Love the spring rolls too. I've been coming here for the past 20 years and still love it!,2
"Simple decor, friendly service and great simple food. With a Portuguese style, Braseiro serves up deliciously grilled meats and seafood in paprika red oils. I tried the whole sardines and calamari not fried! yum . Both were bursting with flavor and the integrity and moisture of the seafood was perfectly encapsulated by their preparations.",2
"I think this place is SCRUMPTIOUS! You can text them in advance for the sandwich you like and they will have it ready for you. I thought the Foie was delicious, albeit a little rich. I wish they had a Turkey selection. They did have a Tuna Melt as a special to which I hope they make it part of their menu.",2
"Wish i would've known about this place yesterday sunday since they were open and my teenager tells me at the last minute that he needs a sports physical for basketball tryouts by Monday after school! nStaff here is super friendly and funny nWe will be back, especially since physicals are only 35 no appt necessary.",2
"This restaurant is awesome. Love the atmosphere although a little too dim and the menu selection. I usually come here on Tuesdays when it's happy hour all day. Their guacamole, some tacos, and other small bites are on the HH menu. I can eat a full meal sharing the guac appetizer and 3 tacos for about 12? it's a great deal! oh, but their desserts are nothing to write home about.",2
"The mini desserts from this place that M Resort Studio Buffet serves are pretty good so I decided to try a cupcake from this place. I got the Coconut Pineapple one and what a HUGE disappoinment. The frosting didn't even taste like frosting but something artificial. In fact, I can make better cupcakes. Needless to say will not be buying from here again.",1
Place stunk as soon as we walked in bathrooms were a mess and the carne asada tasted old and nasty the water was nasty. Halfway through my burrito my son spilled the red salsa all over my plate and im glad he did cause there was a bug in it I spit out what was in my mouth threw everything out and left. Im sure they must have had a bad night tonight but will not be going back.,1
"This is the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. I know it's in the same plaza as Lotus and many people like it, but Komol is my kind of place. They recognize regulars, serve some of the most amazing traditional Thai dishes and you really can't beat their prices. If you have veg friends, this is the place!",2
I was happy to find the Ranger IPA on tap. Went to watch a football game with friends and found the tv screen side of things to be just right. The reason for 2 stars is the food. It reminded me a lot of cafeteria food in Junior High. I ordered a burger and found the quality of meat to be a bit low. I like that the fries still have the edge of the potato on them but they were far from crisp.,1
"Slimy owner Kami Eshragi tried to give alder Austin King a run for his money in the elections last year, but turned out to be out or touch with students. After watching his conduct in the election I will never go here again, but when I did it was a dark place with a very diverse crowd. Eat dinner on huge matresses surrounded by curtains.kinda shady. Good dance scene. 1 Star",1

I guess that is how they make money considering that the hotel fee is low. No kids menu in any restaurant.",1
"Great family run business! Friendly, safe, affordable and fun. I've been on 5 different ATV rides in Las Vegas with 5 different companies. All were great but this one was the best! New equipment and a nice variety to the terrain that we covered. Definitely give them a try if you're looking to do something fun in Las Vegas!",2
This place was awesome. The owners were very helpful and were engaging with the ALL of their customers. It appears like they love their job and it shows. You rarely see this these days. The food was amazing as well. I can't wait to find an excuse to be on that side of town again so I can enjoy their tasty food!,2
"There is no security at this place! I had a birthday party on a Saturday and 2 females got into a fight with no regard of thee children playing! Not safe, kids in my party were really scared! So were thee parents! Not any fun if people are going to be getting into fights with no security around until police get call and have 2 wait till they arrive! I'm still upset over this!",1
"Delicious! Home fries chopped potatoes sooo good. Have to be crispy though. They make the best poached eggs, and they are cage free They have the best jam I have ever tasted. Its locally sourced without high fructose corn syrup and GMO bullsheet. Great service as well, everyone is sooo sweet from the host to the servers.",2
When I moved to Nevada I would stop here at least once a week for an order of liver and onions which was amazing . I would always get gravy on the liver until recently. The restaurant started to charge 2.00 for gravy. Who orders liver and onions without gravy? I refused to be nickel and dim ed! That being said tonight will be the last time I visit this restaurant.,1
"I was pretty disappointed with Unknown. Their space is fine, though a sunny patio would be nice. But on a fairly slow afternoon the bartenders tended to ignore us, and they don't have samplers of their beer on offer. And their beer was pretty unmemorable. With better options in the area, it's hard to recommend Unknown.",1
"Brought my mom who was in town , son, and boyfriend here. The food was so amazing that my mom called my dad in California to let him know how great it was. We all enjoy good food and LOVE breakfast, so we are SO happy to have chosen this spot. It will be our ONLY breakfast place. Yoli's never disappoints. I don't know why I ever go anywhere else.",2
I took my BF out to Country Club at the Wynn for brunch last weekend. We had the buffet and the food was excellent! We were seated outside patio and had a wonderful view of the waterfall and golf course. The service was great until the waiter kept forgetting to put my order in French toast bread pudding a must try so we had to wait longer which wasn't too bad since we had a great view.,2
"Only place I have gambled at in 10 years, so this last year I stayed there twice. One time just got a deluxe room, the next I got a Penthouse suite with an attached room. Both times were terrible, the second time we couldnt get into our room until 2 plus hours after check in time, and the promised attached room was on the other end of hotel. The Wynn will be getting my business now.",1
"This is my parents local Chinese restaurant, and somewhere that I am often taken for dinner. Honestly, it beats a lot of Chinese take aways in Suburbia hands down. The fact that they've taken dim sum and jellyfish and managed to sell it to the people of Longstone says a lot! Try the stuffed aubergine in black bean sauce, it is tres yum.",2
"Meh, I don't get the big deal over this place. Ordered the Mel's ""special "" breakfast toast, eggs, taters, and a side dish with a milkshake and it came to 10. It may sound okay to some but that was one of the most mediocre dishes I've ever had certainly not worth 10. Buy yourself some eggs and fancy bread and you'll be much more satisfied.",1
"We ate here yesterday for CultMTL's birthday party, so the options were limited. But they had a bunch of sandwiches sald. I tried the pulled pork super yummy and my wife tried the vegetarian which she really liked. It's a cool spot, though yesterday was very crowded. I'd be intrigued to visit again though. Yummy food, rooftop, and beer, are all yes yes yes to me.",2
"Their Beef patties are frozen out of a box, but they are still good. If you ever have a craving for a beef patty and a ting Jamaican sprite made with REAL sugar , this is the place. I will note the place looks like its closed. They haven't replaced the piece of plywood covering the broken window in over a year.",2
I shop at Sally's quite often but HATE this location. The employes always look like they would be someplace else and rarely is there more than one cashier working. My last visit I waited in line for over 10 minutes while one cashier rang while another closed her till and another employee chatted on her cell in the back room loud enough for me to hear. Go to another location and avoid this one!,1
"Went this restaurant last weekend for a late breakfast. Had SUPER Sweet with TONS of whipped cream triple chocolate cappuccino, tasted just okay Egg white omelet, and weird sour flavor smoked salmon Benedict. The place is fancy, however, the food is not okay and the price is a little bit too high. Maybe I should just order liquor or dessert over there next time.",1
"Went with my wife and 1 yr old. Odd that there was no hostess table. Perhaps they were under staffed today, but it took a while to be greeted and order taken. Large coffee cups were very nice. Enjoyed the fresh coffee. I also liked the decor. Took forever for food to arrived. It was very good, but portions are small. I don't plan on going back again.",1
"This is hands down the most horrible casino I have ever stayed at. 2nd night we wake up to the ceiling dripping water and having hotel employees in and out of our room, early morning. 3rd. Night no running water at all in our room. So the toilet is full, no can wash there hands and no showers before we catch our flight. There is plenty if other casino's in Vegas, I will never use this one again.",1
"I loves me an IKEA trip, I'm not really into their furniture anymore, but as far as their wall shelves and some decor, the price can't be beat, all of our glasses and dishes are from IKEA and I have no urge to update them. I love checking out the Ikeahackers website to see what creative things people are doing with their products.",2
"For the do it yourselfer, or aspiring do it yourselfer, like me this place is a gold mine. It's all about the staff and the crew at this store is eccellent. They have talked me through may repairs and helped me get set with the right parts. I find AutoZone parts to be reasonably priced and good quality.",2
"Food was good albeit expensive, but the girl working there was rude when I was trying to be nice. There are so many great places to eat in charlotte, I will not go to a place where the staff is rude. There is some really great ""med "" places to eat at on South blvd that will be getting my business instead.",1
"I liked the food. The service was good. The atmosphere is nice. I didn't feel well afterward, so that's why I gave them 2 stars. There are other complaints in yelp reviews that say they became ill, and I ignored them to try this place out for myself. I hope to give this place another shot in 12 months' time.",1
"This place used to be good, and well worth the money and the time spent in the line. Not anymore. The selection and quality of food was anything but good. It was edible, but tasteless. The meat selection and quality was rather bad, and so was the sushi. It sure is not worth the 37 dinner or the 45 mins wait.",1
"Had lunch here, ate the lobster roll. Can't taste the lobster. No presentation at all. Worst of all, I got very sick afterwards. Ruined my whole vacation. This is what happens when you get too big and famous. You can't possibly know what all your restaurants are doing. Sad! You can't even pay me to eat here again. Everyone in my party were disappointed.",1
"Food and service was excellent. Had lunch with my dad there and we were both satisfied with our choices. Dad got the sashimi salad and I got the ahi tuna burger with kale slaw. The menu is interesting and gives plenty of fun healthy options. For dessert we had the pistachio gelato, the texture was good but it was a bit to creamy for me. Overall great place for lunch",2
"Very, very disappointed. nThey removed my favorite appetizer shrimp scampi from the menu. nThe waiter told me they can still make it! nWhen it arrived, it was tiny little shrimp, gummy, not seared. They removed my husbands favorite dish seafood cannelloni . They raised prices reduced sizes! What's happening!? I wont return.",1
"Service was fantastic, everyone was incredibly helpful and SO NICE! We had Nate as our server who was just the nicest dude I've had as a server! nBut the greatest part was of course the FOOD! Florentine eggs benedict AMAZING! Was just a wonderful place all around. nAND! They carry stevia in their sugar caddies! Definitely one of my favorite little touches.",2
I would refer anyone to have Az Celebrity DJ to emcee their event. Joe did a great job for our reception and wedding at Superstition Springs Golf Course. He kept the party moving and our guests commented on how awesome our DJ was. If we ever have another big event I'd love to have Joe back! Thanks for making our wedding day fun and memorable!,2
I'm not a big fan of this place to begin with.but a friend wanted to go to watch the basketball finals. Got the nachos.definitely no good. I also ordered a Tangier a and tonic.Also no good. If you decide to go here.stick with the wings. Otherwise.I recommend that you don't come here. I won't be back.,1
"Well this place used to have good food, but not anymore. My chicken was tougher than leather, bland and flavorless. My husbands's filet was pounded to a paper thin piece of meat. Who does that. The bread basket was good, and that was about it. 200 for paper filet, leather chicken, and a couple of drinks. Don't eat here. nOverrated and way over priced.",1
Good food. Good prices. 20 wings is 12.95. That's a smoking deal. With a large pepperoni pizza came out to 26 out the door. But we stayed in the door. Watched soccer sitting in their comfortable racing style seating. Dude was In such a good mood when Greece scored he brought out some complimentary garlic knots.,2

"Finally authentic Al Pastor here in Vegas. I worked in Mexico and then moved to Vegas 16 years ago. I have searched the entire city since then to find true Mexican ""street "" tacos. El gordo has them. Fantastic Pastor, Asada, y Lengua tambien! Roasted chilies and green onion at the end of the counter is a nice touch.",2
Horrible service and slow to boot. The only reason they get 2 stars is that they're close to my house and the food is delicious. But I won't be coming back just because they let the lines get too full too easy. And they don't want to smile or pretend like they care. Plus the area it's in brings in the less than comfortable crowd.,1
"You can get some good discounts here, and a lot of bulk items such as granola, spices, and nuts. The store is kind of like walking into a warehouse, with minimal decor and more of an industrial feel. Aisles are easy to navigate through, and there's a decent selection of foods that you would need. To keep prices low, they only accept debit if you pay by card.",2
Traci is the best! I highly recommend her for a relaxing massage or a sports massage or any stressed muscles that needed attention. I am a professional athlete and I have followed Traci for years and I will continue to see her for my massages. I have recommended her to friends that have also benefited from her awesome massages.,2
"This is my FAVORITE sushi place in town.I LOVE the decore and the food is so so so good. I will recommend The shrimp Shumai, Scallop Dynamite, Rock Shrimp as food for Sushi It's ALL good. I believe my favorite though is the Morning Dew a soy paper one and the Cabo Blanco. I really don't feel as though i have anything more to say except GO HERE! Simple and to the Point. Enjoy.",2
I am trying to leave this bank due to personal issues with the way my mortgage and reconstruction from flooding was handled. Worst customer service for home finances and don't expect any help in getting resolution for financial questions in this department. Not per say this branch but all the company as a whole. I do like the polite staff at this branch. Planning to move funds soon.,1
Found this place by accident after a visit to the Galleria mall. n Started with Tom yum soup which was very good. We then ordered 2 dishes. nMixed veggies with squid and saut u00e9ed tofu nand veggies with garlic sauce. Both dishes nwere delicious. The service was also very good. n Babcock 9 is a great find and we will definitely be returning for another great meal.,2
"Maybe I'm just spoiled but this place is sub par. Been to the one in Sq. Hill were there is line on the weekends and a wait of anywhere from 10 30 min. I've only been there when there was no line and I despise myself each time I finish my food thinking ""I could have gone home and put extra scoop of lard on my eggs and it would have cost less than 1 4 of what I payed at Pamela's "".",1
Recently ate here because we couldn't find anything closer at the time. Service was slow and not friendly. Burgers are small and don't come with fries or onion rings. Fries or onion rings will cost you 5 dollars. I ordered the bbq burger and it was nothing special. At around 13 dollars I will probably not plan on going back.,1
"It's Arcadia. That's about all I like about it. I don't like the decor for many reasons. It reminds me of a long bowling alley, things I can overlook if the burgers were better. The burgers are dry and don't taste of much. For instance, the peppercorn borger barely had any hing of pepper flavor. The fries are okay, at least they have good beer.",1
"This was my favorite stop on Saddlebag Trail on a recent trip to Scottsdale. The staff was friendly and the drinks were reasonably priced. The place did not have the huge lines like Hi Fi and Whiskey Row which even made it more popular to my group. Also, there is a mini skee ball game in the back and a lost found vending machine.",2
"I too was excited I found Picazzo's on my GF phone app! Showed up shortly after they opened and ordered GF pizza slices. The pizza slices were barely warm as if they were sitting in a warmer. We ordered pepperoni mushroom pizza and the toppings WERE not cooked enough. The side salad, ew! I guess it's too much to ask for a freshly prepared HOT GF organic pizza slice. NOT GOOD for the price!",1
Everyone was extremely helpful with my first visit here. The staff helped me immediately upon arriving and throughout both my initial visit and when I went back to pick up my glasses. Dr. McMullen took his time with me and explained all the procedures and what options I had available. I am very happy with my new glasses. Highly recommend their services.,2
"Newman Realty has been a member of the Gilbert Chamber of Commerce for several years now. The organization and staff are committed to the long term growth and development of businesses of all sizes in Gilbert. We have found the Chamber to be a great source for both business and personal development. Highly recommended for business networking, growth and development.",2
"This is where Strippers retire and become cocktail waitresses. This place is nails! I stayed here for 5 days and loved everyone. The service, the quality and the cocktail waitresses make this place my FAVORITE place to stay in Vegas. The rooms are large, the bathrooms have TV's and the sports book is KILLER. nRestraunts are also top notch!",2
"My German shorthaired pointer I just loved D Pet Hotel! We go for puppy daycare 1 2 days a week also we have boarded him there. The staff is amazing so friendly, you definitely feel comfortable leaving you dog with them. They are open 7 days a week until 7pm which is great for those who work . Just a fabulous place, your dog will love it!",2
"I remember Bianco's before the hype and can't bring myself to suffer the crowds and horrendous wait for a pizza. Not knocking it, it's a good pizza but it's a pizza. I cringe when out of town guests suggest going here and I carefully steer them to Cibo or Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana. Both are just as good and at Pomo you get that amazing limoncello. Bianco's is the Trevi fountain of pizza in Phoenix.",1
"The food was tasty but the service was ridiculously bad. I cannot emphasize how poor the service was. I used to like this place. I'll never go there again. nIf you enjoy being ignored this is the place for you. If you like and expect good service and are willing to pay for it, go somewhere else. BJs and Yard House have them beat a 100 times over. Don't go to 3 angry.",1
My poodle gets so excited when she goes for grooming. I don't even have to lead her in. I open the car door and she runs in. They are very patient and caring with Bella and she always looks great every time I pick her up. I've been with them for several years now and would not go any where else.nor would my poodle.,2
"Have you ever wondered who still smokes Benson Hedges? Well here you go. Loved the old school Vegas signs and turning Freemont Street into a promenade. Hated the overhead light show, it completely ruins the sightlines of the old casino signs. Scared sh tless of most of the people there we were waiting for people to get pick pocketed or shived.",1
Not really customer service oriented. I called up to get ginger added to my Broccoli Beef take out order which I was placing and they said they will not do that even if I paid more for the ginger. I decided not to eat there and refuse to do so now. I recently was in the area and still can't go back in after the initial bad taste in my mouth of bad service.,1
"When there are so many other great pools in Vegas, why go here? I highly doubt I would ever go back here again. I was expecting ambiance, but got none. I want some lushness and a place to relax. This is not such a place. Boring, not much going on, very small pool, sound sucks, etc. Sure, it's free for ladies like every other topless pool in Vegas , but even free won't entice me back here.",1
"The food here is delicious, but I wish they had more authentic Greek foods like taramasalata and gigante beans. It sounds like they sometimes offer these items, but I wish these items were on the regular menu. There is outdoor seating, and the wait staff are courteous and friendly. The prices are reasonable too.",2
I applied for a auto loan refinance at a very attractive 2.98 . From the initial call to signing the documents it took 4 business days and a very smooth transaction. I met with Monika M. today at the branch where she had all documents ready to be reviewed and signed. Thank you for a professionalism and attention to detail.,2
"Sit at the sushi bar and let them impress you. Ask for Steve I didn't have a single disappointing item, and I can safely say that this is the best sushi I have had in Charlotte. The servers pretended not to speak English until a woman in our party called one of them out as a phony. After he broke character, he served us some of the most creative sushi dishes I've ever had.",2
Check your order! I've been too many Firehouse's in the valley and this one is by far the worst at following directions. I've been to this location 5 times and all 5 times they screw up my order. What part of No Onions and No Tomatoes is hard? I will drive out of my way to avoid this location in the future.,1
"Had a party of 14 seniors, and came here the on recommendation of several of them. Service was worse than terrible. Some of us got their order the rest of us got the wrong thing and we all waited 1 to 2 hours for our correct order. had to beg for drink refills and even for our check. The food was good but not hot enough. Will not be coming back",1
I wouldn't recommend this place. The bar hasn't been cleaned in who knows how long. The coolers are disgusting. This was a terrible experience! If I was an owner I'd be appalled at the condition this place is in. Absolutely disgusting. I should submit the photos I took to the health board. Filthy establishment.,1
"I brought all my friends with me to check out this sushi bar. It's very lounge like. However, we went on the weekend so we didn't have time to enjoy the 14 dollar all you can eat sushi. which I would have appreciated to know very very much! I'll definitely come back during the week with my boyfriend. Love this place!",2
"OMG I love Costco! I would give 5 stars but I wouldn't say this is the BEST Costco. The one is Scottsdale is PRIMO. They have super duper premium wines, liquors, jewelry, etc. But my Cave Creek location is HOME! Great customer service all of the time. I go there just to walk around and eat samples sometimes! ",2
"We arrived 4 30 PM the door was opened with a chair and the owner was laying on the chairs with his feet up on the table, in the dining room, on the phone and told us they're closed until 5 PM. nI can't say anything about their food but I can say their service is atrocious. Good luck to those who come here in the future, I hope they clean the tables for their guests sake.",1
"I'm moved to write a limerick instead of a haiku.this time n n We stopped at the Jungle at lunchtime, The Hummus and Schwarma were both fine, The food is all scrumptious, The service is bumptious, All in all, though, we had a good time I just noticed that I wrote an entire limerick without a single reference to Nantucket.a first for me A solid 4 stars ",2
"This place is an internet scam! The description from the ABVI site is misleading, avoid this place at all cost. Simply put, it looks like crack house, and it's not in a safe location. If your lucky you might see local meth addicts fighting crackheads. And the hotel management is has level of scumminess that is equally matched by the criminal patrons of this hotel.",1
"Oh, Chuy's, as a transplanted Texan, how I have missed you! I'm willing to drive the hour from Winston Salem to eat here. Queso that isn't watery white slop, enchiladas the way they're supposed to be, light delicious chips, oh and the margaritas! And the decor is even better than other locations I've been to. But still over the top and delightfully tacky fun. We'll keep coming back!",2
"Love Delaney's. Impecable service. We always go there on special occaisons and are never dissapointed. The food and service is top notch. Not many places left that have the level of service and the quality of food they have. The onion rings are a necessity when we visit. Keep it up Delaney's, you are my favorite steak house.",2
"Primantis. A place you go when your out of town guests request that you take them there. Then you spend the remaining time explaining to them that actual great food does exist in the burgh. Still, if it's late and you are trying to soak up the excess of your evening with a bit of French fry grease, this is your place. ",1
"The best way to enjoy this experience is to go with several people and opt for the all you can eat special. Our group was able to sample dozens of different items and were well satisfied by the end of the meal. nMy favorites were the hand rolls, scallops with yuzu, soft shell crab and tuna, calamari and lychee sherbet. It turned out to be a very good deal for the amount we ate.",2
"Very nice pool. Visually, the pool area is gorgeous. And there's plenty of chairs. Absolutely loves the pool. The service was fantastic as well. The pool area was very clean and I noticed that they cleaned up after people very quickly after they left to make room for more people. Definitely a gorgeous pool to visit!",2
"This is a review of the restaurant setting. I walked in after lunch, about 1 00 PM on a Friday. Dirty tables everywhere, birds flying in and out, all around the place and some settling down on dirty tables inside the restaurant having a feast of their own. The staff didn't seem to be concerned, well it did me. I adios right out of there. You gotta be KIDDIN!",1
"I was in a hurry 2 weeks ago, in between Business appointments in the Valley view area, and I stopped in because of convenience. And I am Glad I did. What a Pleasant surprise! Wonderful menu choices and Good Prices! for a Lunch time Rush, the service was friendly and quick! Located in a Commercial Business Strip nbut well worth the stop! They also have availability to host events after hours.",2
"Save your and find another restaurant because you are only paying for the lovely view. I had the 36 salmon which was overcooked, dry mush surrounded by a florescent green runny liquid. Very unappetizing. Limited menu, mostly for meat eaters, way overpriced, under construction inside and very disappointing.",1
This place was neat! Wait staff was friendly and attentive. We ordered cheese curds and the crab and spinach dip for appetizers. Both were delicious. I had the special of the night for dinner which was some salmon burger and it was AMAZING! That's salmon burger will get me going back there again and again.,2
I decided to refinance my home. I was told that my documents would be emailed to me. The email never arrived OfficeMax kept my documents for 2 days. someone took the information from those documents and decided to write checks against my account now I'm dealing with identity theft. I have never had issues with officemax and I have been going there for years but I must warn others please stay away.,1
Horrible food no flavor I went with my boyfriend he had gotten the boneless buffalo chicken wings and I got the shrimp and chicken pasta and we shared the Mac and cheese appetizer bites he had a couple of bites of my food and on the way home I started feeling sick when we got home he felt the same way and turns out he's got food poising I wouldn't go here again!,1
Just signed another lease .Grace and Nancy are always so very helpful.The maintenance staff is wonderful and responds rapidly in the rare case of need.Response times are fabulous and the work is very neatly done.My MAC lipstick with free shipping did not melt because my package was held in the office.,2
"Went here to order some late night breakfast. Can't f g believe they charge extra to sub out cottage cheese for hash browns. I've traveled all over the country, and this is the first place I have had that does this. When you travel a lot, it's the little things that matter. I travel a lot, and while I can afford it, it's the spirit of the charge that befuddles me.",1
I went to Burlands to redesign my fiance's mom' s ring into my engagement ring. From the moment I met Jan I knew I was in great hands. Burlands provided me the creativity to update the ring within an amazing time frame and it was extremely reasonable! I will never go anywhere else! My fianc u00e9 and I were thrilled at the outcome as was my future mom! Thank you Burlands!,2
The ideal breakfast place. Quality no nonsense breakfast food. The owner Carol and her staff make every customer feel like family. All the items on the menu are solid but I prefer the Amanda burrito with chorizo. For lunch they serve great soup and sandwich combinations. Try the potato cream cheese soup it's awesome.,2
"LA Fitness bought Pure Fitness and closed down my gym at Elliot and Alma School. Their recommendation ? Go to LA Fitness at Warner and Dobson. My impression on visiting there, which also led to my cancellation of membership was Parking very crowded, Gym over crowded, no access to cardio equipment waited more then 15 minutes due to overcrowding. No way, not with me!",1
This used to be a decent hotel. I will never stay here again! The customer service is terrible and the manager didn't have any better customer service. The rooms are outdated and if you want an updated room it cost extra. Why not just update all the rooms?! This place is turning into Circus Circus. trashy.,1
The employees at Southwest are self righteous jerks. Especially Iesha at the counter gate B2. nReally no seating and overbooking? Sent me to Vegas KNOWING all flights Id need were booked for the next 8 hrs! Totally NOT a problem to send me and my 2 children to a city that we'd be stuck in for 8hrs. nLAME,1
Everything about this place speak to me as a local neighborhood bar with defined taste. As a random dweller of bars pubs i always enjoy the setting of this venue it blends in the neighborhood perfectly with its own charm. As a big plus theres an ice cream shop connecting to the restaurant bar. Definitely recommend to other friends when in town.,2
I've been to this place twice with my wife and we really like their doughnuts and coffee. None of the doughnuts I've had here so far have been overly sweet. I never know what to order because all of their doughnuts look and taste great. They offer a vegan selection of doughnuts as well. I am lactose intolerant so it's nice that they have the choice of soy milk.,2
"This restaurant literally was a deciding factor when my husband and I purchased a house in the adjacent neighborhood. The staff are so friendly, and the food is so delicious. It's our favorite place. This location is completely separate from other Thai Ramas in the valley way better than the one in Tempe. Try the angel wings and yellow curry!",2
"This place lives up to it's hype. I had the waffles w thick cut bacon and hash browns, the flavors discovered my lost taste buds. The bacon has this special seasoning that goes nicely on it. One of the best hash browns I ever had. Long wait but worth it, the waiters are average they all work together which they try very hard to speed things up. 4.5.",2
"I love mexican and thought I'd give this place a try. Horrible. The ONLY good thing was the salsa. The 'tableside' guac obviously from a bag, and not made tableside. Dinner was no better than taco bell. Bland food, stale veggies for ingredients. Even though it was cheap, it wasn't worth 1 2 the price. Save your time, go elsewhere.",1
"This is a fantastic little bar restaurant. I love any place that has good food and a real bar. Wings very very good Gyros Super deal, and super tasty, 5 for Gyro and Fries! Other Greek food Amazing Desserts Yum! This is the perfect spot to have lunch if you are in South Tempe. I have a hard time not stopping here when I go to Lowes on Baseline and Rural.",2
"I used to love the pad thai here, but a place in LA forget the name! has beat is out of the water.theirs in still pretty good though. Their chicken satay is still my fav though.moist and flavorful. And the the peanut dipping sauce is tasty too of course. The service is great here and they packaged all of our leftovers up for us.",2
I have been to a Famous Dave's on the east coast a couple of times in the past and not been impressed. But a friend talked me into going to this one and I was very impressed. I have to say the ribs were superb considering it is a chain. Much above expectations and the service was also great. I will certainly pay them a visit next time I'm in Vegas.,2
"I love Costco. Buying products at a cheaper price in bulk is a great model for larger families. The cafeteria is also great for cheap eats, don't eveeed to be a member! I only regret that the video game section has gone down the drain. What used to provide competitive console bundles and mainstream titles has dwindled down to maybe two games no one has ever heard of. Damn shame if you ask me.",2
"Overall, It's a dive, but inexpensive and the kids had fun on the rides and playing games. We had a smoke free room but it still smelled like smoke. Rooms are low end looking. Plumbing was awful. I would probably pay a few extra bucks and stay some place else and if you have kids, swing by for a few hours to hit the rides and games.",1
"I am going to write two reviews for dinner here. First thing of the hostesses, named heather and jennifer. Walked in and had to literally clear my throat to get them to look up from texting. They told me the wait time and gave me a pager. Watching them interact with other guests was painful. They continually were ignoring guests, laughing loudly and texting. Horrible customer service.",1
"As a loyal Terrible customer, I hesitate to write this review, but I got over it. nI stopped by this store to get a quick oil change. Here's what I got in addition to the service. They left my glove box on the floor of the car after checking the cabin air filter. n. n They failed to reset the maintenance schedule warning. The manager was actually surly when processing my bill. Never again!",1
"Horrendous service! Took over 25 minutes to get one shake and one scoop of ice cream! No ""sorry for the wait "". Just dirty looks. It took three completely incompetent people to refill the soft serve machine! The bathroom was 'closed' because the floor was flooded. It was nasty! The ice cream and shake we're delicious but they have no control over that because they don't make it! Won't be back!",1
"I went to Crust last night and was very disappointed. I ordered the medium crust pizza with spinach as a topping. The pizza arrived lukewarm, and the spinach had a bitter taste. The service was friendly and the ambiance was OK, but I think that Joe's Pizza in downtown Scottsdale has a much better Sicilian stye of pizza for a much lower price. I will not be returning to Crust.",1
"I called to place an order for a pepperoni sausage pizza. I was told ""we don't have that. "" I asked how that is possible I was told they only have that kind of pizza if ordered on line not over the phone. Seriously? Like a sucker I went on line ordered the pizza. When it arrived, the crust was quite doughy extremely soggy undercooked! Yuck, yuck yuck! I will not be returning. Save your money!",1
I cao longer support this safeway. The manager I think? middle eastern guy in his 30s? scolds at his employees in public. I don't know if they deserve it or not but pleAse keep it behind doors! A customer should not have to hear it. Also saw people protest near the store against this particular safeway because of how they treat employees apparently not so well .,1
"I'm from Mpls we have 2 Kincaid's here locally and both are equally delish. I was not at all impressed with the Phoenix location. We were there on a Sunday night after the Sun game started, had 6 in our party. There was one other group in there. Even for a Sunday I excepted more. I would not go back there I'll save my trips to Kincaid's for home and not vaca.",1
"First, this theater has great sound. I guess I had been going to older theaters and didn't realize what I was missing. Another bonus is that they accept the harkins refill cups at this location. Great way to save money. Great location, usually not completly full for most movies, and a great selection of movies. Haven't tried their Imax screen yet but have heard it is nice.",2
"I've been here twice first time we had poor service with dry cupcakes, second time we had the same with a different cupcake girl and I told myself never again! Today at a get together these were brought and once I tasted the dry cupcake and funky icing I knew it was from this place. Yep! I was right. 3rd times the charm for a review. Just nasty ",1
"Had the seared scallops with black eyed pea succotash, bacon and creamed corn.it was delish! A tad salty as you would expect from such a savory dish, but I would totally have it again. Service was great too.we alerted our server we sat at the bar that we were in a hurry to see a show, and he stayed on top of it.",2
Stopped by Mesa Arizona for a concert and stopped in for bfast. Absolutely delicious breakfast. The chili and cheese hashbrowns with egg were amazing. Finally a breakfast item that made me say wow. So glad we braved the heat to drive over here for a quick stops. Well worth it and one of the few places that live up to their Yelp hype.,2
"Extremely disappointed. Been coming here for years. Last night, I ordered the catfish on special. Since they burned the fish the last time I got it to go, I asked them to cook it light brown. They send it out RAW. There were no apologies and nothing done to make it right. Last night, they lost a regular customer!",1
"This food truck has it going on. nI am a huge burger fan and these are top notch! I ordered the Black and Blue burger and it was amazing. The balance of flavors, the juicy patty, smoked bacon and fresh baked bun can't be beaten. nThey also have fresh lemonade, I had the mango, and it was phenomenal! If claim to be a burger fan, your list is not complete until you try these!",2
"This place doesn't even deserve a star rating. Dec 29th they came to ""fix "" our fridge. 350 later, one month later, 10 no shows, and being hung up on when inquiring on appoint to honor their ""guarantee service "" and I have fridge that is worse off then when I started. Do not conduct business with this company unless you want to spin your wheels and waste your time and money.",1
"So finally, I have decided to review LAX. I went here on a couple of times years ago and I still remember the not so fun times at LAX. The line is ridiculoussss. And the dance floor and layout of the place is way too small. There are a crap load of tables, but no place to do any dancing or wandering. All in all, a very narrow and poorly designed venue that really takes away from the possible fun.",1
Stay away from this place. We got bottle service for a friend's bachelor party and they switched the table we booked for an inferior one and we had to pay an extra 1k. They were acting extremely dishonest the wheel time. Avoid this host Kevin and his underling Josh. The night afterwards was OK but I have had much better experiences at marquee and XS. Will not be coming back period.,1
My best friend and I were going to Vegas for her bday and she's never been before. She really wanted to go see Holly Madison because of her show and I said I would go along. I like Holly but she cannot dance. I thought the story line was stupid. I don't particularly like seeing topless girls. But the dancing was really nice and I enjoyed the music.,1
"Someburros is an excellent fast, great quality Mexican food. It could honestly make the cut for a food network show for fast food,fast service delicious Mexican with that blonde spiked hair dude, Guy. Try the pollo shredded beef fundido or the classic tacos. Mmmm. The hot sauce is not for the faint heart, it's awesome.",2
The oho was great. My one criteria for good pho is the soup. A second criteria is the quality of hte meat and on both counts they came up 4 stars. The egg rolls were also great. The Vietnamese coffee however was not drip coffee and came without the condensed milk. Overall still worth a visit when in Vegas.,2
" cough, cough sorry, i'm still coughing from all the cigarette smoke. ugh.smoking in the sirport. can't they make a room for the smokers like they do in every other aiport in the country? and slot machines.people, if you are gambling in the airport, then i'd put my money that you have a gambling problem. pun intended. points for being so close to the strip though.",1
"We were out on the west side and used Yelp to find somewhere for lunch. Glad we stumbled on this hidden gem. We ordered the Chicken Satay, the Red Curry with Chicken and Beef Panang. All were delicious. We like things hot but the ""hot "" was just a tad too hot but still very very very good. The service was great and the owner checked on us often. Definitely recommend.",2
"Just about any Brazilian style steak house gets 4 stars form me. On the plus side, the salad bar was amazing. Fish, crab rangoons, squid salad, greek, ceaser, etc. On the minus, the only poultry they brought us was one chicken dish, and no fish dish was provided outside the salad. Expensive, and they do push the drinks pretty hard. Cheesecake at the end was so so.",2
"The price range is deceptive because they serve family style. At first I thought the ""small "" was overpriced until I realized you could feed 3 4 people on one. For a franchise I find the quality decent. The service was great and they also regularly publish generous coupons.which entices us to add an appetizer or dessert. They make the money back.",2
"If you want good Chinese food served in a nice restaurant with good service this is the place to go off the Strip. Try the clay pot dishes, chow fun, Peking duck, scallops in black bean sauce or any seafood dish and you can't go wrong. Service can be inconsistent but the food is ""dynomite. "" Open late for those of use who get the munchies.",2
They have 4 tart flavors right now. I love tart froyo. There are a lot of flavors to choose from. Plus you can put on whatever toppings you want. It's all weighed so I have seen some kids go crazy with the toppings! Ask for some sample cups at the register before you get to the flavors. The cheesecake bits are great and the strawberries too.,2
"It takes forever to get served. It is a chain so the dishes aren't awesome. Seems the sweet crepes are better or at least look better than the savory ones, we did not stick around to find out. The savory crepes though. First of all, they don't taste so good. The crepes are soggy, the chicken is a bit dry and the cream sauce put us in the bathroom for 2 days. So, I would say never again",1
"Eventually, they found the customer who was given my pants by mistake, and I got my pants back. After all the back and forth, I was offered some store credits for future cleaning. So this incident is considered resolved, and I've upped their star counts by one, but I am not exactly running back to claim those credits.",1
"I didnt buy anything here. I personally probably wouldn't because it REEKED so bag like rotten meat, I would be terrified of some type of food mishandling. Yes, the prices are decent. I actually couldnt deal with the scent for more than 2 minutes so I left. I really wanted to like this place. OHH well.",1
"Bad, no pun intended and not bad in a good way. He didn't even try to sound like Michael cuz he had a Latin accent! Come on Rio at least get someone who could somewhat pull this off. It really is not a good show and you're better off going to the Cirque show cuz at least you get to hear some real music there. This is just not s good show.",1
"Good pizza at a reasonable price that's NOT a chain! What more can you ask for? Service is good and the pizza is great. The only downfall is that you have to deal with the Sun City ers which makes visiting the restaurant annoying. Beyond that, the restaurant itself is clean and simply set up and the food is very good.",2
"It wasn't bad, but I've had better Thai food. I ordered Pad Thai and Thai Tea that was brought it to me in a to go box not sure why they assumed it was to go. The flavor was right but the noodles seemed a little soggier thaormal. The portion size was good enough and the spring roll was a nice added bonus. I'll probably stop in again sometime if I'm hungry and nearby.",2
"i was there for a business convention. i was presenting the next day. people partying in the hall at 4a.m. multiple calls to the front desk with no success. had to go to the front desk several times between 4 5am to change rooms to a quiet floor. exhausted the next day during presentation. front desk was unresponsive, unprofessional, and incompetent.",1
"Solid restaurant. Let me preface this by saying that I don't love Las Vegas like some people do. This place is a somewhat welcome respite from the usual craziness which is Las Vegas. The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. That being said, it's not the most authentic French restaurant I've ever been to, but it's Vegas. Definitely worth a meal.",2
"Why are you on YELP reading about this place and NOT eating here? Holy balls, this place is amazzzzzing. I have single handedly converted a small army of people to adoring this place. Really, it's all fab, except for the Buffalo Empanada. The ham and cheese is fabulous, the black bean salad to die for, the fig and cheese empanada my BFF. Plus, BOTH my kids eat whatever the get here. Go here now.",2
"All around great dry cleaners with very friendly staff! We've tried several other dry cleaners in the Anthem area and have found most to be pricey and lacking in quality attention to detail. Thrift D Lux has regular monthly coupons available on their website, which is a nice bonus to help keep costs down. Next day service is nice, too!",2
"I really try to like this place because it is close to home and my friends like to go play pool and have a few beers here, but the food is just awful. I've had about 6 different things I've really tried to find something decent , but I just haven't liked anything except the french fries. Go here to get a few drinks, but as far as food goes.go somewhere else.",1
"Do not bother! I called on a Thursday to schedule a party of 6 I was told no problem , no reservations needed, when we arrived on Sunday we were turned away they stated a bigger party has booked the facility and too bad bad attitude and no apologies we will never go back went to Pole Position around the corner and had a great time!",1
"I'm a Juicy Bitch so of course i had to check out the store while i was in Vegas. The girls in the store were very helpful and nice. The store was laid out nicely and had a nice selection in everything from clothes, jewelry LOTS AND LOTS of charms and even kids and baby stuff. Not as many purses as i would expect but regardless i was still in heaven. Go Juicy!",2
I had bookmarked to try this bar but rarely am around this location. I just happened to see it while riding my motorcycle today and stopped in for a couple beers. I wound up playing some video poker and watched the UNLV game. The bartender and Hammer seemed like nice people. Hammer is a Bears fan so I will be back to watch some football when season starts.,2
"What's not to Love. This company is a trend setter we feel blessed to have them in our town! The Quality. The training they give employees. The whole experience is extraordinary. We love when they have the big stems of Brussell sprouts. Also, the way they grade their grass fed beef. There is not a better quality if burger meat around. Such a great place!",2
After waiting over an hour at the airport for the shuttle to arrive alongside other guests the shuttle finally arrived. When I got to the hotel I walked in the doors and immediately knew I made a mistake. There is a smell in the lobby that makes you want to shower instantly. It only gets worse when you finally make it to your room. Spend the extra 20.00 to stay somewhere else!,1
What happened to the foooood it sucks did they get a new cook oh my god that was aweful worst omelet I've ever had how do you screw up a omelet. The waitress was good food was nasty and the coffee tasted like nasty instant I had so many grounds in my coffee I could of brewed another pot come on guys I'm so disappointed,1
"The taste is authentic. Really like the pork chops and ribs. Not expecting any service whenever going to an authentic Chinese restaurant. It's just that the menu only had a few items. They had more items on the Asian menu which I couldn't read so that wasn't helpful. Basically, no service with little choice on the menu. I would do take out instead next time.",1
Sooooo happy I waited to fix my hair from Hawaii to Vegas! . MAYRA is seriously a hair genious. She took my super orange messed up ombre and did EXACTLY what I wanted. She's bomb! I've been folowing this salon and Mayra on Instagram for a while and they totally know what they're doing. Definitely hit up this salon if you're in Vegas. Location isn't that great but this place is a gem.,2
"I was with my gilfriend, we came on Monday around 9pm. Pretty much most of the restaurants nearby were closed, so kudos to this place. nThe deco is great, quite unusually beautiful for an indian restaurant. Service was fast and friendly. We had a jaifrazi and khaima not sure , and boy it was quite spicy the waiter told us ! nOverall great place.",2
So I've been waiting 40 minutes for my oil change and went to see where my vehicle was. I found it right where I had parked it and also saw 2 open service bays. Waiting area is cramped but at least they have water. Also they have a really nice Samsung TV for ntheir advertising but a small cheap quality TV for waiting area. They're directtv also wasn't working so time just slowed down.,1
"We made an appointment with one of their events people, Danny, to check out this place as a potential wedding venue. Saturday morning 9 a.m. nWe showed up, he wasn't there. We waited 20 minutes. He never showed, never called. We waited a couple weeks, never heard from him or from anyone Doubletree. So . that's pretty rude and disorganized. Blah.",1
"The place is small but it's clean, the service is quick and friendly and the food was yummy! We tried the sisig, the pancit bihon and the lumpiang shanghai. All were well priced and very good. The sisig was not as good as the one I used to have as a little kid in pampanga but it was pretty darn good! Definitely worth coming back again!",2
"I know Donatos is a chain, but I continue to be impressed by this particular location on Park Road. Located next to Ed's Tavern, they have great specials. 8.99 bakery style pizza with 3 toppings. Think pan style pizza. 16 square slices for 9?! Awesome. For take out, expect 15 min and delivery 30 min. That's for Southend area. Staff is friendly too.",2
"My least favorite sushi experience in a long time . . .I've had better from the grocery store in those plastic boxes. Took an employee on their recommendation. I guess it's quite different at happy hour and the evening. Very nice surroundings down to the fish swimming in the floor. That day it must have been a ""two fer "" Sushi and attitude all for the price of the sushi. Rachel T. sums it up well!",1
"I moved to Las Vegas a year ago and wanted to find a bar that was fun, great drinks and a place to enjoy a night out, ""THIS IS IT "" it's all you could ask for a mixed group of people, fun bartenders and great prices drinks. If your looking to avoid the 15 strip drinks and get that are better and lower in price don't miss this gem",2
Very comfortable hotel. The front desk staff is always so nice. I have hosted several meetings here and the complete experience has always been favorable. From in room dining to restaurant options you will not go hungry. nWalking distance to many great places through out downtown Charlotte. nI always sleep like a a baby.,2
"Love another farmers market here in Lovely Las Vegas! This market is a mix of goods local produce being sold. Very nice to see locals out pushing their stuff, BUY LOCAL! nThe bath stuff is really nice by the way. noff to take a soak! also do not miss the Elixir Organic cafe in the same strip mall. All Organic, All good! ",2
"Let me atart by saying that this is my first review on yelp and i just had to do it! First of all and most importantly my server JESUS is the best server ever! And the reason why iam writting this. Thank you jesus, you are the best! Food was really good and on time. Would i go back? Of course as long as jesus is still working there ",2
They made me answer 20 different security questions because my debit card is lost. Even though I answered all the questions correctly they still made me call corporate to get an approval. I've spent almost 45 minutes with two children simply trying to make a non complicated withdrawal from my account. I shouldn't have to fight this hard for my money.,1
"Stopped at this location on my way home from work. Ordered my food, which included a large coleslaw side. Almost home, I realized I didnt get it. When I went back, the cashier had attitude, didnt offer an apology or anything else for my trouble coming back. I was shocked at how small the large side is for the 3.89 price! ! Wow! Always check your bags before leaving! Won't stop here again! !",1
"Food is good but service is terrible, we are party of two and we get only one napkin cuz they don't have to many, only a few left, really?, they prepare the food the way they wanted no the way I want like the guacamole outside the burrito not inside like I want, plus they cover the outside with guacamole, bad experience",1
"Who'd a thunk it to find a great Mexican spot inside a gas station? But it was pretty legit for where it was. And the ONE guy working the place was very friendly, FAST, and made yummy grub! Their salsa was very tasty and you could tell it wasn't the canned or bottled crap. They had a pretty wide selection of food, very impressed!",2
"Nice restaurant and bar, Thai is their specialty. Service was fast and friendly. Booth seating available. Well stocked bar, surprisingly good wine selection in all price ranges. nI had the lunch special. Yellow curry chicken. Flavors were great. I enjoyed my meal. nAgain my experience was for lunch. So for a tasty lunch, good price, and quick they came thru.",2
"Hands down the best middle eastern restaurant in the Tempe area. You can't beat the prices, everything is always consistently good we go here about once a week . Favorites nHummus and Gyro Delux! Don't forget to grab some baklava too, this is the best i've ever had and that includes having some while in the middle east ",2
"It's only ok for me. I've had better beers and better food. People look at this place as a Madison staple, but if you are going to go, I would only go fro drinks. The food is fine if you go in with low expectations, it's just nothing special and there are plenty of better dining options that are a short walk from this place.",1
"Thank you for the diarrhea Don Tortacos! Basically, we came here after JF and I ordered the carne asada fries. The price was the same as everywhere and the actually plate wasnt lovely nor was it delectable. I hate the carne asada here! It was over cooked and no bueno! Customer service was decent, and they have a little salsa bar. The next morning I wanted to die. It was horrid. No Mas Tortacos!",1
"WOW! This is as good as it gets! The real deal Thai food in Phoenix! Everything is made fresh when ordered and delicious. Plan ahead, give yourself some time to get ordered and served since this is not a fast food Thai restaurant. This is an amazing eating experience, it borderlines a religious experience and it should not be rushed. If you are a true Thai connoisseur, this is your place.",2
I really love the Sweet Factory! They have the yummiest original cocktails sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. Me and my friend went here for Happy Hour and they have super killer deals. We had the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was deelish! Our serer was super sweet no pun intended and helpful with helping us choose drinks and food.,2
"Went there the other day for all you can eat sushi for lunch and I must say I was impressed. I quite enjoyed the appetizers tuna poki, Brie and grape quesadilla, tuna capaccio, sashimi roll wrapped in daikon, and of course the sushi was good. When I come back to vegas I will definitely stop by here again and you should too!",2
"This place is great. Renee is an excellent bartender and the chef puts out a good plate of food every time. For the past reviews slamming the decor, it is a bar, so know that when you walk in. But it still has great food and friendly service. One thing. the karaoke on Thursday needs to go. Thursday night football trumps karaoke.",2
Came in here after our dinner at Bask and thank God because Mike was great! He wasnt very busy but he let us vent about what a D bag the owner over at Bask was and he just listened to us and probably thought we were crazy but he was super nice and because of him we ended our night off way better! I will be back and hopefully take advantage of the very large patio!,2
"I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Can't beat the price, quick walk to the strip, and SMOKE FREE! I can't tell you how much of a difference it makes to stay in a smoke free resort, wow! Room was spotless, amazing bed, robes, and great bathroom. 24 hr Starbucks in Lobby. Front desk staff was very polite and professional. Great rates as well, like I said I would stay again!",2
"Don's Waste Your Money! Before going to the Pro Bull Riders event at Jobing.com we stopped here to eat dinner. They had an ""Event Menu "" which seemed different than the menu I saw on their website and more expensive. The food was awful, barely warm and poorly presented. How they can charge what they do is beyond me. The service was fair. There has to be better choices for dinner at Westgate.",1
"This buffet is just your standard buffet. There is nothing special about it, only eat here if you can get it for free with your Harrah's total rewards points. One particularly annoying thing besides the food being not that great is that they put the desserts on these big round plates so you can't hold more than a couple at a time. So dumb.",1
Arrived for Sunday brunch at 2 45pm and grabbed all the brunch items I could before they switched over to dinner around 3 15pm! SCORE. Brunch and dinner all for the price of Sunday brunch which was 31.95. It was such a good deal and definitely good planning. The main difference between brunch and dinner is that the crab legs come out at dinnertime! YUMMMMM,2
"Beware of vaccuming going on in the room next door at 2 in the morning. Then to top it off the desk manager, Evan Rose asked us ""what the problem with that was? "" Oh come on it woke us up! Why would you treat a guest like that? Loud, dirty, unfriendly staff. So sad because this kitschy hotel chain could really be something fun if they would get out of their own way.",1
This place is nice and the service is damn good. The rooms are plush and the bathrooms are spacious. The place smells good and seems very clean. My one and only complaint is you can't get a cab from tower 3 and WTF is up with the walk to the MGM. When yo have been drinking all day and night it is a beast of a walk back to the room.,2
"We saw three shows this week and this was the best of them all. Good mixture of adult humour and musical numbers by a numbers of big female stars. All the week known stars were represented, Minnelli, Cher, Jackson, better middler, Tina turner, and many more. The boys all performed like they really are women. Great set of male dancers. Well worth the entry price.",2
"Pretty disappointed after reading the reviews. The Tortelli was too buttery sweet and was served cold in the center. The flatbread was below average tasted like a bake at home pizza from your local grocery store. Much like all restaurants in Vegas, quite expensive, but the food wasn't even tasty. Definitely not worth the time money.",1
"Stopped in today for my first haircut after moving back to Arizona from California. Oz was the barber in the shop and he has been there cutting hair for over 10 years. Nice guy and he did an excellent job. I would definitely go back. His shop is a real neighborhood shop and not one of the fancy franchise places. Felt comfortable, professional and he made me feel at home.",2
"I always find it hard to find decent breakfast places. I recently had a business meeting at Cracker Barrel and was happy with y experience. They have a large breakfast menu so there is something for everyone. Their little store also has some unique gifts, which are perfect for stocking stuffers. Bring a big appetite for here!",2
Ok truth is this really a restaurant that doubles for a place that makes beer. Beer is not that great.Come here because I am loyal to Craft Works brands. Our bartender Chris is fantastic. He us funny energetic and works his tail off behind the bar . Makes it work coming here. Be sure to Ask for him as he is a server as well,2
"I originally thought this place would be a great weekend hangout. Went once and it was pretty good, went again and we sat for 15 minutes being ignored by multiple staff while they meandered around straightening table cloths and chatting. We tried to get their attention to no avail. We gave up and went somewhere else.",1
"Tait has serviced our 2000 Vtec Accord 2.3L for 1 year now, providing the best service experience I've had in my 31 years of living! Thanks Hon Man. nI am now selling my Jeep Cherokee in pursuit of another Honda, as well as encouraging all of my friends to buy Honda, and look up Tait Johnson, HonMan. And his logo is spot on!",2
"The selection of stores is just okay. However the layout is not good. For most people accessing both sides for the stores or theatre they will find that they prefer to move their vehicle than cross to the furthest side by foot through a massive parking lot. If you are unfortunately one who arrives by public transportation, then you are just up the creek in a hot asphalt parking lot.",1
"Wow! What a difference from their old location! Great staff, very friendly and helpful. I have seen only one doctor but she has been great in helping me fix my sons eyes. They have complimentary Keurig coffee and a tiny nook that is supposed to be a play area but is not impressive. There are a few books and a tiny train table but it is better theothing!",2
"B B Pools will beat any price you see at Leslie's hands down, and if you ever need any repair work done on pool equipment, you'll be looking at savings of anywhere from fifty to seventy percent from what Leslie's will quote you for parts and repairs. All of the employees here are helpful and knowledgeable. It's great to be able to support a local business while getting the best deal in town.",2
"My second dinner here tonight. The room reminds you of a set in the movies. Started the evening with a great tequila cocktail. The menu is on the chalk board along with few specials. The chicken in the pot is the best dish I've had both times. Nothing will disappoint you. Great service, wine and food.",2
"My husband and I stopped by this morning to try their breakfast special. We had sausage, egg, and chedddar cheese on a croissant. The croissant was flaky. It was scrumptious and filling. They were very nice and let me substitute a jasmine green tea for coffee. My mini brownie was delicious We will definitely go back again.",2
I have never waited less then 45 minutes when I go to see my gynecologist. The front desk staff is very cold and unwelcoming. I always have trouble reaching my doctor on the telephone and never get prompt return calls. The lobby area to wait to be called is always so packed sometimes there aren't even enough chairs. Save yourself a huge headache and your time and go somewhere else !,1
"The food is okay, but evidently the management cares nothing about the comfort of their patrons. In summer, it is blazing hot inside. In winter, better bring a blanket. When all your customers are eating with their heavy winter coats on, maybe you can get a clue? Not a transient problem, it's been this way since the place opened. I won't be back.",1
"Visited Charlotte last weekend and read that Nolens' was the place for Brunch. I went there and was disappointed. the only thing that was great were the prices and service. nThe brunch was ok, my husband had to send his omelet back because it was too salty, it came back better. nI would day it you must eat something and its the closest thing, why not. nbut go somewhere else.",1
"It seems that many folks complain about the service. I have been there recently and the place was good. The sandwich were very . well . greasy but this is what you expect when you go in this type of place, right? The beer selection is good with a lot of local selection. On my part, the service was good and on time. Will definitively come back, way better than many other places in that area.",2
The people who work here are not qualified at all. Had to repeat my pick up order multiple times and the food ended up being wrong. Called them to fix it and again had to repeat the order many times. Got frustrated and asked for a manager. The manager too did not know how to take an order. I don't understand why it was so hard.,1
"This is an OK Italian restaurant in NDG. I It's casual, and laid back with a fun atmosphere.There menu is extensive, but they seem to have a compact daily specials section which is nice. I stuck to the daily specials and ordered a shellfish pasta dish. It was quite tasty, but nothing remarkable. As as plus, the portions here are HUGE. You get great value for the price.",1
"If you are looking for the freshest YUM in the world, you have found it here! Everything is made to order, using nothing but the best ingredients. Our teenage boys, who eat nothing, would live at Crepe Expectations and eat crepes all day if I'd let them. The dessert crepes are to die for! I dare you to eat just one! Keep up the good work!",2
"When I want a quiet lunch after church and I do not have the means to trek elsewhere for thai food, I come here. If you are on the north quad, the journey I don't think is worth it. Their service is quick and relatively inexpensive. However, there are better sit down thai restaurants in town. They have a ""free meal deal "" if you use cash for 10 meals and the 11th is free.",1
Steph and Amanda are both AMAZING at what they do. I've never had my nails done as artistically and beautiful as Stephanie does them and Amanda is an amazing hair stylist. I will never go anywhere else in Pittsburgh! Reasonably priced and the best quality and caring u won't find anywhere else! Love u guys!,2
"Luncha Libre catered an event we attended last week. We had an exciting combo of tacos from Thai Style, Steak Gorgonzola to Bacon shrimp. All were amazing we couldn't agree on a group favorite because they were all so unique and so darned good. Friendly staff, great food, and worth tracking down. Am looking for an excuse to have them cater an event at our place next!",2
"Love this shopping mall.its high class but when you want quality, I shop here for all the store I want to go to are here. I love going on the spiral escalator. Views from above are so nice. There are comfy benches everywhere for the hubby or bf to sit at while waiting for you. I go here every time I visit Vegas! ",2
"As a hole in the wall restaurant, this place offers some of the best food in the valley, great pricing, and great flavor! If your a fan of Spicy try ordering your food ""Thai Hot "" but be sure to get some green tea ice cream afterwards because your mouth WILL be burning! Over all amazing experience, the food is incredible, drunkeoodles, or garlic noodles are a must.",2
"This is the MOST DISGUSTING hotel ever. Only plus, no signs of bed bugs. The plumbling was backing up in our bathroom sink, and the bathroom always smelled like someone just took a dump. Dirt like residue was feces This hotel is a total health hazard and should be shut down by the department of health. A homeless shelter is cleaner than this hotel.",1
"Been here 5 times and I can say that the food is either a hit or miss. This time around I ordered the ""Com Dac Biet "", which consists of a pork chop, shredded pork skin, quiche, egg and egg roll. What I wasn't expecting was a burnt dried quiche, a small hair presumably head hair and another ahem hair. I will not be coming back.",1
"My husband and I visit Zoe's a lot. The salmon kabobs are really good and I love the Greek salad that comes with it. The hummus is pretty good as well. My husband really likes the Orzo ""Tabbouleh "" Salad. It's definitely popular with families and can be extremely busy during peak hours. The service is usually fast and friendly.",2
"I was very surprised to call and ask a person if I could get an email with the pricing for this dry cleaner. The lady that answered was nice but new and asked the owner that was by her the question and he said to her in the rudest voice I have ever heard, ""JUST TELL HIM NO "". Unbelievable. I spend about 200 per month on dry cleaning.",1
"Had a Caked cupcake via the Sugar Factory on the Strip. Amazing! There were a variety of cupcakes to choose from, yet I chose what I thought was the boring vanilla vanilla. Once I took a bite I was reassured that I had chosen the right combination! The cupcake was fantastic! Next time I'm in Vegas I'm making a special trip out to their bakery.the casinos have nothing on Caked!",2
"Nice airport with free Wi FI and some very good restaurants. Relatively easy to navigate and non smoking. As ""Justin A "" pointed out in his review, they have charging centers for your electronics which I love. My cell phone battery just doesn't last as long as it used to. I also was surprised to see that each bathroom has an attendant with mints and mouthwash and the bathrooms are always clean.",2
"We went there today and swear will never go again. Poor customer service, coffee was served cold . We reached there at 11 and got our table at 12 20. food didnt arrive till 12 40. my son who is 17 mnths old was too cranky by the time we got food. not recommended if you have a small kid. Wait is painful, food is average. I think iHop is far better than this place. Disappointed",1
People are nice to get you signed up. The equipment is ok. The general atmosphere is for people who want to maintain and not get healthier and not get stronger. The locker room is small. The wet area is gross. Did a free day to try it out and did not like at all. Got myself a golds membership for less money and more free weights. Perfect place to do cardio and nothing else.,1
"It's not true one reviewer said there's no bad seats in the house. Try sitting for the entire show in the nose bleed section on the top level. We went for the Andrea Bocelli show on Dec 7th and bought those seats because someone wrote on yelp there's no bad seats in the house! Big mistake! Pay a little more to get better seats, it's worth it.",1
"This is my second times here. They have a variety of breads and pastries. Every time I came in, I just couldn't make a decision since I would like to buy all their pastries lol. I have tried their spicy pork turnover and that was amazing! It's flavorful! I would definitely recommend their turnover to everybody!",2
"The food tasted as good as it looks on the menu. We had oxtail pho, fresh oyster, garlic noodles with crabs, pork belly buns, and oxtail loco moco special. Everything was on point. Must try the pho and pork belly buns! Service was excellent and the atmosphere was great. A nice break from Vegas strip food.",2
"I went to Port of Subs for breakfast thinking it would be a good meal. First of all, their eggs are heavily manufactured. They put their ""yoke "" in a microwave and surprisingly something that looks like eggs came out. They barely put any lettuce on my sandwich and the cheddar cheese didn't taste too much like cheddar. The service wasn't all that great either.",1
A perfect stop on the strip to stop in for a drink. You don't need to go in through the hotel to get in. It is an open air venue so you get a lot of fresh air. We ordered two Margaritas and the bartenders talked us into a pitcher twist our arms . The 'ritas were quite tasty. The bartender takes great photos as well!,2
"If I can give negative star on rating, sure I will do that. Bad services, waiters waitress just group together chi chat and play glambling, and rarely response customer's order. We order special Pho, 9 for a small bowl, and we taste the soup had a lot of MSG! no beef taste, the worst pho I ever ate. Their only advantage is open 24 hours.",1
"The service was exceptional. nThe food was okay, nothing special. It is pricey. nGood decor and ambiance. We had the lunch specials which came with a vegetarian dumpling and small salad with house dressing. Both were good. Our Lunch Specials Drunken Noodle, chicken Good nPineapple fried rice, chicken Good nCashew Chicken Below average",1
"Once the walls start to close in on me while working from my home, This is one of my favorite ""offices "" during a weekday afternoon. It's not too busy or noisy, comfy chairs, you can order half sized meals as a light snack, and the staff is very humble and approachable. I can work here for hours and never feel pressured to buy any more food or drink than I need.",2
"We kinda only went to this because we were given free tickets, and it was for the early show. nWe loved it! We laughed so hard. You never know what is going to happeext. It's stupid funny, knee slapper kinda laugh. nWe only went to the show, so I caot speak about the food. nBut show alone it worth it. nIf I knew what it was going to be like, I would have no prob paying for tickets! nGo see!",2
"Both the cab driver and the hotel recommended Los Olivos, so I was expecting an authentic Mexican dinner. What we got was poorly flavored food and disappointment. All 8 members of my party thought their meals were sub par. However, the bartenders were outstanding! Go for the margaritas as Miguel makes his without mix the way they should be and with fresh lime juice!",1
"The food here used to be great but has gone way downhill in recent months. The music is way too loud. Otherwise it would be a good place to have drinks with friends. As is, it's so loud that I can't really take friends there for a drink after work. It's a real shame because they have an awesome location and a nice patio.",1
Absolutely horrible service. It took 20 min for a waitress to take our drink order 15 min later we had to go to the bar to get our drink. The waitress has yet to clean off the previous customers food off the table or even ask for our order in food! To top it off its not even busy. This is our second time here the first was just as bad. I can say this will be our last time.,1
"Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. Watch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, 9 margarita. Very good though.",2
"Gotta write an update now. Getting a couple of sandwiches to go and then taking them to a nearby plaza for some alfresco dining. Is there any better way to spend your lunch hour on a beautiful spring day? Well a colleague and I did just that, getting a couple of gyros to go. Yeah, Mike Tony's is still a great hole in the wall dive, but really! Where else can you get good cheap gyros this good?",2
"Overpriced for the quality and service. Food was decent, but very small plates, like two bites per plate which would have been fine if the quality was there . Only one plate stood out as excellent Japanese plum wasabi . Was underwhelmed by the service waiter was sloppy and slow. Decor was ok, but nothing exceptional. Honestly, I'm not sure why this place gets so much hype.",1
"What a nice place to stop for a cup of java, tea, or other similar concoction. I love the atmosphere.everyone is on a laptop or iPad. I didn't hear too much conversation except at my table . There were plenty of customers in the establishment yet there were plenty of tables available. A nice spot. I look forward to trying the other location and hope it is as comfortable as University.",2
I stopped in this evening without appt to get a buzz cut and got attitude from girl at desk. She was talking crazy about if multiple guards or scissors are used it would be 42 dollars. I got my haircut a couple weeks ago at the other location without such drama. I won't be back to this location as I don't need the rude tude and wouldn't pay 42 dollars for a simple fade. Get over yourself.,1
It seems like there is not as much value for your dollar at Gold Medal. We had been there since the new school opened but decided to move on. We got a 'can't we get you to stay' call which felt like desperation on their part. My daughter enjoyed her lessons but her favorite teacher left as most do and the cost was not worth it anymore. I would not recommend them to my friends.,1
"Fast greets both at the door and the table. Our server Marion was quick and knowledgeable, which helped us because we were starving and wanted everything on the menu. The coffee braised beef and the spicy pork tacos were our faves! And the street corn.AMAZING. Can't wait to go try more tacos! Loved it.",2
Don't waste your time! I just tried to go here for the 3rd time and there is always a ridiculous wait. They either need to hire a lot more people or allow people to make reservations. This car wash is 25 minutes from me and I will never bother trying to go again. Go to Windy City Car Wash. Great service and you can call ahead to schedule an appointment.,1
Was very disappointed I ordered a ribeye and it was charred on the outside and rare on the inside. Very tough. My wife order was totally wrong she ordered scallops and got chicken Alfredo. Just not worth my money. After i went there makes me think that some of these people that gave great reveiws ate at a different restaurant.,1
"This is my go to spot for brunch in Las Vegas, have been likely over 10 times. Directly across from the bellagio water fountains with patio seating, cappuccino served in a bowl the size of your head, decent prices and pleasant french inspired american brunch food. My recent favorite is the tuna tartare",2
"This place used to be good. I came here last night and ordered the asada burrito and it was all fatty, chewy pieces! By the time I finished I had a pile of meat on my plate that I had to throw away! I was so disappointed. My boyfriend on the other hand had the carnitas burrito which was fine. Never coming here again!",1
I really like coming to this Ross versus the other Ross stores around. Everything is organized and clean. The only complaint is I wish it had a bigger jewelry display like the other stores. Every other store I have been too have huge cases of jewelry but this place is tiny. Oh well! Still love how clean and not cramped it is!,2
"We ate there on Friday night, 5 10 13, one of us ordered meatballs and spagetti, well the meatballs tasted like canned dog food, they had no bread, no seasoning, nothing. nWe have eaten there many times in the past, my husband loves the veal parm. nThey really need to update the menu and learn to cook meatballs, and also the meat sauce leaves a lot to be desired.",1
"I'm a vegetarian, and the vegetarian hibachi sushi combo just fails to impress. Largish portions, at least. For hibachi, I don't know where else to go. For sushi, both Chaya and Umi come immediately to mind. For a large group, it's hard to beat Yokoso, though, as they have tables that will seat groups of 12 24.",1
We love Warehouse 3! Great place for family fun! The owner and staff treat you like family and really listen to what the racers want. They switch up the track often enough to make it interesting. They keep plenty of parts and new cars in stock for all your needs. We found this place a year ago and are so happy we did!,2
Had a really basic UNDERwhelming crepe here. The crepe itself was made badly and it was filled with defrosted soggy old strawberrys. They tried to hide the old fruit with GLOBS of Nutella. Barf. i was really annoyed and threw it away. REALLLY THOUGH. You dont have the decency to have Fresh Strawberrys?,1
"We had dinner here after a play at the Mesa Arts Center. Not the worst but definitely not the best place i've ever eaten. To be fair, I didn't try anything on the wine menu. The gluten free menu was the attraction and i suspect that has attracted a few others as well, especially on a Sunday afternoon wheot much is open in Mesa. It's ok, but I wouldn't go back again.",1
"Can't fault the drink selection but I can fault the prices. I bought a pint of Peroni which fair enough isn't exactly Tennents but u00a34.80 a pint? When I asked if I could have a packet of peanuts to go with my pint they gave me a small tub with the same amount as a normal bag for u00a31.80. Perhaps this isn't too expensive for most people but for me, it is.",1
"Pros n Mesa locatio Mini chimis on menu for about 8 Cons n 20 minute wait for 2 people. it was a Friday night though n Sitting in the bar area, it took awhile to get drinks and menus. n After we sat, it took 20 minutes for our order to be taken and put into the kitchen. I won't be coming back here anytime soon.",1
Opening night! The food was fantastic. Same great pastries and coffee teas as Lux. But now with wine and food. Had a great time. Ambiance is fantastic. There are two work study areas and a large dining area. Service was great. Good selection of beers and wines. Great addition to the coffee shop. Extended hours so for all you night owls it's fantastic. Hope to spend more time here!,2
"ok yes, this place is expensive, but you know all of the new TCBY's of the 21st century are over priced. what i love about queens that makes it different from red mango and its entourage is the taro flavored yogurt. four of us shared a large order with mochi topping. this came to about 8. if you divide that by 4, it's only 2, which is well worth it. ",2
"We just finished the 2014 zombie walk and walked in. No one paid any attention to us as we stood by the please wait to be seated sign for five minutes, so we went and sat on a comfortable couch. We sat there for 35 minutes and no one ever came up and talked yet waitresses walked by us numerous times to us so we left.",1
"After 6 days of road trip with Continental and American breakfast, This place is like a breath of fresh air! The beef noodle soup is bit spicy, noodle is too soft for my taste. But everything else is right on. Normally, I would give it a 3 star but judging from the circumstance and it's Vegas, I gave it a 4.",2
"It is absolutley unacceptable to say an order will be delivered at a certain time and theot even have the courtesy to call and say it will be late. And the solution the manager offered. "" well maybe next time you order we can do something for you "" what a load of crap. Plus the pizza was super greasy. Def not ordering again .",1
"Had three hours to kill before catching plane back to KC and had my nephew and his wife pick a spot close to airport. The Vig was their choice. It was Sunday at 4pm. 3 Margaritas that were great!. I had Posole. Others has Phad Thai and Mac Cheese. Food, service, and atmosphere were very nice. I'd go back!",2
"Came here to buy my boyfriend some casual shirts and jeans. The sales representative who approached me, Gene, was very helpful and nice. Helped me pick out some very nice shirts I wouldn't have otherwise picked out myself. Wasn't pushy in trying to get me to buy other things. Boyfriend loved the clothes and they fit well. Will definitely come back next time he needs some new clothes.",2
"eh. not someplace I would CHOOSE to go to ever again. We tried it out a few times, as it was close to our gallery when we had it. I always expected something great and never got it. Also, the service was never good and they always either messed up Gary's order or brought him out something completely different.",1
"So glad to learn the bar is still here just a shift in ownership! Great events here like live music, karaoke, and even a Comedy night on Mondays! I love the frozen drinks and 1.50 well drinks during the week .can't beat that. Still has a Noda vibe kind of hipster and trendy crowd but not so stuck up.",2
"If anyone is going to the Super Bowl, or the next time you are Scottsdale Phoenix area, make sure you stop by Malee's. It's a ""Thai Bistro Wasabi Room "" and was so good, we went back twice! Make sure you order the tofu spinach pot stickers. This place was full of locals, who always know best. Very fresh, very reasonably priced. There are two locations we hit the one in Old Town on Main.",2
Ok I have to agree with someone else . how are they still open? I items look nothing like they do on the menu and since when is chicken schnitzel GROUND CHICKEN? What is that? The rude chick taking orders needs to be fired. She will hang up on you and also will lie to you about everything . So DO YOURSELF A FAVOR! DO NOT EAT HERE! We are closing our office from being FOOD POISONED!,1
"My favorite items from Einstein's are their Paninis, but this location doesn't serve any! If you like their bagels and beverages you're fine, but I was largely disappointed they did not serve my favorite item. Also be careful at reading the directories when finding this stand, they say it's located in Concourse A, but I found it in B. Get it together McCarren.",1
"I love to listen to AM Radio at night and pick up stations from all over the country, but unless my stereo is grounded properly, I get buzz and engine whine when trying to listen to a traffic report from 300 miles away. The job they did 305 is cosmetic, gives me great reception and was done io time.",2
"Great bar located right inside the mall in front of the entrance to planet Hollywood. What makes this a great bar? The bartenders! Both of them were on it.and they were extremely friendly and funny. Perfect place to grab a drink prior to whatever you're about to do. Haha. 5 shots, 10 long islands, cheap beer. My only complaint? No draft beer.poop.",2
"Cant believe how busy it was on a Wed morning! About a 15 minute wait at 9 40 am. Very nice though, prompt service, freshly squeezed fresh OJ, lots of choice. Food was fresh delicious and served quickly. Approx 9 for each item omelette, burrito, pancakes, eggs benedict . NE corner of Hayden and Via de Ventura. Nice patio with umbrellas and misters.",2
"Super cute, exposed brick walls, garage door opening, I would totally hang out here daily if I lived in the Burgh. The environment is very relaxing and you can set up and get mad work done, chat with friends or read a book. They had good table space and access to outlets which is a huge plus. You can definitely feel the character of the owners in this local love!",2
"It's probably more closely related to the NYC street pretzel than it is to the NYC bagel. My standard bagel test is toasted plain with plain cream cheese. This definitely delivered. The hint of sweetness is just like POW!. awesome. I took one star off for the small size, but I'm kind of a big American dude. For better or for worse, we like larger portion sizes than our friends to the north.",2
"HORRIBLE greasy tempura and flat on one side. the roll was loaded with rice and that's about it. The waitress sat with her friends and talked even tho I needed some attenttion. At the end she thought by calling me ""doll "" that would make up for everything. I could not have been more disappointed and won 't ever do back These guys will never take the place of Blue Wasabi.",1
"Ate there a few weeks back for the first time. My buddy had the hash, which was very greasy and over cooked. The waitress recommended breakfast nachos? Not that good. Chips piled with eggs, cheese sauce and then put under the broiler until it was completely dried out. The nAtmosphere and bar etc was very nice. But, not the food so much. My first and last time.",1
"The food is amazing here! The small bowl is a perfect portion. My favorite is the all chicken one, but I occasionally get the half beef half chicken one. I always order a head of time since it can take a while to prepare the food. But, that does not make this place any less amazing. Also, pour the extra teriyaki sauce and siracha on your meal, you won't regret it!",2
"We loved this place for breakfast! Our Pancakes were HUGE and so tasty. The Snow White omelet egg white omelet was fantastic and a MUST try is the Crispy French Toast. Whenever in Vegas this will be a definite stop! Yuta spelling? is a wonderful, sweet lady that showed us nothing but LOVE xoxoox ps we were even given baklava as an after breakfast treat. ",2
"One year later and this restaurant is still going strong! I love the location, the food, and the service. I love supporting a restaurant that is helping others. My fav is the pan fried chicken with delicious vegie sides pared with an OMB Copper, but I have tasted several other dishes and enjoyed them all!",2
"U should call this place Robertos. and that would be an insult to mr. roberto himself. i had the fish tacos of course and wow were they plain. just think of middle school lunch fish in a bland torilla. flavorless. u would think with a name ""wahoo's fish tacos "" their tacos would be good. this is really a bar. the bar is good and it has gaming so go here to drink and gamble not eat.",1
"Great little place, recommended to me by Tonia M. Bartz. I went in today, and found a great pan don't underestimate a great pan , and an ice cream maker, with two freezer bowls. The thing is, I bought this same ice cream maker at a garage sale, not realizing it was missing the freezer bowl. Now I have two complete ice cream makers to feed my inner fat kid! Good prices, too!",2
"A must see in Montreal. I can't say much that hasn't been said before. Great produce, meats and cheeses. There are all types of unique Quebec products and gifts. Plus, lots and lots of free samples. Schedule about half a day if it's Summer , relax and have lunch. The crepes are recommended. If you miss this market, you are selling your trip short.",2
"Every single time I've come to this location, they forget my salad dressing. How hard is your job? Really? This is the closet location to my parents house, where I take my son swimming often during the week. It's 20 minutes away. We got all the way home and once again, no dressing. Must be my fault for continuing to come to this location and expecting someone to do their job correctly.",1
"We came here on our way out of the casino at 2 in the morning and grabbed the last slice of the day! We had the meaty pizza not sure what it is but it was so delicious and fed 2 of us for our walk back to the hotel. Maybe it was the beer we were drinking, but it really hit the spot for some good pizza. Staff was very friendly for us coming so late too which was a definite plus!",2
"Great food! Great, personalized service. We're from out of town and read the reviews. We wanted to eat somewhere ""off "" the strip. Something good but less expensive. This was a great choice. It is somewhat like fast food, but there are healthy choices, grilled chicken and vegetable skewers. And, the not so healthy, to die for, Mac and Cheese. YUM!",2
Order taker spoke good english. The delivery woman was nice . Mongolian pork not enough pork. Should be called Mongolian onions. Sesame chicken too soggy. Too much rice and noodles as sides not enough entre. Egg rolls were okay crab puffs did not have enough cheese nor any crab or artificial crab for that matter. Won't order here again . Favorite thing from meal was the spicy mustard !,1
"Inexpensive at 8.99 for dinner. We went on Christmas night and the food was pretty bad overall but some of the items were good fried chicken wings, bok choy, shrimp, daikon beef soup, and the soft ice cream machine. I thought the waitresses were efficient at taking the plates, too. What can you expect for 8.99 dinner? It's just mass quantities of biomatter when you come down to it!",1
I decieded to visit the new place in Cave Creek. I noticed the reviews were either good or bad. I did not go on a weekend because I wanted to miss the crowds as they have some entertainment during the week. The menu was limited but what they served was very good and plenty to eat. The Wednesday night entertaiment was great . Kept me there for a couple hours,2
No service. Slow service. Bad customer service. We ordered a beef stew pho. Broth had no taste. The beed had no taste or the vegetable. We complained to the server his respond is that's the beef stew we serve I don't know what you want me to do. I asked to exchange something else. His response we don't do that. We left no tip. Horrible experience!,1
I was looking for a new nail place after being overcharged and rushed at the last few places. Found an deal on yelp for CCNails. Vivian and Peter were awesome 65 for gel mani and reg pedi. With the discount it came to 58. Vivian did an great pedicure and peter did a great job getting creative with my manicure. I will definitely be back. Very clean and relaxing place.,2
Went here for lunch with a co worker last week. The place seemed to be run by teenagers who left after taking our order to go back to high school. We shared spicy beef and spicy and salted seafood dishes. The spicy beef was ok at best. The seafood was more like dog food. We both felt sick as dogs all afternoon. Very nauseous! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!,1
"I moved from L.A. to Phoenix a few years ago and missed the little cool small shop restaurant places with character. Le Grande Orange made me feel at home, and now that I'm back in L.A. I'm super psyched to find out there seems to be a new one opening in Pasadena. Does anyone know if this is the same owners? Looks like it. I HOPE SO!",2
"This is the kind of Vegetarian food that makes me think I could never eat meat again. Its delicious, flavorful and healthy. I had the Balsamic Picnic Salad, a tasty combination of fresh dark greens, figs, strawberries and tart green apples. We also had the Green Hummus and Artichoke Gratine. Yum! I can't wait to go back! I think next time I will definitely have to try the Tsoynami.",2
"New menu as of December. Big mistakes. Weird combos of sweet and salty on the burgers. Dangerous crack on the wooden plate the quesadilla came on, no idea how they think this is considered safe. It's uncleanable. Can't be washed. Service took forever too. Go elsewhere, or if you must come, go with the 5 tacos. They were good.",1
"Hopalicious. The Up North is a Madison institution, a wonderfully unpretentious, homey, solidly good neighborhood bar. Stocked with a selection of local beers on tap, free peanuts and popcorn, they also have darts and a number of large screens covering sporting events. The floor is covered with peanut shells, which is a Wisconsin Illinois thing, so be warned.",2
"I'd have to start by saying their beer was crisp and cold. I loved how they had a variety of beers to choose from. My score would have to be in regards to poor service manners. Lastly, the food was terrible! The nachos were not fresh and the cheese was not enjoyable. I even attempted to try their pizza which I found to be even too salty to eat.",1
"Nice burger place to eat at for lunch. And it's quick service. You can be in and out within an hour. My favorites on the menu consist of the whiskey river bbq burger, mini wedge salad, red's tavern double, nWhiskey river bbq chicken wrap, freckled lemonade, and their bottomless fries. You can't go wrong with eating here. My food is consistently good. Yum!",2
"I'm a big fan of Turkish food and there's almost none to be found in Vegas until I saw pide being served here! So I took my friends with me and ordered the white pide. It was really cheesy, soft, and more American than Turkish but it was still pretty good. My friends ordered their sandwiches and they were very decently sized. A good lunch spot with many healthy options.",2
"The usurious late fees and onerous cancellation policy make this gym one step above a pay day loans joint. The men who use the weights are more interested in strutting then getting down to business, and the pool at the central location is full of couples stealing second and third base right out in the open. I do not recommend it.",1
"Had a burger here before my flight and the chef was nice enough to split my plate with my mom we were hungry, but not enough to each have a burger . They had a generous amount of fries and even added extra seasoning per my request. If you're in the airport waiting for your flight and looking for a place to eat, they may seem pricey but its because they actually have good food.",2
Today I called Mike from the carpet guy and he was super helpful! My daughter graduates Sunday and family will be here in 2 days so I really needed my carpet cleaned today. Even though he was busy he came by and did a great job after hours to help out AND he was extra nice. I recommend them 1000 . Great job!,2
"I love Olive Garden.! I took my boyfriend here for his first time the other week. He enjoyed it very much! This restaurant is pretty busy, probably because of location. We lucked out, a huge party left as we say down. Our waitress was amazing.! She definitely more than made up for the crowdedness. Food was quick and delicious.",2
I can only speak for the cell phone booth. While on vacation my phone acted up so I ran to get a new one. The guy acted like he was Pisces off to be the and chatted on his phone with what seemed to be some friend. when I asked for some help I was told he was busy and it would be at least an hour. I was the ONLY one standing there.,1
Nice place with a great view of the Bellagio Fountains. Came here while we were waiting for our reservations at Mon Ami Gabi to have a couple of drinks. Both of the drinks we had were very good. I forgot the name of them but mine had some fresh berries and champagne and my gf's was a fruity one with a strawberry type froth on top.,2
We arrived rather late and hour before closing and were told we would have to eat in the bar area. One of the best steaks I've ever had. I got the filet and believe it was 8oz. it was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of seasonings. I also got a potato on the side and it too was great. A must go to steak house. Staff was very friendly as well and refilled drinks quickly.,2
"1. Staff are not friendly and they are very condasending. This is my exspeirence from the the front gate, Vallet and front desk. No one goes above and beyond or ever hear about Customer Service. n2. Be aware that the towers except tower 2 close at night. n3. The rooms are OK, but lack things like locks on the bathroom doors.",1
"always on point kevinsthebest fiiiiire nCome here now! nThe shop is spotless, all the staff is wonderful, and Kevin really takes his time to make sure you're comfortable and really pleased with his work. He's so creative I just give him free reign on my nails and he's NEVER disappointed me. Keep it up Kevin, I'll be spreading the word everywhere ! Thank you !",2
"This is your classic neighborhood bar. Love the hamburgers fries wings, and even the salads are really good. Every Thursday they have Steiight, which my family loves and we frequent probably once a month. The price is right the food is good the drinks are cold. They have plenty of TVs for sports so this is A big sports bar.",2
"Never any meat on the sandwich, and the employees overcharge without explanation. Ive been to other subway stores that are not that bad but this one takes the cake. Will not be going back. It's hilarious to watch the employee count the amount of slices of meat they put on your sandwich and if you ask for extra they put two more slices on and charge you two more dollars. RIP OFF!",1
Love this place! Kim does an amazing job on my nails. I usually get a gel manicure and they last forever I love that they take their time with each customer to ensure quality work and experience. I've also heard the pedicures are great too but I have yet to get one. I definitely will soon though. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.,2
"Amazing. I never liked Thai food until a friend brought me here. It's kind of a hole in the wall and a bit difficult to find if you're not familiar with the area, but it's so worth the effort to find! Great lunch specials and great service! The food is definitely a 5 star in my opinion, but there is often a sulfur like smell emanating from the restroom area.",2
This club has honestly hired the most inept people. I was thrown out for allegedly throwing beer when I was 100 not even close to doing that. Worst club I've been to in Vegas and I've been to several clubs in this town. If you want to have fun here go to marquee or hakkasan for the love of god skip this abortion of a club.,1
"I'm not changing my review, but in fairness, after reading my post a manager from the restaurant contacted me to apologize for the food and gave me a full refund, which is pretty great. She offered me a free dinner at The House of Blues here in LA. Haven't had a chance to take her up on it, but if I do I'll report back.",1
Came in for a massage on a Saturday. I came in and I was having a really bad day. I was feeling very emotional and it just felt so amazing to get some of those bad vibes out of my body. Mare's hands were magic! She felt like she had five arms working at the same time! It felt amazing and I will definitely be back! ,2
"Ugh. cramped quarters with the bizarre pool table room, hip hop room and large DJ area. Came to see Tiesto and maybe it was the crowd with a few serious douchebags. Tiesto killed it though so props to him. Probably wouldn't be back unless it was to see Calvin Harris. Hopefully they can make some changes on capacity and 9 for a mini bottle of Fiji. Meh overall",1
"Perfect place. Comparing service to the Strip Restaurants, not quite there, but miles ahead most local bars. Food was great, and I have been told is all fresh, made in house daily including sauces, dips and dressings. Excellent beer selection, on draft, and perfect serving temperature. Steaks are best in town. Always clean.",2
"I went with extremely high expectations. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met. I didn't feel the passion connection among the actors. Sure they get naked, have some fun, and are naughty. I thought there would be more of a connection where you could feel the love and passion between the people on stage. I think this could be done with appropriate music and eye contact and caressing.",1
"Always quiet and dead. This is one of those ""if you're not a regular, get the hell outta here "" kinda bars. Food is straight from the freezer, onto your plate. Service leaves much to be desired unless you're a regular, then you're treated like royalty . Only gets a 2nd star because the place looks nice and is clean. For the most part. Stay away!",1
"Well, add me to the list. Bill is Mr. High Voltage had him out for a couple jobs, one some improvements, one repairs. Prices were reasonable, work was done timely and well, there is really not a lot more to say. I am scratching electrician off my list because I'm covered and will be calling these guys if I ever need help again.",2
"I bought the Toulouse crepe, which reminded of a pizza before eating. The crepe looked delicious and was freshly made. The Fresh basil on top was a nice touch The mariana sauce was cold when they put it on top of the crepe so it ruined the entire dish. This also made the cheese clump together faster, making it more dissatisfying by the bite. It had so much potential! I'm disappointed.",1
Absolutely terrible. We did not receive all the items in our order and they were not willing to fix it AND they did not give us a refund for the item. So basically they stole from us. The two pizzas they did deliver were burnt and the sandwich we ordered was bland and accompanied by soggy French fries. AVOID THIS PIT. MANY BETTER OPTIONS.,1
Worst service. My friend is trying to transfer money from her account to her landlord's bank account. She has been in the bank for 55 minutes! And still in there! About 20 people have come and gone. She stated that the clerk helping her was helping another customer are the same time. Going back and forth with them. Ridiculous! Seems like poor customer service!,1
"I'd never experienced having a mechanic take the time to call me a couple days after the repair to ensure the part he replaced fixed the problem. That exemplified the kind of care and service I've gotten from Westside Service Center over the years. They're honest, straightforward in their diagnoses, and never try to upsell me oon essential repairs. I highly recommend these guys.",2
"I would rate this 5 stars if I was into rating places that aren't full service 5 stars. This place is amazing! I very much enjoyed this, all of the food was excellent and the service was good as well. The crab was nice and fresh, the food was hot and served correctly. Seasoning was spot on on everything!",2
"Wow. I came here at 3 am because I was hungry. the bartender, Ricky, threw the menu at me, gave me the ultimatum when i ordered wings. The worst service i have ever seen! Not only that, I left him tip on the table, and he came by and made a sarcastic comment about it. He was lucky i even left him a tip! Seriously the worst PTs I have ever been to and I am born and raised here. I should know.",1
"I went around 4pm for a salad. It took 15 min just to get my order in and another 20 to get my salad to my table. The restaurant was fully staffed and around 35 full. Even if staffing was an issue, 20 min to mix dressing with arugula is ridunkulous. I gave it an extra star because the bartender was nice enough to give me a discount for the wait.",1
"I get that the restaurant is new, but I walked in at 7 28 AM for breakfast. Saw several customers seated and waiting for a server or food or something. Waited to be seated. Waited. Got a couple smiles from seated customers who were sharing my experience. Waited a bit more. Not an employee in sight. Walked out at 7 38. I'll probably give them another chance. But not this week.",1
"FAIL. Ahi poke was NOT Ahi poke.it was an Ahi seaweed salad for 15. No Bueno. The sushi was okay, it wasn't all that great. This is place is just convenient for hung over people craving sushi at the Mandalay. I do not recommend if you want REAL tasty sushi. It's not too terrible, but this is not an ideal sushi place.",1
"This place looks awesome, the atmosphere is great and the kitchen in full view is top notch. The plates are on the small side, but I like that usually too much food on the plate . And the food was great, except for that odd chorizo bread thing. Okay, the Fried Chicken isn't Montreal's best, but it's damn good and definitely NOT dry. The service was excellent too.",2
"It was good but WAY overpriced. For that reason alone, I wouldn't ever return. We got a half pound burger with onion rings, a 1 3rd lb burger with onion rings, small chili cheese fries chili wasn't that great with drinks. It was a whopping 30. All that and we had to clean off our own table and go get our own food. For that price, I'd expect more.",1
"This is one of the worst hotel experiences ever. First of all the room is outdated the furnitire smelled old, looked about 50 years old, and the dark ugly carpet was stained and torn and had cigarette burns. No wifi. Also their staff constantly bugs you offering tickets for shows etc. I would never stay here again.",1
"if youve never been here its like an alcoholic slurpee. Prices are good. Drinks are even better haha. Most bang for your buck and of course you will get on a ""good level "" with one of these. Flavors are really good and you always have the choice of adding more shots for just a dollar each. This fat tursday is pretty big tooo and theres seats right in front good place to go.",2
I loved this place. They serve very good cocoa and amazing coffee. They make the coffee one cup at a time. Parking is a problem but the service made up for it. The young woman behind the counter was warm and friendly. She made us feel at home and welcome. I am really happy we tried this place out. We will be returning.,2
"Located inside and upstairs this place recalls the glory days of college dining halls. Ugh. I think my omelet stayed with me all day. Something like 15 hours of energy from the grease of gross of my omelet. Blech. 3.49 cent strajk and eggs, if you're a member of the rewards club. nOtherwise its 7.99. Skip it.",1
"Skeptical diner at Chelsea's Kitchen in Phoenix but was proven wrong. Reminds me a lot of North located in Scottsdale and Tucson. Great spot for a happy hour, date or a family dinner. Had an excellent tuna and spinach salad with spicy ginger dressing. Found the service to be quite good and a very comfortable relaxed atmosphere. A spot like this was needed in that Camelback location.",2
Never shop or buy anything from Conns. If you buy anything through their credit it's 3x more then what your buying and they screw you over every way possible. Myself and 30 other people have a lawsuit filed with the attorney General of phoenix Arizona and BBB is investigating their fraudulent practices. Please message me if they have fraudulently screwed you over.,1
I went to CHIROFIT for a car accident and was very nervous at first. The staff and Dr. Stamp are amazing. I felt so comfortable and referred my whole family to the office. They handled my insurance claim with ease and I never felt overwhelmed at any point as they took control and handled everything. HIghly recomend them!,2
"This place has great food for the price lunch buffet . It is not a disappointment either on selection. They actually had one of my favorites which have been difficult to find in a buffet, vegetable samosa.very yummy. Unlike a lot of Indian places, the food was not too salty. Definitely will be a repeat customer.",2
"So far so good. I love the guy that is usually there. I believe he owns it. They just brought in a new girl that I am not to thrilled with. My husband ordered food that was never delivered and in front of everyone she said he didn't but we all heard him. Even if he didn't, don't argue with your guests they pay to eat your food not the other way around.",2
I used to love this place now I hate it. I went to dinner tonight Tuesday and the place was basically empty so should be fast. It was one of the worst service experiences I have ever had. I ordered a seasonal draft and was brought a two dollar light draft and our server was more than inattentive. So don't waste your time.,1
"Pros n The prices on the produce is great when on sale. Cons n some of the produce is rotton moldy n customer service is HORIBLE. As a non spanish speaker, trying to get help is difficult. When I asked a produce worker to purchase some items in the box that he was stocking, he IGNORED me. Way to go La Bonita.",1
I had one of your mini cupcakes at a Giants baseball game for the first time Setting up your adorable food trunk was a GREAT idea! I wish I was able to have more But I was quite full from lunch. I only hope Gigi's cupcakes has a store in old town Scottsdale one day soon! You guys would kick Sprinkles booty! I caot wait to go back to a Giants spring training game and order more! Great work! o ,2
"The Mirage is OK but this review is more about their gym, or lack thereof. How can you have a resort hotel this size, with massive conference facilities, and have a gym that's so tiny? The gym consists of 6 treadmills, 5 stairclimbers, and 5 cross trainers. And 2 of the machines were broken. And there was a line out the door. Sooooo lame!",1
"Great selection variety of styles, sizes and the customer service is above par. nFree popcorn definitely is a plus and the bathrooms really aren't bad. nAs far as shoes go, largest in the world 60,000 pairs plus they are more than willing to find what your looking for through another store or online! Can't go wrong.",2
"Highly recommended by several friends, I found the food to be marginal. Nothing real special here. The service was great, attentive and friendly. The margaritas were excellent though. All in all, not anything I cant find at my local Macayo's. Just remembered, the bathroom Men's was a mess, also not handicap accessable.",1
"This was a great place to get away from the hustle of Vegas. We relaxed here around 4pm, when we had our pick of loveseats. Yeah, the drinks are pricey 16 , but you're also paying for the view ambiance and it's Vegaaas . Recommended Pear A Sol Absolut Pears Vodka Belle Paire Pear Liqueur pear puree fresh sweet and sour more please! and Cucumber Ginger Cooler.",2
"Amazing view from up there, both at night and day. I have been on top on the strat 3 times now and every time I'm really stunned. Still, every time I see the Vegas lights at night, I feel almost guilty of all this energy that we are all wasting. I keep my lights off at night, and thats all I can do about it.",2
"I have to disagree that Denny's is similar to this place. I have been here twice for breakfast and it was yummy both times. A lot more ""homey "" feeling than a commerical Dennys. Staff is always nice, always there to give you something before you ask for it. Buttermilk biscuits are yum, eggs perfect, potatoes are good. Prices are cheap!",2
"KOOLAID KID reminded me of home.nice touch.i know I know.this is suppose to be about the chicken waffles, but I must say quenching my thirst is very important to me.so back to the food.it was just that chickeo flavor waffles nothing special .mac cheese was very nice.and the new building was very very nice.okay that's all",1
Went back a second time no hostess waited 5 minutes no one greeted us or even acknowledged us I walked out wife stayed and spoke to management on duty that night and they acted as if they didn't care that there staff was offering such poor service. They have one more chance to get it right three strikes and your out,1
"Ticoz is not a bad place. The menu is eclectic american and the service has always been friendly, consistent, and attentive. All the food I've had there has been decent and the prices aren't bad either. This is a gay friendly restaurant so it's a good place to consider for a same sex date. It's also a good place for large groups.",2
"OMG OMG OMG. It's finally open. The Triforce of Target, Trader Joe's, and Whole Foods is finally complete and I caow go defeat Ganon and rescue Princess Zelda. While I love the organic food at whole paycheck, I just afford to shop there all the time. That's where Trader Joe's comes in. Affordable, High Quality Organic food, along with the best frozen meals you could ever want.",2
"This place is delicious, period. Awesome atmosphere, great place to hang out outside. Fresh food from the farm. It's no little pricey, but it's worth it if you can spend a little more on lunch, very reasonable compared to a lot of places that have really good food. It won't let you down. Go here and try it for yourself",2
"First time in Arizona with family and went to Oregano's in Tempe the other night. Atmosphere was wonderful and everyone was so nice! As for the food, just as good as the pizza back home! We loved the option to do half and half on whichever pizzas you wanted to. The Rosemary chicken pizza is a must try and don't forget to have a cookie pizza!",2
"I love me some good poutine and being a pescetarian, it's always hard to find one that is meatless. Well this place here allows you to make your own and I got the classic poutine with a sunny side up egg on top. Needless to say, this hit the spot and was absolutely delicious. The service was great and the folks there were attentive. I'd definitely come back here again for sure.",2
"This is one of my favorite places to go. I almost always have the Filet with a loaded baked potato and a glass or two of merlot. The staff is always courteous and quick, the food is always cooked perfectly it is a little on the pricey side though.Especially if you have any drinks while you are there.",2
I actually love this store the items are unique and it's really a fun place to explore. However you would think that when a person is spending 3000 in a place they would let you use the restroom! Nope they refuse to allow me to use the rest room and made me go across the street to use it at a restaurant. HOW RUDE is that? I have not gone back since then.,1
I have wanted to try this place out for a while and I was extremely let down. The service was very inattentive and when I got my food out was made wrong in several ways. After I brought it to the male managers attention I was offended in how he treated me. Being the manager of a local hotel I can say that I will never ever recommend any guest to try this place. Very disappointing.,1
"Love shopping at town square. The choices of retailers are great. My favorite place is the container store, where I can easily spend hours. Parking is ample, and convenient to all the stores. It can get hot walking around in the summer, but we tend to shop in the evening so no issues there. The restaurant offerings are great as well, lots to choose from.",2
"Well I stopped in here for a drink. This was the first time I've been here and found the crowd to be a bit touristy. Things did get rather busy by about 10 30pm, and the music was OK. Not the best place I've been to in the area, but worthy of a stop to see what sort of characters there are to see. I think this would be a good spot for singles.",1
"I recently was helped by Jordan Leugers at 5114s Rural Rd., Tempe. I would like to say that I was very pleased with the help I got from Jordan. He was very patient with me as I asked questions about my new phone. It is great to know that any future questions that I may have I can go to the store and get the help I need. Toni R. nTempe, AZ",2
This place is way overrated. The frozen hot chocolate is yucky. Starbucks Frappuccino is way better and less than half the price. I don't get it. Is it because these people on TV say oh I must go there and you follow too. I'm sure the rent is terrible for them. They might survive but only because of new tourists arriving each month.,1
"I don't think I can do it again, but I gave it a shot. Husband ordered filet mignoachos and shared some of my entree as well. He said he enjoyed it, but, honestly, I think his taste buds and judgment were clouded by the margaritas he drank before the food was served. I ordered the enchilada trio and an iced tea. The iced tea was great.and I'll leave it at that.",1
"One of the best liege waffles I've ever eaten. The waffles are are made from yeast dough instead of batter. It has such a buttery, rich taste. The texture is just perfect. Really soft and moist. Not dry like some other liege waffles I've had. This place is one of the places I miss most about Pittsburgh.",2
"The place is very neighborhood friendly place. There were some stuff on sale in the front part of the cafe, and the waitresses are very busy. We ordered veggie omelet and a skillet, and they were both amazing. The omelet was very good in portion and quality 4 eggs ones oh yeah , and the skillet was just amazing. Based on their prize, they were definitely worth going back again.",2
"I love the pianos, but the bar staff could use some people skills, we came in late so the piano players were wrapping up, we were sitting at the bar playing poker and after our first drink for us and buying some for our friends with us at like 27 for two regular drinks we completely got ignored and could not even get eye contact for almost 30 minutes till we finally just left.",1
"The Herb Box is a great place to go for food in Old Town. I usually go in the market for a sandwich during lunch, but have also had dinner there too. The food is consistently very good and the employees are friendly. It is a bit on the pricey side for sandwiches and a la carte items, but I have not been let down there yet!",2
"Their claim of so tender that you don't need teeth to eat it is wrong.that pulled pork was tough n dry.the BBQ sauce was hot, mildly spicy but not sweet or thick.good size servings, the sides of coleslaw n Mac n cheese were good but the meat left something to be desired.if you ever go to lock harts in tax, you'd say the same thing .oh and the ladies room need to be renovated.",1
"Came here with my sister to get her scooter puma oil change and they said they can't change the oil and we understand but then we go ahead and try to ask if they sell the type of particular oil but they don't even want to answer the question, and acted like we weren't even there and because we didn't buy the scooter there. Service not good but have a good selections of bikes. Not recommended.",1
Recently I went on a no heart attach diet and became a Vegan I was already a Las Vegan . In the store there is a corner where Trader Joe's has some really good food products available that are made for people trying to round out their fruit and vegetable diets without eating meat. Kudos for providing these products. nOne suggestion maybe you might want to consider providing edamame.,2
"I've eaten here a few times, but the last 2 times I've noticed that the food quality is not as good as it used to be in the past. Last weekend was terrible! Service was bad slow, waitress said we had to ask for bread if we wanted it, rushing me to pay the bill I still gave her 18 tip regardless. , complained that she worked straight 8 hrs! I give this restaurant 2 stars.disappointing!",1
"Tried it for the first time with friends found amazing. All of us were all praise for the quality of the food served. nThe only down side is cost service extremely slow. Also the description of the items in the menu are too cryptic to appear English. nBut if you are ready to really wait that long, have got patience lots of money P then you won't regret dining here.",2
"After the last 2 to go orders the quality was very low. I'm not sure if I had a string of bad luck but this recent order alone the salmoigiri was fishy, the California rolls were oddly very sweet, the spicy yellowfin was the blandest sushi I've ever tasted, it wasn't spicy either. Because their prices are low they get an extra star. I'm sad because I really liked them at first. ",1
"Nice vision center, I'm new to Las Vegas and I discovered this place on my side of town. Clean facility, young but very knowledgeable eye doctor. Equipment state of the art and very high tech. Only thing they need to work on is the wait time. Every time I visit I can count on a 10 minute wait. But great place overall.",2
"In a world full of nail salons oearly every block like Starbucks, Y Me Nails and Spa really distinguishes themselves with their friendly services, professionalism, and welcoming atmosphere. Their reasonable prices are attractive, but clients continuously return for their service. When you're in the area, stop by this salon. You'll feel pampered.",2
"1 star is a compliment for this place. The service is literally terrible every single time. Servers don't check on their tables, they don't introduce themselves, and they never look happy. Not only do the servers suck, the entire rest of the staff just seems unhappy and rude in general. Avoid this location.",1
" Lots of food, feed, and supplies for your standard farm animals, plus food supplies for cats, dogs, and pet birds. Excellent equine selection. Cute, adorable baby chickies for purchase and to cuddle. Reasonable prices. Clean restroom from handling the chickies or after consuming a Starbucks Venti beverage . Plentiful parking. Friendly employees. Open 7 days a week.",2
"Ordered rotisserie chicken and a tossed salad for delivery. Received the rotisserie chicken and A HALF EATEN PIZZA! When I called to inquire about my salad and let them know about the pizza, I was told ""my bad that was the pizza we were eating that box wasn't supposed to go to you "" however they did bring my salad right back and picked up their half eaten pizza.",1
"The prices are the same, but the pizza is totally different. I ordered the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza which I usually order when I go to CPK. The pizza taste like it was from my high school cafeteria. The cheese was rubbery, the pepperoni was burnt, and the sausage tasted 5 days old. Don't eat here expecting normal CPK quality food.",1
"This was so bad that it has warranted my first post on Yelp. The margaritas are 12, and I'm not sure they contain alcohol in them. The margarita ""slurpee "" we were given was sickeningly sweet it literally sobered me up on impact. All 3 of my friends and I threw our drinks away after a couple of sips.unbearable.that's a whopping waste of 48. Do yourself a favor and DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!",1
"This is one of those restaurants that are attached to a hotel. It seems everything I'd ever ordered here, has arrived in a chrome cylindrical stand with paper. Kind of like how everything at Dicks Last resort comes in a bucket. The food would likely satisfy a hungry traveler staying at the hotel, but, otherwise, I would not add this to my circulation.",1
This is great casual wine bar to have a drink and the food is very good as well!nThey have outdoor patio area which is nice in cooler weather. The prices are very good here and great for a date night or meeting friends! Its in Old town Scottsdale area which we love. They have couch and chairs to sit in as well inside.,2
"I feel like Barro's is so good it barely eveeeds a review so I'll keep it brief. I put in an order for pickup, showed up a little early but it was ready to go so I didn't have to wait. The girl at the counter was friendly and of course the pizza itself a mini White pizza, perfect for 1 person! was delicious. I'm obviously going to be coming back.",2
"Nice bar but expensive. Not a great location for tea time. Went to tea time a while back, really bad place for it. Afternoon tea should not be overlooking the casino. nWent back recently. Was killing time. I asked if they could seat just 1. I was put at a table by the bar. It took forever to get waited on. nDon't go there if you are a single middle aged woman!",1
Bitter nasty old men at gun counter. Manager Ken is the sorriest excuse for a. Customer service representative that I ever have seen went into purchase to A.R. 15's at approximately 4000 walk out an hour later without receiving any help whatsoever called corporate and the stores regional manager waiting for response,1
"Went here with my parents, hubby and kiddo for St. Patty's day. I had THE best corned beef sandwich I have ever had. My Dad loved the corned beef hash, and my Mom hubby were so pleased with the corned beef cabbage they wish it was on the menu as a permanent item. Kid had mac n cheese, as she is wont to do, and as always had the best time chatting with our servers about whatever was on her mind.",2
"The best grocery store I've ever been in! It was packed full of fresh, organic, local products. The produce looked and tasted! amazing. The vegetarian and vegan options were plentiful, and the service we got was friendly and helpful. This place would have been a 5 star, except they added a 10 charge because we weren't members, AND they don't sell wine Other than that what a place!",2
I ate here for the first. And last time tonight. I ordered the lasagna and it came out barely warm. There was nothing too it at all. For twelve bucks I was expecting more. The sauce tasted like chef boyardee. It didn't even come with garlic bread. Maybe their pizza is better. I would save your money if I were you!,1
"Worest frederick's of Hollywood I have ever been in. No selection, and unhappy and unhelpful sales people. The one sales girl was just sitting on the floor behind the register like she didn't even want to be there, the other couldn't help me find what I was looking for. Don't go to this one, use the fashion show or boulavard location!",1
"I remember going to CPK years ago in NY and enjoying it. But I must say I was really disappointed. We ordered a Roasted Artichoke Spinach Pizza, but it was just ok. Maybe I'm just comparing it to Picazzo's AMAZING Puttanesca, but this was a fail. It wasn't nasty, it just wasn't all that. And we were starving so it should have been delicious.",1
"If you're looking for the worst pizza in Western Pennsylvania, this is the winner. Greasy cold mess. Ever order I've gotten from here has been either super cold when it was delivered or burnt when I went to pick it up. The staff is unhelpful. They just stood there and looked at me blankly when I asked for a refund for the pizza I just picked up with a blackened crust. Never again.",1
We went there last night around 12 30am. Tofu Hut was open for another hour and a half. Two families of 6 were seated and immediately after the lady working there told us we were not welcome to eat there after we've already waited 15 minutes to eat. I'm not sure why exactly we were profiled and there were several open tables.,1
"I don't get to this side of town, since I prefer the casino's along the strip. My friend who is a local suggested the Oyster Bar the Palace Station. I ordered the Crab Meat Pan Roast, it was GREAT! Surprisingly I enjoyed the food and the casino isn't as crowded as the ones on the strip. Great Crab Pan Roast!",2
"When in Vegas and especially staying around the North Strip, make the trip off the strip to Komol. Some of the best Thai food I have ever had, particularly the absolutely delicious Panang Chicken and Chili Mint Pork. Even better is the fantastic service they treat you like a valued friend rather than a one time visitor possibly a function of being off the strip a ways.",2
I don't know why this place gets such good reviews. We had a horrible experience at lunch. It is a very small buffet. Not much selection at all. And all the food was dry and flavorless I seriously couldn't find a single thing I liked. and not for lack of trying. I'm not to hard to please but this place is not worth the price. Very dissatisfied. The only good thing was the decor.,1
This is the WORST doctors office EVER. This is my first pregnancy and I couldnt have been more disapointed with the service here. I didnt have a SINGLE appointment where I was seen quicker than an HOUR AFTER my scheduled appointment. The doctor has NO REGARD WHATSOEVER for the patients time and it is BEYOND RUDE and unacceptable. I wouldnt recommend this place to aan enemy. Do NOT waste your time.,1
"So after the Kookie got her new ride nWe decided to look at some parts nWere ready to buy, asked ""Shawn "" if they had a ""Locking Gas Door for a Yukon "" nhe checked the computer an said ""NOPE "" so we said ok, looked around an on the North wall, what do our eyes find.The Correct Locking Gas Door. He needs to go back to fast food or the trailer he left unoccupied.",1
This place has the best vegetarian Pho I have ever tasted. The spring rolls are also excellent. The atmosphere is quite modern and fancy for being in a grocery store plaza. For the price the place is amazing. It is the best restaurant I've been to in the area definitely the superior than the other places I've visited in Mekong Plaza .,2
"We went to Fiddlesticks on Saturday evening, there were 3 of us. The price was 7 a person, but I had some entertainment book coupons, so it was 2 for 1. The course was terrible, the turf on the course, was ripped in places, there were lots of ants, I found a few insects and bugs in the hole of the course. We had fun, but wouldn't go back to that course.",1
I was very excited to try the new Ramen Bar in Squirrel Hill. nI was sadly disappointed with my food. nThe broth had GREAT flavor but the chicken and vegetables were BLAND. nIt tasted like the chicken and veggies had absoloutely no seasoning. nThe atmosphere was okay. nThe weight staff was extremely nice and helpful.,1
"Brunch was mediocre. Our waiter seemed to be having a rough day or was super nervous. I couldn't even finish the quiche I ordered because it was too salty tasting, and the eggs didn't taste of terribly high quality or freshness. And then, of course, its not the most affordable thing. It took way to long to be waited on and served. nI wouldn't go back.",1
"Jason's Deli on Centrum Parkway is always busy at lunch. I have always eaten at their salad bar, which is actually quite tiny. For a salad buffet, Souper Salad offers significantly more salad toppings and additional buffet options at a similar price. I feel like I never get my money's worth at Jason's, though the salads there are tasty and nutritious.",1
"One of the best buffets in Vegas. Yes, it even beats the M Resort's Studio B or Wynn's Buffet. Really good was the shrimp cocktail, fried rice, bun mi roast pork sammies , carrot cake, french macaroons stuffed with fresh fruit, clams in curry coconut sauce, tacos, fried chicken wings. nAdvice, if more than one person, have one pay and the other one go stand in line to the left.",2
Ive never been a huge fan of indian food. This place may have changed my mind. Dont be fooled by the location its alot nicer on the inside then it appears from the parking lot. The staff was really nice and the pricing was very reasonable. 4 entrees and 2 appetizers for 40 bucks. Ill be back for sure.,2
"PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE. Eww place is the nastiest place. I would never stay here ever.first of all they have a freaky mirror on top of the bed, it makes me think what kind of people slept on this bed. FYI there is no island theme here. Its fucking disgusting the rooms smells bad, the hall way smells bad. They had a 60's tv in the room. I would never ever go there agaiot even for the casino.",1
"The 8 falafel sandwich was good with green cabbage and hummus, made a filling lunch on the go. But aside from the sandwiches, everything here is wayyyyyy too pricey. I paid 9 for beef cigars, and it was four tiny rolls of beef fried in flaky dough. Put together, they're like one egg roll's worth of food. I literally laughed out loud when I opened the container and saw how little that 9 bought. ",1
"I'm just gonna go out and say it I dont know if this is the best pizza in town, but I don't think anyone else can firmly beat it. Their whole just shy of 1000 degrees for a few minutes style of baking makes for a crisp pizza, and their options will please most people. Solid lunch spot. Try the Porta Alba Pizza buffalo mozzarella and lemon slices make for a happy diner.",2
"Always great food. They have such a great selection if burgers that are all amazing. The Wagyu beef is phenomenal. You should try the truffle Parmesan fries. Also, try the milkshakes. They are wonderful either with your meal or as a dessert. Overall, you should try this restaurant. It is a very good experience. nSometimes the service is slow, but overall the experience is always great.",2
"Most incredible meal I've ever had, and I used to live in New York City, people. My server was so friendly, and even suggested that we share the bone in filet cooked to medium rare with the king alaskan crab she said it was better than the stone crab. And i Have to agree. Absolutely superb. My meal was two weeks ago and I'm STILL thinking about it. Please open a restaurant in LA!",2
"I tried this nail salon as a last minute new set. The lady did my nails too thin and no matter how many times I asked her to add another layer of acrylic she said trust me I know what I'm doing. My nails are paper thin, way too short from where she cut the tip and not at all what I asked for! Now I have to find another salon to get my nails fixed.",1
"I had this company replace a shower at my house. It should have taken 7 to 10 days. It took 4 weeks to finish. nThe worst part was trying to deal with the owner and project manager. When I contacted them to voice my displeasure, they just did not care. No customer service what so ever. None. nThey only showed up to pick up deposit and final payment. I would NOT recommend this company to anyone.",1
Yogurt sold by the ounce? And it's tasty? We've got a winner. I have an active but small sweet tooth. This is my place. I no longer have to spend 6 and 6 million calories on a Coldstone offering of which I will only eat half. Beautiful customization. It must be working because these things have popped up everywhere. And I thought the Gelato craze was going to last longer.,2
"Terrible is the only word to describe our stay. nWe stayed there last month and had a terrible experience. Slow check in Just key collection took over 45 minutes! , rude reception staff including the duty manager who refused to accept that check in was slow! as well as getting over charged, the hotel was awful. nI wouldn't recommend this hotel at all.",1
The atmosphere in this restaurant is truly authentic. The experience is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The food was great. The dancer was amazing. The wait staff friendly. The music divine. The owner amiable. Everything was perfect here. My only complaint would be the price which without a Groupon would be much to pricy to frequent too often. Go here for the experience of a lifetime,2
"While the staff was friendly and the service very good, the prices seemed steep for what we ate. The lobster roll was very small in proportion to others I've eaten around the city, and overwhelmed by the massive fries! Crab perogies were a good portion, but bland. Beer selection was great, and ambiance was cozy.very warm inside that day.felt sorry for our waitress.",1
"This was my first visit to this Starbucks. There wasn't a line in the drive thru, yet it took almost 5 minutes for them to make my mocha. I will give them another shot, but so far I am not impressed. I also agree with the other review that the drive thru set up could lead to major traffic problems. As I was pulling out of the drive thru, a SUV almost backed into me.",1
"This truly is AS GOOD AS IT GETS! The bread pudding is properly entitled ""Slap Your Momma "".it is DELICOUS The seafood gumbo is delightful and the fried catfish is perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. To top it off the customer service you receive is outstanding! Please take the time to try this place it out.it is definitely worth the time and consideration bestLousianastylefoodinVegas!",2
"Cheapest hotel I could find in the Madison area. Checking in and out was quick, employees were nice enough, the bed was comfy, the room was clean, and they even had a continental breakfast. The air conditioning unit was pretty loud so I turned it off at night. I also recommend bringing your own pillow. Still, I've stayed at worse, and at 50 a night, the price is unbeatable.",2
"I hadn't been to this VI for a while but recently went back. New management has really turned this place around. I went in only expecting a mediocre meal and left surprised at how much we enjoyed our meal. Had an omlet, pancakes and a piece of pie. I normally wouldn't give a place like this 4 stars but I was honestly impressed with the food.",2
"THIS PLACE SUCKS! The food is fair, the prices are outrageous for a neighborhood place think Rao's or Valentino's . They charge 30 for corkage and have a terrible wine list, don't honor reservations and close early all the time. The owner can't even legally use his name, Piero, because he cheated one of his former partners and got sued. Really not worth the effort.",1
"Have eaten MANY times Flemings. Only sat in the bar at the South Scottsdale location, but sat in the dining room last weekend. From the time we sat down and cold air was blowing on us, it was a disaster. Still have GC for them so will use it up at DC Ranch location which has much better dining room service.",1
"this place is some what dumpy. the room looks like it hasn't been updated since the 80's, but it was fairly clean. the casino itself gets no ventilation. positive thing is the hotel is located on the middle of the strip. if you want a cheap room that is on the middle of the strip, then it's not too bad. just don't hang out there.",1
"We always have a great experience here and it's great to see the same smiling faces address you. Everyone we deal with has a great attitude. It's clean. Just love Costco. They also have a great return policy, the handful of times I've had to return anything over the years. They make it very easy to deal with them.",2
"Hello Rocky Point tacos! That's right, I was driving by this place looking for a used car in a tougher part of town and could not pass trying out their carne asada tacos. It was just like street tacos. The service is normal, the atmosphere is what is expected see picture , the food was pretty cheap. Don't take your date here but if you are having a craving for street tacos you should stop by.",2
"I disagree with the fellow two reviewers, smoothies are here to stay. Think about it, after a late night shouting over music and filling your body with a mammoth amount of intoxicants, the last thing you want down your throat in the morning is anything solid. Sure it tastes the same like Gavin said, but it pretty much covers your 5 a day if you get the right combo.",2
"If you are a big fan of Monta or Ramen Sora, this place doesn't quite meet your expectations. Everything from the food to service was average or needed a lot of work. Needless to say, if you live on the east side of town I definitely respect the practicality of frequenting this place to have your ramen fix, but I'd say the trip to Monta or Ramen Sora will be worth it in the end.",1
"Came for an old fashion In N Out burger. The employees were joking around and not working promptly to get my order out. On top of all this there was no place to sit inside, not because it was busy, but because there was trash all over the tables. We decided to eat outside, no big deal. I come outside to bird shirt on my table.",1
"We had a nice dinner and a few drinks. The food was good and Steffi, our waitress, was great. One of the patrons, a regular, I think, was way out of control, and nearly caused an unpleasant confrontation with us. Management stepped in and did the right thing by us, so we have to applaud them for that.",2
Insert Coins is definitely a fun place and a cool idea. I wish it was less club like and kept their drink prices a little lower. I understand that going out is a different experience for most people than it is for me. This place is more about being seen with the cool kids than what I would call an authentic good time. So if you're into it you can have a couple 10 drinks and be like the kids on TV.,2
I have only graced this shop recently as a friend advised that they do brilliant sales and i wasn't disappointed. Everything was diamante encrusted and glittery. Very appealing to someone my ages and especially to teenagers. I left with 4 bras and 5 pairs of pants for a total of u00a320. Result! Maybe not the classiest underwear sets but definitely good quality.,2
"I have been ordering from this location for years now and they have never disappointed. Although I couldn't give full 5 stars and that's not the store fault, its Dominos as a company. they would not allow a gift card purchase on the Dominos App. Still pizza is always tasty and delivery is always earlier than expected!",2
Slowest service I've had in a long time and the sushi wasn't anything special. It was over 30 minutes from the time we sat down until the first of 3 rolls showed up at our table.with only 8 total customers in the whole place. Their prices aren't horrible but they're not worth the wait when there are a half dozen better sushi options within a few miles of here.,1
"This place is horrible! Where to begin.the produce is rotten, the jars of food have dents in them and their selection is awful. I think that the place is run by 14 year old kids because that's all I see when I am forced to shop there because I have no other options. I'd rather visit the Rite Aid down the street for emergencies or wait to go to another place off the mountain.",1
"Horrible service. Horrible food at a high price. Stopped in to try this place for breakfast. Got an egg sandwich with avocado and tomato. This cost me 8.01, after waiting ten minutes too long my order came. After getting to work they had forgotten my tomato. Leaving me question how a 6.40 egg sandwich ended up being a 8.01 piece of garbage. Never again.",1
"What can I say I love this place! We've been enjoying Buzzberry consistently for about 4 years. I come every morning for a super secret menu extra large blackberry iced tea. The breakfast burrito is great, great coffee. Recently we tried the pulled pork dinner, also good. Love supporting a local place in the neighborhood and especially a dog friendly one. oh and Kate is awesome!",2
"Excellent place. Great vibe and great food! For appetizers we had the fried green tomatoes, corn bread and blue cheese chips. All were excellent. My favorite was definitely the corn bread. For the entree I had the crab cake. I was NOT expecting it to be lump crab meat so it was a pleasant surprise. You will not be disappointed!",2
This place got me again. They packed our party of 4 in like sardines and raped us of our money. Why can't they just charge more for a ticket and not actively try to screw you over once you get in the door? I would gladly pay more for a ticket if I were guaranteed a good seat that isn't on somebody's lap and wasn't forced to pay 5 for water.,1
"This subterranean joint is cozy and elegant, and amazingly spacious. They are renowned for their cocktails, and we had some flaming smoking whiskey delight that tickled my tastebuds and had me reeling. Nice bar staff, cute patrons, and all themed as a barber shop run by a family of pandas if I got that right. nGood times.",2
I don't see how anyone would give this anything less than a 5 star. The pizza is the best in the city! The Fresh Ricotta and Prosciutto are always good but all others are worth a shot. We tried the Leek pizza and the Spicy Cacciatore.absolutely amazing. I have a daughter with me at all time and they're always very accommodating to us. This place is definitely one of my favorites!,2
"I really like the ribs and shrimp jammers at this locale. Full rack of ribs is enough for two meals, nShrimp jammers are jalape u00f1os filled with shrimp, cheese, breaded and fried nNot health food, definitely yummy Bartenders are always friendly. HH drinks are good The Henderson locale has a very different menu, not bad but different.",2
"I am not sure who is ready to give 5 stars to this place. I spend about 5 hours at this UMC ""quick care "" and left with a medication that I was on and did not work on me for the same condition. I have a big bill coming in every week and I dont know for what. This place looks like a scam. I woul d rather prefer going to CVS ot walgreen clinic. Thanks",1
"Their sauce is terrible. I like the fact that you can order online, but aside from that, the pizza is nothing to write home about. In my area, there are other places that are better like Tony's the best. Pronto Pizza, and Mamma's pizza. Being from NY, maybe I'm biased. ok, I definitely am. but skip Papa John's and go for a local mom and pop place. MUCH better pizza even if they don't deliver.",1
"The food here was great! Wish there was more indoor seating, but the seating both indoor and outside is nice, live music sometimes, nice decor. I've tried a few of the specialty drinks, some are good some are so so but isn't it always that way? Just preferences. The prices are a bit high, but the portions are worth it, we can split a meal typically. The Deserts are awesome too!",2
"I really enjoyed the freshest onion rings on this planet and I liked the pretzel bun that came on my burger. Nice atmosphere. Cool, casual and contemporary place to hang out and chill with friends. Im looking forward to returning for the live jazz on weekends. at least I thought it was jazz, I could be wrong ",2
"Seriously, how does a casino in Vegas go bankrupt? They have every advantage over the gambler. And this one has a prime location. The executives here must be as clueless as the boys from ""The Office "". They're not spending all that lost money on renovations. I've seen Chipotles with nicer interiors. This haunted house is open all year long.",1
I come here every time I go to Vegas. I recommend this place highly. I always get the 1 2 pound chews and bacon burger with myshrooms on the side. they tend to make the burger bun wet so input on after wards. But a solid choice in the strip. I actually saw pharrel roll in here with a bunch of guys and girls at 5 am Friday night. It was crazy!,2
"I will never bring my Shih Zhus to this place again. Avoid Holly! She has caused one of my dogs a trip to the Vet after 2 separate groomings. First, a hot spot for cutting the hair too short on his scrotum and an eye injury for cutting the hair to short around his eye. The Manager didn't even offer to do anything for my trouble. A 140.88 Vet bill nor the 40 cost of the poorly done grooming.",1
"Absolutely. Terrible. It took 2 hours to get our food, our server was rude and non communicative. Apparently the computer system was down and the kitchen was backed up how that explains a surly server I'll never know. Also, how it explains a luke warm mimosa I don't know either. Bleh. Don't waste your time.",1
"Came here with a group of my girlfriends on a Friday night. Right when we walked in, people looked at us as of they hadn't seen Asian girls before. Our waitress Kristen was really nice though and their dj was spinning decent hip hop. 1 star for no cover charge for women. 2nd star for my Blue Moon on tap.",1
My husband and I had a great dinner here. I had the pork osso buco and he had the pasta trio. Both were fabulous! The quiet atmosphere and attentive service were a nice treat after several meals at other local restaurants that were very noisy and crowded. The wine list was impressive and the waiter was helpful recommending wine.,2
"Service was great, atmosphere was cool. The food was lighter thaormal Mexican but still tasted authentic. I'm big on beans and rice and chips and salsa. This place was excellent with all 3. The food is also really well priced. I got a two taco plate 1 veggie and 1 shrimp. Both were light and tasty. The portion sizes were not oversized which I actually appreciated. Will definitely come back.",2
"Tried to place an order today for delivery and asked for the lettuce on the side. I have ordered a sandwich in the past with lettuce on it, by the time it reached my house it was a soggy mess and completely unappetizing. I was told they cannot put anything on the side due to company policy. Major disappointment. Won't eat there again. I gave it a second chance and they failed me again. I'm done.",1
"It's subway. There isn't much else to say. The employees always look dead inside. It has that fake fresh bread smell just like all the subway locations. I usually end up going here when I go to blockbuster and smell that sickly addicting smell for 10 minutes while browsing for a movie. I'm almost always disappointed, but overall you can do worse in the fast food realm.",1
"New fast casual dining spot, that let's you choose what goes on your plate. Healthy eating can be a snap by dining here and the flavors have so much to offer in the way of zip and zing. Falafel, baba ghanoush, tabouli, gyro, shawarma and soups all ready to go when you hit the line. Stop in and give it a try their customer service is stellar!",2
"Absolutely love this place! The owners are super nice and always greet you when you walk in. They always offer water and make sure your comfortable. The pedicure chairs are very comfortable and relaxing. I've been coming here since they opened and I absolutely love it. I always get the same thing, but they always do an amazing job.",2
This is by far the best nail salon in the area. I go in every 2 weeks to get a manicure pedicure and make my appointment ahead of time as it can get pretty busy. My favorite technician is Julie. She always does an excellent job of my nails and is very conversant. Beverages are always offered and they seem to really care about their customers.,2
"Excellent location and great service. You can tell the therapists love working here and they do great massages. nWhen I got into the room Kurt asked what kind of massage I wanted, pressure and type. My back was killing me when I went in, and it has felt great since. I will be back again in two weeks. thank you!",2
"For the Westin, this place stinks, literally. When I walk in the room s , it has that very musky smoked in room. The bar downstairs is good though, always happening. If I wasn't such an SPG points whore, I would never stay here. Word is that they will be getting a renovation soon.it is sorely needed.",1
"I love the GFM! They have some of the best vendors! The vendors there are not pushy and many offer samples. I haven't been here in the fall months, but I've heard there are many more vendors than the summer. The location has great parking, is nice and open, and next to a little sitting play area for kids. It is my Saturday morning ritual to head there!",2
I get my toes and nails done by Heather. nHer pedicure includes a wonderful leg and foot massage. What I most appreciate is that my polished toes last a good 6 weeks before I need to call her again for another one. She works Wednesday through Saturday and will accept walk ins if she's not booked . I like this salon environment.,2
"Poor service, been waiting for my check for 30min! Still waiting after asking another server for it. Yay, finally, someone else dropped it off, what happened to our server?! Left hungry and feel everything was overpriced. Sad because I never right bad reviews but this was not a good first experience.",1
"It's Denny's. It has food. It's really cheap if you order off the 2 4 6 menu. I wouldn't recommend it, although the service was fine, but then again, getting eight people to agree on anything that early when they're hungover leads to some Denny's type experiences. So go, just know it'll be just like the last time you went to Denny's.",1
"The pastries are pretty solid, atmosphere was great kitschy amp cute. But I was not impressed by the cupcakes. I tried the vanilla vanilla. It was dry, very heavy, topped with too sweet vanilla frosting, and one too many sprinkles. All in all. Great for a morning pastry, but lacking in the cupcake department.",1
Not even worth 1 star! This location is SLOW! I waited in a packed drive thru for a half an hour until I got my meal. I come here a few times a week and my order is usually wrong. It seems like the people that work here are more interested in having fun with each other then actually doing their job. After today I have made the decision ever to eat here again.,1
"I was craving a salmon bagel a couple of weeks ago, so my hubs stopped here to get me one instead of driving all the way to Bruggers. Well, not a lot of people order those from the Big Apple in Tega Cay. The salmon was old and had a mealy texture. It was a to go order or I would hv most definitely requested a refund. Wont be going back for that. Maybe a plain bagel.",1
I love this store. Its the best in the country. Excellent customer service anytime . great quality stuff becit food or clothes or electronics. Gas prices are a boon. But a tip if you are living close to Ballantyne or within Charlotte get ur gas from south Carolina Walmart.India land. Cheaper than Costco,2
" This review is for Las Vegas ie The Strip Went to Las Vegas on the weekend for a friends 30th B'day celebration. It quickly dawned on me that LV is everything I hate about the USA in one location. Mindless gambling drones, drunk red neck frat boys at 2 in the afternoon, plastic barbies, the excess of it all. The one star is for the flight home.",1
"It isn't often that I am compelled to write a review, but this place actually exceeded my expectations! The chicken and waffles were absolutely perfect as was my side of mac n' cheese. They have a simple concept really good food, done well, with good service, that isn't pretentious or over priced. I can't wait to go back! ",2
"I'm a value sorta guy.considering that, I should HATE this place on paper, but the quality, selection of items you won't find other places, and general vibe of the store are fantastic. You will pay top dollar, but you get top notch stuff in return! Their baked goods are exquisite, their meats are the most gorgeous chunks of dead flesh you'll ever see, and then. there's the Beer Wine. Wow.",2
"I really enjoyed this restaurant and have been there several times. This time service was slow slow slow in the bar. Could have been that we were seated next to a giant party. Other wise ambiance is fantastic, love the music.the decor. Service is friendly. Make a reservation if you can as this place fills up fast!",2
"If you like sweet starbucks drinks you will LOVE this place. They have a great selection of drinks you can order either hot, iced, or blended. And they are cheaper than starbucks too! Even if the line is a little bit long they are quick. And the staff is beyond friendly. I swear they must seriously love their job! I would recommend the annihilator.",2
"The owner, Andrea, is a fabulous wealth of knowledge. If you don't see a particular wine, ask. She might be able to get it. She also carries a great selection of wines starting at about 11 and up. The store has some beers and ciders too! Friday is Wine Tasting Night for 15 a flight, you keep the glass and Saturday is 10 a flight. I'd recommend checking them out.",2
iI recently ate at Ricardo's there were very few patrons. My fajitas were served with sour beef full of fat. My friends food was cold. nThe service was less than standard. When finished the waiter never removed any of the plates. nHe was sure to tell us when paying with a credit card about leaving at least a 15 tip!,1
"Only went cause friends invited. Next time I will politly tell friends they are on there own. Seriously, Realy how hard is it to cook a steak MEDIUM WELL, for them impossible. Steak came out RARE they took back and cooked more, still not done. Thanks for reinforcing your nickname CRAPPLEBEES! You guys are not worth my money anymore, what a JOKE. Good For NOTHING",1
"My last and final comments on the matter I gave them credit for being honest, however with that comes with FILLING THE OBLIGATIONS you make during our call. Clearly, once you thought I was placated you simple slid me back over into the ignore pile. Shame on you Upward Projects. It wasn't that HARD just do what you say your going to do, less people will get angry if you do. Lance",1
"For valentines day we decided to come to tanzy after a movie. The place is decorated nicely and has a huge bar so it's great to eat your meal there. We had the tuna tar tar and the beef carpaccio was was delicious. It's not too pricy either so if you're looking for a great meal before running to Ipic, id say you can't go wrong with tanzy.",2
"First off, let me say that I'm very impressed with all aspects of both the Venetian and the Palazzo. Everything except for one thing they added 2.60 to each of my drinks at the pool without listing such a charge on the receipt. I'm not one to cry over spilled milk, but it's just a little sheisty, no? A 12 bloody mary with a standard 1 tip somehow shows up as a 15.60 drink. Thanks, Palazzo!",1
"Nothing special i had better fries plain bland nothing special nspecial sauce had better ntoast so so nsweet tea very good only thing worth while on the menu nchicken fingers two words ""child please "" nasty cashier no comment nI will not be returning sn good thing Chick Fil A isn't in town, because you would be put out of business",1
"Stay away! This place is horrible. Some of the worst service I have ever received. Unfortunately, this is the only place for us to get warranty work done. As soon as we can get everthing fixed, we will never be back. nIf you still choose to do business with these folks, don't say you weren't warned. You will be sorry.",1
"I stopped going here and went back to Ray's. They are too vulgar and don't consider or respect women and children. The last time I went they were listening to an uncensored Mike Jones CD. Pretty bad lyrics to have playing in a business. The guys are cool, but need some maturity and consideration for customers.",1
Getting old ! There are plenty of solid alternatives for pizza in montreal so one must constantly be on top his game in order to remain relevant. Service also requires a review and basic pleasantries are lacking here. I give it 2 stars as I have had good pizza here in yester years and I hope this place can turn it around.,1
"The burgers are great here, but I really come for the atmosphere. I appreciate that Corbin's built from the ground up in my neighborhood and gave us a restaurant with real style modern, sleek and yet comfortable. Here's a tip If you like pickled cauliflower, ask if they'll give you just a little more. It's delicious.",2
"Delicious! Margaritas are actual margaritas, no mix just like juice. They're strong but good. So many choices of tequila! The tacos and buffalo wings were really good too. The only thing is that it took a while to get our waiter to take our order but other than that I really liked it and will come back again.",2
"Ive been to like 503 Autozones here in Vegas, this one is not my fave. Theyre not as professional and not really helpful. I asked a question and they just looked at me stupid, then I asked about their return policy and it seemed like they were gonna die if I returned the unused product! Negative! Next time Im gonna show them the strong arm!",1
"We got ripped off! I went here last Saturday night. The price in the menu for hookah is 25. When we went to pay our tab, the owner said it was 20 each, including the person in our party who did not smoke and only had water. Not only were we deceived about pricing, the service was mediocre, if not below average. Don't come here.",1
Best burgers in town! They are fresh and super quick. Why go to some fast food place like Burger King or McDonalds and get some crap on a bun when you can get a fresh quality hamburger here exactly how you want it? I do think the inside is pretty boring though and don't care for the 80's music they play but it's worth it to overlook that and eat some tasty meat.,2
"I've had my share of Margaritas and I must admit that these are the best in town. However, the new Glendale locatioeeds to catch up on the quality of Margaritas as the ones they serve at their parent location 16th street and McDowell . I have faith that they will as they begin to settle down at their new location.",2
"Excellent value and service. Over the last 15 years have had 8 cars tinted by them with nary a problem. What one issue we had was on an 8 year old job that Mark, the owner, stood behind and fixed no problems or questions asked. Cars are always done with appointment and ready same day. Inside the car and outside are in the same condition as when I left the car with them.",2
"Mediocre Mexican food. The only thing that I really enjoy here are the sopapias hot and fresh with a little bit of honey. Other than that the food is just your typical concoction of rice,beans,guacamole, tortilla corn and flour and some form of meat. This place is located inside the Palms Hotel and Casino which makes it trendy and jacks up the prices significantly.",1
"The only banh mi I thought I had had before was in a tapas restaurant.so it was a small portion and I now realize wasn't truly banh mi and I really had no idea what it was. Until I had Lucy's it was FANTASTIC! The bread was delicious, the sauce, everything. I don't get to the Strip very often but I'm already trying to figure out when I can get back there and have another one!",2
"Employees are friendly. Coffee is decent. Prices are good. BUT THE WIFI IS AWFUL, and that's the main reason I leave my house for coffee. I really wish their connectivity was better because I would make the extended drive past three Starbucks and one other coffee house to go to It's A Grind, but not until they fix their WiFi.",1
"I love this store! So much they know me by name and if there isn't a line I'll sit and shoot the shit with the employees! Haha! That's how shopping should be. Like Cheers! You'll find everything you need here. And like other stores, things you don't need to! good store, stocked, nice employees. Sorry, it's a CVS, I can't write a ""real "" review. You get what you get here, a drugstore! ",2
"How do I miss such a good sandwich for all these years?! Ok here's the skinny. Awesome hot sandwiches, great price and served up pretty quick. Cons inconveniently located in Miracle Mile shops. No real ambiance or quite seating. Needs a location for locals in Summerlin or Henderson. The fact that you can pop in at 4am and get a great hot sandwich on the strip for 6.awesome!",2
Hubby loves this place.I however do not really care too much for it. The curries are too sweet and their stirfry's are always packed with too much cabbage! and I mean raw cabbage. I also don't understand how they expect us to eat dry stirfry with rice. We eat here if hubby has serious thai food hankering and I have decided to stick with their noodles which are actually decent.,1
We love burgers and apparently so do they! I ordered the BBQ burger and enjoyed it on their patio. It was delicious and the fries were great too. The service was standard exemplary quick and easy. The restaurant is clean and the patio has the right mix of shade and sunlight on an early fall afternoon.,2
"Yay, finally remembered to come back! this place is so close to work it is a shame I had forgotten about it. nVery friendly service, and. I went for a Gyro Pita, with salad. It was very tasty, lots of meat. I even had some left overs for a late snack at work. Hubby got the Gyro Pita too, with fries. Really good too. Looking forward to go back, hopefully soon ",2
"I was in town for a wedding and we booked hair updos there and manis and my friend also got a pedi. I was very happy with the service. Staff are super nice and friendly and our updos came out great! Also, they squeezed me in for a mani last minute thank God! Because my nails were a mess. Nice place to go !",2
"Don't stay on the first floor, you hear every footstep and door closing from the second floor. The free breakfast is nothing special, after looking at the horde of people waiting for a waffle we decided to just go out to eat. Also, bring your own pillow unless you're into shoebox sized pillows. Other than those issues the accommodations were ok.",1
Great local gaming bar. Plenty of seating and pool tables if the machines take your money though. Just hit 4 Aces with the kicker a few nights ago and always get great service from Stevo. Separate restaurant for non smokers and a digital juke box makes Remedy's one of my favorite spots. Actually partied here on Christmas and they made a great ham with all the fixings.,2
"Nice space, great vintage and new apparel Veronica the owner is very friendly and customer service orientated in a good way! I bought the most adorable vintage brown leather handbag with built in lipstick mirror.ooh! it was love at first sight. They're on the west side of the street, just south of Highland.",2
"My wife and I frequent this El Pollo. The quality of food is always very high. The service is quick and courteous. When we are ieed of some flavorful grilled chicken and fresh made salsa they do not disappoint. If you have not tried the stuffed quesadillas, they are full of chicken, avocado and amassing sauce.",2
EPIC hotel from top to bottom. If you have the money you will not be disappointed with the Wynn. Remote control window coverings the service top notch. Why only 4 stars ? if you're a working man who like to dress a little casual you will feel out place almost looked down upon. a bit too snooty for my working class lifestyle,2
"I have nothing against Capezio products, however regardless of location the prices are always over the top. This store is always disorganized with products sliding off the racks and exceedingly snotty and arrogant customer service. Rude. Bad selection. Discount Dance is by far a better choice. 1 star is generous.",1
"Support small business and shop at Posh Daisie. Owned by a local Las Vegas family, they take the time to get to know all of their customers. They have items at every price point if you are looking for a gift for someone. They also started carrying the cutest baby items. I always swing by Posh Daisie when I want a new outfit.",2
"Ate here on friday 10 4, after seeing it on diners drive in and dives. We had the oxtail chili cheese fries, the ronin and the kalbi burger. It was honestly one of the best meals ive ever had in my life! Growing up in hawaii, it really had a lot of local flavors that I missed! The service was great too!",2
" ""Udder "" disappointment. Really had high hopes for this place. Ice cream was good. Service was terrible. It was super slow so no reason for poor service. Every table was dirty and sticky. No excuse for this as it was not busy at all. Young guy behind the counter was more interested in talking with his friend than making it a good experience for the customer. Won't be back!",1
"I love their pho! The only place i would get pho and the fact that they are open 24 hrs is a plus.but i seriously dislike their staff! Ive been going to this place for a very long time and their staff has always been very rude! It would be nice if they could at least crack a smile when servicing you. Other than that, service is pretty quick, atmosphere is inviting, pho never seems to dissapoint!",2
"We ate here awhile ago and the food was 3 star good. The reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because of this dessert. I don't remember what's it called, but it's like a little pillow of dough that is kind of like a pita. But, it's sweet. And when you drizzle some honey on top of it, it's even sweeter! And not just sugary sweet, but Eric Cartman ""Sweet! """,2
"I've been here twice, and both times the service was terrible. It took 20 minutes to even get service. My pho came before my water and tea, and my water refill didn't come for 10 minutes. The small soup is extremely small. Pho mailan close to this place is way better, super fast, and the portions and veggies are much more plentiful. I will not be returning here.",1
"Finding good bubble tea in Pittsburgh is not easy, but this place does well with theirs. I like that they have the option of green tea jelly, it different. I just wish they had coffee jelly. They also sell Korean chicken, which I haven't tried. They just need more workers or blenders. One worker on the register and one making drinks to speed things along. Next time you're in Oakland try it out!",2
"Good beer, decent food but thats not why you go, close to campus, and a great way to end the day. Definitely enjoyed a happy hour or two especially after a long day or week of school. Its really nice to sit outside and just hang out or people watch. Casey's certainly can attract an interesting bunch. All in all a solid place to drink and hang out.",2
"the food was good, the service could have been better. we enjoyed the music some things you havent heard on the radio in years, where being played so it was nice. what i didnt like, every few min people would scream and i mean SCREAM the waiters were egging on a crowd in the back to get loud, and after a long day of walking around the strip and just wanting a good meal this kind of ruined it.",1
"This was my first time eating here. The food was delicious, but it was a very small serving size for a 1 2 sandwich. I got the 1 2 turkey and Brie sandwich and cup of asparagus, leek and spinach soup. The 1 2 sandwich was smaller than my phone at about 3 inches long. The price was 6.59 for such a small serving. While delicious, it was not worth it. I won't be back.",1
"I love this place. My second time there, was lucky enough to go on a Groupon. It is small and quaint with a secret find type of atmosphere. We had the 2 pizza's and a calzone. The calzone is the best I ever had and I'm from NY and don't really even love them . The Edna pizza arugula, proscuitto, and shaved parm reggiano is wonderful. Great crust, everything is just YUMMY!",2
"These sandwiches are so good, I would be willing to sit outside on those 115 degree days Phoenix supposedly gets, if that was the only way I could enjoy them. Combine it with Cowboy Ciao in Scottsdale and Cafe Elote in Sedona, and we pretty much had the perfect AZ food trifecta. Bonus points for meeting Chris Bianco behind the counter. Yeah, I guess this place is named after him.",2
"Fabulous pizza and wait staff, including Ami, our server, they were excellent. She made sure, twice, that our pizza was cooked perfectly I like extra crispy . My friends and I ate here last night, on a Saturday, and they were overly accommodating. They have a full bar, good weekend happy hour specials all day, and a nice out door patio. It was so scrumptious last night I came for lunch today.",2
We ate there in January and the staff is rude and slow! We thought that we would give it another try on the way to work today and OMG! nWalked in this morning and it stunk to high heaven! The hostess was not nice whatsoever. We sat for a minute and just couldn't stand the smell so we walked out. nWe have eaten at other locations and love the food and service. But not at this one.,1
"This has been pretty much a weekly lunch destination for me and my coworkers. A couple of our favorites Crunchy tofu extra crunchy nSpicy pork spring mix bowl nSpicy pork ramen The owner does seasonal ramens and dishes, I recommend trying them. we have not been disappointed yet. Great place to go for Japanese Korean food. The flavors are very consistent.",2
"I ordered Pesaro's last week and it was great. I know a lot of other people have had bad experiences, but I really loved it. We got a large pizza with black olives and extra cheese. It was cooked perfectly, delicious and it got here in a reasonable amount of time with no problems. I'll try it again soon and hope that my opinion doesn't change!",2
"I ate here once while Crudo was still in its Scottsdale location. And I raved about it and vowed to come back although the strange location in a salon delayed that return . Then Crudo disappeared. And I wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in Phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies. Now it has reappeared, and in a better location. Oh joy.",2
An uptown pizzeria with delicious food and great atmosphere. The Parlor is more urban feeling than their downtown cousins though achieves a more family style friendly atmosphere. We enjoy their menu salads and pizzas but always order our own custom concoction as well as a selection of meats and cheeses from their create your own menu.,2
Had take foe here a fee weeks ago. Burger was great. Bun was fresh and meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Fries on the other had were a different story. I had the fresh cut fries and they were undercooked to my likening. Next time I go back ill either order the shoestring fries or get the fresh cut ones again but request they be cooked well done.,2
"We went for the first time and sat at the sushi bar, we constantly had servers reaching over us to pick up sushi orders for other guest which was very annoying. then one of the servers poured soy sauce all over my wife and I. All we got was I am sorry, didn't seem to even care so this must happen a lot.wont be back.",1
"Nice atmosphere. Rooftop is nice but there are no umbrellas and there is no shade, so you can't comfortably sit there in the heat of the day. The food is pretty bland. The calamari was flavorless. The salmon burger I had was just ok. Everyone at my table felt that the food was bland. They do have nice drink specials, which is a plus.",1
I hate dealing with banks. I cannot stress this enough I hate dealing with banks. But at least this bank has a great manager Brendon anytime I have a issue he resolves it fast. He is always there to help you out so if you are looking for a great place to have a banking relation ship I would try this location.,2
"Compared to other Starbucks in the area, this is one I usually avoid unless I need to get on the freeway right after. Pretty slow service, drinks are mediocre. But what does it for me is that it's never a welcoming experience here and the employees make me want to leave quicker than they can serve coffee!",1
This place has gone downhill fast. Since the workforce shake down service is terrible and slow which is too bad since my wife is a regular there. I went with her today and frankly ill be surprised if this location makes it. As a side not ill be surprised if Danny himself can stay of if jail! Try a different car wash chain,1
"Great buffet. All the food tasted good. The service was excellent. They did offer all you can drink wine for 7, which I didn't take at the time. The portions are small but you don't have to waste anything, which you shouldn't. The gelatos were bomb. I didn't like the other pastries and I didn't taste the chocolate dip strawberries. This is the spot.",2
"God these guys are so rude. It's like, it's not enough you're overpriced but basic phone and customer service manners are non existent. Called them with a simple request after regretfully spending 1200 on a BBQ from these dbags and the hillbilly who answered the phone was next level rude do yourself a favor, go somewhere else.",1
"Their employees are the rudest human beings alive. The host are rude and act like they own the joint and the manager Errol is the biggest jerk ever. Whatever happened to customer service and pleasing guest. They clearly have no mission they are following at this Sugar Factory in particular, the one in Town Square is def. better!",1
We are here at the pub and came to order the yard of beer we ordered last time and they no longer have those here. That was what made them better than all the other places around here in the hotel. And the food just wasn't good and the beer was barely even colder than room temperature. Won't be coming back here in the near future. That is for sure,1
"Your seizure inducing commercial is LITERALLY one of the most annoying things to come on the TV, so much so that I had a sudden urge to pummel the idiot who made it in the face, upon realizing that is probably impossible, I actually took the time to turn on my computer, log onto yelp, and write this review, THAT is how irritating your commercial is.",1
"Overpriced hipster doofus sports bar. nThe oyster and beer Friday's you see referenced on Tripadvisor, etc do not even exist. The dismissive waitress said they never ever had such a thing, like we made it up. nIf you want to go to a cool sports bar on the strip go to The Pub at the Monte Carlo. Great beer selection, great happy hour and if you want, you can sit on the deck with a view of the pool.",1
Great prices! Great hotdogs! They have good a c a good place for kids BUT The restrooms are ALWAYS nasty they stink they are full of toilet paper over flowing the whole entire flore is wet in the restroom! Effin NASTY! So as long as u have no need to use there restroom ruin your shoes it's a good place it enjoy a movie with friends n family!,1
"The epitome of a crap chain. Why did I get talked into going here? Because I am a tool. Crowded, loud, mediocre food, slow service, and on this particular occasion a strange man two tables down and across the aisle staring at me and not his dining companion, during the entire meal. I should have just yelled, ""watch my head spin "" and vomited there at the table.",1
Awesome Hawaiian style food and great salads! The salted caramel chocolate coconut bark is so good! The burritos are great and it is so easy to order. Great place to stop on our road trip. We will defiantly go to this restaurant again when we drive through Las Vegas and the staff was so friendly! 5 stars!,2
"One of the bests hot yoga studios in Montreal. The classes and teachers are great, the changing rooms are soooo spacious including plenty of shower cabins, finally! and it's right next to the Peel metro station. A bit pricey but all yoga studios are anyways. Try the intro week you're going to love this place!",2
"Usually great, the guy who starts the sandwich decided I didn't matter once he saw a customer he recognized. I ended up being skipped to get the regulars better service. Told the cashier that isn't good service and I probably won't come back. She was polite, apologized offered freebies. I turned them down, hope they learn to treat people with equally good service and respect.",1
"I love this cleaning company! I have only used them for a few months but already am a fan of their friendly and caring staff, their attention to detail, and their professionalism. Cleaning reports, check in's, and surprise inspections are things that separates this cleaning company from the rest. Thank you!",2
"You know that gross taste way too old iced tea has ? Well that is what i got from here. I know if that happens they aren't fallowing their labeling and dumping the old stuff rules. Most McDonald's don't have that problem. Also the hubby ordered an iced coffee and it had like 5 ice cubes, warm iced coffee yuck !",1
"I'm writing this review mainly to say that this location is now CLOSED. Which is quite sad, not to mention perplexing, why TJ's would close one of their best stocked and busy TJ's in the valley. Not a good move, in my opinion to force West Phoenix customers to drive either out to Arrowhead, 20th st Camelback, or various other locations in Tempe and Scottsdale. Bad business decision, in my opinion.",1
"We were next door having dinner and finally had our first cool evening in months. Walked over and were greeted by exceptionally friendly staff. I went into the humidor and not a huge selection, but all the best sellers I'm sure. I picked 3 stogies and we all sat outside and had a wonderful time smoking and listening to the Jazz band. The place is worth the stop.",2
"I don't get it. This was probably the most un Thai like Thai food I've ever had. I had a lunch special. Red curry with some fried things resembling eggroll and wontons, some steamed rice and some really nice lemongrassy soup. The soup was the only thing I enjoyed. The curry was.bland. Bland.Thai.food. I can't imagine much worse in culinary sins.",1
"Beware of these folks on Groupon. We bought a groupon for these call several times with no answer and finally got an appointment several weeks out. Despite calling yesterday to no answer of course to attempt to confirm appointment, they are a no show for the appointed day time for the car detailing.",1
"Ordered delivery from this place tonight. It took over 90 minutes estimated 45 60 . The food wasn't hot, the rice was just blah, they didn't bring our eggrolls. So on their delivery service NO stars on the food itself hard to tell honestly it didn't seem to be what we ordered as was described on the online menu. Maybe they were just having a bad night but it'll be a while before we try again.",1
This is my go to Hotel in Las Vegas. The suites are big and have 2 bathrooms. Nicely furnished in a subdued neutral color palette. nI'm surprised I forgot to review this place before have stayed here so many times! It is nice to be close to Mandalay for the Sports Book or convention but I like that THEhotel is quiet. The Mandalay Beach Spa are great and I use them every time I stay there.,2
California Pizza Kitchen is corporate food at its best. The restaurant has a pizza oven and the wide selection of pizzas are all made by hand with fresh ingredients. The bar is well stocked an faces and somewhat entertaining in that it faces the open pizza kitchen. Simply a great place to get a well made pizza and craft beer.,2
I've only been here once but their noodles are handmade and super fresh. I love the broth they use as well. Whenever I eat noodles I usually have headaches from the sodium levels but I haven't had any issues here. You should also try their green tea dessert tray. We ordered two cause it was that good.,2
My hubby and I love this place. We look forward to going. We have even taken the dog and sat outside on the patio. The Pizza has a thin crispy crust and the toppings are great. We love the Mediterranean salad and we add fresh mozzarella. It is a little pricey but it is well worth it. Hubby also loves that they have Peroni beer on tap. We have always got wonderful service.,2
"My partner took an cello to this store to sell, the staff where friendly efficient. We had come up from Durham stayed over night locally, the store allowed us to park at the rear of the shop as parking is so bad in Edinburgh. Instument was sold fairly quickly. Communication was lacking on occasions but overall worth the 4 stars.",2
"I was on vacation in Las Vegas, and I wanted a break from the over priced food in the strip so this place was a much needed break. At first I was a little skeptical, but wow this place was delicious and the staff was very friendly! The proportions are huge! I ate the best pancakes I've ever had, no syrup needed. Overall, the next time I'm in Vegas, the Omelet House will be 1 on my list!",2
"I have been using creature comforts since I moved to Charlotte 3 years ago. With the new transition of owners it was seamless and Mark is just as wonderful as Matt! It's hard enough leaving an animal at home but with Mark, rest assured your pets are in greaT hands. He sends pics along with each. Visit and updated me each time. My dog and I are very pleased! Over the top!",2
"This place used to be ok years ago but has gone wayyy down hill. The food is not good anymore. Ordered corned beef hash recently, worst I ever had. Service is very poor. Theres plenty of good breakfast places in the valley to go instead. Their pancakes might be the only thing good on the menu, but its not worth going.",1
"Sometimes they have additional 30, 40 or 50 off clearance items depending on the season. I found a pair of lightwash destroyed ""erin "" skinny jeans for under 10 bucks in the clearance section way in the back. nScore! XS sell out really fast. nIf you're a size M or L, some good deals in the clearance section if you look",2
"Rubbish.waited 20 mins seating while no one offered anything. meanwhile sorted a restaurant close by with more personality. Waiter arrives after schmoozing for close to 30 mins At another table you don't have to work that hard for a tip , asking me what I wanted, lost my interest at this place already and I walked out",1
"I can't get enough of this Japanese fushion restaurant, Soho! Dishes here are fresh, delicious, it all comes with a nice clean presentation. We recently tried a few new dishes. If you're open minded try the following blue fin toro OMG fresh uni eat it without dipping it anything . In a nutshell, you must must come! ",2
"I'm a meh here too right now they've got a 3 course special starting at 9.99, so that was nice but the food was on the meh side. My lemon grilled chicken portion was huge a whole half smallish chicken , and the mashed potatoes are pure cream. Service was friendly but really slow. I'm not sure if I'd come back here if we were at Red Rock again.",1
SCRATCHES! I took my car to this carwash for the first time today and it scratched my car's driver side hood and the windshield frame. Plz see the pic I have uploaded. There are a lot more small scratches which I cannot capture with my phone's camera . YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! I'm so mad at myself for not believing other bad reviews and decided to give it a try. lesson learned.,1
"Rude service last time I was in to get flavor and coals ""what you want "" besides them having a poor selection of flavor they also had nothing but a junk selection of coals! Only stopped here because it's open late compared to most ""smoke shops "" on this side of town. If it's the day time, drive up the street in the walmart parking lot Mo's is much better!",1
"Horrible, sleezy and poorly run. The manager Fred Durst wannabe was a complete arrogant prick. So bad in fact that we had to leave. The staff is incompetent and even worse this place has an O.T.B section full of disgusting older men. worst idea to date. will never be back! Someone should call John Taffer this place needs it!",1
"This place is totally a trip, but so charming. Has anyone ever seen the movie 'Nothing But Trouble'? If so, this place was straight out of Valkenvania. Luckily, the ice cream was superb. I got the black cherry frozen yogurt and after one tongue swipe of my cone, I'd forgotten that I'd chosen frozen yogurt as opposed to ice cream. Can't wait to go back.even if it is totally freaky time warp.",2
"I came with an Asian tour bus group and they had more than enough seating for 30 plus of us. 12 for lunch buffet with very sparse selection. I didn't try the Mongolian stir fry. Food was mediocre and I think they only served different variations of california roll. Verdict I was mildly satisfied and didn't get a stomachache, so I guess that's a win.",1
"Went to The Chop Shop last night for ""Twin Forks "" and was very pleased. Parking was easy, staff were quick and very friendly, the acoustics were fantastic. Very cool place that is not pretentious in any way. All types are welcome, the musicians were very accessible and the staff were not rushing you out after the show. If you want to see a band at a cool, small, great place, The Chop Shop is it!",2
Small packed airport. I'm a bit shocked that an airport of this size try's to accommodate so many people. There are not enough seats. No place to plug in laptops or phones. Half of the travelers are sitting on the floor. Good luck trying to escape into a bar or restaurant. Too busy. Bags do come out quick upon arrival and it's only a few min from the airport to the strip.,1
"This is my favorite place to come to when I am home sick. I love their flautas they are the best. Anytime I miss El Paso, TX I just come here to bring back the memories. Another great quality about this place is their staff, I've been here numerous of times and they are always so nice and joyful, and never have an attitude. They make it feel the way it is back home.",2
"We went here for happy hour last night. The drinks were cheap 2 for a stein, and 3.50 for a strong Long Island , and because we got there right before the end of happy hour, they let us pre order our second round for later. The bar has a cool set up. I agree with other reviews the food is not good. Really unexceptional. I'd go here just for drinks.",1
"It was very over priced, burger was just alright, nothing amazing or spectacular. Went with friends who were also just as unsatisfied. One ordered the bleu cheese burger, asked for balsamic vinegar, which he never got. Made his burger suck even more. Fries were cold and not many on your plate. At least fill me up on some potatoes if your burger blows, YA FEEL ME?!",1
"The premium price is well worth it for their premium, authentic Japanese yakitori sashimi cuisine. In Nov 2011 they had a 45 all inclusive, no additional costs for taxes or tips AYCE Raku bufffet, unlimited sake sampling bottomless Asahi regular or Asahi Dark beers plus free bottled water . It was an awesome deal I can't wait for the next similar event.",2
"I usually stay at a ""nice "" hotel for business once a year Hyatt, JW Marriott . I recently stayed at the Wingate for a personal vacation spring training and was pleasantly surprised. For half the price, this hotel had all of the amenities, plus an attentive and friendly staff. Super clean, great free hot breakfast set up, nice pool and Jacuzzi. A little hard to find, but well worth it!",2
"Just got home from a friend's bday party at Sidebar, and my ears are ringing and my throat hurts from having to shout in order to talk with my friends. The music was ridiculously loud. I would go back in the future if I knew I'd be able to hear my friends talk.but I probably won't got back. No beer on tap all bottles and the margarita was way too sweet sour. Bummer!",1
"easy to get to because it's a quick stop on the highway. it's a good, cheap meal on your way to Utah or elsewhere! The burgers are really awesome and so are the shakes! I used to go here to eat after high school to relax and it was always a fun spot to chill at. However, I do suggest that everyone pass on the cheese fries because they are just so so and they should use a different cheese!",2
"In all fairness I have not stayed in the hotel, so this review will be confined to the public areas. The casino is dark, cavernous and loud, making it seedier than the actual New York no easy task . All that being said, they still have the nerve to have high table limits. The steak house, however was good, as is Nine Fine Irishmen. All in all it is worth a look.",1
"Excellent meal and dining experience. Salsa and chips were great. Salsa fresh and not too spicy and the chips were also fresh. Had the chimi and a combo of appetizers for dinner. nachos, sopes and tostadas All was excellent! The flan for desert I brought home and it was just good a few hours later. Maybe better fresh. Will definitely be going back!",2
"There are two nice tennis courts. While other places get full quickly, the courts here are rarely filled. The bike trails and skate park draws in some teenagers, but it is hassle free and a good place to bring little ones. The amenities are few compared to bigger parks, but it is relaxing due to the lack of crowds.",2
We loved it! We had a reservation for 6 and they sat us immediately. The servers were fantastic and made excellent recommendations. The primata margarita is very good. My friend and I shared the pork tacos for two. It was good but I think the others loved their meals more based on their reactions. The guacamole was good and we liked how we could get different versions.hot was the best!,2
"Love these guys. Bought my Mac book here about a year ago, got a great price and a great product. I recommend all my friends and family here for all apple needs. Just went in today too needing a new power cord. The guy working tested it and gave me an honest answer about where to get a new one. Keep it up Orchard great customer service and product. Love supporting local business too!",2
"Horrible. Choose another airline please! 15 hour delays going to San Francisco to Las Vegas both ways! Every hour was a new excuse for the delay. Service was awful. Customers on airplane for an hour with little cool air serving themselves water since flight attendants sitting around. Unbelievable! They never could find pilots to fly the plane. Please, choose another airline.",1
"I loved this store. I came here every week growing up and when I came back to visit Arizona after a year or so, my heart was broken. I believe Gracie's is closed now and they're building condos in the area. EDIT Gracie's has moved to the plaza over right next door to Food City. The old location is being built into low income apartments with Gracie's future location on the first floor.",2
Have been to this place many times. Would visit it twice a week. Such a regular that the server already knew my order. Last time I was there I found a worm in my soup. All they did was offer an apology and that's it. Even though I did not even eat half of my food they still made me pay for it. It's unfortunate that the food is good but treatment to loyal customers is so bad.,1
"Love, love, LOVE Dutch bros best service an best coffee for sure. They are always super fast and so friendly. I don't live right near any locations so I literally drive by like 3 Starbucks just to get to Dutch bros.it's always worth it! Should definitely put one between the spot on Glendale and the location in Thunderbird.",2
The store itself is great. The Pharmacy on the other hand is terrible. They have the worst customer service. Don't try to call and ask a question. You'll be put on hold for a VERY long time. Sometimes they just pick the phone up and place it directly on hold without acknowledging you. I'm switching.,1
"Went here for the first time and got the Bobbie sandwich turkey, stuffing and cranberry . Thanksgiving in July! It was really good. The place is cute, clean and the staff really friendly. We've heard from friends that this place was really good, and were not disappointed. Will definitely come again and try more of the yummy sounding sandwiches.",2
Amazingly great food. Owner is super nice and friendly. Good prices and very clean inside and out. Taste flavor everything absolutely amazing. First time here found my new home for pizza definitely won't go anywhere else now. If your ever in Gilbert Arizona don't pass up this place without stopping in and grabbing something to eat. Thanks for the great food experience and service.,2
"Great food, but pretty pricey for what you get. The atmosphere is nice and casual. Went on a Monday afternoon and it was steady but not overly crowded. Their crab dip is excellent, and their crab cakes might be the best I've ever had. All meat, almost no filler. It well be a while before I return, but only because of the price. About 25 to 35 per person, plus appetizers.",2
"I think Elite Nails is wonderful. It is spotlessly clean and they will accomodate you for anything you want. nThey have awesome pedicures, the high end one is about an hour nand a half. They are fast, polite, and everyone speaks English. nIt is best to make an appointment because they can get pretty booked nup. nTry them, you will be happy you did.",2
Probably an ok place to grab a drink and watch some sports but wouldn't recommend you eat there. I ordered the chicken brie sandwich sounded lovely on the menu but it was boiled chicken so rubbery it was tough to cut through. My husband ordered the steak tacos. They were so greasy he couldn't pick them up. We both had bad stomach ache for hours after eating there.,1
Please don't stay here. We've paid 300.00 a night and thought this was great for the whole family to enjoy the water park. The water slide and lazy river is not working ! nThe room here is old and not worth the money. Our keys doesn't work when we checked in. Had to get a second set and still doesn't work. I hate this place. I wish I went to a real hotel and a real water park.,1
"Seems a litle overpriced for chicken, fresh or not. I think if you skip the value meals and just get singles pieces of chicken, it may be a little more worth it. This place doesn't hold a candle to Buffalo Wild Wings. BW3's has more sauces, more selection and better prices. I'd say hang on to your and go get a snickers bar.",1
"Golden coral with few more options. Heck golden coral food taste better! Prime rib is the only decent dish. 1 soup available, breads are hard, all deserts are factory made nothing seems to be really made from their kitchen, only 1 seafood serve fish swimming in butter No crab legs mussels clams etc. Rice dish sucks, even breakfast eggs has weird taste. Never coming back to this place.",1
"I had a really lovely lunch here today. My croque madame a ham and cheese sandwich with a fried egg on top, but it's really just so much more was delicious, and the salad on the side was much heftier than what you'd expect to get in a similar US establishment. And the staff is mostly bilingual, which was very helpful. I'm thinking I might go back for a breakfast crepe tomorrow.",2
The wife and I have been here four times so far every time we had attentive staff superlative service and everything is always been cooked perfectly appetizers always show up first and everything seems to work perfectly the flavored tea is always perfect the meat is perfectly cooked the only thing I would have to say is their chili is weak for a chili head it has a slight zing,2
I threw my boyfriends surprise 21st bday party here. Matt and everyone I worked with at Kickstand were absolutely phenomenal. They are the nicest people. They were so willing to go above and beyond to make sure everything went smoothly. And the food was delicious! It was the perfect place to celebrate his birthday. I can't think Kickstand enough.,2
"Want a room with scary stains and torn carpeting? Want a ""complimentary breakfast "" so gross you'll feel like a contestant on Fear Factor? Want the most incompetent front desk employees in the history of the world? If you answered ""yes "" to any of those questions, this is the place for you! nIf you answered ""no "", stay at the Madison Hostel. It's about 10x cheaper and about 1,000x better.",1
"This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. They serve ""bar food "", but there's a nice variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian food. My favorite items on the menu are the veggie dogs, pizza, and soft pretzels. You can't beat their beer selection. Make sure to visit the beer cave while you are there and their section of take out beer for an even larger selection.",2
"Yelp brunch action yesterday was a perfect hangover cure afternoon a weekend on the sauce. Eggs Bennedict with smoked salmon aka eggs royale for me was a very tasty lunch, there was a slight over flavouring of vinegar but I was a slid effort. Good coffee and a Bloody Mary made for a good brunch experience.",2
"I love this place, great food, especially the steak great service, a great cuban environment, every time I come here I feel like I'm in a little slice of Havana, and the music makes me want to dance, they have a full bar as well, I recommend this place to anyone that loves traditional Cuban style and flavor!",2
"All I have to say is STICKY BUNS! I went to the El Chorro Lodge for the first time last Sunday for brunch. Outstanding! Great service, beautiful location and tasty food. I will certainly be going there again for brunch. I would like to try El Chorro for drinks or dinner. It looks to be a very happening spot.",2
As everyone has said. DO NOT SIGN UP unless you wish to pay all sorts of hidden fees and unless you want to go through hell to get out. I honestly don't know how these guys are allowed to get away with this crap. Yelping is fine but what about someone stopping them from being criminals? Doesn't the BBB shut down criminal behavior?,1
"Oh my goodness! I couldn't even get in the door of this place as people were piled up in there so that already tells you the food is legit.yep, a serious line to get in the restaurant and another line for the buffet and it's all worth it.they serve many of the regular Indian favorites on the buffet plus mango pudding My new Indian crush.",2
"Yes! As good as it gets after you've spent your day out in the desert. I don't know if my feelings of this place were skewed but who cares! It was nice to ""come home "" to a really clean and nicely decorated best western. I definitely didn't see that coming! Also, the kitchen was clean and well stocked. Thank goodness for that!",2
This place is so slow. No one knows what there jobs are around here. I seen the same guy running around the place doing little stuff. He was checking my tires. Now he is sitting next to me watching the football game. I came for a oil change a car wash. Should take no longer than 45 minutes. I am hitting a hour and fifteen minutes and my car is still not done. I would not recommend this place.,1
"The staff here is always friendly. They're always on the ball with the drink refills. You'll get good food for inexpensive prices here. I've eaten here and ordered off of the lunch menu and dinner menu. I really haven't had a bad meal at Tao Garden. We've gone here a few times and had dinner for about 18 people and only spent 140, including tip. You can't beat that.",2
"I've been here for breakfast brunch. Being from French Canada, the whole concept of Grits is new to me. I'm not sure i'm all about it. I had the egg tostadas and tasted the egg enchiladas. Everything was just alright. Maybe I'm just not into the taste of smokey chipotle for breakfast My favorite part of the brunch there is the variety of breads in the bread basket.",1
"This place is amazing! Fantastic bagels,crusty ,with the right amount of chewiness as well as texture and flavor.Delicious cream cheese ,hot breakfast sandwiches as well as deli.Just talked to a New Yorker friend of mine and she called it ""the only place besides New York that can serve a great bagel ""!",2
"Stopped by here on my way to Lake Mead. nThe men's T Shirt selection is not as huge as it is at Las Vegas Harley Davidson, but I found what I was looking for. nMore T Shirts More Stars! And the lady who helped me was very nice and friendly, which is the most important, because I can be sometimes a bit of an annoying customer, LOL",2
"Saddle Rack meets Las Vegas. If you like skanky crowd middle age ladies who don't act their age, old creepy guys and don't mind paying the Vegas price for the drinks whilst mingling with them, then Coyote Ugly is right down your alley. Otherwise, go someplace else. I'm surprised this place is still around after all this time. Is it the free shot?",1
"Great place. You gotta see the exhibit on 20th century art. Post Mao paintings are eye opener. Don't miss the video on the couple who collected them. It explains a lot. The exhibit on artists who were influenced by major modern artists like Picasso, Rivera, Kahlo another don't. The regular modern art exhibit is also a great collection",2
"I'll never visit a Ruth's Chris again! Went here for a boyf bday then Morton's for the bro's bday, no no don't be silly not all in one night! Everything about Morton's was better, the food, the service, the atmosphere, ESPECIALLY the atmosphere! And, the price tag at Ruth's Chris, so not worth it! Buy yourself some organic grass fed beef and grill it yourself, I'm telling you, totally way better!",1
"If I give a start it is just for the friendly staff working there. The food quality is pretty poor! The worst tasteless Poutine! I ever tried in Montreal! The thing they offer as a Pizza is called ""Flammekueches "" in other places and is much cheaper! The place itself is cool, but you pay too much for the food they offer!",1
"Boring, boring, boring. Compared to the other bars we went to, this was drab with a small crowd. They probably have their regulars but I wouldn't be one of them. The bathroom was very cramped and smelled awful. We had one drink before leaving, they were poorly made and didn't taste at all like they were supposed to. We left after 20 minutes.",1
"Standard Mongolian grill style restaurant. Ingredients are replenished quickly. Food is grilled even quicker. Seafood ingredients include shrimp, calamari, squid, shark meat and prawns. Regardless of the input combination of ingredients most dishes come out with the same taste with varying levels of spice, bitterness and salt. To get your money's worth bring a healthy appetite.",1
"Enjoyed a late lunch here a few weeks back I would DEFINITELY return, I loved the relaxed and unpretentious atmosphere of the place and the staff were extremely friendly and polite. Food portions are admittedly on the small size from what we saw, but that would be the only complaint for this place, and it wouldn't stop me from coming back or recommending it to others.",2
"If I can say anything positive about this place, it has a great location and the employees are nice. And they have a great little outdoor patio to eat in. But.this place is nowhere near as delicious as Chipotle. And they are so slow, even when its not a peak meal time. The Qdoba on Central is better. This location is still pretty new, so maybe they are still working out some of the kinks.",1
"We have been here twice and both times the food and service were outstanding. Jessica and Jo were friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. These qualities in wait staff are a credit to great management. We have tried BBQ from one side of the country to the other. This has been some of the best beef brisket. It was so tender and juicy. If you want a variety, the whole hog is the way to go.",2
You have to try this buffet to see what is the worst buffet in the world! Food are cold and plain uff0cthe noodle and fried rice are cold and so hard! The soup is also cold and super plain uff0cI would rather drink water. The vege is cold and super bitter uff0cI guess the chef forgot to put salt. In a word uff0cit is the worst reatuarant in the world!,1
I trusted my fellow Yelpers and stopped here for lunch as I traveled North. I had a great brisket sandwich. They told me that the meat was put in the smoker at 9 pm the prior night and it indeed was slow roasted perfection over a wood fire. They have a great BBQ sauce that complimented the meat. They know their BBQ here!,2
"Grease galore! This place is a fantastic stop for a snack. They've got several locations, and it's easy to miss if you don't realize you're looking for a small, free standing restaurant on the west side of Arizona Avenue in Chandler. I had the crab sticks imitation crab covered in batter and fried and fish. It was less greasy than Long John Silver's, and the price was about the same.",1
"Amazing acrobatics, cute story line, hilarious sexual jokes. Think Cirque du Soleil laugh factory in old world burlesque . My girlfriends and I, all nine of us, laughed so hard, from the beginning to the end. We were very pleased with the setting, the ambience, and the performance, and would love to come back for another laugh.again.and again.",2
I'll never go here again. I order the vegetarian sandwich to be delivered. The delivery guy shows up with no change which means I either have to turn away the food of pay 10 for the stupid thing. Then it was missing avocado. I called to complain and they told me to search for the avocado between the cheese. 10 for a sandwich I need a magnifying glass to see what's on it. F that!,1
"I did not stay here, but I ended up playing Blackjack in the Monte Carlo casino 2 nights in a row and had an awesome time! Monte Carlo has the best dealers. They are very personable and entertaining! We ended up playing here for hours. I am hoping to come back to Vegas soon. Monte Carlo is at the top of my list for places to stay!",2
Another bakery that started off with great good and now going down hill. The breakfast Farmer scramble and salad Spinach just not what is used to be. The employees are rude and the management could care less. The server delivered the wrong type of bread with my salad and reached over me to remove it to take it to another customer.,1
very expensive. The menu we were given only had prices for glasses of wine and didnt even mention that you could buy a bottle if you wanted too. The menu is basically a tapas menu and wasnt very good. it is an intimate cozy place but way too small for my tatse. I think it might do better with a live jazz band but i dont know wher they put it.,1
I didn't know it was possible to be in heaven at an airport. Especially considering the freezing rain and snow is delaying everything. The chicken is delicious. The biscuits are delicious. Nothing else to really day because that's all you need. Lifted my spirits and filled me up. I'm actually sad my flight is boarding because I couldn't finish it all.,2
The happy hour has a great menu at a fair price. The service was great as well. The only thing that I was a bit disappointed in was that the happy hour is only in the bar area and the bar is very small with a few 4 seat high tables and two community tables. I have never really been a fan of the community tables. But overall the experience was great and the food was yummy.,2
"The food was delicious, the service was perfect, the restaurant is super cool. I had the Deconstructed Grilled Veggie Pita the husband had the Monte Cristo. Both were absolutely delicious. The portions are spot on as well. Mine was just enough, while the husband ended up eating only half it's a big sandwich . Started with the Mozzarella zucchini sticks. Very good!",2
"Very slow and inefficient cashier. Once you get a table, all staff are friendly and accommodating. Food is below average, except champagne. I didn't expect good sushi at a buffet, but it was even worse. The salmon they serve is smoked. I would have liked it with cream cheese and crackers, but not with sushi rice. Champagne and steamed crab legs were my meal. I would not go back.",1
"Always a line to get in, but what do you expect for a good place? Been coming here for years. Portions are extremely generous. Hell, I could get away w ordering one entree if I took a date here. My go to's are the chicke waffle tower and any of the Benedict's. Always flavorful. Go here! Trust the fat kid",2
"Let's see.Coach.Dolce Gabana.Kenneth Cole.True Religion.Armani.Dooney Burke.Donna Karen.Nike.Burberry.Guess.Nautica.Ralph Polo Lauren.Movado.i think you get my point. Enough said really just get here if you got some real cash to spend and you won't be disappointed. Eat, Drink.and Be Merry my Friends!",2
"I moved all the way up to 2 stars because of the outside patio, and in the desert, that's a necessity. The food is good for a chain. The margaritas are good, and cheap. Service is alright, but why do they have to be so stingy on the chips? Is it so expensive to have more than one bowl of chips? Fail.",1
"I wasn't that impressed with this restaurant when we are there a month ago, food was mediocre and tables were dirty. I just read that they were featured in Dirty Dining this week for for 38 demerits. nhttp www.jrn.com ktnv news dirty dining Dirty Dining Asian Buffet and Ra Sushi 269299381.html?lc Smart",1
At first I was skeptical about the price but it was all worth it. My black mercedes looked brand new. The team did an awesome job beyond my expectations. Rich provided expert advice before and after it was completed. Protect your investment and purchase their easy to use products. Definetly would highly recommend this place.,2
"The management here is so bad I've talk to the managers several times that there's never no carts to use their all in the parking lot, shopping carts are everywhere but where they need to be you can't find a good parking spot because their shopping carts in the way the magic just don't give a crap so I don't know why you'd want to do them a favor because this Walmart won't do you a favor.",1
"What can you say about Panda Express Fast Food? It's fast and that's it. Nothing to get your palate all excited about or go out of your way for.It is just plain ol' sustenance at a glance. Put your money down and they stuff you. Now move it! Pros about this franchise It's fast! nCons about this franchise It's fast! As they would say in older Taco Belch commercials ""Want Some? """,1
HATE One of my shirts had a stain when I got it back that was NOT there when I dropped it off. Inattentive employees I literally rang the bell 10 times with no response after waiting for a clerk for 15 minutes . DISLIKE They laundered my shirts after I told them I wanted them dry cleaned partially my fault cause I didn't make sure the ESL clerk understood me . LIKE Open late. LOVE Nothing.,1
"Your best bet here is to get a skillet and upgrade the basic pancakes to the red velvet pancakes. I typically order the ranchero skillet, and share the cookie batter French toast with my wife. Let me tell you, you MUST order the cookie batter French toast. It is awesome, and don't let the ""cookie batter "" in the name deter you. Just get it!",2
"Food was a super greasy. The employees were super rude. Never going back there. Dead flies on the ground. There's a dollar charge when you pay with your card. Then the employee gives you attitude when you say ""I'll pay in cash. "" So if you enjoy greasy food with rude employee and like to see dead flies on the ground this is your place!",1
The food can be ok. So can the service. If you come by boat or bike make sure you are fully clothed. They may look at you like you are nuts if you show up in a bathing suit. For every 2 good waitresses there is 1 good. I like the beer battered chicken sandwich. The shrimp quesadilla had weird textured shrimp. The peel and eat shrimp are pretty good.,1
Would give it a zero if I could. No prices listed. This is a scam! They bait you in and then charge you like crazy! I was told that I get 2 lobster tails and then I get 1 tail split in half! REALLY!?!?!?!?!? Just tell me it's 1 tail! LIARS! This place is a bunch of bullshit and liars! Skip this place and move on!,1
"weak selection and lackluster in taste on most ""hot entree "" items and they didn't serve them hot desserts mediocre at best and selection was . ""yawn "" service was ""ok "" however after drink refills nobody was bussing plates or table touching, ask for a manger and was told there unavailable at this time. floored ",1
"SO delicious, I need to write a review on another location. This one has the benefit of 1 being really close to CMU campus and 2 being right under the labs I spend all my time now. Favorites honeydew, mango, green tea. nRunner ups original, taro, most ""tart "" flavors . The only thing to beware of is the gaping hole in your wallet after you've punched out an entire card in 2 short weeks.",2
"For being a chain restaurant, I really do love this place. It's always consistent and taste delicious every time. Some of our favorites are the Alfredo of the Dark pasta with chicken, the Big Rig with Sausage, the BBQ chicken pizza is outstanding. And to top it off a pizza cookie for dessert. What more can I say. Great food, great prices, great service.",2
"Went on a Thursday night where there was a 35 minute wait. Friends asked that we meet them there. Service, as usual, was terribly slow 15 minutes to get our water and then another 10 minutes to get our drinks. The food took forever to arrive, but was pretty tasty. It was an over 2 hour generally poor experience. I think I've finally learned my lesson and will never return.",1
"The three different nines are fun to play, but don't confuse this with a country club. No real range to warm at and even the foam ball play area and putting green aren't in operation. Oh and BTW your tee time has been pushed back because the Men's Club had trouble teeing it up earlier. Too many other options in the Valley to play. Why come here? Doubtful I will again.",1
"1 Word. Yucky. I guess I have ""high standards "" being from New York, but between the pizza and the grossly overpriced, watery sauced, rubbery ""Chicken Parmigiana "", I don't think I'll be making a return visit to this place. Mediocre service. I've had much better, and in a climate with such fierce competition for the consumer's dollar I think they should try harder.",1
I did happy hour here last night and it was not bad. We got the calamari which was very difrent. It had a spicy sauce on it that was pretty good. We also got the lettuce cups which I normally love but did not like this one. And I got a small chicken and rice soup which was good but not Hot. Service was excellent though. Would like to go back and try other items.,2
"The service here on 5 25 14 was bad. The guy seemed to only focus on me another guy and not my fiance. Instead of asking if we wanted more to drink he'd just come and grab our cups. The chips and salsa, in my opinion, are terrible. The beans are ok. We didn't like the food at all. Will not be coming back.",1
"I've been here twice but took a break from reviews since I wasn't getting paid for them. The food is overall good. Desserts fantastic don't like the price of a shake, but the frozen hot chocolate is good. I'm not a big onion ring eater but they are bomb. Portions are big so the price balances out. It's hard to go wrong here and service is swell.",2
"The food here used to be outstanding, not today.we both ordered the tonto burger 13.50 ea. I don't know where they are getting there beef from these days but it was horrible and the fries soggy!Our waitress Cara did not "" cara "" a bit about service, had to wait at least 15 minutes for our bill! We would always bring out of town guests here for the food and views.won't be doing that anytime soon!",1
called ahead and took our dogs here. they set up the outside patio for us along with many water bowls for all the pooches. All I ate was their desert pizza cookie which was just ok. the bread they bring out as a complimentary snack was yummy though so I'm excited to try their actual food next time I go. Nice place and friendly service.,2
Horrible nI took a piece of glass there simple size nAnd I had to go back 3 times because they could not get the size right. nThe first time the guy wrote it down wrong. The second time the so called professional measured it wrong even though I told them to make sure to compensate for the the frame and channel. Not acceptable,1
"This place always has very long lines, even at the self checkout stations. On top of that several of the checkout stations are always closed. I can understand being too cheap to keep the checkout lines adequately staffed, but closing self checkout lines while customers are spending several minutes in line just seems malicious.",1
"Just another run in with Big Pharma! These medical companies treat patients like s. It's ridiculous. It's all about the money. ""Where's your insurance card "" ""we can't treat without card "" Yada Yada Yada! You'd think they'd care about the patient. Why can't they see you first and worry about insurance later? It ain't like I'm not insured. It's just ridiculous!",1
"All your asian food needs in Vegas. In Chinatown 1 mile from the strip off Spring Mountain, you can find every asian seafood, cookie, veggie, and delicacy here. We were lucky to come on a day where they had ice cream samples too. Check out the specials for great discounts. Just don't get the American goods as they are marked up for import.",2
"I ordered one of the sushi boats, and the sushi tasted like supermarket sushi. The boat itself was 26. They were probably one of the worst tasting sushi I've had in my entire life. Fish was far from fresh, and the rice was definitely not sushi rice. My boyfriend liked their ribeye steak though so that was fine. Service was great. Just avoid their sushi at all cost.",1
"My wife and I have been there twice and have never gotten to taste the food. After standing in a line that never moved we left after ten minutes both times. Other customers who had been waiting left also. It seemed that the employees almost didn't know or care that we were waiting. Strange way to service their customers. Also, no anchovie pizza offered?",1
I had Chicken and Ribs with beans and mac cheese and it was finger licken good. If you like saucey BBQ this place is pretty good. Both the Rib and Chicken were falling off the bone and the beans were really good. I'm not usually in to the BBQ that is saucey I found myself stuffing my face. By the way. the serving size was huge.,2
"Bought our home in Anthem a year ago knowing that it had several problems and that we wanted to make some changes. We have had them out several times. They were on time, listened to what we wanted, gave us great suggestions and completed extensive gas and water upgrades fast, efficient and clean. We really liked both the guys and the company. They have our highest recommendation.",2
"Great place, fresh food, lots of choices . indoor outdoor seating. Great food. First time here had a great meal and the service is good . The place does get a bit crowded, but is well worth it. My wife had the portabella mushroom sandwich which was fantastic I had Sonoran dogs and really enjoyed them the fries were great too. Definitely coming back",2
"Favortie dive bar in Tempe. Awesome jukebox but the atmosphere can be hit or miss really only a miss when people are watching T.V. and I cant play the jukebox . Cash only but there is an ATM onsite. 3 pool tables, a dart board, pinball machine and Galaga fill this moderate space. No lock on the men's door so dont sit near it unless you want a little peek ",2
"Food was good experience not so good. Was told an hour wait, waited an hour an forty five minutes after complaining. Went to the bathroom and noticed six open tables. Waiter forgot our orders and never filled our drinks, and took forever to box up our leftovers. For a 110 dollar tab for two. Not my top choice.",1
"Our family has come here for the last 15 years. We came on Christmas for dinner. Didn't get in until 8 pm. No food until 10pm some items sold out. Fine. Grandma wanted to come for her birthday so we gave them another chance. Her potato was ROTTEN. One side forgotten, one meal undercooked, etc. Place has gone down hill. Never going back.",1
"Good service, good atmosphere, average 12 per entree. nHaving returned from a 3wk trip iorthern India about a month ago, I was disappointed with the food. n Mattar Paneer was alright the peas seemed to be the frozen kind, very sweet. n Chicken curry was too salty n Goat Rogan Josh was good n Rice and Garlic Naan were good. My Indian coworker recommended Mint I guess I'll try that one next.",1
I am in search of a taco that is at least edible. I ordered 2 tacos and tossed 1.5 tacos. Not even close to a street taco in So Cal or Mexico. And they were more than 2.50 each. Highway robbery for a terrible taco. People here were really friendly though. Only reason they got a 2 and not a 1 was the people in the building.,1
"The 4 stars goes to the service rep Bri. She was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful despite how busy she was, and did not have the condescending attitude a lot of technical reps have. The store itself could use some more benches to sit on, and they need to turn down the music! Repetitive house dance music blows!",2
"Where's the hot and ready? Every time I've been here I've had to wait at least 20 minutes! They'll have ten people standing in there and you'll see their employees walking around having conversations with their co workers. Like really? In addition, their overall customer service is horrible. They get 1 star for good pizza and crazy bread.",1
"Banfield is way overpriced and after finding a much better vet honest, more knowledgeable, not focused on money I realized how crappy this place really is. Would NOT recommend. I have yet to know someone that has had a positive experience with any Banfield, but this is the location I have personally used.",1
"Terrible service from all of the bartenders. One mocked the great Nieve M. singer and got up onstage to sing a version of ""f you "" a good performance but continued to talk badly of the own performer she hired. Expensive brews for being imported and domestic. Humidor has good selections not not variety.",1
"Just was walking by when looking for dinner and this restaurant had an appealing setting. The waitstaff was ok, nothing special. Best part of the whole meal was the complimentary bread basket. The penne a la vodka lacked taste and the margarita pizza was nothing special. Definitely overpriced for the quality of the food. Disappointed overall, much better options on the strip.",1
"Worst buffet I've been to on the strip. Their desserts are delicious. They have cotton candy and chocolate covered strawberries. The food, however, is bland and boring. The selection is poor. Definitely not worth time and money. Go somewhere else! I would suggest walking over to Paris and eat at theirs.",1
"Use to love this place however my most recent experiences here will keep me until some major changes happen. Services sucks, food quality has declined, and bartenders take advantage of people they think are drunk which I've seen happen to other people, and most recently to myself . With the amount of competition in the area, this bar is not worth the time.",1
"I love the Book Rack! I recently moved to Charlotte and was on the hunt for a good used book store. They have a great selection which includes an entire bookcase of my personal favorite genre, Southern Fiction. I like that you can sell books and get some extra change to purchase other books. I could spend hours on hours in here!",2
Where do I began. Ordered pasta Alfredo with extra chickeever got the extra chicken wtf. Worse off my dinner was served cold. I ordered pasta not revenge. Very heavy on the garlic. Not vampire friendly. The biggest steak they have is 8oz. 4 or 5 of those my fill you up. It's not really a family restaurant. Just a glorified sports hang out. Less sports hotter food would be great.,1
Don't try to use your Jamba Juice gift card here machines card readers worn out or never cleaned.cashier said n she could not manually type in the card number or she could be fired. Really? Definitely disappointed that I could not use my Birthday gift! At least I got a Starbucks gift card took my business across the parking lot.8 20 13 5 40 PM,1
"fast friendly, english speaking. food ordered was food delivered to the table. free refills. what you demand at a fast food place. average service. just make it fresh get it right! they did good nthe carne asada was very good. tender spiced just right. everything was hot fresh. could've used a little more cilantro onions but they are 2 bite tacos. excellent value for the ",2
"Biked to Rivertowne with a friend for a beer and some appetizers. It was a nice day and the Buccos were playing. Overall the service was average, but the pub pretzels were great fyi, they are fried . We also had the fried zucchini which were good. Good atmosphere, decent food, check it out when you can.",2
"3 star without Boba. Boba boosts them up to 4 star. Pho lacks meat and you will stay hungry unless you get some extra meat in there. Kinda sparse with the herbs and the spices. Not the best Pho I've had, but hey, they do well. Service is. meh. They aren't really service oriented. Take your order and don't bother you style.",2
I grew up in a household where every Friday night was pizza night. I still crave a good slice or 3 on Fridays. Portofino's has great hand tossed thin crust pizza. They use a tomato sauce that is light and has a great flavor. I usually do carry out and appreciate that there is a separate counter and cash register for this. Portofino's is a solid choice in our Friday night pizza lineup.,2
I wasn't really Into thai food until I came here. Now I love it! Every time I have gone in I've tried something different and so far there is nothing I haven't liked. The staff is always super nice and helpful with the menu. They also give you the decision to make your meal as spicy or as mild as you'd like.,2
Good place for a drink as the views are nice and there is always something going at the hotel. I thought the food was a little subpar for the price. I like that they make the guacamole right in front of you. The entire place is wide open so it can get pretty noisy we did not mind Definitely enough space for children.,1
"I'm not sure where the good reviews are coming from?! The buffet was priced at 6.99, which is a great price, and included mango lassi and chai, but the quality of food was poor. Every curry gravy was thick with corn flour, so much so we could not focus on the flavors. The decor is not much better from the days of the Taj. The gentleman who waited on us was friendly.",1
"The Flat Top recently made a change where you cannot put veggies, noodles, sauces, etc. in your own bowl for them to cook. Within the last month, they put up plexiglass, and you tell someone standing behind the plexiglass which vegetables you want and they do it for you. That's half the fun filling your own bowl! Boo! Likely won't return any time soon.",1
This place used to be my fav Japanese food restaurant in Vegas . My most recent visit was not as expected. Service was great as usual but the sushi rice was intolerably hard. Sushi fans will understand the importance of good sushi rice. I am not upset. I am disappointed. I wonder if this restaurant is on the decline. Please note though Yelpers. Perhaps it's just an off day.,1
Disappointed.i will say we don't usually go to buffets. We got free buffet pass with our stay at the Wynn. So we went for lunch. There always seems to be a wait so you figure it must be good. We waited about 15 20 minutes. The service was good. Drinks refilled and plates cleared. The food or price is the problem. For what they charge the quality of food is not there.,1
"2 TVs in 3 weeks. The first one lasted 2 days, the second one two weeks. The first time I walked in the guy was nice and friendly. When I exchanged the first TV he had a bad attitude. What a waste of money. I guess you get what you pay for. Apparently no refunds only exchanges. So now I'm stuck hauling TVs back and forth every month. Awful experience",1
"We've been to mastro's 20 times at least and we went last week and everything tasted flat. It is usually great and the service was great as usual, but the salad, steak and sides were just off. They were just purchased by landry's and seems like every place they buy goes down hill. I would try Jean Georges if you want a good steak at city center.",1
"Happy hour in the bar is a steal if you can fade the crowds. The prices on the dinner menu are ridiculous when you consider they are a locals place. You can't charge as much or more than every top steakhouse in town and claim you ""love your locals ""! Plus with the bar being jam packed and that noise overflowing into the restaurant, who wants to have a 400 meal in that noise?",1
I absolutely love this Port of Subs! The food is amazing and always FRESH! nI have met and ordered from the owner Michael who is a always very pleasant and cares about his customers. I highly recommend eating here because of the service with a smile and the place is always super clean! I would give the place 6 stars if I could!,2
"We got the summer roll. It was great, fresh, and tasty. The sauce was a little too peanutty for me, but, it was still good. We also got the pho. Now, my favorite is Vietnam Grill on South Blvd. But, this is close to home, and their pho was very tasty. The broth flavorful, the noodles perfect, veggies fresh and crisp. Can't wait to try some of their other dishes!",2
I used to like this place because the way they cook their food is amazingly good until the portion got really smaller. Used to be one order of fried rice is good for 3 people now one order is only for one person that's how bad the portion is. I ordered red curry and chicken pad Thai same thing the portion is really small.,1
"Considering the options in the food court at the palms, this is most likely your best bet.unless, of course, you're hammered and you want mcdonalds or pizza or gasp panda express. They make everything as you order it, so you're not gona get some nasty limp salad thats been sitting there for three hours.",2
Place is awful. I was excited to go here because its world known.what a letdown. We went to see Deadmau5 recently and the sound system was horrible. The inside room had two speakers BLOWN. BLOWN SPEAKERS IN A CLUB OF THIS MAGNITUDE and price ? The outside area wasn't dialed in either. So far Drai's and Marquee are my Vegas go to's.,1
"It's a Miracle this place is still in business, the customer service is HORIBLE! I'm not even sure how they pass health codes, the guy making the pizza was also doing the register and handling money going back and making pizza without gloves or washing hands!?!? Between that and the little gang banger making the bread making smart ass comments, I strongly advise nobody to eat here!",1
"The buffet is gross and not worth the money. We went here to enjoy a night of Bingo with some friends to celebrate a birthday. We decided it would be easier to eat at the buffet beforehand. Unfortunately, it was a huge mistake. The only thing that tasted good was the salad. Everything else was borderline inedible. Won't be eating here when we come back to the casino.",1
"King's is a great experience. The food is fresh, well prepared, comes in a good portion size, and is served by attentive staff. I even enjoy the decor of the restaurant it fits the bill quite well. I'm not saying it's the best fish house ever, but considering the somewhat reasonable prices, it's a safe bet.",2
"So I normally go to the one in Tempe and decided to go to this one. I see a lot of comparisons between the two so I wanted to see the difference. And quite frankly, I'm not sure what they are talking about. Both of them seemed to have generally the same stuff. Good clean store, but as the Tempe location is closer, I will continue to go to that store instead.",2
"Cold tortillas, awful service from the owner she actually rolled her eyes at us when my friend asked that our tortillas be served warm because it was cold the previous time she was there , and the food really wasn't all that great. We're never going back. There are far better spots in the South Side and in Pittsburgh in general.",1
the food is not too bad. i went there for lunch and all i wanted to do was try some of thier mojitos. but since i was going back to work it was not a real option. but i would defintaly like to go back for some dirnks and try some of thier food. everythign on thier menu was different. i really liked the menu and the things that i tried from the people i was dining with were pretty good.,2
"Amazing, amazing mall for shopping. Nuts, I tell you. For so many reasons, 117F will keep a girl either in the pool or under AC. Full price for purchases would have been in excess of 800. Our damage 157! Caught a Tommy Bahamas fashion show.shopped around the Apple store, looking at the new Pro Retina Display. The sheer of stores here. Being at the Encore helps much right across the street!",2
"Truly one of the more beautiful areas of Phoenix. Gorgeous homes and tree lined streets, this casual stroll around the Biltmore makes you feel like you are somewhere outside of Phoenix. Always a great bike ride or walk to Hava Java thru the Loop. P.S. watch for errant golf balls. There are some bad golfers out on that course.",2
I am thankful for this place. The only thing if someone like me wants to eat here every day it would be nice to have a daily special. A new exiting menu every year or even 6 months would be nice too. I would like to eat here every day but after couple days I get tired of the same and I just go somewhere else.,2
The way French brunch should be. The way all brunch should be. New Yorkers think they know brunch. I thought I did too. Then there was this. This is a game changer. Like brunch itself is a game changer. You need more game. Eggs Benedict. Fresh OJ. Beautiful people. This place should be a song. Who has Pharrell's number? More stuff.,2
The Dim Sum was below average. I was with my THAI wife and son. It was really strange the staff wanted to touch my son during the entire meal. I ask one female server not to touch my son 17 month old. She continued to hang around our table wierd. The people sitting next to us thought it was crazy. We will not be going back.,1
"DELISH! Reasonably priced, make sure to wear comfy clothes you will need to pull your sleeves up and wash your cloths right after , spicier than average so you may want to order a spice lower than usual on your first try , service was ehh but they were SUPER busy, parking sucks, bathrooms are eh. But what can I say, it definitely hits the spot when you are looking for a crawfish joint.",2
"Woo what a surprise! This place was awesome. Our waiter was a little goofy, but it was nice to have someone who didn't mind acting like himself. The food was delicious! I had the Blackened Hamburger, which was the perfect level of spiciness! The drinks were fantastic as well. Loved the atmosphere, will definitely be back!",2
"If you like dark crowded hallways that play music way too loud, than this is the place for you. This place is way too small for the amount of people they let in and there is no dance area but plenty of music to dance to. During the day it's not to bad but avoid when there is line out front because it will be way too crowded and impossible to get a drink.",1

And it's hard to ignore the premium prices for not so premium pizzas. 2.5 stars",1
I went to eat breakfast here this morning and I have to tell you that WOW it was a great place to eat breakfast! I will be eating here at least once a week! The waitress was polite and the food was great and reasonable! Had the Eggs Benedict and I will make sure to treat myself every Friday! Thank you for a great experience!,2
"I'm being nice with my rating. Really. I gave it the extra star for their 12.99 dinner pricing. nBut oh sweet Jesus, the only thing they can boast about for their buffet is FRIED SHRIMP? Seriously? Well, whatever. The only people who eat their are the hicks who probably consider it food for the gods and who've saved up their entire lives to vacay at Circus Circus with their 30 bucks a night fees.",1
2 stars and that's only for the view. Maybe go here for a drink only to enjoy the view. The food was really not good and very overpriced . The bacon wrapped pear appetizer tasted old and freezer burned. The Chilean sea bass wasn't bad honestly The wine list leaves a lot to be desired. The service was very good I must say and again the view was great but won't be returning.,1
"Well it was my mom's birthday and I thought this would be a good place to eat at. First off, the waitress are rude. Typical bitchy filipinas. Second, their food is way too expensive for a poor quality. It was gross and tasteless. It was such a disappointment going there. I should have picked DT's instead.",1
"Just went there today. For all the complainers about the 16.95, today they are offering 10.00 off the monthly pass. So that's a great deal. I think for just to drive through for 10.00 a wash and vacuums that work better then any I have ever tried before isn't so bad a deal. I have purchased monthly passes before and had no problem canceling.",2
Just walked out of the Dunkin Donut totally disgusted. Female employee with long dirty blonde hair putting up fresh vanilla frosted donuts. Problem holding basket of donunts on hip and her hair is laid all over the donuts WTF. Totally nasty will never see me again. This parking lot is the closet I get this this store again.,1
CUSTOMERS BEWARE. THERE ARE THIEVES WORKING IN THIS STORE. I live out of state and gave my credit card number to the sales manager at this store location. His name is Robbie .After one week. I had over 2k dollars of fraud charged on my credit card at North Carolina Gas stations. This has been turned over for investigation.,1
"Good food and good people. Ordered pickup on they way between work and home without a menu. The owner walked me through the menu basically I asked if they had it and either they did or they would make it for me. Cannot complain about that. Food was good, not the best I ever had, but certainly better than most.",2
"Dennis gave us a very reasonable quote on cleaning up a huge job on a very neglected Bank owned 5 acre property. He and his team showed up clean, professional and prepared for that big job. They even did clean up work that was not included in the quote. Great job only this crew for any clean up large or small for us. nDiamond Team Realty ONE Group",2
"I know tea.I have been drinking tea for the last 45 years all over the world. I have tried 4 different teas here and they were way way below average with unpleasant after taste. You are better off with starbuck or coffee bean tea. Souvia Tea would be my last choice for ""good tea "". Very very disappointed. still searching for the ""best tea "".",1
"I used to have lunch here all the time, the food for lunch is Ok! It has a huge buffet with a wide variety of Chinese and Japanese food. The sushi is good, the hibachi chicken is decent and the Chinese food is generic. For 10.95 the variety is good for lunch however I would not recommend this place for dinner. It is very expensive and it has too much going on.",1
"Front door guy is a joke. Charging me 70 for entry that's not eveight club numbers . Prior to that he tells me ""you know it's a private party right!? "" If I didn't know that I wouldn't be In front of the line. He questions my envelope which had my money and I bet once he saw how thick it was singles he thought he could bump up the price when the front desk girl said it's really 20. What a joke.",1
"Owner manager Mike Monko does NOT know how to run a business. Mike and his employees did not know how to use his computer payment system. When getting refunded I was charged again and it was never straightened out at the store so I had to dispute the purchase with my bank and was refunded through my bank. DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY HERE, you may get double charged.",1
"Mediocre food that took well over 30 minutes to get. I wasn't the only one that night. Most people left pretty pissed. Maybe it was an off night, but I felt like I've had way better food from Chipotle and some chain restaurants for the same price and in a reasonable time frame. Skip this place and keep looking!",1
"What's to say! It's a grocery store with what ya need downtown. It's not hipster or shady.it's just a good, simple grocery store with a great mix of produce, organic and other baked goods. The prices are fair even though some things I know are cheaper elsewhere for many of us it means not having to drive so its all good.",2
"Ordered wings for delivery and asked for specifics of less dry. Wings came dry on the underneath. Called and asked for a new order and had to bring back the wings ourselves. Unapologetically the counter lady Beth told us that they dont toss their wings. ""Toss the wings, who does that "" said Beth. Do yourself a favor. Dont eat this place. And its dirty. Filthy kitchen.",1
"Ummm. if you're not open til 11 30am on a Sunday, then change the sign on your door which indicates you're open at 10 30! There were 7 in our group and 3 others waiting outside til finally a gal opened the door to inform us of their operating hours. We didn't wait an hour for them to open, opting instead for Ritter's.",1
"Really cool, foodie restaurant in scottsdale. All the food was fresh and original. The service was quick and pleasant, and definitely a place to consider to eat. It's not the cheapest restaurant but worth the price. This place definitely belongs in Scottsdale as is more upscale and you could sense it from the decor and service.",2
Big Dog Coffee is great little coffee shop near South Side Works in the South Side of Pittsburgh. The coffee is great and staff are friendly. Free Internet is available just ask for the login password. Note don't park on the lot to the side as this belongs to the private apartment building and you might get towed.,2
This place is pretty bad. I have never seen a restaurant with such great looking food on the menu deliver such lousy food. Service is not genuine. Burgers are greasy and disgusting along with the steaks. Avoid this place no wonder how good the 2 for 20 sounds. Used to be a fan of Chili's before. What happened?,1
24th floor with a partially obstructed view of the Bellagio fountains. NICE About everything else average at best. The price location combo is its saving grace. Anytime I spent at the hotel not sleeping I walked over to Paris. The check out line on Sunday was ridiculous it was for check ins too so I did express check out . . . sorry check in people.,1
"What I really liked the most? nThose cute old plates they leave in every table. Made me feel like grandma was around hehehe. Food was tasty and in good portions, just the salad that I had with my quiche was a bit dead. I wonder if it was 'cos they were busy for the AZ dine out week. If you are a young lady.this place has really good looking waiters! Enjoy!",2
If they aren't interested in serving you dinner in the bar because of lack of help? they just don't clear the tables in the bar area. We put our name back on the list for main dining room and told them why.THEN they hustled to clear it. Our waiter was overworked but he did a great job. Food was fine but I've had better there other times.,1
Superb beer selection. Music was really nice and at a good volume. Really a great place to hang out and have a drink. We missed aka were too tired to stay up past our bedtime a jazz jam session. Will have to grab a coffee and hang out next time because I miss me some good jazz. It's so hard to find in Phoenix!,2
"I had bought a early 90s 4runner on the cheap, knowing it needed some work. Among other things, it had one hell of an exhaust leak from the rusted out cat. Advance was able to weld in a replacement that fit my budget and did the work while I waited. They're my go to for all things exhaust related now.",2
"I think this place is comparable to Maggiano's for a fraction of the price, I think the baked Penne and it was wonderful, I will try something else next time but this place may become a regular stop once a week. The decor is very nice and such a bargin for the price the staff has been great both times one with my girfriend and the other we had a group of 6.",2
"I've never had a bad experience there. I love the Mexico City burrito their chorizo is fantastic. The service has been a bit slow at times when they are very busy, but even in those situations, the food comes out pretty quickly. The fresh guacamole is also FANTASTIC and made right at your table. Highly recommended.",2
"Had pizza, a salad and a garlic roll. The garlic roll was excellent. The pizza reminded me of being back in Long Island. Even met an Uncle of the Family from Islip Terrace What a treat! The food was great, the service was exceptional and of course I enjoyed the company because we talked about growing up in Long Island. Good food, I will go back there for my pizza cravings.",2
"See my tip.I think the main concern is the parking. Don't be! It's in the back, INTO the garage which is absolutely free and safe. HOMEMADE CREPES in EVERY order and keep in mind, it's NOT small. It's pretty big crepe, even when it's folded. Defy thumbs up! CUTE place to dine. I will return for breakfast one day SOON! .and the price? Really? Can you actually find a fault with this?",2
"The food was very fresh and pretty tasty. The restaurant is very clean and the service is prompt and courteous. I like that there is a Pho restaurant on this side of town and we don't have to drive to Chinatown to enjoy a decent meal. The prices are very reasonable which gives you the opportunity to enjoy more items from the menu. This will now my ""go to "" Pho restaurant.",2
"We ran into this truck at the Foodie Fest over the weekend. We tried the vegan sausage with peppers, onions and mustard. It was just as expected, nothing fancy but we're greatful that they recognize that not everyone eats meat. I did really enjoy the bread. It was fresh, soft and the perfect size for the fillings.",2
Can't give this place any stars. The people that gave this place any stars have probably never been to a nice stip club. This place was dirty! Downstairs felt like a third world country brothel and upstairs was just way too much going on. Tons of strippers on the floor which wouldn't be bad if this joint strived for quality and not quantity.,1
I don't get it. it is a fast food joint. The burgers are okay and the staff is great! But how do they turn real potatoes into those weird things they call French fries? They are okay as long as they are hot but let them cool down and they get this strange texture. It isn't terrible and the price is right but it wouldn't be my first choice. They do hire and or train exceptional staff.,1
"If we weren't staying at the Flamingo, I don't think we would have gone to this place. Nothing good, nothing bad, but the chain could have been plopped into Minneapolis or South Dakota. Typical Mexican chain and everything had that corporate taste. I suppose most go for the showboating by the bartenders, but there just was not anything memorable about my meal.",1
"Nice location right on the Bellagio fountains. If it's nice out its worth the wait for a balcony table. Prices are moderate, considering its in the Bellagio. We had the chicken margarita sandwich with sweet potato fries, the chicken was a tad dry and the fries just ok. We also had a Tuscan flat bread that was good and had plenty of toppings. For the view alone this place is worth checking out.",2
"This shop is so close to my home so I thought I would give this place a try. I will not return. I went today and when I sat down for a manicure, I noticed the floor was filthy and the one technician working there did not even use a clean towel. I was the only person in the shop. I do not know how they stay in business. Will be looking for another nail shop to try.",1
holds some of my fondest memories of my college years.the grad school years when i had a car to get to this place. i could never order anything other than the reuben and beer. it was so good i couldn't try anything else. oh how i miss the 1990s and this place because it doesn't seem like anything has changed here and that is a GREAT thing .,2
"Not sure, how this place received any good reviews. The service was bad, as well as, the food. It took a while to be seated, even though there were plenty of empty tables. I ordered the BBQ pork and Duck, the meat smelled really rancid. I was so disgusted. I informed the waiter that the food was bad, he didn't offer a refund, just the bill to pay. Beware of this place.",1
"This place is the best breakfast house in Phoenix! The New Mexico green chile is what lured me in and the atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing food keeps us coming back! The decor in this place is so warm and inviting. You've got to try this place! I'm sure when you do, you'll keep coming back just like we do! nGo get you some OBH!",2
"BE AWARE! This location has the most unprofessional, inappropriate and inconsiderate sales associates I have ever dealt with. nThey were not accommodating, knowledgeable or have a clue on how to treat customers with integrity and respect. By the way, during this entire experience, there was no one else in the store.",1
"I was hopeful for a good pho shop near my house, this one is not it. Soup in general is not very flavorful, kinda seems like they are skimping on ingredients. The meat in my soup didn't help the flavor any and also seemed like it was not the best quality. The topper is price, too high for what you're getting. I will try again in a few weeks and hope they work the kinks out.",1
I absolutely adore this place! The lakefront makes you forget you're in the desert. Sitting on the deck with your friends as the sun goes down with the lake in the background PICTURE PERFECT. The food and drinks are always good and reasonably priced. Staff is always so friendly. All of which makes me come back for more time and time again.,2
What can I say. Great pie for the price. Love the thin crust pizza reminds me of pizza you get in Italy with the nice burns on the corners. Add the garlic and butter to the dough. You add the toppings you want. Fresh toppings. Always full of flavor. If you want a great personalized pizza this place is the spot. Try the iced teas too.,2
I LOVE THIS BAR! It's better than the Cosmo Chandlier Bar. Less people and better service. I was with a group of 10 people and decided to check this bar out. We had a great cocktail waitress for a short time. The seating were very comfortable. We got there at 1am and stayed till closing. The drinks were great and lots of laughter. I highly recommend this bar to anyone.,2
"No matter what time of day, this is the place for filling, hot and delicious Mexican food. There's just something a little better about this particular establisment. Perhaps it's because they remember us when we visit or the food is always fresh and hot right off the stove! You can't go wrong here, make sure you get the Carne Asada!",2
"I need to tell you about the worst hostess experience I've EVER had anywhere. Ann was unable and unwilling to even pretend to try and accomodate our simple seating request to have our 2 parties sit near each other, even though I'd made my reservation 2 weeks in advance withthat specific request. Her attitude was unacceptable.",1
"Omlete spinach was to watered down for me . The French toast was ok . The potatoes were on the soft side I like my potatoes on the crunchy side. The decor was on the outdated side. But I did like our servers she was very nice that's why I gave the place 2stars instead of 1 star , I have had much better breakfast I don't think I will be returning , I really want it to like this place.",1
No wonder seats arent filled up at this dennys. The waiter was very unhappy and seemed like he hated his job. Service was bad. Food was very bland. They charged one of my friends wrong. Added an extra oj to his bill. Never coming here again! ! Stay away. P.s bathrooms had blood on the walls and no toilet paper !,1
"I love this place! I'd love it more if it was a few miles east, that is closer to my house. The dosa was wonderful, the puri with chick peas was divine. The thali was good although the okra was tough. I liked my uttapam but it isn't the best I've had. I would prefer silverware over plastic and plates over paper, oh well. Woodlands is my new favorite stop for Indian food in the valley.",2
Another great visit nFriendly and quick service. Taco Tuesday 99ea nChoriqueso burrito with chips meal very filling. 3 taco w chips great. 1 beef good 2 chicken tasty moist . nChoriqueso dip little greasy like meat wasn't drained but still yummy took what was left home! nPlantains with yogurt sauce such a yummy desert!,2
My wife a regular for over a year had a terrible skin reaction around the edge of her hair after coloring. Called Vincent the manager who said he would investigate and get back to her last we heard from him. This was the last straw and she is switching salons now. 40 for a straightforward blow dry after a treatment too. Just crazy. Go elsewhere,1
"If you've ever had good Mexican food then you DO NOT want to eat here. The food was mediocre at best. The only reason for the 2 stars is the service. The host and wait staff were very pleasant, but other than that the food was terrible. You are better off crossing the street to Smokehouse. We had dinner there the next day and it was fantastic. Skip this place and cross the street.",1
"We had a later dinner here on the night of our arrival. Ate at the bar, service was great. Shared a beef carpaccio, a caesar salad, and spaghetti and meatballs. The carpaccio and the salad were great, the spaghetti was fine, the meatballs were SO DRY. All in all, not a bad meal, but nothing to write home about and nothing to bring us back with all the delicious options in Vegas.",1
"My flight was significantly delayed because some socialist toolbag on a tax payer purchased jumbo jet decided that his fundraising was more important than the needs of the tax paying citizens of the United States. Anyway, gotta love an airport that has slot machines in the terminals! If you didn't waste all of your money on the strip, you have one last shot at going completely broke! Wheeee!",2
"The place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control. I cant imagine a more unrelaxing setting. The food, while there was alot of it, was mediocre at best and at 11 dollars a person, not worth it IMO. The best part was that the drink was included in the price. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",1
"Long wait for food about an hour. portions were small. Waiter was awesome. not the macaroni grill I remember from years ago. it needs to bring back bigger portions and and speed up the chefs, the place was empty and we had to wait an hour for our food. nour waiter was the best i have ever seen, fast friendly and nice",1
I usually love Lowe's. But I ordered a kitchen cabinet and it came with incorrect doors. I have already been back to the store seven times and it is still not resolved. The store manager twice assured me that the correct doors would be ordered. Excuse after excuse but no doors. This has been going on for two months. The problem was made worse by the incompetent employees in the cabinet department.,1
First time being here. Food was actually pretty good. only reason it's getting 2 stars is because the service absolutely sucked. Our server Tommy was no were to be seen. Never got a refill at all. He pretty much just walked around real quick and disappeared for awhile. Came back out for like a second and disappeared again. Never came and asked if we were doing good or if we needed anything.,1
I ordered a pair of shoes with a saleslady at this location. She was super friendly and professional. When I went pin to pick up the shoes another super friendly staff member was there to help me! I left feeling very happy and excited for my wedding. I should have gone here and not Northlake to buy my dress! !,2
"Please mail me your 30 and I'll send you more interesting CSI material than this exhibit. Or better yet, just watch the tv show for free My girlfriend was a huge CSI fan so she enjoyed it. But my CSI experience is near zero and that's how I felt after it was all over. Kids will enjoy this exhibit if they are smart and like to pay attention.",1
"Best Nail Salon in Las Vegas! The salon is so zen and the customer service is amazing! I send anybody that mentions nails here. I have been in Las Vegas for 18 years and gone to many salons, this is the best! They have a huge assortment of gels colors and a rewards program as well. So many good things to list",2
"This is a beautiful intimate ballpark. We usually bring a blanket and our fan gear and sit out in the grass behind the outfield. Weather is usually beautiful for Spring Training, but last year we were hailed on! Still love coming out to see our Giants play in Arizona. Makes a great family get away in March or April.",2
"This show was so much fun! Dinner AND a show?! How can it get much better?! Its great how they interact with the audience and make it fun. The food is so good and you eat with your hands! The beer is served cold and you get to cheers or as they say ""hazah! "" with it in your huge frosty mug! A bit pricey, but well worth it. I am an adult and it made me feel like a kid again ",2
"I like Paris hotel but it can be expensive. So staying at Bally's is the next best thing because it's attached to Paris. The lobby, restaurants, and shopping areas at Paris are nice. You actually feel like you're in Paris. Fitness fees are outrageous. Same goes for Paris's fitness area. But this is right in the heart of the best part of the strip. Everything is within walking distance.",2
"The UPS store close to home I frequent. Now, Ups is a little more expensive than USPS but they have tremendous customer service and some of the best shipping packages domestically and internationally around. The store itself carries all your normal shipping supplies for sale and the employees are very informative and helpful in assessing your individual needs.",2
"Second time there and I'll be back again! Great service! nWarm atmosphere. nDelicious food! Their table bread is addicting, chicken Marsala melting, and spaghetti and meatballs savory. They have great marinara here! High on my list. I felt guilty walking out of the restaurant, staring into the Bikram Yoga studio next door! I go there, too ",2
"Great service from Dallas our server but most importantly, phenomenal eats. This place has all the character and ""casualness "" that you want from your favorite burger joint, but with an elevated and surprising amount of craft in the food. Truly delicious and thoughtful preparation an unreserved recommendation.",2
"Probably the worst run club in Vegas. Me and 2 of my friends had table reservations. Problem was, we could not even get close to he guy with the clipboard. The place has no formal line or and type of order. Also the fact is was a complete sausage fest there. I mean it must have been 3 1 guys there. We left within 30 mins.",1
"I would much rather grab a drink fresh drink from Squeeze than a overly sweet vodka slurpee when I am on the Strip. This walk up bar offers some super refreshing mixed drinks! My favorite has lavender soda and tequila. I imagine it would be the perfect Las Vegas Strip hangover spot! Giver this little stop a chance, the bartenders are very cool and always willing to cater to your needs!",2
"I love this salon! Clean, vibrant, busy and everyone is so friendly and genuine. Laurie Roth is the BEST for awesome cuts AND color.hard to find that in just one person. Her rates are great, and she is very knowledgable and passionate about what she does.and that's why I will be back again and again.",2
"It used to b amazing, still is pretty good. Cappuccinos were the best in town but they seem to have redefined the formulations of lattes and cappuccinos since they got taken over by the owners of the other downtown AJ. If you used to like cappuccinos, go for the lattes now. Cappuccinos are much stronger than they used to be.",2
Went for brunch today and food was utter disappointment. My smoked salmon sandwich was destroyed by thick layer of mustard. Any cook should know that mustard can easily overpower any dish and who puts mustard on smoked salmon? Overall everything including bread was just dripping with some grease or oil. Huge bush of greens was also dripping with some oily dressing. Low quality food.,1
"Absolute GARBAGE! The waiter bragged how they were better than Texas De Brazil which is actually comical. Service was horrible, food was cafeteria quality at best and NEVER do a Groupon there as they have some tiny print that says you need 4 full paying customers to use it at 50 a pop. Worst seafood ever.Imagine eating at Dennys for 50 a plate! Save your money.trust me on this.",1
"Breaking News, When you book through Expedia you DON'T get points w JW. This is just dumb, how forward thinking of this company. This is not professional and I will never stay at a Marriott again, and I am an elite level Marriott Rewards cloent. Hmm. All this so they can save the 5 bucks they have to pay Expedia for their service.",1
"Let me start off by saying, this place has no sushi bar! Why didn't someone's review say that? To me, sushi is a experience, I love watching and interacting with my chef. The sushi wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.Price was also on the high side. Was very disappointed. Just seemed like mall sushi.",1
Susan is a real professional gives a GREAT massage. After only one session with her my body was already feeling much more relaxed. She's got the healing touch brings lots of experience to her work which your sore muscles achy bones will benefit from thank you for! Would definitely recommend her to anyone visiting LV wish she had a Hired Hands outpost here in Manhattan!,2
"I came here for a couple's 50 minute massage back iovember.it came with a package deal that i bought with room, gambling money, etc for the palazzo. the experience was great! the facility was huge and it was my bf's first time getting a massage.and he enjoyed it too!.we didn't go try any of the spas other amenities.just the massage and relaxation room, then back to our room to pack and check out.",2
"Terrible. I really should have learned my lesson after the first time, so maybe I'm really to blame. Every damn time they mess up my order. Pretty sure they straight give me someone else's food. The fries ALWAYS taste like they were cooked yesterday, stale and cold. I've found more edible fries under the seat of my car. nWhat a waste. It shouldn't be this difficult to get a quick burger.",1
"Frequent their quite often, will probably never go back after tonight. Rich is gone from what I hear and the bartender tonight in his place had quite the attitude. She might get her drinks right if she got off her phone while making them. Sounds like Rich went to Sago's I will be spending my money their instead.",1
"This is my favorite ""pizza by the slice "" place in AZ. They always have a nice array of different pizzas out there. I usually end up with a something simple like a slice of pepperoni jalapenos. This is as close as you get to a ""big city "" pizza joint in AZ. Haven't tried it yet? Do yourself a favor and make your way over to Slices and grab a bite.",2
"This is our default Piper. We have had several birthdays, nights out and just some play time here through out the years. Our most recent visit was for a birthday. They handled it perfectly, the kids stayed entertained, the adults stayed cool and the birthday girl had a good time. The pizza seemed to get better then 10 years ago, the staff was great, and there was plenty of room for everyone.",2
"My wife and I Saw Bill Cosby over the 2009 summer. Great time. We sat in the upper balcony but there really wasn't a bad seat in the house. Love the location. Streets surrounding the Overture had caf u00e9's, a few shops, and steps away from the capitol building. Love to go back for another event. Madison, WI was a very nice place to visit. We want to visit again.",2
"My boyfriend and I dined here on a groupon. I would have been unhappy if we paid menu prices, they were high based on the quality and portion size of the food The biggest disappointment here was the service. The restaurant was very slow during our visit, many empty tables, yet it took forever to get a refill on a drink and our check once we had finished dining.",1
"Love, love, love this place. From the outside it looks like a place I probably would not eat t. One burger and fries and I'm in love! I would not bother eating a burger anywhere else. I would just wind up being sad that it was not a Benny's burger! Go once and be hooked! They also have a lot of different stuff on their menu, I've never been willing to forgo the burger!",2
"My ABSOLUTELY favorite place to eat in Scottsdale, hands down. The Rueben sandwich is exquisite and piled high with meat. The menu has cute names and is very descriptive. The food is fresh and of the highest quality. The service is very good and the server is friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and very charming. My next stop in Arizona won't be complete food wise without a trip to Cowboy Ciao!",2
"Went to Dr. Moss for my first ever annual I was nervous but Dr. Moss knew her stuff and made me feel really comfortable, she's gentle, the staff was friendly, office is well kept and I wasn't there long. She even congratulated me for going through my very first annual! haha. I definitely recommend Dr. Moss!",2
"I don't usually take taxis very often, but I recently need to take an early morning flight, so I looked up a couple reviews online and decided to give R H Cab a try. Let's just keep it simple and say that I will always choose R H Cab anytime in the future when I need a taxi. in fact, I created a yelp account just to write this review.",2
"Terrible experience, their restaurant was so dirty, that I felt a bit discussed to eat there. their floor was almost black, their table super dirty and yeap. I even got a hair on my food. they do offer an extend menu, but truly the entire place looks like the have a very poor hygiene. their stuff was not very friendly and their whole ordering system was a bit disorganized.",1
"This bar could be so much.but is very lacking. The decor is lackluster, the food leaves something to be desired. We had the arancini, chicken parm sliders and mozzarella en carrozza fancy grilled cheese . The grilled cheese was awful, the other two were mediocre at best. Downtown has better offerings.skip this place.",1
"I see that this place is still as filthy as it was when I wrote my first review. It made CBS channel 5's dirty dining list tonight! In fact, they were the dirtiest of them all with a whopping 12 major violations from the health department. Wow. The news said if they do not correct they may get shut down. I think this would be a good idea and could keep people from getting sick.",1
The place is really good and so cute! Went here for lunch with my aunt portions are great! You get free fresh croissants and the service is excellent. Limited parking and the bathroom when I went was inside the restaurant since we ate at the bistro. Very busy place. Reasonable pricing for the food and the venue! I will be back ,2
"Dr George is hands down THE BEST VET my family has ever had! nHis kindness and knowledge set him miles apart form any vet we have been to. My dad moved from LA Im from Boston, we trust him, and only him to look after our beloved MUSH! Thank you Dr George for all taking care of our dog, we love him and trust him in your hands. He is healthy and happier because of you. Lisa, Fred George Gennawey",2
My partner ate both lunch and dinner there the other night and ended up so sick I had to fly to vegas to take care of her. She had steelhead for lunch had to send it back to cook it more as it was raw should have been her first clue and oysters with a salad for dinner. She spent the night getting intimate with the toilet and the garbage caext to it. She will never go there again. Steer clear.,1
"Ordered two hot dogs big mistake and ended up putting one in the fridge in the hotel room. Opened the fridge a few hours later to discover a very odd smell coming from it. Was hoping to eat it for breakfast the next morning before checkout, but ended up trashing it instead. That pretty much sums up my experience with Pink's. A great big MEH.",1
"The place is small. The door in unmarked but you can find it by the wonderful aroma of pork cooking. My favorite dish there is the Carne Adovada. Im drool ing as I wrtie this. It's my favorite breakfast whenever I come to Phoenix. Start with a plate of beans, potatoes. Top that with a heaping mound of tender pork. Top it with a fried egg and you wont leave hungry!",2
My boss says his body is a temple and won't eat anywhere else but Blue Fin. So he took me there for my birthday. So good.their salad has an amazing dressing not sure what the taste is . The ladies knew my boss and were very personable. I go back often. I get the teriyaki chicken with brown rice. Reasonably priced and the ladies are so sweet.,2
UPDATE I am incredibly taken back that the owner had the nerve to come on here in a sad attempt to discredit my honest review. I also find it funny that there is a review from the same week complaining of getting sick off the food and she's badgering that reviewer as well. Tacky business practice. Very tacky.,1
"Rising sun burger teriyaki too sweet nSweet potato fries decent, but same ol' same ol'. nEl machete no heat, no flavor except pepper jack cheese. Meat by itself wasn't that tasty. nBuffalo chicken dip was more cheesy than buffalo y. Had better and have made better. nOnion rings whatever Too many good burger joints in Vegas to come back here.",1
Food was good. I had a turkey and salami. My mom had a turkey rueben. Don't know what these other people are talking about. They obviously haven't eaten at a deli before. My sandwich 8.50. I have been at delis and had the same thing for 16.95. The only negative is the whole hotel carries Pepsi products.,2
"After two years, this is still my go to nail salon. What I really love about it the most is that it is consistent. I ALWAYS get the best service and they are always looking for ways to improve. My gel polish is always done right and always beautiful and it lasts. They have great hours, nice location and will take good care of you.",2
"If you can, avoid this CVS location at all costs! The product is under stocked meaning that several items are not even available. The staff is wildly unhelpful and the machine that you can use to print your coupons in store is so archaic that it can't read the mobile cards or access your account by entering your phone number. A colossal waste of time and energy. I'm sorry I stopped here.",1
"Good service, and okay wine selection. Food was below average lack of flavor, not cooked to correct temperate. So many people have recommend this as a must try restaurant, it is not worth a 2nd visit. Prices are priced well for the items they sold however the quality of ingredients and preparation of food served was equal to a home prepared meal.",1
"We were told to try the calamari appetizer but it's presented as a salad which is not conducive to sharing. Instead, we shared the zucca chips fantastic! , bruschetta fair , garlic bread pretty good . All three dinners were excellent. The only complaint is that the restaurant's noise level is very high so difficult to have a conversation.",2
Need a NEW menu that describes what you are serving people! Butter salad was all field greens with a couple pieces of butter lettuce. Quinoa and bulgar wheat side dish was mostly arugula with a little quinoa. Salmon was served dry and overcooked. I had to cut it with a knife! Noisy. Came home hungry!,1
"I went to Brocach with a friend for lunch on a Thursday afternoon, and it was great! The atmosphere was inviting and warm, and created an idea of what the style of the restaurant was like immediately. The restaurant wasn't crowded, so we sat down right away, and our waiter was friendly and prompt. We both loved our wraps and sandwiches, I will definitely head back!",2
"I'm a Walmart fan and I can only say this, the main water fountains at this location was out for several weeks. It's not necessarily located in a savory part of town, but the prices were the same inside as they would be anywhere else so. They had some hard working employees also but avoid this one if you can.",1
If there was a minus 5 this place would get it. Way way way overpriced horrible massage paid for an hour but she gave me 30 mins of slapping oil on me. Do not go here. Then they call a cab I go outside and it's some guy in a Hyundai not a taxi but at that point I wanted to get away as fast as possible.,1
"Okay, THIS place is the bomb diggity! They are pretty reasonably priced for the amount of food they give you and oh. the food! Super delicious! I've had a few different things there now and I'm NEVER let down! Their French Onion soup is delicious and the cobb salad was outstanding! My ex always get their 4 cheese macaroni and LOVES it! You can NEVER go wrong with Wally's! ",2
"I'm not sure that's it's fair that I review this place, because we didn't actually eat here. Heck, we didn't even sit down. We walked in on a Friday night around 7 for dinner. Inside smelled like a hospital and when we found our way down the hallway, there were probably 6 tables out of 30 filled, and everyone there was eligible for a Medicare card. We didn't stay.",1
"Really cute place with an old school candy shop feel. Actually, they do sell random candy on site. jawbreakers and the like. Staff is friendly and helpful. The Vietnamese coffee is my go to flavor.The boyfriend loves the butter pecan. Only gripe is I wish they had more flavors and they rotated them more. They have around 10 flavors. Also parking is not all that available.",2
"I've been coming here for years for service. Overall they do good work. It's clean and reasonably priced. Eyebrow wax is a good deal too. I got the new girl ""Nancy "". She is very gentle and thorough. She actually speaks English and was making conversation with me. Thanks ""Nancy "". Update post pedicure ""NANCY "" IS AWESOME! The best pedicure I've ever had here! Go see her! 5 stars!",2
"Super fratty and yuppie, but what can you expect with the location. If polo shirts tucked into khaki shorts on drunk frat boys is your scene then this is this is the spot for you. Not my favorite place. Went to eat here one Sunday for lunch and the place was still filthy from the night before. Just reminds me of a frat house with a kitchen.",1
I've been here multiple times and enjoy it each time. I went during the Christmas season for their Christmas themed skating night. Fun place to take some pictures and have fun with friends. I suggest getting there when each session opens so you can get the right size and nicer shoes to use. I will definitely be coming back here.,2
During my visit I wanted to meet up with my family for some coffee and pan dulce. I was pleasantly surprised to find both. I actually ended up getting their green juice which was definitely green! You can ask for a custom blend and their selection is pretty decent for a small cafe. There's limited seating so expect to wait during rush hours but after 9am not too busy.,2
Perfect spot for lunch. A nice and relaxing vibe by the pool. Perfect place to have a light meal and sip on white vino or sangria to keep a nice day buzz going. n I enjoyed just kicking back and people watching while eating and sipping on my vino.a little hard to find but worth it IMO. The hostess the front desk needed a bloody mary more than my friends hahaha n0 o,2
"Great AYCE spot! They have a variety of dishes, all of which were very tasty. My favorite was the samosa dipped in the yogurt sauce or mint chutney. Also great was the channa masala. It had a great heat and was spiced nicely. I thought the garlic naan was a bit too garlicky but that's just my palate. The waiter was not very attentive and slow to refill our drinks.",2
I wish I would have read these reviews before using Dugan plumbing. Probably would have saved 2 grand. I can't say for certain that I was taken advantage of but I can say their follow up is the worst. Had problems after they fixed my pipes and it took 2 weeks to get a response. When they did respond they were rude. Try someone else.,1
"Beautiful hotel, huge. Service great, friendly, consistent nFood options good nAtmosphere good for conventions family nRooms huge, all rooms corner view, views and technology are great. nLocation on the strip, perfect. Like the hotel but didn't love because was a very corporate vibe and a little too large fort liking but overall a good property.",2
"The whole tour barrel ride and tasting borders on being cheesy, but informative. Kind of like going to Disneyland to learn about how it's a small world after all. But if you're ready to embrace the cheese and learn a little bit about how whisky is made and learn a little bit about Scotland geography from a whisky glass , then this is a must see.",2
I placed an ordered here about a month ago and just forgot to do this review so here it is. I had the chicken wing and pizza deal the wings were soggy but flavorful and the pizza was cold and bland. I literally ate one slice and threw the rest of the pizza away a few days later. I did warm up the wings and eat those but this is a place I will not be ordering from again.,1
I went to this place once and NEVER going back! The most dirtiest place I ever been to.How the hell are you going to have your employee sweep the floor while people are eating. DUST is flying everywhere. Price is alright and pho is not the best. Please try giving your customer more than one meatball that is not cut into quarter.,1
"Have visited BabyStacks a few times. I like the wide variety of options for pancakes. The servings aren't huge, but acceptable. I think the prices are good for what you get. Love the lemon curd they use, and the cream cheese syrup is yummy! I'd give 5 stars, but the wait can be ridiculous. If we go, we always do a late lunch, right before they close.",2
"I wouldn't say Famous Dave's is great BBQ it is great food. Everything on the menu is delicious and is always consistent, a bit too consistent. While I do love everything about Famous Dave's, it's not true BBQ. This location has friendly staff, is always clean and never too busy to just walk right it.",2
"Came here last night Saturday for the Reggae Ska music with a few friends. The place was pretty dead but the DJ was playing rad music and the drinks were cheap! 13.50 for a round of drinks for me and my 3 friends? We're in! The bartender was a really cool chick, too. Thanks for digging out that Red Stripe for my friend. nI'll definitely be coming back again the next time I'm in town!",2
We went here for brunch and let me just say Delicious my husband and I had the famous Andy's sage fried chicken Benedict and the banana flapjacks nThe meal fed both of us nThe flapjacks also fed both of us amazing Definitely going to keep coming back here every time I'm in Vegas nI forgot the waitresses name but she did a outstanding job in customer service,2
I was a little skeptical at first because I am accustomed to good Mexican food coming from California. The grilled chicken salad was delicious especially topped off with the tomatillo dressing. Green creamy is the one you want. The staff was friendly and even hooked it up with a free drink since they put pulled chicken in my salad when I wanted the grilled.,2
"Notes to self I haven't had anything bad here, and every time I'm in town I come here at least twice. The buffalo chicken is a winner for lunch. The java mocha blast is better than the breakfast buzz at delish. I should try breakfast sandwiches next time I am around. Closed Mondays which is kind of a bummer. Fyi the Wi Fi password is on the receipt",2
"The Ruben egg rolls are so unique and delicious. Our dinner was also very good.we ate the Thai chicken and a half roasted chicken not sure what it was called . Both of these entrees were massive and very tasty. I knocked it down a star because the service was average. But above all, the mango ipa was the best!",2
"Holy Guacamolito! this is the best salsa I have ever tasted. It is green and mild and I suggest eating it with Los Arcos local Tortilla shop chips because this is as close to homemade as you can get. I found both products at Whole Foods Fort Apache. This stuff is dangerous, half my bag of chips is gone and I am on my way out the door for a jog.",2
"First, the pizza was great. Probably in the top three I've had in Phoenix. Second, the delivery got screwed up. Third, when I called in, Christine the manager SWIFTLY took care of the issue and made me fully satisfied. It was obvious that she is a professional, and has high standards for customer service. I'll order from them again.",2
I took a pair of courderoy jeans in for a simple 1 2' tear repair. The woman ran the sewing machine over the material about 50 times leavong a 2 3 inch mess of scarring over the material. When I asked her WHAT she had done She started screaming.at ME! I asked her to stop screaming and being rude and she just got worse Avoid the place!,1
"Why 4 stars? Because I don't have many complaints. It's hard to review an airport after just spending a layover or two there. But here's what I know. 1 I had my first Bo Jangles experience here. 2 This place is the people mover capital of the world. 2 is unofficial, but my God. there are more people movers than people here.",2
"My favorite thing at Scarpetta is the meat bread and it's not even something you order! I came here with a big group of girls as part of a bachelorette weekend. The ambiance is very classy and the service is impeccable. I ordered the pici pasta amazing! Since then, I've heard that the dish they're known for is the spaghetti, so I'll have to try it sometime when I get the chance. L.",2
"I am not a fan of Phillip Pelusi hair salons. I have been to several different locations Bloomfield, Sq. Hill, South Side, and Robinson and I always thought the prices, regardless of range, were too high considering the skill and personality of the stylist. They never call to remind of the appointment either, which I think should be a common courtesy these days.",1
"Yay a new hip coffee shop. I didn't get to hang out very long but nI could see myself sipping a latte, reading a book and getting cozy for awhile at Central. It's a little hard to get to since you can't turn left from Central but its well worth the hassle. Service was top notch, and my coffee was just perfect. If your a coffee snob like me check this place out you won't be disappointed.",2
Hellooooo shrimp tacos! All I can say is wow. The food is amazing and the chips and salsa are as good as I have ever had. I am a big fan of the Scottsdale location primarily because of the patio and fire pits. My wife and I go often and enjoy freshly squeezed margs and salty dogs. Highly recommend a visit.,2
"Good stuff! Bartenders are very attentive, entertaining, attractive, and make good drinks! What more could you ask for. Their boss isn't bad either. Shout out to ""The Man "" from down under D Thanks for a lovely time even though we actually had to pay for our drinks. what.? us, pay? lol Worth stopping by if you're at the Cosmopolitan.",2
"The restaurant is in the process of refurbish, just so readers of older reviews know. The owner was very nice. The green chili omelet was ok. The potatoes were not hot. It's not easy to find a breakfast joint just by driving around if you're from out of state. We found this place via Google and it was close to our hotel, but we probably won't go there tomorrow since it was just ok.",1
"I use this place constantly. The only place In town for decaf PG tip tea. nI buy sausage, Yorkshire puddings, and pies English style. I buy all my curries and sauces, Indian, and Chinese. nChristmas goodies are phenomenal, and half the price of Cost Plus or other gourmet shops. nFresh products are excellent but much is beyond my culinary skills and aimed for Asian restaurants.",2
"An excellent handyman, Pete was very efficient and was able to take care of my toilet repair needs easily and for a reasonable price. I would definitely use him again for any problems around the home, like water leaks, electrical issues, etc. He knows what to do and comes prepared, which are rare to find in any repairmen these days!",2
"Chocolate chocolate everywhere fondu, mounds, drinks, cakes, with ice cream, brownies . We didn't have any. What we did have were buckwheat crepes which were great. There are maybe a dozen varieties, mine was with chicken, spinach and goat cheeze. Totally enjoyable and unique. It's not a ""stuff yourself "" meal but well worth going for.",2
"Not all dentists are created equal. Dr. Linker has to be the most gentle dentist I've ever experienced. Had a filling re done recently and hardly felt the anesthetic even go in! The office is very clean, modern and professional. The staff is great too. They're all very friendly and really make you feel comfortable.",2
"Here's a place that cares about my satisfaction. I wasn't pleased with the first attempt at cleaning my carpet, mats and seats, but after I let them know that I was dissatisfied with the quality, they were more than willing to fix it. I always come here and ALWAYS leave happy. Thanks to Drew and the guys, I'll continue to come back. Thanks Drew, for making my experience great!",2
"This is a review for a year ago. Horrible experience and needed to make sure I change my review. Watered down soy sauce? Enough said. This little Japanese restaurant has only one bad thing.and that is their slow service hence, minus 1 star . Other than that, the food is delish and the price isn't too bad either. PS. They always have coupons available online so that's really nice! ",1
"I went to have dinner there and the service was not great at all, it took them 20 minutes to finally acknowledge I was there and asked if I wanted a menu. I ordered sliders and a drink, it had nothing special to it, the food is less than average. I would rather go to BJs down the street on Decatur than bother going there again. Waste of time, waste of money.",1
"In some circles, referred to simply as ""The Palace, "" this place has a solid lunch buffet and good service. Priced at about 10 per person for a variety of good Indian food, it's a lunch time slam dunk every time. although adding a couple more dishes to the mix would be ideal. It's an OK value for dinner, although, in my opinion, slightly overpriced for good, but not out of this world, Indian.",2
"As far as GE's go, this location is great. It has basically everything you need and is well organized. You can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you can't get at other GE stores. They also offer a wine kiosk, hot bar, salad bar, and bulk olives. I would venture to say this is better than the market district.",2
"Got dragged in today by my friend cause she wanted to try it. I can say it was still awful like it was the first time I was here, food was cold, dishes were dirty and food was salty and oily. Wish I could say something nice but the only thing that was good was the service but I'm not here for the service. Maybe they need a new chef.",1
Very very bad service. In the drive thru fur 15minutes when I got to order was told that I caot have a four piece meal all thighs. nWas told to come back in 20minutes .I was already in line for 15 minutes. Was told that he needs the thighs for the big family meals people are ordering.ohh I am sorry that I don't have a family to feed. Avoid this location.,1
"Bonnie's Barkery carries most of the high end, organic, natural, etc., etc. dog and cat foods available in major markets. I like the fact that they don't sell anything that is not natural, such as cheap rawhide chews. Lots of great interactive dog toys, deer antlers, tough toys, frozen raw diets and bones. We are so fortunate to have this great shop in our neighborhood!",2
I lived in AZ for a year and this was my hang out. It was great when it was a HOOKAH BAR and now they are trying to do this night club thing and I HATE IT! The food isn't anything special the service is OK. Now it is only a 21 and up inside deal which it wasn't before and there is no hookah. I don't like what it turned into the old La PIta was GREAT now i got nothing.,1
"TWO WORDS Overhyped and overpriced! I swear we paid 14 for a simple ice blended hot chocolate! No joke, it WAS good. However, not at all worth 14. I think I'd be just as satisfied ordering a 4 Cappucino Blast at Baskin Robbins, despite the calories. I'll come back and give their food a try but next time, I'll just make my own froyo at home.",1
"Hands down the BEST pad thai I've tried in my entire life. It was my first time having pumpkin curry, but I don't think anything could top the experience here. Chunks of soft, buttery pumpkin with a light coconut milk infused curry sauce. I wanted to lick the plate when I was done. Nice decor, service was quick and polite, and this place is open late. What more could a college foodie ask for?",2
"I brought my dog here to get spayed. The customer service was warm and friendly. The veterinarian explained the procedure thoroughly. The veterinarian assistant explained the healing process, and the effects of the meds. The day after the procedure I received a call checking on my dog, which I appreciated. I will definitely bring my dog back again!",2
"I was able to come in, pick out 3 tops that were really nice when they were clearly really busy and they got me a dressing room within seconds upstairs in the mens department. The staff was really helpful and accommodating when I asked if they had a different size. I will certainly be back for some more clothes.",2
I love this place. The drinks are strong and tasty. To all those people bitching about it being smokey. its a freaking bar! I dont smoke but i know im in a bar so its no big deal. The parking is no fun but the drinks are well worth it. Try to get there a little early so you can grab a nice table to sit at. Makes a nice date night fellas.,2
"Awesome brunch experience. I had the breakfast jambalaya it was excellent, full of flavor. I had trouble deciding what to order with all the delicious sounding, unique items on the menu. Gotta love a place that offers 4 different versions of eggs benedict, YUM! Great service as well. Will definitely be coming back, maybe to try their dinner menu sometime.",2
"I spent about an hour and a half here on Christmas day. What a gem. I didn't eat here so I can't comment on the food but the atmosphere,service and the general vibe of the place is awesome. We had so much fun here we went back a few days later and had an even better time. We met tons of locals. They pour a decent Guinness. Little Crown and Anchor will be on my list whenever I'm in Vegas.",2
"All I can say is ""Wow! "" nI tried these guys because they had a booth set up at Denim and Diamonds. Oh my.I am so glad I tried the brisket sandwich. It was warm drippy barbecued delightfulness! I highly recommend a trip to this eatery. You will not be let down. I would drive from Tempe, Chandler, or even Scottsdale for another sandwich!",2
"Thank you Discount Tire for your service this past weekend with the purchase of a new tire to replace a flat that I had. You went above and beyond helping me get the right tire for my car. While you have always had the best prices in the past when we have purchased tires, the statement of ""INTEGRITY "" hanging in your stores is very accurate and most definitely applied.",2
"We didn't stay here, but spent a lot of our time in Vegas inside the Bellagio. The gardens are breathtaking, wow! Overall, the hotel has been kept up well and is pleasant to walk around. Many nice eateries, a pretty good buffet, breathtaking glass ceiling in the lobby, and even a tram to Aria and City Center now.",2
"i have been to this place 5 times.EVERY time i feel like i get treated differently than everyone else. Most of their clients are as we call them ""gringos "" I immediatly notice the differnent attention I get for being a latina.but it still does not stop me from buying their amazing cakes. ive tried all of them best is the whitechocolate raspberry, worst is lkemon tastes like made out of a box.",1
"My son's and I really had a good time at ""It's Tricky. "" It is a family friendly show, my boys are 7 and 10, and they both had as much fun as I did. Definitely recommended if you are looking for some quality, family entertainment. Kyle is funny, witty, and has some old school tricks, as well as some new ones, that were pretty amazing.",2
"Wanna get your late night grub on, go here! Been going here now for almost 2 years and it's by far my favorite place. I always end up going after work and it does get packed. Sometimes the service can be shifty because they have such an overflow and limited staff but be patient because the food is amazing. Marinated pork belly, korean short ribs, and some of the best salad ever!",2
"This RA is an ASU staple. Been coming here since I was a freshman back in 2003. Hasn't changed too much! Great happy hour. The cripsy rice spicy tuna roll is awesome! Definitely get that. I really enjoyed my mango martini as well. They are a little soy saucy here with the yellowtail and albacore nigiri, but didn't bother me too much. I especially love the quick service here. Cheers!",2
"The atmosphere is very inviting and great, flavorful food to top it off. The spice in the calamari is spot on and the LA lasagna is out of this world. With a great view and solid price range this is one restaurant.on the strip that seems like it was almost made for the local and tourist alike. A must see for good food and even better times.",2
We went here for the first time last weekend. My husband asked the waitress if the jamaican jerk chicken wings were sweet or spicy and her response was eeh. He then asked her if they were hot and she again respnded eeh! The service was terrible and we probably wouldn't go there again. 4.00 for a draft beer is a bit much for the during the football game special. Pizza was okay but not that great.,1
"Whenever I have a craving for Mexican Food, this place satisfies. Been eating here like 3 4 times in the last week. The only downfall is that the food will slow you down for a few hours afterward but is worth it sometimes. Dishes I love this week plato de asada, beef burro big burrito , lunch asada with rice and beans. All fabulous!",2
"Place is expensive but I love that the three little aisles that they have are nice to look at. It's a little bigger than the store at Tropicana and Pecos. I love the rice balls and the bento looked good. They have the same things as the store down at rainbow, but in small quantities. The thing I totally love is the loud in your face music! Haha will be returning.",2
"Food is very bland, overpriced even for Montreal and tasteless. Decor is sort of interesting, service was pretty good. Drinks were reasonable. Not bad for just a drink, but I can't fathom how you can screw up guacamole that bad. The fajitas we ordered were, again, very bland. I had to cover them with table hotsauce to get them to sing even a little. Portion was big, though, plenty for two.",1
"What amazing service! Their service sets them apart from all other Thai restaurants in the area. Authentic dishes are made to order. We went with a large group, and every person was happy with the food and experience. I highly recommend visiting them NOTE Their sign above the building actually says 'Pink Pepper', but the door says Tara Thai.",2
"Sweet service and excellent food. I am not a foodie, so I am always impressed with food no matter the place. I had the meatloaf amazing! with a side of zucchini and the chopped salad. My friend split an order of scallops with her husband. If you are in Scottsdale, or anywhere in the East Valley area, stop by. We loved it and will return.",2
"If you are looking for the freshest seafood in town, this is the best place to go. The portions are perfect, where you are satisfied but not overwhelmingly stuffed. The food feels more organic and clean in that I feel they use simple ingredients and don't try to add to many ""fillers "" for taste. If I was to pick anywhere in Birmingham to impress someone, this would be my choice.",2
"Perfect location, good food and awesome service is what makes Le Thai absolutely delightful. I have liked everything I ever tried here but Chicken fried rice and yellow curry are my favorite.Their spice level does vary at times, like a 3 would be spicy for me at times and sometimes even a 4 wouldn't be that spicy.That is not much of a problem though.",2
"Went for a friend's birthday. Bought a bottle, to stand in the middle of a crowded room. Ended with a bill that was way too expensive compare to what we took already expensive ! Really rude doormen. A group of 6 that will a never come back b that will not provide any positive feedback to any of our friends.",1
"I have had really good experiences at several other Brakes Plus locations in the past, but my first experience with the Signal Butte Brakes Plus could not have been any worse. This is a very seedy and disingenuous group of guys at this location and I strongly advise anyone who is looking for honesty and integrity to steer clear of this place.WAY CLEAR!",1
The group of us went here for dinner while in Vegas for a trade show we were working last week. If it was possible to give ZERO stars I would have done it! To much went wrong with the service to bother breaking down .my advice DON'T waste your money here when there are so many other options! Never again!,1
"The restaurant decor is really cute. But that's it. The service didn't terribly suck, it was just typical. I ordered the fruity tutti drink, it was really good. To eat? I ordered the chili cheese dog, because i mean how could you mess up a chili cheese dog. The bun was very hard. Disappointed. I tried my friend's burger, it was ok. not the best. The food here is quite expensive though.",1
"They said i was out of their zone, and had to talk with them for 15 minutes to explain to them that I am in their zone after the same person kept putting me on hold and hanging up on me. I will rate it better when i try their pizza, ordered somewhere else in between trying to confirm i'm in the area and getting hung up on.",1
"Handmade pizza the way it was meant to be! Not bastardized and has fresh ingredients. My favourite is mushroom, garlic and olives. Their pastas are super tasty as well however you haven't lived until you've tried one of their AMAZING CANOLES! Crispy golden casing dusted with warm cinnamon and a rich creamy texture on the inside not too sweet. I'm hungry!",2
I stopped in for lunch and it was delicious. I was torn or what to order and the young lady behind the counter suggested a rice bowl. She was very friendly and made a great suggestion. The rice bowl is more then enough for me to eat today and tomorrow. The owner was working the grill and very friendly. Great food and quality service. 2 thumbs up!,2
"Very disappointed! I spent 12 on 2 sides of veggies thinking I would have leftovers to take with me on the plane. NOT! I ordered the collards and maybe had enough for 3 bites! I work for a major airline, and I can guarantee I will not recommend this place! They need to either come down on prices or ramp up the portions!",1
"Worst Mexican food I ever had. The burrito is wet, and tasteless. The torta is tasteless also. Even the Pepsi taste weird. And the price is way too expensive for food served on disposable plates. Even Green Burrito inside of Carl's Jr. taste way better. If you see a line at this place, they are waiting for the Starbuck next door. Don't be confused by it.",1
"Phoenix Ranch Market is a chain supermarket that is a natural food store that sells organic products and offers a lot to the vegetarians and vegans in the area. This location is great, it has nice employees and ample parking. The salad bar and bakery are to die for. Phoenix Ranch Market also has a rather extensive selection of natural health and beauty products.",2
"people aren't kidding when they say this place looks ghetto from the outside! It IS in the ghetto, but once you walk in, the restaurant is pretty nice. They have a huge menu. We ordered the pad thai and tom kha ghai soup.both super good. and of course, thai tea I'll definitely be coming back here when I'm craving thai food!",2
"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat. The burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor. The Angus burger at McDonald's has better flavor than this one, and that's pretty bad.",1
"Fantastic quality and customer service. I have nothing but great things to say about Spa Lamar, and it's my ""go to "" place for massages. I fully recommend them for a quality and well valued massage. It's worth it. Great location just north of Fashion Square. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. They will explain everything, especially if it is your first massage.",2
"Alan totally helped me out a couple weeks ago when I was in a rush to get a family photo framed. I found him thanks to yelpers stating how awesome he was and they were 100 right. He was friendly, professional, does beautiful work and for a very reasonable price. I will never go anywhere else for my framing needs again. Thanks, Alan! ",2
"Hanny's is a pretty cool spot to grab a late night snack and cocktail. More of an intimate restaurant vibe than a drinking spot like I was originally expecting, but for a calm night it's a sure bet. Definitely check out the elevator shaft you can stand in, as well as the bathrooms that kind of make you feel more like you're at a carnival than a classy establishment. but I mean that in a good way.",2
"Your head needs to be in Eileen's hands. Vinny's is the best little barbershop I've ever been to. Always a great cut, nice atmosphere, and if you go on Saturdays, there's donuts. So, I pretty much only go on Saturdays. Oh, and for 13 bucks a cut, its also more affordable than any other place around!",2
"I didn't like their customer service. I called in to ask whether they had a TV for customers to watch if the customers decide to eat in. The lady heard the word ""TV "" and said I called the wrong number and hung up. nCalled back again, and as soon as she heard my voice, she hung up. Is this the kind of service you want? I won't be going back there.",1
Seems like the designers of this club just got plain greedy. I would think most people go clubbing to dance? But apparently not according to whoever did the layout for Hakkasan. 80 of the floor space is dedicated to tables. With 10 to bars and 10 to dance space. The dance floor on the hiphop area is an embarrassment. It is basically a large walkway.,1
"The location was great, right on the strip. The ambience was nice too. The food, though, was a little disappointing. We opted for the rodizio and they served things like turkey and pineapple. Not an authentic brazilian churrascaria. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't authentic and unique as I had expected. Also, It was a bit pricey, I guess because of the location.",1
"Went there during the lunch special. It took us half an hour to get seated. The next time I go I'll make sure to make a reservation. Otherwise, I loved the ambiance and the service was good. The white fish I had was very fresh but lacked flavour. However, the baklava ice cream was easily the best I've ever had everyone needs to try it out!",2
"Solid Dim Sum place. Nothing fancy, but good reliable Dim Sum. It can get very busy on the weekend so get there early. One caveat, they have a small side room with a couple of tables in it. Try not to get seated in there. It appears the cart goes there last so the food might be sold out or less fresh.",2
"2.5 stars nThis was another restaurant on the last trip to Vegas that really wasn't anything too special but priced as though it were. It certainly was ok chips were fresh and warm though the salsas weren't anything to get excited about. Fish tacos were good, but hardly memorable and their standard Margarita tasted all fakey fake.",1
"One of the worst cities my career has brought me to. The schools are trash, the drivers are trash LA driving isn't even thid bad. Everything is expensive, everything looks identical, houses,people, etc. Looking forward to my leaving, I'll never return. If I want to gamble, I'll go to next door Lake Charles, LA.",1
"How have I not written a review for Fallout Games?! This place is awesome! So many selections of games new and OLD! I'm talking they have Sega Genesis games! SCORE! The staff is friendly and very helpful. I love stopping in here just to see what they currently have in stock. Sometimes, you can find some pretty rare, sought after games. Love this store!",2
I stumbled into this place not long after hearing about them on a local radio show. To say the the service absolutely sucked would be far too kind. My meal was at best mediocre. I remember leaving and hearing the radio show host's words in my head. He talks about spending 18 years in the food service industry. I wondered as what.a dishwasher?,1
"My family was here on Monday for lunch and it was great. This place have a better taste and more selections then any other places around this area. Since we all were so hungry so everything tasted good. The two orders I didn't like was the soup Canh chua and the che. Overall, this place have good services, reasonable prices, and good location.",2
"Overpriced, tasteless food. expensive salads and then they nickel and dime you for extra toppings not just meat but also avocados, figs, etc. The red lentil soup was somehow spicy and flavorless all at the same time. The waitress who brought out our food slammed each plate loudly in front of us. Overall unimpressed and will not be back.",1
"We went with a couple of families. There was 13 of us and the bill came to 340 and it was family style. I got 3 small tacos, mac ' n cheese, a tiny quesadilla that the kids wouldn't touch. Go to Rubio's. Go somewhere else. This place is a huge rip off. I am still flabbergasted at the gall of this place to have the prices they have for the severing sizes that they provide.",1
"i went for brunch. it was delicious! nthe service was great, top notch! the only reason i gave it 4 was the price, AAAAND the burger. i make burgers just as good at home for cheaper. YIKES. i love the look of the place, the service, the bunch was delicious! and id eat the burger again. so yes Ill return! ",2
I have used a lot of plumbers in the Phoenix area for many decades this father son combo is the best I have run across. They arrive on time which is unheard of with other plumbers. Do exactly what they tell you they are going to do at a very reasonable price. Other Phoenix plumbers should train with these guys to see what running a family business and giving good customer service is all about!,2
"I couldn't be happier with my sister's choice in two amazing artists! Being from out of town it's so difficult to find people you can trust with your appearance I now have been transformed into a 20s starlet! Thank you ladies for taking so much time, for being so engaging and for all the suggestions that we never would have thought of!",2
"A great little spot. My friends took me here for my going away party. It is small and in a strip mall. The gentleman, who helped us, was friendly. The chips and salsa were delicious. I got the tamale sampler and it was really good. I loved all three but really enjoyed the cheese green chili one. The prices were very reasonable! I couldn't believe we were the only ones in there.",2
"OH. MY. GOD. So good. So delicious. So cute. So delicious. So good. So cute. So too far away for me to go to often, but it would be worth it. We had the jerk pork sandwich amazing , as well as the turkey and avocado wrap and the veggie wrap. Everything was spectacular and so fresh, not to mention filling my mother and I couldn't finish our sandwiches. Oh and the sweet potato chips. YUM. Try it!",2
So I thought I would add that a couple weeks after I posted this the manager messaged me asking for my email so he could send us a gift card to try it again and he never did I didn't leave the review because I wanted something for free I just didn't want people to expect to much. Guess some of the other reviews on the management are true.,1
"This is a wonderful little hole in the wall. Next door is a laundromat, so it smells soapy fresh when you step outside. My burritos came fast and they were really, very tasty. If you're driving by and you're wondering, ""Should I eat here? "" you should. For two burritos, I spent a little over 8 bucks. Not bad at all.",2
"I am very pleased with this Meineke shop. I brought my car in for an oil change and fluid level check etc.I was expecting the guys to push the need for other service on my car as happens at other places. The service people took care of what I needed, made future suggestions but all in all my car was running fantastic. I will come back to Meineke for my oil changes and other service needed.",2
"dead on.meh, i've experienced better.best part of the evening playing with the food. scared the daughter with crawfish, convinced the son to eat escargot, then attempted to get both kids to kiss a giant shrimp with eyes. the husband says three stars, but honestly i don't think i'd eat at this joint again.",1
"This place was fantastic, and even though it's in the lobby of a skyscraper it's really a great place to go grab a bite to eat. They offer both sweet and savory crepes, and you can completely customize them to your liking. The staff were friendly, and were really helpful for a first timer like myself.",2
"First place that I found in Gilbert that has Pho.Ordered takeout a couple times this month. The Pho is flavorful, with fresh ingredients. Spring rolls were also tasty and also made fresh. The owners were very accommodating and friendly. I haven't had the opportunity to try anything else yet, but would like to. Worth going back!",2
"I'm giving Chateau Nightclub 2 stars because I know that they have the potential to do much better. They play great music and there is an incredible view from the balcony, but I have to agree with other Yelpers that Chateau is poorly laid out and the lines and front door staff are unorganized. I've been to Chateau 4 times since they've opened and am hopeful that the 5th time will be the charm!",1
"I went to 2 other car repair shops one of them Whitey's in Scottsdale and literally spent 2,000 on repairs that did NOT fix the rattle. Advanced Auto found it right away. I feel like I am being treated like a valued customer, not a cog. I will never, every go back to Whitey's. They could have cared less, and I spent 2,000 on.likely repairs that were not eveeeded.",2
"The service is great here, however everything on the buffet is not great. The crab legs were small and they were sitting in water. Crab legs should be stemmed, not boiled in water. I do not like the old dirty carpet in the dining area. It made me lose my appetite. Besides that I probably will not go back unless I am famished.",1
"Patrick is great. Besides saving me loads of money on my home auto, he's gone above and beyond when I was selling and purchasing my homes one was in a flood plain, and trying to get my mortgage company to get the appropriate docs was a nightmare. Patrick handled it all, in record time, and it wasn't even his responsibility.",2
"I should have known that this place wasn't going to be very good the second I walked in. The place smelled a little off, the miso soup tasted like dishwater, the yellowtail was old and fishy, and the beef yakisoba was way overcooked. The only good part of the meal was the waitress was nice, but the food was not good at all.",1
This place has authentic Mexican cuisine. I came here with my sister who has been talking about the wonderful food here.We tried the vegetarian fajitas and Mexican stir fry. Both were delicious. Their tortila chips were served hot and the salsa was a little different but okay. The servers were courteous and the service was pretty quick. I will visit this place again!,2
"Im picky when it comes to my hair and who to trust. Also about how far I have to travel and the price to spend on a quality haircut. Im a guy who likes shears used and my hair to be managable and have volume, and Kristy is great. Took me months to find a good spot here in AZ. Very pleased with her spot! I recommend for ladies and men who are into hair with some style to it.",2
"This is my first poutine from a regular cafe. The first poutine I had was from Garde Manger read my other review! so I might be ruined. However, it was still pretty good poutine. I also got the fish burger. What was most impressive was the dynamic duo that runs the place. They are very busy, they work in a tight space, and are still extremely cheerful and friendly!",2
Sat down for late dinner with wife. Cool sports bar ambience in the Arizona center in DT PHX. Good selection of pizza and pasta. I settled for the margherita pizza. YuM.! Wife had pepperoni. Good choice of beer. Patrons come in for a quick slice and beer! n4 big screen TV' on the wall for sports fanatics. Patio seating avail.,2
We love this place. The food is always great. We usually order the 2 slice special and chef salads. The pizzas are always hot and the salads fresh when we get them. Patrick always make me laugh when I call in my order and it's always a good experience. I would have added pictures except everybody was already digging in before I had a chance.,2
"The staff is friendly, funny, and accommodating. Ive had make up, hair, spray tan, and bridal services at the salon. Ive been going here for about 7 years. I'm always satisfied with my hair cuts, color, and style. Gigi is the most amazing stylist. If you haven't been to see her and the salon, you are missing out.",2
"My friend and fellow yelper John M. has taken me here twice and I was very pleased both times, not just with the food but also with the casual setting and the friendly service. Being in the CityScape area, it has the advantage of being right smack downtown without being in a noisy, traffic plagued area. The outdoor seating area is really pleasant, especially during the evening hours.",2
"Still love it, even though they've now got enough flat screen tvs in the Fireside Lounge to have, like, a 1 1 ratio to customers when the place is packed. I still really enjoy that the waitress are in full length black evening type gowns at all hours. It make it feel special, even if it's only 4 in the afternoon. They need to dust the forest of trees in the main dinging area.",2
"This place is cute and cozy. Not a big restaurant but surely feels comfy. The food is surprisingly good. Especially the Takoyaki! Mmmm. I want some more Tried pork feet rice plate today and it was perfectly cooked, not too crunchy not too tender. I'm definitely coming back to try out some hot pot soon! Highly recommend.",2
"This place is wonderful. It'll stick in your mind and you'll want to come back. The decor, the food.ahhh. Admittedly, it's not the cheapest lunch if you're a student on a budget looking to grab a bite. But trust me, you're paying for a satisfying meal. I've tried their burgers, nachos, and some sort of polenta based dish, and enjoyed them all. Oooh, get dessert too. You won't regret it.",2
"This is my favorite place to be! other than with my family, of course nEveryone there is EXTREMELY nice, welcoming, supportive, and encouraging from the beginners to the advanced WODers. Mike and Jolene, the owners coaches, are VERY knowledgable, and know how to keep you safe while pushing you to do your best. I will NEVER go anywhere else!",2
"Great menu, quality and selection, but I just never see how anyone can charge 15 for a pound of any type of meat. It doesn't cost 15 for the whole damm corn beef. Their keiser rolls were just over 1 for EACH. Yes they were big but still that is pricey. I think this is a great place but just pricey is all.",2
"Loved the food, the location, the service, the food, the location, the service. and I could go on and on. This very health conscious eatery has me wanting to return. Great protein bowls, wonderful salads, and extraordinary baked goods. The smoothies are also amazing. Try it even if you're not into healthy food, it's very good.",2
"Patrick and his crew moved my stuff from my condo into a storage unit. They were punctual, very courteous and very efficient. I was very impressed from beginning to end. I felt like he was very honest and not trying to tack on unnecessary fees. When the time comes to move out of the storage unit into my new home, you better believe I'll be calling him again!",2
"Anthony is awesome! Super chill, down to earth waiter. I always tell him what's up whenever I'm at Teharu. Also, the food is way cheap for what you get. Cheapest sushi in Tempe Chandler! You can get a meal that fills you up and a sake bomb for like 15. Unreal. I don't get how some of these reviews criticize this place. It's awesome, never had a bad experience there.",2
"Love this store. Always quiet and clean! Employees are friendly and helpful always. They work fast. HUUUUUUUGE selection of discount DVDs for 1.00. If you cannot find something you like in the midst of all the discount movies, idk what to tell you! Most other movies are decently priced, generally 3.99 Definitely worth checking out",2
"Finally went to Postinos after many people telling me how good it is. I went in with high exceptions and i was let down. Our food was overpriced and honestly not that good. We ate on the patio and the misters were leaking on us, my friends pants where completely soaked, the service was ok but nothing special. There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better",1
The homemade tortillas are amazing! I'm glad I came here. They won best tacos in Las Vegas 2014 and didn't disappoint. I was blown away by how much the homemade tortillas made a difference combined with the perfectly cooked carne asada! Nice friendly staff and very clean on the inside. Make sure you stop by and enjoy!,2
"Bon c'est un quartier sp u00e9cifique chinois et c'est vrai que lorsque l'on passe la grande porte chinoise, on u00e0 l'impression de changer de pays et d'avoir besoin d'un passeport. nPour le reste plus rie'est u00e9crit en Fran u00e7ais ou Anglais, et cela dure uniquement sur quelques rue donc pas besoin de faire un d u00e9tour pour cela.",1
"Pretty damn good burger! Came years ago and did the build your own burger, I just remember the burger was cooked perfectly, thick juicy patty, along with the fried egg that oozed yolk all over. Great drink beer list too, left with the fullest happy belly ever! A little pricey for a burger but fresh ingredients and great flavor, well worth it.",2
It was great to walk into this location and not be ignored! The staff was great and available to assist me with what I was looking for and pointed me in the right direction. The staff wasn't on me constantly but let me shop and if I looked like I had a question they asked if I needed help. I will certainly be back to this location!,2
"I'm surprised the reviews for True Food aren't a little better. It's true that it's on the expensive side and there is a sales nature to the waiters, but if you want to eat some really amazing salads or a healthy lunch that won't leave you feeling weighed down, this is a great spot. Their salad with farm vegetables with manchego and the sashimi tuna salad are two of my favorites.",2
"Tried their ""Lee's Cafe "" which is Vietnamese style coffee w condensed milk ice. It was good, better than all the other things I've had here, but I could still get that some where else. Good thing about this place is that it's open on holidays and 24 hours. This still doesn't make the cut for ""go to places. """,1
"This place rocks! I ordered an arrabiata which was off menu and they made it no problem. Bread was delicious. Food even more so. Pricing was good. I think the arrabiata was about 11 ish. Which was inline with the rest of the 'non meat' type pastas. So yeah. If you want some good italian and Carla Brunei is not available lol , then go for Roma! You wont forget it!",2
"I can't say enough great things about stax. Their menu is fabulous with huge variety with tons of options to customize even GF. Their cocktails were a bit overwhelming, options I mean and tasted delicious. The atmosphere is swanky and hip, super chill. All in all love love experience try the ahi you'll be impressed.",2
"This place has a great atmosphere! The furniture and decorations are super contemporary. They're playing tasteful music, too. The yogurt flavors are delicious! They greet you right when you walk in and instantly offer you a small cup to sample any of the flavors. This is my new favorite frozen yogurt place. ",2
"My husband and I have gone here quite a few times. I really enjoy their pizza. I'm a super duper fan of thin crust and their is crunchy and thin and garlic y . I've had their pasta and it was really good as well. I think their garlic bread is amazing! It's an awesome little place, and family owned which makes it even better!",2
"I'll give it to Taste of Chicago, it looks the part. Chicago sports stuff check! And that's where the Chicago similarities end. As I must do for any place that claims ""Chicago "", I tried the Italian beef. Hmmmm. notsomuch. Pretty bland, overly chewy, too thickly sliced. Wait. Is this store bought? You really shouldn't have to wonder that.",1
"Had the breakfast into lunch buffet this past Saturday. From about 11am to 1pm. Ehhh, its ok. The desserts are the only good highlight. But everything else is so so. Decent selection of mostly standard lunch items. They have a coffee espresso machine. It made me an amazing mocha espresso drink and a separate cappuccino drink. Both amazing.",1
"Very cool american bar off the main campus of Carnegie Mellon. I ordered the special of the day, the crab cake sandwich, and I really enjoyed it. It came with huge steak fries that definitely met all my carb needs. It also came with a good little corn salsa that I topped on my sandwich. Nice staff and the food came out in good time. Happy all around.",2
"Had a wonderful dinner here last week. Service was great very friendly and helpful. Ambiance is amazing cozy lounges outside and in, beautiful decor and black and white films projected in the rooms. The food is also delicious, specifically the fried chicken which even made my vegetarian sister drool. Wooo eee! Can't wait to return for more!",2
"I I ordered charcoal cabin filters but when the parts arrived, 2 boxes looked like they went through the trenches. When I opened them, no more like they just fell out the boxes, they were NOT charcoal activated filters I wrote them and waited 2 weeks, did not hear from them. I won't be buying from them again!",1
"One of the few places in town that caters to a pescetarian or vegetarian diet, Long Life has some good stuff to serve up to us usually carniverous people as well. They serve up Chinese style food with a wide assortment of veggie 'meats.' My veggie friends love it here, and I don't mind tagging along with them at all.",2
"Very mediocre. This place is so close to my house, and I wish it had the potential to be a regular happy hour spot, but sadly it does not. I went roughly 6 months ago, so hopefully some things have changed. They had no beer on tap. really? Shocking. The food and decor were average. The prices were reasonable. Until they have beer on tap we will not return.",1
"I never review franchises unless the are bad. This taco bell is terrible. If I want taco bell I go further and more out of the way to get it. Service is terrible, they are always messing up an order and the drive through is always backed up. Several different people have worked here and they continue to be rude, and could care less about their work ethic. Avoid this place",1
"Our first experience at Texas Roadhouse was delightful. Emily, our server, provided perfect recommendations. Our meals 4 of us from start to finish was delicious. The manager even checked in on us, making sure we were satisfied with food and service. The meat on the ribs really does fall off the bone.no false advertising there!",2
"A nice room at a premium price, so it's what you would expect really. The quality of the food is what let this place down. I am pretty sure at breakfast I got 3 count them! mushrooms. The ceasar salad I ordered from room service was pretty slimy while the soup was very bland and again hardly any bread . The gym is also pretty antiquated, thoguh I suppose its good they've wedged one in.",1
"I had the worst customer service experience of my life at the Aveda store in Southpark Mall in Charlotte, NC. I will never shop with Aveda again, and I will tell everyone I know to avoid Aveda as well. I've had better customer service at Wal mart. Hopefully the problem is isolated to the Southpark store only and not other Aveda stores.",1
"Went to Prohibition for Sunday brunch. I ordered the eggs benedict. The taste was strange and i was finished in about 2 minutes flat. Now I'm already thinking about lunch because I'm still hungry. On a side note, the chairs were uncomfortable and the noise level unpleasant. I would avoid this place unless you're looking for strange food and poor service.",1
"I came to a wedding reception here and loved every bit of the Mandarin Bar. The views were amazing and staff was awesome. The bride and groom had their own drink for the night which was a pear martini and it was out of this world. Whether your coming here as a venue or just for some drinks, it's an amazing time.",2
"Average corporate airport hotel, operates on the hostage model. They are aware that most guests are trapped at the airport and over price the services accordingly. The restaurant is below average quality at very high prices, slow, plan at least an hour and a half for a lackluster dinner. Pretty sure this is where the TV show, The Walking Dead, recruits for extras.",1
"was there for the first time and my impression was very neutral. It is a cute place, was busy , but to the point it took way too long for the food, l think they had problems in the kitchen. The worst hashbrowns i had ever eaten. The pancakes were ok. They have a chance to be good, i hope they correct their problems and get good quality food.",1
"Went for lunch. Got the lunch special Almond Chicken. Portion was awesome and came with crab puff and wonton. Quality was subpar. Chicken was fatty and chewy I hate that . Chicken felt slimey too. Fried rice was usual. Egg drop was usual. Not going back. Nice people, clean, and not expensive at all though!",1
"delicious bagel lox and the place is cute in a tacky 70s diner sort of way. they're not trying to impress you with stupid decor although i don't judge, it's an added plus if your food service's good and a joke if it's the opposite . they want you to have good food! staff was friendly and patient with us. i kind of want to go back today for round 2.",2
"The place to go for anything from moonshine to ridiculously expensive anything. The wine tastings and beer classes are a great touch, but the growler station did me in. So great! I have never had to wait for service, which had almost always been with a smile sans a literally twice out of hundreds . I love this place.",2
"Cure was not what I expected as I assumed it would be a lot of meat, and not much else. Pleasantly, Cure does a great job at balancing out dishes to create delicious and interesting meals. The menu may not be for everyone, but Cure is definitely a place to take a chance and try something new as you can be sure they'll do it right.",2
"I heard funny noises and my car wasn't shifting right. it made me a bit leery, and I am from out of town. I called East Side, and they were very up front saying that they would be able to drive it around, check my fluid levels, and let me know what they thought. Everywhere else I had contacted was booked, and these guys came through! Very Helpful!",2
"Called requesting a packet of information in order to hire one their models for regular fashion shoots. They never sent it. The impression I was given is that I am a waste of time because I do not have billions of dollars. Guess what? My money spends just the same as any wealthy client you have. Way to screw the start up. Great job, guys.",1
"This place is NOT nearly as good as the other California Pizza Kitchens we've been to, such as the one in Monterey, CA. At this joint, one personal pizza and two beers cost 31, including the tip. A bit much, I'd say, even for an airport. The pizza was okay, it had 4 slices but the crust was soggy. There must be better alternatives at this airport.",1
"Do not go to this location! They charge you more compare to other location and give u repackage food! I order a southwest salad with grill chicken, got home ready to eat when I see that there are some other dressing on the salad and the veggie looked old, the grill chicken was cold. I was so disgusted and have to throw it out.",1
"I stopped in to get a bowl of soup on my walk home yesterday. I go the soup of the day, turkey chili, and it was definitely average. The flatbread that came with it was pretty bad. Everything was served in paper, even though I got it to eat there, which I thought was pretty weird. There are lots of great local restaurants on State St, and I don't know why I came in here. I won't be coming back.",1
"The food is good but the portion they give you is terrible. I counted 10 steaks in my entire burrito, I got more rice than anything and very little cheese. I can't even taste the cheese. The chips are stale and very salty! The salsa is pretty good. The service was okay. Seems like they all were trying to talk and it was confusing me. If their portion size was better I'd be more satisfied.",1
Just waited in line to be seated. We got our table. For 10 minutes we waited and watched waiter after waiter walk by. No one came to ask us what we would like to drink. No one came to take our order. I over exaggerated a few loud coughs as our waitress walked and she ignored us. We walked out and will not be back as our business is obviously not wanted.,1
"Wow! Wow! Beautiful views on top of a ridge overlooking the city. In order to get to the dining room you have to ride a exterior glass elevator climbing the building! Cannot get any better.! nBeautifully prepared fish, great wine selection, desserts, the views. Rank this place high on my scale of ten. nExcellent service, excellent food, you have to go here.",2
"I've had a lot better sushi than here at Oyshi. The rolls were a little sloppy and so was the information on the food we ordered. It didn't quite meet our expectations, but left me full. Service here is pretty sad. Best part of this place is the ambiance, but the music is killing it. Excited to get the check and leave. No plans on coming back to this location.",1
"I could go on and on, but let me just say this. Definitely NOT even close to Mexican food! Not worth a 75 dinner for two people. I have to say the guacamole was good, but you can't go wrong with fresh ingredients made right in front of you. Waiter was super busy and never around, nice guy but too sweaty!",1
"One of the good things about my job moving to the new office.we found this place. Their food is amazing! The shrimp honestly any pad thai is great there. I haven't been to the restaurant yet, but the delivery service is great. They are very friendly and apologetic if they run late. If you're looking for good spicy Thai give this place a try.",2
"Great new place in Cave Creek! CCOOC's website boasts that they have ""the highest quality oils and balsamics from all over the world. "" Well, I love both and have done many tastings so trust me when I say, they have a great selection of the best oils and balsamics I've tasted! Everything was so true to the label bold and flavorful. This will be my new go to place when I want quality o b!",2
I kinda expected the drunken mushroom chicken bowl to have broth in it because of the title? upon further review i realized my mistake. It was just better than okay for me the vegan chicken was yummy but the rest lacked the flavor i was craving. nthe meatball po boy was quite good as were the fries see my reviews of the other green location and nami for more about the menu ,2
"We had the restaurant.com recommendation and certificate. . .We had the gyro wrap, gyro dinner and euro platter. We enjoyed the dinner and the atmosphere very much. The waiter was attentive. Had an excellent evening. Would go again in a heartbeat. They are making me change my cuisine choice to greek. The cheesecake, NY and Baklava style was a perfect way to end the night.",2
So unimpressed. Restaurant was FREEZING inside our server was much more worried about the tables of young guys than she was with getting our order. We ordered burgers chicken strips. Chicken strips tasted like frozen Tyson strips. Burger was way over done. Never came to check on us just dropped off the check. Food was WAY overpriced for what it was. We will not be returning.,1
Our first family vacation was started out with Delta. We decided to splurge and get 1st class to LAX. Their 1st class was more like 5th class. The plane was so small and the flight attendant was under heavy stress and yelling at the oncoming traffic. Terrible to be working in a cramped cabin with strangers. Yikes! nNever again!,1
"Best breakfast place in the area, hands down. Nothing fancy, but they do standard breakfast stuff properly and as expected. There's a bit of a line Saturday and Sunday morning, but it moves quickly. They also do a decent lunch, I recommend the Georgia Salad. UPDATE I'm less fond of this place they screwed up my eggs benny the last couple times to the point of uneatable. I don't go here anymore.",1
Unfortunately I'm not a stranger to dental work and I've had an unfair number of procedures over the years. To say that Dr. Castano was fabulous is somewhat of an understatement. Root canals are never a fun experience however mine was the most boring one I've ever encountered. Kudos to the entire team Surprise Endodontics. I highly recommend this office.,2
"Upgraded to a 4 star after going back a second time something I'm trying to do unless I have an absolutely horrible time . Great atmosphere, great to people watch. The staff is friendly and attentive. The food was good to very good, but the drinks were to die for. Excellent selection. Nice spot to begin or end a date. Central location in Old Town. Definitely a fun time.",2
"I come to Rubio's for one thing, the herb garlic shrimp tacos with bacon. I was craving these and I was on this end of town so I stopped by. This Rubio's has great seating inside and out and super friendly service. They were also sampling food options as you waited for your food. How awesome is that?!",2
I don't know why I continue to punish myself by coming here. They have been consistently slow here for at least 8 months. Save yourself time and head to the grocery store and buy the ingredients for whatever you planned on ordering and go home and cook it. It will be faster and probably not be incorrect.,1
The rooms are very comtemporary. The bathrooms have a tub and shower. The tub has jets so it could be a jacuzzi. But who needs that with the 4 different pools they have and they are gorgeous. Be sure to get down there early as all the good seats in the sun get swiped quickly. The housekeepers are really nice and honest. Valet has 3 separate spots plus the valet in the forum.,2
"what can i say other than i LOVE four kegs! after seeing them on diners, drive ins, and dives we had to check it out for ourselves. my boyfriend and i always split a boli stromboli , an order of hot wings, and a few coors lights to top it off! the pizza is delicious but then again everything on the menu ive had has been DELICIOUS! MMM mmm MMM! i love this place!",2
"Awesome work on the tortillas but. Everything was so salty it almost burned. The worst thing was the verde sauce or what is called their medium. It was unnaturally sweet? I'm like what? By unnaturally sweet, I mean it was like their is sugar added to the sauce. Weird and not good. Guac good. Pico good. Everything else I tried was, well just OK.",1
"Over hyped and priced, the main floor played EDM which I love, however the play list lacked energy and did not drive the party. Entrance and drinks are over priced, even for Vegas. The bouncers antagonize the guests, probably due to the steroid induced testosterone high. Bottom line, go to another club.",1
"Finally tried this place after living in Indian Trail for just over a year and a half. Stopped in with some out of town company. We had the pulled pork lunch special and banana pudding. Very delicious and I loved the variety of sauces. Casual atmosphere, uptight people stay clear if you want privacy.",2
"YES. The Sleepy Poet Antique Mall is nothing short of amazing. SO MUCH to see, so many unique vendors! Vintage clothing and jewelry, shabby chic furniture, books, old records, etc. Whatever you're looking for, you will probably find at Sleepy Poet. Make sure to give yourself a few hours when you visit this place, wear comfortable shoes, and visit on a weekday to avoid crowds.",2
"Food is pretty expensive, huge variety though always check the expiration dates they tend to have so much stuff that a lot doesn't get bought before they expire from my observation. Also just bought a box of cookies which were packaged separately inside the seal on both packages was broken they tasted good but just wanted to make people aware Les Galettes Caramel de La Mere Poulard .",2
Khoury's Fine Wine Spirits is a very recommendable place to buy of course wine. I love their selection and the staff was very knowledgeable of their products. I love that there is a small bar and you can drink wine and beer while enjoying the company of your friends. Its a nice hangout spot if you're look for cheap thrills.,2
"Used to love this place I just got back from Chateau and I'm disappointed to say that it was pretty crappy. The DJ was playing awful music and the crowd just seemed dead. I can usually dance to anything and have fun but the mixing and the music was just awful. Oh well, guess this club is going under soon. All clubs do eventually, right? ",1
"Stayed there 1 29 2 1 2009. It was better than I expected. Perfect mid strip location, friendly staff. I like the smallish gaming floor. The rooms were perfectly fine. I really have nothing bad to say about it, except I know there are hotels nearby that are even more amazing, like the Wynn or Bellagio.",2
"I went in to get a small hole in the center of the tread repaired on a new tire. The guy said he couldn't repair it and promptly went in to try to sell me a new tire for 220. Walked out and went down the road and an ""honest "" tire store fixed it for 20. They could have earned a new customer but now I'll turn everyone away from this place I can.",1
"Excellent restaurant. nPour la qualit u00e9 des produits et l'ex u00e9cution, mais aussi parce que les menus suivent les l u00e9gumes de saison, et surtout se fournissent parmi les producteurs locaux et respectueux des animaux. Je recommande le saumon fum u00e9 sur place, je n'ai pas encore eu la chance de gouter les p u00e2tes. Pour les vins, demandez u00e0 John, la carte est bien fournie.",2
"My mother always says ""If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all "". I am taking this to heart, as I really have nothing good to say about Alize. The manager refused to sit us lovely ladies at a table and shoved us to the bar. He said it would cost too much to set a table just for dessert. Ok, that is it I have said too much. Point is do not waste time on this place!",1
Very disappointed in this restaurant. . Service was ridiculously slow. They forgot our bread. The food took forever and when we finally got our risotto that was asparagus and chicken it was just asparagus. The server was nice enough to take it off the bill but that's not the point. For it being a pricy restaurant they sure weren't on their game. The food was meh. So We won't be going back.,1
"What the hell. I gave the guy 20 and the gas would only fill up to 19.89. It's not about the 11 cents, but the principle of the matter. From my experience, most gas pumps stop before it gets to the full value, but you can always keep pumping until it gets there. This was not the case with this one. The trigger was loose and just wouldn't go anymore. That's kinda fucked up if you ask me.",1
"Valle Luna has always been amazing but tonight we came here for a quick bite after unpacking and my hubby had what we would probably say is the best thing on the menu! He ordered the Sonoran enchilada dinner with red pork and let me tell you it was ABSOLUTELY fantastic! We should have taken a picture of it before he devoured it, but it's a little too late! We definitely recommend it!",2
"Un peu d u00e9 u00e7u. Je m'attendais u00e0 quelque chose parfait apr u00e8s avoir lu toutes les critiques, mais finalement je me suis retrouv u00e9 dans un endroit uniquement touristique. Dommage parce que le cadre est vraiment top avec ce pub import u00e9 d'Irlande, mais bon, apparemment le personnel ne suit pas, dommage.",1
First time staying at the Wynn. Our Deluxe Room had a lovely panoramic view. In the bathroom we found The used robes and hair all over the floor. The carpet had debris on it. We requested another room which was slightly cleaner. Still had carpet debris and a dirty streaked smudged mirror. We won't be back. I'm rating 2 star because the view from the 51st floor was breathtaking.,1
"By far the best sushi in Madison. For a Midwest place, this place has it all. In the 1 year I lived in Madtown, I was at this sushi joint more than any other restaurant. I always asked my server what was fresh that day, and it never disappointed my appetite for delicious raw fishies. I love this place and miss it terribly.",2
This place is great. I loveeeee frozen yogurt. It's really cheap too. Since I like it plain I just full my cup and don't really like toppings so I skip those. It's just like 3 dollars. I'm obsessed with the original plain flavor. It's SO good. The other flavors are okay. I've like some but none come close to the original flavor. I'm sticking to that one.,2
"First trip to Montreal, first time tasting poutine, smoked meat, beaver tail pastry queues de castor , and sugar pie. nMy sister I split a bacon poutine and really loved it, though it nearly put us in a salt coma. We were also tempted by the one with guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes. nIt's a crowded, fun place with many visitors snapping photos of their poutines.",2
They had a guy on the corner advertising breakfast I love this place for lunch but was really disappointed when I walked in with only one person working and 4 people I. Line and several people waiting for food needless to say I turned around and left. If your trying to build business you should be staffed to do so,1
"I was visiting Charlotte this past week and asked the hotel to recommend a locally owned place for breakfast. Parkway House was where I was sent. It was about 10am in the middle of the week. The seating was open. Service was prompt and friendly. The food was good, filling and cheap. I would definitely go back.",2
"We stayed here for a dance event, and loved it! Our room was decadent a jacuzzi halfway up the stairs the grounds were great, and the staff were friendly and helpful. It's right across from the Hard Rock Cafe and a great Indian place, and the convention center area is deceptively large if you want to throw an event.",2
Always a treat to see this if you make it on time or happen to be in the area a bit before the show starts! I notice you have to be careful as your in a zone watching the show from pickpockets. Easy to just lose yourself for 5 minutes! Very nice water show and a must for a first timer in vegas on things to do!,2
"I've done breakfast a few times and dinner once and I do enjoy it here. Food is always a new and fresh experience, and it manages to always surprise the taste buds in a very good way. Atmosphere is awesome, service is great and I love the originality. It's places like Maison Publique that makes Montreal different and unique. I'd best sum it up as commercial free!",2
"WOW! I normally stay at the Bellagio, but wanted to try the Wynn for something different. The Wynn has won me over. Everything is so up to date and clean. The staff was friendly and ready to serve. You would never have to leave the resort if you did not want too. The Wynn is the only place I will stay when I come to Vegas again.",2
"My favorite place to get boba in Vegas. They stay open fairly late, we have ridden our bikes here a few times. I like boba tea, but I prefer the yogurt drinks. They have a few different flavored yogurt drinks with the boba in it. I get the apple cinnamon ice yogurt or something like that. It always fills me up.",2
"Great happy hour and reverse happy hour! The portion sizes are great and the signature dishes are fantastic! The Lotus Roll not on fire is to die for. Even the kids meals are large and very well priced. Nice open atmosphere and great service. Pricing is comparable to other sushi places, but cuts are above average!",2
"Bought 4 cupcakes today and just wasn't impressed. We shared them among family tonight and the vote was pretty unanimous. Super sugary sweet frosting and dry fairly flavorless cake. The chocolate chip cookie dough was okay flavor wise. But overall, very disappointed in overpriced not so great cupcakes.",1
My hubby and I ordered at 12 04am exactly for delivery. We were told 40 minutes. We called at 1 15am and we're told the driver is on his way. At this point we were trying to stay awake. At 2am we call again to find out it's too late and the driver has gone home. Ummm you said he was on his way? You could have called to tell us that? nNever got to try the food and won't.,1
"Two small rooms that hold the poker tables. Often filled towards midday and past with little mini tournaments, the atmosphere here is fun, albeit it can be filled with locals at times, and so going into one of those games can leave you a bit high and dry. They do have high hand bonuses, which is nice.",1
"So it's been a year since the last time I was here. I went because the kids really wanted to try it again. I guess they had better memories of this place than I did. Well, we went here and what can I say? It's still the same as before. 1 Star. I am all for a cheap meal, but I don't think I could do this place again. I wish it was different, it used to be awesome but not so much anymore.",1
"LOVE Grouchy John's. I wish it was closer to home! Their OG is my go to drink. I had never been inside until recently, always drove through the drive through. GO INSIDE! Their shop is really cute, and you can see all the food they offer. The staff is also very friendly. I started following them on FB and it is pretty cool how involved the whole store is with the community.",2
"Healthy Authentic Thai Food at a great price! The new vegetarian menu is a big plus. It's my new favorite restaurant! Every time I go there, the owner introduces me to one of her new dishes, so I don't just order sweet sour every time. For groups that buy four entrees, they get the 5th entree free or a free appetizer.",2
"UPDATE a couple of days after this we received a very sincere and personalized sympathy card. This was a card that the staff wrote a personalized message to us, not a generic card that with just their signatures. PRAH is really top notch! Thanks again for the terrific service and compassionate treatment during a difficult time.",2
Everything on this menu is amazing except the kale artichoke dip. The bruschetta is to die for. The beet salad is my favorite thing I've had in months. My fianc u00e9 loves their burger and sandwiches. I have been many times and everyone I've gone with has loved their meals! Absolutely no complaints!,2
Awful awful terrible food! How can Pad Thai taste so bad?! This is Thailand's main dish! They should be ashamed and embarrassed! Did take out never been to location and will never go back! I give 0 stars not even 1! Me calling as a new customer they should have been more aware and tried to cook a good meal. Such a disappointment!,1
I cannot say enough about how amazing this restaurant is. The sommelier was super friendly even though I ordered a low middle range shiraz instead of the wine he recommended. Everything that came to our table was incredible. All of the food was soooo good. Service is impeccable. Andre himself came out to say hello. Might be my second favorite restaurant in Vegas L'Atelier being first! .,2
"I love Peppi's! I always get The Amazing Siegfried. It is a chicken club type of sandwich with bacon, mushrooms, provolone and american cheese. It is delish! I would give five stars but, their delivery guys is always slow and by the time the food gets to me it's semi warm. They have really good fries too!",2
"Great tasting Mexican food on the cheap! Better tasting than many of the sit down Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. It's a small little place with a dine in or drive through option. Many delicious items to choose from.my favorites are the steak and cheese quesadilla, cheese enchiladas, frijoles, and their awesome salsa!",2
"What I like in this place is that they these kind staff that will give efforts on repairing your shoes. Its my first time here but I never got the hard time dealing with them. They where approachable to the point that they you will always feel comfortable. The charges where affordable, I would recommend them to my friends.",2
We always sit on the patio when we go here because they are pet friendly and one of our dogs always comes with us. They have fantastic customer service. Their ice tea is the best I have tasted in town. We love getting pizza by the slice or grabbing a zucchini appetizer. Their salads are fantastic to. We go here often!,2
"Boo, this place sucks. My boss who loved Taco Ole also loved it here. She ws a nice lady, but I think her taste buds were built from poop sandwiches. There's not much to elaborate on other than to say that nothing I've ever had from here has been good. Some of it was close to not edible. And it's sad because REAL Memphic style BBQ is amazing. This is a really poor approximation thereof.",1
"These ladies are great. They pierced me, I came back with an emergency after getting help at another studio with my nose piercing wrong gauge OUCH . They gave me a dainty one and lots of good tips on healing. They proceed to pierce with care gentleness which is something a lot of places lack. Answered all my questions and glad to help if you come back.",2
Customer Service Non Existent! I walked into the shop and did not get a single greeting from the three associates. I looked around at the extensions and clip ins for 10 minutes and was not offered any help at all. Save your time and go to a different store for your extensioeed. Headed over to Mid K.,1
Trash. Never go here. Cook never washed hands in bathroom. Waitress cursed at us. Took over 40 mins to get our food. They should be closed down. I'm calling the health department. This was for the Dukes on Ray and Rural Rd. I won't bring my family back there again after the server cursed at us and the food was bad.,1
I saw Smashing Pumpkins here the other night and I was very impressed by the venue. It was my first time at the place and I was not aware how many great acts go through. The sound was crystal clear and loud enough to rock but not loud enough to hurt my ears. 12 Turbosound tops on each side of the stage make for quite the array. I will definitely be back.,2
"A little pricey, but it's at Caesar's so, but we had so much fun! I took my Mother, 3 kids, a gf for a birthday celebration.we took lots of great pics, since it's right on the Strip. Food was wonderful, drinks were fine, but the frozen hot chocolate was to die for! We will definitely go back that's from a Native local!",2
This place is dingy and run down. The service was barely passable. I did not enjoy either the Pho or the Pork plate. The spring rolls were pretty good and made ever better by the peanut sauce they came with. By far the best thing we were served were the crab puffs and I don't eat fish. Those I would go back for. To be fair my dining companion enjoyed all of food but agreed on service and decor.,1
"I took my car here for a complete detail before I sold it. The did a very thorough job, excellent service. The next day I noticed that the roof rack on my car had accumulated a bunch or dirt and other stuff. I removed the roof rack and took the car back the next day and they spent another 45 minutes recleaning everything. No questions asked! Very impressed!",2
"Disappointing food, small portions, overpriced, could have better service. Been here twice. Was bad on the first try lunch and was bad on the second try dinner . Had the poutine, burger, caesar salad and foie gras for lunch. Meh. Had the rillets, devils on horseback, scallops and pork belly with clams. Meh again. Will not be back. There are way better restaurants at this price point on the strip.",1
This place is absolutely awesome! I have never been to such a classy sports bar. The food is delicious and the service is so friendly and helpful! I got the Seattle salmon and I would definitely recommend that dish to anyone! Even though it is a little more pricey I would definitely go back it! It was well worth it.,2
"We had a party of 3 adults and one child 9 yrs . We enjoyed everything. The service was satisfactory, the food was good and portions were good for the price paid. We all took some home for another day. The salsa was very good as was the guacamole. I had the steak Cortez and was completely happy. I would be happy to return for another meal.",2
"Always pop in here for some lunch, the foods good, not large portions and a good selection of drinks, the staff are on the ball and even when the place is buzzing the service was spot on. but one criticism pet hate. I hate the Idea of take your table number to the bar and pay for your order upfront, sure for drinks or if your outside Brewers Fare comes to mind nIt wont stop me from going back tho.",2
I have to say sushi brokers is absolutely incredible. The sushi chefs definitely know what they are doing! My favorite has got to be the Hawaiian roll. Its to die for and not to mention the wonderful concoction of drinks! Music is always fun and the servers seems to be having an absolute blast working there. I will be back this is my new regular!,2
"Our group came here to eat at the Buffet and it did not disappoint. We waited about an hour and a half, but by the time we got seated we paid for brunch, but they started to bring out dinner items. Wide selection, nice ambiance and a decent price for a Las Vegas Buffet. Service was good and food was fresh. Don't miss the dessert section.",2
This place is ridiculously overpriced! Their food is not good quality. When you walk in it looks like a cafeteria and that's essentially what you are getting in terms of quality. 10.27 for a turkey sandwich that was almost all fat and had a required side I didn't want. This place is best avoided. It's not worth the calories or time.,1
"It may not be all I hoped, but having worked in downtown for 12 years, I am so happy for the CVS, Arrogant Butcher and Par Exsalonce in close proximity to my office that I am willing to have patience and give it time. I am hopeful, and I think okay, hope the one star reviews are a little unfair at this point. There are some businesses worth checking out!",2
"This was one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at. This establishment claims to be ""smoke free "", but the room we got smelt like cigarettes. There was a bunch of stains on the carpet hopefully, tooth paste . My feet were covered in dirt and filth from the carpet. The prices are cheap, but I doubt I'll be back.",1
"Really liked this restaurant, would definitely go again. We asked our server if there was some sort of tasting menu available since everything looked so good. For 80 per person we ate REALLY well. My faves Ahi in sweet ginger sauce it wasn't on their menu yet, but it was delicious! , Yellowtail with crispy jalepeno and kobe beef sliders.",2
"We have been there probably half a dozen times and had good food and speedy service. This past Mother's Day, despite having a reservation, we waited 1hour and 45 minutes to get our food. There was no explanation, no apology, and no attempt to make it right. We will not be back anytime soon, and for sure not on any holiday when they won't be properly staffed.",1
"Another groupon try. I got the dozen and shared it with my coworkers, we all agreed that the flavors all sounded awesome, but the frosting was SO overpowering. OKAY cupcakes, but nothing special. Another disappointment was that the flavors change by the day, so although I got a dozen of all different cupcakes I couldn't find a day that offered all of the flavors I WANTED to try.",1
Unimpressed. This is the second time I've gotten an arrangement here and both times I've been disappointed. I only went back because I thought I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves but was let down once again. My latest arrangement had small dying roses on it as well as a large gap in the center and overall just a crummy look. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.,1
"Giving a two since the ATM fees were not that bad especially for LV. However, this is the 1st time ever that I've been charged w an ATM fee by a supposedly Credit Union. One of the biggest reasons I bank exclusively w Credit Unions is so that I don't get hit w these frivolous charges. Oh well, another learning experience.",1
"Wild Purveyors are provisioners of locally sourced and foraged fruits, vegetables, meats and cheeses, specialty foods and all manners of interesting edibles. Brothers Tom and Cavan Patterson, and step brother Clark are genuinely nice guys with a passion for all things local. Give them a call, or go visit their retail store in Lawrenceville 53rd Butler Street ",2
"The Bartender was very rude to me, It's a very ""Old Boys "" place, please think twice before supporting a place like this, really the bartender call me ""Kid "", I'm almost 50 years old, and made a hand gesture for me to leave, I guess I just didn't fit, but I just want back to the Taproom at my Hotel, the Omni William Penn, a classy place that knows how to treat Customer's.",1
"Located at the Musical Instrument Museum nGreat food beverage selectioThe staff is super friendly nThe food is healthy, locally produced, and delicious nLoved the watermelon gazpacho nChicken burger was very tasty sweet potato friends nServe beer nThe prices are a little high, especially for the beverages",2
Usher was here when I came to the hottest club in Vegas. BFD! He just stood on stage with a glass of wine and didn't say one word. He just had a spotlight following his every move. sucka! We bought 3 bottles and still waited outside for an hour. WTF? The main line was moving faster. This place definitely hates fat people.,1
"The food was good but overpriced and overshadowed by the ridiculous in your face music and television show. Even the girls in scandalous outfits and guys hanging out at the bar just looked uncomfortable here, like they weren't sure what they were supposed to DO. The design concept is totally off the mark, and I doubt this place will be open much longer.",1
Worst meal I had while in Vegas. I ordered the pasta meatballs. The waiter told me it was a LITTLE spicy. He was way off. Even the pasta was spicy. My lips were numb after a couple of bites. I ordered coffee. When I asked for a refill I was informed that there were no free refills I would need to pay an additional 4.00 for another cup of coffee. Would not recommend this eatery.,1
"Raw Oysters on the half shell and the workers shelling it were able to tell me what type and kind they were. Tons of seafood lots of fresh food and LAMB! Hehehe. The best buffet ever in Vegas. Plus their macarons were to DIE for! They melted in your mouth with a subtle flavor then flooded you with a strong savory flavor that made me go ""Wow ""! It's about 50 bucks a person but SOOOO worth it.",2
Bad Service. Bad Food. My boyfriend ordered a kolashampan and they were flat. Ugly interior with a sign that says Welcome To Gringo's. I ordered the plantains with cream and beans. These were the most watered down beans I ever had. Horrible. My boyfriend's egg had runny oil. Ugh. I wish I had a warning.,1
"I used to love Ruth's, 10 haircut! And out the door in less than 30 minutes! nI am a simple gal with simple needs. A 10 haircut is perfect. nBut they have raised the price to a shocking 18, almost double and then an added tip? Eek. nI still got a 10 haircut that took less than 30 minutes, but it cost me 25. nI'll be going to the salon schools now. I would prefer Ruth's 10 haircut.",1
"I got asked for money 3 times by homeless people between the curb and the door. Once inside, the music was so loud, the staff was actually yelling to be heard and take an order. A bacon cheeseburger and drink no fries was 10.70, and was really bland. I don't understand how anyone likes this place or it stays in business.",1
"Hands down the best prime rib available, if the old saying is true you get what you pay for than this is quality at its finest, pricing is fair, about a hundred dollars for two with drinks, and they even bring the carving station to your table while the chef cuts the meat to your liking, all out great service.",2
"I pass by 5 dd on my way to work. I cannot stand this location. They are beyond rude. I pull up to the window and she doesnt say a word. I hand her my card, she swipes it and gives it back. Still no words uttered. She hands me my hot latte, with no sleeve, i say ""thank you "" she looks back at me and walks away. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? worst customer service!",1
"Very good Vietnamese food. The setting is not much to look at, but I always love finding a good ""hole in the wall "" restaurant. The food is delicious, and the service is good. Also, the prices are very reasonable. I have tried several dishes, but my favorite is a basic dish grilled pork with rice vermicelli. Also, the spring rolls are excellent. Very good restaurant, and highly recommended.",2
"Took my Mazda 3 in with a battery dying as I arrived. Got me right in, replaced and also found that I had a blown fuse for phone charger. Replace that as a courtesy! As luck would have it, our other vehicles car battery is going, so today I called and set an appointment. We will be visiting them this morning.",2
"I went here for lunch today, for the last time. I ordered the fried country steak. I received a piece of yesterday's roast beef, that was breaded fried and soaked in canned gravy. If you want a so so lunch, don't go here, if you want a good lunch, really don't go here. I have tried this place 5 or 6 times over the past 4 years thinking it will get better, it doesn't.",1
"I used to be a pizza, taco, and burger kind of guy. Now I'm a gyro guy. I've had gyros before, but wow! These gyros are freakin' delicious! I plan to take my wife there, and she better like it, or else I'm finding a wife who will. Seriously folks, this is great food. I can't wait to try some of their other dishes.",2
"Came in for lunch on Monday and stood at the door for a few minutes then we just decided to seat out selves. When the waitress came we ordered right away cause we always order the same thing, 1 dozen wings, the waitress had 4 tables and our drinks were empty the whole time until I waved at her and asked for a refill. The wings took 32 minutes! For lunch!",1
"Went with a friend and my sister for early dinner, reasonable prices for happy hour on apps and drinks! nFood was mediocre nothing special and can't really compete with more authentic mexican joints in the area. nWas a mexican restaurant posing as a sports bar is how I'd describe it. nBasically just went because we had a groupon NOW deal, wont be back again.",1
"Great place to get married, I was married last month here, The staff is abolutely outstanding and I highly reccomend it to avoid the stress of finding vendors. Regale! has professionals picked out that you can choose from. Everybody loved our wedding based on the feedback I got from attendees. Very well priced, beats some of the inner phoenix venues in price and definitely more genuine here.",2
"I must confess that I am a sucker for sweets so it may come as no surprise that I totally loved everything Chocolate and Spice had to offer us! We placed a large order only a few days after Thanksgiving to show appreciation to our Residents. Everything was delicious! I especially enjoyed the banana cream pie, pumpkin pie and tiramisu. Will definitely be back for more! YUM",2
"I wanted to like it, i really did. i even waiting 45 minutes in the cold hoping for a great experience. What we have here is a typical Scottsdale joint, trendy and hip ster . The eggs benedict was ok, but eclipsed by even Village Inn's version, they did have decent coffee though, and once seated in our cramped booth, the service was great.",1
"Very good and unique. nYou should try this place, I've never had anything quite like it. It is not so unique or foreign that you should be scared, it is a sandwich after all. nIt is a little expensive for what you get, but yummy. If you like Roast Beef and Horseradish. there is a killer sandwich here for you! D",2
"Moving to Las Vegas from San Diego, CA was a bit stressful and I wasn't sure I'd find a nail salon to do my ""pink and white "" nails. I was pleasantly surprised when I read that La Femme did this well. I made an appointment and Devon I believe that was his name did my nails. They are absolutely beautiful and he did a superb job! I will definitely be back!",2
"Glenha's is your typical British cafe! Well, it's a bit more exciting decor wise, but it serves everything you would expect to get in one. Fry ups, Bacon Rolls, Sausage rolls, tea, coffee, you name it. For that Glenha's, I am eternally greatful! I walk up here every other day to get to wherever I'm going, and the smell almost always tempts me in. It's easy, it's reliable and it's quick.",2
Everything is delicious! The chopped salad has so much flavor you will find yourself craving it. We went to eat here twice in a three night stay in Scottsdale. The drinks are wonderful. My husband tried a variety of them and enjoyed each one. I loved the wine offerings. The grits are outstanding and so are the creamy parsnips. We will definitely be back on our next visit to Scottsdale.,2
"In my continual quest for a great hamburger, I discovered this place via Yelp. I have visited 16 out of 20 of GQ's top Hamburgers and I have to say that this place is better than several of them. I would definitely put it on my list of top 20 hamburgers in America. I sat at the bar and I would recommend that if there are seats at the bar, grab them. It is better than standing in line.",2
Great park for shooting on any day of the week. They have shotgun and hand gun ranges both so it caters to any desire. Located on the outskirts of town it's a bit of a drive but very well worth it! Love the sporting clay range as well as the five stand challenge at the shotgun range. A truly hidden gem in Vegas!,2
"This park is sooooo awesome! There are miles of trails for biking jogging walking. I'm super pumped to explore them by bike this year, as we have mostly just hiked on them so far. There are also fields scattered throughout the park, and picnic tables too. There are off leash doggie areas too. i feel so lucky to have access to such a beautiful park in my neighborhood!",2
Very much disappointed for a five star hotel to serve such a crappy food and for the price they charge. Nothing special woth regards to the quality of the food and the variety of the food. Will never recommend this place and will never go back. The only plus side is our waiter was a totally nice guy and the dessert is also fine.,1
"Came here for a work lunch with colleagues during restaurant week in Madison. They had a nice three course lunch selection where you could mix match your own appetizer, main dish, and desert. All were quite good, we were very pleased. Service was, as typical, very good. This is one of my favorite places to eat in Madison.",2
"We wanted to try this place, ever since we saw it on Man VS Food. Finally had our chance and we were disappointed. We ordered the BIG UNIT, a 22 inch hotdog. What could be wrong? Its was made with VIENNA BEEF, you know the six little wieners in a mini can. It was BAD, I was expecting Nathan's! As far as the toppings A , the Baguette roll A . Would I come back, Yes, But to try something else.",1
"This is the best Einsteins I've been to! It's clean, the staff are friendly, and it has a GREAT outdoor seating area. Paul, the owner, is friendly and goes out of his way to make sure we're happy. He remembers us when we come in it's a big company run with a small, family business feel. I've made this my breakfast spot because I know that I'll be treated well!",2
"If you come here, try and find chef John and let him do his magic. He's a master of his trade and takes sushi to the next level. Fresh fish at its finest. Sushi was tender and buttery, and king crab legs were sweet and tasty. The huckleberry creme br u00fbl u00e9e was off the hook. Only criticism is that the lobster roll had too much mayo.",2
I went to Sugar N Spice with a running group that frequents the restaurant. They knew most of my group by name as well as their usual orders. They were helpful and accommodating and had amazing breakfast sandwiches. I bragged about Sugar N Spice on Facebook later that day and I friend of mine visited the next day. He was equally as pleased. I'll be back again and again!,2
"Oh how I do love Crescent! This place is the best and most appealing music venue that I've been to in AZ so far.but the good news doesn't stop there the food is amazing as well! I've had burritos, quesadillas, and burrito bowls, all of which have been amazing. The bean dip, however, is what I'd boast about all day. That and the honey badger of course .",2
Yummy! I needed a cake last minute for my mother jn law's birthday and stopped in to this wonderful place for the first time! I picked up a pink champagne cake and some sugar cookies! The cake was WONDERFUL! It was a big hit with everyone! The cakes were really good. Not typical frosted sugar cookies SO much better! I would highly recommend to anyone!,2
"I work downtown, and this place is too far to walk, but the parking is so difficult, so they deliver for a small charge, and their food is really good, and I know good Middle Eastern food, and theirs is right up there. The food is reasonable as well, whether you work downtown, live in Vegas or just visiting, this is the place for great Middle Eastern food.thank you Kabob Korner.",2
"I gotta say. nI've been in here a few times and each time I had a great time! Really great time! Singing along at the top of my lungs to Billy Joel songs great time! HOWEVER nI've always stopped here after bar hopping a bit. This was kinda the last stop. and we were all pretty buzzed each time we visited this place. I dunno. I have fond, fond memories of this place though.",2
"Worst customer service I have ever experienced. The manager is a complete ass and extremely difficult to work with when the store itself makes a mistake. The items at the store are good and decently priced, but save yourself the headache and go to a different mega furniture location. I wish that manager would just get fired.",1
"Total Wine, where do you go wrong, NO WHERE. I look forward to starting my Saturday or Sunday with a quick sip will shopping for booze. Oh wait, it's called a tasting. Great selection and good prices for that selection keeps me coming back for more. I especially love looking at the wine I can't afford behind the glass. I can dream.",2
"This place gets a giant ""MEH "" from me. I live in the area so I've been to this bar a number of times and I always have the same experience. The food is consistently sub par, the portions are extremely small given the price and the beer is extremely over priced when compared to other bars in the area.",1
"I was so underwhelmed when I was here. Service was good food came fast. I don't quite like the iPad on the table but ehhh. Truffle fries were quite blah and didn't eat but a few. The burger was also very ehhh, I had about three bites and ate the rest when I was drunk. In my opinion there are much better places to eat while in Vegas.",1
"This is my second time here this week! Everyone is super nice and the good is delicious. I have had a meatball pide and the no pasta lasagna. Both excellent. The food is cooked to order and whe you receive it, it is nice and hot. The portion sizes are very generous and good for sharing multiple dishes.",2
"Stay away! They will scratch up your car. Visited this place for the first and last time and noticed tons of fine scratches on lower rear quarter panel and bumper. Not sure if it came from the wash brushes or brushes the employees use prewash, but I'm 100 sure they came from wiki. Stick to hand washing or pay someone. If you have to use a wash, I'd suggest Auto Bell.",1
"It is a nice place. Actually when i have just come in, everything seems to look normal. Nothing different frm other nail salons. However, when a lady did manicure and pedicure for me, she did really good service. She always smile a lot, and made you feel comfortable. I will come back soon and tell my friends abt this salon cause they did a good job.",2
"Bought a 3k bike here because they had my size. Took it bake for a "" complimentary tune up "" and they just seemed to not have any real interest in me. It was llike I was wasting their time. The techs do not provide much guidance and basically treat you like you really are bothering them. Sad, it is a nice shop.",1
"My favorite restaurant at the Wynn and really, one of the best sushi places I frequent and I eat sushi about 3 4 times a week . The fish here is so fresh, so soft, melts in your mouth. Tuna, Salmon, rainbow roll, spicy tuna, all great. Huge sake selection. Eat at the sushi bar for a more lively engaged experience or a table for a private setting.",2
"If your steamer is turned off because it's 1 hour from closing time, please inform us and we won't order. Don't nuke the crab legs. Leg meat was a string. I can't even find words to describe the misery of these crab legs. I sent it back and 10 minutes later, I got the same legs. Well, I'm sure it is not the same legs, but it was dried out as same way. 10 days old crab legs. Nothing else to say.",1
"was a little apprehensive about coming here because I didn't want to go somewhere wild for dinner but we got there early enough, it wasn't bad at all. Food was AMAZING, best hot dogs I've ever had, they were mini too and you could chose from numerous toppings. The staff was very helpful and friendly as well. We'll definitely be coming back!",2
"I wouldn't go to this auto repair shop nI've been constantly having to return to this place because of the engine shaking where they kept telling me it was the ""fuel injectors "" well today got all of them changed and behold it's still doing the exact same problems after paying them to ""fix it. "" Never returning to this shop again",1
"I don't mind coming here because the set up is pretty nice.I've had better. Better than what Charlotte proves I mean. Again, the set up is nice so I go. I takes a while before the staff will warm up to you. I don't know what it is but.not too folksy If you know what I mean. 100 a month for a membership for that small lounge.not gonna happen captain.",1
"Huge buffet with lots of items and I tasted most of them. They are all good and service is nice. But I knocked off one star as they don't have display names attached to each dish. In most cases we didn't know what we were eating. To avoid waiting time, be there before 11 AM for lunch and before 6 PM for dinner.",2
"All Californians love the In Out. and after a stressful ASU loss a couple weeks back. I had to get my burger on. These workers are the happiest I have seen. I love their red aprons and have always wondered, 'How can I get a big safety pin like that'? LOL. doesnt take much I guess to make me happy. just a cheeseburger.and fries. and oh yeah. Id love the big red safety pin and red apron too! ",2
"Meh. This place offers mediocre food, but a fun atmosphere. Looking for some great wings, I headed over the Quaker Steak and Lube after seeing it featured on Man V Food. Unfortunately, I was let down. The wings are not the best. Not very crunchy, and a lot of chewy skin. The sauce left something to be desired as well. If you are looking for a chain with wings, BWW's is a better bet.",1
"The first rule of Secret Pizza is YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT SECRET PIZZA. Seriously, guys, the wait is getting ridiculous. Tips n For full pies, call in your order for pick up in 30 mins. n It may smell irresistible, but do fight the urge to eat immediately. Otherwise, suffer from pizza palate. n Best spot for drunk people watching.",2
"You can't beat the value, and quality of a haircut from Dat at Brewington's Barber Shop. It's next to the Home Depot at the corner of South Blvd and Woodlawn. Nice people, only 13, and the cut is so much better than elsewhere. Give it a try. Brew does a great job also and is the former owner who works there.",2
After years of coming here I can confidently say that it is consistently awesome. The bakery is some of the best in town specializing in various jewish pastries you don't see so much in Madison. The potatoe nachos with some sriracha is my favorite along with the virtuous veggie with bacon added! The coffee is always good too!,2
I love coming to this place! The food is delicious and alway consistent! If your lucky enough to get a table out side u will have the pleasure of watching the private plans take off and land! Hopefully soon they will be able to expand so it isn't so crowed! Best breakfast spot in C town. However the service isn't the best. But I've had worse at other Chandler hot spots.,2
"Meh. The sushi was really uneven The spicy salmon was good, but anything with avocado in it was bad. Way too ripe. None of the sushi really stood out. Nothing seemed really fresh, everything was mushy. Service was slow and there was hardly anybody there. For a cheap sushi place it would have been fine, but it was pretty average.",1
"Great cupcakes, pleasant ambience, a lil gem of a place! nI first got their cupcakes through their partnership with Lufa Farms. nThe next weekend i went there on my own for more cupcake goodness! nMy only complaint is that i am on the other side of the city, but probably it's for the best for my diet i'd definitely be eating more than i need to",2
"So so bland food, served by some of the most witless clueless robots on God's green earth. At first, I thought they were just being sarcastic, but the fact is that the servers were so incompetant as to make to make me wonder if they were part of some program to hire mentally challenged. I truly feel sorry for them, and any customers they have to interact with. Sorry, just sorry.",1
"Great course but horrible staff. They have a ranger that will put you on the clock if you fall behind even if there's no one around you. Trust me, that will ruin your day. nIf you need to drive more then 20 minutes to get there don't! nToo many nice courses in AZ to choose that don't have a prick that follows you all day.",1
"Favorite place, and best location, in all of Old Town. Great patio, really great bartenders managers, unique menu, casual relaxed environment, inviting local feel but, like all places in Old Town, the crowd grows a bit more glitzy as evenings roll on , nice diverse mix among the clientele. The bartenders have always taken good care of me. hope they bring back the ""Pickled Mike "". ",2
Sandwiches were good the grilled cheese was HUGE! If I go back I would get that. Why not 5 stars they charge a dollar for tea refills and nothing comes with the sandwiches . They gave my friend and I a smoothie sample to try and I would get it again. I heard they deliver so my office might have to try that out sometime!,2
This is the worst nChateaubriand ever presented at a table nAt 84.00 not to serve nPotatoes nthey charge nExtra and vegetable serve raw ? nIt is a disgrace to nchateaubriand lover Meat excellent If I wanted meat only I would of ordered nA filet mignon And ask for side orders nTo garnish my plate This is why I ordered chateaubriand To surprise my wife What a deception to the MAX .,1
"We really enjoyed Cork. Not too loud like other places. My beef tartare needed more seasoning and the spinach was left off my entree, but the entree flavors were rich and delicious. My wife's filet was wonderful. Recommended, for sure the restaurant . She had a great salad with caramel corn and blue cheese.awesome. Give this place a try, for sure.",2
"Just an update now I have seen Ka, and my opinion of Zumanity remains the same. I think I know why Zumanity doesn't stand out. It's not so difficult to find super hawt performers. It's probably not so difficult to find amazing Cirque Du Soleil type performers. But it's probably VERY difficult to find super hawt performers of Cirque Du Soleil caliber, judging by the Zumanity performers.",1
"Unfortunately, the quality here is no longer any good. I recently went back for the secret menu and was disappointed that my steak was dry, burnt, appeared smaller than usual, and the shrimp was also dry. The value just isn't there anymore. They now require you to order a fountain drink with the secret menu, so 10 for a small, burnt piece of steak and shrimp isn't worth it.",1
"I joined a local friend here for dinner, and was very glad that she had recommended it. The food and service were excellent, and it was particularly fun having the high quality guacamole prepared fresh at our table. The hotel and grounds are also lovely, and I would have explored them a bit more thoroughly if it hadn't been raining.",2
This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had trying to get a hair cut. When I arrived my name was taken and I was told it would be a few minutes wait. After a half hour I asked how much longer it would be. The lady said umm and walked off never to return. Five minutes later I walked out. I will not be back here. If you enjoy poor customer service than this is the place for you.,1
"Pittsburgh, PA came to my small office because of having intermittent Internet connection. It was more like 80 down and 20 working. They assessed the problem and determined within 1 hour that the cabling was improperly configured with the router and modem. Very professional and swift. Just felt like a should return the favor by saying a big ""Thank you! """,2
"Definitely Order n1. Chipotle Chicken Avocado Hot Sandwich n2. Ham Egg 'N' Cheddar Breakfast Sandwich n3. Chocolate Chip Cookie Bites Maybe Try n1. Ham 'N' Swiss n2. Tomato Soup Skip n1. Brownie Bites not bad, but nothing special Great value for money considering it's available 24 7 and on the strip. You must try it at least once when you visit Vegas definitely worth the wait!",2
"I think it may be a crime to give fewer than five stars to Twisters. Seriously, they're awesome. Their soft serve try half chocolate, half vanilla! is probably the best on the planet and they offer homemade ice cream sandwiches. Everything is affordable, so you can easily feed your frozen dessert addiction. On hot days, or heck, even on lukewarm days, this is the place to be.",2
"Sushi Kaya is probably one of my most favorite sushi bar restaurant in Vegas. Tonight when I visited the food was delicious and everything was great until I saw a roach crawling up the wall by my table. I saw a previous review about seeing a roach but I was thinking that it was just maybe a little roach that came in on accident, until it happened to me as well.",1
"Great poutine, good duck, great halibut. Snotty, slow service. The hostess was rude and nearly nonverbal and I'm bilingual . The air conditioning was raining water on us, and she was mean about our request for a different table if possible. Though the food is excellent, there is equally inventive food with better service in Montreal.",1
"I love this place, very consistent all of the time and very friendly service. Only place around here that offers a drive thru. The portions are always big and everything always comes fresh on big platters. You can upgrade your meal to the Manager's Special for 1.50 and get a drink and egg rolls. It is housed in an ironic location surrounded by gyms.",2
"I would give it 5 stars but I had already had dinner and can't rate it completely because I only ordered a salad. The bread was to die for and the balsamic salad was delicious and fresh. I wish I would have waited to eat my meal here, I'm sure it would be amazing! Service was great and they even accommodated my 3 year old daughter.",2
"Great for families with kids. Loud, fun, funny and interactive. I would not recommend it for the older folks, say 65 and up. Great value. I got a good discount from Travelzoo. The drinks before the show are reasonably priced. I participated by being a volunteer and went on stage and actually won some nice headphones which was cool too.",2
"The hotel smelled very nice less smokey that most. The gaming tables were a lot of fun. The rooms were nothing special, but not bad, either. Biggest problem was valet services. Took nearly 20 minutes to get a taxi every time. The front was littered with trash every time there was a wind gust, we were pelted with dirt! Check in was also a lengthy process.",1
"Great experience, friendly wait staff and a cool location. We got drinks and shared an appetizer and a ""large plate "" and we were pretty happy with our meal. 4 stars because we couldn't get a table without a reservation or an hour wait but we really did enjoy the time we had in the bar area! No regrets! Check it out and if you have time, stop at changing hands next door!",2
If you want to have a night out in Vegas that lacks pretentiousness or the mainstream cheese ball factor then look no further. The drinks were priced about right for Vegas and the Irish band was good. A lot better than the Irish bands I heard when I was in Dublin city 4 months ago. The bartenders on the upper level were top notch and professional.,2
"One liner for quick reads Fresh made Hot and Sour soup! Yes.they make the Hot and Sour Soup when you order it.no gelatinous, nasty leftovers here. Service can be a little slow, but definitely worth it. Good overall food. Our favorite Chinese takeout. note.we always pick up, so I cannot comment on the delivery ",2
"I was looking for a new dry cleaner so I gave Polo Cleaners a shot based on the positive reviews. I was disappointed by the high prices 5 to dry clean a man's dress shirt, 7.50 for a blazer and 12.50 for a two piece suit pants jacket . The high prices might have been justified for same day service, but it was standard two day service.",1
"We went here for picnic food, so I can't speak to the raw ingredients, although they looked excellent. We got a number of different terrines here, which were each terrific. They also have a wide selection of confit duck legs, lamb, rabbit and a pretty good cheese section. We had several delightful picnics of items from here and the bakery next door . A gem in the neighborhood.",2
"Tim and Faith's Soul 2 Soul was a delightful surprise. Their chemistry and vocal ability was outstanding, their band top notch. .and the venue was GREAT to enjoy them in a intimate setting. The best part about this show as opposed to Shania's , was that this show is ALL about the vocalist. no crazy stage props, or ridiculous back up singers dancers. just Tim and Faith.",2
"Really nice mall located conveniently, has almost all the major department stores and smaller stores ie. Saks, Nordstrom, Gap, Banana, Zara, Victoria's Secret. It's really big, contrary to how it looks from outside, and the food court is on the third floor. Of course, it isn't really too special compared to. the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, but it's still nice for some down to earth shopping.",2
"Wow! So so disappointed, first thing the woman said was table no kids allowed at the bar . What service I get it no small children my daughter is 12 not really a tiny kid and she loves sushi! I believe it's my choice where I sit I am a paying customer . What a joke . Oh yeh and the grade from the health department wasn't even up. that isn't a good thing people. KAIZEN is the best in town anyway.",1
"If you're willing to deal with the staff's incompetence, then maybe the food is worth it. It is always an ordeal when you get to the end of the line and the cashiers are trying to figure out what you ordered, and the line is always held up. They aren't organized at all, and that is their biggest problem.",1
"My coworker introduced me to the Roasting Company and I'm really glad about it. This place is awesome. It's great for a decent lunch or dinner. The food is tasty and the selection of sides is impressive. It's relatively cheap, as you will pay under 10 per meal person. The workers are friendly and service is fast. Hooray for Roasting Company! ",2
"I've been here a few more times and I always love the food. Everything I've had from the breakfast menu has been fantastic! Drinks are good, too, and its a great place for happy hour. The deal on wine on Sundays is still my favorite thing about this place. They have Sunday ticket so they always have two games on but they keep the sound off closed caption so it doesn't get too sports bar y.",2
I had fun here a couple times and the place has really gone downhill. I kind of feel bad for some of the staff because it looks like this place has a major management issue. I also notice that every time I come it's a whole new staff. The drinks are also not as good as the other places around. I visited on NCOD weekend when the place should be packed but was a disappointment.,1
Dishes were well made. Flavors were distinct and came out pretty fast. Got the tasting menu prixe fixe 79. Paid about 100 per person. Loved the tartare. Portions are good with the number of courses. Only thing that threw me off was the chocolate peanut butter dessert. Didn't seem like anything special.,2
"I just left this place with my cousin and I've seen better places in California. I'll give them that the females are worth the 5 stars but them them being stuck up, place is small, with no private rooms, and loud music me thinks not. They were only half naked and even their nipples had paint on them what the hell? lol.",1
" upset I miss my Nordstrom at Tyson's and Houston Galleria. Service let us start off with the lack of customer service here in the shoes and jewelry department! How could you just give me a once look over and greet the person behind me? Well, thank you Charlotte's Nordstrom. I will stick with Neiman's.",1
"I've been to Keegan's a few times, and I would like to give this 2 1 2 stars bc it is exactly a middle of the road kind of place. The food was fine, atmosphere normal, drinks were drinks. Nothing stood out to me, but there was also nothiing wrong. I wouldn't suggest it if friends were getting together, but if someone else wanted to go, I wouldn't mind. but I wouldn't get the nachos ",1
"Should have checked the reviews first. This is a bad restaurant. First, they are inside Paris yet don't recognize status. But after sitting at table and ordering food I can't recommend at all. We asked for an extra plate since we were sharing rice we never got it. The food is not good. Don't waste your time",1
I was just told by the cashier that they would not honor the gift card that I bought from this location. I was told that they had created their own and that it cost money to redeem the one that I had. Interesting. They sold it to me and now they won't honor it. Sounds like stealing to me. I can't do business with a place like this. It is too bad as my son really enjoyed coming here.,1
"I have tried again and again with this Dunkin' Donuts location, but each time have been highly disappointed with the service. They are snippy, curt and I have seen some unclean practices. If you want to go to a better DD, there is one on Frank Lloyd Wright, one off Raintree and one on Hayden southbound. I gave it one star because I like DD.",1
Came here while my car was getting worked on at discount tire and I'm always in this area but have never seen this place super glad i found it! the fact that they have a drive thru is what made it even 1000x better! These past reviews seem a bit outdated! The staff was really friendly and helpful! I loved my drink and bagel will defiantly be coming back!,2
"Happy Hour 1 2 price wine by the glass is a great deal. Nice selection of reds. The pizza is tasty thin crust in the middle, chewy bread on the edges. We asked for a side of pesto to dip the crust in. Excellent. Great service. Parking can be a bit challenging. We were here a few days after graduation, so seating wasn't a problem. Might be crowded during the school year. ",2
"Do NOT go here. The bartender told me the burgers are done just right with a little pink on the inside. Mine showed up charred on the outside and 100 RAW inside. At first they tried to play it off like it was supposed to be a little pink and didn't want to admit their mistake. If you're in the mood for incredibly expensive burgers, I would recommend going elsewhere.",1
"Drinking water cause they got the pepsi. Food came out uncooked, slow service. Server tried to tell me thats how it is. really you serve mexican food with cheese that isn't melted? No visit from a manager or anything. this is a place ieed of a visit from restaurant impossible. I won't be going back.",1
"Use to really brag about Cyclo. don't know if the economy got the better of the business, or the owner is just gotten complacent, but I no longer go, or recommend it. The portions have gotten smaller, and the quality has gone down hill. One bright note. the owner is still funny, and sarcastic, which I love. Get your act together, and put the shine back on your gem!",1
"Must be one of my favorite buffets of all time. They offer a different variety of foods, not your typical buffet. I'm giving this 4 stars because of the variety and quality. The portion sizes are also not typical of buffets and some are served in individual dishes. Can't wait to go back and indulge for the next Vegas trip",2
This place is as good as it gets! Love the prices they're actually reasonable! The food is pretty good and high quality. The beer and wine selection is awesome. AND they don't feel the need to blast the music you can actually appreciate the quiet chatter of the room. Live music some days. LOVE this place!,2
"Great tiny ice cream place on St Laurent. Have a good variety of flavours, including some interesting, uncommon ones, all good. There's no place to sit and the place itself is so small it gets very crowded easily, but other than that there's not much to fault them with. I wish Ripples was open all year.",2
"Definitely leans more toward the Korean flavors than Japanese. The food was very good and the provided a lot of it! It is a very popular place and can get a bit crowded, but most of the folks there were regulars and all having a good time. The service was also very good. More like a family serving you than professional waiters. Very nice from a neighborhood restaurant. I will be back!",2
" u00c4lteres Restarant in Karlsruhe M u00fchlburg, viele Sitzpl u00e4tze, allerdings stark verwinkelt und schon etwas d u00fcster. Die Pizzen sind u00fcberdurchschnittlich gut, zur Mittagszeit im Preis reduziert. Service macht h u00e4ufig einen etwas m u00fcrrischen Eindruck, ist dehalb aber nicht langsam.",2
"I wasn't really a fan. In fact, this may hae been some of the most sub par Italian food I've had it seemed very touristy , and it was definitely my least favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh while traveling there on business the past few months. Cute ambiance! Cute neighborhood! Friendly local wait staff! But kinda touristy uninteresting food pairings ingredients.",1
I went inside to get a quick hair cut the staff were nQuite rude on yelp the open hours shows 9 5 nI walked in by 16 17 the place was fully crowded and the told me we can't have because we already closed which was a lie nThe hours of operation is till 5 pm nI'm guessing they just didn't like my accent!,1
I could never say enough of this wonderful caring veterinary clinic hospital. Dr. Emily Marcus and the whole team is Fabulous! I have a Pomeranian with diabetes and other issues. You are all professional and beautiful kind caring people. My Trixie has a much longer life ahead because of all of YOU. I thank you and so does Miss Trix.,2
SO. DIRTY. Saw this mess of trash sitting on tables outside thought they might be busy then went inside and ordered and sat out on the patio to eat. Birds greeted these dirty tables and no one came to clean it the WHOLE time we were there. And they weren't even busy! Ughh. Will not be going back to this location.,1
"This appears to be a must after a Pita Jungle meal. Even though I was stuffed, I knew I needed to stop in. I hardly ever come to places like these and get the first thing I try. Today was the exception. One bite of the Salted Caramel and I was hooked. With a TON of delicious looking and sounding options, this is a place I would frequent weekly if I was in the area.",2
"Eh. It's alright. Nothing to write home about. Just your usual fake, greasy, been sitting out for probably too long Asian buffet. Not my first choice, not my fifth choice and definitely not even my 10th choice for places to eat. I only eat here because my boyfriend and his family likes this place a little too much lol.",1
I have eaten here a few times on my trips to phoenix and I have to say that this is the best cheesesteak I have ever eaten. Fast and friendly service and great food. The rolls that the steak comes on are really really good and the meat with the cheese whiz is great. I love this place and there sweet potato frys. If you want a great experience come here!,2
I've been here many many times and have never had a bad time. Everything has always been up to par. I literally have no complaints. AND I recently dropped a personal check made out to me while getting cash out to pay my bill. The manager found it and mailed it back to my client. Talk about honest service. BJ's is our go to place for an easy weekend lunch. Their home brewed root beer is super good.,2
"I love the ice and an ocean water! Its your typical sonic. Good food and drinks. The people who work there are polite and hurry to get you your stuff. If I am thirsty, I like to stop here and get a diet ocean water. Hubby likes to get coke with cherries. You can also buy their ice if you are having a party. Not much else to report here. Check it out!",2
"We just had Argentinian food in downtown Pittsburg. amazingly tender meats, wonderful vegetables and tasty sauces. The owner chef is very kind and personable. His assistant is very fast too. Food is better tasting than many more far more expensive steak houses we have been to. There is a reason why this place had a all 5 star ratings . WELL DESERVED 5 STARS !",2
"One of the best fastfood options around This Chick fil A has friendly staff and are quick with their service. Food is good and sit better than the other fastfood places around. I really like their chicken soup when I'm battling a cold the warmth, perfect mix of noodle and chicken, and saltiness hit the spot.",2
"A year ago, this place was 4 or 5 stars. We were here on a Wednesday night the music was great outside on the patio, only reason I gave a 2nd star. Our server Holly was great too, but clearly over extended. The burger that arrived barely resembled the description on the menu see photo . Management, please get your shit together.",1
"My husband and I were really impressed with this little place! I'm kind of surprised to read he ruegative reviews because our experience was quite the opposite. Flavorful food, fun drinks, accommodating staff, awesome atmosphere. Best of all, very minimal Scottsdale douche baggery! We can't wait to go back!",2
The food is about average everytime I order. This is something I would not go out of my way for. The absolute WORST is when I order delivery for one sandwhich it take up to 2 hours! That is rediculous. The delivery driver is never apologetic either. Last time I will be ordering from them until they get better delivery drivers.,1
"its a dim sum mobile, how awesome is that? apparently, they forgot the awesome part of a dim sum mobile. its quite underwhelming. in terms of taste, its pretty bland for what you're paying and you only get one for each hand so 2 . thank god, its only 2 but at the same, i'm still quite hungry after this. it needs some love from the old lady pushing the cart!",1
Got there when it opened. We ordered a miso ramen and shoyu ramen. It was very good. I also had the uni and kampacha tuna. Can't complain. The owner gave me a side of fresh wasabi. Most Japanese restaurant don't even have that. Happy Hour from 5 7. Draft Kirin and Sapporo for 2. Go early cuz they get busy. I would definitely go back to Miko's again.,2
"I recently went here for lunch. I was there during the week and was seated right away. The restauarnt was pretty busy, but I had great service. I enjoyed my chicken ceaser sandwich with a bowl of soup. My waiter was kind and attentive. My food came quick and the price was right for the amount of food I got.",2
"Well looked good. Was told by many that the hotel was very nice. It could be Clean yes. But 85 bucks for dinner. Lame IT , could not get VPN and wireless sucked and TV in room did not work. No offer for comp just. Sorry for that. Not what a business traveler needs . Great your 25 and looking to party But 12 bucks for a Johnny red scotch ! Wow. Marriott or Hilton here I come.",1
Everything everyone just said in there reviews is true! Plus they don't clean there rooms but every 7 days. Yes 7 days they don't have room service you have to go down stairs to get your own towels etc you hope someone is at the front desk. This place doesn't even deserve a star more like a fallen star. Obviously I will not be coming back here again.,1
"My good friend got a promotion last week so we decided to take a night on the town. 6 starving students here, and we couldn't pass up on the affordability this company had offered. I must say, we had a blast. We stopped at two top notch clubs, and two great bars. Had drinks on the way to each of the locations. The hosting and service was friendly, informative and enthusiastic. Will use again.",2
Stopped in for lunch at 12 10 and they tell me I'm sorry sir we're out of pretzels we don't have any that are thawed out it's going to be two hours what a bunch of crap Poor management very disappointed with this gas station would not recommend anybody to come to this one dirty poor management what a waste of my time,1
"I am not sure what the hype is. I went here based on its recommendation in the who's who of restaurants publicized in the So Scottsdale magazine. It was mediocre, and the ambiance reminded me of eating at Disneyland, you knew it was make believe but you wanted to believe. I wanted to believe this was going to be a great meal, but instead it was lack luster.",1
"This place was way to pricey for me, especially having a ""laid back "" atmosphere. It is a trendy place and I feel like sucker for giving them my business. You don't pay top dollar for that kind of atmosphere. And paying 12 to 14 dollars for a little martini is outrageous. The food is good, not great. There are plenty of hole in the wall sushi places that give you great food for what you pay for.",1
"Huge fan of the show. I went off peak hours and nearly had the whole place to myself. Dennis was amazing talked about the show, commercials being filmed there, and shared a few behind the scenes moments. I sold an antique silver needle case just for the experience.for 7. Another check off the bucket list.",2
I used to be in the auto repair business years ago and I highly recommend Mr Inspection in Matthews. They are honest and will not find something that is not there. nThey have a full crew of 4 guys and you get in and out fast. PLEASE dont take your car for an inspection to any of the chains because you will be fleeced! Clark Tire Indian Trail found things that did not need repair.,2
"Delicious dinner on the patio last night. Anthony, our server, was very attentive but not hovering. We shared a bottle of the special 25 wine and the chicken dishes were excellently prepared. With a salad, one entree would have been enough to share. Delightful service, atmosphere and food. New to the neighborhood, and we will definitely visit again.",2
"For lunch I had the Porky it had roasted apples inside which added sweet detail. They have Boddingtons on tap that's my bff's favorite beer so I ordered one and sent him a pic for jealousy purposes. It's a good beer, a little thicker than I'd prefer but being too thick is never a bad thing. Service was friendly but slow.",2
"I don't normally eat pizza since being on my new life diet but had two slices at Barro's last week and was really impressed. This is NOT your normal dry, icky slice of overcooked pizza folks! The crust was just right and the toppings were fresh and superb! YUM. Well worth the drive to CopperBasin. Not to mention the decor and the booths make you relax and want to have fun.",2
"The food was OK at best. Tacos were dry, enchiladas were 90 cheese, guacamole was runny and strangely sweet obviously powder package . On top of the mediocre food they wouldn't take the restaurant.com coupon which was the reason to try eating here in the first place. Bottom line is I wouldn't go back.",1
"I was a bit dubious of this choice when I saw it but what the hell, outdoor patio, right? This was arguably the worst Mexican food that I've ever tasted. My enchiladas were lousy I felt like the sauce was made with tomato paste and even the high end margaritas tasted like a sweet mix. The waitstaff also seemed to be a bit out of it. I think the lesson learned is don't eat Mexican in Madison, WI.",1
"Had my 1st visit to this salon yesterday for a pedicure. The salon is clean, quiet music playing with the TV sound turned off. They have a whole menu of different pedis including hot stone. I got the 33.00 one gal did a very nice job. Gal who worked on my feet was very kind friendly. I will def return for a nail fill. I think I would like to try one of their facials massage too.",2
This was sadly my final return visit to this place. No cell phones this time and talking was at a minimum actually had the best massage I have gotten here to date.why the 1 star? Upon check out as the massage guy waited for his tip I was asked to give MORE tip by the cashier! Never again on principal alone go elsewhere.,1
"This place used to taste much better, now its just kinda plain and greasy. You do get big portions for a good price. I was not impressed the last few times I was here, and I was starving. They have coupons on the take out menus. you can get something free egg rolls for spending over 15. but you need to ask for it. It smells kinda funky inside. and servers cashiers could be nicer.",1
I came here for our first time it looks like something fun to go to. I asked the waitress what she recommended because I heard that their pancakes are really good and she said they were order their original pancakes I was sadly disappointed they were flat and hard I had to use a knife to cut them and they tasted very bland.i wont be back!,1
"I authorized work on Tuesday, they estimated it would be finished ""Early next week. "" I called Monday they said Tuesday. I called Tuesday they said Wednesday. I called THURSDAY and they said maybe later. IF they finish Thursday I won't be able to get it till Friday! What, the customer has a schedule too? Why is the repair business so often a license to steal your time?",1
"Be still my heart. I live a rock's throw away, so I'm here for both food and takeout on a very regular basis. I have tried a large portion of the menu, and I rarely find something I don't like. Get the AP10. It's a spring roll with a small egg roll inside. It defies logic. The dumplings are fantastic as well. There can be a wait, but then ignore your grumbling tums for an off time 3pm is great! .",2
My God in Heaven the Habe u00f1ro salsa is so good but so damn hot. I usually eat 2 3 bowls of it pre and post meal. It has such a great taste but wow is it hot. It leaves your mouth flaming hot for about an hour after eating it. If you are a chili head like me I highly recommend it but beware it's for real.,2
If anybody is still going to the big supplement chain stores you are out of your mind! At vegas discount nutrition you literally pay 1 2 of what you would at those places! And if you figure what shipping would cost and then having to wait for it if you bought it online you would find that its way better to come here.,2
"My friends were trying to use this service and were denied because they are a lesbian couple. In this state it is legal to get married regardless of your sexual preference and this is an outrage. Any company that doesn't value love and equality is not a company worthy of my dollar, and in my opinion shouldn't be worth yours.",1
"Good prime rib special, if you are a member of the casino club, free. Hawaiian breakfast available moco loco, spam and eggs, Porteguese sausage. Sometimes a bit of a line, but it moves quickly. You can get the house brewed beers, thier ""velvet "" stout is quite good. Not fancy, but more of a coffee shop.",2
"They fix flats for free regardless if you bought a tire from them. Their service is quick and their customer service is top of the line. They were very helpful! Unfortunately my flat was beyond fixing, but they had the exact same tire in stock and sold it to me for a reasonable price compared to what i saw online.",2
"This place is great. Omlettes, pancakes stuffed french toast its all great and they have something for everyones taste. Our server Karla was awesome! She described everything we asked about with great detail. I also like that they leave the coffee pot on your table so you never have to ask for a refill.",2
"Loud. Busy. And cold corn bread are the most memorable mentions. The cornbread is served to everyone. It's a great idea, but just warm it a little. And that Sunrise Breakfast Burrito. Well, it was made by a caucasian. It lacked Mexican taste altogether. My server was extremely well mannered and kind which was a nice reprieve from the stressful loudness.",1
"This would have to be one of the Nicest, and more expensive, places to eat around Las Vegas. Well worth it though when you're up from gambling, Great service and Relaxing Enviornment, plus Delicious and Filling dishes. My 46 NY Strip Potatoes was the best, and was even too big to finish. Great Seafood too, so says the other people in my party.",2
"Do you love pizza? Well if you do,then LGO is the perfect place to go. LGO has many toppings and flavors. Such as margarita, Mother earth veggie and spicy sausage. Really excellent. The pizzeria has fast service. It also serves homemade gelato. LGO is the perfect place to go to dinner and be with friends.",2
"I love this place. It's small, but I've had great service there twice. The clothing selection isn't that big, but there's usually some nice discounts. And if you're looking for good running exercise sneaks, this sure beats those bigger chain type places, especially if you're already a New Balance lover like me. In summary, great products, solid service and nice deals.",2
"Gemtime helped me repair a necklace that belongs to my wife. While much of their business is watch related, they also can do quality jewelry repair. Their service was excellent and affordable. The owners are friendly and once you get by the security gate the shop feels welcoming. I would definitely use them again.",2
"Recently upgraded to the new iPhone, and my sales rep Bill covertly added Vz Navigator 4.99 monthly and Protection iPhone 10 monthly without even mentioning these, or asking if I wanted them. I only discovered them later while reviewing my bill. I'm unsatisfied with my experience. Next time, I'll go to one of the kiosks at the mall.",1
"The gardens themselves are lovely. A nice little oasis in the desert. We saw multiple bunnies chipmunks. Theres a dogpark in this area too only drawback is if you dont know its there, youll never find it. Id rate this area a 5. The playground was just average a 3. Averaged together you get a 4. A nice place to play with the kids or the dogs.",2
Food was great but the service was awful. Don't think I will ever go back. But if you go try the portobello mushroom fries they are great. The steaks are good but if you order medium expect it to me more medium rare. Even the well done steak had pink in the middle. Just really disappointed in the service.,1
"Sweet potato fries Tastes like sweet potatoes, phew! nSin City Burger Okay, but wayyyyy too salty. nDeep fried pickles Terrible. Pickles are cut WAY too thick it's inedible because it is extremely salty and potent for something that's breaded. Cut the pickles SUPER THIN and you'll have a winner. Yeah. I didn't even want my leftover food packed to go.",1
"I always make it a point to stop by this place whenever I'm in Vegas. This business is located inside the miracle mile planet Hollywood ""the district. "" nThe line may be long but it moves very fast. All the sandwiches are served fresh, hot, tasty and in good size. A must if in Vegas! I wish they would open one in San Diego",2
This place is awesome. Very beautiful interior. The menu has a huge variety of shisha flavored and a wide selection of drinks and food. They don't have a full bar so you will have to go to the restaurant next door Mijana to get drinks. And the hookah is only 12 dollars you also don't have to buy a drink or pay cover . Definitely my favor hookah lounge in the Tempe Scottsdale area.,2
"Customer service is left to be desired to top a less than average bakery. We have now been there a few times, always wanting to give them another chance, but after they decline to honor a coupon that allegedly expired 11 hrs prior rather than 13 hrs later, who puts a time on their coupons BTW and offered no apology of any kind, we definitely just won't be back, not worth it.",1
"We enjoyed the beans and cole slaw very much but no one in my family likes the taste in the burger. It was very overpowering. The beans were a bit pricey. The place is cute but small. The kids were unhappy that there weren't fries. The menu was very limited and we probably won't return because of the strong taste in the meat. We are eager, however, to try the hot dog place when it opens.",1
"Time Square is a surprising hidden gem in North Phoenix. I love that they always seem to be improving either the exterior or interior. Right down the road from the Motorcycle Mechanics School, there are frequently some cool bikes out front. Great pizza and Italian food, they ALSO have a wonderful breakfast and if you get here before 9 00 am you can get 3.99 special.I LOVE the homefries.",2
"Definitely not worth a detour. nWhat bothered us is the extreme noise level loud rock music , the slow service, the prices are high because of the name on the door. It is also adjacent to the casino and therefore a lot of smoke comes into the place. nThe food was tasty but not a great deal. nWill not come back.",1
"I came here a couple times to kick it with some friends. The Hookah might seem expensive, but you can definitely hang there for a good 2 3 hours for 20 bucks. The booths are intimate and ample. Drinks are reasonable and the food is okay. They have a DJ spinning pretty good hip hop ethnic music. Bathrooms are clean enough, but I wouldn't recommend eating off the floors.",2
"Everytime I go, I get the same thing Uncle Sam's Ultra Special. It's a steak and cheese with extra meat, mushrooms, grilled onions, and peppers. This place has great steak and cheese, and they'll make it right in front of you. It's worth the wait. The bread tastes great. Their yam fries are good too.",2
All I can say is WOW! What a beautiful mall! Probably the best I have EVER been too. So fancy and everyone in every store seemed extra friendly and excited to help out. I really felt special the whole time I was there. Extra special shout out to ALL of the people working at the Gap. They won the difficult contest of being the friendliest and most helpful employees in the mall.,2
"I have eaten here a few times, not as much as I would like. Great sense of community here. Amazing home style cooking, the guy in the back really knows what hes doing. Quick, friendly, attentive service. Good looking chicks that work here. Prices are great once you taste the food and realize how much effort and care they put behind it. What else can you look for in a little diner cafe?",2
"Total rip off. Found out accidentally that they charge 1 per person for the tea which they automatically place in front of you whether you ask for it or not. I asked them how they determine who is and who isn't drinking the tea. They could not answer me. I usually order soda. Also, the quality of the food is not consistent and the service sucks.",1
"Visited 12 15 13. Still very much a fan. I always seem to get a good meal when I need a fix for BBQ. One thing I did not on last meal. nOrdered Burnt Ends and Rib combo. Unfortunately, these were not Burnt Ends. Too soft and a little fatty. It was still good, but not what I was expecting. Really wanted that ""burnt "" end taste. Otherwise, will continue to come back when in the area.",2
"if you take in a coupon for an oil change and tire rotation, they will tell you its finished before rotating your tires therefore, you have to tell them to jack it back up and honor their offer. I actually asked the guy if he rotated the tires and he said ""yes. "" what a joke. I had the same problem at Just Brakes. hard to find honesty even with large corporations like these.",1
This is one of my favorite salad places. Everytime I go the customer service is on point. The staff at this location is amazing. I always get the half sandwich and the salad bar. To my suprise the salad bar is always nearly kept and packed with fresh ingredients. I eat hear about 1 timer per week. The peaceful atmosphere is relaxing and easy to enjoy. Keep up the great work Jason's deli!,2
"Food is good, but the service is awful. Went for lunch yesterday. 35 minutes after we ordered our food still wasn't out. When asked, they said they knew the ticket system wasn't working. Ten minutes later we got our food. The manager visited the table next to us apologizing for their wait, then refunded their meals. They are clueless.",1
Nothing Bundt Cakes was a vendor at the Yelp Helps event last week. I tried every sample they offered. They were all A MAZING! It really was like no other cake I've tasted before. The cakes would make perfect gifts and would be a hit at any party. Highly recommended by a dessert snob! I need to visit their shop ASAP.,2
"I don't want to be the last person to taste this Amazing Rehab Burger. After I read all the cool damn reviews here. I can't wait any longer. Before the month ended last September at last we came here with my friends. Wow, this is the giant and coolest burger I've ever tried! Nacho Taco Burger is the best!",2
"This was one of our worst hotel experiences ever. We had to contact the hotel desk everyday of our 4 night stay as something was wrong or missing in the room. nRooms used and dirty, you can smell cigarette smoke every where. nOur room door did not seal correctly so there was a constant whistling sound. Ended up stacking towels and pillows against it. nWould not recommend this place.",1
Visitung Arizona because a close family friend is going to a treatment center for stomach cancer. She has no appetite but Nourish had food that was delicious and healthy for her. We didn't wait to long for our food to be ready. She got a yogurt cup in the refrigerator that she loved and ate for breakfast the next morning. We will defiantly be back while visiting. Thank you Nourish.,2
"I'm am so proud to have a institution that preserves my culture. The Kinsey exhibit is phenomenal . I suggest everyone go, and be inspired. I know more now than when I walked in there. My favorite exhibit was Slavery and Reconstruction. Take in every document. This will help start the conversation America needs to have.",2
"We ate here using a Groupon. Our primary interest was to view the car collection, which was awesome. However, I was also impressed with the food. I requested fettucini Alfredo with chicken although it was not on the menu and to my surprise the staff was willing to accommodate and it was very good! We had a great time here.",2
"I have never reviewed before but I feel that it is necessary to do so on this place. This place was aweful. Haircut was uneven and shorter than requested. When I brought it up, not even an apology.had to have then fix it but not even an offer of a discount or anything for the terrible job they did. I will never go back there.",1
"So, I had two additional Groupons for this place cause I loved their work so much. Because it was close to expiring, I couldn't get an appointment and they said there was nothing they can do cause it's Groupon's rules. I've had other places extend the expiry when they can't take all their customers. Actually, many places have done this. So, now I'm out 50 for two non used Groupons ",1
"I've been to Sushi Catcher 4 5 times in the past few months. Have had a rainbow roll, casey roll, and spicy salmon roll. All were very fresh, tasty, and melt in your mouth delicious. The prices are very reasonable, and staff are always friendly and gracious. I have sushi 1 2X week, and this has become my place to go in the Phoenix area.",2
"They are great! every bit of advice makes total sense, and if you just take time to practice their simple techniques you and your dogs lives will be much easier and more fulfilling. I have seen a huge shift in my dog's behavior since taking her to their basic manners class. It is well worth the money!",2
"Love this place! I've been here many many times. It's very authentic. All the servers are mexican. I like that. It seems family owned. There's no bar, just beer and wine and I think they have liquor but they make it in the back. They have nice spicy sauces. The habanero is SUPER hot, I like the tomatillo.",2
"Or La Taverne Monkland. Very good food, fantastic atmosphere. A tad pricey compared to a nice downtown restaurant but Monkland village is becoming more and more a trendy destination to eat. You can park on a side street to save from meter parking and buy a cappuccino after dinner instead! Only negative is that they don't take reservations so you may have to line up.bit of a bummer.",2
had tickets to see Margaret Cho on 10 11.got a call 3 hrs before the 7 30 show saying they had power outage and the show was cancelled.but if we wanted to we could come to the 10pm show. we asked if they would be willing to comp our 2 drink minimum but they were not willing to do that so we just got a refund,1
I heard great things about this particular buffet but it just reminded me of a higher quality old country buffet. the food was unoriginal and there weren't that many options. and the maki rolls.sigh. The line is unnecessary long and i would recommend visiting another buffet. the wait is not worth it.,1
"My kids love Taco Bell, I love to take them here because it's cheap lol. Usually we go to the one down the road because every single time I come to this one, they always seem to either screw up the order, or short change all the food by stuffing it full of lettuce and barely any ""meat "" so do your self a favor, drive the extra couple miles to avoid this Taco Bell",1
"I cannot rave enough about this place. It's simply amazing! It is under new ownership it has really taken a step up. They have a million colors including gels glitter. Tony has been doing my nails ever since I moved to Vegas I would never go to another. He has great designs is extremely talented. Can't wait to go back! Good work, Tony!",2
"It's a chain, so I'm not going to comment on the food. I've been to other Buffalo Wild Wing locations, and they are fine. Wings, sauce, beer.it's all good. The only reason I am reviewing this place is because the bartenders and service were absolutely HORRID! ""We are attitude! "" There are plenty of great places in Uptown Charlotte.please help to put THIS one out of business!",1
"We've been coming here for the last couple years. Everything's always been good except one day my sliders were undercooked and I would've went back to complain but was too lazy. Since then we have went back and everything has been a'okay. By the way, they don't serve sliders anymore and have new chicken strips that are great and cheaper than anything else on the menu!",1
The Mexican eggs benedict was awesome. One star off because they don't have Sriracha but I'm pretty sure we talked them into getting some so they can still win it back. The French toast was also awesome. The location is cute and a nice size. I think this was a great addition to the area. Get some Japanese cold brew.,2
"Scam! I paid 440 for two VIP tickets to the Dream that specifically said it includes admission to XS. But when my girlfriend and I got there, the people in charge said ""we don't honor these, sorry now pay 80. I complained, and all they said was too bad! I will report this to consumer affairs and show them the video of the manager saying ""we don't honor VIP tickets regardless if you paid for them """,1
"I was very happy with the food here I got a full size rice bowl, and it made for two very large meals, all for about 9. Can't beat that with a stick. On top of that, it was super tasty. Although, don't go there expecting any spice. At all. Even their ""spicy teriyaki "" sauce didn't have so much as a hint of spice. This will definitely be added to my list of lunch spots in the area.",2
"I've been eating at the Landmark for years, and it still serves up the same great salad bar. While the entrees are good, albeit pricey, I mainly go here to pig out on items from the salad bar room. This isn't just salad, it also has 2 kinds of soup, 2 counters of hot items which has items such as meatballs and bbq chicken , and very unique cold items you don't see often such as pickled watermelon.",2
"Very tasty waffles. The prices are fairly reasonable and the service was fast. The place is very small. There's seating for about 6 8 people total and the narrow entranceway is also where the line forms. When I showed up, after finishing my waffle, I had to navigate a large gaggle of people waiting to order.",2
"The name says it all they ensured me good times and me and my girls were treated like VIPs. Good Times VIP got us in to great spots, we didn't have to wait on a single line, they had great recommendations. Two of my favorites were Marquee and Wet Republic will certainly always remember that weekend. Thank you, Good Times VIP!",2
"Ordered one of the boats with some coworkers and the fish was not very good. It wasn't fresh and the rice wasn't good either. If you're a person who eats a lot of rice, you can tell the rice wasn't cooked right because it was hard, cold, and just not right. I wouldn't recommend this place for sushi and I don't think I would come back here again for sushi. Sorry ",1
"I like to come here during the day to relax. These margaritas and any other kinds of drinks you might fancy are available. I haven't had food here, but I'm sure it's up to par with these nice margaritas. It's a tourist trap, but I am one of the tourists when I come to Vegas. Margaritaville is one of gems in alcohol heaven aka Las Vegas.",2
"One of the weakest clubs I've been to in Vegas. I got in for free which was cool thank god . No one should ever pay to get into this nightclub, it's just that weak. I heard from different sources that it would be hard to get in and that it was very exclusive. Maybe I was told wrong? Anyway, don't even waste your time here. Go elsewhere if you want to experience the great nightlife in Vegas.",1
"Meaghan has been doing my hair for 18years and she is amazing! I have followed her all over the city! She is very precise on her color, blending highlights and a perfect hair cut every time! I highly recommend give her a try and I promise you will be in love. She is also very reasonable priced for the excellent services! I love going to see her!",2
i just got flowers this last Thursday they already dead the water was gross and the roses pedals where coming off i told she needs to change them if i didn't say anything she would have left them there and i was change a 100 dollars for dead roses I would had better luck with grocery flowers never again,1
"The food and the service was just not up to par. The manager did try to make it better, but in the end the food was not good, could not even chew the lobster claw it was so dry, however my friends ordered bronzini and also salmon and they said it was ok.the snobby waiter was awuful. Would not recommend would never go back.staying at bellagio for the week, definitely not trying it again.",1
FINALLY we find a 24 hour coffee shop. Tired of going out and wanting coffee after 10 pm only to find the only place is Dennys for coffee ick. Heard about Jobot nice local coffee house on the newly refurbished Roosevelt row. Also serve food 24 hours. Lots of artists and urban hipsters but a damn fine cup of coffee after 10 pm.,2
"If you are 21 29 this is a great place. if you are 1 day past your 29 birthday, you should seek a different hotel. The rooms are great, the pool after WAY TOO MUCH security is ok it is more like a club . However security and executive staff is a joke and apparently outside guests non hotel guests are allowed to roam the entire hotel, pool, elevator areas, etc. 9 14 at that hotel was a JOKE",1
"The wait was horrible! I live right around the corner so I went to this new location. So disappointed! Went through the drive through cuz that's usually pretty quick.WRONG! There was 2 cars in front of me and it took a total of 35 minutes! I could've gone to the Mesa location and gotten back within that amount of time. So sad because I love this place but gosh, the wait sucked!",1
"I guess I was expecting more. The idea of taking food grown locally on farms to prepare dishes was good. But I guess growing local and being ""fresh "" come at a cost. Food was ok, just didn't believe it should be so expensive. It was also very smokey inside due to the kitchen being in the middle of the room.",1
"Walked in to order takeout about 20 min before closing and was welcomed with a smile. good start Cute and simple little place seems family owned. Not very busy but then again it was a Tuesday night. Came out 15 min later with a mix of delicious nigiri, sashimi and maki. Reasonably priced, 30 for 19 pieces. Will definitely go back.",2
"I don't like the little pots that everyone else seems to be crazy about? I thought the food was bland and not as hot as it should have been. We cam for lunch. THere was nothing particularly special about the food. The service wasn't great either. The waiter came to our table once. And we had half a dozen ""little pots "" piled up! It was a pretty place. but the food wasn't even average.",1
"Chicken adobo is a SAD, SAD, SAD excuse for the dish. After 6 of us tried it and repulsed in disappointment, I handed it back to the truck and didn't even ask for a refund. The glass noodle dish was half way decent, but really bland. All in all, the ""Filipino "" food this truck slings out is garbage and unworthy of the title. Tied for worst truck of the day at Street Eats AZ.AVOID!",1
I just wanted a smoothie. The place is dead at 3 am yet it takes 20 minutes to take the order. Another 15 minutes to blend it and put it in a cup bc the employees are too busy chatting. One employee hitting on the cashier. Not that the cashier was too bright. she forgot she was making it. So stupid. Hope management cleans house,1
"This was not going out to eat, it was a true dining experience! The food was fantastic, the service was outstanding and manager, William Mischke made sure we got the most beautiful view of the city. My girlfriend and I are already planning our next visit. I highly recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed.",2
"Went here twice on my recent trip Wednesday night and Friday night . No cover charge and decently priced drinks Friday night 5 Jack and Diets . Wednesday night they let my friend and I dance up next to the pianos and get completely crazy so I was happy. If you want to sit, enjoy some music, meet new people, and have a great time for not a lot of money then check it out!",2
Absolutely amazing food! I love the home feel to the place. It takes me back to sitting in my grandpa's kitchen as he made very similar breakfasts for us! My all time favorite breakfast joint. The biscuits and gravy or chicken friend steak are the best! Highly recommended and keep up the good work guys!,2
"Entertaining show with immense, immense talent. I always love cirque shows because I cannot even fathom having the skills those people have! This show was a little slow in parts so minus one star. But the acrobatics and the flying man with the cube are exquisite and for sure do not try at home stunts.",2

The Service was horrible. The Kids said the steak was tough! They charged for chip refills! which is terrible enough and nThey never told us in advance. Really disappointing. Did I mention the service was horrible. And they weren't even that busy. Never brought drinks needed to remind them four times for silverware ? Ridiculous,1
"I didn't like the free samples and I should have just walked away. However, there isn't much for quick snacks at the Premium Outlets that you don't have to stand in a long line for. A pretzel and a pretzel dog later, my stomach wished I had just went else where. I guess it's not for everyone and that everyone is me. If you disagree, that's ok you can have them all for yourself",1
"We love this place! The food is always delicious. Our favorite is the hibachi but the sushi is good as well. The service is great. We have never had a bad experience here or at the southeast location. My husband always requests to go here for birthdays and other special occasions. Don't fear the pink rice, it is delicious!",2
"We love this place for lunch! It's near my husband's work and we go often. The service is good and quick, so he's never stressed about time. They have a lunch special which runs 7 9, depending on what type of pizza you choose. You get a decent sized slice and an abundant side salad, as well as a drink for that price. You can't beat that for lunch these days.",2
"This place is tough to find if you don't know about it. It's inside the Golden Gate Casino and well worth searching out. Most of us got the prime rib special and loved it. The owner came by our table and chatted with us to make sure everything was good, which is something you rarely see in this day and age. Great find for us, I look forward to visiting again.",2
"Great place to hang out or eat! The food is good and the beer is wonderful! The pretzels are to die for. They brew their own beer and do an incredible job. I am a bit of a beer snob and enjoy theirs immensely. The only downside to Four Peaks is that it is always busy. I mean crazy busy. However, the staff does a nice job of getting you into a table as quick as possible.",2
"They might have a similar menu and setup to Chipotle, but the food is NO BUENO! There is just something about it that's not good. I don't know if the chicken that totally lacks texture or the corn chips that taste more like corn oil. I want so bad to like this place because it's close to my house. I have tried to go there like three times now, and I won't be back. Sorry!",1
"This store is always clean, usually empty and stocked up pretty well. Pricier though when comparing the price tags next door target . They might not have everything but they have a little of everything. Tmnt collection is good, Lego collection is solid, nerf guns everywhere. My wife and I also did a lot of our baby registery shopping. They're easy and understandable on exchanges and returns.",2
"mmmmmm Kabob. I enjoyed this place and will go back, perhaps today. They serve Lebanese style meats with rice and pita. They've got a great lunch special which comes with 4 different types of meat, rice, salad and pita for like 6.50! Everything was very tasty and seemed fresh. My only complaint was some of the meats were a little bland, but not too bad, I just like a LOT of flavor.",2
This review is for Noodles restaurant at the Bellagio not impressed! Dinner for four and really looking forward to some great crab noodles until I picked up the nasty black worm in my food. The waiter was apologetic and offered to replace the dish but I was so grossed out I couldn't eat anything. Manager sent a mango pudding as consolation but not what you expect at the Bellagio.,1
"Good steak, cooked right, with great service. Our waitress was very nice, my salad was great, my baked potato was great and my steak was excellent. The beer was cold and the bread was good as ever. My only complaint was the Texas Chili I ordered was cold. We were here on a Monday night around 08 30pm and it was pretty busy",2
This was our first visit to the newly re opened restaurant. The food was very good and we enjoyed all of the chaat selections we ordered. I will say that service was very slow and the food took a while to come out. But I am hoping that was due to their inexperience and that they will get more efficient. This is a nice option to have in this area and I am hopeful that their business will make it.,2
"This is near my house, so i go here every chance i get. their quiche is flaky, cheesy and baked perfectly. Their macaroons are delicious and only 1 each, i recommend their chocolate pistachio! Their other pastries and cakes are delicious also. Definitely step out of your comfort zone and get an assortment of baked goodness!",2
"I went in to get dinner for my son and I, ordered two Katsu chickens or 18s as it was listed. Got home and sat down to eat and as I began to eat I realized that the food was not hot and the chickens looked as if had been out into cold grease or had been sitting for awhile. Needless to say we tossed it and decided to cook after all.didn't want to chance it.",1
"Good solid Buffet. The guy grilling was on top of it. The seasonings bar was need too, you can add whatever you wanted to any of the food. I used some Emeril seasonings on the steak. The staff was nice, but they started to charge extra for the Beverage bar. drinks are no longer included unless your a kid.",2
"Deeelicuous! Ribs sausage. Dry rub, meat falling off the bone. Plenty of sausage tasty, with just a touch of sauce. Food came out fast hot. Hit the spot. Throw in an attentive waitress, what else can you say? Could have used a few more selections, like corn on the cob, and I prefer my cole slaw with vinegar, but yum",2
"We left after the bar tender insulted my friend. I can see having a bad night, but do not take it out on your customers. To top off our bad experience, this place steals your money. We asked for our check after dealing with the offensive bar tender, and wrote NO TIP on the tip line. Later my cleared bank statement says the jerk gave himself a 5 tip! That is not ok!",1
"Yes I love thee. let me count the ways 1. The ambience is edgy trendy, but comfortable. 2. The libations are simply divine they can make anything you can dream up. 3. The Butternut Squash Ravioli had pancetta. ""Hello, Lover! "" Make sure to call ahead for reservations, and you can always wait in the bar lounge. they will come and sweep you off your feet when your table is ready.",2
"Fantastic Service. I called regarding a leak in my house this morning and Dennis arrived in 20 minutes. I mean, I was still talking about what to do about the leak and they were at the door. The service was fast, professional and very cost effective. Even the advice on making sure to avoid mold was worth it. I could not recommend them enough. Thank you so much for the efforts.",2
The new show was amazing! I was so impressed with the creativity. Celine brought lots of family video and photos of her family. She also talked about them. I felt honored that she would share such personal times. Everything was done to perfection. It was a family members 60th birhtday and she enjoyed it so very much,2
"Among all the great restaurants in Vegas, this is definitely the best. The atomosphere is relaxing with chic black decor. The food is excellent. All the dishes look like demo from TV top chef cooking show. most important. not only looking good but tasting great.The dessert is far and above anything you can expect. Try it. You won't regret a penny you spend there.",2
"We went here on a Monday night because everything else was closed. The crepes were delicious. It is byob and we drank too much wine. We asked to order dessert crepes and they said that they closed a half hour prior.but then the chef said what the hell and made us more food. Very reasonable price, nice space, friendly staff and good food.",2
Don't bring kids here.this a family restaurant that doesn't want kids. Staff is disrespectful to kids and families with small kids. Decent product poor staff and management. In fact unless you are perfect like the staff don't go here. Did I mention that being insulted by staff members is encouraged here?,1
"I'm gonna do you a favor. come here and order 10 'honey hot' flavored wings. Then go on yelp and thank me. Take it from a guy who isn't exactly a ""die hard chicken wing fan "" nor do I enjoy spicy food. these honey hot wings are awesome. Just the right amount of everything. The restaurant is easy to miss. it's in a strip mall between the Firestone and Laser Quest. Can't wait to go back!",2
"There's really something for everyone at this Tempe kosher style deli, which attracts a lot of ASU students and families due to its close proximity to campus You can get crepes, lox and cream cheese and herring along with pancakes, grilled cheese, a BLT or meatloaf. The choices seem endless and the menu is almost intimidating. And the prices? Cheap!",2
"I love this place. The machines are great and there are plenty of them. You cannot beat the price and it is 24 hours so anyone can go. My only complaint is some of the staff members. Some of them seem bored with their job and it is an inconvenience for them when we come in. If this is a judgment free zone, someone should let them know.",2
Visited this restaurant for a friends birthday. The restaurant itself was beautiful and unique. Not many other restaurants offer a view of skydivers and roller coaster rides. The staff was friendly and helpful with suggestions. The food and drinks itself were a bit pricey but everything was delicious.,2
"I'm not crazy about the Blue Burrito Grill. I like that they have all you can eat chips and salsa. They are serve yourself and the salsa are good. I usually get the vegetarian burrito bowl and for some reason it always ends up watery and not very flavorful. I think Chipotle, Qdoba, and Fiesta Burrito are a lot better.",1
"Got some take out from here since it's near my sister's place. Man, what a great choice! We got some spring rolls, chicken fried rice, shrimp lo mein, basil chicken and chicken curry. All the dishes were excellent, with the proteins cooked to perfection! Spicing was sublime and even the take away chopsticks were fabulous. Highly recommended!",2
"The Cosmopolitan is gorgeous, and Milos is right up with it. The restaurant is classy and clean and beautiful. The service is excellent and the food is really good. We went for lunch and wow, I want to go for dinner. Their lunch is perfect, I had the bass and it was out of this world. I really can't say enough nice things about this restaurant so go and try it ",2
"The bar is nice as a bar, but thats all this is, a bar, that plays country music. LAME! No dancing? Way LAME! The screens and tv's are huge. We watched the Silva Weidman fight here and really liked the visibility and lay out of the tv's. I'm sure I'll come back for football season and other fights, but I expect a lot more from a name like ""Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row "".",1
Super petite boulangerie avec du personnel agr u00e9able! Les petits pains au chocolat sont d u00e9licieux mais surtout il faut essayer la tarte au lime et meringue et puis le g u00e2teau au chocolat ! Ils sont d u00e9licieux. Dommage que les p u00e2tisseries co u00fbtent cher! Sinon je m'y arr u00eaterais plus souvent ,2
I've been here multiple times and I have never been anything but impressed with service and staff. I've tried so many of their entrees and they all have been great. A few of my favorites are the Rice Bowl and Phoenix Burger. nI have friends who visit and the first thing we do is go get them a burger.,2
"Have eaten at a few Brazilian grills in the pat from Albuquerque to Washington DC. Pampas was definitely not the best. The service was average, but the cleanliness of the restaurant was very poor. The floor seemed like an oil slick and the walls were splattered with food and drink. Wouldn't recommend. Disappointment.",1
"This place is sooo cool. They have pinball machines as far back to the 50's. Even though these r old machines, they r in good working shape. Can spend hrs in here. Some machines have notecards with the history on them, interesting, dont skip over them. Luv the .25 popcorn machine, who knows how long that popcorns been in there. Next time I'll bring my kids.",2
"Absolutely the best place for breakfast! We come to this location a lot. The service is always awesome and so is the food. We haven't tried the lunch or dinner, so that's something to try one night! If it is your first time visiting, you have to try any dish with the spuds and their warm banana nut bread. I always get the meat lovers skillet.",2
"Middle of the road food, good service. nThe quality of the food was about the same as one of those chain Italian restaurants you find on an outer drive outside a shopping mall. The service was good, like it ought to be on the Las Vegas Strip. nNot bad. nNot great. nNot a good value. nI would return.",1
"Gave this place another shot. The lemonade was definitely much improved, and some of the food was good. The pulled pork was a little greasy, but the pork ribs were great. I would be temped to give this place three stars, but not at a bill of 20. For lunch. ""Overpriced "" is still the best way to describe the joint.",1
"The only complaint I have with Pike's is they moved their main Soda Shop from my neighborhood! I live a few blocks from Pike's Pharmacy and the original Soda Shop was next to it. Then they went ""yuppy "" and closed that one down. There is another restaurant in there now. I guess the old neighborhood wasn't good enough for them!",1
"This is one of the best Five Guys locations that I have been to. Other Five Guys in the US are starting to be lighter on the toppings. At this location, they piled on the toppings, just like how Five Guys did it a few years ago. Therefore, if you are from the US and want your Five Guys fill, you won't be disappointed.",2
"The menu is a vegetarian's nightmare. You are pretty much stuck with either nachos does not include beans or a veggie burger obvious microwaved boca burger . They do have shuffle board, but you have to pay, and its timed, so make sure you pee prior to dropping in your quarters because you got maybe 15 minutes to bust that game out or your screwed.",1
"I had a great visit at Johnny Rockets! Our burgers were tasty, while the fries were crispy. our server made sure to handle all our needs, and The staff was all very attentive while working. We enjoyed the staff dancing so much, and we received ketchup faces with our meal! We will sure be back for a fun visit!",2
"I love Dr. Ghuman and his staff. He takes time to listen to you and your concerns. When you make a treatment goal, he does everything in his power to meet or even exceed those goals. He takes care of every patient that walks through his doors. It's a drive, but a drive well worth it. I'd send anyone who has had back pain or who suffers from headaches to this office.",2
"This store carries a very limited supply of shoes and clothing and not the hip, cool items offered on the New Balance website. It's independently owned and they will not place special orders from New Balance and have it shipped to the store. They just want to sell you the overpriced, outdated merchandise in stock. Note to self . never shop here in the future!",1
"Myself and two friends came here to only get terrible service, comically bad. Our appetizer showed up two hours after we ordered it, after we had eaten our meal, and after we had asked to cancel it. And they still charged us for it. Almost none of the adult beverages on the menu were available. We all got food poisoning too. Baffled this place is still open.",1
"Ive been coming to Thai Spice for 20 years, but tonight was the first time Ive eaten here in awhile.and yeah, it was as good as I remembered. I think they have the best pad thai in town. A nice size portion and the flavor is spot on.so good. Service was prompt and courteous. .overall.pleasant experience. Ill be back sooner than later!",2
"This place use to be really good. Good food and good staff. Paid 10 for 4 chicken breast sliders that were not even real chicken, more like formed chicken with rib meat and chunks of fat. Slow service. Messy bar. Only comped one pint of beer after gambling 1 hands at blackjack over 2 hours. Definitely not what I remember coming too when I still lived on that side of town a year ago.",1
"harris grill, i think your menu is trying too hard. first place i went on my visit to pittsburgh. menu was a little overly silly, waitress was a little underly friendly helpful timely, and food, while decent, was overpriced for the quality. i may be back to pittsburgh, but won't be back to harris grill",1
"Oh My Friggin Goodness! This place is SO amazing! It didn't hurt that the person cooking for me was the owner but I'm sure it would be amazing whoever was taking care of us. All of the sauces are to die for and the fried rice is out of this world! Since it was a late dinner, it got a little, um, Vegas but it was so much fun! Do yourself a BIG favor and take a trip there!",2
"I was as customer on Sat, Feb 2nd, and now I am getting around to my updates. nGood food for the , easy access, and decent, attentive wait staff. I read all the latest reviews on this place and might I say some of the negative ones must have just been very unlucky. One note get there early as the closer to dinner the longer the wait.",2
"Happy Hour at Howl at the Moon! What a hysterical time. The piano players are hilarious, butchering every song from Elton John to Biz Markie. The drink specials were just ok, but the wait staff is friendly and extremely attentive. I really enjoyed the crowd mix the age and diversity contributed to the music mix and made for a terrific time.",2
"Love this place, it rocks, the food is amazing , the staff is super friendly. Their cheese and meat plates are way better than other wine shops in the area. I'm a bit of a food snob and don't do chain restaurants also being from south Florida finding decent places to eat around here is pretty difficult . so in my eyes this place is awesome.",2
"I Live close but will stop eating there. The service was slow, my friend complanned about a order he had and they said ow next time tell them to make it different for you? Really then I ordered another simple California roll Took forever. The Sushi is allright but the overall experience is worth driving somewhere else you lost me.",1
"I had the absolute greatest retail experience ever tonight. I wish I had gotten the name of the saleswoman with the lovely European accent. She was absolutely delightful! The best I have ever encountered. I didn't stop smiling for a moment the whole time I was in the store. The products here are fantastic and so very elegant, and I really can't compliment the staff enough. She was amazing!",2
"For a place that specializes in burgers I was expecting more. After waiting an hour for our meal, the beef burgers were eh, OK, and the veggie burger was unappetizing all rice, falling apart, and bland. I needed a fork to eat a burger. The waitress stopped by a total of 6 times in a 2 hour period. I will not be coming back to this over priced waiting lounge.",1
"Went in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The Conservative is DELICIOUS and their salads are excellent as well. The menu is a bit pricey, but fair given the large portion size. I would have preferred a smaller portion with less cost. Definitely would recommend Layers to anyone looking for a yummy lunch.",2
"The family and I had the worst experience ever. I was there on 3 26 2014. The rooms are not as clean, and customer service is rude. The valet parking sucks they have you waiting for 1 2 an hour. The food was horrible. NEVER EVER GOING BACK! The only reason I reserved this hotel was for my kids to go on the rides. Also, because my friend told me it was good for the price! Yah rite!",1
"Well this was a nice surprise. Cute little eatery hiding in Smith's plaza. I got the Flat Iron Steak. Hon got the Oak Roasted Chicken. Daughter got the Kobe Beef Sliders. I was good, daughter was good. Hon broke out the salt and pepper. Not bad just not what she was expecting. Clean plates though. Def going to be back. There's a whole pizza menu waiting! Can't wait to get back.",2
"Petite boutique pr u00eat de la plazza St Hubert, la fromagerie Beaubien est vraiment une belle d u00e9couverte pour moi. Il y a un beau choix de fromage et les employ u00e9s y sont vraiment connaissant et patient. Ils n'h u00e9siteront pas a vous poser des questions pour bien conna u00eetre vos pr u00e9f u00e9rences. Je suis fan!",2
Fabulous Food! Great Location! Fabulous customer service! The food was great will go again! Have already told at least 10 other people to go try it out! Fun little spot! Make sure to make reservations as they get very busy! The people working there where so helpful kind all had a beautiful smile! Can't wait to go again!,2
"Terrible experience at this office, the doctor seemed not to be knowledge examination took 5 minute after received the direction how to take my medicine in a stickier note it was incompletely, headed to the Pharmacy to buy it, have to wait 40 minutes because they did not send the prescription to the Pharmacy had to call them back to see what was going on. I'll never go back there for sure.",1
The music is a variety the drinks are mostly juice. I orders two cranberry and vodka at 7 each and they where both watered down w little vodka. Also we ordered buckets of beer but every time we stood up to dance the staff would clear the tables even with beer still in the bottles. We literally could not leave our table without bottles jacked!,1
"Best clearance sales when coordinated with a Dillard's card. Scored on 2 Perry Ellis polos, a Hugo Boss T shirt, two pairs of Calvin Klein trunks, Hugo Boss swimming suit for 118.00. Cha Ching! Sales staff is helpful and relaxed, only annoying thing is sometimes the dressing rooms are trashed out with mounds of clothing laying everywhere.",2
"Did we just get there TOO early or what? I heard good things about this and dragged my friends there after the buffet. It had 1 long table and some smaller ones on the other side. Where's the live music? No one was at the front and when we walked in, there were about half dozen people drinking. No music, no service. Walked in and walked out.",1
"Prob was good back in the day. Inside looks it did 20 years ago if I had to guess. Food was okay, mostly reheated. It tasted good but did not want make me want to come back. Sweet tea was spot on. Waitress was friendly. They do not clear your table of any plates until you leave so don't plan on staying and visiting at your table.",1
"Got free tickets, the music was good, so it was not to bad, but if i forked out the 50 bucks for tickets I would be greatly disappointed, its pretty chessey, nbut there is one guy in it that has an amazing voice that really saved the show. the girls are good dancers, but that's all i can say about that.",1
"Great pizza! I practically lived there when I lived in Shadyside. My favorite pizza is the Shadyside special. They also offer gyros, wings, salads, calzones, wedgies, hoagies, pastas, traditional, white and gourmet pizzas. Pizza Perfectta is part of a chain of pizza shops that include Cafe Milano, Pizza Milano and Pizza Mineo's",2
"I had such high hopes for this place but it fell short in many ways. I had their fried green tomatoes and for 6, I got 4 slices of skinny green tomatoes, deep fried and over battered. Tried their fried chicken, it wsa crispy but why is the portion so small. The table cloth is grimy and sticky. Try a Waffle house and I think you'll have a better dining experience.",1
"Ran in and got myself some quick take out as I was running around tow nBacon, Egg, and Chees on a toasted onion bagel nHam, Egg, and Cheese on a toasted onion bagel The bagels were rubbery, but not as much as the egg. It is amazing what can happen at different stores in the same chain. I must say, I wasn't hungry after I was done.",1
"Really, Pittsburgh? The Primanti bros cheeseteak is the best sandwich in the world? Didn't make me very happy. The freezer burned soggy fries, bland bread, and gross hamburger patty just didn't cut it. It would be wise to skip this place. Might be worth a stop for 2.50 big beers anytime. That's a keeper.",1
"I met two buddies for dinner last week. Our server was n time and served me a fantastic dirty martini with blue cheese olives. nI was not in the mood for salads and appetizers. I ordered my filet, medium. The steak arrived, med rare. Our server seemed lost at that point so I finished my filet. It was dry. I know their steaks are dry aged but this was too dry for my taste. This was my last try.",1
"I was a solo diner, and I sat in a booth. I had to wave down the waitress to order my lunch pad thai as I had sat there for at least 10 minutes. I had to wave down the waitress to get the check. There's nothing special about the food, overly sweet, mushy, and not like any other Thai food I have had in AZ. No one said good bye and thanked for eating in the restaurant. I will never return.",1
"Didn't feel as much like a dance club as like a old men's high roller club. The girls walking around in bunny suits were mildly off putting, the pictures of girls on the wall were a little odd, but the gambling on the club floor was really what turned me off. I mean, isn't there enough gambling in Vegas? Does it really need to happen in the club too?",1
This particular store is like the lost and forgotten one. I actually forgot that this store was still here until the semiannual sale left me scouring for BBWs with larger inventory. This place had all I needed and then some! It's a larger store than the usual BBW with plenty of room to walk around and sample. The sales people were friendly and helpful too!,2
"NON SENSE, WASTE OF TIME. was here because of the good reviews. too bad i did not get what i wanted. Saw the lady massaging my husbands feet right hand on her phone left hand on the foot she's too busy on her celphone, maybe she's playing snake? lol! sorry to disturb u girl!too bad we paid upfront from yelp's deal. we paid for 1 hour but took off after 30 mins such a waste of time!",1
Be careful coming here. I had bad service here before but I wanted to give them another chance. The Service was good but what happened after made me sick. Roaches were crawling on the walls and my table. My family freaked out and left. We told the supervisor what happened. She said ok we'll take care of it. Good luck fazolis.,1
"Date Night! 45 min wait on a Fri night 7pm. We had the Old Fashion Burger and the Farfalle Chicken pasta. Both were very good would get them again. Service was not the best we've had. Cheesecake is always the highlight of this place. We had a hard time choosing Reese's PB was a little strong, Red Velvet was PERFECT!",2
"These People are horrible! Their customer service sucks, they're rude don't know how to make customers feel welcomed. Every single time we come in we have a bad experience. I don't understand why like if we should feel privileged to spend 50 on one meal with them be stingy with their crappy condiments.",1
my tan still hasn't faded a bit after almost 5 days. i didn't smell funny after like i usually would from a spray tan. she tanned my legs and face so perfectly. shannon is amazing! i would recommend her to any of my friends. i was comfortable the whole time and i cant wait to go back! no complaints here thank you shannon ,2
"Boring menu, over priced, lackluster food, brilliant decor, and boy do those giant smoking cocktails look delicious. I wasn't impressed with the menu selection, so I opted for soup. I don't even remember what kind, that's how much it didn't move me. Grandma's chicken sandwich was okay, but a little on the dry side. This place is so pretty though, I might just come back to try a smoking goblet.",1
"I don't know that I've ever been so impressed with the layout and thoroughness of a museum. I usually get dragged to them because my mom is such a fan and has to hit at least one in every town we visit, but I have to say I'm glad we visited this one. I learned a lot and got a whole new perspective on the area. Definitely recommend if you're a museum lover!",2
I was treated to a manicure at this location by a friend and it was awesome! Very clean and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. I got a classic manicure and my technician was very nice and did an excellent job grooming my nails as well as giving me a much needed hand and arm massage! Prices were great too. Would definitely go back in the future.,2
"The food and service was excellent, well deserved 5 star rating. While it was a little out of the way, I'm so happy we were turned on to it! Elements has one of the most romantic views at sunset! And a stroll around the grounds is enchanting. I highly recommend even a drink at the bar at sunset! Amazing!",2
"Eric and his team did an exceptional job on the vehicle wrap for Arizona's Dukes of Air! They paid attention to the details that we were looking for and the truck turned out so nice that we get calls from people who see it driving down the road, who simply call to tell us how awesome it looks! I will not hesitate to use Eric and his team again for my next vehicle wrap. THANK YOU",2
After 2 weeks after we return our dog nDJ re affirmed us that we were getting nOur dog back. But after numerous calls nWe are unable to contact DJ because the nnice resident of Salem Mass. Told us that We are not getting her back because she is nIn charge of fostering and our dog will be place with some one else . nV R E P why do they have this woman in such nice place? ,1
Decided to try this breakfast place. Bad idea. We always go somewhere else but they were crowded. Walked in to eggs n more and there were about 3 groups ahead of us. The restaurant was empty but they did not seat us. After waiting about 15 minutes they sat us and it took over and hour to get our food. This place needs staff and a better manager. EXCUSES! Horrible. Will not return.,1
"Food's not that great. The staff was extremely friendly service was fast. I had the Caramba chickeachos. The chicken had an odd taste to it, like it had been boiled too long didn't even have any seasoning. The chips tasted stale. Nacho cheese sauce from a can.very bland. Unfortunately we wont be repeat customers.",1
we dealt with the office off the I 215 with Celia it was awful non caring didnt follow thru lost two properties due to her lack of interest so confused it was like being with someone who had demensia I feel that Coldwell Century 21 the big names are bigger it was so unnecessary depressing find a advanced realtor who cares,1
"Mini chicken chimmies with extra guacamole and sour cream plus a frozen canyon three tequila margarita with salt. Muy Bueno on the patio in the late afternoon on a relatively cool day without the misters to soak you. In the morning I felt I had to go back to oatmeal and berries red, black and blue to counter the dairy products and alcohol from the day before. Works for me.",2
"I had the bulgogi tacos the other day at the Capital Square location. They are 3 for 7 and that's plenty even for a healthy appetite. get corn tortillas .They were freshly made and just a tremendous blend of Asian flavors. I think they put the basic Mexican taco which I love , to shame. Think I'll go back tomorrow!",2
"I love this arena.maybe I am biased since I am a diehard Suns fan and a downtown resident, but it really is a nice facility. The Suns games are always well put together.great announcer, great dancers, great entertainment, and great concessions. I attended the last game of the season in a suite Wednesday night and was impressed with the space and the food.actually quite good!",2
"If you just want a cone of ice cream, i literally can't praise luca's ice cream enough. it is of the highest quality! There is a restaurant upstairs here too which is totally cheap and cheerful mostly but i'm not such a big fan of it there. Thankfully though the ice cream is incredible, which i think is the important thing given that it's their thing.",2
"I've been there twice, this clean, professional, friendly place makes me to go over and over again. They use Chinese herbal oil once if needed, that's really release your muscle pain or tight back. If you are looking for a real massage therapy, this is the one My strong recommendation. They won't disappoint you and you will certainly feel like brand new one after it.",2
"Sooo I'm obsessed! Lol I LOVE this place! First time I got the marshmallow with graham crackers? Forgot the name! Anyways it was a little pricey but once I got my sundae, that thing was huge! Needless to say I obviously did not finish it. Second time I went I for the strawberry shortcake bombness! Can't go wrong with this place. Excellent customer service just a little packed but line goes quick",2
"This place is not what it used to be, I ordered the jade chicken which I usually get because it's my favorite and when it came out my meal looked like it had been sitting out for quite a while, I had asked for salsa to freshen it up a bit and they gave me this nasty tomato sauce. I don't understand what happened to this place even the staff looked lazy. Please fix this",1
"This is the worst pharmacy. They constantly lie to the customers. They lose Rx. They alter the time they receive Rx. When my doctor faxed refill, they lied and said that they are waiting for the doctor to approve. They fill wrong Rx. These people have no business working in a pharmacy. They are playing with people's lives.",1
Stood at the door for 15 minutes with like 3 tables unbussed. No one hustling. Now sitting at the table with enough time on my hands to write this review. Pho is usually fast since the broth should all be prepared already. Not sure when I'm going to eat yet.just finally got my water after asking for it twice. So frustrated,1
"PLEASE BE ADVISED They only have rooms with 1 King sized bed and the other bed is a Queen SOFA bed. Also, it's suppose to be quite far from the strip. out by the Palms and Luxor. I booked through Priceline and they will not refund me for an off strip room for 1. despite my parameters being the opposite.",1
"Great local cafe restaurant. I stay nearby and love going for breakfast at weekend. It's chilled and relaxed and the food is excellent. To be honest, better than you might expect for its location. I've also been in the evening and again, excellent food and service. This is gem of a local business which deserves our support!",2
"I've give it 4.5 stars if I could. More veggie options like spinach would put it over the top. Had a large pizza with pepperoni sausage tomatoes and red peppers, and a white pizza with sausage meatballs basil garlic and artichoke. Both were great but the white pizza won. Next time I may try their pesto pizza.",2
Food was ok but the service was less than exceptable. The server was eating food while holding our salads. We were not offered options for what came with the meal. There were 3 other couples in there and all were making the same comments of how slow the service was. I had to ask for every refill and we waited a long time to pay.,1
"We were walking into the restaurant as 2 customers walked out and one told us ""DON'T EVEN BOTHER. "" We didn't listen to the advice. nThe meal consists of tasteless grocery store hotdog with coleslaw, barbecue sauce and fries. The server asked if we want extra coleslaw, we found out why. nIt's because the hotdog is so tasteless you need extra coleslaw to add to the taste. nThe fries are OK.",1
"This place is really good, I eat here once or twice a week because I work in the area. Its affordable and great fresh food. Its very clean, they mop like 3 times a day and the employees are the nicest of any place I've ever been. Ask for the ""UPS special "", its a breakfast wrap with egg, turkey sausage and sliced chicken with barbeque sauce and provalone. Its the best wrap you'll ever eat.",2
"Go here for Brunch! Lunch and dinner are fine, but the breakfast menu and the E61 coffee bar cannot be beat. My usual order is a bowl of cafe au lait, and a veggie scramble. The breakfast potatoes are so good. It can get crowded, but if you're in a small group 2 you can usually skip the line and sit at the bar which is full service.",2
"Not what I expected for a downtown Hilton. Valet was terrible, executive lounge was dull, walls were thin, dishes stayed on the hallway floor for 3 days. I understand they are still under construction. On the bright side the front desk staff and bellman were very nice, our room was clean and gym did the job.",1
I would give this place zero stars if I could. The service was terrible for a football Sunday when there really wasn't that many people there. Just another overpriced bar in old town with nothing special to offer. They also overcharged for my food but we didn't feel like waiting around for it to be changed on the bill. Back to my dive bar!,1
"I love Ross and I love a bargain, but why is this particular location almost always half empty? The racks look so sad! I try to check this place out often and it's always the same half empty racks. This isn't the best Ross location in town so don't make a special trip to shop here. As with every Ross, checkout lines are ridiculously long.",1
"I ate here twice, once for lunch and for dinner. I thought the food was excellent. There was top notch pizza, a Middle Eastern section with very good tandoori chicken, lamb and even baklava for dessert. The Mexican station was closed when I visited. The food was all fresh tasting, the plates were warmed and service was good. Three thumbs up.",2
"Paid 100 bucks for a one night stay. The full sized beds were TINY. Two grown people most definitely do NOT sleep or fit comfortably! Breakfast was decent. They offer waffles, cereal, juices milk, some fruit, boiled eggs, yogurt, bagels or bread for toasting. The pool was nice as well as the pool area itself. The location is pretty centralized to a ton of restaurants, sports complex, and shopping.",1
They can't even get your steak right the way you want it. They screwed up 3 times on my steak left it red red inside and I told them that's it I don't want anything more. They tried giving me a free dessert to calm me down but it didn't work at all. I refused it. Worst thing about it was that I was starving to eat dinner. I won't be coming back here ever.,1
"Red Robin.what can I say? Despite being a chain, they really have some of the best burgers in town. Our waitress from last week was so friendly. She kept our drinks filled, brought us fries before our food was brought out, and had our check ready when asked. They have new burgers that are less expensive and make your burger, your own. Yum!",2
"This place is great and I eat here often. The food is very good and the prices are great. Took a friend and we ordered egg rolls, spring rolls, and two main courses, think it was curry chickeoodle soup and a spicy chicken over rice. The bill was under 20. A Vietnamese friend recommended this place and I have been eating here ever since!",2
"Located in The Linq on the Las Vegas Strip. This is the worlds largest observation wheel. It's in Las Vegas so they offer a happy hour as well! The views are spectacular, the whole thing takes about 45 min, it's well worth the price, it's the latest must do in Las Vegas. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",2
Great but very much like the myriad other relatively new offerings that are proliferating the Central Phoenix Camelback corridor. The recipes weren't quite as exotic or orginal as advertised but I did think that the sweet potato fries were top notch. Great spot but because there are so many great restaurants in the area it doesn't crack the lineup often.,2
This has to be the best hamburger I've had! I ate the whole thing I'm a fatty . Onion rings and sauce were awesome. Nothing compares to the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. My hubby had the regular one and nearly finished his he liked it so much. If I ever crave a burger again this is the spot in South Phoenix. One less star because the last of my onion rings was too greasy.,2
"This used to be cleaice place but now it dirty, overcrowd and management will do a quick switch and bait on their membership deals. Watch out for those hidden ""special assessments "" thats how they get you in the door and promise you its only 10 bucks a month then hit you with all these fees and changes. nI felt better taken care at s used car salesmen convention.",1
"I don't have high expectations when I stay off the strip. I do, however, expect a level of service at least sub par to what I'm paying. This hotel is a convenient 5 min drive from the strip. Other than that. am I even in Vegas? Drinks here are pricey yet weak. Elevators were extremely slow, sometimes a 5 minute wait. Rooms were clean. Beni Hana's was cool. .I've experienced better.",1
"After reading some of the previous reviews, this place is over rated. Had lunch today and ordered WOR won ton soup, Cashew Chicken, Beef Broccoli, Combo Fried Rice and the Walnut Shrimp. Really disappointed in the won ton soup.it looked good.it just didn't have any umph to it.the rest of the food was.shall I say.americanized? CJ Palace in Sparks, NV.now there's some good chinese food.",1
My wife and I stopped by here not too long ago and wanted someplace with a good ambiance to chat and read.we found it! This place was absolutely fantastic! My chai latte was great and her triple chocolate was absolutely delicious. There were only a few other people there and we enjoyed the calm! Will definitely be going back!,2
"This is the bar lounge in the Hilton Monona Terrace Hotel. Good drink specials, inexpensive and STRONG cocktails, and free appetizers during happy hour. Very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. But HORRIBLE SERVICE. We had the same slowww, forgetful, inattentive, annoying bartender for three nights in a row. Go for the drinks not the people!",1
"Um, 40 for entrance. And what do you get for your 40? Overpriced drinks, nowhere to sit and a bunch of people standing around no dancing, just standing. It's all about the brand. We got in for free as we knew someone, but I still think it was a waste of time. I'd rather spend my 40 at Rain, or elsewhere.",1
"Yelp says that two stars is ""Meh. I've experienced better. "" But, I really haven't. I'm a newbie to manicures I think I do my owails pretty well so I usually take care of them. I'm not well versed iail salons, but, I don't think a professional manicure is supposed to have air bubbles in the nail polish, like mine does.",1
"I suppose if they show up they do a good job. Unfortunately I will never find out. Scheduled an appointment on a Tuesday for Thursday and they never showed up. No call, no apology, no reschedule. I see that most of the positive reviews are for window replacement, maybe that is the ultimate level of work they are capable of. Like I said I will never know.",1
"Of course I love Goodwill! This new location is very well laid out and most importantly STILL CLEAN! nThe selection is average for a Goodwill Store with with same specials and pricing as other locations. The racks are packed with great items Most importantly, the staff is is VERY helpful and courteous. This is my new fav Goodwill in Vegas",2
"Such a breathtaking, romantic view. The best view of the strip! Come here with a date, not a bunch of wild friends wanting to party. Dancing is strictly prohibited.I'm guessing because there's a glass floor and dancing jumping on it could potentially break it. I got in free but my date paid a 25 cover.",2
"I only had their ribs, beans, and potato salad but I am not sure if I would go back to sample their other stuff. The ribs were horrible no taste what so ever. The beans looks like soup until I dug my fork in them and the potato salad tasted like it came out of a container from Fry's. The place was clean, and employees were friendly but that isn't enough for me.",1
" 18.95 per person.Was really hungry for lunch and didn't want to leave the hotel mid day in Vegas. Not worth it! Furr's cafeteria or hometown buffet is actually better than this place.REALLY! Don't eat here! Their ""chinese food line was mostly salt the prime rib is tougher than the sole of my shoe. You'd probably enjoy fastfood better in this instance.",1
"After reading the reviews and the amount of stars it had I was excited to try it. I was pretty disappointed. The menu didn't seem to have much it kinda felt stumped on a few entrees. The service was slow and it wasn't even busy. We went on a Sunday afternoon it was not busy at all, yet the service very slow",1
"Great fresh food at a fair price is hard to say no to. I had the ravioli and chocolate cake. The ravioli and marinara was fresh, not over seasoned, made in house and hands down the best I've ever had. Same with cake, fresh, homemade, and rich. Only issue I have is the wine list, but not really an issue sense it's not a high end place. I'll be going back here soon.",2
"For a ""4 star "" resort this place sucks. Rooms sucked. Casino floor sucks. Resort fees suck. Sugar sucks.the food was awful! And those big 35 drinks that have ""8 to 10 "" shots.sucked. The 8 to n10 includes liqueurs.boo! Shame on Paris for charging hefty prices and failing miserably when it comes to quality and entertainment.",1
"Polly's Mom opinions n ""The Calamari Squid are too salty. "" n ""The Lobster are extreme too salty. "" n ""The Service are bad supportive. "" Polly's opinions n ""I am agreed with my mother, but service should said, hi, how are you my is Rudy and I'm going to be your server today nAnd besides, my mom don't know who is our server support our table. """,1
"I got a free room here, and didnt want to stay here so i packed my shit and went elsewhere. Seriously, Paris sucks. The cafe sucks, the buffet sucks, and the rooms suck. What sucks even more? The people who gamble here. Lets just say the bottom of the barrel are seen at the Paris. Like, when IP is booked, they come to Paris. Bad luck, bad scene",1
"Cheap. Delicious. Cali Mexican. There Cajun chicken is to die for. This is always a fun spot that a bunch of friends end up at after hanging out at the bars in the area. The staff here seem really cleanly and friendly. They have a discount for all bar, casino and restaurant employees with valid proof from 9pm 8am! Love the locals discount portion.",2
"I can't really say anything bad about this location at all. They provide great customer service, place is clean and organized and the produce is fresh. They have some really good deals sometimes! This week they have rockstars for 0.79 per can for every ten that you buy. That is a great deal. It seems to always be a really busy place.",2
Omg! Jacob is amazing. He gave me some great advice on an old piercing that has given some irritation over the years. I was trying to get it repierced instead he gave me something practical to try. He is very professional and quite knowledgeable about the way the body works! I will be back to get my jewelry from here.,2
"Love this little place. Alicia has cut my hair three times now, and does a fantastic job. She takes her time and really pays close attention to every hair! I have a super short pixie cut, so it could definitely be done badly, but I have been very satisfied every time I've gotten a trim here. The price is pretty average for most salons I've been to.",2
"They've set the bar so high for pizza, it's hard to go anywhere else. I get cravings often for it! Yum! Can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Management is constantly striving for excellence. You can see it in their work ethic, always on the floor helping cleaning and talking to their customers. Good work!",2
"This place is great! A surprise spot in my neck of the woods I was unaware of. I'm a native to the east valley, so having Mexican food I can enjoy outside of my extended family's cooking is difficult. I can't give it 5 stars because the service didn't blow my socks off, but the food is outstanding. You have to ask for their hot green sauce, it will burn you. ",2
I've always loved this place and I'm trying to make an effort to go out of my way more to go here because it is leaps and bounds better than any chain coffee shop around. The service is always excellent and the employees seem genuinely happy to be there. Thank you to the car in front of me at the drive through this morning who paid for my wonderful Iced Soy Salted Caramel Latte!,2
"I still love this place. Got a chance and was in the area the other day. Nazy did another great job and I gave her plenty to work with in my negligence. She is so friendly and actually remembered me from last time. My friend was with me but chickened out, so now she shall be known as the one with the furry brows because mine are gorgeously human again. I wish the shop was closer!",2
"LOVE this place. The staff was extremely friendly, the spa is clean and beautiful. nI go to an Aveda salon at home, and I trust that they have high standards. I had an aqua polish 75 and worth every penny! A bit tricky to find, but that's only because the roads iorth vegas are tricky, turning corners and changing names when you don't expect them too. nReally, this was a great experience!",2
"Chopstix has a full menu of chinese and japanese goodies, including sushi. They also have really low prices. Alas, maybe it was too good to be true. While my sweet and sour chicken was standard, the sushi I ordered was quite awful. It was not fresh by a long shot. It was a good deal, but the sushi was a major let down.",1
"We used to eat here quite a bit, but the quality has gone down. The chicken was always moist and fresh, but the last five or so times it has been dried out and flavorless. We usually order 'to go', but the last time we ate in I was surprised by the lack of cleanliness. I'd like to see them clean up and learn to serve chicken safely without it tasting like saw dust.",1
"Nice big room! kinda a crappy view of the ph tower. We could kinda see the pool . no strip. but whatever! we were up on the 21st floor . did I say huge room! cause it was! and we had the cheapest package available through an allegiant air package. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, and will certainly stay again!",2
"A nice place. A little hidden, but worth the search. The service is excellent from the moment you walk in. Try the watermelon salad to start. I am not fond of watermelon and I enjoyed it. The pork and swordfish are amazing. The custard desert wasn't great, but the chocolate cake was tasty. Also a nice bar. The wine list was a little on the light side, but they had a decent selection.",2
"Who knew that at 3 00 AM in the morning that it would take them 20 minutes to make some ""FAST "" food?! The manager did little to hide the fact that he was being purposely rude and slow. Not only that, prices have seriously increased since I had McDonald's in high school and this really did not make it even the slightest better. Holy shit, I'm so over this place. Forever.",1
"I moved away from Phoenix over a year ago. When I came back to visit recently the only restaurant that I HAD to go to was Postino's. As always, there was excellent service, great wine selection, and the bruschetta is simply to die for and affordable ! You know a place is good when you regularly crave it from 2,000 miles away!",2
"horrable place! They were so rude that we walked out. They completely ignored us when we walked in, didn't even say hi or anything. The employees continued to sit around and talk while we were standing there. They couldn't even answer their phone because they were too lazy to get up and do something. If I could rate this negitive 20 I would!",1
"Weak. This place is a far cry from the Mill Ave. location in Tempe. Gone now. Long Wong's quality is lost on this place. I had pizza and wings and my slice was literally microwaved to heat it up after I ordered. Bad, bad, bad. Wings have always been decent, but there's really no reason to go there ever again.",1
"THE place to be on Badger game day in Madison! The campus sports bar has the usual beers and hoardes of drunken fans. Always a good time.except the time that guy started randomly video taping me and my girlfriends.yeah, that was weird.but still, a definite staple in any college student's bar scene. 4 stars.",2
"It appears to be better than Ooka Hibachi from what I experienced. The service is still not up to Japanese standards, but better than it was before. The food is really good! If you love teppanyaki you will enjoy eating here. The prices are expensive, but teppanyaki is never cheap. I enjoyed my experience and would return. This place definitely beats out Ah So.",2
"hmmm. what can I say? it was definitely tasty. atmosphere takes the stars down. I expected a little more swank and a little less shorts and frat crowd. that's all I can say. nLocation was in the MALL had I realized this, I would not have made the reservation. Service was pretty good, and food was as expected. I won't rush back to this place.",1
"We came by for dinner and from the beginning, the front host was rude and did not sit us the area we want it. Then waiters took a long time to even ask us what drinks we wanted., maybe because the basketball game was on! Some of food was cold and other very salty, drinks very expensive for the side and service was terrible. Overall, below average since place look semi clean.",1
"This is a great theater and the Cine Capri is really great. The service is friendly and the popcorn is good. If your a loyal Harkins movie goer you gotta get the souvenir cup and shirt. It's just a great bargain. The only problem with this theater is it's extremely popular and the movies sell out fast, even with the Cine Capri. Just plan ahead and show up early and you'll be fine.",2
"First time reviewer. Pinky's food is very good. I am LONG time ""waddling bird "" customer and I have to say, Pinky's food is even better. Now, I did NOT get a burger here. Instead I got the fried pickles, white bean humus and a chicken spinach salad my creation and they all 3 were very good. I AM impressed. Good job y'all!",2
I use to frequent this place on my lunch hour. The last time I went there to grab a quick lunch we were sitting in the booth talking and waiting for the waitress to bring us our order when the person across from me pointed out that there was a roach crawling up the booth next to the wall. I composed myself and used my napkin to squish it. Haven't been back since.,1
Stayed here twice now. I can truthfully say there won't be a third. There are better places to stay and play on the strip than Luxor. The Inclinators will make you throw up! Allbeit the rooms were clean. But the casino floor will have you running around in circles trying to get back to your room. And who's tired of the timeshare salespeople lurking in the hallway?! I'm sick of them!,1
I've been here many times and never really had to write a review . its a gas station and workers usually OK. But today on easter Sunday came to get gas and a carwash . I mistakenly hit no on carwash button . I asked if there was anyway I can get the discount for gas . The girl was rude and Said I can sell you a wash . Unbelievable. I hate useless employees.,1
"I was not pleased with Wynn Buffet, for 38.00 per person it really was a let down. I was not happy that the food selection and my guests were surprised also. The food was pizza, and prime rib, nothing specular. We went to Wynn thinking it was going to be the best. Sorry Steve, I was let down on this experience.",1
This is my go to place for breakfast. Everything I've ever had is delicious. I take all my out of town friends here for breakfast or lunch and there has beeothing but raves from everyone. They want to come back to visit just so we can go eat at Crackers. Lunch is just as good as breakfast. I've never been disappointed. Service is very good as well. Highly recommend this place.,2
"I have been to Centro over the last 3 or 4 months, at least 8 times. Each time I come away thinking I will not be back soon enough. Casey and his good friends make you feel like an old friend. All well heeled in the wine area and with the delicious Panini's, what is not to love. Excellent music too! nIt is as good as it gets for a small comfortable neighborhood hang out. Period.",2
"Great patio area with TVs and fireplace, but service is terrible. There was a dirty plate and glass left on table next to is for over an hour as other sat on the couches. People were complaining all around us. On Saturday night they had some sit com on instead of a football game. Left without eating dinner due to poor service.",1
Solid local independent pizza place. They are generally friendly but a little abrupt at times. I've eaten there plenty of times and I've always been satisfied with the product. The prices are fair for the quality of the ingredients. I've never been disappointed except when Tony wasn't cooking the pizza recently.,2
"No one greeted me. nTook a few minutes to be asked for something to drink. When my food was served I asked for a side of salsa. I waited 30 minutes, never even being checked in on once during that time . Finally I interrupted a waiter to ask for it again. By that time my food as cold. I've been waiting for another 30 min just pay my bill. nFood was good nWaitress tried. But c'mon!",1
"Starwood platinum member with 30 stays in last six months. Left early for event and told front desk that toilet not working and asked that it be fixed upon return. Upon return, toilet not remedied. Called front desk and instead of fixing issue threatened to be thrown out of hotel. By far, worst hotel experience of all time.",1
I feel lucky to be able to work out at the Village. The yoga instructors are my favorite part about it all or most of them are from At One Yoga. The equipment is state of the art the facilities are very nice. Plus it has one of the best views in town of Camelback Mtn from the back patio tennis courts!,2
This place was pretty good. I had never been to one of these Franchise . But its setup pretty cool. You pick a serving size. type of noodle and protein to add and they cook and serve. The prices weren't bad at all either. There were a lot of people ordering the Wisconsin mac and cheese I may have to try that the next time. Id definitely go back.,2
"awful, people hand out here all hours of the night, panhandling and everyone smokes outside of front doors and side doors. nno one does anything, i reported this over and over, now it is being reported to the state. also, no one gets the orders right nand hardly anyone is at the counters, and no one speaks english.",1
"The pasta at this place is right for its price. I forget the exact name of the dish I ordered, but it was a spicy red sauce penne pasta on their regular menu. It definitely had a kick and it could use more vegetables, but I was more concerned with carbo loading at the time. For a bring your own wine restaurant and food available at their more than reasonable prices, I'd come back.",2
Huh? Create your own cupcake. Maybe my three dogs should plan our weekly food shopping. Why not just have a bunch of good cupcakes? Silly toppings are cute for kids but c'mon. Maybe we can go build a bear afterward. At 3 a throw for a minature cupcake that is at best decent? Go here after you drop 25 for a lollipop at Sugar Factory and it will be a bargain. Any supermarket can top these.,1
"This is the 3rd time at Toast and I can definitely say I won't be going back. Here is the lowdown on my thoughts Service 2 stars nBloody Mary 1 star mix is awful nChicken wrap 4stars. Lots of chicken in that wrap, had service been better to have sauces it would have been much better Others breakfast were rated around 2 3 stars. We were w a group of 6 Wouldn't go back, so many other great places",1
I come to the XYZ bar on occasion to catch the local talent singing. On Thursday nights they offer half price glasses or bottles of wine. Who could resist? Great place on a warm night since they also have a nice outdoor seating area. I've had a few of their apps and they are very good as well. No complaints!,2
"I am giving them a follow up ONE star 0 stars if I could I sent my review and a print out of all the Yelp reviews to their corporate marketing via snail mail. I asked for a response, especially in response to my experience. Never got one. Your Customer Loyalty and F B managers are doing a terrible job.",1
Best Thai food I've ever had and I live near San Francisco so have had some great Thai. The atmosphere is very casual which I actually like . The menu and fine wine list are extensive. I recommend the garlic shrimp and salad with steak. We went back a second time the weekend of our visit. Great place!,2
I bought my boyfriend a Living Social coupon for a shave and he came home looking like his face got into a fight with a feral cat. It was truly alarming. I have never seen worse razor burn in my life. His face was covered in scabs for two weeks. I don't know if that particular barber was dipping into the stores but perhaps booze and sharp objects is just a bad idea.,1
"We went in quite late on a quite night, the server seemed distant to our table, my friends really enjoyed the steak, my chipotle chicken was tasty but dry. It took our server forever to bring our drinks, never bothered to come around ask for refills. I had to walk to the bar to order a second drink whilst our server was chatting to a table right next to us! I will not visit this place again",1
"very good sushi over at Ra on Mill. The food is why i went and that is what i am basically rating right now. Sat at the bar, it was a nice evening all in all. But the service was a strong C . I really hope they improve over time because they would pull better ratings io time. I will not give up just yet. i will go back there in a while to give them another chance. Have fun be safe and good luck.",2
"The food and drinks were fine, pizza was really good. Our server seemed a little flighty. I ask to see the drink menu because I wanted a mixed drink. She handed me the list then walked away. She may have been giving me time to look it over but a little communication that she would be right back would have beeice. Tons of TV but audio for only one game.",2
"Horrendous. It is near my house so I stop in ever once in a while and every time and I tell myself it is the last time. The place is a mess all of the time, the shoppers are rude and let their kids run all over the store. Some of the staff seem a little nicer than they used to be. If I could find some good deals I might keep going back, but TJ Maxx's is getting all of my .",1
"Great place for your monogramming needs or gifts for people that you just don't know that well! Tons of variety with imported China made cute items for your monogramming needs. Quick turn around, lots of options on fonts colors patterns. They will monogram items that you bring in not purchased from them as well so no need to settle on their quality which is not great on some items !",2
Had a great time here though I did go on a Friday and it was busy but still had no problem getting drinks or having fun. Four square jenga giant beer pong darts and corn hole with friends while drinking what is not to love. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is it used to be a hidden gem now everyone goes there.,2
"They have the best salad ever! The name is Thai High Sweet Zesty Chicken Salad. It is seriously the best salad I've ever eaten. I crave it daily! And it's huge so if you go there for lunch you can easily split it. They also have a good kids menu and a nice atmosphere. But really, don't miss out on that salad!",2
"I will never order from this place again! We got the menu on our door, and thought we would try a new place. I wish I would have checked YELP before ordering. After ordering they gave us our total and it was double what the menu said. They said the menu was printed wrong. So I tried it any way, it was the worst pizza I have ever had, but the wings were good.",1
We just moved to the area and were looking for a good place to work out. We decided to try the rec center and got a 1 week trial period. We worked out at different times during the day and were always able to get a treadmill or elliptical. I love that the classes are included in the month to month membership no contracts too!,2
" Long taxi lines nobody likes to wait n No where to charge your phone I mean, I did see one charging station, with four plugs four plugs for the millions of travelers that pass through n Spotty Wifi enough said. n Too many annoying casino games that are way too loud especially when your trying to fly home and have had enough of the casino! nOnly good thing. tons of food options.",1
"I suck at bowling, but to get to here I wasn't crazy from Angela was so worth the four gutters I got in a row. I got to meet a lot of new and cool people, and some that I had been waiting a while to actually meet! Everyone was so cool and fun even when it got to 2 am and a pimp starting handing out twenties. Now that I will never forget.",2
worst service ever. I went in for a quick fill the guys said 20 mins so i waited. then a pedicure walks in for 2 people and all of a sudden the lady that was suppose to do my nails next goes to do the pedi. They dont serve you first come first served and they wasted my time. never going back and im glad i didnt spend any of my money for their poor customer service.,1
"Had date night last night with the Mrs. Every dish was fantastic. Started with the deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes and guacamole. The guac was awesome. Wife PV salad, good as always. I had a special suckling pig and a side of wild rice and cauliflower. Wow. Ended with the bananas foster beignets. Thanks to Beth and her great staff for a wonderful night out!",2
"If you show your local ID and your players card free to get , the drinks are 50 off. Good place to catch up with friends. They have go go dancers, which is entertaining. I'm mostly entertained by the music videos they play on their tv screens throughout the bar. The whole place is a circle, but it's never hard to find seating.",2
"This place is spectacular. It's as family owned and operated as you get. They take pride in their food and they love compliments. To me, this is comfort food. The sweet potatoes and collard greens are worth a try. The cakes are addicting. the chicken. well, don't get me started on the chicken, just look at the stars I rated them.",2
"What a hidden gem! nService was fantastic. We sat on the patio and it was wonderful. We had an amazing DealChicken deal that got us 1 bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. Not too shabby. Everything was delicious. My girlfriend and I had no idea this place existed, and wouldn't have visited if it didn't have such good reviews on Yelp. We are sure glad we went here!",2
This place is the shizznit on Sundays ! I have been going every Sunday recently and always have a great time! nThe cocktails are fun and tasty and 20 off on Sundays.! nOn Sundays they have DJ's mixing some awesome chilled deep house beats which is always a treat. Monday mornings just don't agree with me at all.,2
What a wonderful place. My son took me here after a bad experience at another antique mall. It was great! We looked for several hours. The employees were very helpful and friendly. There were so many items to look at and such a wide variety. We were both able to get items. The prices were very reasonable. It is absolutely a place that we will be going back to.,2
" yawn mediocre pizza, service is okay some days , other days you can tell someone can't wait to go home. . I Only order here when I'm broke. n The drivers are usually cool the reason for 2 stars , but the store personnel, could use some motivation. . Management needs to step their game up! Trickle effect lived in this jurisdiction 3 years and it's the same ole same ole every time.",1
" 6.95 for sandwich or salad or 1 2 sanwich and soup salad combo! nTortellini Florentine soup was tasty, plenty of tortellini, flavorful. nChicken twist was excellent healthy chicken salad. This reminded me of sandwich bars in London, with better food, fresh ingredients, and reasonable prices. I would give it 4.5 stars if I had that option! Responsible organic food, reasonable prices. Must try!",2
Went to Customshop for anniversary dinner last night. We were not disappointed! Our server was very attentive and answered all our questions. The recommended wine was great and she served a generous pour. I had the pork chop which was awesome and my husband raved about the ribeye. We will definitely go back.,2
"Hands down the best brazilian wax I've gotten was at BOX, and I'm not na u00efve! Decor is amazing, she was quick and as painless as could be, and she even waxed a few extra places compared to other salons but didn't charge any different. I would recommend this place before any others, and am glad to see such a real, luxurious salon in LV.",2
Worst experience ever! Waiter dropped off food and never came back! Didn't care if we needed anything. And other waiters waitresses were waiting on other tables and not one came over to us. The chicken Alfredo was nasty. Sauce tastes old and left over. 8oz steak was more like a 3 oz steak. And a waitress was fighting with the cook. Very unprofessional.,1
The pho is alright. Seems like if you ask for a large they just give you more soup. Bad service. I had asked for a refill the waiter cleaned two tables right in front of me still didn't get me a refill. Asked again cleaned three more tables yet still didn't get me a refill. Ended up asking another waiter for a refill.,1
"It's still hot. They now have table service, and it is terrible. It seems like morale is really low at this place. The hosts and waitstaff look like they all can't wait to leave, and that shines thru while they're ""helping "" you. If you are looking for great Mexican food, take a trip 8 miles south and go to the Original La Canasta.",1
"Nowhere to park, little room to sit and the staff is cold. This place is worse than the DMV! Oh, and they require a payment before they even see you. I went in just because I needed a referral to see a chiropractor and I had to convince the doctor that chiropractors help people, I could tell this doctor saw them as little more than snake oil salesmen.",1
"charlestons is one of the few chains i actually enjoy. I love their croissants and their staff is always awesome. their chicken strips are awesome. i love their grilled chicken and veggies, too. They have an awesome blackened grilled chicken, they don't use oil to cook either which is a plus! they no longer have it on the menu but have never given me a problem ordering it! yay for charlestons!",2
"food was 7 10, however the service was absolutely atrocious. the place is understaffed and nobody took our order or even offered to get us drinks for 15 minutes. the couple sitting next to us had been waiting even longer. this is such a shame for a restaurant to be held back its service, of all things.",1
"This place really does it right. They have a small but focused menu, and the food is pretty basic burgers, wings, pizza, and a few sides. But you can tell that they do everything from scratch and the quality is outstanding. I dare say the burger is better than Fatheads right down the street also a great burger . Highly recommended!",2
"Very disappointed, this was my red meat day! My steak was incorrectly cooked 3 times, all the proper apologies were extended and I was not charged, but how can a steakhouse not be able to make a medium rare steak? There are lots of options in Vegas, and now after many years eating at the Palm, I will explore those options.",1
"i love the food here!very expensive,the service is very slow,only one food server,i really dont like to wait around for 40 minutes for food when i work all day without lunch plus i have to pay a food that expensive!not worth of my time,lots of restaurant out there folks who will care for good customer service!",1
"Love this place! I wish we can get some Cracker Barrels in Cali! had the Mama's french toast meal. so Delicious! I thinks my only complaint would be the sausage patties, I get the size for the kids meals but for an adult meal? Anyway, can't go to Az without a stop at good 'ol Cracker Barrel, will definately be back next time I'm in town!",2
Brought in A tire to get replace not even to have them put the tire back on the car in at 1 43 right now it's 4 12pm! And they are just now getting us a new tire! Just so we can put the tire back on ourselves! For ONE tire! Come on man. I would give it no starts but yelp won't let me. Maybe we would've been better off taking our ONE tire to discount tires for faster service!,1
"Solid menu, but the food is pretty typical mediocre. Way better places to eat in the Palazzo and Venetian. It doesn't totally suck if this is your only option for getting a table without a huge wait, it certainly is edible and the service is passable. But that is a pretty low bar to clear, particularly when compared to the offerings of its in house competition.",1
"Took my puppy here after seeing the great reviews. Unfortunately the dog groomer Bo, had cut my dogs eye then argued with saying that I brought my dog in this way. I now have to put three different types of medicated drops in my dogs eyes because of a mistake he made. We have yet to hear from the owner abut the situation.",1
"Food was great, service was very good. My only qualm was the wine. We ordered a nice bottle of Argentinian red which was 65. We really liked it so I noted the vintage, and looked it up afterwards only to find out that it retails for about 15 a bottle. I found the 400 mark up a little off putting. nI'd still go back, but would really appreciate not being gouged on the wine.",2
"Worst Thai food and very rude staff. This place blows after wait of 40 min just to be seated my expectations were very high. However, the servers are rude and take for ever to even bring out food and the price of the food does not meet the quality of the food. High prices for nasty take out food. Don't waist your time or your money. Their are several places do eat out rather than this place.",1
I hear you Tiffany!. I have a very bad experience with this type of fly by night company. I spent thousands of money for the service that is not even available for you and doesn't work. And the owner will tell you all kinds of excuse why it is not working after 10 session. One last excuse was you dont drink water. Lame!. All this is was a big scam.,1
One star for the fish bowl drink. One star for the upscale ambiance. No more stars. Happy hour is 4 until 730. But it still likely take you that long to get your food. Waited 40 minutes for a single roll. By the time it was delivered post manager intervention it was too late to order any more happy hour items. Wouldn't come back. In fact we're going back to Teharu down the street now!,1
"This is a great place to meet up with friends over some good food and drinks. Have never had a bad experience here good staff, great happy hour and I really like the atmosphere of it all. I've come here for their NYE party before as well and had an absolute blast. Definitely worth a stop in if you haven't been yet!",2
"I am really surprised by some of the lower ratings I received about the Crepe Cellar. I think the restaurant is wonderful. They tend to always have great new dinner specials and the everyday menu has an array of different options that are all great. Yes, the location is extremely small and it is usually packed tightly on weekend nights but the location also gives the place its character.",2
"This is a wonderful experience. You get to see the real city of Edinburgh, which is underneath the current city of Edinburgh. It's not often you get to see an underground city. I had the impression that there were many competing tours for the underground city. I don't know how this one compares to the rest.",2
"Nice motel. Easy on and off freeway. Clean and new or refurbished who knows? . Big room. nice furnishings. Front desk exceptionally helpful and informative and oh so pleasant and polite. Yes it was over 108 in Phoenix that day. Yes the AC worked fine. We were happy, slept well and off to the next stop on our journey across the southwest.",2
So I really like the room but . The bathroom door is broken. The floor boards are ripped off. The WiFi isn't working and I had to spend 20 minutes on the phone with the hospitality line.so much for paying the 20 resort fee. Pool closes at 6pm. 0 . Its the little things that add up And ruin the experience. Oh and the front desk and concierge are rude and have no personality at all.,1
"Amazing view! I'm not sure that I would have paid to come up here, but considering I stayed at this hotel it was free yay perks! . It's definitely worth it if its your first time in vegas and you want some amazing photos of the area. I do want to go back and try out some of the rides, although I may be to chicken. Good thing theres a bar inside!",2
"This is a place to avoid. I hardly ever say this and it pains me to say it but it's true. All the staff may be Italian but it is the worse Italian food I've ever had anywhere! I've eaten Italian food in New York, California and Italy and this was by far the worse. The streak and mushrooms that I ordered were drenched in grease and lacked taste. To add insult to injury it is overpriced.",1
"Initially I didn't go here because they do not dry clean comforters for some reason. But, I ended up going to do laundry and it was great. I have 1 washer and 1 dryer in my complex but I still prefer to make the drive here. I can get 3 loads of laundry done in about an hour and a half. They have a coin machine for change which is really great because I never have quarters on me.",2
"More interested in money than your teeth,. Always pushing unneeded cosmetic procedures I'm 50, i dont need braces! . Horrible customer service. Billing practices are irregular, confusing and they are unable to explain why we paid so much more than the estimate. They never returned any of my calls for explanation. we are getting a new dentist!",1
I took my 3 yr old here last week. Dr. Ellis and his staff were great. It was his first time to the dentist and they made him feel very comfortable and at home. They knew he loves trains and made sure to have a train on the door of the exam room. Will definitely come back here. Very clean and modern design with a game room and separate movie area for the kids.,2
"Wait was about an hour long for a group of people nHostess main girl with the tattoos was impatient, the other girls were nice nAll the waiters were big buff guys for you single ladies or in my case for my old lady nI got the hells kitchen burger it was good ngot fries it was good njalapenos poppers were also good 2 people be around 40 bucks for burgers design as cool with the fire and stuff",2
"They carry POG juice! A Hawai'i favorite nThe atmosphere is pleasant and the food really is fresh and easy. The pork ribs are great especially when on sale for 3.99 and I love how they have all the extras in a ready container ex lettuce, tomatoes and onions in a container ready for hamburgers I love this place!",2
"GREAT Patio! Fantastic atmosphere! Daily specials. my favorite? Thursday's 1 2 priced liquor drinks AND appetizers! Heck to the yes! I enjoy sitting outside on the vast patio in the comfy furniture or hanging out at the cozy bar. The food is good all I've ever eaten were the appetizers, and they're fantastic!",2
This rental car agency in Charlotte is a joke. We arrive in Charlotte and wait in the rental car island to be picked up for an hour and 45 minutes. Then we find out we are supposed to wait in a different area and wait for a bus that says Pre Flight. Like we were suppose to know this. Find a different rental car agency.,1
"Used to love this place with the good food and amazing views but the service truly sucks now. We waited nearly 30 minutes before I finally flagged a waitress down to find out who our server was she simply sneered and said ""well it's not me honey! "" That was enough for us to leave and never return. Too bad, I kind of miss the place.",1
"OK food at best. The bread is the only good part of anything. 7 dollar peanut butter and jelly? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? The only reason that I would ever go to My Florist Cafe is because my parents enjoy going. If you enjoy good piano music, there is an excellent pianist who plays there every so often. So much potential, so little of it realized.",1
This USED to be our families go to place! There was 1 other patient in the lobby. My child waited 1 hour in the lobby. The girl working the computer was very slow! The service here has plummeted! Doctors and healthcare are horrible ievada and now include this place as one of the worst. Find somewhere else,1
Rip off they suck ! My nails aren't even the right shape some are bigger then the other don't let the fool you if you ask for your nails a little narrow but still square at the end they'll tell you it's 5 DALLORS more ? FOR WHAT ITS STILL SQUARE I JUST WANTED IT NOT SO WIDE . They suck you'll find cheaper and way better,1
"RIDICULOUS wait. 3 people in lobby and 2 hours have already elapsed. I suspect there's no doctor onsite and rather than telling us, just let us sit here. I advise another urgent care. nLike others in here mentioned, they seem to disregard HIPPA laws as I am keenly aware of what everyone is in here for. Privacy? What's that?!?",1
"Yeah not coming back here for a while. The coaster was ok it was a little rough and I blacked out for half a second during the loops. From the looks of it, all the games seemed pretty lame not fun just funny looking. I do like how big the place is and how there are plenty of places to explore. Adventuredome is ghetto.straight up.",1
"They do not sterilize the tools between customer uses. The technician lied to me when I asked ""Did you sterilize that? "" He said yes, then I watched him 're sterilize' right in front of me. He cut my cuticles so low they started bleeding. If you go to this place you're going to get an infectious disease.",1
"I really do not like anything about this place. The inside of the building is depressing with horrible little tables and chairs. I do not even remember the folks working there so they must have been ok as they did not doing anything wrong. The food to me tastes like it comes out of a TV dinner, yet folks eat here and it stays open year after year so someone likes it.",1
This place gets really busy. The check out line gets really long as well. Expect a lot of walking especially of you wanna browse the whole farm. It is suggested to bring a pull cart or sturdy tote bags to carry your harvest. Otherwise they sell some cloth totes for 2 or get free plastic bags. They also sell some homemade products like peanut butter and apple cider. It's a really fun experience.,2
"Had an absolutely fantastic experience here. Got dragged along with a friend and decided to get an adjustment myself! The doctor was extremely professional, and I left feeling amazing! The office staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the establishment was very clean! Will be calling in a few minutes to make another appointment to keep my back feeling great! Highly recommend going here.",2
"Meh. Friday night at 7 00. They were busy. That makes sense. Would've made more sense to have more experienced staff working they night. I was brought the wrong drink, my Del Rio combo was over salted to a near inedible degree. I'll give two stars because my girl liked her tacos and my server tried hard, and what could I possibly expect from a giant chain restaurant.",1
"This was my first time in a Scottish Chippy, and this was great. Taking a glance at their menu they had a huge menu with a variety of cuisines haggis, fish, pizza, spring rolls, kebabs. and if you are looking for something deep fried it is likely that they have it. Service was friendly and fast, prices were very reasonable.",2
"I am a Canadian and absolutely love hockey games. The Wranglers games are no NHL but still heaps of fun. The tickets are cheap, you can drink beer and snack on arena food, the kids are super cute to watch dancing and cheering for their team and the overall ambiance is awesome. nGet a bunch of friends together and head to the Orleans arena to watch a game. You won't regret it. ",2
"Brisket was ok in flavor but was not tender. The beans I believe were canned, mac cheese tasted microwaved, cold salads seemed out of a container. Nothing seemed from scratch. The staff was very friendly but not open for opinions. I think they have potential. I would like to see the food made from scratch and it would be nice if they served bread with your meal.",1
"Not very impressed by this place. I go to thrift stores primarily for three things records, stupid knick knacks, and t shirts, and this place didn't deliver on any of these. The best thing I found was a Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer vinyl in decent shape. How is a person supposed to maintain their beardo hipster lifestyle if the salvation army isn't around to act as a lifeline of supplies?",1
If you are young and hot Miguel will move you to the front of line maybe even skip you a few more times just because he doesn't like the way you look. I ended my service after 12 years of being a loyal customer. This was not the only reason! Just where I finally realized Verizon really does not appreciate its customers.,1
"Quick, delicious and authentic Coffee and Crepe Shop. We ordered a regular cup of coffee. large fresh squeezed orange juice, a butter and sea salt crepe, a cinnamon and butter crepe and the ham and gouda crepe. Everything was hot and delicious. If you live in Madison, you should make this a regular stop. We will be back to visit.",2
"We tried Grassroots for the first time tonight and loved it! My wife went all vegetarian with a portobello sandwich and a side farmers vegetable chop. I didn't think I'd like either, but now I want to come back and get those for myself. I had the shrimp po boy. It to was delicious. We sat out on the patio which had nice ambiance. Can't wait to try other menu items!",2
"Pricey but amazing. Everything I've ever had there is top notch. And when you're there for brunch, you get bottomless MUFFINS! And they're amazing muffins. Try the pupusa if they still have it on the menu I think the menu changes a lot . This place TROUNCES Radio Maria. Trounces. I can't believe more people don't go here. I suppose it may be due to its location, which is a bit lonely.",2
The course is actually fun to play in the Summer but not worth the price in the winter. Pace of play in the winter is somewhere along the rate of reading and finishing a George R.R. Martin book also! The 1 star rating is for their refusal to allow non guests to pay to use their driving range. Really?! Who do you think supports this joint in the Summer!,1
"The Stone Crab was very good. I believe I had maybe 5 claws and days later, I want more. Anyways, I ended up with a steak which was very good and juicy. Environment was really great and the waiter was funny and had really good suggestions. Will definitely eat here again and if you've never had Crab before, try the Stone Crab Claws and you'll be very satisfied",2
"After being on hold for 10 minutes trying to place an order for pick up the employee just hung up the phone so I walk in and tell her I was the one she just hung up on and she said ""sorry we are busy "" and rolled her eyes. I turn around and their is one customer in the restaurant. Won't be going back",1
The food was amazing and the service was very nice. They accommodated me and I did not have a reservation. The place is small do it was full for a Tuesday. Chicken saltimboca with veggies. The cook came out and told me she will make anything I want even if is not in the menu. Will definitely come back.,2
"OMG! The stuffed cookies. makes you want to cry in shame because you know you have to eat the whole thing. I also tried the Bourbon Chocolate cupcake and was very impressed with the flavor. Cake was moist, frosting just right, and the bits in the cake made for a moist and chewy texture. I will be back n!",2
I joined the club and wanted to enroll with a personal trainer. The manager Neemo was so uncommunicative. When we did speak he acted like I was bothering him and very condescending. Christine was no help either. nFinally I connected with Corey and Lindsay and I am now a happy customer. Thanks Corey and Lindsay. Daisy.,1
"Eh, the pizza is just okay. Its way too over rated for what it really is and way too over priced. Also, the place is very small making it very uncomfortable. The waiters seem to rush you because they have a line at the door. I will definitely not be returning In all honesty, I think the Humble Pie is just as good or better for a more reasonable price and better environment.",1
We have been Pan China diners since they opened and the food has always been great but lately I have to say stay away from the egg rolls! A good egg roll is a wonderful thing but it seems they are using some frozen cardboardy things with very little filling. We've gotten to the point of picking up entrees here and our egg rolls at.wait for it.Jack in the Box!,2
"We booked Kassie as our nanny for our 5 month old daughter and she was very professional, helpful and friendly. Our night out on the town for Father's Day weekend was so helpful thanks to her. The agency themselves are also quite helpful with explaining all prices upfront and their licensed insured status is a keeper. I look forward to using them again for my next Las Vegas family trip.",2
"This show was an expensive snooze fest. What there is of a plot is boring, the music is spacey, and the peaceful sound of flowing water put me to sleep. I would not recommend this show and I would not go back. I've been to Cirque shows and loved them. Not so with this show. The venue is nice and customer service for getting the tickets was great. There are better shows in Vegas.",1
Portions too small. My husband and I both got quiche. My husband went home and ate breakfast again. Service was terrible refill on coffee came almost at end of meal. There was no dressing on salad we couldn't ask server because she never came back to table. We had to get up to get the bill. The only thing good was the view.,1
After shopping at Sears I decide to check out the mall. What the heck is going on with this mall? Its like a ghost town! So many stores are closed.I miss Brookstone! I guess its a sign of the times. nBut there are still a bunch of shoe stores. And they have a Anchor Blue now and Fredricks is still open. I dont get over to this mall hardly ever anymore and I dont know when I will be back.,1
"As the others have stated, this place is great! The ingredients are fresh, the portions large, and the prices reasonable. The next time I order the Pad Thai I'll request it be made a bit less sweet and have them add some chili sauce for some ""bite "" as I'm used to having it less sweet and a bit spicy. Every order is cooked up fresh so special requests aren't a problem.",2
"Great service, very kind, would highly recommend. They are not the cheapest shop, so if that's what you're looking for, this isn't it. But they offer quality service you can trust and the best customer service I've experienced at an automotive shop. They are worth the price in my opinion but if price is your main concern, it may not be. All the things people say are true, great shop.",2
"Two things I love Tarte au citron and tarte au chocolat. These two things are done fabulously here. I've bought 10? 20? of them in the past year, year and a half and have never been disappointed. The batards are also very very good. Come to think of it, I've not been disappointed here. I think it's cash only though.",2
"Ugh.not good. The customer service was bad. They gave us, water and didn't come back for awhile. They had buy one get one free. We got the taco plates with chicken. The chicken was mushy and tasted like tuna. I ordered a side of sour cream. She forgot it and it took about 5 minutes to get it. We didn't finish. Server didn't ask how our meal was.",1
Whatever happened to a real dueling piano bar? They sing the same 'ol songs every night and don't ever change it up. It's perfect for after a hockey game when you've already had a few and can sing just as obnoxiously as everyone else. I would be scared to eat the food. The service is super slow. Maybe the food is good if you drank too much and can't taste anything anyways.,1
"NOTHING, not a single main dish Vegetarian and no willingness to adapt anything. Fries OK, they were vegetarian came out cold and once the waitress dropped the food, we didn't see her. No one came around to pepper the salad which contained fish and the pre ground stuff on the table didn't even come out the holes. Arrogant staff for mediocre food and service. Could be a gem, but isn't.",1
"One of my favorite places to get a brew and relax. Great neighborhood feel and always some locals drinking alone at the bar chatting with the bartenders. And I'll tell you what, I love a place where I feel comfortable enough to have a beer by myself without feeling like a raging alcoholic. Very mixed crowd where everyone is welcome. Definitely the right mix of dive bar and neighborhood hangout.",2
"Joe's Farm Grill is great. I may be a little biased as I'm in walking distance, but the food is fresh and very tasty. I have had both the breakfast and dinner items i've tried several and I've never been disappointed. It's great to sit outside in the 75 degree weather. From the gourmet pallet to the kid in all of us, Joe's will hit this spot.",2
"Below average tacos at best. Each one was about 1.79. You might think that's a good price until you try them. The carne asada was bland, dry and the quality of the meat was poor. The al pastor was better, but also dry. My expectations for the pork were high when I say the meat on a spit, but it doesn't come close to al pastor at other places around town.",1
"My favorite bar in the whole wide world! This place is probably what I miss most about AZ. Although it's in Scottsdale, you do not get the ""scottsdale "" crowd thank god and they play the best music around. If you like bikes, loud rock music, half naked girls and dancing on bars. this place is a must!",2
"Salsa was wonderful! But nothing else. Chicken enchiladas tasted like stewed chicken sitting in a pot all day and then put in small floured tortillas and added bland sauce. 4 or 5 for 18 bucks? nThe 3 crispy fish tacos were over cooked, no sauce in them with stale floured tortillas. nWe were disappointed. nAtmosphere was nice.",1
I took my daughter there for her birthday party and the nail technician rushed through her nails and never put a top coat on them. All the nails clipped within less then 24 hours. I'm not impressed and it's like pulling teeth to get the job done correctly. It's taking extra time out of my busy life to get them repainted correctly within their time frame. This was at the SouthPark location.,1
"I stayed here for business. The room I got was average, but again my company paid for it, so for being what it was, it was nice. The casino is amazing, I actually won 100.00 from a five on a slot machine. The place has some amazing statues, and the shopping complex is pretty awesome too. If I go back to Vegas, this is definitely where I would like to stay.",2
Encore is one of the more lavish and opulent hotels on the strip. We booked a package online for 3 nights stay plus round trip ticket for 600 with 75 credit! The rooms were huge. The service are superb. The casinos are close by. The room doesn't stink like some of the hotels in Vegas. The only problem we had was we wanted a late check out and was not available. Definitely would stay here again!,2
"Our family celebrated a college graduation at Taggia. We dined al fresco. Our group had a wonderful staff member taking care of our every need. Our food was delicious and beautifully presented. We were able to enjoy our meal at a perfect pace, from cocktails and appetizers to desserts and digestifs. It was one of those evenings that didn't eveeed a jacket. Perfect.",2
"Best grilled cheese ever. EVER. nIt's super dark in here like very almost uncomfortably dark if it was a first date, or someone you didn't really know. The entire room we were in was lit by only 5 votive candles. nThe music was good, the food was awesome. It was a good stop off the light rail only about a 6 minute walk.",2
"Most boring strip club in Phoenix metro. For typ Sat nite, Paid 13 bucks cover, yes 13! Why 13? Then one bud light bottle cost 6.25 round that up to 7 for tip, then a lousy table dance for 10 bucks. I lost 30 bucks in 15 minutes. After that, I even rejected one girl cause she looked high on something and ugly with her eyes half opened. I am a local and I am never going back there again.",1
I am now hooked on eating here a few times a week! Their chicken pita sandwich 1 is amazing with grilled chicken and feta slaw. I seem to be gravitating to that sandwich and the kabob with rice. I love that the food is fresh and reliable. This is such a great alternative to fast food. I just wish they were open later than 8pm.,2
"Leash Hot Dogs has been around forever. Why? Because it's good, and unusually cheap in price, not food that is . Get a Recession special which has been raised to from 1.99 w the Banana Daiquiri, it comes with two hot dogs. Now that's not bad at all. And the hot dogs are excellent, some of the best I've ever had. It's a West Side phenomenon that you shouldn't miss.",2
Honestly I end up wondering why I still come here when I can go to a competitor that has a lager drink for cheaper then here looks nicer and kept up better even I can't use the Competitor's Wifi cause the wifi sucks here and they lie about why it is so slow here. As well as not getting parents to control there kids when the place has no play area for them.,1
"Decent and good live music until they served my husband's food cold and my salmon piping hot, but raw. When we told the server and she responded that ""we will do it better when you come back next time "" we decided to never come back again. Fat chance!. Yuck and in every way a way to ruin an appetite!",1
"This is the worse place I have ever been, the service was terrible. The server did not look like she cared about her job. The wings were beyond gross, McDonald's has better wings than them. The wings were so bad that they got me super sick and I was throwing up all night. I would never go back or recommend to go there.",1
"Yummy yummy. This place is inside the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace so it's kinda gaudy outside. BUT, the food is pretty good and it's very decently priced if you sit on the outside cafe patio. The menu is different FYI. I had the chopped veggie salad and my boyfriend had the bbq chicken sausage pizza which were both excellent. I definitely recommend.",2
"In Pittsburg for one day. We asked 3 different locals where to find some good clean organic food. All 3 times we got the same response.Marty's Market. The atmosphere is very wholefoodie but much more dine in. The food was fantastic and the service was equally good. If you ever find yourself in Pittsburg and wanting to eat some clean organic food I highly, highly recommend going to Marty's.",2
The place is dirty. The table I got wasn't fully cleaned. There was trash from the previous people that sat there. The jukebox was really dirty and didn't even work. The bathrooms needed to be cleaned. They kept other tables dirty with the plates until a new customer needed a seat. I won't be going back to this 5 Diner.,1
"Never been impressed with the food, been here a few times, will never go back. And there's a girl behind the counter that talks LOUDER than anyone I have ever encountered. Now whenever we hear a loud person we say 'The Gadzooks girl must be here "". Someone needs to tell her to stop screaming ""PICO DE GALLO?!?! "" before she scares off more customers.",1
Sorry! I've seen all of the Cirque shows several times and being this is one of the latest I had to see it! I found it confusing and boring! The Story line was? The performers were doing a great job but what language were they using and what were they saying! We had exceptional seats but don't waste your money. Any other Cirque show is much more entertaining for the price!,1
"Lovely and inventive tapas. We shared tender octopus, roasted potatoes, skewers with shrimp, sausage and filet and amazing shrimp and mangos with soy ginger sauce. The sausage was absolutely amazing. Everything was perfectly spiced and prepared. The space is an awkward set up and on a cold evening, the wind came through and it was bone chilling.",2
I love this place! They don't have it on the menu any more but one of my favorite things you can still order is Mediterranean style calamari. The gator appetizer has the best sauce too. My favorite experience there was when they had a live jazz band playing. It's very noisy and crowded and usually you have to wait for a table but it's SO worth it if you like seafood.,2
This place is great! We go for dessert several times a month. We love it because they have many options and love that you can make it all by yourself. It is really clean and the staff is always polite and helpful. The cups size can be a little deceptive so watch out how much yogurt you put in because you are paying by weight afterall!,2
"We love going to Carl's Jr for some quick burgers any time of day. The restaurant was repulsing. It smelled like an animal took a massive, fresh dump in the middle of the room. GROSS. Also, if you have to use the restroom, DON'T GO HERE. My husband and I both used the restroom to our dismay. They smelled worse than the whole restaurant itself, and that's saying something. The food was fine though.",1
"Wow, holy curry explosion. nI wouldn't say I'm a gyro expert but do enjoy eating them from time to time. This was my first experience with Gyros Express and I don't think I will be going back. nThe price seemed a little high and although the gyro was full of meat, all I could taste was curry. and I like curry. Just not an entire spice rack full. nDefinitely not what I was hoping for.",1
"We went for brunch on a Saturday 10a . It was so bad! It was cheap so we didn't expect too much. But, the food was cold by the time we got back to our seats, and were close to the Buffett. nCold eggs, cold waffles, cold syrup and cold over cooked bacon. The hummus was good. I ended up eating salad and hummus for brunch. Too bad!",1
"Thank you to Yelp again we found this great spot so close to the hotel we could walk. The line was out the door but moved quickly. The cashier was nice and answered all my questions. Everyone was happy bloody marys, specialty coffees, great breakfast items. We will return the next time we are in Tempe.",2
"we went there for lunch today had 3 meat tro and ala cart white meat chicken. nfirst there sauce is awe full 2 the meat doesnt have a smokey flavor at all brisket uck! spare ribs tuff and no flavor, chicken bland and flavorless tasted boiled. n Only things that were edible were the hot links and the potato salad was dank. hands down worst bbq Ive ever had bar none",1
Jessica is the BEST in Arizona! Top professional that I recommend to everyone interested in skin treatments or injectables. She is the Best of the Best and I will never trust another with my face. Highly skilled with anti aging and injectables! She took 10 years off of my face during the first appointment and I adore her for that! ,2
"Just like any other In N Out, busy as usual but never disappoints when it comes to the food. Plus, I enjoyed how generous the drive thru lady was. I asked for one spread, but she gave me two. Also they gave me more than enough ketchup packets which I enjoy since other fast food stores get stingy with the amount they give.",2
"sa horor. I rather stay at a motel. The suite is just a regular crappy room, but bigger. I feel dirty even after I showered. There's no ""do not disturb "" door signs to put on your door, so early in the morning the cleaning lady comes by and bangs on the door and just opens it before your eyes could even open with a big ""HELLLLO?! "" never again. chills I rather spend 500 bucks.",1
"It was a busy Saturday and I was with a friend, I did like that they were able to do my mani and pedi at the same time so that my friend and I who just got a pedi were done at the same time. However, my pedi was not very good.she rushed through it. I don't even remember the massage. I'm pretty sure they overcharged me too, but I didn't say anything. Oh well, I don't think I'll come back here.",1
"I started going to Elevation for 2 reasons, 1 it's at my gym, and 2 they use Bumble and Bumble products. I've continued to go because of the quality of the services they provide. All the staff are friendly. Becca cuts my hair, and I always leave feeling like I got what I wanted and that I am looking good. She also does free bang trims which is a great perk.",2
"never going back. The food was really blend, went with a colleague for lunch buffet, every Indian place I have ever been to at least had good chicken tikka masala but it was just too bad here, paneer was equally tasteless. The place was surprisingly full, probably due to lots of IT companies near by.",1
I hate to say this but I'm not a fan of this place. The music is awesome and I have listed to some greats acts that have stopped by. The times I have been to this club have been short and few. Each time I have stopped for a visit I'm wanting to go some where else. Its a small club and if its crowed you are limited to where you can dance. The decor is ok and it might be time for a make over.,1
"Stopped by for two red chili burritos around 1pm on a Saturday. They were out of red so I ordered green. As I waited and saw a few small groups of customers after me receive there order before me I asked for my order and the cook says ""it takes a few minutes for the chili to boil "" 45 mins after ordering I got my order. TWO RICE BURRITOS WITH SPOONFULL OF GREEN CHILI! Never again!",1
"Went to the Wine Warehouse on a Groupon, received a wine tasting and meat and cheese platter. The wine was awesome! For the meat and cheese platter you got 1 piece of pepperoni and 1 piece of salami, so that was a little lame. However, the server was really knowledgable and fun. The store offers a huge variety of wines and has a nice atmosphere, would go back and recommend for a relaxing night!",2
"Great pizza. The salad I ordered was kind of lacking, but lets be honest that my my error, you don't go here to order salads. The pizza was perfection. Great light and fluffy chew tot the crust. The base was light thin with. Slight crisp. The sauce to cheese and toppings trio was balanced. Great pizza!",2
"Over rated, and you pay for the pictures on the wall, not the food itself. The food was bland, unflavored the lobster was less tasty than something from red lobster. All the good tables are reserved for casino high rollers when I drop 500 for a meal, I don't expect to be treated as a second class citizen. Noisy atmosphere too. Wouldn't go back.",1
"Jeff and his partner were amazing. They were extremely punctual and very fairly priced. They were very quick, kind and most importantly carefull. My father's furniture that they helped move was all antiques which they were very careful and mindful of. They even offered suggestions of where to put things! I will absolutely only use them for any move this point forward!",2
"We went to Schnepf Farms for the Peach Festival this past year and it was a great experience. We picked our own peaches, tasted many different products made with their peaches, and even enjoyed the peach pancake breakfast. I haven't yet been here during any other part of the year, but it's definitely worth a trip out during peach season.",2
"Overpriced, flavorless, hockey pucks for food. Shakes? Vanilla ice cream swirled with your flavor. The only good thing I ate were the onion rings until some employee decided to start mopping the floor with pine sol right around my table killing my appetite. Will never go back. And should have asked for a refund.",1
"This is a really cool, one of a kind boutique. They have some of the hippest frames that I've ever seen, both sunglasses and regular eyeglass frames that you can get your prescription lenses put in. The Owner, Christy, is very nice and genuine, with a true passion for style. You would be hard pressed to find a place like it definitely worth going out of your way for!",2
"4 stars for their mango margarita 1 star for service and 1 star for the food, that makes an average of 2 stars for the restaurant. Our waitress was unfriendly and slow. Food was just not good, beef and chicken were shredded and not identifiable as meat anymore, chicken tasted like tuna! Salsa was flavorless and tasted like water!?",1
"OMG I LOVE YOU JIMMY JOHNS. YOUR SUBS ARE SO MEATY. and fairly priced. The guys that work at Jimmy John's are pretty cute, to boot. They are SO FAST, too! The Gargantuan is my absolute favorite! It's gigantic! I've had it with, and without bacon, and I gotta say, it's better without the bacon. Bread is always fresh, flavorful, and perfectly baked.",2
Worst chain of restaurants in AZ. Go buy a Budget Gourmet tv dinner.heat it up and that's how Applebee's tastes. Rumor has it that they actually do use a microwave for most of their dishes. Pasta Alfredo is one of them. Just plain gross. The only reason I would go here is for their cheap happy hour for the drinks.,1
"Every time I go here something gets stolen. First it was my friends purse, then the next time it was my friends jacket. Last night it was my jacket along with my other friends jacket. I have no idea what is going on here but everyone agrees this place is shady and at this point it seems too coincidental. Beware and good luck.",1
My sister doesn't eat anything with feet she ordered a fish burrito I ordered a chicken one when we got our food we questioned them several time to make sure which was which they assured us we had it right my sister was a couple bites in before I realize I was eating fish. My sister was sick for the rest of the night very upset,1
"The reason for the one star is simply due to the attitude and service of the people that work here. Rude on the call in order, rude when picking up and not a thank you in sight. No offering of napkins, choice of dressing on a salad or utensils. With all the choices in Vegas, the owner had better have a talk with the employees. I will go elsewhere.",1
"I loved eating here, but as far as the nightclub goes, it's not my favorite. First off it's like a maze. The place is HUGE and gets way too packed. If you come with a big group, you're going to lose everyone. We always start off in the middle, get frustrated because there's no room to dance, go to the rooftop and dance a bit only to find that it's slowly getting packed. It's overwhelming.",1
"Had an ok time when I was there. The front desk was nice. Decor was ok. Typical of a ""spa "" that's not part of a resort. Saw James for a deep tissue and I'll never see anyone else. He also gave the most amazing scalp massage. I can't deny I've fallen asleep for him before haha Definitely makes it worth the money.",2
Great selection of import craft beers. If you are a cork dork get ready to spend some time perusing the depth of selection. More varieties of liquor than we have ever seen. We came for some very specific beers. They had multiple facings and hope they keep stocking the Franziskaner Weihenstephaner they are amazing.,2
" ""0 "" was simply outstanding. Cirque on water.in water.above water.marevelous! This was my second Cirque show and I loved it. From curtain up to curtain call you become enraptured.choose the cheap sets as you will have a better overall view.trust me our front row seats gave me a crick in the neck. .but that is my only complaint.!",2
"Service was horrible. Food and beer was good, but were ruined by a waitress trying to hurry us out the door and clear plates and glasses before we were finished. Don't go here if you actually want to be able to enjoy your meal and drinks. there are many many better places to eat and get a good beer around the capital.",1
"Wifi connection was terrible. it's almost same as NO INTERNET. When i enter the room, wall was broken. not clean. They just charge on my card EVEN BEFORE we get there. and then after trip. Another charge without any statement until we asked for it. what a unprofessional business. but poeple who works in front wa very helpful.",1
"Stopped for a quick dinner on a weeknight. The dining room is separated from the bar.in a completely walled off room, but you wouldn't have known it from the smell. Absolutely disgusting smell of stale smoke everywhere. We turned and left and won't be back. Too bad.a few years back this was an o.k. place, but a liberal smoking policy has turned it into a toilet.",1
"Yes it's a steakhouse but the best part of the meal was the wedge salad, the blue cheese dressing is phenom. The onion soup was good too. But the steak lacked flavor and my lobster was slightly over cooked and had too much ""char "", so tasted burnt. I was disappointed, maybe my expectations were too high.",1
It has a nice appearance but it is deciving. The bouncers and staff are extremely rude and clueless. They are no help when it comes to telling you where to go and they have no idea how to keep the club in order. It was overcrowded.and broken glasses were everywhere. I recommend going Aria. It's tons better. Only saving grace is the music was pretty decent.,1
"Love this place! Breakfast is always a hearty meal when you dine here. Yesterday, I went to pick up the famous Jack Daniels Pecan Pie for our Thanksgiving meal! I look forward to this every year! The pickup process is always very organized and convenient! Staff is very friendly on this busy day! The pies from Rock springs are a must try!",2
I have been my hair done by Chelsea five years now. She always does such a great job. Always fits me in last minute when I need my hair done. She also did my hair and all of my bridesmaids hair. I absolutely loved my hair and so did all of the girls. I get compliments on my hair all the time. Chelsea is a joy to be around always so upbeat and positive!,2
"I used to love this place until today, I'll never order from them again. I get the same dish every time and the chicken has always been good but tonight all the chicken in the General Tsos dish was pink. Did not look right. Called, took them 1 hr to deliver a new order of general Tsos chicken and it was still PINK and weird colored. Wai Wai lost a long time customer due to poor quality.",1
"I have the most amazing experience with this company! nProfessional ,Extremely Friendly and right on point .I recommend them to everyone that needs appliance services of any kind nI needed my dishwasher fixed and after I called Katanny the scheduled appointment the same day and the job was done the same day nLOVE IT !",2
"If you like a neighborhood type of coffee shop with plenty of personality and local flavor, this is the place for you. Even my wife, who isn't a fan of these places remarked that it was a great hangout. nI had a latte and she had a hot chocolate. Both beverages were excellent. We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the atmosphere. Next time we're in town, we'll be back.",2
"Been coming here for years and the place never disappoints. Whether you want breakfast, lunch or dinner the food is consistently good. I recommend the Loco Moco, Garlic Chicken, Saimin, Spam Musubi, BBQ Plates and you pretty much can't go wrong with whatever you order. Reasonable prices, portions are good too, so you shouldn't leave hungry.",2
This is our favorite local Italian place. The neighborhood and ambiance is not much but the food is outstanding. We always enjoy our meal and the portions are so large that we usually leave with lots of leftovers. Service is also very friendly and nice. We have recommended many friends and family to this place.,2
"We found this gem on Yelp while looking for Indian food after seeing the movie, The 100 foot Journey! Although new, and very few patrons there at the time, the food was GREAT! Chicken Tikki Masala was fabulous. The service was attentive and friendly. Hoping they will do well, as the location is quiet.but the food fabulous!",2
Stayed here when I needed somewhere affordable and not necessarily on the strip. The rooms were nice and clean. They were definitely worth the price. My group and I even had a lot of fun in the casino. The room had a minor maintenance issue during my stay but the staff was very responsive and had it fixed in minutes.,2
"I like the ambiance. That's it. Our waiter was a rude jerk, especially to those who only ordered the sides gee, greedy for a big tip? I tip on the service, not the amount of the bill . Truffle Mac and cheese had way too much truffle. Ehhhhh Cod was slimy. Yuck. 54 Salad was lettuce and dressing. Plain 14",1
"3 snaps in a Z Formation! Hope you got my early 90's In Living Color reference there. Well, if you're too young old or just plain lame and didn't watch the show back in the day, it translates to them being awesome! Above AND beyond customer service, as well as very fair pricing and great communication efforts. Wes was fabulous to work with!",2
"Wave House Cleaning is incredible. My girlfriend and I recently moved across town. Wave not only left the apartment we moved out of looking brand new, they made the unfortunately dirty house we moved into more than livable it was like night and day after they were done. I wouldn't look anywhere else for a cleaning service.",2
"Go somewhere else if you want a good deal. I did Cash for Clunkers 4,500 allowance and put down 5000 cash. Now it seems 5 years later I get to pay 33,000 for a Rav 4 that had a sticker price of 23,000. Buyer Beware! Somehow I purchased a vehicle, putting down 9,500 and got a ""leased car "" deal. Fast Talkers.Sleazy Deal!",1
What a disappointment! Ones you sing up there you will never be able to cancel your membership. They play this game between managers and associates and keep charging you. Overcrowded to enjoy workout and with every year goes down. Managers never return your calls and you are trapped in a vicious sickle. There are other clubs that are way better to accommodate you without the hustle.,1
"Best coffee in Arizona! It only took three months since moving here to find the perfect vanilla latte. I posted a review for It's a Grind Coffee House, and said they have the best espresso, but after discovering Elevate Coffee Co. I changed my mind. The former does have massive drinks if you want a huge blended drink, but as far as espresso and lattes go, this place rocks.",2
"If you're a big seafood fan like me, you'll love this place. I always order 1lb garlic shrimp, fried calamari and a cup of rice. Its delicious! The shrimp is a tad too spicy to me but the calamari actually balances it. The pricing is a bit too much for me. 1lb shrimp for around 10 and the fried food is also around the 10 range. Its very casual, dim and loud place. Go crazy with your food ",2
"The Sushi was delicious. The service couldn't have been worse. We were served by the owner, and he couldn't have been ruder if he tried. He rushed us, insulted us, and didn't bring all of us our food. Maybe he was just having a bad day. I know that happens. He just ruined a very special occasion we chose to have at his restaurant.",1
"I have been here twice while on business on that side of town. First shortly after they opened, and then this past week. First of, cant they smell how it reakes in this place? Im not so sure the firewood is helping the taste any. Also I had to order something else since they were out of hot dog buns. Seriously dont bother, you will leave stinky and disappointed.",1
"I have dreams about their poblano enchiladas. Why do I love food so much? Seriously, send help. The food tastes like your Nana made it with love . if you had a Nana. I have a grandma . she makes Swedish meatballs. Anyway. If she did make enchiladas drenched in a creamy poblano sauce, she would make them like Frank Lupe's makes them. It's even better when enjoyed on the patio.",2
"This freeway is my primary route back home and also to get to certain lunch destinations such as the Biltmore area. Depending on the time of the year and day of the week, traffic varies from heavy to light. Despite that fact, it is my favorite freeway among the rest due to its scenic views of various desert landscaps, hills and mountains.",2
Although the atmosphere is good like all BWW the food at this particular one is utterly disgusting. The wings are fatty and oil pours out of them when you bite into them. And you have to love the slimy feel of the skin on your lips. YUM! If I was only going for a beer then maybe I would come back but for food there are many fast food restaurants in the area that I would suggest picking from first.,1
"The service is so bad as is the food. The Manager could care less. The waitress lost our credit card but delivered the check and never told us. It took 28 mins to get check and we were late for event. The food is so bad, the last 2 times I chose to not eat at the Restaurant as the concession food is better at a High School football game. Avoid!",1
"Ahhh, I feel So much better now! I've been following Dr. Josh for Years and so happy he's mobile now!I hurt my back so i called Dr. J right away. We were scheduled to meet at my house at 6 but my car battery died 30 min before our appointment. He waited an extra hour for me tonight. His 20 years experience really shows",2
"Awesome Saturday breakfast buffet until 11am . I wanted a resort style brunch setting to treat my folks too while they were in town. The service here is impeccable as are the grounds, which deserve a good walking through after you gorge yourself on heaps of fresh fruit, pastries, bacon and eggs. Located in central Scottsdale.",2
A bundt cake was a previously unknown piece of food to me before this wonderful store too life over five years ago. Their chocolate cakes are amazing and I highly recommend them to anyone who loves sweets. Service is fast and friendly nPlace is an established neighborhood staple nCakes taste amazing,2
"Been eating there tamales since I was a kid, so good! But the last couple time I have gotten tamales the have been heavy on the corn meal and light on the meat. I truely hope it was a new cook or something along those line. But I have feeling the are being ""cost effective "". Still good but not at the level they use to be at",2
"Most disappointing meal I have experienced. Don't waste your time. 6 Different dishes all bland, lacked seasoning. Incredible bone in double pork chop with absolutely no flavor. Too much bacon in recipes. Two unsuccessful attempts on quail. Finally settled for cup of soup. Not going back. Simply don't deserve second chance they just can't execute. Too many good tapas choices in Charlotte.",1
"This food will blow your mind! The restaurant is small but it's so worth the wait. We tried basically everything because it was just one great dish after another, we had spicy pork bulgogi, leek pancake, stir fry rice noodles with beef, kimchi fries rice and dumplings.all fabulous! The owners are the chef and wait staff and are very friendly, they make the visit extra special.",2
"We've given this several tries now, most recently tonight. Apologies to those that love this place, but the pizza is not great. Too doughy, too thick. Pizza Brutta is much, much better. So is Villa Dolce in Middelton. I will say the antipasti we had the Parma was good. Service is good, friendly and the food comes out fast. But the pizza is meh.",1
I go here when I don't go to the Square for the other Indian places. Always my favorites are the chicken tikka masala and carrot halwa. The mango ice cream is always good. The chutneys are varied but mango chutney is extra. The naan could be better. The only other negative is the restroom. Its unpleasant.,2
"My wife and I both had fish, and frankly our fish was not fresh, but was starting to go off. They did comp a significant part of the meal when we complained, so I have bumped them up to 2 starts, but really guys. This is a really expensive restaurant specializing in seafood the seafood had better be really fresh!",1
Go to Postinos on Monday and Tuesdays. 20 for a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine. You can even cork your wine and take home what you're not able to drink. The special starts at 8pm and gets packed but it is so worth the wait. This is one of my favorite restaurants. The entire staff is absolutely wonderful and friendly. They make every visit extremely enjoyable.,2
"They also do not pay their vendors. We took an order from them at a tradeshow, shipped the order right away and 6 plus months later we are still waiting to get a return call on the past due amount let alone any money. They never return phone calls and their staff on the phone are just plane rude. I would not recommend buying or selling anything to them. Our attorney's have take over this account.",1
"I don't understand the hype. I had the Carribean Jerk Chicken. Something about it just tasted boring. When I go back and get a different sandwich I will update. This sandwich was just too greasy for me, and not enough ingredients with really doughy bread. Great if you are drunk. I'm headed for Capriotti's next time, they have sandwiches I dream about.",1
"i tried this place in NY, it was great, but usually i'm in NY in the winter and i can't enjoy the Frozen Hot Chocolate fully.but when i was in Vegas it was a blazing 109, the hot desert of Vegas made the Frozen Hot Chocolate a perfect dessert during a hot Vegas afternoon! can't vouch for the food, it looked good tho, all i had was the Frozen Hot Chocolate!",2
"I am huge fan of this place! I have been going there for about 3 years now as they are very close to my office. I can call in an order, drive over there in 5 minutes and it is ready for me. It is always the same gentleman helping me as the cashier. The quality of the food is AWESOME! I am pretty snobby about my Asian food . The only thing that I get confused on is do I tip?",2
This is the slowest most unorganized domino's I have ever been in. Service is terrible. They can't even fold the boxes right. There aren't many pizza joints to choose from out here but I wouldn't choose this one. Also when did they start charging for crushed red peppers and parm. cheese. That is just dumb.,1
"Disappointed! I don't mind a hole in the wall restaurant that needs remodeling as long as the food is good, but this just didn't do it for me. I ordered a spicy yellowtail roll and smoked salmoigiri. The roll was bland and I question the freshness of the fish. The smoked salmon was ok but just did not compare at all to Sakana or Sushiya. nNot ever coming back.",1
"Nothing stood out about the place. I had lunch here with a friend that is a fan of the place. The lunch came and it was just fine. Besides being quiet and appearing clean the place looked more Japanese than Chinese to me. And the waitperson, well she was icy and abrupt. nI'm just not feeling that it's a place I will be wanting to revisit anytime soon.",1
This place is authentic because the BBQ is so greasy. The wood piece that they use to cut the meat is so nasty. Years and years of residue that got absorbed into the wood. Yuck! I do not think they ever clean that thing. That is what turned me away from this place. I did not even dare to eat any of the entrees. No thanks. BB KING has just lost it's throne !,1
"Love this place! Always loved the one on Rainbow but this location on Sahara opened not too long ago and the interior is so modern edgy, great music too! Hot tamale roll will always be my favorite to order haha, I don't know any other sushi places who make that roll so. Oyshi is my 1 sushi place in town. Enjoy your food!",2
"Don't miss this place if you LOVE a good cupcake. Store is fun, the cupcakes are beautiful tasty . Some even have fairy dust on them so they twinkle sparkle. Loved the orange lemon. Great flavor, perfect texture and good balance of frosting. Grab a cold milk or a cup of coffee enjoy. And . EAT MORE CUPCAKES!",2
"This place was fine for my 2003 Ford escape, but i can't trust it with my new Lexus because one time the brush fell off or something. I heard a loud thunk and they stopped the wash. I should have gotten out, but it was dripping everywhere and i had other things to do. Later I realized my paint was cracked in the back, no noticeable dent but my car must've been hit pretty hard. Beware!",1
I have walked past on many a busy and packed house. This day was quiet and nice we were able to sit on the upper deck. Simple tavero frills go to the bar to order and the drinks are good. no skimping on the liquor here. Missed the entertainment because we were hungry and they don't serve food. So if you just wanna get your drink started this is a good first stop,2
My first venture to this place after a friend wanted to try it out. The food was good but not great. I had the BLT and it was tasty. My friend got the scallops and it had a funny after taste. I must say I would definitely be back just for the Macallan Ice Ball. It's a perfect round sphere of ice for the perfect Scotch.,2
"My family and I have been dining here for a few years now. Only thing I don't like are the odd hours, because it can be confusing at times. Seriously. There was a time we went to have lunch sometime during the week, and it was 3pm. When we got there, they were closed. Anyway, the food is great. The service isn't bad not AMAZING, but not bad. ",2
"Good for me 3 or 4 stars nHusband rates this 4 or 5 stars nAveraging 4 Stars We ordered a couple curry dishes, rice, and spring rolls nWe requested that everything be medium hot and asked for a side container of their hot chili sauce. Which the lady said, Oh yes, that's a good idea. "" We also ordered the iced coffee.FABULOUS!",2
"Meh, I've experienced better is the caption that goes along with selecting two stars and yes I've definitely experienced better at this restaurant. I highly recommend breaking out the time machine and visiting District American Kitchen and Wine Bar last year. I don't know why they had to change a good thing but the food is a definite miss. Here's to hoping things will come around.",1
"Service was SOOOO slow. The food was overpriced and less than desirable. The decor was straight out of Three's Company at the Regal Beagle. We would have fared better by bringing McDonald's in to eat and enjoy the view. Oh, and the AC was cranking out subzero temps. I wished I had brought my parka with me.",1
"We had a long wait at the airport. This was the only available option outside the security gate. So we did try it. The food was ok. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the extra 2,70 I was charged for more salsa for my nachos I ordered in addition to the burrito I had. Total damage this day 2 Persons 32.",1
"I'm a local and have waited to write a review hoping that this place would sharpen up. New name but same terrible food. Reading other reviews made me realize that I'm not alone in feeling this way. The chandler Gilbert area has countless great restaurants and bars, and it is shameful that dukes can't get it together.",1
"Received great assistant from the new manager on duty, was told that he's the new branch manager or one of them, Michael L. Needed some money exchange from another branch and couldn't get it and was told to stop here. Easy and painless process, will definitely recommend this branch if you are in the area.",2
I usually go to square cafe on weekends and I love the outdoor seating and that dogs are welcome. My only complaint is that I wish there was a better wait system. The location makes it difficult to wait because of the size of the space. but not much can be done about that. Food is always excellent and the service has no room for complaints. Love it!,2
"The Place is Nice,the Music is Fantastic,BUT the Food is OK not good just OKAY. nI was really Surprised when I ordered my 20oz Steak and it came with the same Flavor from a small Restaurant at the Corner, the Only difference that the Bill Was hugeeee for 4 Persons for a Service and taste of food like that.",1
"My kids and I stayed here last weekend and we enjoyed our visit. Nice room with a safe. Great pool and there was a DJ on sunday.fun! The gym facility was nice and good machines. My kids enjoyed the Sirens of TI show. Just an all around nice hotel and casino. We got the 79 a night TV special, great deal! I will for sure be back next summer.",2
"I do not understand the hype about this place. Everything is incredibly overpriced and the food is less than mediocre. I did enjoy the bbq shrimp app but the entrees were miserable. I got the shrimp Diane which I'm pretty sure was just shrimp, mushrooms, white rice and chicken broth. Thank God I only went bc I had a groupon.",1
"Good portion of food for the price. However, their salad lacks substance and dressing blend. Their meat is cooked well a bit dry but lack any kind of flavor. It doesn't seem like they marinate their meat. Even rice lack flavor. I have had better.much better Greek food for that price. Not going back.",1
"Watch out the lady outside to greet you when you get your car is a salesperson .without you knowing ,they will charge you ""Basic Protection "" without informing you the cost 30 bucks a day .not cool especially when your in a rush .keep asking question . If there is a name for it. It it will cost you something .",1
"I ordered a chicken salad from this place last night and it was below average. The chicken was warm, but definitely not hot. And the french fries on the salad were cold. While the portion size was quite large, it was a very poor product. The only reason I ordered from this place is because it is pretty cheap even cheaper with a coupon code on Grubhub , but it definitely wasn't worth the 7 I paid.",1
"The workers were nice I guess, the food wasnt very good. Everything about the place just seemed so damn old the wallpaper plates, ceiling, and decor. You dont expect much from a buffet, I would like to feel a little cleaner while I eat. I typically dont eat buffets, but we dont have these in Minnesota and I thought we would try it.",1
"Terrible shuttle service. When you come out of the terminal, you can't see the sign telling you where to stand it's 3 feet off the ground and surrounded by the crowd of waiting people. Then there aren't enough busses. No where near . We waited over 30 min for a bus. There's no organization, no one directing drivers or people. Weakest shuttle I've experienced. A shame. Avoid.",1
"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! I got bailed on without a phone call for my appointment with Illuminate You. I quickly called Diana of BOLD Body Bronzing who SPED to my hotel last minute to provide an AWESOME spray tan session for me and SAVED THE DAY!. SHE was a true professional. You're welcome, Illuminate You. Hopefully no one else makes a huge mistake by calling that scumbag instead of Diana ",2
"Horrible! I've been living in the neighborhood for 15 years and have unfortunately ordered at this KFC dozens of times. I can't think of a single time where something wasn't wrong with the orders. They manage to screw up anything! The employees are usually impolite and or grumpy, and the chicken is rubbery and slimy. Mediocre at best.",1
"Lunch at this place is always crowded, especially with people who work at the hospital. However, its worth it. I had the red pepper hummus wrap and my sister had the fish tacos. Both were very tasty. It can be loud since its crowded, but we didn't mind. They're quick, have good service, and have multiple vegan options. Also, its close to Pitt and if you're a student you should try it out.",2
I stopped by this bar because a friend knows the owner. The patrons were nice and the bar tender was fantastic. I gave it one star because the owner little dude and his wife drunk with an attitude really don't care about their patrons. Not a good experience for non locals and I would not suggest this bar.,1
"We went last weekend and had a ton of fun. There were about 5 or 6 trucks and all sounded great. Apparently they rotate the trucks every week, so you can go and get something different each time. We got a chicken and rice stew from a Caribbean African truck and it was excellent. They also had gingerbeer which was so amazing! We will definitely return.",2
"I regularly get my hair colored and cut here. It is the best salon I've been to in Las Vegas. Everyone is incredibly nice and there is nothing stuck up about the place. Of course the service they provide is awesome too. Paul does my hair and Eric cuts it, always the best. I've also gotten great manicures from a few of the girls there. I highly recommend.",2
"The decor is good and the staff attentive but the food took an inordinate amount of time to arrive. When it finally did arrive, the sandwiches were smaller than what I'd make at home. My husband asked the manager about it and we were told they focus more on pizza and pasta. Not impressed and won't blow our dining budget on it.",1
"Mal wieder ein sch u00f6nes Steak gegessen und es genossen. Der Laden ist famili u00e4r und nicht wirklich mit den gro u00dfen Ketten vergleichbar. Die Qualit u00e4t des Essens ist sehr gut, die Bedienungen sehr umsichtig und freundlich und die Preise sind sehr human. nEin Besuch ist wirklich zu empfehlen.",2
"Food tasted fine once it actually got there but the service was terrible everything took forever. We split a chicken sandwich with fries and a cheeseburger salad with the black bean burger. It was too expensive for what it was, especially considering the service. After reading reviews more closely, we will try diamond next time instead.",1
Well I gave them another shot. If the manager is reading this. Get out on the floor and talk to your customers and make sure things are getting done. nService started out good then waited 15 min for the check. OnionI rings were cold. Burger good. Kids tacos were ground beef with no seasoning. nThey just seem to not want to try at this place.,1
"Recently I have been shopping at Sprouts and I realize that Sprouts have a wider selection of Gluten and NON GMO foods. I like Whole Foods but Sprouts has better food selection for me.Whole Foods is just to ""Commercial Synthetic "" food chain.over priced Groger, Safeway.so disappointed shopped there for years.",1
"I've been here twice for dinner and once for take out. All three times the sushi is yummy. They have some pretty imaginative rolls. Staff is very friendly, although once our service was very slow and both times eating in the table and benches have been sticky. Let's hope that doesn't have anything to do with how clean their kitchen is.",2
"I'm giving Chipotle a 2 only to differentiate them from Qdoba, which is definitely worse, but in a just world this would be a 1.5. The food is only nominally Mexican, meat is dry and not so flavorful, prices not all that reasonable, and the salsa tasteless. There's really no reason to go to either Qdoba or Chipotle with La Bamba and even better Los Amigos around.",1
"Went here a couple times liked the homemade lemonade, chicken the best fried chicken i've eaten in Az , catfish never had eaten catfish this good anywhere , waffles remind me of waffle house , corn bread, and mac n cheese. Didn't like the gizzards and gravy, but would go back to get the gizzards minus the gravy. Did I mention I am a fat fuck, oh yeah!",2
This review is for their bakery. We have ordered birthday cakes several times and they taste wonderful. My daughter was wanting the whole RockStar theme and the baker was no patient with us to help her create the perfect cake. There was a large selection of fillings and frostings. I was very happy how the cake turned out but mostly happy that everyone was saying how great the cake tasted.,2
