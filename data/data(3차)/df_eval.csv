Awsome ladies! I was in Vegas on vacation and needed another skien of Cascade super wash 220. My husband didn't want to take a cab and so called up the ladies at the store. They picked us up from the strip and took us back when we were finished shopping! This store has some fantastic local yarns that are hand dyed as well as a great selection of better European brands too. All around a great time!,2
We got seated right away. Took 15 mins to place drink orders then waiter disappeared for 20 mins before taking our food order. I almost walked out it was such bad service. Took 25 mins for food to come and my order was WRONG! We asked for BBQ sauce three times from three different waiters and it never came. Rediculous! The service was unbelievably bad. I left a 0 tip!,1
"I live 5 blocks away and waited 2 hours for a delivery. The pizza really was terrible, seriously not even decent. Oh, yeah, the toppings were expensive too. The one cool thing was that the delivery guy gave us a second pie for being so late. I am done with this place. Dominos would have been twice as good for half the price and it would have taken a third of the time.",1
Not the best hookah bar I've been to but not the worst either. Staff is friendly unless someone else is there. A little pricey but chill place. Food is served but I didn't try. Just a little small although they offer private rooms but for more money. Most hookah lounge that is standard. They need to expand to get my business again.,1
"As a local, I have tried many buffets. It was okay. Buffet is small and limited selection vs other grander buffets in the city. I didn't feel it was worth the price. While Wynn is exceptionally beautiful, I was surprised to see the limited selection and size at Wynn. Will need to expand to attract more people.",1
I have been going to Dominique Pfeiffer to have gel manicures twice a month for many years. She always does outstanding work and I can count on her to be there on time. I enjoy spending time with her and I know I will leave a good impression wherever I go with how professional and beautiful my hands look! I can't recommend her highly enough. For an appointment call or text her at 702.281.1622.,2
I got a car wash Wednesday at noon and it rained at 6pm that same evening. Next day I took my car in for a raincheck and they refused to let run it through for a 3 car wash. They don't realize that I will now drive out of my way to find better customer service! They just lost 3 cars from my household.,1
"After my first Primanti experience, here's how I'd sum it up just okay This place undoubtedly has a cult following and I respect it , but it's grown to be one of the spots where the hype just compounds one person after another. I'd rate the sandwiches a solid ""average, "" the service ""pretty poor, "" and price as ""dirt cheap. """,1
Great customer service from the moment I walked in until the moment I walked out! Great staff! Megan was very personable and nice! She did an amazing job in little to no time! Purchased a by 9 get 2 free wax service. They offer so many opportunities for their clients to save money and enjoy their great services.,2
"This place has an interesting atmosphere inside, but we loved eating on the patio. We had tasty salmon cakes and good mussels as appetizers. The sake sangria was interesting and refreshing and a generous portion . The volcano rolls were delicious, and the tiramisu was a fantastic end to the meal. The server was very pleasant too.",2
"This place is hideous. My boyfriend ordered a fried rice. The fried rice was just rice, soy sauce,raw onions, lots and lots of raw onions, green onions and bean sprouts. It came cold. What a disgrace. The waiter took his plate and told him that he shouldve said no onions. HE WOULD HAVE IF IT WAS ON THE MENU IN THE FIRST PLACE.",1
"Hello Lo Lo! Oddly off the Main street but that's cool. Our server was cute, attentive, and welcoming. They were playing gospel music in the background. It's all about the food baby! It's simple down home fare and they do it well. If you're looking for something different and you're near the airport. Try it.",2
Went in for a mani pedi. Pedi was okay until I got home and the polish wiped off. I got a mani too so it shouldn't have been wet. It was an hour after the polish was on. My ankles got scrapped up too. The mani was okay but the Polish wasn't put on evenly and I had to file the extra off when I got home. Definitely won't be going back.,1
"I went to purchase a shelf today. The lady who rang me up was unfortunately rude. Honestly, I'm new to Las Vegas and my husband deployed last week. My experience there left me upset and emotional and I was really surprised at her nastiness over a very small misunderstanding her misunderstanding since I've since checked and it should not have been a problem . I will not go back.",1
"Basic, bland cafeteria fare. I had the beef burrito. Found the beef to be flavorless. The big tortilla was nice. There were no authentic flavors spices jumping out. Its not surprising alot of people on here like the place, the food is bland and predictable, it is very Americanized Mexican food. For a chain Mex restaurant, Chipolte beats this place.",1
"Wow! Best meal I've had in Charlotte, hands down. The tapas plates were perfectly portioned, and each item, from the risotto to the crispy quail lettuce wraps, were out of this world. Top it off with a fantastic slice of chocolate cheesecake, and this is a meal I'll be coming back for again and again.",2
"Well, it is a McDonald's attached to a gas station so what can you expect. First thing that irritated me with this place. the drive thru. Sometimes, it is inconveniently closed during peak morning hours. Why? I don't know. I'm assuming they are understaffed. Second, the bathroom is disgusting and unisex. I won't let my poor daughter use it even if she is about to pop.",1
My friends and I went here on a recent trip to vegas. Saw all the yelp reviews and figured we had to give it a shot. We all had burgers of various kinds with fries and a soda. None of the burgers stood out because the only thing we really tasted was the ton of salt that had been put on it and the fries. We all three left feeling Ill from the OD of salt.,1
"So my I brought my folks here for a post Christmas dinner. I ordered my favorite pineapple rice. Not only did they make it spicy, I found a strand of hair! So the server made us a new one. But it was still spicy. I have brought my guests and friends here many times but this experience ruined it. Makes me wonder how sanitary they are in the kitchen.",1
This place is always busy and I understand they are busy but every time I ordered they take ten or more minutes. And they miss an ingredient I liked their sub but all the wait and missing ingredients isn't worthwhile. Also the cashiers aways leave the area when I am about to order to do something else. Horrible,1
Thank you to Bonnie T. who mentioned that Village Pizza had moved to 815 S. Aiken Ave. I will leave my review there! BTW that move also came with a name change they are now S. Aiken Bar and Grille. I was so sad when I walked by the old Village Pizza and they were closed. When I read that they had moved I walked to the address and was even more confused that it did not say 'Village Pizza'.,2
"I have been coming to this store particularly because Picture People has put a studio inside the store. While waiting for photos to be processed, I walked the store. I was amazed at the cleanliness, variety of product, and friendly staff. I haven't been to this store during the weekend but during the week it was not crowded.",2
"Excited to go to BurGR. Don't go out for burgers all that often, but we loved the ones we ordered Earth and Farm Burgers. They were juicy and moist, not dried out and just old bread. Truffle Parmesan Fries could have been crisper but were very tasty. Hoped for a wider selection of beers which seemed a bit reserved.",2
Yummy! I stopped in after a doctor appointment and was really impressed! nI am really allergic to red sauce and so I really have to be careful when ordering pizza. They had a delicious spinach Alfredo npizza with a white sauce! nTasted amazing and was really filling! Nice people and good service. I will be back!,2
"Went back to this place for a return trip to vegas, and its changed alot. Its completely overpriced with ridiculous prices for food and drink. They wanted 20 bucks for 3 tasting of their brewed beer and 10 bucks for most drafts. The hot wings were 13 dollars for an order, ill never go back and was sorry I brought my group here. I know its Vegas, but man what happened to this place.",1
I gave this place another try at the end of 2010. I laughed at myself. I couldn't believe I gave them a second chance. I literally try to grasp and understand why people go here. If anyone else find a really good dish let me know. The BBQ I've tried has no flavor. Like how does mac n cheese and green beans taste nasty? LOL,1
"Your not being truthful now Ross. We watched you questioobody after us! As mid age business meot young concert goers, your excuses match your arrogance. Your style and energy are poor examples of how a business should be run. Hospitality is obviously not your strength. Cool space, weak selective service and excuses! Bitter and Selective! Good luck in the future",1
"The food presentation is not that impressive. There is a lot James Dean, Elvis and Marilyn Monroe chotskies, which makes it look like a diner instead of a breakfast place. No designated hostess, 2 registers, yet no one seems to know what is going on. Front of house management.well, what FOH management?",1
"This is by far the best Chinese food we have ever had! My wife and I tried almost every Chinese restaurant in the bay area when we lived in San Francisco, and nothing is close to Wahsun. The sign on the door says they are closed for remodeling. I'm ready to bring my tools and help get it finished so I can eat some more of their fabulous food! Hurry up and reopen, Rose! We miss you!",2
"Tried this place for the first time. The maple bars are incredibly soft and delicious. My wife has very high donut standards and even she said this was right up there with some of the best we've ever had. There seemed to be a wide variety of treats available here, but we just had the maple bars. Darn, we'll have to go back now.",2
"Bought a Groupon and have never been able to use it as this place does not appear to still be open. Most recently, I tried on a Saturday night at 7 00 PM Closed! I have tried to call and verify their hours and reach a message with ""Mailbox Full. "" Also appears that they last updated their website over a year ago so no help there. Don't waste your time with this place.",1
"Wow you can get kick out of a casino and banned for winning money. They are willing to take your money, but once you start to win, they can kick you out of their property and kick you out of the room as well. There should be some type of Federal Law that protects gamblers. If you lose your life savings you cannot get your money back. Any class action law suit out there?",1
"The yellow and red curries are delicious, and the eggplant was good too. My girlfriend said the primary color scheme felt like a Gymboree. We did have to wait a while to be seated and have our order taken. Better Thai food than I expect from the Midwest. I will be going back as it's a nice alternative to all the crappy chain food in off the beltway.",2
"Just ate here today for lunch, not too bad 5.50 for two slices and a drink. The pizza was very good, good taste and the crust was really crispy but didn't cut the roof of your mouth, I like that. The place was also really clean, not too large but most people just grab and go. The staff was also very friendly and made sure to say hi and thank them for coming in to everybody.",2
"If your in Charlotte definitely make your way to Cajun Queen, highly recommend making a reservation you will be seated quickly and highly recommend using there complimentary valet parking you just have to tip the guys, great New Orleans Cajun creole style food in Charlotte, their Sunday brunch is awesome as well!",2
Our flight out is canceled with no explanation and all other flights today are over sold. One of the flights we are on stand by for is already two hours late. I hold out little hope that things are going to get better with the merger with AA. Once again I am asking myself why I fly anyone other than Southwest.,1
"More a business then a clinic. a certain degree of care for the animals, but in my opinion and experience, it's all about the almighty dollar there. I felt my pet was second over how much they could nickel and dime me for. After dollars spent, I went to another vet who put the animal first with the cost secondary. Again, my opinion only, not my type of vet clinic.",1
"Wow, this place is amazingly tasty and affordable! Came into this place shortly after it opened and i was blown away by the tastiness of their food. The Spam Misubi is tasty and well prepared. The macaroni salad is soo awesome it'll make you say ""Boom goes the dynamite! "" The inside is very plainly decorated but that doesn't matter when your food tastes that good. Try it, you'll be glad you did.",2
Alaskan clam chowder spicy level 5 nCombo panroast spicy level 5 Clam chowder was really good and it comes with a lot alot alot a lot of seafoods. The portion was really big too. My girlfriend and I could not finish both dishes. We barely had panroast which was little salty. I personally do not think their foods were worth the wait. Air in casino was shitty.,1
"This place doesn't need any reviews as evident by the 30 40 min wait periods every weekend. Parking is always a problem which, in a way, is a good indicator of things to come. The food and beer is great, obviously. I love the peach ale and hefeweizen. But THE FRIES! If you are a fries aficionado like me, you need to taste their beer battered fries. BEST. FRIES. I. HAVE. EVER. TASTED. That's all.",2
"Go to the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan! There's a place called secret pizza and it is really good! Pop Up Pizza is inside The Plazza Hotel and although it has a cute name and is inexpensive, it is about equivalent to Rays Pizza. We went there based on the 4 star reviews on yelp but after eating there I couldn't believe it was rated more than 2 stars.",1
"Officially the first time in history I've had a burger that tasted like a hockey puck. Eww. It was all round and dense and dry. I had to send the thing back FOUR TIMES for them to get my order correct. It was a BBQ jalape u00f1o burger. Doesn't seem too difficult, but apparently it was. We won't be back.",1
"We've made two visits here and have been pleased both times. Flatbread pizzas, wraps, panninis even their flatbread chips are good. They have a lovely selection of side salads if chips aren't your thing. Add reasonable prices 7 8 for meal and you have a wonderful alternative to the fastfood lunch options around.",2
"4.5 stars! Picked up a pizza and small order of garlic knots. I have no idea how big their large is, but the small order was definitely enough for 4 people. Comes with a side of delicious marinara also. Our pizza was pepperoni and mushroom and it was great, too. The pizza crust was not soggy at all. We loved it and wouldn't have found it without yelp ",2
"Awesome work, fair prices and great customer service. The whole crew is professional, especially Mike. He's warm, friendly and will go into detail about anything you might not understand or have questions about. And he always picks up his phone, even when he's off the clock! Guy works too hard hahahaha.",2
Danny opened the store this morning at 10am and he not only replaced my whole LCD but gave me a free screen protector and also honored the 35 for 55 deal from yelp. Told him I had work at 10 45 and Took him a total of 10 minutes and I was out the door! Got to work early. Great customer service and will be coming back for my gf's phone!,2
I've been going to Dr. Gramlich for years. The office staff are super friendly and knowledgeable and make you feel comfortable. Dr. Gramlich is also very thorough. He always takes the time to answer questions and doesn't make you feel rushed. I would highly recommend their office. They are topnotch!,2
"Absolutely disgusting. If you purchased the Groupon, I would get a refund. We went for lunch and were less than underwhelmed with the salad bar. The food they brought to you for the seafood potion was in a word inedible. Run, do not walk away from this very low end restaurant in Vegas. I would be surprised if it stayed open much longer.",1
"They fraudulently charged a ""destination fee "" of 23 on my credit card. They asked for the card for a security deposit, never mentioned these charges. I paid for my reservation through Orbitz. They get one star, because any business that commits fraud does not deserve to be patronized. I had stayed with them three times previously, but no more.",1
"After much frustration with this office, I am finally finding a new doctor. n1. Friendly office staff? They could care less. n2. Walk ins? Good luck with that! n3. Need a prescription refill? 2 weeks please. n.just a few reasons why I am extremely disappointed with my experience over the past 2 years and will be going somewhere else.",1
everyone there is very nice. bill the bartender is great! had the bbq sampler and i liked the pork the best .so i always get the bbq pork. comes with a few tortillas and it's awesome! mac and cheese is great and the smashed potato's are good too! wish they had some awesome baked beans but it is still great! stiff drinks aren't bad either.,2
"Over priced. The only cool part was the location of the restaurant. If the Olive Garden is the best Italian restaurant in your home town, then you will probably think this is the best place you have ever been too. If you do not want to deal with off the boat Italian servers who give you bad service and complain right in front of you when you give them a 20 tip, then go somewhere better.",1
"I have only had the flourless chocolate chocolate chip cookie and man was that cookie worth the couple bucks. I am a big fan of Diddy Riese but I gotta say, this place takes the cookie trophy.if we are simply talking about taste and quality Diddy Riese is still my favorite when it comes to accessibility and quantity haha .",2
I might go 3 but since this has Gordon's name on it ill make it 2. Fris u00e9e salad was underseasoned and bland. Mussels and clams showed up with a bunch of unopened ones. Service was a tad slow. Second time I've been underwhelmed by a ramsay restaurant. Pizza Antica in lafayette ca has better salad and mussels. Definitely not Hell's Kitchen craziness worthy.,1
Nice and friendly staff. The people were very in depth when they explained how it works. The line moved fast. The food was lite and did not just sit and your stomach and make you fell bad. It had a unique atmosphere that is busy but welcoming. Overall this place is one of the best places I have eat'n at.,2
"Tired of bad service! my husband and I just left this place. We were ignored for 15 min. Not even a cup of coffee or water, just a good morning from one of the staff. Honesty the owners should be looking this problem closely. I could not believe that is what they call service. Please acknowledge your customers!",1
Called for the House Special Fried Rice with chicken and shrimp and the BBQ Pork Fried Rice. Both sucked. I could feel the crunch of MSG on both. BBQ pork had no flavor zero . House Special Fried Rice was nothing but normal fried rice with chicken and shrimp. Nothing great about the ambience. Go only if you are craving for low grade asian food.,1
"Some of the best service I've experienced during my 5 day trip here. We had the short rib potstickers and kale dip for appetizers and each got fish as an entree. Very fresh, colorful, and with lots of good seasonings. The place is quite spacious which makes for quick seating even without a reservation. I enjoyed it and would certainly visit again.",2
"Food is reliably very good. The owners run the place and recognize regulars. Lots of vegetarian options, the food is authentically middle eastern. The humus and tabouli are excellent. If you bring your own plates, they will present your take out as if it were your own. The kabob are always good, get the garlic sauce for the chicken.",2
"Terrible pizza. Wings are ok. Asked for artichoke with chicken and mushroom. Got anchovies with chicken and mushroom. Customer service had trouble speaking English, which explains the problems. Crust was tough and pizza was cold when we picked up within timeframe. Wings were ok. I will not eat here again.",1
"Stay away! Room was nasty, toilet wouldn't flush, stank, tub was rusted, we could barely get in any tv channels and it kept going out, no choice of smoking or non smoking and absolutely disgusting and they wouldn't let us leave the parking garage with the parking pass bc nobody told us you must have your receipt which we threw away. Complete waste of time and . Go somewhere else.",1
"We came here on Thanksgiving night since after a whole day exploring The Strips we were exhausted and it's on the same floor as our suite. We were introduced to have rillette salmon for appetizer and lamb leg for entree. The Rillette was amazing. I have never had salmon in such form before, it's so smooth and creamy. We would love to come back again.",2
"I loved coming here on Saturdays for sex trivia. However, there is this one waiter that would always serve us that was completely rude, smart mouthed, and just an all around bad attitude. I was just in utter shock how a person that relies on tips for their living could be so rude. Since the last encounter with him, we haven't been back. It's a real shame because I really enjoyed hanging out there.",1
"L.O.V.E. I first stopped by on the Gallery Night, and was pleasantly surprised by the cute chic interior. Their tea selections are great if you're having trouble deciding, Anthony will expertly guide you to pick one. The second floor has lovely tatami mat traditional Japanese flooring seating areas that are perfect for a intimate date or a fun girl hang out.",2
Very good Thai food. The food is very high quality and is super tasty. The curries are great and the salads are fantastic. I've tried lots of items on the menu and have never been let down. My only complaint is that the portion sizes are a little small if you are really hungry. We've taken friends and family members to this place and everybody loves it.,2
"I lived near this place for two years and almost never bought anything. Eventually I just stopped going. This is the Goodwill that everybody goes to, so you're not going to find anything here. And I hate that they make you check all bags. Usually, I just walked past because inevitably I had a bag with me.",1
"I love this place! It's a small italian hide out. I have not tried the pizza yet, but man oh man the pasta dishes are good! I have been to pino's a couple of time just to feed my addiction to there sauce! Very nice staff truly a feel good place! nUpdate I have eaten here a dozen times and it is amazing every time!",2
I've been here multiple times and the customer service is consistently horrible! The people on the phone taking special orders are rude and I've showed up on several occasions after being told my pizza would be ready in 10 minutes to have to wait around another 10 cause they didn't start making it. Incompetent is a pretty good adjective for the people who work here.,1
"Vegas will always be competitive with abundance in food for cheap. Buffets everywhere, fancy places or just regular chain restaurants at you convenience ! This restaurant is a hidden place we found, We go back every time we visit Las Vegas ! It's a highlight of our trip every time! The fresh bread, the selection of omelets. Very reasonably priced! It's a must go !",2
THAT NIGHT IS STILL RINGING IN MY EARS one of the best experiences ive had going out had a great time even though it was crowded because of Halloween and ATB it was very fun and high energy all night the facility itself was very nice good sized dance floors and spas and pools galore cant say enough what a good night it was ,2
"A small but handy spot to get our lotto tix, pick up Redbox movie and get a car wash. It is small, 6 pump stations, but convenient. Attendants in my experience here have always been polite and professional. Parking lot and store inside tidy. The car wash is ""brushless "" so it saves wear on our paint job.great little convenience store gas car wash spot in Surprise!",2
"My wife and I pulled over the side of the road a few weeks ago trying to think of a place for dinner. We found Heirloom on Yelp! OMG.This is unique. The food is small tapas style plates in ala cart by the course. We went with a 9 course and ate plenty for two people. We shared. n The staff.exceptional, fun and really had passion for the restaurant. We are going back.with Groupons too.",2
I wonder which escaped convict is going to try to up sell me today. How hard is it to understand I only want an oil change. Everyone here had a neck tattoo. And don't even get me started on that guy that jumps on my hood looking for a crack in my windshield. This place is like the 9th ward of car washes.,1
"Not the worst food that I've ever had, but quite far from the best. It was greasy and my broccoli was cold. Mushrooms had an odd texture. I wouldn't eat there again if I had a choice. The orange chicken and fried rice were good, but I wouldn't recommend the noodles. They offer sushi. It looked like it has been there for days. They do have food other than the Chinese food.",1
"Awful service, period. Had initial round of cocktails, but then didn't see our server until the check was ready. Bacon was raw on my burger and when it was brought to the staff's attention, they said ""oh "" and walked away. We finally had to flag down a bus boy to bring us water. Check came to 81, and the server thought he did us a favor by comping a Coke. Puh lease.",1
"We order lunch from here regularly for over a year. It used to be great but the quality is really slipping over the last 6 months. Sometimes it is under cooked, sometimes the food is slimy. Overall it is very inconsistent. We keep ordering from here hoping it will be good again but it isn't. Also, they constantly say the food will be ready in 20 minutes and we have to wait there for an hour.",1
"Outdated, years of disgusting smell as if it's never been replaced nor cleaned, just very unpleasant! Yes I understand it's a gym and it's suppose to smell like sweat. Yes I understand it's one of the oldest LVACs. BUT the place needs some serious renovations! I will forever be faithful to the LVAC on Eastern 215. No matter how close this one is!",1
This place was a total surprise for me. I was not expecting much but really enjoyed the whole experience. The 3 d movie was fantastic and one of the best films made in 3 d I have ever seen. It was very serene to be in the butterfly garden and to see so many of them fluttering about. The aquariums and sting ray touch tank was a bonus!,2
"An outstanding view overlooking the Fremont Street Experience. I never would have expected the Chicken Salad Tapas to be the very best Chicken Salad I've ever had. For Dessert the Banana Nutella sandwiches. Highly recommended. But be warned, the ""Keep ordering "" nature of Tapas will drain your wallet dry and fast.",2
"Awful ambiance, so promising but the loud football game was in total contrast to the decor and setting. Music would have been much more appropriate. It was obvious no one in the part of the bar cared about the game, volume made conversation challenging. Over looking the lake it should have been a great experience, sadly not. Drinks were 5 star, but that is expected for the price.",1
"Terrible. Service was non existent, and the food was laughable. The civiche had shrimp that seemed like it was from a can, not fresh. Actually everything about the establishment seemed stale. My bf is from SoCal myself from Austin TX. Now locals in Vegas, and this was two thumbs way down. Go to Mundo instead!",1
"Buyer beware! literally The services provided aren't worth the extreme frustration caused by their inept billing, which is further compounded by illogical response from ownership. Find another therapy office that won't waste your time and make you regret ever trusting them with your personal information.",1
"There is only one reason why I would not give this place ""5 "" stars. It's only because they should reconsider naming the place ""Grandma's B!t hin' nThe food is really good but the owner likes to come around and complain about past customers while you eat. It's kind of off putting. Otherwise, everyone is really nice. The atmosphere is more than pleasant and you can't beat the breakfast.",2
"Ordered the 7 course tasting menu. Excellent flavors and impeccable service. My husband had the 5 course tasting menu. Great view, Nice wine selection.had Chardonnay and Malbec. Good choices. Good idea for watermelon pairing with heirloom tomatoes and balsamic vinegar. Duck breast and spicy quinoa was a good pairing. Loved the poached pear. Beautiful plating and dish selections.",2
"I'm pleased to say, I've been seeing Michelle and Dr. Roderick for nearly 10 years, and I've never had a bad experience. Michelle is quick, and thorough, a true professional! Dr. Roderick takes the time to explain tough procedures in simple terms so you feel comfortable with what they need to do. They're not close to my home or work, but worth the drive. I'd recommend them to anyone.",2
"This place is crazy inspiring and Leonardo is a great accent to the shop. Even if you don't know what you are looking for, this shop is filled with pieces that will revive your creativity. Very professional and welcoming, bring your open mind and be prepared to be blown away by the artwork, furniture and vibe.",2
"This is the church where all the cool people go! I knew there had to be one some where. My family has been attendending Verve for a while now and it is totaly awsome, so if you are ready to come to a church where you can feel totaly free, not be judged by anyone, and rock out with some total cool people you need to get down there on a Sunday morning or Monday night.",2
"I wish this place was a drive through instead of in a mall. I only do take out on my way to work. And the ""10 minute food take out "" spots a full half the time with people who do not have regard for the sign. Getting take out at Sarku usually take 7 10 minutes if they don't have any ready when you have walk up to order. But this stuff is like crack",2
"PROS It can be cheap taco platter for 8, burrito platter for 9. Plenty of vegetarian selection. Food is reasonably edible. CONS Average americo mexican food, a horrible beer selection especially considering what Montreal has to offer , and staff who can't even act like they care. Don't bother asking for even the simplest substitution.",1
Okay I will admit a Greggs sausage roll is up there with Irn Bru and McDonald's as a brilliant hangover cure. But that's it. Greggs is where 17 year old mums take their many children to feed them with sausage rolls and Coca Cola. Here's a thought fruit! Vegetables! Try feeding them to your child instead of Greggs processed fatty food. Rant over.,1
"Bad service, bad cars, not recommended. Three sleepy mumbling representatives behind the counter and an exceedingly long line that is not moving. Finally I get a car whose wheels go cloink clink clunk so I didn't dare to go anywhere with it. I exchange it for a car that has no functioning outlet so I can't even use my GPS. Total failure.",1
"Great, friendly service and very tasty, unique rolls. Lots of ponzu which they do wonderfully. Everyone must try the Justin special, such a fabulous, light and tasty roll. It's almost like a sushi salad. nMy only complaint is their eel. It's fishy and just not the best. Which is disappointing because I love eel. But despite that this is our sushi place that we go to over and over and over again.",2
I really need to appreciate the fact that this amazing place is so close to home! The cider is outstanding! The owners are great and you can really tell that this place is their passion. I love that they sell cider by the glass now. It's the perfect meeting place for a drink and a snack you can bring your own . The outdoor patio is a beautiful addition. A great place take out of town friends.,2
"This is my wife and my go to place when we come to Las Vegas. It gets busy and full, but not full enough you have to wait. There is romantic indoor seating, or a nice outdoor patio seating that allows for people watching. Food is ALWAYS good. No matter what you order you will not be disappointed. Service is on point as well. We absolutely cannot say enough good things about this place!",2
"After a friend of mine put his iPhone through the washing machine, Vinnie was able to get it working like new within a day. He was polite, professional, and great at his job. My friend's iPhone is working perfectly, and is in great condition. I would recommend them to anyone having cell phone issues.",2
"Hey.you looking for a good bakery? You want a good pastry or two? You want a cinnamon bun, or a garlicy corn bread muffin, or a yummy cookie? This is the place for you! Oh hell yeah! I would come here again in a heart beat. here is the thing, though. They don't have bread here. So don't come looking for a baguette!",2
"We went back here the other weekend, and I have to say that I like it more and more each time I go. Others in our party felt the exact same way. The food is nothing extraordinary, but it's solidly good. The atmosphere is great. And, finally, I can confirm that their bloody marys are delicious. I am glad to see this place downtown and doing well, and I plan to come back again and again.",2
"Unfortunately I echo most of the reviews here. Their gas prices are astronomical compared to competition, 0.40 higher than most other stations. Unfortunately there is only one gas station at Carefree and I 17 which I am assuming is why they are so anti competitive, which hopefully one day will end. I actively avoid getting gas here for this reason.",1
"Two stars for poor customer service. It doesn't matter how good your donuts are, you probably shouldn't ask a pregnant lady if she should be drinking coffee. It's none of your business and quite rude. For the record, everything is okay in moderation, including donuts and a little iced coffee! I told my husband we won't be coming back here.",1
"My husband and I came here for a date night. The food was excellent, the drinks were good, and service was wonderful. I loved the ambiance! It was a little pricey, but worth it. We sat next to the fireplace on a cold, rainy evening so our table was VERY romantic. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're celebrating a birthday or anniversary!",2
