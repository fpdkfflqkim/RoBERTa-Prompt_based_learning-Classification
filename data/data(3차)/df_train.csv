"Good food. Unfortunately or fortunately for us , we sniffed out a scam. Check your bills. They overcharged us by 100. After we alerted the cashier to the mistake, we were offered a shoddy explanation that would leave even the most trusting soul saying ""hmmmmm "". I surmise there is a rotten apple amongst the staff. Overall, good food. Nice people. .But something smells funny.",1
"We sat at the bar for some dinner. There were only a few people there, yet it took forever to get anything. The bartender was friendly, but was not happy she had to be. The food is blah. I had the potato stuffed with ham, bacon and cheese. It was a large portion, but the flavor was bland. My friend eating with me had a similar experience.",1
"Horrible food and service! It took over an hour to get our food and it was not even busy. On top of that, our waitress seemed bothered by having to serve us. I ordered the Asada and chicken enchiladas, which were far too salty. My dad ordered the birria, which he also thought was too salty and greasy. I would not recommend this place.",1
"The pizza here is terrible and the staff was unbelievably, weirdly aloof and rude. I'm not sure they even realize that they work in a restaurant, that we are your guests and are paying to have a good experience and have fun. No wonder the place was empty. Go back to New York and take your coal with you.",1
" 17 pp just to get inside. NO phones or cameras allowed inside! Drinks are VERY small one shot and are 10 a piece. If you're here it's definitely for the ""experience "" of saying you were here. They have a photog who will take pics inside.then try to upsell you as you leave for 20 a piece. I won't be back.",1
This place sucks now. The best part was that their happy hour was so good. Guess what! Now they make you order food. Any bar in Vegas that stipulates your drinking with rules should be shut down. Don't go here and never support them. They need to get their full happy hour back or shut down. Go to echo and rig we just had dinner there which is why we are not hungry and they were so good.,1
 ATTENTION Very horrible customer service. They do not have mirrors anywhere but the nasty bathroom. And when you cancel in the beginning of the month. They don't credit you for the month you paid for even if you haven't and won't be using it. Horrible place. I recommend nobody tan at this dirty place.,1
"We went there for lunch for the AYCE. The rice on the nigiri's is way too much, but then again, I didn't see any Japanese cooks making them, so I can't blame them if they don't know what they are doing. No matter how nice the servers are, the food needs to be good for me to return. Not my favorite place.",1
Heard good things about this place so when we got to Vegas we stopped here. Well don't waste your money! It's about 40 a person! Very overpriced! There isn't a real big selection of food. I've had better. Basically your paying for the unlimited beer n wine. Quality of food n meat are low grade too . Meat was tough! If your Gona spend this amount of money go to bellagios buffet.,1
"We were staying at the hotel and decided to eat at the restaurant in house. Menu was over priced, dinning room was loud and our food just OK. We ordered Salmon very small dish , corn didnt care for it much , lamb meat balls were just OK, and seafood chowder was not as good as I expected. All in all, just an OK place to eat.",1
"By far the worst club I've been to, that fact that we had a table reserved but we've been waiting in line for over and hour is beyond frustrating, the last club I would recommend, while the bouncers are taking top dollar to allow people or pretty women in on the side, people that have been waiting to get in are left waiting, other then the dj, I wasn't too entertained.",1
"When you call for reservation they try to upsell with resort club.now when you there using it the person who works at the 24th floor where you get the snacks and drinks , the person who works there is giving the customers a hard time to get in the place.been going there for the past couple of years seems like the services is getting less and less the past couple of years",1
"Don't do it! We were ignored after we sat at a table so my husband went to the bar to get me a ice tea. The bartender refused to help him. When he told him we were sitting in the corner he said ""you're in the black hole I can't help you "". Go to the food court. The menu was very limited at this restaurant anyway. Don't waste your time.",1
"The new set up is terrible. The old stand under the trees was great. The new stand in the middle of the compost is terrible. It smelled liked I was shopping for food at the dump. The ambiance carried this place in the past and somewhat justified the high prices, but I will definitely not go out of my way to experience the dirt and dust pile that you have created now.",1
I was so excited to get custard while in the Vegas area because I have had it at a few places in the midwest. I thought all places made it relatively the same. WRONG. I ordered a chocolate concrete here and it was not chocolate ey and had a bitter after taste. Everyone saying that it's so good obviously hasn't had custard anywhere else.,1
"I was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed! Everything was bland, nothing had seasoning, not even basic salt. Soggy fries, tasteless meat, average coleslaw on white bread trying to double for Italian bread. Save your time, money and calories and go to Wendy's instead.",1
"don't ever pay the typical 50 a nite they want. this place is worth 10 nite tops. it's a trucker casino hotel. run down, nasty rooms. scary folk stay here. i've stayed here at least twice cos of my weirdo bud. i'm dirtbag chic, but this is silly. too expensive . plenty of lot lizards trying to blow ya fer a 10 spot. alright casino. very nice cool staff.",1
"Dinner for four. Had reservations and did not get table asked for. Tortilla so u00fbp.not so great. The Cobb salad with beef tenderloin.salad good, but tenderloin was stringy trim pieces, it appeared. Pretty disappointed. Noisy as usual. Not much that can be done about that. Love the way the restaurant is decorated. Not sure we'll be back. Disappointing.",1
"OVERPRICED! Awful service and the food was so so at best, in fact my daughter got sick on the ride back to the hotel from the Sheppard's pie. I ordered the BLT because I heard it was the only thing on the menu that was good. to be fair it was, but not good enough to justify the price. Gordon Ramsay should yell at himself for how bad this place is.",1
I am not against national chains and I like the convenience of a CVS always being nearby where I am. The Middleton store however is not up to par with the other CVS stores I have experienced. Seemingly lazy staff with poor attitudes are the norm rather than the exception. If you can you another location I would. CVS in other locations has been great.,1
"I stayed in the older part of the hotel and it was. pretty OLD. The air conditioning wasn't working well but we hardly stayed in the room so it wasn't too bad for the price. nThe location is really good, the rooms were clean and the pool is nice. nIf you don't want anything really fancy this one is fine.",1
"Hired to repair a rock chip in windshield. Always free via insurance. Rep tried to charge 50 deductible. Interesting thing is the invoice and purchase order was already drawn up at 65 to bill insurance only. One of two conclusions 1. Disorganized billing and tracking system that overcharges customers. 2. Attempt to scam customers. Either way, not acceptable. Would not recommend.",1
"This is an extremely smoky bar with terrible music. The atmosphere is not there, the music is so low that no one really talks. The food is just ok and the service is very mediocre. The crowd is in their 50's so their is not much action as most people are gambling. This bar needs a major facelift! I would probably not recommend it to anyone as there are better places to experience",1
Went back to this place to give it another shot. Service still sucks. You have to know the owners or workers in order to get decent service. The place wasn't busy and the table behind us was getting constant attention while our table was neglected. The server didnt even check on us. And I'm Korean. The food is good enough to go back but shitty service really turns me off.,1
"Maybe it's because I came here late at night when things had been sitting out for a while, but the pastries here really weren't that good. I got the cherry cake slice, which had flavor, but was pretty dry. I also got the black sesame bun, which was also pretty dry. Overall, not something worth raving about.",1
"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE FIRST THEY STOLE THE 75 cent that I was going to fill up my water jugs, then they told me they topped off my fluids which they did not my car almost OVERHEATED and now my radio plays softly even though my car is totally off. All I went there for was an oil change, that was all. WTF!",1
"This place is good.if you've never had thai food in your life before. To top off the high prices of this place, i ordered the beef salad and the meat was extremely dry and tasteless, the crab fried rice tasted like something i could make at home with rice egg and crab meat, no additional flavor what so ever. Go to archis or surangs if you're in the neighborhood. Or better yet KING AND I",1
"I've been here a few times in the past. It was decent food, quick and easy for a school night. However, the last time I went here will be the last the last time I ever go again! I took an order of the chips and salsa to go. About half of the container of salsa gone. I notice a broken rubber band floating in it. Absolutely disgusting! Nope! Nah uh never again. Don't eat here people.",1
"Saw show on March 1,2014. Pretty cheap for a show in Vegas, so I am more concerned over the waste of my time than the waste of my money. First two comedians were average, but I Literally had trouble staying awake during the last comedian! Burlesque dancers both of them were even less entertaining. Don't waste your time!",1
"These people promise you the world, take a lot of your money, give you a few shots of pop psychology, nothing more. They have no credentials, but they're just so sure they can help, just as soon as you fork over a few grand. One thing they do very well is brainwash people into doing their bidding, so no doubt this thread will soon be full of zombies raving about how great they are.",1
"Oh goodness, where to begin? 40 minute wait for outdoor seating. Dried food. The chicken literally had a helmet shell. My friend couldn't cut into it. My chicken was also dry. The flavors really are all wrong. The only redeeming quality is that the staff is uber nice. So, I would say just fix up the kitchen, or go here if all you want is a wide selection of beer.",1
"If you enjoy microscopic mediocre hot dogs, then this place is for you. Costco's hot dogs are better and sell some called ""Caspers, "" that will rock your world. I'm shocked this place is still in business with the crappy product they are selling. A normal sized bun with an anorexic hot dog in the middle. Save your money and go anywhere else.",1
"Skip this place and go to Texas de Brazil! The food is mediocre and the quality of the meat here is not the best. The hot good in the salad bar area left a lot to desire. nIf you pay extra for the seafood option you will regret it. We were with a large party and the waiter received at least 400 tip, way too much for the service he provided. Won't be back.",1
I haven't been here since 2012. Said the only thing I would go back for is the shredded beef tacos. Well nothing has changed food is lousy and staff is rude.I can't believe all the 4 and 5 star ratings for this place. This use to be one of the best Mexican food places in town. My family has come here since the 60's.,1
"They move like sloths here. Little respect for your time. Had to repeat myself 3 times. Also, they printed my order in color when I asked for black and white and instead of just giving me color they wasted 49 more pages changing it to black and white making copies and not printing which lowered the quality. 2 stars because they're decent guys, just not stoked to work here.",1
"People who said this is one of the best steak house they ever had. Obviously doesn't know better, coming from a gal who eats everywhere in vegas this place is mediocre. Oh and the girls dancing or dusting in middle of the dinnig area!? dunno if that helps either it's not tacky but it's just silly. I want good steak and fat foie gras Michael Mina and Gordon Ramsey steak",1
"I've been there several times and the young woman who gave me a pedicure was really good. However the last time I went, the shop was generally messy, so I looked closer. There was a lot of accumulated dirt and dust behind the spa chairs. Cleanliness is very important to me especially with any kind of body work, so I won't go back there.",1
"Today, Nov. 25, 2013, is not quite good. Staff is not well trained doing or preparing paper works. She needs more training I hope. Before you call the patient, please double check your paper works. It's tiring to wait and we were exhausted. My husband was very tired. He did not eat all night and day. It is very disappointing today.",1
"Some one explain to me why the outside patio is closed until 4 30pm? Nice sunny 70 degree day lots of street traffic and the patio is closed until the sun goes down? Emerald do you have any idea what these idiots are doing at this place? And snot nosed about it too. And i was not alone about this, this past friday afternoon check the tapes.",1
"Terrible and high priced food. Mean manager. Had a 8 hot dog. Got to taste good, right? Wrong! After drinking my 5 latte I feel thirsty so I ask for a little hot water. Guess what, the manager asked me for 75c. ""it's just 75c! "" she said. I walked away and would never go back. If you like high priced low quality food plus poor service, go for it!",1
"The only star to give this place is because of the pool. When you have a large group of 60, this place was perfect because we were able to all have a lounge chair and not have to pay for a cabana. There was a lot of room. Otherwise, I wish you well in getting good customer service and a good room. I think they will be out of business in a few years.",1
Friday nights are Sonic Sunday nights . I have never had a problem until tonight when we ordered our 3 Sundays and got home and had to clean my car. They not only didn't put the tops on all the way but it was melted like it had either been sitting on the counter for someone to order it or their ice cream machine was broken. It went everywhere . I am not a happy camper !,1
"Keeping this short and sweet. The sushi rice was a little more compacted than I would like, all the rolls sound the same with the ingredients listed in varying orders to sound different. Wait time was longer than expected for the food. If you come here.perhaps try the hibachi.but if you are hard core on Japanese food. than this isn't a spot for you!",1
I called and scheduled my appointment on April 7 for service this morning. Called and left 6 messages during the week to confirm. Phone was never answered and calls were never returned. Obviously they did not show up today. Now the answering machine isn't even picking up. Will be contacting living social for a refund but have had problems with them too.,1
"Its just not good. Plain and simple. If I was at a homeless shelter and this was the food of the day, yes, I would eat it. Other than that, save your 6 and go to.anywhere else! Why is there 20 people working and they can't get a simple burger right? Makes no sense. And I figured it out.the music is loud as hell so you can't hear people complaining!",1
"Horrible! We waited over 35 minutes and counted 7 Thrifty, 5 Budget, 3 Hertz and then we stopped counting. When we called the number they said the couldn't call the shuttle driver without a confirmatioumber.absolutely pitiful. Vacation time is way to precious to be jacked around by a rental car company.",1
"Forget trying to have meals or drinks at any of the patio dining with all the cars rushing by. The exhaust, engine noise and music so loud in alot of the cars as they drive by is ridiculous. They could have at least put in speed humps or something similar to slow the cars down. Most won't even attempt to stop for pedestrians in the few crosswalks installed.",1
"I would have said ""Go for a drink and the view', but Vegas now has so many other options for amazing views. Had dinner here twice, and both times were mediocre. Thought it would be better because I am a huge fan of Alain Ducasse, but Mix just doesn't cut it. The decor is beautiful and the staff is very friendly. For the price, much better dining options in Sin City.",1
You would think with a name like this they would have homemade quality pita. Not so. Do you like cardboard? Do you like loud? Do you like NO protein? Then this is the place for you. Won't go back. When I asked about the Pita the manager told me that corporate can't decide on a recipe. Give me a break. Don't go.,1
"I absolutely hated this restaurant. We were staying at The Palms and arrived at the restaurant without a reservation I know the nerve huh. We were traeted so poorly by the hostess I just wanted out of there however, my friends wanted to stay. The waitress was just as bad as the hostess rude rude rude. The food was overpriced and not very tasty.",1
"Im a night perso so are all my buddies. We go here after the gym n just chill, eat, drink, vape etc. The food here is awesome! Its a really chill atmosphere which I really like! Eric is the best bartender. Hes awesome! Always on top of everything and always recommending really good food. He has awesome stories too. Really cool guy! Keep it up boss! Montana meat company is awesome!",2
"I went here because my boyfriends best friend works here, I was a bit skeptical because I'm typical not a fan of assembly line restaurants. It was amazing! We got the spicy southwest salad and veggie pizza. The salad was spicy, fresh and hearty. The veggie pizza was very tasty. And the service was great!",2
Love this place it is a 7 mile trip for us and worth the ride. Have been going here for 6 mo now. We have never had any thing that wasn't great.Friendly Service they are right on top of it from taking your order to the delivery. The best cannoli in town. My wife is a Italian and swears by there food. The girls that work there are very nice and always smiling. We highly recommend this restaurant.,2
"I am always pleased when I go to BJ's. Food and service is always excellent. I gave it a four star instead of a five star because of the way they changed how they bring the pizza out. It used to come out in a pan but now comes out on a plate. The result being it not as hot and crispy, still good but not as great as it used to be.",2
"This is one of the better steaks I've eaten. I ordered the filet mignon, and the meat was so tender that the name is really appropriate. Also a plus that you can mix what kind of sauce and vegetables you want yourself. The downside was the price on the restaurant which was kinda expensive. Also we had to wait some time to get our food, but this was accepted since we were a party of 17!",2
"Tried the pumpkin bars everyone is raving about, and I totally get it now. I say this even as a non pumpkin pie fan. Very cute shop, very good service. I hope more people catch on to this little hidden gem and support more small businesses! Keep it up! I will be ordering my bars for Thanksgiving and maybe a few more deliciousness I eyed.",2
"Excellent food. We both got the potatoe chip encrusted pork chop, with homemade applesauce, and bacon macaroni and cheese. The food is the most important aspect of a restaurant's offerings and they did a great job. The building is not the most beautiful, but is perfect for the price. Exactly as advertised, great service and great food.",2
My family and I had a great time riding the High Roller! We arrived at 2 pm on a weekday and bought our tickets with a locals discount at the box office and were able to walk right onto a pod all to ourselves without waiting in line. The views were incredible and I would highly recommend taking a ride!,2
Todd replaced the worn out keys and fixed the cylinder in the ignition of my Honda Odyssey. Dropped the van off and he was done with it by the end of the day. nAnother locksmith I had called previously referred me to Todd at Alcatraz Locksmith. He said that Todd was the local expert in automotive locks.,2
A wonderful experience every time I visit! Their level of professionalism is unmatched in the service industry. The talent is amazing and Noah is an absolute gem! The care and courtesy shown to clients is fantastic and I would recommend Salon Ro 5 to everyone who cares about their locks! Thank you for the continued exquisite hair care !,2
"Ermahgerd, it's Taco Tuesday!. Monday, and Wednesday. Genuine soft or hard taco's with corn tortillas for a buck, three days out of the week? I'm sold! I tried the shredded beef, the ground beef, as well as the chicken tacos. they were amazing! And if you are more a fan of street tacos, they got those too. maybe next review i will talk about their burritos.",2
"All sandwiches are 5.99. I got the Caribbean Jerk Chicken. I thought it would come out a little sweet, but it was more like a tangy no complaints though! Had peppercinis and this spicy sauce on very moist chicken. Went VERY well together! Yum! Good place for some late night grubbing. PS don't share the sandwich. It won't be enough for two! Learned the hard way T",2
"Finally a ""fast food "" place that doesn't serve meals full of trans fatt, sodium and sugar! I call those the 3 devils. I had the French Quarter and loved it! It was full of flavor and the right portion size. As a former nurse, and current personal trainer I a, so glad to see this restaurant some to Scottsdale! The service was very friendly, and place was very clean. I will go back!",2
"Absolutely delicious and my favorite place in town. This meal Is always two hours long though, service is extremely slow no matter which server you get. One of my top request is don't starve my thirst and refills are hard to come by. Food makes up for the slow service, be sure to check out the coupons in the newspapers and weekly adds.",2
"Beltmann group was amazing! I have never used professional movers before. I have moved 30 times and considered myself an expert mover! They proved me wrong. From packing, loading, and hauling to unloading I could not have been more impressed! I had no worries about my belongings! Our driver, Greg, and Dylan were wonderful! Kept me updated and so patient with us! Loved our experience with Beltmann!",2
"I wore fake eyelashes every single day until a friend told me about Cherry Lash Lounge. I LOVE it. I love just waking up in the morning with beautiful long thick lashes. I never feel like I need to do my makeup anymore and I can get ready so fast. You can't see them glued on, they look almost natural. I wouldn't ever switch!",2
"Cool new bar down Advocates Close! I love the look and feel of the place. It looks like it has lots of potential so I'll look forward to going back again on a weekend night, or day. An exciting new bar to go to in the Old Town. From the sounds of it they're going to be opening up mega early for breakfast so I'll have to try it sometime.",2
"We came here after seeing it on triple D. The food and service was awesome! We had a Stromboli and a meatball sub. Both has amazing flavor and were relatively cheap. The two of us ate with an appetizer for and beer for 25 bucks. Also, we took home left overs. The place is a definite dive bar, but well worth the 10 minute drive off the strip.",2
"This is one of my favorite spot to grab some clothes for the gym or work. I like the sales they have and it's usually pretty quiet so shopping is a breeze. Sometimes you can find good deals on the kitchen appliances as well, like the blenders for my protein shakes. The only thing I don't like about kohl's is getting hassled for a credit card every time I go here.",2
"Yeah, I'm thinking there is going to be a lot more of this place in my future. I finally tried that elusive egg salad only served for one hour. Incredible. I truly believe eggs are the perfect food. I also believe I might be addicted to food considering I am writing this update solely for an egg salad sandwich. Send help.",2
"I really liked the atmosphere in this place, plus they had a great football game while we ate, but the overall burger experience was ok. It was like a mexican version of smash burger. Long wait time, GREAT smell. I would have liked more smokey flavor in the actual burger, but all in all it was really good. Oh, and I recommend a crap load of napkins because it's ridiculously messy.",2
"The actual best kept secret in Gilbert. This place is pretty hidden, but don't let that stop you. As a barista, I can confidently say that HG has the highest quality specialty coffee in this part of the valley. Not to mention, the nicest employees and a completely relaxed environment. 5 stars for Higher Grounds!",2
"Best tacos I've had in Vegas. The pork tacos cured my slight hangover. I also was deprived from sleep, only slept 3 hours, and after stuffing my mouth with these mouth watering tacos instantaneously my soul was lifted. Cured my hangover and also gave me the energy needed to overcome another day of partying. Definitely worthy of five stars!",2
"Wir waren schon zweimal da und das nicht ohne Grund! Die Zimmer sind gro u00df und modern, und das Bad teilweise mit Aussenfenster, neu und sauber ! Der Hammer ist das Fr u00fchst u00fcck! Riesen Auswahl an Leckereien und das Ganze f u00fcr wenig Geld alleine wegen dem Fr u00fchst u00fcck lohnt sich der Besuch im Rio! nNix Fake es ist einfach so!",2
"The sauce, toast, and chicken were awesome. I love how the strips were not long and thin but were thick and juicy. The fries reminded me of the fries you got in elementary school cooked by an oven. not great. The house sauce went really well with the chicken and fries though. I want to go back again tonight but my gf is being wack.",2
"I absolutely adore Su Vino! I've taken friends there a few times and everyone finds something they enjoy, whether your taste is white or red. The ambiance is lovely, the wine is great and the service is fantastic friendly, attentive, patient they make great recommendations ! Great place for a first date or just to meet up with the girls!",2
My husband and I stopped by for a quick to go order of spring rolls and french style iced coffee. Loved it. The coffee was way bigger than I expected and super strong. My husband got his beloved spring rolls and told me they were the best he'd ever had and big to boot. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.,2
"My AC died on the 10 on my way back to LA when it was 110 degrees outside. Desperate I fired up yelp and found this place, they squeezed me in before end of day, we're totally up front about everything and took care of everything. While it sucked to have AC bust crap out in the summer heat of Phoenix, glad it happened near these guys!",2
"Had dinner at Little Cleo's last week while visiting friends in Phoenix. What a find! Great food, great service and reasonably priced to boot! The grilled octopus starter is really tasty.and the fresh oyster selection is the best I've found south of Seattle! A great restaurant experience, and I'll definitely go back on my next trip south. Absolutely 5 stars!",2
"We've used Eco Fresh twice now and would definitely recommend this company to friends and family. We moved to a new place where the carpets were covered in dog hair and odor, but Eco Fresh was able to clean it all out. The carpets are a million times cleaner and brighter! Luigi who did our carpets both times was very friendly and gave us great customer service too. Thanks again!",2
Really great all around good reliable restaurant.food very good good servce.in particular our waitress was so tolerant with us as we waited for a very late friend who was meeting us.we sat on patio and took the table for quite a bit.she was very nice about it.we all had breakfast and every bite was a pleasure.,2
"Found this small restaurant on yelp. Wow! The food is amazing, the service great! It is a small place. We waited for over 30 minutes. Well worth the wait. The Pork Chop, Baked Eggplant, and Chix Parm. Wow! Will be back. We do not want to for get the Cheesecake. This place is a hidden treasure Off The Strip.",2
"We were in town on business and decided to book our stay here because we have a Hilton Rewards account. We couldn't have been happier. When we arrived we were offered a room upgrade for almost no charge. The room was HUGE over 1.400 square feet . It had a jacuzzi, a washer dryer and a projection screen which turned an entire wall into your TV! Just an awesome experience!",2
"Being that My wifey is from Germany, we were looking for a place that may carry some of her favorite treats and delights from Deutschland. They did not fail to impress. They carried her favorite cake mix, candy, soups and pastas. well worth the membership money for the year. I definitely love this place.",2
"Just got back from the comedy show at Standup Scottsdale. We saw Vince Morris! What a great show! Hubby and I laughed until we cried and my stomach muscles were hurting. We ended up being part of the show and the crowd was chanting my name. Too funny! If you ever get a chance to see him, you should! And we got to see the show for free!",2
"I have been here many times for meetings, conferences and events. The meeting space is nice, with great views in the main conference room. The banquet staff is always helpful I did, however, come across one server that was less pleased with her job. I wont blame the country club for her actions though. I would recommend this meeting space to anyone.",2
"Best thing about this place is that it's so close to my house! Other than that they are well priced 18 pedicure and more or less I am always satisfied with the work. It is clean and net, massage chairs, TV, magazines . you won't be bored. They had few new employees that did not impress me, but I still keep coming back. If you're in the area, I would recommend going!",2
"A beautiful and peaceful place. They have a beautiful bird display and lots of flowers. This place is full of color and brightness. For a moment I was very impressed with how the flowers were arranged until I realized most, if not all are simply still in their pots instead of actually planted. Despite this, it's very beautiful place to check out.",2
"When I think of the department stores that I like, I think Lord Taylor and Nordstrom.but I have bought a few appliances from Sears lately and have been very, very happy. The selection is huge, prices are fair and delivery is timely and efficient. I've bought 2 washing machines and one dryer, and presumably they came from this store.",2
"Great price, Jr Suite corner room, view of the strip and mountains nwonderful bed do wish we had taken the name of the mattress. Only issue was the noisy vent in the bathroom, but with both doors closed we didn't really hear it after a night out. We chose the Elara for the non smoking and appliances, very pleased with the security, all the staff pleasant and efficient. We enjoyed our 3 night stay.",2
"Good coffee, great cold brew. I love walking down there from the ASU downtown campus. It's a nice break, and few students frequent it. The only thing I don't like about it is the seating. It's not super comfy and not conducive to conversations. That said, I'm mostly a grab and go kinda person with coffee.",2
"Its a hole in the wall, so if you need to sit is a fancy new looking chain place, then this may not be for you. But if you can live with an out dated building, this place has the most amazing food! Seriously i think they use Angel meat in these sandwiches because i have never had a better Philly in AZ.",2
"The kind of place I love! Great coffee options Kickapoo, Intelligentsia and inspired food menu. Coffee house meets knitters united but you can chill out in this rustic house turned coffee meet up and enjoy locally sourced menu. We enjoyed the coffee and lattes and an amazing hot panini style caprese sandwich.",2
"I'm involved with a large non profit organization. We had one of our team meetings here. The food was excellent, and good happy hour specials as well. I had a salad, which came in this amazing bread bowl. The manager was so awesome and brought us out some desserts to try which were to die for! I'm looking forward to returning here in the near future.",2
"I was craving a smoothie and have heard good things about Paradise Juice, so I stopped in the other day and got an oasis I think smoothie. You can tell the ingredients are fresher than places like Jamba Juice just by seeing all the fresh juices and cut up fruit on the counter. My smoothie was very good, I'll be back to try more.",2
"This Walgreens is in The Venetian and it's bigger than your typical Walgreens. They have a lot more goods and it's a lot bigger. I really liked that they had souvenirs at a price cheaper than most places. I got a baby Las Vegas t shirt dress one piece for my daughter. I also got her a stuffed monkey. And, I got a Las Vegas cup with straw, which seems to be a things these days, for my wife.",2
"i really, really like this place not just because it's right by my house and it's NOT starbucks, but those things certainly don't hurt. i love that they have a drive thru. i love that the staff are genuinely nice people. i love their tiny little nicely decorated seating area. and, most importantly, i love their tasty, reasonably priced coffee.",2
"This place is awesome. The food is delicious, the service is outstanding, and the prices are very reasonable. I wish we lived closer to it, but as it is we make an effort to come here when we are in town every year for Spring Training. The stews in particular have a unique depth of flavor. I highly recommend that everyone check this place out and see for themselves what a great spot it is!",2
Brad Garrett is hysterical and if you are old you might pee your pants. I thought one of the other two comedians was funny too. They don't make you buy drinks like at most places. We purchased some wine and it wasn't awful but it wasn't good either it was just drinkable. They add the tip on so you don't have too. The only food they sell is pre made pop corn.,2
"This was another great Yelp find. Very friendly and quick service keeps this local breakfast restaurant moving smoothly. The food was great, no bad surprises. The banana but muffins have a great flavor, but the texture could be improved upon. Great eggs, good chorizo, fresh fruit was sweet and hash was good too. Great place for a simple but tasty breakfast!",2
