The restaurant was really over priced and it was very bad quality too. 30 for a small plate of fatty galbie short ribs . Don't bother buying the seafood pancake. It was thick dough and no seafood. It costed 16! The soft tofu soup tasted like water no seasoning! The only positive point was it was clean. Come here if you want to get ripped off and unsatisfied.,1
"What a joke, they don't care about what they serve. If I wanted crapy Sushi, I will buy it at Trader Joe's or Fry's. They have no pride in what comes on your plate. Sad really lie some said there is not much out that way butI will drive to Scottsdale, so I can have some good sushi. Best thing is to STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY!",1
"I had the mellow mushroom burger and it was so flavorful! It also came with a ton of food. The burger and fries were terrific, and if you get anything there, you MUST get it with the icy lemonade. You get one free refill of the icy lemonade and it is fantastic! Well worth the money and its atmosphere reflects the vibe of ""two hippies "" having a ""beach house.'",2
"I have been going here for YEARS now and not once has it EVER disappointed me! I always get ALL YOU CAN EAT because not only is it fairly priced but you can do 1 2 rolls as well. I haven't had a bad thing on their menu. I highly recommend Yama and I also recommend the ""Happy Ending "" roll. You can thank me later. I hope they will eventually make their spot bigger!",2
"We wanted to like this place, we tried to like it, we just couldn't. As ordinary as the wings were, the service was even worse. The servers either travelled in herds or were invisible, but either way they seemed to ignore us. Some of the other food was pretty good, but when wings are in your name, you expect a lot.",1
"Our first visit was lunch time mid week and the brisket and charbroiled beef were supreme. Our second was in the evening it was good, but the sandwiches didn't pack the same punch. Perhaps the LOVE day time Mr. Sandwich has for his creations isn't so much shared by nite time Mr. Sandwich? Please help nite time Mr. Sandwich find his mojo!",2
"I'm not sure how, but after going back, it was even worse. I should have stuck to my guns and not given them a second chance. The service was empty and the rolls were just full of rice. The fish is not fresh that's kind of important in Sushi. AVOID THIS PLACE. I also heard the owner is pumping up some of these good reviews? nNOW IT DOESN'T MATTER THEY CLOSED",1
"Don't let the outside fool you. Inside is an awesome decor and atmosphere. Much more elegant than other sushi restaurants. Food is great and awesome. Had the all you can eat great value. Staff very friendly, and kind. Service was moderately quick. Go there in the early hours of meal time to get the best service times. nWARNING don't order too much of the rolls they have huge servings.",2
Everytime I go to this store they are always out of stock on what I want to buy such as blank DVD media. They never carry the items on sale. I only go here since it is close to my work but that changed after the 2nd time I went here and left with out what I came for. If you do plan on going to this location have low expectations.,1
"First time here last weekend for a Niner Vs Bronco game. Great staff, great service, great prices on pitchers and they have a 2 menu. They also make game watching even more entertaining with the raffle tickets they give out for every touchdown the Broncos make. Oh and the Karaoke after the game was fun too! ",2
"Not impressed. Food was terrible. Did not feel me up. Cheap, however for what ur getting, its not wrth it. Wat mexican place dont have asada. Oh thats right this place. This is the 2nd time I came here, and what a disappointment. I will be surprised if there around much longer! Just terrible food. Wood not recommend!",1
"I said I would give this place another shot, and I'm glad I did. The food was not only fantastic, the service was a night and day difference from the last time I came. This is not a lazy man's restaurant It takes work. It's well worth it too, although, I could use less tourists next time I come, but hey, it's good for business.",2
"Great little gem! The portions are reasonable, the food is very flavorful, and cheap! The service is very homely and efficient. The babaganus as spelled on their menu is superb! Pretty good coffee, and great tea. The baklava is delicious here as well. I cannot wait to go back, definitely a great place to check out!",2
"Place has the weirdest foods which makes it harder to order something DECENT. And the lady that calls up the party's for their table is one of those very rude employees that scream in a rude tone. And on the way out I within a couple feet and she screamed ""mike party for 5 "" and I almost went deaf. And floor is oldish and weird decor.",1
"O M G. I love French cuisine and haven't really found a good French restaurant here in AZ, but this is now one of my favorite restaurants! The escargot was delicious and the foie gras melted in my mouth! My husband and I went for our anniversary and had a blast! We will definitely go back! Must try the bone marrow !",2
"This is a great gym! Thats all i have to say. It has a basketball court and racquetball courts, jacuzzi, sauna, cycle room, pool, aerobic room and a awesome free weight area. The staff are very friendly and supportive, the price is right and it just recently got remodeled with all new cardio machines.",2
"I'm a huge fan of Chinese food, but you are seriously paying for the decor and cougars that grace this place lord knows I love cougars ! The food is sub par at best and could easily be replicated at Panda Express for less. I still contend that some of the best Chinese food is located in the hoods of Las Vegas.just dont go there too late at night! LOL!",1
My sales person was awesome but today when the delivery truck showed up they brought the wrong color couch and love seat. I have read so many horrible delivery stories from Ashley and now I am living my own. It could take weeks to get a new couch and that means that me and my son have to sit on the floor. I am so upset especially since I paid extra to have my furniture delivers today.,1
Food is good and they try to purchase carry local produce and items. What had a 2nd strike from me is the service! Very slow cannot find server to get refills when u r in a party of 5 or more don't head there for lunch u will never make it under an hour. And good luck getting your order to you correctly! Just bad service over all but good is good and priced reasonable.,1
The Abacus Inn was very clean and the customer service was excellent. On the other hand the food was terrible it tasted as if it came from the freezer or out of a package. I have had better chinese food from the grocery store. The tea had to be Lipton and lacked all the flavor normal tea has in Chinese restaurants.,1
"Best set of loaders on earth! They were on time and had a very positive attitude. I would recommend them to anyone. I had a massively heavy treadmill on a second story apartment who had no problem loading it on my truck. I was moving from Nevada to California. Everything arrived intact thanks to their superb packing. Reasonably priced, too!",2
"As a Greek native I found the food to be sub par. The lamb chops were overcooked and overpriced. There calamari leaves much to be desired. There are much better Greek restaurants in Montreal, Elounda and Mythos come to mind. But if you must stay in the West Island and want to eat Greek, La Porte Grecque offers a decent Greek fare.",1
This place is great for breakfast and however many cups of coffee the help remember to fill. I think two is the limit. I overheard an argument between a customer and the manager about a brown steak. I think he watches too much CSI and should stop interrogating the customers. Have an alibi ready in case you run into any problems with your order.,1
"So, it's not high brow sushi. So what! As an alternative to chipotle, 5 guys, rando sandwich shop this place is a real winner. Sure, it's designed for the American palette but with a sharp inviting interior, free wifi, and decent beer choices this place is a decent quick service alternative. I'll be back.",2
"Finally great coffee I'd repeat! A roaster in Phoenix that has taste. Coming from the NW the palette is particular. I traveled 30 minutes to get here and try.I would repeat. Nice 'breadless' breakfast, super fast and cappuccino great flavor, could use a bit smoother foam. but it 'stuck' around in the cup! Getting online was easy too. Good people watching and energy. n Cheers",2
If i'll be courting a restaurant i'll go for a buffet at The buffet at Bellagio I would say It's Worth the wait. nReason The price is reasonable i don't think i can find anything better than this. n the service was excellent. n even though i don't eat much i left with a smile. n Good selection of food. nGuess every time I'm in Vegas i'll be staying dining with you. nBecause you complete me ,2
"I got white tip acrylics and paid 27 for them. They were thick and I asked for very thin acrylic. They were also very badly filed and they look terrible. They have been on for a week and all of the edges are lifting. Overall, very bad quality not to mention some of the nails are turning yellow which I have never seen before.",1
"This place is OK. The food was prepared very, very well. But the dishes were really boring. The scallops were served with a wear array of accompanying sauces the desserts were uninspired and the appetizers were unremarkable. The food is actually 3 stars, but considering the price, it's gotta be 2 stars.",1
I went here Oct 7th. I just moved to vegas few month ago. Tried to find good place eat. So I'm always seaching on yelp to find something good. So I find this place a lot a people said food n service is good. But it wasnt good at all. I had a AYCE. Fish quality wasnt good. N employees looked so mad no smile. Never ever wanna go back.,1
"This place is amazing. The chips are fresh and cooked there and taste great. Ordered the enchilada trio the beef was good but the green cheese and chicken fundido was amazing. Also ordered was a shredded beef taco, carne asada, mini combo and machaca. All were really good. Definitely a place to return to. Portions were good sized as well. Only bad part is they have coke not Pepsi.",2
2nd fancy place I hit up on my weekend trip to the MTL. Great ambiance. Dimly lit room. Loud but didn't have to yell across the table to have a conversation. Menu on a giant chalkboard was a great touch. Started out with the deer carpaccio and foie gras au torchon which was out of this world. Rabbit for the main course lived up to its hype. A definite place to check out for any tourist or habitant,2
"Had a Family weekend Parents,Sisters,Neices,Nephiew. I loved the whole place! The pool was amazing. Friday the kids played on a small water slide and Saturday the guy running it said my neice and nephiew couldnt go on it. Also on entering the pool we had our bags searched. 2,000 on our weekend trip im not that happy with this resort.",1
"Ordered for game night, Had both thin and hand tossed. The thin crust is definitely the way to go, great pizza! It's a little on the expensive side for pizza, and make sure you ask when you're ordering and have a question, Garlic Bread Cheese Garlic Bread, both excellent, but completely different. ciao",2
"My first time at Fox and Hound in the US. Have gone to the one in London and loves it. This place was really good. Great service, tasty food, and reasonable prices. You can eat in the bar or sit sown in the dining room. They also have 3 pool tables which seemed pretty busy. This is a place I will return to!",2
"I can best describe this as ""drunk food "". If you're drunk and it's late and you don't have a ton of money, this is a good bet. A mish mash of different types of food. Again, perfect of you're drunk with a crowd. Chicken pita was smothered in sour cream. The spaghetti with meat sauce was totally overlooked and poorly drained. There was water on the plate.",1
"4.7 5 stars If you are from St. Louis you understand. If not and you are not planning to go to Missouri in the next 4 months go to Frashers and order the following Toasted Meat Ravioli, The Original St. Louis Style pizza, Gooey Butter Cake. The only deviation from this is to order the 14 inch pizza which is not on the menu if with someone.",2
"Don't waste your time or money Drinks are seriously nasty. The juice in my vodka cranberry tasted like tampico. Nobody wanted to dance until our group 12 girls got up there. When we left, half the dance floor was empty. We stayed for about an hour.enough time to get one nasty drink in and a few songs. My recommendation Go to Tryst in the Wynn!",1
"Great atmosphere and great burgers. Me and one of my friends went here because we heard the burgers were good. I'm not a sushi person, but people come here for that as well And I have to say that the burgers were a nice size for the price. I was able to get fried pickles as a side and that was amazing! We also had awesome service too. Two thumbs up for this place!",2
I LOVE this pool area. So much fun and so pretty. Lots of palms and sand for the little ones. We have been here twice and both times they were playing great music in the background. THe poolside drink service is really good too. The girls are friendly and are around to check on you quite often. I wish it stayed open later. They close at 7 pm. It would be a fun place to swim at night.,2
"I love Thai food and this place was amazing! Great food I had the Yellow Curry and the girlfriend had the Pad Thai Both were great! The GF likes everything super HOT and it was! Be careful! We also had the coconut milk soup and it was to die for. It's a small place, but the service was great. Don't expect 5 star atmosphere, but all in all very good and excellent prices. You won't be disappointed.",2
"Just ordered and waited 1.5 hours before I called back for them to say they canceled my order because ""they knocked and called three times. And waited 10 min. "" 1 I live in a mobile home and have dogs that bark like crazy when they hear a knock, I have no voicemails, no missed calls, and NO PIZZA! PISSED",1
"Food was amazing, worth every cent. although its a lot of cents to eat there nService the same. The braised Wagyu short ribs were wonderful. nThe cheesecake sampler is very unique and amazing. Only issue was a huge group of very loud women that came in and was seated behind us and we practically could not have a conversation after that.",2
"As everyone in Madison knows, there are no doughnut chain stores around. No Krispy Kreme. No Dunkin Donuts. Although I know that the best doughnuts in town are from the Greenbush Bakery, sometimes it's just easier to go with the place down the street. That basically sums up the People's Bakery. When you're too lazy to go anywhere else, they are pretty good.",1
"The waitress was very nice. Martini's are very small and way overpriced, wine is overpriced. Food is a bit overpriced, I ask that my Burger be on Rye toast instead of a bun they charged me 1.50 extra. Used a 25 off coupon, and the bill was still 50 too high. I will stick with the smaller companies. I think they just cater to beer drinkers. Left a VERY bad taste in my mouth of all of Golden Gaming.",1
"I have always been the one to wash my car myself. That was until I moved out to Arizona. It's way too hot to manually wash. I heard about this place and it was voted 2011 Best of Phoenix. Place is quick, price is competitive. Always has specials. Where else will you get free vacuums? Quick. Clean. winning",2
"This was our third visit. I highly recommend the place. Yes, it is situated next to a gun shop in a very off strip location, but once you are in the door, you are captivated by the retro vibe, the good Italian food and the live music. We have always enjoyed our meals here. Worth a visit. Half price wine bottles on Sunday and Monday are a bonus.",2
"My husband and I take our bikes here every year for a quick tune up. The guys here are quick, inexpensive and professional. I've been to a few bike shops that are staffed by pretentious college kids and pushy salespeople. These guys don't care that I'm riding a crappy, cheap Schwinn. They're happy to tune it up and provide great service.",2
"The only reason I would go here is because of their groupon. I've been here three times now, and I probably won't be going back. I found a hair on one of the plates I pulled off the belt, and the wait or I had didn't even really acknowledge that it was something to fuss over. They are pretty expensive for what you really get. I'd say my favorite revolving sushi bar is still Teharu.",1
"Didn't eat because we were full but stopped for a beverage. Our bartender, Jennifer, was awesome and very nice. They have a cool patio with misters and shade sails. They had LED TVs everywhere. They get Sunday Ticket and UFC fights if that's your thing . I'll update my review after I eat there but it smelled awesome!",2
"It's truly a shame that Trop seems to be disintegrating because their rooms look so aesthetically pleasing. So does the rest of their renovation. I love faux tropical settings! Slots were not bad to me either neither were their table games. The pool looked mighty gorgeous. But they seem to be losing all their shows, themes, and concepts.and that's sad.",2
"Love the palazzo have been to Vegas many times and was told by my good friends how they love that property and now I know why! Guest services was awesome, room was fanatic shops and restaurants were out of control! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that pool area is alil dead not too happening for over 25 over crowd but besides that we would totally stay there agaiext time we are in Vegas!",2
"These guys really know what they are doing, I've had bad experiences in the past from the ""geek squad "" people. The people at Redseven know what's up. They are very knowledgeable and each time I go in there, they are looking to help me out rather then get me to buy something I don't need. I recommend them to all my friends and family, you should do the same.",2
"Man, this stuff is good. Yes they are a bit pricey, but you are getting really good quality and really good burgers. You'd pay more for a crappy burger at Applebee's, for sure. Five Guys doesn't really compare to fast food if you know your beef. As an aside, the soda machines are a fascinating study in generational usability. Just sit over there and observe for five minutes.",2
"The concept is honestly pretty cool, but it's also completely impractical. For those with children, aloft is simply impossible to work with. The property was clean and the service was good, but the strange rooms with things like a pocket door bathroom providing little to no privacy just make it a place I won't be visiting again.",1
I've been a patient for about 3 years now and each visit just gets better each time. The dental assistants are always friendly and help put you at ease even when that big bright light is the last thing you want to see not to mention those instruments oh horror! . Dr. Ben Truong's friendly demeanor and professionalism also greatly reassure you when discussing your treatment plan and options.,2
"YUMMY! Had both chicken and beef and YUUUUMMMMEEEE! I'll pay attention to the saltiness I never noticed that, but from what I know I could eat at this place everyday and never get tired of it. And it's not 15 bucks for a meal! You can get the 2 peice chicken combo for 5 bucks7 bucks for beef. water, bing bang boom you got yourself a nutritious meal, for cheap! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",2
"Was disappointed with service mgmt. Owner thought we were doing HER a favor by coming here. Asked to be moved away from front door as it was 45 deg outside.gave me a look like, ""how dare you ask me that! "" Could tell she went into kitchen and told our server, as she then comes out with an attitude. Other way better places, sans the attitude in Gilbert to eat at. I'm done with this place.",1
"They were pretty good about ""pre bussing "" the table but they did so with a chip on their shoulder as if they couldn't wait to get off work to go gamble their money away in the casino's. Because of this, our table of 10 did not feel welcome at all. The food was ""okay "" at best. We came here because of a reference from a friend that the place was good. Boy, were they wrong.",1
"Thought I'd try this place out after seeing all the hype on yelp n. Came to the conclusion that they are just OKAY. Not the best. There are much better taco trucks out here. 2 stars for their decent closing hours, place to get food when you have NO OTHER OPTIONS. Either way, if it came down to that I would rather eat juliobertos or Albertos Etc ",1
"Great breakfast food! Small, cozy and a fun place to meet friends up in Carefree, AZ. Seating indoors and outdoors. There is a very small section for pets, so if you have a dog, there is a separate patio area with two small tables. First come first serve but well worth it if Fido likes to eat with you!",2
"We went here for the first time tonight and loved it! everything was so fresh tasting and wonderful. I recommend getting the veggie plate with 7 selections of salad and hummus and then get a kabob combo. Share both for a delicious dinner for 2. The grape leaves were terrific as was the lamp kabobs. Also, very lovely interior decor. Will go back when we visit Knight Theater or Bechtler Museum.",2
"Food is bland and a bit dry. Sauces could be heavier and better flavored. Notably, tibs were very mild and other dishes were barely warm. Plate came with salad ?! and Italian dressing. Random sour cream. Good Ethiopian food should be hot and seep into the injera to make a delicious bite. not the case here.",1
Had business brunch today. The Tortilla Espanola was just like Mom used to make. My guest had the sliced duck sandwich. Looked great I'm sure it tasted just as good. Didn't think it was good idea to ask for a bite. Service was great. Must come back for dinner and try some great Spanish dishes. Kudos to Chef Gio and his staff. Much success going forward.,2
I had a service scheduled. I took work off to be available for it. Nobody showed up. I contacted who I believed to be the owner turns out it was just the owner's daughter telling people she owned the company to find out why my service was skipped. She said her father wasn't feeling well and they would need to reschedule. I would never pay money to get serviced from such an unprofessional company.,1
TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE! The minute we walked in they hounded us about what color we wanted! Then their gel Polish wasn't good so I opted out of everything and they continued to charge even though they DID NOTHING! They talked so much crap the entire time we were there. nShitty service and shitty products. My friends Polish was chipping within 24 hours. And their selection was crap!,1
"This restaurant is both fun and delicious. The architecture is beautiful and we liked everything we ordered. We had oysters, tartare beef, salmon and tuna , beef carpaccio, and scallop tadakis. Cocktails were yummy and they have a variety of wines to choose from. This place is on the pricey side, but I would recommend.",2
"The food was fantastic. Service, while friendly, was very slow and inattentive. I don't think we'd have a gotten a refill all night without asking for it, and several tables seated after us were served and received their meals first. I got the impression that other servers were better, and the problem was ours in particular and not the restaurant overall.",2
"We have been going to Red Rocks for special celebrations for over 10 years. The last few times we have been there, it's been a big disappointment. Tonight we dropped over 200 for mediocre steaks and poor service on a birthday celebration for our daughter, and they were unwilling to comp her 7 dessert, which they have always done in the past. No desire to go back.",1
"On my wedding day, I had an apt to come here. I showed up 30 min before my apt and was seated to a station 30 mins after my scheduled apt. nI had asked for eye lash, makeup and my hair just curled. I was charged more then what was asked for as prices and not only did the hair all break from nstrands, but my face broke out from whatever they used and lashes fell out, before my ceremony.",1
"It is so hard to find an authentic Italian restaurant on the strip, but Casanova is absolutely that. One of the best meals I have ever had, period. Andy, the owner, is very generous and makes everyone feel like they are eating in his dining room back in Italy. Each member of my party of four raved about their meal there cannot be many better dining experiences on the strip. Highly recommended.",2
"I ordered a salmon dish with asparagus and other vegetables. There was nothing wrong with the quality of the food, but it literally took me 30 seconds to eat because the portion size was so small. I really do not like spending 26 on a dish that doesn't come close to filling me up. We had to go eat somewhere else afterwards since we were still hungry.",1
"Overall very good food, and drinks. Reasonably priced, and the waitress that we had was awesome. The only hiccup was the hostess not providing us with a menu. First time going here, and will come back. Nice to know there are still nice sports bars, with decent prices on food and drinks around. Also the flat breads are great.",2
"Heads up This McDonald has higher prices for kids meals compared to other McDs in the area. Also, our food was over cooked and wrong 2 times. The staff was nice and walked around to check on customers as they were eating. The dining area was very clean and with great temperature. The prices is probably a reason to avoid coming here again.",1
"I hate Fremont Street Experience, but tourists love it. Why not experience the pinnacle of 1970's technology coupled with music from the 1980's. Blech. About the only good thing about this place is the once an hour when they put on the show and everyone freezes, making it easier to walk to your destination. Can't believe so many old people will actively dance to pre recorded music as if it's live.",1
"Horrible dry cleaners! nFirst off they take twice as long as any other cleaners in town. They did an alteration on a suit of mine, I get it home and they didn't even do it! A week for nothing! And when I take it back they said it would take another week to do! Ludicrous! Horrible customer service! Noone smiles or is welcoming at all! DO NOT GO TO DRY CLEAN DEPOT!",1
My family absolutely loves this place! The owner's and the employees are super friendly. They always have a great variety of fro yo available and a nice mix of toppings. The frequent customer card is great! We are forever getting free yogurts because we go there so much. My favorite at Poppy's? Cheesecake yogurt with granola and chocolate chips absolutely delicious!,2
"They did an awesome job recreating the streets of New York. I mean, I've never been to New York. But if this is what it's like. I can't wait to visit! If New York isn't like this. please, don't burst my bubble. This was one of the first of the new generation of themed hotel casinos in Las Vegas, I was around when they first opened. It was and still is sort of a big deal.",2
"Talk about gourmet burger! Very creative concept, delicious food too. Ordered the Rising Sun! Kobe Beef Burger, Tempura Avocado, Teri Glaze Nori. Paired with Shoestring Fries a sip of that Alcoholic Oreo Milkshake from my friend. It was a yummy food experience but not a fan of the price. But I guess that's what I get for eating at the Cosmo. Haha!",2
"The place was pretty empty. Service was friendly. I ordered a French Dip. awful awful awful The dip I have no clue what it was. Something was on the bottom and it was clear on top. It tasted like water that had coloring in it. The nasty ""swiss cheese? "" I can assure you that it was not Swiss cheese. pretty lousy",1
"I've seen 'O', KA and La Nouba. 'O' was my first and best Cirque du Soleil show. The acrobatics, diving, tumbling, story line, etc. were all amazing. We sat front and center and I remember feeling like a dream was being played out in front of me. This is an absolute must see regardless of the price.",2
"We tried this new place in the Superstition Springs Mall Food Court. Even though we ate close to closing time, all of the food looked very fresh. We enjoyed the beef and lamb gyros as well as the salads and the yellow rice was very nicely seasoned with saffron. We will definitely be going back SOON!",2
"My boyfriend and I used to live across the street from this place. There's a circle K right by us too, but we would ALWAYS go here. The owner is so friendly and remembers us every time. Super awesome beer selection and a build your own 6 pack for super cheap. Good prices, friendly staff and super convenient!",2
Best ice cream in Pittsburgh. I love Dave and Andy's. The smell of the place is enough to draw a crowd from miles. With delicious and often experimental flavors there is always something new to try. The price is right too. The only SMALL complaint I have is that the place is a little run down inside. It's kind of dirty and small. Try the sweet cream it will change your life. Highly recommend.,2
"Quality is certainly not what it was last year. Runny eggs, burnt hash browns, and salty gravy. Doeeds to retire. He is short with customers, gossipy, and just plain rude. We have frequented this restaurant on a bi weekly basis for seven years. No more. I refuse to eat in a place that is hostile. I am not even going to mention the recent episode where Don berated a special needs family. Shocking!",1
"Incredibly unique place to eat in AZ. The food is unbelievable, the service is great, and the ambiance has to be one of the best in the entire state. Outside seating recommended. There is nothing like it. Great music and vibe as well. In my opinion, this is one of the best places to wine and dine, especially for dates and anniversaries. Dinner menu recommended over lunch.",2
"We did the Chef's tasting menu some items were outstanding, some were good but nothing special. The service was great and the sommelier is extremely knowledgable but it did take us almost an hour to go from sitting at our table to getting the first cheese course. I'd probably come back here, but I wasn't blown away to say I need to come back.",2
"For the love of donuts, Dunkin Donuts Corporate, please close this store! This location has been through many management changes, none of which are making significant progress toward a more enjoyable customer experience. Please get rid of everyone in the store and start over with someone who will execute the brand, or close it for good.",1
Steve Wynn should be slapped for this garbage establishment. I'm not saying it's the worst food I've ever had but I left feeling VERY disappointed. It's not Wynn quality. i wouldn't even put this place in Circus Circus. I just remember getting the bill and being pissed. I think the hotel ended up comping that lunch though.,1
"Terrible, do NOT sign a contract. I moved away and there was not a massage envy close to me. They wouldn't work with me, I had 3 massage's that I paid for but didn't use because of where I live now. No one would work with me. The Staff sucks, and the massage's are short by 15 20 mins. Total RIP OFF! Stay away from this overpriced place! TERRIBLE, A JOKE, NOT WORTH IT, BAD SERVICE, STAY AWAY!",1
"Great customer service. I wanted a drink that wasn't on the menu and they gladly accommodated my request. My husband ordered a croissant which was also good. My favorite aspect of this cafe is the ambiance. They have a sun roof and the walls are windows, allowing the light to flood in. Cute little two person tables, so romantic. Definitely a place you want to check out!",2
"Cristina from accounting pros has been an amazing find for our company. Her payroll company took over over as our provider several months ago and the results have been great. I call it professional payroll services with personality. From bookkeeping to solutions implementation, she's great to work with. I highly recommend.",2
I've ordered take out from this place four times. The first two times were fine. The second time they didn't make the order until I arrived and then it was totally wrong. This morning I had a chance to observe the restaurant for a few minutes while waiting for my food and the management is poor. The food is fine but I wouldn't expect much for service.,1
"If you are looking for quantity, this is your place. If you want a sandwich that tastes like something good, move on. Service was slow and the cashier didn't really know what any of the sandwiches were. The beef cheddar was bland and the cheese wasn't melted. Turkey club and pastrami sandwiches were about the same.",1
"It makes me feel a little better that I am not the only person who has had a problem with the doughy pizza here. Time after time I have ordered delivery and the pizza is raw in the center, the sauce is watery, and their offer to send out a new pizza has resulted in little improvement. This place has ruined Papa John's for me.",1
Stay AWAY from the black dude at the shop! He literally cut me on my face and acted like all was okay. I'm not certain if it was deliberate or he's just that retarded and incompetent. Visiting this shop sincerely dampened Vegas as I wore my gash like a freaking face tat. My buddies were served from the other barbers and their cuts came out decent. I so should've followed their lead.,1
Just a note.I am here on a pretty regular basis and BIG NEWS PEOPLE! Pittsburgh Willy's NOW SERVES CHICAGO STYLE DOGS! My boyfriend ate his in about 30 seconds. So that tells you something. If you ever feel the need to change something with an order Randy and his co workers will be more than willing to serve it up the way you like with no problem!,2
I was very surprised by our visit to Outback tonight. Out management team is in town for a meeting and we decided to grab a quick dinner. Our waitress Trista was very attentive to our needs. Our drinks never went empty. Our food was cooked perfectly. My only complaint is our table was very close to a table on both sides of us so it became a little to cozy.,2
"Been going here for the orange chicken since I was a kid! Moved back to PHX awhile back and realized they do delivery! Super fast and piping hot! I was greatly surprised how good their food was for delivery It's our new go to, and I'm telling anyone that cares because great Chinese take out or delivery is hard to find in Central Phx!",2
"Could this place be even slower? There's often a line when we've gone, with only one or two people working. We go so rarely that I don't even think about the line until I open the door and have to stop short. Other than long lines, they seem to be well equipped, and some of the staff are quite. nice.",1
We ordered the Lobster Fest lobster shrimp grill which was served with lobster shrimp macaroni and cheese and steamed broccoli. The wait staff was outstanding. The food presentation and taste was excellent and the price was a good value at 24. I can't speak for other Red Lobster locations but this one has a highly trained and motivated staff.,2
"Me, and my entire family 5 cars have been going here for years, from oil changes to serious problems. Every time we go, Rip does a fantastic job, and is transparent and honest throughout. Never work without asking first, and always try to help on the price they've even done some small stuff for free .",2
"What a joke. First day I wait, the guy finally called me and told me he couldn't be there in the quoted time, so I rescheduled for the next day. I never got a call the next day so I called and the guy didn't even have me in the books, and told me he'd be here an hour and a half after my quoted time! I told him to cancel and he hung up on me!",1
All I saw was drugs dealing fights! This place is a big joke! They should shut this place down! Rooms for the inn they give you a place to sleep eat and shower and they talk about god what to know your story! Than go on to say money is bad but the people saying in jumping in to benz high dollar cars funny bullshit here it made me think of PTL telling you shut this place down!,1
I talked my family in to going there for my birthday. I am one of those people who can eat anything with out getting sick. This place did the trick! I was sick for 24 hours. If you take the fryer out of that restaurant they won't be able to cook at all. Even the dinner roll saw the inside of the deep fryer! I so wanted it to be good. Very sad it wasn't!,1
"Delicious! The food was excellent and quick. Perfect portions. The staff was fantastic! Super attentive and nice. We loved the music and large seating. Came here originally to use a groupon, ended up getting happy hour and saving the groupon for later because we will be back! nWe tried the calamari, tomato bruschetta, Mac Cheese, ravioli and stuff mushrooms OMG! All yummy",2
" ""Gus Pizza "". Or should I call it ""Gross pizza "". Honestly, frozen pizza from grocery store had more flavors than their pizza! I will make this short! If you want to grab few drinks, sure! If you wanna great pizza, visit your local grocery store or pizza delivery. It will save your money and bad taste in your mouth!",1
I came here on my first night in Vegas on 5 de Mayo weekend. It was a Friday and Tiesto was playing. We got invited to a table on the very top floor with an amazing view for Tiesto. We partied and danced all night and I absolutely loved the VIP experience. I will definitely be coming back to check out more of their resident DJs. I had so much fun.,2
"Suggested this place today to my foodie friend. 1st time for the both of us.n unfortunately, probably the last. The chips fresh n hot n spicy salsa in the squeezy bottle .off to a good start. Service was typical. The beans and rice were nothing special. Atmosphere was cute, tiny thou. Overall. food was rather overpriced.",1
Comfy BEDS! Oh my the beds here are great. The hotel is very affordable and clean. The location is great. everything is within walking distance. The buffet in the hotel is great! definatly worth your money! My only complaint was the stores inside the hotel. they suck. Go into any other hotel around there and they have such nice stores! What does this one have? A starbucks. Lame,2
"I got surprised by this place. Stopped in for something and ended up with the world's most non conventional chopped salad. Not what I expected or like any other chopped salad. However, it was so good I enjoyed it without the dressing. And I'd go back for seconds tomorrow if I was in town. A bit spendy, bit worth every penny.",2
they did not take my visa which is a culture shock for me. most businesses in the u.s. do if they take credit card. food's pretty good but i feel like i paid 7 for more rice than red tofu curry. if my bike were here i wouldn't care but a little annoyed especially since i just discovered it's a franchise. still the service was fast and the cashier made sure i was ok.,1
"This is one of the worst cups of coffee I've ever had. Not only was the coffee three dollars for 16 ounces, it was acidic, cold, and from a pump machine brewed who knows when. The shop offered nothing but coffee and limited varieties at that. I would honestly be surprised if this place was in business six months from now.",1
"Amazing beer as noted by all. Award winning selection and ambiance. Not noted by most no TV in the place! I absolutely love that there isn't a television drawing everyone's attention. Otherwise, nice staff and dim decor, and a really pleasant Irish music session on Sundays from 5 8 p.m. Sundays and Mondays also presently feature 1 PBR and 2 Jameson's whiskey . Can't be beat.",2
"I had an appointment today at noon and no one showed up. I got approval for security to let them into my unit because I was at work all day. I was excited to come home to a clean place, but I walked in to find it exactly as I left it. No one called to let me know they were canceling. It was just a no call no show. Very disappointed!",1
"I couldn't be happier with what she's created for my assistant. Absolutely GORGEOUS work! I'm from CA, my assistant is in AZ, but everything worked out better than I could have imagined. nRachel is by far my favorite florist so far. She's so easy going, personable and is definitely not pushy like some others out there. I will be a returning customer for sure.",2
This will be the first and last time I use the airlines. They charge a 50 fee just to bring a carry on item on the flight. No forewarning. The customer service was dull at best. They seemed to be going through the motions and truly emotionless when it came to customer service. I am going to be sticking with Southwest or United.,1
"My wife and I absolutely love this place. The food, service, and atmosphere are absolutely fantastic. We've been there three times this week already. and have designated Wolfley's as our favorite neighborhood restaurant bar. The servers we have had. Marti and Melissa have been awesome. And the manager, Larry, is great. This place is a must try.",2
"The service was inattentive and slow. Food took forever to come out. nThe two other people in my party had some nice steaks, but mine was undercooked and a bit cold. The seafood appetizer we had was pretty basic and a deep fried mess. Nothing exciting to see here. For these prices, go to BOA in Caesars.",1
"i was really unimpressed with the pizza here. nit's conveninetly located, but never very busy, even at it's prime location by a bar even on a friday night. ncheap slices, and easy to get in and out of, but of all the many, many people i know who frequent this area, none of them really ever eat there.",1
"Beautiful, delicious and daring. Menu is edgy, especially for Phoenix, and bravo to Josh Hebert for having the courage to bring forward such unusual items as kangaroo, frogs legs, unique uni preparations and various animal cheeks. While the soups were somewhat disappointing muted flavors, boring , the rest of the well executed menu more than made up for it. Truly great experience overall.",2
I had the chicken chimichanga which was surprisingly great. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The margaritas are huge. Service was prompt and pleasant. The menu has an awesome array of selections. I had a hard time choosing my meal. Inexpensive place. The only thing I do not like is they drown everything with lettuce.,2
"WE LOVE AS YOU WISH and have been going to this location for approximately ten years. We were there today for 2 1 2 hours, and walked out feeling totally relaxed. The staff is helpful, and they have hundreds of pottery pieces to choose from. The paint selection is extensive, as well as items needed to finish your piece. The best part . . . the memories created with family and friends!",2
"Gorgeous restaurant, but the food was mediocre. I got the Kung Pow Beef, which was quite bland. The Egg Drop soup tasted like the smell of chlorine and was very gelatinous, although not many places make it brothy Like I like it! . Ehh. I really wanted to like this place. I may come back to try some sushi and look at the decor.",1
Best hummus in town. The prices are very reasonable and it just plain feels good in the dining room. Its not fancy you bus your own table but the food is excellent. I've seen it get crazy on game days but the numerous employees do a great job. The workers are UW students I assume and they're friendly and considerate. I'm always happy I went.,2
"Steve's makes a great pizza, but their service is definitely lacking. There's nothing like ordering a delicious Philly Cheese pizza only to show up and receive a plain cheese. The guy behind the counter just looks at you like you're an idiot, doesn't try to even apologize, rings you up, and tosses you your pizza. They get a B for the pizza and a D for service.",1
"I recently went to Vegas with the ladies. We ate at many places and by far Spago had the best service! We had lunch there and the waiters gave impeccable service. We always had full water, our wine refilled and our dishes taken away when done but they were so discrete about it. They were very in tune with us and treated us like royalty. The food was excellent too. I highly recommend them.",2
"Went to the show on 8 25. The food sucked, the show itself i was expecting more. For the price i paid even with a groupon it was too much, if i wanna see crappy acting ill go see a kristen stewart movie. It was really the audience that makes the show not the actors. Next time ill just do my own murder mystery",1
"Pho was pretty good and drinks were as well. It was good and fast service, staff was friendly and speedy. The place is like a cafeteria style where you sit with strangers, smart move to get more people in and out. This is a pretty good pho place and I've been to many in Toronto. Price was standard for Pho. We all had a good time here. Would go back when I'm in town!",2
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Every time I go here my nails don't last longer than a week. I've had two break off and I just had them done. The nail techs make my nails too thin and it's always half assed. So frustrating because I've been going to them for a few months and their quality of work has just gone down hill. Won't be back again.",1
"Came for lunch, it was dead but service was on point. My only problem, small case if food poisoning. This had to have come from the tuna toro bc it was the only thing my guest and I shared. Other than that, it was great experience! I'm not mean enough to slam them for it, I was eating raw food and maybe the fish ate poison itself. Poor thing ",1
"I thought this place was great, the eggs were cooked perfectly and hash browns were AWESOME since they were so crispy. I am not the only one that must think so since the place was packed! I enjoyed the coffee and service was great, it is a nice little cafe in the strip mall and I would go again. I love a great breakfast.",2
"The food and drinks here are amazing. I had the mango and jicama salad to start with and the steak tacos for lunch. The primarita margarita was delicious too. The tortillas are fantastic as was the beef. I want to come back on my next trip out to Arizona, this place was wonderful and so was the service. Loved the hostess that is a student at ASU, she is lovely. great place!",2
"Dr. Tingey mis diagnosed me. nThis doctor is insincere and totally dissconnected from his patients. nI need hip surgery, but he wanted to do a orthoscopic to fix a muscle tear, nwhich is not causing the pain. nOrthoscopic surgery would have been a waste of time. nI did my research and found a doctor who could help.",1
"I don't know where to start. Imagine your most ridiculous customer service nightmare and then times that by 10. You'd start to get close the experiences I've had with this unethical, unprofessional ""business "". I am only forced to continue dealing with them due to their contract with a home warranty company. Save your and your time go elsewhere.",1
"Had issues with my roller ball on my blackberry. I took it in to this Sprint and they were able to fix it in just a few minutes! This is one of the only repair places for Sprint that ACTUALLY repairs the phones.not just box and ship them somewhere else. We plan on moving out of Chandler, but I WILL make the trip for any of my cell phone needs to this Sprint!",2
"The experience was perfect. The staff and waitress was amazingly attentive. The food was stellar. We had the crab cakes to start, yum! We had the anchor chili scallops and coffee rub steak, both were perfect, the scallops blew my mind! I took the pina colada cake to go, so moist and tasty. Highly recommended!",2
"Went for lunch and had the spicy fried rice and thai iced coffee. The soup that came with the meal was outstanding as well as the eggroll and potsticker. She asked how spicy I wanted the rice and I said medium and it was plenty spicy but had great flavor, very glad I didn't pick any more spice. Very good price on a great meal and thinking of going back tonight for dinner.",2
"fairly new to the rainbow robindae area and i was glad we came across baidu china bistro they are very nice people in the phone and delivery, and their food is tastey, and yummy, not bland like some other chinese food spots. spicy orange chicken is awesome, and their spicy eggplant n tofu is delish! definately our Go To Chinese place from now on. ",2
I was seen 10 minutes after signing in. Everyone was polite and helpful. I only give 4 stars because the PA was polite enough but kept seeming like she didn't want to be there and left her used gloves an other things used for sanitation just lying around when she was done. Otherwise it wasn't a bad trip.,2
"Fantastic! I've watched shows where the host goes to a restaurant, tries their foods and explains the flavors, textures, and so forth. I never really understood until I came to this restaurant. So I'm going to keep it simple this restaurant's food is clean, fresh, made to order. You can taste every single ingredient, layer by layer. A must go back to.",2
"I came down from Oregon for the UO vs. ASU football game and told my brother we had to stop in. This place did not disappoint us. The beans and rice looked bland, but they were not. I had a fish taco, delish. My brother had the chicken fajfitas, loved them. I can.t to come back down for Thansgiving and bring my husband to enjoy. Go Ducks!",2
If your looking for real authentic Mexican food this is not the place to go. This is out the box from your local food store frozen food section I was very disappointed due to advertising flyers having mouth watering pictures. I ordered the deluxe nachos and the cheese was not even melted. Never will eat here again. False advertising!,1
Worst nail job I've had in my life. Didn't do what I asked and began chipping off next day. The actual nail not just the polish. Then even after I went back in and requested them to fix them my nails it's been 4 days have began cracking. There is bubbles in them. Horrible and a waste of mula to go here.,1
"If I could give this facility a ""0 "" I would. A technician lasered my tattoo, because she failed to follow protocol. I now have scar tissue and am fighting to obtain sufficient reimbursement for my pain and suffering. I am a health care administrator and have never been so disgusted with a health care facility thus far in my career.",1
Quaint little hole in the wall deli with super fresh ingredients and very inventive daily specials. Their hummus and corn chowder are superb. Their flatbread pizzas are delish! The owner chef is a very down to earth guy who often visits tables to personally check on your meal. And don't forget to grab a carrot cake before you go!,2
"If I was able to give less than one star I would. This is the most pathetic customer service provider I have ever dealt with. You'll spend more time and money actually trying to get their service to work. 2 service visits, 4 phone calls with hours spent going in circles, and the internet service caot be fixed. Do yourself a favor and stay away.",1
"Service was good, food not so much. I've ordered chicken and cheese crapes. Chicken used in crapes was the absolute lowest quality possible it was not chewable and pieces were holding on to each other with something string like. I took one bite and ewwwww! Otherwise it wouldn't be bad. Not ordering anything with chicken there anymore.",1
"I like the vibe of the place a lot, it's nice, but relaxed at the same time. The food was decent, but I liked the setup of the place. it's good enough to take guests to, and you're also able to have lively conversation at the same time, without worrying that you're being to loud. Tip Go to Costco and get a gift card Costco usually has gift cards at a discount, and you can save money that way.",2
"Went here for dinner, we were greeted by everyone right away with a very friendly smile! The wait staff is so nice and friendly makes you feel right at home! The sushi is the best in the area! Rice is very sticky and tastes amazing! The fish melts in yours mouth, and everything is do fresh, unlike your all you can eat places! A must go!",2
"Lunchtime crowd and we were seated right away. That's when we were ""forgotten "" ! It took longer then it should for the server to get back and get us our drinks. Even longer to take our order and I mentioned it to the server. Next thing is we're bring served by entirely different server. Which took even more time. I didn't like the way we were served and the menu was weak. I'm not going back .,.",1
"The bussers are better than the server and that says a lot considering there are only four tables seated in this joint. I am giving a two star because the sangria is awesome and only 2, however, the service is lacking. I'm fairly positive that my server is high. Plus who wears a limp Mohawk to work!",1
"Slaughter Associates is like having a family member who can fix cars. Absolutely the best auto repairs in the valley! Brian is honest and knows what he is doing. He even fixed the window that wouldn't stay up, in my Mom's car, for free. That never happens in the world of car repair. I highly recommend Slaughter Associates for all your auto repairs.",2
The worst ice cream shop ever! We ordered two scoop sundaes and they were the SMALLEST scoops I have ever seen in my life! I use to love that place. What happened? nNot to mention the girl that helped us was a little rude. nThis is the second time we went there and had a bad experience. We will not be going back. Beware everyone! nCold Stone Creamery from now on.,1
"Good people, great service. Been going there for a while now, and always going to Andrea. She's super cool and funny. Although busy on weekends, strip mall parking is aplenty, and if you happen to have a long wait, you can just hit Fry's next door to do some grocery shopping while you wait. Target and many other stores close by in this convenient location.",2
Service was very slow. Took at least 20 minutes to get my food when there was only one car in front of me. The girl at the drive through wasn't very friendly. nThe food was ok. Well at least the burger was good. My friend got two beef tacos and she said they were gross. Jack in the box has better tacos for a better price. They weren't with the 1.50. nProbably won't be back to this location.,1
Amazing place. We are from Washington so this was our first AMC experience and it was excellent. Love how you just push a button on your seat and the server brings you everything. The wait on the popcorn was a little long comparative to getting our other food and drinks. They even validated 4hrs of parking from the garage.,2
"went here for dinner and it was HORRIABLE. they had no meat really that only thing was some roast beef that was extremely hard, the taco salad and taco shells were stale, the featured dessert was hard there was only one waiter working for the whole place. Very disappointed we all felt very ill after leaving. we don't be returning. Cost way TOOO much",1
"Poutineville lets you create your own personal poutine dish. There's choices of cheeses, vegetables, meats, sauces and more. Best poutine I've had and I definitely nrecommend it. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach so of course I ordered the larger portion which was exactly what they say, grande. So much food but so good. Go with the regular portion unless you're feeling adventurous.",2
"Came here based on reviews and it was worth it! If I could give this place 4.5, I would. The only thing that kept it from a 5 was the onion rings because the onions were too wide.not enough flavor. Love their sauces and tater tots! This place may be known for their burgers but the pork was fantastic.it'll get me back here for sure! Would most definitely recommend this place.",2
"Beautiful decor classy, cozy and very comfortable on a cool AZ evening! They have a great happy hour 5 wedge salad 1 2 price cocktails. I enjoyed the French 7018 and it was fantastic gin, apricot and prosecco.how can you go wrong with that combination? We will definitely be back for more tasty cocktails and eats!",2
"My FAVE place for happy hour. Especially great during football season. They have happy hour for Monday Night Football from 'kick off' to the final play. I usually order their fried calamari and a glass of white wine. Hubby and I consider ourselves ""regulars "". We've been to both Yard Houses in Vegas. Looking forward to the Yard House that will be opening in San Jose Santana Row in February 2011.",2
Amazing amazing AMAZING. Had an issue with my drink and the manager Austin went out of his way to make up for it. Dutch bros is always friendly and puts the customer first and today they definitely took care of me. So thankful for all the great people dutch bros hires especially at this surprise location.,2
"Shufflin' ova to Zia Record Exchange in Chandler, AZ! They got a good selection of CD's available used and new. They even have LMFAO! They don't have as big a selection as Rasputin Records in CA., but enough to keep the party rock in the house tonight! It's cool having these stores around where you can still shop for new and used CD's and Dvd's. They even have LP records!",2
"Don't let the fancy shmancy atrium distract you! Room had ROACHES! Flat screen in the room was tiny ! In door pool was also small , and always crammed full of kids. Seeing that many kids in there, I opted not even to dip my toe in you know how kids are in swimming pools! On site steakhouse was disappointing. Location was in the middle of a seedy looking area!",1
Came here with a friend not knowing what to expect. It was in one word hip. I had a sazerac and the jalapeno bacon mac'n'cheese both of which were fantastic. The atmosphere is very chill and it was easy to find an area to suit your interests. The service was helpful and friendly and overall was a great experience! Definitely worth checking out if you're anywhere nearby.,2
"Blah. I remember going to the Palm in San Diego several years ago and being very pleased. Here in the Forum Shops, it was ""whatever. "" The caesar salad was wilted too warm, the fish was dry, and onion strings and chips were sopping in oil. If you're in a pinch at the Shops and there's no other place to eat, then maybe go and try to find a good dish. Otherwise, walk on by.",1
Terrible experience I would recommend avoiding. I was shaved and nicked up with a dull straight razor. It was painful and unpleasant. The haircut was average at best after nicking up my face the barber didn't bother to clean up the back of my neck. I was happy to do it myself at home with a sharp razor. I will not be going back.,1
A friend recommended this place while I was visiting Madison. I was hesitant because it's a chain but she highly recommended. I regret not just yelping for an Italian restaurant in Madison. The food wasn't that great and the service was OK. I'm tired of Italian restaurants throwing noodles and sauce together and calling it an Italian dish. Lessoned learned.I'll stick to yelping restaurants.,1
Was not too impressed with the food. Spaghetti was soggy and T bone steak was burnt. Potato was hard. The waiter did not smile at all. He was slow in bringing a refill on the drinks. Then I had my daughter with me to he places a hot plate in front her and tells her it's hot! Well duh! The girls gonna touch it.,1
"This is so not worth the money or your time. The burgers are nothing special, the fries were HORRIBLE and the chili dog was a JOKE! It had very little chili kind of spread on the one side of the bun which turned out to be a good thing because the chili was NASTY! I was so excited to try it hoping for a really good burger place but we will not go back!",1
"The wings were just fine, but the restaurant seemed dirty. The floor was sticky, the tables had not been cleaned, and the whole place smelled like stale beer. I wasn't looking for fine dining, but I was looking for a place that looks like it passed it's health inspection. I don't think I will be returning on my next trip.",1
"We arrived at 9 00 a.m. We picked our pumpkins, cucumbers, and apples. The line was so ridiculously long, I wanted to leave, but my kids wanted to buy their pumpkins! They should be using Square and hire more cashiers to work the line! Or better yet, get some volunteers to help and give them some complimentary pumpkins!",1
"Cheesecake Factory style, Very international food on the menu, which means good selection, and something for anyone. nPrices are good too, its on the cheap side for Vegas P nI had the mushroom burger and my husband had the Ahi salad, both were Amazing. Service was good, the only minus is the ""outside "" seating area is within the casino facing slot machines, therefore the decor is so so.",2
"I've only visited once, but I had a great experience! The waiter was friendly and the food came out a minute or two after we ordered it. It seems like a great late night spot to grab sushi and drinks. I think the price is a bit much for sushi during normal hours, but I will be back again for their happy hour specials.",2
"Damn, usually LOVE Five Guys. Got my cheeseburger to go. Got back to work and noticed that the bottom bun had obviously been dropped on the floor. It had several pieces of hair and fuzz all over it! Flip'n NASTY! I still give this location 1 star because the Cajun frys are second to none. It'll be awhile before I visit this location again.",1
"Nothing super special, but they do standard breakfast stuff pretty well. The service is so so sometimes really friendly and helpful and other times really slow and a bit rude. But overall a good place to meet for breakfast. The restaurant is pretty big, so you're likely to find a spot even on weekend mornings.",2
As an employee of the palms I don't recommend this place. every time I order something's wrong. This time they got my order wrong after waiting 25 minutes. Then one of the employees was rude to me like it was my fault. Remade my food with the same fries so they were cold. Great job guys! If this is how you treat employees how the fuck do you treat your guests?,1
I came here a few months back and the food was really good. I came again today and that was not the case. The food was oily and the service sucked. Our waitress barely even spoke to us and it took her 20min to bring us out check after she glanced at us when we were done. She seemed super unenthusiastic to be at her job and definitely took it out on us. I don't think ill be back.,1
I love all of the Ross stores! When I used to live in mn and would come to visit I would buy all my shoes for the season here. Now that I live here I'm addicted. I usually can't leave without buying a new dress. I also buy all my niece and nephews presents here. The prices are awesome. It can be hit and miss for the stock so of coarse I shop all the time! Lol!,2
"I don't seem to have good luck at zipps had a bad experience at another location decided to try this close to home, I ordered a salad the lettuce was old brown and wilted, when server asked how it was I was honest she was like clueless, never sent a manager over to say sorry. When she brought the card back she left no pen to sign",1
"2 stars only because the staff was really sweet. Hands down the worst manicure pedicure I have probably ever had, while at the same time by far the most expensive. Turns out my travel mates had already figured this out last year, too bad I had time to kill before their planes landed and wasn't forewarned. I would absolutely not go back.",1
"We swung by after happy hour on a Friday, and were surprised that it wasn't busy and we were able to sit right down. We chowed on the chips and salsa, and our waitress was happy to fill us up again. For dinner, I had another yummy black bean and cheese burrito! Everyone seemed pleased with their food and I just love quaint little downtown Chander. Now if only they served Z'Teja's margaritas here.",2
"Meh. I like Liberty Market and the Grill.all by the same guy.but I don't get the hysteria about this place. The sauces are not ah mazing. The meats all kind of blend together and are underwhelming. If I am in downtown Gilbert I would rather go to Liberty Markey, Postinos, or Romeo's Cafe. If I need BBQ that bad, I could go to Chilli's and get the dry rub ribs.",1
Took family in from out of town. We all love Thai I can't believe I have not been before! It is easily the best Thai on this side of town and probably can go toe to toe with whatever else is out there. The Tom Yung soup was awesome great balance of flavors. The red curry is addictive. We were there for their first anniversary and all received complimentary dessert to boot! yum!,2
"As long as I can get coffee. How bad can things be. nCoffee is one of the best things that happened in the world. Greater Than Coffee has a great team of baristas , they are so efficient and very friendly. Greater Than Coffee how a warm and relaxing atmosphere. Greater then coffee has a large selection of coffees, teas, and snacks. I've never been disappointed with any item on the menu.",2
"Beautys est un endroit d'enfance pour moi, un souvenir. Mon p u00e8re m'y emmenait d u00e9je u00fbner alors que j' u00e9tais toute jeune. Si je peux me rappeler d'un seul truc, ce sont la qualit u00e9 des bagels au saumon fum u00e9, sans compter leur d u00e9licieux fromage a la cr u00e8me ! J'ai bien h u00e2te d'y retourner et de me replonger dans le temps.",2
"The owner Jeff Dugan is a joke. The worst experience with an unprofessional company they will hang up on you, swear at you and not fix your plumbing problem. We had someone out 3 times for the same thing and the last one looked like the guy who sits at the 1 10 ramp asking for money. Really, worse than a rip off. I would do zero stars if possible. You'd do better calling any other company.",1
"Went to Roaring Fork for happy hour with three of my gal pals. Darrell was our server. Very professional and competent and friendly. Had a few of the happy hour menu items. All were good. I had previously taken clients there for dinner. Fabulous dinner and service so definitely wanted to try the HH. Definitely a place I'd go back, and I'm sure my friends felt the same.",2
"We had the pasta tasting menu, which overall was disappointing. The first two dishes were really good including a black pasta with a touch of jalapeno. The next three courses were all downhill though, culminating in a pate stuffed ravioli that reeked of vinegar. The wine pairings were strange and didn't add anything to the dishes.",1
"Healthy, delicious spa cuisine served for breakfast and lunch tucked away in a spa oasis from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. Located off the lobby of the Canyon Ranch Spa at The Venetian, the decor here is casual yet nice. I had a great breakfast of smoked turkey hash with a poached egg here. Their breakfast menu includes whole wheat pancakes and a variety of omelets amongst other things.",2
"Was in Scottsdale Healthcare and wanted take out lunch. Ordered 2 tacos, one shredded beef, one chicken. The tacos were fantastic. They are the crispy kind but authentic not the cheap crispy kind. If you have ever been to El Toreador in Redmond Washington it was very similar. I would definitely repeat business here.",2
"We ordered pizza delivery half Chicago and half Italiano, although it tooks in total 1 hour , they told us in advance so we were ready to wait. The delivery girl was friendly. The pizza was delicious, but a little pricey its expensive when you add 5 delivery charge. Maybe next time we will pick up or go to the restaurant. I recommend it if you want a good pizza",2
Well tonight I gave sonic another chance and it took over 10 minutes to get our order and out of that line. To find out that they messed up the order and I don't get an apology instead I get irritated teenage girl. Not sure I'll be visiting anytime soon. The great thing is I'll be a lot healthier if I stay away from this fast food joint. And a lot happier without the attitude.,1
My family and I love this place! Their Makaha Roll was onolicious. The uni was fresh and the malasadas reminded me of home. I wouldn't order the Mac salad or pulehu steak though. The service was 5 stars and we got an awesome discount. The best deal in the state is their all you can eat dinner for 35. I tried almost the entire menu!,2
"This show is a blast! Great for families, which isn't the norm for a lot of shows in Vegas. It's was about 80 mins long, which most shows on the strip are 70 90 mins. The guys are super nice, signing anything and everything after the show as well as taking photos with anyone that wants to. If you don't like it that loud, they provide earplugs at the back! o ",2
"I'm here with my company Bridge Property Management. The room I'm in is 1127, super comfy bed, pillows, and linens. My room is clean and in good condition. The staff here is so friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was great! The guy helping our table at breakfast kept my coffee cup full gave me a to go cup full of coffee as well. Super great!",2
"Amazing dinner with friends! Two of my girlfriends and myself met for dinner Saturday evening. What a great experience, everything from the service, recommendations and the FOOD was great. Our server Kara could not have more more pleasant, helpful and fun! We shared 3 apps, seared octopus, crab legs in a jar and frog legs. All outstanding. Would highly recommend giving this cute place a chance!",2
"DO NOT EAT HERE! This place gave my husband food poising! He is violently ill! He ordered the gyro and I got the grilled chicken gyro. I feel fine, but his meal made him go to the hospital. The health department needs to take a closer look at this restaurant's food handing procedures. Again DO NOT EAT HERE.",1
Another satisfied appointment today with Brake Masters. Alignment and oil change on my wife's car. Quick service. No pressure to buy extra things. Dropped the car off and came back just before closing to pick it up. Mentioned their online pricing and was granted those prices without coupons in hand. nGreat work guys. Thanks for all you do to keep drivers and vehicles safe here in the CG area!,2
"I go to Dr. Tran and he's awesome. Everyone in the office from hygienists to the office staff are friendly and welcoming. The office makes you feel like you're part of the family and will take care of you as such. I've always thought that if there was such a thing as an existentialist hell, mine would be going to the dentist, but not anymore!",2
i love this place. i go here for every special occassion. went for my birthday this past march was awesome. great server and great food. only bad thing is that they tend to forget when you ask them to cook the food well done sometimes they dont come back to your table with it since everything is cooked medium. but its still amazing.,2
"I was apprehensive about going here. I really didnt know what to expect. It was a solid buffet, nice spread, great service from our server and good quality of food. I wish I had tried the Village Seafood buffet instead, however walked or should I say waddled out of here satisfied. Id definitely consider going back!",2
"Good, fast alternative for something to take back to your room. The food is tasty, the portions good, and the price is reasonable. An added bonus is that you can have a cocktail while you wait. There was never a crowd when I was there, which, given the food, is a little bit of a mystery. But I was on business mid week.",2
"Why would you have 50 registers and only two open? Its like going to a buffet but being asked to just rad the crackers only. Top it off with tryiing to find a employee to ask questions to, but they're all busy talking and hanging out. The store is usually dirty and the bathrooms often resemble gas station bathrooms.",1
We already have had to move rooms three times first was a accessible room which of course had no tub and moved us to a room with a super old school tv and the tv in the living ro remotes don't works and has super old appliances we had to down grade so annoyed for a 4 star resort o and holes in the walls very classy,1
"Very fun! We went last night to celebrate my 30th bday! 3 girls and 3 very manly men who got lots of surprises while there. It was hilarious. They involve the audience, the drinks are stout, and they make the whole show lively. Hoping next time we come something similar is showing, so we can go see it at the V theatre.",2
"Ordered from them through an online delivery service once last year and despite of the generally good reviews here, the experience was largely disappointing. Food was average and the two delivery kids were acting like clowns. Apart from being able to get food from them later than anyone else, there really was no upside to it.",1
"Hmmm not sure how i would feel about this place. Thanks god we went there during happy hour because i would be sad paying full price for the quality of foods they serve there. nWe ordered new york strip, clams linguini and their famous moscow mule. The steak had no flavor. The linguini tasted old. The clams of course werent fresh. Their moscow mule was a moscow mule.",1
"Honest, friendly, and quick to help you. I like JTs because it is down the street from my house and they care about the products they sell. Like real bike shops, things are expensive, but that is because you are buying quality. If you want a real bike go here or All Mountain.if you are looking for a starter hit up a place like wal mart, sport store or Big 5.",2
this place is creepy. there was a cop standing around patrolling all the pizza eaters last Saturday. what kind of restaurant has police officers parading around to intimidate its patrons? Hire private security like every other establishment. Seriously a cop at 2 in the morning at a pizza place on a Saturday. No thanks.,1
"Awful service. Used to enjoy coming here, will not return. I have had bad service before, and if servers make mistakes and apologize or admit them, I can have sympathy. The server ignored us most of the night, and would not apologize or acknowledge his mistakes. Unhappy with how our experience ended up here and we will not return.",1
"I like barbecue, but I love this place. The brisket is the absolute star of the show. Every time I go to Austin, TX I would hit up Rudy's barbecue. Now we have one in Chandler, AZ. If you haven't had a chance go try this place go! It is not fancy, but the brisket is amazing. I tried all the other items and they are good too.",2
"Met a friend here for happy hour yesterday. Even though it was 90 degrees outside the patio bar was very comfortable. Service was great and the happy hour prices are very reasonable. My favorite sushi was the dragon roll with eel and avocado. The salmon and yellowtail nigiri was very good as well. When the weather is nice, this is the place to be for happy hour.",2
"Been to Lulus all over Phoenix and even Los Angeles, but this one seems to have the friendliest crew! Expensive workout clothes, especially when you know you're just gonna sweat in them but they're most comfy and they last forever! No dryer though or fabric softener, hang dry only. Complimentary hemming which is a plus for short people like me.",2
"The is food great! All dishes have a good ratio of meat vegetables. If you're new to this restaurant, they do give great suggestions. For the vegetarians out there, they have a vegetarian menu that they don't normally present unless you request it. I absolutely love the vegetarian items. Must haves are tofu larb and fresh ginger with steamed tofu. Be sure to finish off with mango sticky rice.",2
"Unusual, exotic fun. Everyone should at least try this place. Great place to experience something different. I went during the Bellydance Hafla, but there are all kinds of events held at Dobra. There are all kinds of nooks to sit and talk, this place is warm and welcoming. Plenty of teas to choose from, wonderful ambiance.",2
"been there a few times, was not bad the first time I went. only complaint I had was their was more side dish than main course. So I felt like I was getting a sample of the main dish curry chicken, goat, etc while paying full price. went again and didn't even finish my meal. I guess they were having an off day with the flavor. So I'll be looking for another restaurant soon.",1
"Several reasons I love Freedom Park 1 It has something for everyone playgrounds, beaucoup de sports fields lots of soccer goals for my husband , well maintained lake and picnic facilities, great jogging trail. 2 Even on crowded weekend days, we've always been able to find a place to spread out a blanket and chill out. 3 Everyone always seems to be having a good time.",2
"Excellent food and service their 9 oz Wagyu American Kobe style rib eye steak is almost too big to finish since it's so marbled with fat., like eating a standard 16 oz steak. Their other main dishes are also excellent including Dover Sole, Maine lobster, etc. I love their coffee doughnut dessert, along with their Banana Creme pie second only to Emeril's sorry! , and their warm chocolate souffle.",2
Challenging greens with unexpected slopes and fairways with tons of surprises. We played the forward tees but the championship tours looked really challenging! Love the lunch that you call in at the 8th hole and then eat on your way to the 10th. Not very much water on the grounds. Overall we had a great experience and we would definitely play this course again or even bring friends to it.,2
"I rarely give a business a superior rating, but I have to say my wife and I had one of the best dining experiences at the Rock Bottom Brewery. The food was delicious, the beer, every recipe sampled, was amazing and the service was wonderful. The staff made us feel like we were the most important guests in the restaurant. Please support this business. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",2
"If you're Asian and love chinese food you will be disappointed by this place. If you have a bland taste for Chinese food then you'll like it. Its a little pricey, but you have to think location. I will say that its better then PF Chang and their service is a lot better. This won't be a place that I go to if I was craving for Chinese food.",1
"A very lovely cheese and souvenir shop. I was very lucky to come across this shop while walking around downtown. They are very helpful, and let me know that the cheese could travel home to LA in my carry on without any ice. So I got to take cheese home to my friend and myself instead of the ""Cow Tipping "" T shirt I had seen at the airport. They get a star for supporting Family Farmers.",2
"My bestie and I rolled up on this spot one random night in the QC, and fell in love at first bite! Stunning decor, tasty food and great prices! It was truly a great dining experience! Need to do it again ASAP! Would love to do a little date there or just kick it with friends. It wasn't too big, but that's why I liked it! Quaint, cute and comfort food! Lol",2
"I'm really surprised on how much people hate on this location. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is pricey. But other than that, I really enjoy just walking around the Grand Canal Shoppes. I think it's fun, and fanciful, which is what Vegas is all about. If you are going to look around for flaws. really? It's sin city. I can find a lot of other things to point out.",2
"This little childhood memory Bar was hidden on a seedy street of downtown las Vegas. Fortunately, I have some native friends that know where to go. It's basically a bar filled with arcade games from the past e.g double dragon, Sega outrun, operation wolf, tappers, x men, marvel vs. capcom, donkey kong, etc. Fun times.",2
"I am finicky and picky. I don't really like buffets. I find the foods usually old, stale, bland.etc. But not this place. The food turns over quickly, it's warm, its clean, there is a huge assortment of food, the salad bar is fresh, the lettuce is crispy. It's actually the best buffet I've ever eaten at, with the exception of maybe the pricier vegas ones. nWay better than any others in the valley.",2
I use Safelite even though they are not in my insurances network. I have had to use them 2 times in the last month to repair rock chips on my front windshield. Once mobile to my work and once at the Henderson location. Both times the employees were very professional and the work was completed fast. My windshield looks great and I plan on continuing to use Safelite for all my vehicles window needs.,2
"I was pretty pumped when I was walking by 32 degrees and I saw ""Tropical Mojito "" after 5 different bars telling me they have all been out of mint! What I missed however, was that it basically came in a slush like form. So although I did enjoy the mint taste, I wasn't necessarily a huge fan of the tropical part of it. Either way, not terrible!",2
My girlfriend and I love to come here when I visit from California. This is my third time here and I really enjoy the atmosphere. The food is decent and the service is great if you are a fan of Americanized on the cheap side Mexican food then this is the place for you. It's our tradition to come here and I can't wait to come back.,2
"Holy beautiful! I suppose this review isn't quite fair, because I didn't stay there, nor did I spend any real time here.we simply tried to find Pete Rose to get an autograph. Pete Rose doesn't sign here anymore, but the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. The sculptures, the carvings, the art all spectacular! The ceiling is phenomenal!.puts the Paris' to shame!",2
"Two words Taco Tuesday. It's so good it even alliterates. It's so good that it's just a dollar. Or maybe that's what makes it even better. But even when it's not a Tuesday, this place is excellent. Deeeeelicious tacos, tons of vegetarian food, super quick service everything is too awesome. Especially when it's Taco Tuesday.",2
I came here for the first time tonight and was not disappointed! The food is pretty cheap and tasty. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with fries and my boyfriend ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. I really liked them both except for the fact that the pickles on my sandwich tasted more like cucumbers to me. Everyone was really friendly and the food came out very fast!,2
"Caitlin is the best! She is 100 reliable and my dog loves her. She has been flexible and always gives me a report of how my pup did on the walk. Unlike other companies I tried, take paws actually walks my dog. They really spend time with him. Take Paws has been walking my dog for about 6 months and I could not be happier with the service.",2
"Quicken Loans somehow got ahold of my work number and is inundating me with mortgage refinance offer calls and voicemails. They are jeopardizing my ability to make an income to pay my existing mortgage. Good rates or not, their hounding tactics may me want to stay far away from them. They treat sales like hard core collections. TERRIBLE",1
"Came in here a few months back bought a few bikes, everyone here is super helpful and accommodating. They let you know everything you need to know, about their toys. They carry pit bikes, scooters to motorcycles. How they let someone test drive the bikes is a nice touch to the awesome store. I've been coming back every since the first time back in October just because the experience. Thanks guys!",2
Thank god for Starbucks at 5 30am. I was on my way into work and was in dire need of a wake me up and some breakfast. I stopped in hoping on a Saturday Starbucks was open and sure enough I was saved. I got a Venti Caramel Macchiato and a piece of coffee cake. Both items were exactly what I needed to get me going this morning and keep me awake through my workday. Starbucks you saved me once again.,2
"My wife's favorite Italian spot. She loves the penne ala vodka, made with pepper vodka! Fresh baked bread is amazing. Tried a slice ifU daughters pizza, very good! Service is usually really good. The last time we were there the server was slow but very friendly. I would put this in the top 5 Italian eateries in Charlotte.",2
"My friend recommended that I came here for lunch today, and I was very pleased at the quality of the meal. I ordered the Smoked Burger, and I can compare it to BRGR or Burgatory. The onion straws were perfect, and the barbecue sauce gave it a delicious flavor. I can't wait to come back again sometime.",2
"Like their freaky fast subs. BUT SO.MANY.DRUNK.KIDS. And by kids I mean fellow ASU students whose parents just let them off their leash to run wild around ASU. This is the local drunk food hotspot on any Vuesday Tuesday , Thirsty Thursday, Friday, Sat or Sun. Doesn't matter if it's 10am or 12am, you'll spot at least one girl stumbling through their doors.",2
"This is a great establishment with a wide craft beer selection in the East Valley. I have had food a couple of times, but usually I just go for drinks. Nice large, rotating selection of beers on tap and some good bottles. No carry out license so if you do get a bigger bottle you have to drink it there.",2
"If I could give negative stars to this place I would. The chilaquiles were so horrible not only did I not eat them I wouldn't give them to a homeless person. They were cold and soggy. The service was so extremely horrible we waited 30 minutes for our drinks. Our food was cold. We came on New Year's Day for brunch, it was not overcrowded and this will defiantly be the last time ever!",1
Dr. Lidieth Libby and her staff are so awesome! She treats my special needs child with such great care! She has special treats for the kids like movie tickets and drawings for kids who have no cavities.my daughter is not afraid to go to her appointments! This is amazing! We drive a long way for the excellent service they provide! Dr. Libby really cares about her kids and it shows!,2
"I love the milkshakes here. I've tried almost all of them, got one more to try! nThe burger and fries were good. reminded me of I Out which is a good thing for me . nAnother time tried the tacos and it didn't mesh with my palate, I thought they were too sweet. nBut I will be back for burgers and fries and of course the milkshakes!",2
First time there and sat at the bar. At first we were over whelmed by the customer service two waitress helping us out then after awhile there was absolutely no one we could get to order a second drink. We waited about 20 mins just to get our bill and to leave after waving down someone. The place was busy and I had ordered a sample drink but after getting no service we decided to leave.,1
"New location is HORRIBLE! It's totally schipzophrinic competing with the blaring music from R R across the street. Why, why, why change something that was so perfect?! Patio feels too new and concrete. Best things on the menu are gone. Total fail! Should've left it where it was and put the new restaurant in the new location. FAIL",1
This place has amazing steaks. The service is always great as well. You definitely get what you pay for in the steak department. However as great as the steaks are this place could improve the salads and sides. I feel this restaurant could be tops if they match up the quality of the sides to that of the steaks.,2
Why oh why does this location stink? I love Jasons Deli in Boca Park. That has been our meet for lunch spot for years. Tomato soup and salad bar for all of us. This location is just confused and the food is not the same. My son has ordered the same sandwich 3 times here and it has been wrong all 3 times. It's too expensive to be so messed up. This is just a few blocks from home too.,1
This place is so great! They are always so friendly and get you in as quickly as they can if you don't have an appointment. They always do an amazing job that lasts a long time. I have takeumerous friends here and everyone I have taken has loved it. It is very inexpensive for the quality of service you get!,2
"Been here one, and I'm gonna go out of m way to say that this place is probably going to be out go to AYCE Sushi joint. friendly staff, attentive, a nice ambiance, AWESOME food too! Although I must say I've never been a fan of time limits on AYCE, but I guess people can and do take advantage of it. And the fact that out kid don't eat for free I just made myself crave for some sushi",2
"great selection, great customer service, nice people. I bought a pair of boots here that about halfway through a day of wearing them, I discovered they were not the same. right boot was kind of irregular. Even though they had been worn outside, they took them back no questions asked, and were very nice and helpful selecting another pair to replace them.",2
"Ordered a banana nut muffin, received a blueberry muffin. When I spoke with the manager, she rudely asked me if I wanted blue berry or banana, when clearly I'm returning to exchange the blue berry muffin. Food was decent, just poor attitude service when confronted about the issue of an error on their part. Probably would not come back to this specific location.",1
"Great little spot in South Park, by the same owners as Big Daddy's. Has that same feel to it but with a Tex Mex flare. The salsa is a bit different, in that they serve it warm as opposed to cold or room temp. It's different, but good. Had the Beef Brisket Taco's and they were amazing! Get them on the homemade soft tortillas. Yum.",2
"Delish! just like the one in LA. So much stuff to try on the menu. All tempting, all rather exceptional. The dessert selections alone is worth a separate special visit. Fun part located in Venetian Casino Hotel Resort. Open 24hrs. Great news for when you might get arm cramp from yanking those slot machines too long.",2
" 9 for a tube? are you kidding? i also asked to use a wrench and they wouldn't let me b c of ""insurance "" reasons. if i am buying a bike tube, i know how to take my wheel off and replace the tube. they tried to charge me to have it replaced but i opted to take a walk home and do it myself. terrible service, terrible prices.",1
First impression says a lot.Employee cooking food that was located right by the door wasn't what you call customer friendly. Then I asked her about one of their products and she says I don't know. If you work there you should know! Not ntoo thrilled. I didn't buy anything from there either. Their onion rings looked good on a customers plate thought! I'd rather go to Penn Station!,1
"I was not impressed. The atmosphere is alright, but nothing special. The service was alright, and our waitress seemed to be a little off. She was unsure on what came with different entrees. The pricing seems a little high for the area too. I had Lobster Mac N Cheese and it was pretty good. I felt that there are other places I could have paid the same price and enjoyed myself more.",1
I came here with my family and what amazing service! I loved the flatbread pizzas you can't get any better! My wife and me shared a French dip and I've never had better. The horseradish sauce was really mild but that's why it was so good! I would deff recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal! It's good for family or friends,2
"I really like this place. They have great food. I usually order the spicy chicken basil. They provide a number system from 0 10. 5 is pretty hot. My friends who like hot, order the 5 level. You seem to get a little more food by dining in. Recently they changed to smaller ""to go "" containers. The people there are friendly and helful. Their mochi is awesome.",2
I was very apprehensive about a new salon since I have had the same stylist for the last nine years. Tara greeted me warmly and listened as I explained this to her. She understood what I was feeling and proceeded to give me just the cut I wanted and like. I will patronize Tara for certain. Excellent service and reasonable prices. Tara is my stylist for as long as she'll have me!,2
"Pink's is nothing special, but they're good. I like the wide variety of toppings. C'mon, it's hot dogs! I didn't expect a mind blowing experience. It's just a place you have to stop by when you're in Vegas, especially when you're drunk and or wanting a cheap and quick bite. They're cheap considering the area.",2
"Just tried this place for take out. We ordered pizza for the kids ,cheese steak sandwich for me and the Italian sandwich for my wife. We were very happy with our meals. I have never had a cheese steak in Philadelphia.yet but I imagine it would taste like the one I just ate. Best I have had so far. We will be going back",2
Tried this place out because it was near our house and our favorite spot is across town. The service was great and the restaurant looked very clean. The non spicy pad Thai was a little spicy for my girlfriends taste but still tasted good. The fried rice however had me sick all day the following day. Looks like we will be sticking to our favorite spot across town.,1
My daughter in law picked this place via yelp reviews and gotta say Loved the rooms and the service. Only two issues. I stayed near poolside and the band was loud and not so good. Lot of n20 party people in the pool being 20 which kept us from ntaking the kids into the pool. Much quieter and low key after ndark.,2
"I have been to this Sonic several times and more often thaot their credit card system is down. The problem is once you pull in the drive thru you are stuck. So you dont get the treat you wanted and you have to sit there. So annoying. So the moral of the story is, if you come to this Sonic make sure you have cash or it is a waste of your time.",1
"Like the fact it is open 24 hours. My wife and went there over Labor Day weekend and had the shrimp app and a steak burrito. Everything was perfect, had enough burrito to share and take back to hotel. Had no problem using the groupon. Our server gave us some utensils to take back also. Definitely recommend",2
"BAR ONLY REVIEW. n2 Star Beer, 3 Star Cocktails, 1 Star Service. Sorry to beat a dead horse but avoid this place if possible. That being said if you need a drink at Tempe Marketplace your options are limited and this is normally the only bar with empty seats in the whole marketplace on Fri Sat nights.",1
Ahhhh I am a environmentalist and animal rights advocate and recently they have included dead animals which is not good for the environment or animal rights I think the chicken is factory farmed.Also the heavier the dish the more expensive it is. Too much sugar in their sweets.Agh Le Commensal has become sooo corporate and greedy.The managers are mean.,1
"I thought that Cafe Lago would've been amazing because it's in Caesar's Palace, but no. We all had maybe one plate and were done. The crab legs weren't cut in half so it took forever to crack each leg individually. I know, I'm lazy. But hey, if the lower end buffets are offering it, you think they would as well! Waste of money, waste of time. Will not go back.",1
"the pizza is really good once in awhile, i order their pepperoni and it is really good when it is hot because you can see all the grease floating on top and the cheese is melted and sticks to the roof of my mouth. It hurts but that's why they make water! The buffet is about 6' feet long and I don't think it is worth the money. I only buy the pizza if I have a coupon.",1
"This store has it all! Great supplies, wonderful variety, excellent staff, and interesting classes, plus a large work space for cropping on Friday nights. nIf they don't have what you need, Debbie can see if she can order it for you. nI love this store! Hope all paper crafters will visit and give Family Memories your business.",2
"Excellent wash for the toys and their hauler!. Be sure to bring your own hose and planning your RV wash will pay off. There are stations on both sides of the RV Bay, but a well planned attack with a talented helper and you can get most of both sides with one station. 5 for dump fee beats most places. Great wash.",2
"I have gone here a lot since high school and have always loved this place. It's cheeky and nerdy, and it's a local place to pay for cheaper 3 movies and concessions. I love going here, and getting out of the sticky, mainstream theaters. Just be advised, cash only. But that's okay because that's what I learned in San Francisco.",2
"THE BEST FOOD IN THE VALLEY HANDS DOWN! I have been searching for years and I have finally found it. I have never had anything that I did not love. I don't even care about the groceries, I go straight for the restaurant in the back! One of the reasons, I can't move from Henderson is because Cuevas will be too far away. Cannot be beat!",2
"Very cool little spot! Books, stationary, cards, candles and all types of little fabulous finds! Great for those days when you have a little money but everything you need already. and just want to look around. You will ALWAYS find something in there that you can use in your place! Staff is great too! And they keep the best and most current magazines! I def recommend!",2
"My kids grew up going to this park, it's AMAZING. We go every Christmas, and although it's packed, it's awesome. The train ride is well worth the wait during Christmas, and the rest of the year there's usually not much of a line. The prices are unbeatable. The kids love the parks and getting ice cream. I love the history, and FDR's train is pretty impressive. Do not miss this place!",2
"The decor was cute and the emphasis and the macaroons was nice nThe mint gelato had a wonderful minty flavor and the gelato hit a wonderful place between gelato and ice cream. The waffle cone was good. Nice crunch and flavor. nThe macaroons are delightful, delicate ad full of flavor. I'm glad I packed some to take home",2
"So, bumped them down due to the fact that I realized my pinky was put on way crooked. Like. Obviously crooked. My pinky is typically overshadowed by my rings ring finger, so I didn't notice it right away.I don't know HOW I missed it, but I did. Arrrrggghhh. But, a week and a half later and all my fingers are still intact and none have fallen off. We'll see how long that takes.",1
This particular SB is the weakest in the area. The space is small and during winter it is freezing as every time someone enters they bring the outside climate in with them. There's also a small group of loud obnoxious old guys who dominate the soft chairs every morning doing their crosswords and screaming about inane facts and new stories.,1
"I've never been inside, but I've ordered a billion pizzas. They're all delicious. It can take a minute for delivery, but I've never been disappointed with a Caliente pizza, and that's all my rating needs to be. The missing star is to make room for whatever I might be missing about beer and the ambience inside sorry, guys.",2
"Scotland, your food continues to disappoint me. The food at Caf u00e9 Jacques was incredibly bland, the bread was a little soggy, it was made fresh but tasted like it had been sitting in a food cabinet all day. The coffee is awful, please don't even attempt it but i've given 1 star for the smoothie which was drinkable.",1
The attitude and service provided by our server was subpar at best. We felt as though we were an inconvenience. Short one word answers and at one point she simply pointed at the menu and walked away. We waited so long for a second beverage I just went to the bar. Food was average at best. 1st and only visit that's for certain.,1
"I'll never eat here again. The sushi was cold, the rolls didn't taste good and the service sucked. I ordered 4 different rolls, ate only one of each, told the server I didn't like any of them, and she just laughed but would not take them off the bill despite me not eating anything further. Also extremely over priced. There are plenty of great places to eat sushi in Vegas this is NOT one of them.",1
"Go there, go there, GO THERE! Delicious steak and shrimp, great decor and clean, clean, clean. Even the casino part smelled fantastic and everyone was super friendly. Really weird since it was right off of filthy Fremont st. From the outside it looks crappy but take my advice, if you want to be treated nice without the fear of getting some bacterial infection, go to this place.",2
"Is this you Staying in Fremont area or work downtown and need some good grub, but you don't want McDonald's? Walk your butt up to Binion's, and head inside to the deli with the stools. Not the cafe Great handmade sandwiches for 7. Boar's Head fixin's, comes with potato salad and a pickle. Thumbs up.",2
"another restaurant i can cross off my list. for more than a decade, the food has been great. tonight we sat at a table and our guest started rummaging through her purse and the jackass manager runs over and says ""did you put something in your purse? "". really? like we are going steal a salt shaker? wtf? we walked and will never eat there again.",1
"I stay right down the street and love this location. It is only 85 cents for a 32 ounce soda. There is no bathroom for general use unfortunately, but that is common in a lot of places. The employees are pretty friendly and seem to enjoy their job. I love their two for a dollar hot dogs! That cannot be beat!",2
"Personally I really didn't care for this place. Everyone was telling my how amazing it is and i just didn't taste it. I think they had way to many bbq sauces. Some people like that, but i think you know it is going to be a good bbq place, when the place has one famous sauce. One thing i loved on that menu was the twice backed casserole. It was so good. As for the bbq itself, i wouldn't go again.",1
"Worst steak I ever had,I had the New York strip,my wife had the fillet mignon, we shared a lobster bisque ,asparagus,and cream of spinach. Great place atmosphere servers all the way down to the barbacks. The next morning I had stomach cramps,and sick as a dog.i couldn't e,at for two days,just starting to feel better.i hate you MASTROS.",1
"Big 5 reminds me of Big Lots of sporting goods. It's a bit jumbly and messy, and the quality is middle ground to low end. So alot of the items here would be cheaper, fine if you want a headlamp that's just good enough to eat your meal in the dark while camping or cheap snowboarding gear to start with let's say.",1
"Really yummy filipino food! Whenever I come, there is always music playing via customers singing karaoke or doing some type of ballroom dance. Portions are large and they offer a wide range of the filipino cuisine. And if you come during happy hour appetizers are really cheap. Guava juice, tapsilog, kare kare, and sisig. Yum! They also have all the til tilan or like sauces if you want them haha.",2
"I had their buffet brunch weekday which was very reasonably priced I think it was 23? And this included a complimentary mimosa bloody mary. Everything was really good except oddly enough I wished the portions were smaller. I know who complains abut that?! But since everything tasted so good, I wanted to sample everything without wasting food.",2
Went here today at 8 30 to get a piercing online it says they close at 9 and the doors were locked. A guy comes to the door and said that they closed for the night 30mins early . He was very rude and I will not return. This is after going there to get my belly button pierced last year and it being off centered and crooked. I never should've gave them a 2nd chance after that.,1
"I liked the experience at Bacaro. The menu featured interesting foods and preparations, the service was excellent, and the wine list was good. Coming from Chicago, I'm spoiled with the level of cuisine we can experience on a regular basis. Although this restaurant wasn't quite on the level of Chicago, it was very, very good!",2
"Women in baggage claim lied about where my bag was as they wouldn't even look it up in their computer. After burping Chinese food in my face and refusing to look in the computer I accepted what they were telling me only to arrive at my destination bag less. Unprofessional, lazy and making a bad name for the South.",1
Tried the Mafia Cono and the caramel apple pie dessert cono. Both were delicious. We had a Groupon so the cono came with fries. We were stuffed. The Mafia Cono is like a slice of meat lovers pizza. Very good and the service was great. Next time I want to try the other dessert cono and the white pizza.,2
"Ok, I do not see what all the hoopla is about. The burger was better than fast food but inferior to Smash or Five Guys. I was not impressed at all. Went during a normal lunch hour and service was average. Not bad, just normal. Again, not a fan of this place, hard to understand what the deal is with this one.",1
"Come for the incredible beer selection, stay for the trivia on Tuesdays at 7 30! , and ignore the occasionally questionable service and this will surely become one of your favorite bars in Greenfield not that there are too many others to choose from, but I digress. Go in thirsty and with a good attitude and you'll surely have a positive experience.",2
Hubbz took me right before they closed we didnt know it was last minute but the staff was still super friendly not all moody because we sat down a half hour before closing. We ordered quickly and the food was amazing! Happy hour wasnt bad either! I will be returning. but this time a lot earlier so i can enjoy my food lol,2
"What used to be a great place has went to hell since Ryan, Andrew Mike were squeezed out.food that used to be pretty good is now very poor, most of the old help bartenders have left, and an 85 RATING! ! .SERIOUSLY!.with all the great places in that area is there really any reason to go here anymore?",1
"This is a good guitar center. It wasn't too noisy or overcrowded as guitar centers are wont to be, and the workers were super friendly and knowledgeable. Good selection of the common guitar center endorsed brands. Used gear was available but not a ton of selection there, but enough that I'll be back to take another look.",2
"Good food here! The typical southern cuisine was in full effect! Had the smoked chicken and baked beans with Mac n cheese overall good experience here. My only gripe is there's not that much seating here, and the staff sat by and allowed airport employees to take up paying customers seats. They sat and watched the football game. Not acceptable!",1
I am addicted to the grilled chicken and fruit salad. It is low cal if you use the low cal dressing and very filling. The staff will go out of their way to get things right and make your experience a positive one. I buy the nugget trays too when I am having guests and it is always the first thing to be finished.,2
"Excellent ice cream shop. Customer service is top notch. Very friendly and welcoming! Great decor and a bunch of table top games to play with family or friends while you enjoy some Thrifty ice cream or one of their other great, unique creations. Monday nights are 1 scoops as well, and they are more often thaot generous in their scoop sizes.",2
Not worth it. I've eaten the kabobs here before and they were pretty good but nothing great. Most recently I tried the Falafel. I have to say it was not good at all. Granted it was only 5 bucks but not worth wasting my dinner on it. It was burnt to a crisp and lacked any real flavor. I have had a better Falafel at an American mom and pop place in Charlotte vs. this restaurant.,1
"Look when it's 109 outside and the air conditioning is broken, nothing taste good. It was our first and last time to eat there! It's simple, if your air conditioning is out, put a note on the door and ask the customers to come back and they will come back. Make them eat in a hot, hot place and they will not be back!",1
"This is a wonderful business with the BEST realtors in Las Vegas. They worked with me to find my home from 1100 mikes away. Everything went smoothly, and we are looking forward to doing business with them again. High quality service with personable people what more could you ask for? Recommend highly!",2
Went to firefly with homies for a bday dinner. Have to say the customer service was on point with them constantly checking up on us. The food was priced well and came out fast. Definitely had some favorites but I feel like if you know what to order this place is bomb. Way better than overpaying at the strip. Would be back for sure.,2
"This place is always so good. We shared a plate and it was more than enough food. The portions are generous. Our waitress, Kristina was excellent. She was very attentive, up sold without being pushy and anticipated our needs. The next time we come we will be sharing a plate and ask to sit in Kristine's section.",2
"Sit Stay Pet sitting is the best company to have watch your pets, while your away! The entire company treats your pets like their own, they offer sleep overs as well which is wonderful. I wouldn't have anyone else watch my cat while I'm away! I am updated with pictures and texts while away as well.feels so good to know my pet is being treated so wonderfully!",2
The associates at this store are very friendly and helpful. From the moment I walked in at the door to when I checked out I was greeted and it was a speedy check out.when I had questions I got an answer right away. They have great customer service. They had all the items that I needed. I will return to this location.,2
"Manager Jana is totally unprofessional with the employees. She can often be found outside smoking while there is a line inside. When she does come in, she yells at the employees for not working faster. One day, a guy came to the counter and complained about his order. She not only was rude to the guy but also made homophobic comments about him to one of her employees. Highly not recommended.",1
Just got all my windows replaced by AZ Best Windows. Robert was great to work with and his price was very good. Before you go to Lowes or Home Depot give Rob a call. He will beat their prices hands down. Plus he actually does the install! No sub contractors here. I highly recommend Rob and Arizona's Nest Windows!,2
Love love love this place! Everyone is amazing here. Especially my doll TINA! Go get nailed by Tina! My new favorite place. I literally left my old nail salon which I had gone to for over 4 year bc of her. Beautiful environment and great people. nSAD TO REPORT I WILL NO LONGER COME HERE. VERU DISAPPOINTED. STILL HAVING SKIN ISSUES. GROSS,1
"Does not accept credit or debit. Food is old and very chewy. Buffett sits in dark corner of room. Dont waste your money trust me. Very disappointing. nThe owner shoed us in and said help yourselves and walked back into the scary looking kitchen. nThe thai tea with cream was good though. The place looks like it has potential, but they definitely gave up!",1
"Friend recommend this place to me over a year ago and I love it. It's a small bar in Henderson. Best pizza in town I think. Always packed but I've always have great service. The owner or manager comes out once on a while and ask how everything is. Bartenders are really nice, chit chatting with everyone.",2
"We received an upgrade due to overbooking at the hotel. The suite was aesthetically pleasing. However, the bathroom had a weird sewage smell and the shower water puddled at my feet even after calling maintenance. Everything was nice to look at in the room but definitely not as functional as it should be.",1
"I love pink box. Their donuts are ridiculously delicious, every time I have tried them they taste fresh, and there are some really innovative donuts here! I am a huge fan of their breakfast cereal donuts, their fruity pebble cake doughnuts are too delicious. Also, if it's Fall and they're serving their pumpkin spice donuts, you need to buy one. Or three.",2
"I would do my owails before going back there. They appear indifferent and slovenly. When the ""nail tech "" got out her acrylic, it looked like it hadn't been used in months covered in dust. I shudder to think about the hygiene of their foot baths. There are dozens of nail salons in the valley, so don't settle. The cost is comparable to the nice salons, so you're not even saving.",1
"I have no idea why anyone gave this more than 1 star.basically this was just a show of boobs and men kissing men.which is fine in vegas, but circ shows are usually more grand and have awe inspiring acrobatics. The best acts were a contortionist and a strong man on a pole. Absinthe is similar but MUCH more affordable and more impressive. Save your money on this one.",1
We set a reservation for 6 and the place was not too crowded when we arrived on a Wednesday night. The tofu salad was terrific. The yellowtail tar tar is not to be missed. I really enjoyed the udooodle soup which came with three bowls so we could share. We finished with the honey toast which is simple and delicious. With the late night hours I fear we might become regulars.,2
"Skimpy tacos and only OK salsa, combined with the fact that an employee used the bathroom and resumed behind the counter without a hand washing, made this the worst America's experience I have ever had. The only redeeming quality were the chips, until we got to the bottom of the basket and found a hair!",1
Went to tropical smoothie yesterday and loved it. Had a wrap and a strawberry banana smoothie. Didn't even know that they served food. The wrap was on point! Smoothie was very comparable to Jamba.which is a good thing. Service was fast and Sarah at the cashier was a lot of help. She even gave me an extra cup for the extra from the smoothie. Going back for sure. Joe,2
"I rented their package of 6 items for when my sister, niece and nephew were visiting. They dropped everything off at my front door and picked it up when we were done. It was so easy! The quality of the rentals were good and everything came very clean. I would definitely use again for visiting friends and relatives!",2
"I love Brushfire! I go there on the regular for breakfast burritos and tacos! It's the bomb! sometimes I roll there for a light 1 taco, rice and beans dinner and then get a Redbox to unwind. Sometimes when I show up to work w my brown bag breakfast from Brushfire, I be like ""This some good gourmet s t right here!.go get you Sum! "" Fo real D",2
"How can I explain the 3 different waiters we had and the 40 minute wait? Well, we were told our order was cancelled but it had been put in again. Oh, but don't worry because you ordered a medium rare burger and it doesn't take long. All in all, this place is expensive mediocre food but crappy service. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!",1
"I love this place! The rooms are really nice and the amenities are awesome! They have game rooms for the kids and faults too. There's always something to do here! The pools are nice and the water slides are way fun! It's very family oriented. My only complaint is the food here. I wasn't impressed, but besides that's it's an awesome resort!",2
"Selection deserves five stars, the prices are great, the variety is great I buy chocolate here! Also get water, styrofoam coolers, and juust about anything you can think of , the staff is more or less great, and the Twitter account Total Wine , in addition to being generally awesome, can do stock checks for you! I love this place.",2
"While waiting for my next flight, I decided to head to Salsarita's since I was craving Mexican food, and didn't want the typical fast food burger or Starbuck's. I ordered steak tacos with a side of chips and salsa. The steak tacos tasted weird almost as if the steak was pork. The chips and salsa were ok, nothing special.",1
"Espresso is just average, not sure if it's their maching or whether the beans were old but it had a burnt flavor that I didn't care for and I went on 3 different occasions. Because it's right next to the main floor, it gets very crowded and feels more like a cattle car at times. Still on the lookout for a great place to get my espresso fix in the morning at The Venetian.",1
"To start with the positive, this place has amazing atmosphere. This is the only reason. I can imagine for the high star reviews. The one star is for the environment, the food is waaaay back on the negative scale. I had the pollo fundido. It was baaad. I felt ill before even leaving the place and I am really hoping it doesn't get worse.",1
"A regular hangout during my graduate school years, Dee's was always a mixture of folk, from the college crowd to punk rockers, metal heads to the local pubbies. Often a place we were seen post dinner, pre Bar 11 which isn't in the Yelp listings, but worth finding if it's still there and were many billiards were shot, shots taken and songs chosen from a jukebox. Beer cheap, Southside fun. Try it.",2
"Where do I start, this place has the worse Chinese food I have ever had. The egg drop was tasteless and was like water, the Mongolian beef had a sour taste and when I called and asked if they had REAL EGG ROLLS they said yes and once again it's a SPRING ROLL do people NOT know what an egg roll is. 30 down the drain.",1
I have been to thai me up at least a dozen times now and it only gets better and better. I always get the pad thai which is my favorite I have ever had. I have also had the steamed dumplings which are great. Don't forget to BYOB. You can bring your own wine with just a small corkage fee. All of the meals are under 12 dollars and delicious. My buddies also really like their pineapple fried rice.,2
"This place is called Griddlecakes now. Small spot in a good location. My wife got sausage and eggs and I got the meat lovers skillet. Both came out quickly and both were good. We didn't order anything too elaborate, but food was good and atmosphere was mellow. Would recommend it for a casual breakfast or lunch",2
"They got Roaches! Me and two other friends seen two baby roaches crawling on the glass display case. If I could, I would give this place 10 stars for being dirty. If you want some decent pizza with the possibility of a roach on the side, Gus's pizza is the place for you. I hope they read this so they can clean up their act. Disgusting.",1
"Triple Sports is the real deal 'mom pop' small business. Brian and Kara are always so helpful and they do a great job of remembering their customers, and have a genuine interest in all things triathlon. I love going in and just looking around. Its also next to The Coffee Bean, so make an afternoon of it!",2
"We love Matt's Big Breakfast. We have been going there for Sunday morning breakfast off and on for years. We love the waitstaff and the owner. We each get our favorite thing breakfast sandwich, waffle and bacon and the scramble special. The only downside about the place is that it is busy and there can be a wait. but it is only because the food is great and people feel like it is worth the effort.",2
"The Maki Sushi rolls at RA were slap yo mama good! It tasted like avocado, rice, and crab had a party in my mouth. I have a pretty sophisticated pallet and was a bit skeptical that the quality of the California roll here could surpass that of my local H.E.B. Grocery store. But it did! And I loved it.",2
"Food was good but I was quite surprised when my Gin Martini got delivered and the lemon twist floating in it still had the sticker from the grocery store orchard.clearly the bartender that peeled the twist and rimmed the glass with it, as well as the server that brought it didn't think twice about the fact that there was blatantly a large sticker that said, ""Sunkist "" floating in the drink as well",1
"Not worth it. Cute atmosphere, turkey sandwich wasn't bad but grilled cheese was very plain and not worth 13. Came in at 1am to get food to go and took over 30 minutes and they were already out of the first three things we tried to order on the menu. First server behind the bar wasn't very friendly, which kind of set the tone. Second blonde male server that assisted us was better.",1
I saw the sign for this new place when I was walking on Walnut St and decided to make an appt. I got waxing. Super clean which is of course so important! The owner did a great job quick and painless. Great service! And really enjoyed the ambiance! Highly recommend this place and will be going back soon,2
"YUM! Came here for lunch after a late night of drinking and LOVED the lunch pre fix menu. First of all, my friend came here almost 6 months ago around the same time and the server remembered her and her order. MAJOR kudos for that. Miso soup, tonkatsu ramen and the spicy tuna ALL hit the spot. 25? Total steal. I'm absolutely will be back when I'm in Vegas.",2
"OK. I want to give more stars here because the people are very nice! BUT the food. um. where do I start. salty Tonkatsu. the meat was thinner than the breaded part. the Miso soup had like 1.5 time too much miso. The rice was stinky and the salad was a little old. The best part was the standard ""out of the box "" green tea ice cream. This is not authentic Japanese food!",1
"This is the worst overpriced Chinese ever. Authentic, overlooked, tough, extra fatty, cheap cuts of meat and not very good service. Place was empty and they couldn't have rushed me more. nOffered me rice, then charged me 4.35 for it! Huh? nI would highly recommend going hungry over trying to eat this terrible overpriced food.",1
"Whoa what happened! I used to goto this place weekly, but the new owners really messed up a good thing. Prices have almost doubled and the food is not as good as before. Also after a 20 min wait they still managed to bring me the wrong food, same for my wife's order. Too bad as this was my go to place for lunch. Sorry 8 bucks for a small rice bowl is not worth it.",1
"came during the lunch hour and no one was here. that should have been my clue. the teriyaki chicken was dry and hard on the edges. the chicken lo mein was super salty. the egg rolls tasted old. nthe only good thing about the place was the nice Asian couple that worked there, very polite and caring however that doesn't make up for their lack of culinary skills.",1
"Very high gas prices at this convenient location. Clean, nice place, but I'm giving it only 2 stars for the gas prices. You can get Tonto passes for camping here, about the only place in the area where you can Besides Big 5 on Northsight . Arco down the street has the best gas prices around this area.",1
"Not the first thing people think of when they think Las Vegas but it's a hidden gem. More tourists should check it out. Of course, it's also a nice place for locals. Complete with museums, a garden, walking trails, bike rentals, seasonal and holiday events, changing exhibits, and a cafe that offers a delicious variety. There is plenty to see and do here.",2
"Loved this place. But do wait to be seated, They are serious about the justin bieber music, or the hard looks. The food is just yummy! I had the bbq ribs, yes the whole rack. AMAZINGLY good and tender! I also tried The beef briskets, mac and cheese, the chicken, and of course the fried pickles, and Everything was just good.",2
This place has the best poutine in Montreal. A local friend of mine brought me here and it was the most mindmelting experience of my life. We got the ground beef and sausage poutines and I have to say that I have never had poutine as good as what I've had here. The environment is nice and I'd definitely suggest bringing any visitors to the city here.,2
"I do not recommend this McDonald's to anyone. This McDonald's is always dirty. Every time I come here they somehow get my order wrong. I decided to give it one more shot today since it was on my way, but yet again I have been let down. The receipt taped to the bag said the correct items on it, but somehow they couldn't get the correct food into the bag.",1
"RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED! You can go to Panda Express RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET, get 3X more AND pay less. Seriously, chow mein for 12 that comes in a little to go box?! HIGHWAY ROBBERY! and it didn't even taste THAT GREAT! nI got home and realized they didn't even pack utensils or a napkin. Miffed. I should have known when I took a look at their to go menu.",1
"I used to love this place, i dont kbow what changed, but the food tasted horrible, and when I tried to return a Salmon that the flavor was too strong and I hardly ever return anything and we didnt like it, waitresd called me a thief. At the end , they dindt charge me for the salmon but they say I was steeling",1
The wait staff is very friendly here nThis is one of the better Denny's around nIt probably has to do with putting up with those college students nAll the employees seem to be patient nI do like this location more than the one on Univ and the 143. Order time here is quick and our meals arrived in a quick timely manner nFood was good nI stuck with the value slam because I am not that hungry,2
"The setup, location and offerings here look promising. I'm looking forward to making another trip in the future. I was here with my wife and some friends for a Yelp event so my experience was limited but promising. I'll definitely add more detail if when we make it back to that side of town to try it again.",2
"Her name is Beth, she is the rudest person in the company! Don't know how to get my word across, but she helped me numerous of times in one night and she was a rude person that would not direct me to a cab to safely take me home. Therefore I will not ever be using discount cab again in my life. This is why she gets one star! Because she sucks! As well as the overall service.",1
"It looks like they are thinking of giving this place a facelift but it needed one a decade ago. Sad to say, the other reviews are mostly correct, and the pictures are consistent with my experience. Booked through hotels.com, which gave this place 3 stars, I will be sure to leave some feedback with them.",1
"Wayyyy too packed at Nikki Beach. Tip Be sure to find a promoter to get in for free, cause I don't think it'd be worth it to pay. We went on a Saturday afternoon. Nikki Beach looks nice, I like the all white theme and intimate environment. However, the pool is so small and it was so packed. We couldn't find space for our party of 15 , so we decided to just hang out at the regular pool.",1
"This place is awesome! If you're from the islands or want to know how people from Hawaii eat, you should eat here. The vibe is nice, however they don't take reservations, so make sure everyone's there when you walk in the building. I had their Portuguese sausage and eggs with garlic rice. They do put a lot of garlic so BEWARE! Also the staff was really nice.",2
"Worker wasn't wearing gloves, the food was like McDonald's only an expensive version of it, patties are paper thin and the fries taste like the frozen ones you buy at Wal Mart. If you want to over spend for the same burger you can get at McDonald's then come on over! Reviews are obviously written by people who know management, don't trust it!",1
Went back with a close friend who never has been to las vegas and wanted to see a local place and he was very impressed with the food and wine list. amazing again. nservice was attentive enough without being over bearing. went on a monday night around 545 and by the time we left at 715 it was packed.,2
"These guys clearly think they're all celebrities. I wasn't greeted by a single employee and while looking at watches four employees were more interested in playing guitar than helping me. I was really disappointed. Glad I went, but I wouldn't shop here. Ooh, it wasn't very busy when I was there.so that's not an excuse. ",1
"Thanks to the excellent service of Kimmy gosh i hope i spelled that right! and the several return trips i've made here since my last review I'm gonna go ahead and dish out 5 stars nyeah yeah yeah n ""But Robert, the majority of your reviews are tending towards the 5 star rating! "" n ""well detractor, I just happen to frequent kick ass places, so f ck you next question! """,2
"Go to the Encore Spa, it's just a short walk, the prices are teh same and it is infinitely better. I had an 80 minute massage and not only did my massage therapist do nothing more than apply lotion for the whole time, the transactional part of this is very obtrusive, the staff are not helpful and I have had infinitely better experiences elsewhere, do not waste your money.",1
"The only thing good about this place is being here in the summer outside on the patio before all the cheeseheads come out. The staff stinks and the prices are outgrageous and it is just silly. NEVER pay to get in here if you must go, get in before they start charging cover or just refuse to pay and if you are a chick they will usually let you in for free. Bleh!",1
My family I went to Maggiano's to celebrate my daughter's nephew's 13th birthday. It was crowded but we were seated within 10 minutes. Our server was very prompt and informative. I ordered a bottle of Chianti and the price was very reasonable. I had the Shrimp and Crab Cannoli and it was soo delicious. Everything we ordered was great we will definitely be back!,2
"I ordered two chicken Mediterranean sandwiches to go. Made with roasted chicken breast, feta cheese, lettuce. Service was great, food was yummy. The sesame bread was terrific! My only complaint was it took them close to half an hour to make the food. It did not seem to be that busy when I placed my lunch order. Would love to go back.",2
"This place is nothing more than a haircut factory. This was my first last time here. It appeared that me coming in was more of an interruption to a card game between employees. It was also apparent that the stylist cutting my hair was in a hurry to get back to the game. Though for 15 it was nice to get a straight razor shave, I noticed the cut was pretty sloppy after I left.",1
"I love it here. Great place to go if you want to be fancy. Not the finest food in the world, but the view is unique to Vegas. The service is great, it should be, it's pricey enough for the okay food. Still gets 4 stars though. It's a great experience. Ride the rollercoaster at the top of the casino afterwards!",2
Is this place 5 star? No but it is a solid 4 given it's location. Say what you want but I've had much worse than this and they are located in much better situation. If you get the to go boxes that they have then plan on lower quality. You have to get it made fresh or don't bother. I've had the to go boxes as well and they are ok if you get them early.,2
"I went here for lunch with Rand H. and the choices were large roughly 100 and with everything being good to great. I did not have anything I did not like. A couple of things that stood out were the onion rings,baked salmon,Japanese carrot slices witch are yellow and sweet nothing at all like a carrot.The lunch i had was good and I would go back to this place. Yay I am a fan. ni",2
"Places that will not give me a glass of water when I am eating there are so lame. If I am a paying customer you shouldn't require me to order a bottle of water as well. Food was okay. I frequent Vegas about 5 7 times a year, and sometimes stay at the PH. But won't ever be eating here again on principle. Provide your paying customers with water people, really.",1
"Killer, killer, killer food! I have never eaten here and left without thinking, ""wow, that was good! "" Not only is the the food exceptional, but the staff and drinks are equally as good. I run my own restaurant in the 18b, and can't wait to hang out here! Do yourself a favor and eat, drink, and feel sexy at Mingo's! Btw there is an actual Mingo and he is beyond cool. Love this place!",2
"Great place to get a pedicure and gel manicure! Service is always good. Chairs are so very comfy! I would recommend making an appointment though because walk ins are usually impossible. ""Can you come back in 2 hours? "" It usually costs around 70 tip to get a pedicure and gel manicure. Pricey, but I like that the service and cleanliness is consistent!",2
"Been going here for about 6 months now and was not real excited at first but the food kept getting better. Try the brisket plate or pork sandwich, am sure you will be pleased! Also they have ""Prime Rib Fridays "" and its very good as well! Also they have a LARGE room in back for groups or extra people and a big screen TV for games and such!",2
I had Punjabi Saag and Shahi Paneer and both were delicious. I've eaten at Indian restaurants around the world and this is up there with the best that I've experienced. Staff very friendly and attentive. Right next door to an Indian grocery so I expected something really tasty and that's what we got.,2
"Food wasn't that great! Since I had ordered noodle soup, I asked for a little bit of bean sprout and they had to charge me 1 for just a tiny bit! How cheap and no customer service. And they don't carry soup spoons.big problems when this is an Asian restaurant.All the noodle soup place have soup spoons.tsk tsk tsk!",1
"Found this restaurant when ioda looking for a place to eat. Not as packed on a Friday evening as everywhere else, but the place was amazing. Great food, cool patio, cheap drinks, kind staff. Got great recommendations from or server on what to order and it didn't disappoint. Was able to catch a basketball game out on the patio bar as well. Great atmosphere, great people. Will definitely be back.",2
"I've been here before and received the same dismal and uninterested service both times. Sad. Our group was here for Sunday NFL breakfast and though the Bloody Mary bar looked tempting, no one imbibed. We went for the beer specials, which were good. The breakfast burrito was also tasty, but I seriously cannot get past your horrible horrible service.",1
"Our favorite little go to spot. My fianc u00e9 and I usually go to Upper Crust at least one to two times per week. We now have our ""own "" booth and the waitress know us well. In other words, we are always made to feel special there. We always get the Ceasar Salad and a large pizza with feta cheese on it.extra crispy please! We thank you, Upper Crust for your existence and to the great wait staff!",2
"When Chop Shop opened I would have given it 5 stars, but things have gone down hill in the past couple months. The juices are amazing I have no complaints there, the issue we are continuing to have is with lettuce in the salads. Chop Shop creates wonderful salads, but lately salads have had really brown and slimy lettuce to the point of having to throw away 4 salads. Not impressed!",1
We've been going to spring training for 8 years now and have never missed a night at Malee's during that time. The food is always fantastic and they do a mean gin and tonic. Its not a quite romantic setting but the atmosphere is lively and the staff are really friendly. Order anything on the menu and you wont be dissapointed. Only complaint is that there often isn't enough room left for more beer.,2
"This is one of my favorite places to shop. Great for craft supplies they have a huge selection but they have so much more. Tons of fabrics at good prices. If you are looking for decor for your home they have about a million different items, everything from children to sophisticated, definately a must visit",2
"Not a big fan. Place feels cramped to me and the seating is awkward. Staff was rude to myself and my friends. So many parents around, no room for the kiddos to run! My kiddo got hurt on the slide, and no one asked if he was ok?! The playstructure was pretty cool on the upside. We much prefer Tykes N Tots in the SW",1
"I eat a lot of asian food. When it comes to thai food, I base it on one main dish.pai thai. And their wasn't too great. It tasted like one you would get from a mall food court not from a nice sit down. And their beef was not very tender. I love to support local small businesses but sadly, I won't be returning to this one. Their customer service was excellent though",1
FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! Toyota advertises a free gift to bring you into their dealership. I drove all the way across town only to be told that they aren't offering the free gift. It was a sales ploy. DO NOT go to Centennial Toyota! On top of that he employee I spoke with was very rude and wasn't knowledgeable at all. If I could rate this dealership a 0 out of 5 stars I definitely would!,1
"I've lived near Jalisco for 2 years and LOVE Mexican food yet have never had the desire to try the restaurant because the sign is ugly and uninviting! My husband however knowing my love for Mexican food decide to take me there for a date! I've now been to Jalisco twice and have been sooo impressed with the environment, service and food! I have greatly enjoyed my experiences!",2
"Denny's is hit and miss. Growing up I had a wonderful local Denny's that served piping hot delicious food every time. Unfortunately, our first visit here will be our last. All 3 dishes served at my table were cold and the wait was excessive. The waitress was very upbeat, friendly and put her best effort forth. However, cold food is unacceptable!",1
Came with the full family after a play at the centaur. Service was. over zealous nThey forgot 3 of the 10 items we ordered nThe salad had no dressing nMy club sandwich came 10 min after the rest of the food got to the table and was made with bread ends heels. I could go on but. nThere are great Montreal restaurants but this is not one of them. Do not waste your time or money.,1
"If you are coming to watch ""the game "", skip it. They have a few small tvs, but instead of having the sound on, they play a radio station. I went yesterday and it was a ghost town. The waitress was actually sitting at the bar eating bread and it appeared drinking a pint. After a while it was only us remaining. It was so quiet I almost forgot the game was on.",1
"I have only encountered one QuikTrip I wasn't happy with, and it wasn't this one. It's on my way to work, so I will occasionally stop in for gas if it's cheap , a coffee, or some other drink. Mornings are quite busy, but their system gets the customer out pretty quickly.hence the name QuickTrip? Heh.",2
"You sort of have to come here with an open mind and a willingness to spend some money they're a little pricey . The Smash sandwich is weird but good. Loved the roasted sweet potatoes and beets and the chocolate AND the raisin cookies. The service was good and the decor was modern. Cool that like Carhops, it's not far from where I work now.",2
"L O V E this place! Best ever and enjoyed every bite yummy! I went with the pecan turtle, it was just for me so I went with the one scoop version. This yummy treat was worth it! Everyone was very nice and helpful. Of course I had to sample plenty but was able to find the one for me. Make sure to stop by because it's worth it!",2
"I can't miss a week without the massaman curry and thai iced tea from this underappreciated gem. nThe prices are shockingly low for the quality and quantity of amazing thai cuisine you're in store for. Not to mention the warm family that runs this mesa favorite, everytime I come in they make me feel like a member of the family. nCareful ordering ""thai spicy "" its not for the uninitiated. nEnjoy!",2
I get my hair cut at these types of places and i rotate all the time. There is a guy here mildly creepy and blatently prompting you for gossip. I'm sure he and so many other stylists get a ton of it but i could tell he was prompting me for it. No thanks. When i want to put people on blast i'll do it myself.,1
"Been going there for years. If you can find someone else I say go there, horrible office staff no one gets back to you on tests results. Will hope to find someone new in 2012. Waiting time is terrible usually an hour and half no matter what time I get there. Looking for someone on the southwest Laura",1
"I love this vet! I have 5 animals and they take very good care of us. They are always flexible and very pleasant to deal with. Dr. Tamara is who my babies see, and they love her, as do I. I live less than 1 mile from a different practice, but I drive the 30 minutes into Charlotte to go to Commonwealth. I won't take my furry family members anywhere else.",2
"Very large menu, but poor service. Waiters have far too many tables at peak times leaving the guest unattended and forgotten about. We were just a party of 4 and it was not a good visit. Others around us had similar problems. There are far too many restaurants in Scottsdale area, avoid the headache and go elsewhere.",1
"I love this Great Clips. I always call ahead and make sure Annalisa is working. She does a really good job on my long, thick hair. First time I came in, I knew I just wanted something new. Some more volume, some more texture. She gave me great layers and a style that's easy going. So lucky I found her. I've been seeing her for a couple years now. Everyone else there seems pretty cool, too.",2
"So over priced, and this was the worst steak i have ever had in my life. I would have been happier at Outback. Service was good but the food was a huge letdown. I just moved here and i have had steaks from Ruth Criss, Hyde Park, Gibsons the best I have ever had and Mortons. When i told the waiter about the steak nothing was done.Will never go tothis place again.Horrible, Horrible, Horrible",1
I kind of wondered how long it would take for Al's Beef to close up shop after Portillo's arrived in town. Al's closed down a week or so ago. Their beef sandwiches as of the last few months were not as tasty as I remembered when the new ownership took over. I guess the Al's Beef experiment is over in Scottsdale.,1
"Wow! This place was recommended to us by a bartender as we were closing out the bar and it was spot on! It's a bit of a whole but no worse than some of the indi paki taxi spots back in NYC. Food for the price was incredible! Very fresh, very tasty! Might be our regular go to for late night eats while we are here in Montreal!",2
Visiting from California and had a craving for some soul food. Yelped my options and decided on this one. Best choice ever! Service was impeccable and everything I mean everything was just delectable. Not overly greasy or heavy but still packed with loads of flavor. This place will be an absolute go to every time I come to Vegas. Shout out to Q our server. ,2
"The corporation as a whole is a joke, they don't even care about their loyalty customer,s, bad rooms, horrible prices, this hotel is definitely a dinosaur in the industry. I won't be investing this company anytime. CEO should make a surprise visit just for sake of quality control. The last visit I will make to any M Life Hotel!",1
"What an awesome place this is. My kid loves the fish tanks. There is so much to see and do here. Even if you're not the outdoorsy type, it's a cool place to be. On the weekend, the Boy Scouts of America usually cook sell food for charity out in front BPS . Try one of their fried Snickers bars, or a fried Twinkie.",2
"After seeing this on The Food Network, I was super excited to try it. It was not great! nI had the Mahi Mahi tacos both BBQ and blackened. Too much seasoning and salty. The crab and shrimp dip appetizers were ok, they tasted like a sour cream and onion potato chip. Service was awesome! But I will not be back ",1
"This place ok. For one their very greedy with their portions of meat and guacamole . The sweet pork salad is over priced 8.25 for the meat, beans and rice they put in it. The only good thing was the homemade flour tortilla. The staff was friendly but I think understaffed. The place is cute. Don't think I'll be back. Costa Vida is 10x better.",1
"Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco have a tie for the best pizza in town and best caprese in town. Less wait times and more seating at Cibo though, better parking too! Very attentive service and the owners are always around to greet you. Save some room for dessert Nutella Cr u00eape with fresh strawberries and chocolate drizzle is a maz ing!",2
"We had the seafood tom yum ramen and it was quite decent. My only issue with it is that they don't give you a lot of veggies. Just some mushroom and a touch of cilantro. For me, I love having a lot of veggies. You can order veggies on the side at an extra cost but I figured they might give you a small plate. Anyways, I will probably come back.",2
"Like many others, I don't get the concept of the Hawaiian Marketplace. The last thing it is is Hawaiian. It's a mish mosh of shops, kiosks and restaurants that don't really belong together. It looks promising from afar like a mirage. Then you get there and it's a pretty big disappointment. Next time, don't cross the street, don't stop, don't bother.",1
"We bought the Sea Bass. Before I bought it, I asked it if was fresh. ""Yes, it came in yesterday, but I don't know when it was fished. "" This was the fishiest tasting fish . . . just NASTY. BAD. Do not buy fish from this place. I will never shop here again. Period. Later edit Ok, some months later I shopped here again. We like the selection and open feel, but we avoid the fish. ",1
"So I have to admit I love bagels for breakfast, lunch or dinner! I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience here! Great sun dried tomato with salsa cream cheese. Beats any other bagel joint in the city. atleast the other ones I've been to they have a lot to choose from even a delicious, gigantic breakfast burrito.",2
"2 HOURS FOR AN OIL CHANGE?! nI bought my Yukon Denali from this dealer a year ago and absolutely love it. Made an appointment for an oil change, assuming I would be able to get in and out fairly quickly rather than just dropping in. Boy was I ever surprised. 2 HOURS LATER THEY WERE FINALLY DONE. I DOUBT I'LL RETURN HERE FOR SERVICE OR FOR MY 2015 YUKON DENALI",1
"Service here is so good. Restaurant is clean, modern, and has comfortable lighting. nFood we tried, Duck curry, really good. nSeafood delight was good but not my fav. too many octopus legs for my taste. The Papaya salad here is delicious. spicy coconut soup was the best. Yellow Curry here is pretty thick and had an msg after taste. But it was still good. Id definately come back.",2
Food was bleh. Small salad and my pork was much to be desired. Dessert was good but you can't go wrong with chocolate cake. Hostess was snippy and we sat all the way upstairs next to the waiters door very distracting. This was a miss for sure. Perhaps they changed the chef? Wouldn't recommend oh but parking was free that was nice of them.,1
"I have such a big sweet tooth so I was glad this was downstairs from my hotel room. The display of this establishment is beautiful! There are intricately decorated cakes and chocolates everywhere. They have a broad selection of pastries, gelato and crepes. I most recently tried their Apple Sensation crepe with Creme Brulee ice cream and it is to die for.",2
Wow great place! I received a coupon and though why not give it a try. Normally I go to great clips because I'm cheap but let me tell you this is way worth the extra 7 I had a great hair cut shampoo hot towel and massage. Ofelia was amazing and very informative and friendly. I think I will be back for sure!,2
"The people were great and the service very good considering they've only been open 2 weeks. Nice beer selection but disappointed that they have NO local beera, we've got excellent local brews they should make room on one of the many taps for local beer. The food was ok, the seafood mac cheese was very salty, kind of disappoimtimg.",1
"I will never patronize this establishment again I was there this past week end terrible service waited 40 minutes to get a drink then because I ordered top shelf liquor I was charged a sir charge of 2,50 for something called a prep fee the most ass A nine thing I ever heard of a charge which the bar couldn't even explain price gouging in short a scam I suggest you Run in the other direction",1
"Moi je fais partie de celle qui n'aime pas Como, . Mon argument principale est .trop.Trop gras, trop de sel, trop de fromage, trop cher, trop de bruit, le service trop mauvais, mauvais langage, mauvaise humeur g u00e9n u00e9rali u00e9. je suis aller souvent et j'y vais encore seulement quand j'ai pas le choix. Le stationnement est toujours plein? Il y a une raison?",1
"Very good authentic Mexican food, the corn tortillas are made in house. I usually always go for the trio of tacos, can't resist. They have a good selection of tap beer, local brews included. The atmosphere is trendy generally hosts a younger 30 40 crowd. nThe food was great, I will be dining here again.",2
At the place right now. 20 minutes and no one has even come to our table. No water. Nothing. I'm a waitress and this is by far THE WORST SERVICE EVER! They obviously don't care about customer service what so ever. No one has acknowledged how awful the service has been. Food was room temperature. Super angry. Fail! Oh and of course it's super expensive. I hate it so much.,1
"I've been hearing good things about this coffee house in Cave Creek so when Big Pete Pearson was playing there I decided to go. The show was excellent and Big Pete Pearson is wonderful person the service was attentive, and the food was good. Comfortable place to just hang out with your date. It would be nice to see more of the outdoor entertainment like this.",2
Worst service ever! A 15 minute wait turned into 40 minutes and when we walked in there were open tables all over. Then we waited 7 minutes before anyone talked to us. And it was freezing. And the staff was disorganized and slow. Just awful! A horrible example of what the Mandalay Bay service standard is!,1
"This 5 star rating is mostly for their boba! They are cool about how many flavors I put into my boba usually about 4! unlike other boba shops that only allow like 2 Their ramen is pretty good and decently priced. However, I don't like coming to this place much ONLY because I don't like coming out smelling like an Asian restaurant.",2
"Who doesn't want to see their food flying in the air?! This is the second time I've been to this Benihana at the Hilton and I have no complaints. My coworkers and I went after our trade show and they were very accommodating for us. We had 27 people! Anywho, my chicken was delicious especially with the dipping sauce. I couldn't have been a happier camper. It also helped I had my tall Sapporo.",2
"Brutal. Why do I keep giving this place ""one more chance "". It used to be great and after their recent problems, things have obviously changed. But if you are going to keep your doors open, have some pride! Maybe the owner should be down here setting the example for his employees.I hate to say the worst car wash ever.but no more chances from me.",1
"Well me and my friend from work tried this place out, and others we talked to gave rave reviews. Both of us though walked away and were not impressed with the food at all. The only thing that we both liked were the sweet potatoes. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and it was very salty then after a few bites was very very soggy and gelatinous. I will not be coming back.",1
"They have a really good salad. It is in a strip mall which I guess is common practice in Madison but I really don't care. I just want good food and their salad is good. The dressing is nice and light. What a refreshing change in Madisoot to have a salad with some heavy ranch, french or thousand island dressing.",2
"I own a house in Vegas. Had problems with my dishwasher and air conditioning. Called Proserv they came, fixed everything, were very professional. They also checked my dryer and fixed it, even though the dryer was not part of the call I had made and had just broken that day. They truly saved the day! Highly recommend Proserv!",2
"This was a really cute and cozy tasting room that was really hard to find! I was determined, though, to find it because of the Yelp check in offer. They had a nice wine selection, the guy working there wasn't pushy, and I enjoyed a quiet hour sipping on wine. I hope this place stays in business because it is a relaxing spot to enjoy wine.",2
"Sat on the patio for a brunch with a friend. It has a great view of the strip. nit was slightly hot, but they had ceiling fans and it was slightly breezy anyways. nWe ordered french onion soup, which was really sweet. nTheir quiche and chicken salad baguette was good. nService was just so so. We constantly found our glass empty. nWe had to look around to search for our server. ",2
" 10 entrance during Memorial Day weekend! Our group of 10 girls and guys were not about to pay 100 to get into a fancy club with no places to sit, so we decided to go to Carnaval instead. It's an outdoor club bar with plenty of tables and chairs and a big dancefloor. I love that it was a casual place, so our boyfriends didn't have any trouble getting in with a hat on or sneakers.",2
ZERO STARS! I can't express how horrible their service is. There is a cashier who has been working at frys forever and her service is in the toilet I can't believe she still has a job there. DONT SHOP HERE! I was made embarrassed about my form of payment today and this was the straw off the camel's back. I have never been treated so badly in my life. Will never shop here again!,1
"Jahrelang unser liebster und einziger B u00e4cker, doch seit geraumer Zeit riechen Backwaren immerwieder entweder nach Handcreme oder nach Rasierwasser. Bitte benutzt doch Handschuhe sowie die Konkurrenz das macht. Bis dann werden wir wohl oder u00fcbel voanders Brot kaufen, obwohl es dort nicht so gut schmeckt, aber es riecht nicht nach Aftershave oder Nivea.",1
"Had a wonderful evening last night here . The Spazmatics played on the showroom and a good time was had by all! It's a medium size showroom, very comfy booths and not smokey at all. The waitress came and and checked at just the right time for drinks the entire time the band played. The valet was quick and polite! Great way to spend a Sunday evening!",2
Have Terminix Termite and Pest Control. nNoticed a problem with termites and called. No one answered phone went to voice mail. No call back. nCalled next day and operator just took message. Said could not schedule an appointment. nCalled again on third day and was told that someone would get back to me withing another 72 hours. nThis is now 4th day and no call back. No appointment. NO SERVICE.,1
"Walls are paper thin. Will never stay here again. You can hear people in hallway and their conversations, and people in the next room. It sounded like a pig was being slaughtered. At 1 30 am. No rest. Rooms very cold like a walk in refrigerator. Thermostat didn't work. Finally turned off fan and a c. Still super cold.",1
"Online Order would not work. nCalled in Order. nNew Employee, gave order 3X nArrived Wrong! Pizza under done, No side of marianara as ordered. Why bother Order from a cpizza hain if they cant do anything right? nRuined the whole reason for ordering a pie nFor 30 bucks I can grill steaks That is what I will do in the future nPapa Johns SUCKS!",1
"Jamburritos is by and far my favorite food truck. The chicken jamburrito is amazing, their hush puppies are perfectly spiced, and their homemade lemonade is tart and refreshing. The guys running the truck are unfailingly nice, which makes the experience even better. It's absolutely worth your time to visit them at the biweekly Phoenix Public Markets or wherever else they might be that day.",2
"I love this place! Maybe it was the day I went on. It's comparable to the Rio buffet. They have many selections and it's always filled. I love it! You definitely get the most bang for your buck! To sum it up cheaper, lots of variety, lots of types of ethnic foods, lots of desserts, always filled. If you plan on eating dinner, come a little earlier to avoid the lines.",2
"Filthy dirty restaurant. I sat at the bar for a quick lunch and as I pulled out the bar stool, four dead dead for a while crickets were next to my chair. Old cereal, cracker crumbs, etc. were all over the floor and had been there for some time. Yuck! I mentioned something to the server. She said, ""oh, sorry. "" Never attempted to clean it up.",1
"I ordered online at 9 20 pm on Wednesday night 9 21 2011. An hour and a half later with no pizza I called to see how much longer it would be. The employee informed me ""any minute now "" the delivery guy already left. At midnight over 2 1 2 hours later I called them back upset to cancel my order. The employee was rude and short and gave no explanation or apology. Seriously?",1
Worst Sprint store in town. Their staff are theives and the managers cover up for them. I'm currently disputing fraudulent charges from this store. No one wants to take responsibility and I'm out 500 Horrible customer service and untrained staff. I proved one of their sales people stole from me and threw manager did nothing! I'm also reporting this store to the BBB. DO NOT GO HERE!,1
"I agree completely with the previous reviewer. This place is not too far to drive and service is always quite fast. I went to a different place today but was unable to find where they advertised it to be. Then, I knew I should have just done what I've done for a few years. I headed to Fort Apache, drove right in, and was on my way in about 5 minutes. The registration process is done.",2
"Fun selection of toys and trendy accessories coats, , collars, Sleepypods, leashes, etc. The staff was fairly friendly, albeit a bit too busy to help me as I was the only one there sans dog at that exact moment. I'd come back for sure as they have some items that I've only seen in the US, but this wouldn't be my first destination for dog food.",2
"Went here for a real late night meal around 3am, it wasn't that crowded but I guess they didn't have all the tables open so I waited for about 15 mins and finally got seated. Service was kinda slow and food was mediocre we ordered the quesadillas, spicy chicken sandwich and a burger. All just average. I can't complain too much since the meal was free, but probably would not come if I had to pay.",1
"I wasn't expecting much with a buffet, but food that makes me puke can't be good. I had orange chicken soggy , spanish rice, fried rice, and some alfredo noodles. The noodles were delicous but I still ended up having to run to the restroom and puke, which is a definite warning sign. I didn't eat here again after that and probably won't. If you insist on a buffet try the one at the Excalibur maybe?",1
"The salsa is chunky and delicious! I got fajitas, they were decent and my wife got enchiladas, she got one with green salsa and one with red salsa, she liked the red salsa the best. I didn't have any problems with my refills, the waitress was nice and efficient. We finished our meal with fried ice cream and we all enjoyed it. I would recommend this place.",2
"This was on our ladies night out list for my bachelorette party last month. We hit a few spots before nestling at Moon Ghostbar as they are uber close to each other. I recommend. Good vibe, gorgeous crowd, decent bartenders and a view that would make anyone feel like Paris Hilton. The bouncers could use a lollipop to cheer them up though. They all seemed a little grumpy!",2
"You can't go wrong using these guys! They fix all you electrical and Data problems. They work on huge projects but they still care about the little ones too! Don't feel like your wasting their time for such a small job. They will be there on time and will have the solution your looking for! I highly recommend this company, and after you use them you'll see why!",2
"Employees at the cafe are horrible! I work nearby, and would probably frequent this place five days a week if it weren't for the awful customer service. No smiles, no ""have a nice day, "" multiple messed up orders, attempts at small talk rebuffed, etc. I could go on and on. I've given up on this place. Good thing other Starbucks are easy to find!",1
"This place is great for guys. Tones of TV's with multiple sports on. They have beer pong tables and sell a beer pong pack with cups and balls for 5. Happy hour was between 3pm 6pm. Really cheap beer. The waitresses were friendly, helpful and very talkative. The barman was also a really nice guy. Great for groups.",2
"Had a last minute delivery before they closed. Took about 45 minutes and we had our dinner at our door. The ribs were so tender that the meat fell off the bone. Cowboy beans and coleslaw are top notch. Coleslaw is unique, not sure what the secret ingredient is, but it sure works. Will call again for delivery, much better than having a pizza delivered.",2
"Had a great meal here on 11 14 2010 nThe experience, while good, did not match our many visits to both the Paris restaurants, especially in the dessert department. The service was warm and professional . The surcharge on the soup course was unexpected considering that I had clearly informed them while choosing my tasting menu that I was not choosing that option. I would still go back again!",2
This place is a huge ripoff! They charge you an arm and a leg for the simplest things and forget about a big repair that'll cost you your first born and then some. For the prices offered I would at least expect exemplary customer service but that was mediocre at best. If your looking to get anything done to your car I would highly recommend you look elsewhere.,1
"Amazing service, even with it being my server's final day. With the fact it was the 7pm on the Friday before Christmas, my order came out rather quickly. Loved the tall glass of beer, but the dinner portions for the Korean Chicken Kona Ribs could have been a bit bigger for the price. Loved the Apple Blueberry Walnut Cobbler.!",2
"Overpriced. Their most basic pedicure is 17. Everything else is 30 . A full set for 30? No! Seriously, go somewhere else for a full set and come here for a fill. At least those are competitively priced at around 20. Don't get me wrong, my nails turned out gorgeous, but I could have gone else where and gotten the same friendly service and a full set and fabulous pedicure for 45.not 70.",1
"Wow, I can't stop going to this place! I have to get on here and comment on a couple of new menu items I've tried. Recently tried the Adobada and the Carnitas burritos both were fantastic. Pork and guacamole is always a great combo. And the Steak and Chorizo Burrito is the stuff of legends. No joke this thing is amazing! It's pretty much all meat with a red chile type sauce.",2
"Last Monday I went to a register where the lady laughed and mentioned she was sick with an ear infection was joking and said should I take a shower every customer and said she wasn't going to sanitize. I understand we all need to work but please do sanitize I have 4 children it's a domino effect once 1 gets sick. I do know her name, hopefully you can talk to the employees about this! Thank you.",1
I've been to this location a few times while getting gas and shopping at Albertson's or other stores in the area. My Caramel Macchiato decaf. with soy has always been tasty so I assume it's been prepared correctly. I've never had to wait more than two people. There are table and chairs inside and out.,2
"I honestly love the Korean Mexican fusion food. The person who put Korean BBQ in a taco is a genius. That being said, I ordered the bulgogi tacos and the chicken wings. Both were delicious! I wish I could've tried more food, but I wasn't super hungry. The table next to me ordered the tostadas and kim chi fried rice. Gotta get that next time because they looked bomb diggity!",2
"I was so worried this morning when the AC went out and the forecast called for Sunny, Sunny, Sunny! I chose Number 1 based off their Yelp reviews. They were prompt, thorough and affordable. I spoke with Steve on the phone and was serviced by Leon. My AC is working again and it's only 8 15am! I have their card on the fridge and will be using them again.",2
"I had my first date here a small all dressed. I live in the states, and whenever I'm home, its my first stop. It was the post dance, gossip girls, central meet ery, mom doesn't want to cook, will deliver fast, I LOVE THIS PLACE. It sets the all dressed pizza standard. The poutine is scary good and so worth all the calories.",2
"I'm so happy I checked the hot new businesses in my neighborhood today on my yelp app! I hit the German chocolate cupcake jackpot today, moist and delicious tastes like Christmas at grandma's house! The decor is so cute very country makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside . I will be back soon to try the tres leches and red velvet!",2
"Went to Vegas for my 21st and had an absolute blast because I got in to everywhere with my friend group guys included for free! Many thanks to Chris for working so hard when my last minute changes came up, I definitely recommend going through Free Vegas Club Passes if you want to have a good time in Vegas!",2
"CRAPTASTIC. Apparently, one word reviews are FROWNED UPON in this institution, so let me elaborate. DISCLOSURE The reviews seemed evenly split between likers and haters, so I came in with an open mind. I hereby officially declare myself a HATER. Sugar filled pizza sauce. Underdone and very bland crust. I could go on.but I have better things to do. Slow service never helps either.",1
"This location is a bit hidden in an odd shaped shopping center in the old part of Queen Creek near Norton's Corner and Eggs TC . I was very pleasantly surprised with how spotlessly clean the restaurant is inside, including really clean restrooms. Service is friendly and fast. Food is excellent they have a very nice salsa bar, too . Prices are very low. Lots of very good seating inside.",2
"I've been exploring my new neighborhood and found this gem. We started off with the lettuce wraps gf is vegetarian so went with tofu and they were awesome. After apps, moved onto and really enjoyed the surf and turf specialty roll. The restaurant has a great atmosphere for any date night or casual dining experience. Looking forward to visit again!",2
Medical assistance in a Bakery? Great bakery service. I've come here for meetings in the morning about 20 times. Staff are friendly and you never feel rushed out even when you didn't order anything. I was with a friend that had some medical problems and ended up on the ground. Staff came around more than once to help out and to see what else they could do. Food has always been good and consistent.,2
Well.my fiance put it best as we were walking out. It was like a very expensive freak show. I love Cirque's and really liked the idea of one that would push the envelope a little. But for the money.it really falls flat. We made the mistake of going to Le Reve first.and that was so unbelievably amazing.that it probably soured us a little here.,1
I went for a symposium here last weekend and I have to say that the campus is pretty snazzy. I go to grad school at CSUN and our campus is like a homeless person asleep in an alley way. Not so with UNLV! The place was really nice with allot of modern facilities. nThe anthropology faculty and staff were incredibly knowledgeable and were really involved with outreach efforts.,2
"This was my second visit, the first being worthy of a second. Sadly, perhaps they changed chefs or it was a bad night as everything was sooo tasteless and yet extremely salty. Our bus boy must have been jilted by someone as he scowled and slammed dishes about. The waiter was mostly absentee. I don't think I'll be going back for thirds.",1
"Went here after i got married. We had 19 in our party and the servers were wonderful. All of us were really impressed. We even had a private room. Its a little expensive, but worth the extra dollars. My steak w mashed potatoes and roasted veggies was around 30. The atmosphere is nice, its very laid back. Thank god for the private room, we were able to stash away my very loud family of comedians!",2
"Decor is nice, service well intentioned actually Fernando was really sweet, but the restaurant was almost empty and the manager came over to hush our bachelorette dinner. the edamame was overcooked, but they replaced well. Our lemons drops came with SALTED rims, but they replaced them. Food was good but not memorable. Won't be back.",1
"The dim sum at phoenix palace is pretty good, we enjoyed everything. I ordered something new in my book and that was the curry tendon it was a bit chewy and was lacking the curry flavor but overall not bad. My favorite part about dining here is when you sit down and all the ladies with their dim sum carts flock toward you!",2
"The staff were SO welcoming and so friendly. I love that it is a family owned business too. Although I only ate one roll, it was delicious. I went with my family, and they said all of the sushi they got was really good, as well. Oh! They have happy hour from 5 7 which was why I originally wanted to go check it out. Overall, it was a great first experience!",2
So I don't think I've ever had brussel sprouts before but someone at our table ordered them as an appetizer and they were extremely tasty. You really need to try them. Im not a big fish guy but I ordered the Blackened Cod and it was some of the tastiest fish I have ever had. I also had the Filet Mignon and it did not disappoint. Sushi wasn't bad but paled in comparison to everything else.,2
"The parking is not that easy here, even if you arrived early. I think that we ended up in someone's backyard lot. It's not that close to the freeways. But, catching the W.Sox v. Cubs game here for Spring Training is awesome! However, don't get me wrong, it's not even a tenth as good as catching the rivalry in Wrigley which I've done too , but close.",1
"Not a Sweet Tomatoes that's for sure. The selections are scarce and when you are use to all they have to offer at the Sweet Tomatoes, you are definitely disappointed when you see what they have to offer at this Souper Salad. In a pinch it would work, but you can definitely find something else better.",1
"Made a reservation for a party of 8 and on our way to the restaurant, I received a call from the location on scottsdale road confirming our reservation. I explained that i was certain that i called the Biltmore location. Once i arrived the Biltmore, they did not have a reservation and did nothing to accomodate our frustrated party of 8. Won't be going back anytime soon.",1
"DO NOT COME HERE. IT'S A SCAM. There are so many better gelato places with more reasonable prices. There's Trevi right in the middle of the Forum Shops, there's Payard right in Ceasar's as well near the Palace Tower, Cafe Gelato next door at Bellagio, and Cocolini, a short walk away at Venetian and Palazzo. SAVE YOUR MONEY!",1
"Love this sandwhich place! The bread is fresh and so are the deli and the veggies. I usually order the turkey special, which for 7 comes with a drink and a choice of side, chips or potatoe salad, or maccaroni salad. I usually just get the chips, because the other stuff were too small. But all still a great deal! Staff is great always service with a smile. This is on my top lunch list! ",2
"The food here was greasy, uninspired and bland. The mockmeat ""chicken "" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy. It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites. I was also disappointed that they don't serve brown rice. The service was friendly enough, though. Not to be recommended unless you're desperate.",1
"Myself and Emma here again on this cold Sunday evening. Zen always serves up great food, reasonable prices and the friendliness of the staff certainly cancels out the cold weather. Consistently for years now the management and staff are great. Mix of Asian and Spanish plus the sushi Salmon Nigiri is great !",2
"Pure is OK not too great compared to other clubs in LV these days. The line was RIDICK even with the VIP list and all that. It was too freakin hot in there and the only bathroom was on the top floor no bueno. I shortly left after being admitted for free. I did enjoy the hip hop room and the nice man who let us sit at tables until they were reserved. But, Ill stick to XS next time thanks",1
"Why put in a location downtown location and refuse to accomodate the business lunch crowd? Food is fine but the customer service is lacking. Our party of 7 was reminded ""no separate checks "". So, on the back of a napkin we do our math. Restaurant barely 1 2 full, but it's too much to split a check. Service abismal.",1
"Was just here, picked up a fresh juice. It was tasty. The cashier couldn't have been more unfriendly, totally flat and unwelcoming. I've been in the service industry for 8 yrs even if you are having a bad day, you still have to suck it up, put a smile on your face and be nice to customers! So juice gets five stars, service gets two stars.",1
I would really love to give this place a review but unfortunately I was not able to. Most of the time this would be no big deal. However they only had two people getting pedicures and she told me to come back 2.5 hours later to get a service when on the front door it very clearly states that walk ins are welcome and accepted.,1
"Amazing service and food. Love the entrance with fresh herbs growing and open air kitchen with vibrant colors. Servers are friendly and patio space is amazing. Love the seasonal menu with healthy foods. Lots of gluten free, dairy free options. Did I mention the attention to seasonal cooking is amazing. Love Love Love!",2
"I have given this Walmart numerous chances and every visit has been the same or worse. nRude employees with the worst attitude I have encountered at a Walmart. nDirty store, with open packages of food on the shelves. Like customers just come in and eat in the isles. So, 3 strikes this Walmart is out!",1
"The king suite has large old couch that is fading in color. They could afford the other furniture to replace but kept an old couch. See pic. Also, bathroom light is low where anyone can walk in and see you using it. Thank god, I have no guests. Venetian should be a 3 star hotel. Dropped to one star for our stay there.",1
I have been taking my poodle terrier mix to Shelly's for a very long my 10 year old dog is not the easiest to handle but the do so well with her. She comes out looking and smelling great. Shelly's takes her on time and their estimated time to get her out are pretty well on target. I have used several different groomers in the shop and each has done well. I recommend you give Shelly's a try!,2
"I found this place through Yelp and I'm glad I did. It's on the small side and it's super busy but service is quick and the food is good. They really have a variety of things to order from breakfast stuff to quesadillas, to burgers and pitas. For me I gotta have the jalapeno burger which is always cooked perfect. It's hard to find a place that doesn't over cook their burger meat.",2
This is a gem of a shop in Phoenix. I recommend stoping by and seeing this awesome shop that offers cool items with great customer service. This is a must see for a locals or a tourist of Phoenix. This is only 15 minutes from the airport and centrally located no matter what direction you are heading.,2
"I have been here several times in the, dare I say, several weeks, too hot to cook. The food has always been very good and served in a decent time. The first time I came in service was slow, but I have not seen that waiter since and have had no problems since. I will continue going there, highly recommend it to anyone.",2
"Absolutely the best meal we had while staying on Fremont Street! Everything from the bread to the main courses were expertly prepared and served by our awesome waiter Andrew! Steaks were rare as ordered, tender and delicious and my spicy pasta with scallops and shrimp was absolutely amazing! Thanks from your Oregon friends!",2
"Stopped in as all the cars in the drive through had me believing that good food was to be had. Wrong! nBurger sucked, had the 1, burnt to a crisp, should have taken it back but I just won't frequent this place ever again. nMaybe everyone was in line for the custard, I can't believe anyone likes their burgers.",1
"Had the fish tacos and sea food chowder. Seemed a little expensive, but after seeing and tasting OMG more than enough food for two and so yummy. Definitely a unique experience and a great place to take your honey. I like the paintings on the wall showing the different types of fish they serve. We will go back for sure.",2
"Service was great, but the sushi was not. I'm a sushi fanatic and was very disappointed in the quality. The spicy tuna roll that came with my dinner plate was obviously sitting out for a while as the rice on the outside was dry and hard. The seaweed was also chewy. I'm sure the hibachi side is nice, but skip the sushi.",1
"First time here but I really like this place! It's very clean and the staff is very friendly. They're not very busy, I was able to get right in. She was very gentle with my feet. I usually get some pain from pedicures but she was great. Got both a manicure and a pedicure and they both look great! I'll be back!",2
So my wife and I went in to purchase window treatments for our house. We must have not had the air of South Park on us as we had salespeople walk by us with no one even asking if we needed anything even as we started to look through sample books and a clearly not doing anything sales lady walked by multiple times. My business will be taken elsewhere.,1
Awesome! Thatis the best way to describe it. We had several different things and each was great. Prices are add good as I have ever seen. The sashimi was the best my wife and I have ever had. A lot of food. Wait staff was helpful and explained the specials without getting irritated. If I lived in the area we would definitely be eating here regularly.,2
"Most mediocre sub I've ever eaten. Limited options for toppings. Much prefer subway where you can ask for whatever topping you like as you go through the line. I went back with my sandwich to ask if they had salt and pepper. ""No, sorry. "" I honestly thought she was kidding. Won't be back. How this got to be a major chain is beyond me.",1
The coffee is great but the service is TERRIBLE! Waited 25 minutes as 4th in line because the barista is chatting to his peeps and going slower than a slug in ice. The counter crew needs to lose the attitude and realize good service is what keeps customers. nThere are other great coffee shops like Lux and Drip in Phoenix. I will not go back to Cartel.,1
"Really enjoyed this quaint little wine bar. Ambiance and decor were great, however it was dark so difficult to read the menu. The Waitress helped me pick out a good glass of red wine, although she liked more rose wines. The bruschetta was AMAZING! We tried a variety of the bruschetta apple bri, artichoke and prosciutto. Can't wait to go back!",2
"Olive Garden, or The OG as the nimrods call it the food is a slap in the face to true Italians and foodies alike. There are far better places in Las Vegas for traditional Italian food, you have to look outside the box and a chain restaurant is hardly the place to find great food. Olive Garden is just the Italian Denny's. Try Roma Deli or Nora's Italian Cuisine for a true taste delight.",1
"More reasons for me to love Las Vegas! OH man, I can spend hours in this store, imagine spending hours and hours in TopShop NYC. I NEVER leave empty handed. NOT A GOOD THING! On top of this amazing store, is the amazing 10 student discount they give! I can't wait til they open TopShop in LA at the Grove. It's probably the worse idea ever.my wallet will HATE me!",2
"Owners are total asswipes. David Matthew McGovern . nThey overcharge on all their services cost of mailboxes. USPS, charges 64.00, semi annually. These guys charge nearly three times that amount. A total rip off. And it's a nightmare with them as far as forwarding your mail. It's NOT ALLOWED FROM A UPS STORE SUPRISE? nI would never trust these crooks!",1
"I took my daughter to Nailed and Lashed yesterday for her 13th birthday.with her 2 sisters and 3 friends. They and I all got mani pedi's. It was so relaxing, a beautiful atmosphere and the staff was very fun, friendly, and accomodating. The owner even stayed and helped to make it a special birthday experience for my daughter. It was so fun and we all loved it! Thank you Nailed and Lashed.",2
"Chose to spend the New Years with the family there. Not sure if this Hyatt is old or what but the place was dingy and not welcoming compared with other HyattPlace I have stayed. Food quality was to the floor. Old tasting. Chewy textures and lack of variety. I truly regret this stay. For a New Year's Eve, the staff was so not cheerful and the hotel did not offer any activity for the guests.",1
"By far the best coffee shop from Seattle to Kentucky. I've been here several times. I don't drink coffee anymore, however it was the best I've ever had. My husband and sister agree! They offer vegan food, almond, rice and soy milk. I just ordered the Iced Chai Latte with Rice Milk, amazing! Great little place right by the airport, I wish I could visit this place more often.",2
First of all my take on the food is it is Awesome! We have always liked the food. BUT the service really really really is very very very BAD. They left us at the table with glasses empty fo longer then they should have especially after having spicy mexican food. Also when it was time to get the check or pay they just completely disappeared. Service has steadly went down hill.,1
"So I usually play golf here about twice a month, and yes it's a good golf course. It's your typical country club course, difficult enough to make it slightly challenging for the amateurs, tough for the newbies, and easy enough for a good golfer to shoot near par. It's kept in pretty good shape, and they have a nice club house. Plenty of people to help you out when you're there too.",2
"This place was absolutely amazing! Out waiters name was Dave. He treated us so well. Answered all of our questions and gave us amazing recommendations. We ate the stuffed shells, spaghetti and meatballs, and lasagna and it was spectacular! The food came out so fast, and we were starving. I will definitely be back to this place very soon!",2
"this is the WORST casino chain in Las Vegas Henderson, first of all they send you free Louie Anderson tickets valid through 1 31 2013 and when we tried to use on 1 26 13, anderson was not only there but nobody was in the showroom at all, it was DARK, then we had there ! margaritas and there was zero tequila in them, the entire place is a MISREP and SCAM.",1
I just wanted to drop a quick note to let you know how happy my girlfriend was with her flowers. In the past year I have purchased flowers for her 4 times from other florist and although she is always happy to receive them something always seems to go wrong. You guys really came through and she was very pleased! I will be using you guys every time from here on out. Thank you!,2
"I had my bulldog neutered here because I heard that this place specializes in bulldogs. However the front desk staff is really rude, un courteous. It seems like they don't want to be there. There was only 1 person at the front desk that was actually approachable it was a young guy. I will never spend my money here on treatments again",1
"I have stayed at the Doubletree Greentree four or five times, and today I'm asking myself why I keep coming back here. The fact that I spend 150 nights per year in Hilton properties is lost on the staff at this hotel. The fact that I am Honors Diamond, means nothing to them. In the future, when I plan travel to Pittsburgh, I will stay elsewhere.",1
Nasty i like hot dogs but this was just awful I have been waiting forever to try this and was so disappointed it's over priced and I could go to tj for a better hot dog and there 1 something extra for grilled mushrooms were canned mushrooms and I couldn't even finish it but If ur hungry and here I did enjoy there chili cheese fries save ur self the seven dollars and walk away,1
"I had lunch at the Apiary was stuffed happily from it! The burgers sing for themselves. I wil be back to try the pulled pork version and the chicken. The Pistachio and peach cake was like a fairy tale in my mouth no every mouthful. I'm assured the Rocky road dessert was delicious too. Set in Newington, it's handy to get to by bus and there a couple of spaces for cars. Yeah ""I'll be Back """,2
My husband took me to dinner here tonight for my birthday and we thought the food was delicious. He ordered the chicken fajitas and I got the New York strip with yucca fries and black beans. The atmosphere is beautiful and the service was also great. Yes a little pricey but that's to be expected. And the dessert was also very delicious ! I would recommend eating here!,2
"I had a very bad experience. The food is of poor quality. The service is mediocre. I got the "" chili rellano omlette "" I was expecting fresh California or poballano chili's. It came with canned green chilis. The potatoes are cheap fried frozen potatoes , not fresh. Save your money there's much better breakfast places in town. .",1
"What a disappointment. The chips and salsa. The chips were rancid. Wow, just buy chips if you can't use good oil. We asked the wait staff if they could get us better chips since ours were rancid. The second basket were just less rancid. Really a simple thing to make well. I belched rancid all night. gross.",1
"I've already been to this place twice, and I enjoy the atmosphere. I was seated very quickly. Service was good though I did not know the chips and salsa and fries were addon items. I ordered the Pollo Asado, and was fairly large portion. Cooked to perfection, nothing tasted dry at all. Also the aioli salsa was great. 4 5 WCB",2
"The worst restraurant experience I have had in years. I was visiting from Chicago with friends. The service from the server and the manager were horrible. The food was not eatable. They could care less. Too bad Phoenix, I really liked the decor, the bar, and the people. Gay's, Straight's, and in between FYI. Bad news unless you are that desperate. No place like home, Sweet Home Chicago!",1
"I walked in and thought I had gone blind. it's dark in there! nOnce my eyes adjusted it was clear that the name Dive Bar is appropriate. There's a stage, pool table and a big bar with pretty comfortable bar stools. nThe drinks are cheap and everyone is friendly. This would be a great place to hang out and have a few drinks, play some pool and not care who's there or what you look like.",2
"well, I have never done business with these folks, but I did see someone driving down I17 in a gray Toyota pickup with big yellow TITLES R US signs throwing his trash out of the window. I suppose I would avoid doing that if I was representing my company that way. nWhen I need DMV service, I will avoid them.",1
"If I could give 0 stars I would. I called and the front desk lady was so rude to me, that there is no way I would trust their doctors opinion. If that's the kind of people they hire for customer service, then I don't want to give them any business. I can't imagine how poor they treat their patients.",1
"Wheelhouse lounge in Casino was very slow service. ""signature "" Fries are terrible, fresh fish sandwich good but oily, Italian sausage ok, wedding soup was tasty. Large screen sports bar is nice but drafty in the back. There is better food in the Casino, probably won't go here again. Forget this place, pay a little more and go to Andrews.",1
"I travel a lot for work and this hotel has the nicest staff of any hotel I've ever stayed in! Very thoughtful and respectful people working here. Dinners are complimentary to hotels guests Monday Thursday. All homemade, all delicious. Rooms are very clean and spacious. The beds were extremely comfortable and full of high quality pillows. I will definitely be staying here again!",2
"We went here for lunch on our trip to Vegas and really enjoyed the food and found it to be authentic and tasty. The host was friendly and it seemed like a nice family owned business. The naan was great, butter chicken and saag was good, rice was a bit hard as it was left steaming for a long time and the kheer could have been much better. All in all a very nice meal.",2
"This definitely is not authentic. but it's a fun, trendy place and the food is good. Hard Rock is always a fun atmosphere so Pink Taco fits right in there. I recommend the panuchos, or 1 taco and margarita happy hour. Can't go wrong with that! To go orders are really quick too. much appreciated on the way to work!",2
"I can't really write a very detailed description on this because we stayed only for 10 minutes. After walking in and finding that my husband and I were the youngest in there, by like 30 years, we had one round of nasty tasting drinks and left. On a plus, the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere not so much. We didn't get a chance to taste the food.",1
Good food and good atmosphere. I have been here over the years and never disappoints. Had a venison burger last night and was as good as the buffalo burger I had a year ago. I have suggested friends eat here and they too enjoyed it. In an alley off the main part of new and this only adds to the charm. Not touristy.,2
"YUM YUM. Was here on a LS deal twice! Tried the curried goat, ox tails and the meat pies. ALL were incredible. I grew up eating Jamaican cuisine, so the food is very familiar to me. I am seeking a Caribbean place that serves Black Cake, which is a great experience to taste. I make it myself, and it can be addictive.",2
"My friend and I visited this salon for the first time on a Saturday morning. We were greeted right away with a smile. The ladies who did our manis and pedis were sweet and engaged us in conversation. The hot stone massage for the pedi was such an awesome surprise! Overall, we were both very satisfied with our experience. Definitely recommend this salon to everyone!",2
"Very basic diner. Decent coffee and service, but otherwise disappointing. Instead of going with the inexpensive artery clogging traditional diner breakfast, I paid 8 for ""protein power pancakes "" which looked great but seemed to have vinegar in the batter. A very sour and unpleasant taste, so they were inedible. I complained but was still charged the full price. I won't be returning.",1
buyer beware! this is a new owner now and they have screwed my clients. they were paid in full and did not finish the job and are telling me that they have no more money to buy additional product until feb 2015 after they have done some additional jobs. do not use stonelikerefinishing it is a new owner,1
"This place is amazing! Like a one stop shop. You have the weight loss options which me and many of my friends have utilized but they also do all the extras. They have botox, the machine that reduces cellulite, and so much more. Last but not least they have the best meal replacement drinks and bars. Highly recommended!",2
Great prices. My daughter and I ate there for 12 and walked out stuffed. It's definitely not authentic Mexican but it is still good. I got the green chili chimichanga and a beef taco. Both were fantastic for the money. The only knock on the place I have is that it was 90 in the dining room so I just took my food to go.,2
"I am a huge fan! The rolls are a big and the fish is fresh.true to their motto of ""big and fresh "". I didn't give it 5 stars because the service was less than average. But the food and atmosphere are awesome. I am so glad that I gave this ""hole in the wall "" a chance. I've been there 3 times now and still love it!",2
The owner Brian is so moody. Once they came out I called with a minor complaint and he immediately said that no one ever complains and he was going to fire the crew. That's not cool. After that I never felt comfortable with his style and I stopped using them after a few months as we just didnt vibe.,1
"Horrible service! It took too long to get our drinks, napkins and utensils. Not to mention we couldn't get our waitress' attention and when she brought our napkins they were dirty. Not the cleanest of restaurants either. The food was ok, nothing special. Loved seeing what they had to offer in their menu but disappointed when it came out. The bacon was the best thing.",1
"Naja, wenn maicht weiss, dass man in einer gr u00f6 u00dferen Stadt ist, dann k u00f6nnte man meinen, dass das Kiwi auch ne Dorfdisco sein k u00f6nnte. Mir wars irgendwie zu kindisch da drin. Die Auswahl an Getr u00e4nken ist ok. Das Ambiente eher von vorgestern. Einen Raucherraum gibts auch noch. Alles in allem w u00fcrd ich nicht nochmal hingehen.",1
My family has been eating here for years. We dine in at one of the big tables and order family style or sometimes just call in for a pick up. Either way the staff is always friendly. They have a few items on the menu that I measure all other Chinese restaurants Stop in and order your favorite dish and see how they measure up.,2
omg WORST waste of money. I felt bad for our cousin who paid for all 6 of us to get in. If you want to just walk around reading about historic mob figures then it's fine. They tried to add a bit of acting to it but all in all you would have more fun going on one of the local roller coasters. What a waste of our time! It needs to close.,1
"Absolutely disgusting! If I could give it zero stars, I would. The smell is awful. The main lobby smells like mildew and the lobby to the room smelled like bubble gum and smoke. Woke up to a cock roach on the wall. Never again! If I ever find myself stuck in Vegas with limited room options again, I'll sleep in my car rather than stay at Circus Circus.",1
"How on earth are folks so excited about these bagels? It's nice that they use Boar's Head meats, but the bagels are completely lacking in texture. My bagel flattened out like it was made of air. Where's the chew? No thanks. I really wish this were just some accident and that I had a bad batch, but I doubt it. I'm baffled by the folks who compare these bagels to ones in the Northeast.",1
Not a fancy look but that's not what matters here. The service was really friendly French and English. The quality and flavour were awesome. The food didn't take to long and it wasn't to quick to be out of a box so you get the feel a lot is homemade and traditional. Lots of variety. I'm a Asian food lover and I will most definitely return here for another great meal.,2
"Despite its Nicely decorated corners that attracts you in with a great view and lightings, the service can be by far the worst i have seen in the Q complex. The servers would just ignore you and purposely delay serving you, as i observed from what happened to our party and two other tables. Never seen staff holding grudges or do as they please. What a shame for such a nice place.",1
"This place used to be nice. It's not that great anymore. Rooms are run down, hard to sleep with all the noise in the halls rooms next door, staff is just okay. And you have to pay a mandatory 20 resort fee each day. This fee gets you 1 K Cup, 1 small bottle of water, and access to the crowded pool good luck getting a chair. workout center. Not worth it.",1
"Just a lovely laid back place. I'm not the biggest sub person, but the atmosphere is hard to beat. The employees are very laid back and friendly, and even friendlier if you happen to come in while in what we might call an ""altered state of mind "". The food is excellent. It's always really fresh and once you try it, it makes Subway look pretty crappy in comparison.",2
"You are crazy not to give Chef Dennis Frazier a chance to wow you with his culinary techniques. There hasn't been a thing i didn't like and the creativity is amazing. Can you believe they can print, yes print on food like a logo. The best part, is the pricing is competitive and well worth the products and services provided. 5 star is not high enough!",2
"Wish I could give this place negative stars. Waited OVER an hour for an order of chicken curry. The employees seemed to have no sense of urgency at all. They would stop to fill up water containers even though there were about a dozen people waiting. When we finally got the curry, it was watery and the chicken was dry. Not worth the wait or money. Ill never ever go here again.",1
"Great traditional Hawaiian fare. Fantastic low prices! Seriously, what a deal! Located inside the Californian hotel in downtown. The staff was very friendly, customers were 95 Hawaiian, it must be a good place. I will certainly return. Bonus, the casino was actually clean and nice.in downtown! Free parking in the garage.",2
"Very good. Service was great, place was clean, and staff was very friendly. Beer was very good, but I knew that going in. Food was the surprise. I had a sandwich which was good and chips and salsa was a great side item. Mom had a steak salad and she leapt say how good it was. Bad points no music and a small table, but I will be bak often.",2
Really like this place. Everyone is nice but not overly chatty to where I can't read my magazine during a pedi! It's new so it's clean and nice with awesome massage chairs. Right now everything is 20 off. Highly recommend the deluxe pedi with sugar scrub and a longer massage plus paragon on your feet.,2
They're not very organized for watching games at all. There are 200 televisions in this place and seven NFL games playing but nowhere in the place can you find a television where I could hear my game. nIt's just not very well designed is laid out so the TVs are all far away and some of them are analog quality.,1
Such a terrible drive through experience. Waited in line for 10 15 minutes between cars. Should have gone inside. Chicken in mushroom chicken was gross and fatty. Barely any beef in beef broccoli and the broccoli was not cooked. I like crunchy veggies but this broccoli was straight up not cooked and greasy. Basically just ate the brown rice with the soy sauce they put in the bag which was good.,1
"I LOVE this place! The owners have created a place that I now think of as my ""Cheers "". Not only are they knowledgeable, but they are so willing to help you find what you need and you do not have to be nervous about asking any question. The wine tastings on Friday's are great, but you do have to get there early.",2
"Great neighborhood joint. We are addicted to their deep dish pizza. The bar is a friendly place to catch a game or have a cocktail. Limited beer selection on tap, but that is really my only complaint and, really, that is only in the bar which is detached from the restaurant . Definitely worth trying!",2
"This place has great food. Love the feel and look of this place. The outside dining area is a bit small. We opted to sit inside because there was a family sitting out there and their child was having a melt down and screaming and crying. Service is fast, but our waiter has the interpersonal skills of a door knob. Work on it!",1
"Livewire Karaoke delivers the goods. Tina is a terrific ""dj "" with a huge library of songs, she entertains the crowd with her own great singing, and makes a dull party fun and alive. No more microphone cords to tie you to a stage, with her wireless mics you can act like a rock star! I'd hire her for my parties again!",2
"Hard to find anything wrong with this place. Lechon Asado and large avocado salad for lunch, 20 bucks. Everything good. The lechon so tender and juicy. The 20 bucks was for two people. We first checked out Fat Boy and saw it was mostly take out so went to Cuba Cafe as a backup. What a pleasant surprise. Will definitely return, again and again.",2
"Nice neighborhood gem in an area filled with lame chains, closed store fronts and awful dive bar food. I've had better Thai, but this place's food is solid an actually makes you feel like you're in a real city for 45 minutes or so. Bookend the meal with a Tsing Tao and some coconut ice cream and you're all set.",2
"Love how she came last minute, it was a TAN EMERGENCY! LOL Sweet girl. Mind you.if she comes to you make sure you have a lot of LIGHT available. I stripped down commando style and my color came up looking the same as other tanning places I've been to. I'm a natural olive tone But I'm sure she's phenomenal with pale tones. If I'm ieed again, she's on my list ",2
"Just ordered from Silver Mine Subs. Despite ordering online so they would have perfect information order still was delivered over an hour later do to going to the wrong address. Driver didn't care as he already had the tip from the order online. Just said ""Sorry bud "" in a bored voice. Hot food is cold now as well, NEVER ORDER FROM THERE AGAIN!",1
"Tell me I am crazy, I did not consume any brats during the time I was here. WHAT! I will say that the cheese curds are pure delicious cheesey goodness, their bloody mary's are above par for a packed college bar in the morning, and their service was great. The location is prime. this is some perfect people watching here. Stamp of approval.",2
I was very impressed with this company. I used them once with a Groupon. I have since booked a regular bi weekly cleaning through them. I love that they will also use my cleaning products along with the ones they bring. I asked them to do that because I like the smell mine has. I would definitely recommend this cleaning service!,2
"Picked up two pies for a Superbowl party. Should have gotten three, they were gone too fast. Great flavor with the perfect amount of sauce. A chewy crust that is begging for the fold over.NY style. Wish they deliver, but even so, the best traditional pizza I have found in the desert. Even better is to stop in for a slice. When they reheat the slices they get and even better finish on the crust.",2
"If you like greek food this will certainly satisfy your craving. It's all about the food here, atmosphere is lacking. Price is reasonable. This is not a chain. Only criticism is the wait, not fast service, but I guess you have to wait for the good stuff. Give this place a try when you want Greek, then go next door to Juju Berry for dessert.",2
This place is amazing! The service and ambiance was great but the food was even better. We had a Rhone wine called Pourpre that I have been searching for online can't find it because it was one of the best I have ever had. The truffle mac and cheese was to die for and the sockeye salmon was perfect. It is pricey but worth it!,2
"As was said, the outside is nothing and parking is a problem, but inside the selection is second to none. They offer cooking classes and one was just finishing when we arrived. I saw lots of things I'd like to buy the kind of things you never knew existed but once you've seen them, you can't live without them, lol. Perhaps we caught the owner on an off day as she seemed a little grumpy.",2
"So we've been sitting here for an hour now since we put in our order and still no food. Normally, I'm quick to forgive. Especially when offered an apology, which we were. The manager assured us our order was corrected and that the food would be here soon. That was 25 minutes ago. Ugh. Won't be coming back here again. I don't care how good the food is. If it ever comes, that is.",1
It is not all that. We didn't enjoy their food hence the didn't care to order desserts. I do not mind paying the price if its awesome! Alarm went on while we're eating and no one came to apologize for the inconvenience. Ambience was better than the servers or food. We will not be back there. I would however try the New York City's Serendipity.,1
"Don't know why I went here. I wanted try something new, but it wasn't on the menu so I went with the spicy chicken. When I got it, it was flat like a pancake with one mushy tomato and a piece of old lettuce. Not to mention really salty. I think in going to be drinking water all might now. When I ordered I had to pull up and wait 5 minutes. At least it was hot.",1
I was mesmerized by the gorgeous books in Assouline. Large and small books of every desire. I especially loved the oversized Equestrian Polo books. It takes you back to the times when books were handed down from generation to generation. I bought a gorgeous coffee table book about vintage wedding gowns. I also want to say the customer service was excellent!,2
Food was decent.wait was long.service was great! When we arrived we were told it was going to be a 45 minute wait. We really waited 30 minutes. The wait staff is plentiful and are very friendly and helpful. The food was brought quickly and was correct as ordered. The waitresses asked several times if we were doing okay and refilled our drinks promptly. Will return!,2
This is the worst bar to goto. The waitresses don't know how to serve properly and they're pretty rude. A lot of their food doesn't taste good. Their pizza is more greasy than Sardellas. The hamburgers are flat but round. Their spicy barbeque wings are pretty good. They have free wifi but constant problems with it. Only other thing is good about this place is all the tvs.,1
"Fast, Friendly, and honest nI highly recommend Rx Garage Door. The man that fixed our garage was knowledgable, very thorough, and upfront about the cost and job to be done. He even adjusted our 2nd garage door at no extra cost. nI was able to pay with my credit card and got a copy of the invoice emailed to me promptly. A company!",2
"I don't think this place is as good as other self serve yogurt shops in the area. I prefer Mojo yogurt. I also prefer Chill not self serve, but great place , but I think Chill is closed for now. The service was not very friendly, and the location is not great. There is nothing terrible about Yogurtini. I just didn't get a great vibe from the place.",1
"Bring a large appetite here because the food is a belly buster! I ordered the half slab of st. louis style ribs combo. The ribs were so delicious! Also, be sure to get their famous french fries! They too were awesome! I'm addicted to good bbq food, so when I find a good place, I do a double take and try again to be sure. And so, I came here again and the food was still awesome!",2
"This place was featured on Diners and Dives, so we had high expectations. We had 4 types of tacos and a shrimp burrito. The carne asada tacos were the best ones, but the meat was a bit dry. The lengua was alright but the pieces were too big. The shrimp burrito had very few small shrimp in it. We live in Scottsdale, and I don't think we'll make the trip to eat there again.",1
"Hanrattys is my go to dive bar. You cannot beat 2.50 bud and bud light drafts. Plus it is also an Ohio bar which I can enjoy. Not much of a crowd but it is a fun place to relax. They have real darts and pool tables. So there is plenty to do. The only downside, is the food. I have only tried one thing and that is the mozzarela sticks so do not try them.",2
"Lighting was really poor, menu description really small, thank goodness for flashlight app. Filled up a little to much on chips and salsa. First brought out soup that was good but all it was is broth. Service slow but they did stop by our table to ask if everything was OK. Good was good, I had Chili Colorado and it was cooked perfectly. I would recommend it if you on that side of town.",2
"I really wasn't impressed by this buffet at all. For the amount of time that I waited in line and the amount of money I had to pay, you're better off visiting ""Cravings "" at Mirage for a lesser price or the buffet at Paris. If you really want to drop a couple bucks on a good buffet, go to the Buffet at the Wynn you won't be disappointed there.",1
What a dive. Just like the whole of downtown. We were seated in this seedyish bar in a seedy hotel in a seedy downtown. Ordered a drink and asked some questions after getting a server to come over. 15 minutes later asked where the drinks were 15 minutes after that we left. Ran back to the strio where we felt both cleaner and safer. Downtown is an adventure bring your machete with you.,1
"I arrived at Applebee's starving. The hunger was like death knocking at my chamber door. I looked frantically for a hostess, but she was busy sweeping the carpet with a broom. After being seated, I was alarmed by the poor design of the menu. It was loud and distracting. The soup was bad. Our steaks did not match the picture the check didn't match the picture. Overall disappointed.",1
I would not spend my money to get anything done here. My nails chipped within 2 hours and toes 5 days. Went back for a touch up and they were not helpful. The color was no longer there. They would not help find and did not offer to switch colors. Said I needed to pay for a polish change. Rude and not great with customer service. Recommend going somewhere else.,1
This place was just ok.I thought the menus at the restaurants wasnt great and in general the service was terrible. The spa was a mess and was poorly run and over priced. On the positive side the rooms were nicely appointed and the gym was fantastic. Overall I would probably never choose to vacation here again.,1
"I have been coming here since the new owners took it over in May and I will not go any where else. Larry and Kate have created a wonderful spa to come get nails, toes, eye brows, facials, all kinds of waxing. I always bring in crazy pictures of nails and they make them happeo matter what. This picture is from today.",2
"The food was delicious and the service outstanding. The owner was extremely hospitable, doing everything possible to accommodate our large party and explaining all of the options available in both Chinese and English for our mixed party. Very impressive and cozy restaurant. We basically rolled ourselves out of there. Would definitely come here regularly if we could.",2
"Far and away the best dive bar I've been to. Nate is light years beyond any other person working any type of customer service, safe to say the best bartender you'll ever have. Great environment, the food is bar food but still tasty Cali burger and cheese curds ftw . The wait staff, especially Alex, are awesome and friendly. All in all it's an amazing place that you'll always enjoy.",2
"Waiting for a table at the Windsor I wandered over to Hard Goods. Wow. What an interesting collection of stuff. First, I loved the Eames chair in the window. Wish I had saved my parents chair from my youth. But the unique concrete creations are the true star of this boutique. Great products. Great staff. Lucas is awesome. Phoenix's secret gem",2
"Quit complaining that it's a cheap restaurant, judge it for what it is. Sundays are my favourite with 69 cent tacos. The trick is to order the guacamole entree and tortillas with your tacos, spread some guac on the tortilla and wrap it around the taco. VOILA deliciousness. Food 7 10 nService 7 10 nPrice 8 10 nAtmosphere 8 10",2
"The curry was very good and portions were reasonable. Highlight for me were unlimited pickles at the table. Perfect complement to curry. Don't underestimate the spiciness level. This was my first time, and to be safe, I chose spice level 3. It still had a kick! Minus one star. They are understaffed. Service was slow.",2
"This place had amazing food but the customer service is definitely lacking. If you go and the place is packed the line wait is about 20 minutes, crazy for a in and out trpe of place. I really wish they could get quicker service lines, accurate to go orders and I'd give them 5 stars but for now due to service.",1
"I love the fact that you can get healthy delicious food here but damn that short girl at the front taking orders has an attitude problem. I ordered two jay cutler bowls and being a tourist to Vegas I asked what goes in it and she blasts off saying ""YOU JUST TOLD ME YOU WANTED IT OMG. "" I just wanted to know what goes in the food I'm ordering and i thought you worked here. Lol",1
"Awful. Pizza was disgusting we ordered the thin crust. I've had better frozen pizza. In fact, this might have been the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of having. I can't imagine why people rave about this place, or why they actually wait for it. I came here expecting the pizza to be amazing. It was, just not in a positive way. Never again. What a mistake.",1
"I was excited when I saw this place was opening because its closer than Marcia's Long Wongs which is where my family and I usually go. I put in our usual order and was very disappointed! Everything thing tasted ""soggy "". The wings were not very good and the fries were soft, soggy and not very good at all. I'm not giving them a 3 star or higher because I think they have a lot of improving to do.",1
"Wow. I've been a long time customer and have always loved the food, but this past weekend I was blown away! I ordered the roasted pork burrito with red sauce which I confirmed was the milder of the two that day and it was probably THE best Mexican meal I've had to date. The pork was soooo tender and flavorful. I'm going back this week!",2
Had a very nice time. 3D Movie was excellent and the butterfly room was breathtaking as expected. Aquarium was small but nice. Didn't take too long to see everything and was a bit pricey especially if you have a couple of kids in tow. Centrally located which makes it easy to get to and bear lots of other stuff. Don't miss the honey bees.,2
"Good Customer Service and good Falafel . IOrdered for their delivery the gentlemen on the phone was good. Delivery took about 40 Minutes which it seemed like it was alot quicker. Delivery Guy was very nice and food was kept in bag and nice and hot. Thanks Sababa for the good food and service. 2 stars only because I have had better, but they are good.",1
"Been here three times now and all three have been wonderful. Good service, good food, and nice environment. As far as cost is concerned much like the rest of Vegas prices are higher. But this is easily controlled by using a restaurant.com coupon. n nPortion size is very reasonable and the table side guacamole is a big hit with us.",2
"Another great, multi meat pizza, plenty of portion, the great Neopolitan pizza of crust heaven, and at a more than fair price. I am always happy when I'm out that way form downtown, by bus to know I will stop in here and enjoy. Also love their american coffe espresso and hot water, yum. I'd give it 5 stars, but, as good as it is, it is only pizza.",2
"I saw the owner sneeze into his hand continue working with food, trays, etc., without washing his hands, including wrapping a piece of cheese for me. YUCK! The cashier was scratching her back UNDER her shirt. Yuck yuck! I thought she was going to handle my food, but she did not. The pesto chicken sandwich was not even any good had just two, very thin pieces of chicken on it. Very disappointing!",1
"The absolute worst massage ever! After our massage, the people demanded more tips! Ive never been to any massage place that does that! Don't go here, its a rip off! It's terrible nIve never been to any massage place that does that! Don't go here, its a rip off! It's terrible nIve never been to any massage place that does that! Don't go here, its a rip off! It's terrible",1
we had to switch rooms due to half the electricity not working.bad smoke smells in hallways. Vegas is expensive and this room was dirt cheap. I was worried about the area and security but it ended up being AOK. The beds were good and air conditioner good. We had a dog so really this was not all so bad. The place needs a lot of TLC though.,1
This place Is not as a good as a lot of the the Chinese super buffets but they had 90 items and everything I ate was good. All the food was was at the right temp. and the service was fast and friendly. This place gets way to many bad reviews so I am giving them 4 stars instead of a high 3 just to help them out.This is a buffet I would return to. So yes I am a fan. chinese donuts real good .,2
"This place was in Park Central and Christown Mall before Air Conditioning was invented. You cannot be around that long and not do something right. I give it 5 stars for quality and customer service. I use to eat there frequently, but now that I'm 44, I cannot eat this type of food as much. Rating healthy choices is a whole other topic, but I think everyone knows what a NY deli is all about.",2
"Super long wait, but worth it. You don't have to sit in front of the place. They will text you when your table is ready, so go to the bar next door and have a drink. Everything we tried there has been good. It's one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The whole NoDa area is nice. Well worth eating here.",2
I went for the atlantic salmon burger and was surprised at it's simplicity and texture. It was also cheap 8.50 . The service was impeccable as everyone had mentioned. Much fancier than its name. I would say more except I opted from getting their famous beef burgers. Their Kobe burger for 60 and dessert burgers sandwiched in a donut seemed decadent. A good meal altogether.,2
"Mike Tocco put a new tile roof on our older Las Vegas home about 8 years ago. They did a great job and I was very pleased. However, I am even more pleased with the service that they have now provided twice over the years when some of the tiles were damaged by wind blown tree branches. The responded quickly and were very reasonably priced.",2
"I'm done with all Tropical Smoothies. Came to this location, ordered a smoothie and a wrap. It was a little busy so I was patient, I waited 15 minutes, after seeing another person that was way behind me getting their wrap, I said something. Yup, they forgot, didn't seem to care either. Why is it that all the Tropical Smoothies by the 89148 area have terrible nservice one way or another?",1
"My first experience at Old Town Tortilla Factory was nearly 11 years ago and this place is just as good as ever. I hosted a large group dinner 120 people in May and we thoroughly enjoyed a buffet dinner sitting under the lights and stars of the beautiful patio. The food was great just the right amount of spice and flavor, the staff was efficient and friendly and the atmosphere was great.",2
Not a big fan of the customer service at this REI location. I don't know what was going on with the employees here but we experienced a lot of passing off when it came to getting help and the person that we were passed off to was the busiest person in the store. Probably because he was the only one working at the time. I was very disappointed to receive this apathetic level of customer service.,1
"Tons of people have hyped up the Wynn Buffet to me. It did not disappoint. Prime rib, roast turkey, crab legs, veal, pasta cooked to order, quality meat and cheese selections and the prettiest dessert area I've ever seen. Totally worth the 30 some dollars. Everything I tried was amazing. If you like buffets, you need to go here.",2
"Meh is right. I actually liked the dated decor. I did not like the dated staff. nOur order was interrupted so that the server could check his tip from the next table. nMy mashed potatoes came out of a BOX. Was served cracked glassware. I didnt enjoy my stay at Bally's steakhouse, and unlikely I will be back.",1
"Fantastic truck. These guys would be a five star in Austin, and that's against some stiff competition. The Naga dog was incredible, great combo of crisp sausage casing, spicy sour kimchee, creamy mayo. Others in my group got three of their different burgers, all with surprisingly complex flavor combos. Now open for lunch, so there's one less reason for putting off trying it.",2
"This is the first time I've been out to lunch and able to find a parking space here. The lot is small for the amount of businesses in this shopping center, even with the dirt lot behind the building. I had the Pick 2 with soup and a pasta. Very good. Good quality food, fast service, friendly staff. I would recommend giving it a try.",2
This review is solely based on our experience at the casino. We did not have the opportunity to stay here. There's lots of things to do in this resort. Lots of good food! This place has a night ambiance and makes you lol feel like you're taking a stroll in a park. My only complaint is that drink service is pretty sparse here and we never got a drink order the entire time we were playing.,2
"Went here for the first time on a Sunday all day happy hour . The prices seem reasonable, however on happy hour the appetizers drinks are 1 2 price. Awesome deals. Vegetable chicken goyza very tasty and the chicken wings were great. Great happy hour deals and everyone knows it, busy even on a Sunday night.",2
"I went here for lunch and ordered a Thai iced tea and the Duck salad. The duck was cooked rare and the salad was extremely spicy, contrary to the server's remarks. I ended up having to leave mid meal and throw up. It was and extremely unpleasant experience. I was so sick that I didn't even have a chance to speak up.",1
"This nail salon, which used to be a nice neighborhood shop, has fallen. On a day I was pressed for time, I made an appointment. After waiting ""just a minute "" for 20 minutes, then using the dirty restroom, and being told ""2 more minutes, "" I decided to take my business elsewhere. I will not be returning.",1
"we tried their chicken pad thai to go for 8.60. fast service. we order right when we got there and it took about 10m for us to get the food. n good to go portion. nice to go plates and utensils. n taste like ""fast food "" pad thai. i'm not thai, but the noodles are wrong. ruins the essence of pad thai. thin, short, viet style noodle in pho? horrible.",1
"very houstons esque. i hear that an old houston's employee started this place. the decor, menu feel is very similar. the chicken was great. they serve cous cous as one of their side options crazy! very tasty as well . their wine selection was varied good as well. service was good attentive. a big plus for a party of 8 people there was no added gratuity.",2
"THAT ICE CREAM WAS SO GOOODDDDD! The only reason I am giving it a 4 5 stars is because I think it's too sweet as you get to the bottom and then the M M becomes WAY too sweet. However, I could eat the waffle cone all day. I got the birthday cake which is absolutely amazing. It really is a Pittsburgh gem.",2
Came in here while in town visiting. The place is super cool looking when you walk inside.They have a few unique cocktails that I would recomend trying. We started w the pita and hummus which was very tasty. I had the lamb burger which was very good but my friend had the scallops which were amazing! I would recommend getting the scallops.,2
They take great care of my sons and they do a great job helping him learn! Staff is nice and professional. I think all daycares are pricey but PCA is a bit cheaper than my last few other centers. One Con for them is they are a little lax on discipline as far as other kids being too aggressive. My son was for sure ready for kindergarten though with their program. And the graduation was lovely.,2
Currently it is raining. Everytime it does rain I lose the connection. I pay over a 100.00 for this service and it really does not deliver. I am going to obtain a digital antenae. I can't believe they actually charge people for this poor service. A set of rabbit ears with aluminum foil would work better than this piece of crap. nDo not consider buying this. n'b,1
If there was an option for zero stars I would give this place that. Wish I had read the reviews first! Horrible place! They did an aweful job on our minivan and when I asked them to ensure they vacuum out the van they tried twice and still missed everything in the third row seats. Please don't waist your time there for over an hour or money at this place!,1
"Used to be better. Bad service now, resulting in cold food and no refills. Also, the bus boy parked a very dirty and reeking cart right next to us while he cleaned the adjacent table. After telling all this to the staff while paying 10 minute wait in line just to pay , they said they were sorry that's it. I'll probably go somewhere else from now on.",1
"Im sitting here, listening to some excellent alt rock i dont know, across a table from my girlfriend, enjoying a coffee and an excellent breakfast burrito, and i cant help but think there are very few places i would rather be on this saturday morning. Its my first visit and i'm hooked. Try this place if you want a genuinely amazing multipurpose cafe experience.",2
"I can't say enough good things about this Cirque Show! Love is the kind of show that just makes everyone It is a delight for your senses! The bright colors, fabulous music, dazzling performers and amazing theatre! Believe the other reviews there is not a bad seat in the house! Seriously, I think the higher up you are the more you see! We absolutely loved it.",2
"My best friend loves this place and I really cannot understand why. Every time we have gone, the customer services is awful. They are rude and take forever! They always get the check wrong! She loves the food, I find it to be mediocre. Not bad but not good. Nothing special. Though the prices are reasonable.",1
"Mediocre at best. Ordered the pad thai and it was lacking something, fish sauce, something was off track. Satay was decent though. I may be slightly biased having just returned from a long trip to Southeast Asia but even the wife agreed the pad thai was missing some key flavors. The map on Yelp is also wrong, it's off of 51st and Thunderbird, not near Cactus.",1
"Friendly folks, lots of seating, good food and coffee my only complaint was that the potatoes were very salty. Other than that, tasty and good it was great to get away from the Strip on our trip and just be with the locals. Our server was lovely and it was an overall great breakfast experience. Would definitely return.",2
"Well I just got wind that this place is closing, now. Apparently the family is going to call it quits sometime shortly. nI've been here a few times with coworkers and I'm not a fan, either. Too cheesy, too flavorless, etc. I think maybe this was the type of ""Mexican "" food that white Americans liked eating 30 years ago. that's the impression I've had of it, anyhow.",1
"Don't eat just drink your calories here! Ask what the special infusion is and if it is the pear kiwi blend, get it shaken in a glass, and be prepared to have your ass handed to you right quick bc those are strong.and good! The espresso martini is also quite good. We, per usual, had great service and enjoyed our visit.will visit again soon!",2
"This revew is for the casino bar I've never had such fast drink service while gambling before. Because I'm not a high roller. Heck, I'm hardly even a gambler, period. The D doesn't care who you are. You get served well when you're gambling your pennies and nickles away. And for that, I will be forever loyal.",2
"The unique nachos, is a great concept. However, I don't think this place is very clean. They seem to cater more to the people who are drinking at the bar, than being attentive to putting out good food. If you like noise, and people drinking, then this is the place for you. This is more like a bar than a restaurant.",1
"This place is great! I went to Postino on a Tuesday night with a friend and it was pretty busy. We were seated right away and the service was great from start to finish. We only ordered bruschetta and wine. The bruschetta was amazing and the wine was definitely drinkable. We ate inside, but the patio did look very cozy.next time!",2
"This place is insane. You can seriously spend hours here, hiding out from the heat and insanity of the LV strip. Location is pretty weird though. A little to close to the other side of the tracks for me. There are 4 levels, and each one offsets the other. There are about a billion stores here where I can't afford anything.",2
"Wait time is stupid. Chairs uncomfortable. No air movement humid stale. A lot of employees are walking around behind the counter chatting. Took 2 hours to finally be called, 5 mins to get helped. So, don't go there in a hurry. nAlso there are people set up outside on the front sidewalk area soliciting for insurance purchase and signing petitions. Makes me feel like its unprofessional.",1
"We went for the breakfast buffet and my lasting impression is WHAT A LOT OF MEAT haha! This is no bad thing for me, but I think they could include a lot more fruit. Anyway what I had was delicious. Eggs done just the way I liked them, awesome bacon and sausages, ham on the bone, granola, fruit smoothie, two types of smoked salmon yeah I really pigged out but at 17 for breakfast you have to!",2
"I'm updating this to a 1 instead of a 3 because in the two weeks since I got my nails done, they chipped and peeled significantly and I went and got them redone elsewhere. I would also like to state that Jeannie commented on here that she would give me a gift certificate to come back and get my nails done and after I messaged her I never heard back from her.",1
"It's set back from the road, so watch for the wooden marquee sign. The place is cozy inside and equally relaxing outside. Cushy chairs, secluded nooks, and service counter to be right up front with the action. Free Wi Fi is bonus and the signal reaches to the patio. Here's the best part they serve coffee AND wine! Nice place for a quiet moment or to share laughs with friends.",2
"Location is great but Service was just ok. Food .eeh. Had the cajun pizza looking deal and it was not spicy AT ALL. Sat upstairs in patio, group of older women directly next us started smoking not cool Plus it is just too tight of an outdoor upstairs dining patio to allow smoking. Ya not impressed, many other places in same location w better ambiance.",1
"Overrated, from one little issue I had with billing nobody would take responsibility, management don't make any of their employees accountable for their mistakes, and gives you the rounds. Completely unhappy and will not recommend it, stay away from this people. Too bad the building and the area are nice.",1
Nous voulions aller manger en famille et au lieu d'aller manger chez St Hubert on a d u00e9cider d'aller l u00e0. Mauvaise id u00e9e! Presque 30 minutes assis u00e0 la table sans voir notre serveuse! L'entr u00e9e des pommes de terre cactus u00e9tait pas bon! Sa baignait dans l'huile et les patates u00e9tait molle! Bref on y retournera pas avant longtemps!,1
"Somewhat lower priced birth control, with really long waits. The centers are pretty much all the same here, just with different hours. The staff is friiendly, but so slow you'd think they're actually MAKING your pills from scratch in the back. But, they are more affordable than your regular doc if you don't have insurance.",2
"The Wedding Room is a wonderful place for a wedding reception, with friendly staff, tasty catering, and beautiful decor. It truly is ""elegant and affordable "", like they say. But it isn't only for weddings, it's also a great location for business meetings and other social events, especially since it is in a pretty centralized location. I'd recommend this place for any kind of social gathering.",2
"This place doesn't deserve even one star. The WORST sushi I have ever had. Very pricey and flat out disgusting. Do not go here, there are so many local places Sushi Fever that have amazing sushi and you will never get sick. My stomach was hurting before we even left the building. Anybody giving this more than one star has obviously never had sushi before.",1
"The only reason this place gets one star is because I can't give it zero. The service was horrible. Our food was given to the wrong table TWICE, half of our drinks never showed up, no one apologized even though we complained, and we were still given a full bill at the end of the night. We will not be returning.",1
"I am a returning customer to Beach Cafe, my parents showed me this place a while back and I find myself coming almost monthly. The smoothies are really good and I have never been disappointed with their food. It bums me out to see how empty it is sometimes when I come in. Well worth a stop in for lunch!",2
Attended a recent event food served outdoors rather than inside . No vegetarian salad options as promised for our event. Place seemed more interested in pushing alcohol. . I would recommend if they have future events to serve indoors . Place has large eating area inside which I would recommend for future event planners,1
"This is my neighborhood Fry's. I have been going to this location since I bought my house two years ago. They are always friendly and things are well stocked. Sometimes they items that are on clearance surprise me as it is an extra bonus, especially if you have a coupon for it. All in all, I have no complaints. Friendly, affordable, what more can you ask for?",2
One of my favorite place when it comes to seafood. I have tried many things on the menu but I have to say my all time favorite are the fish tacos! I have tried the aguachile and it is good I personally would of liked it more spicy and some more avocado which traditionally comes with. The micheladas are Pretty darn good. If your up for trying something outside the box try the camarones culichi.,2
"I am knocking this place off by funding a location here in effen SF. I am calling it. El Chino Bandito. Instead of a mexican panda, I'm using a Chinese iguana with chinkie eyes. He'll still carry two BIG guns a la John Woo and he'll be standing on a magic carpet cuz there'll be curry dishes too. http www.chinobandido.com story.html I shouldn't Yelp when I'm hungry",2
"Horrible! Stay clear of this place, the beds are comfortable in the store and then when you get yours delivered its hard as a rock even after a week and then they'll tell you ""we gonna charge you to pick it up and a 15 restocking fee "" the guys name who does the business is Eric. STAY FAR AND CLEAR from this place.",1
Well what can I say other than I paid 22 for the smallest split breast chicken I have ever seen. Not impressed thought Javier's would translate in Vegas from Oc but epic fail. We sat in the bar area and our server was out performed buy the bus boy. Sad to say because we love Javier's in Newport and irvine.,1
"I've been hounded by their billing people and now sent to a collection agency for a claim that was not mine, i never signed anything and I'm not the patient. What a bunch of crap and I'm lost in their bureaucratic labyrinth. My suggestion, use another hospital, there are lots of them in the immediate area",1
"If this is what Chicago deep dish pizza is about, then New York Pizza will always be number ONE. The pizza was so bland. Theres more flavor with a microwave pizza. The three of us each ate a slice, and left the rest of the pizza on the table and left. We went next door to nothing bundt cakes and we were so much happier with that.",1
I hate Cox! I believe most people will understand what I'm saying. Hate them! When I lived in Ahwatukee i only subscribed to internet. I only watched regular TV and subscribed to Hulu and Netflix. Now I live in Mesa and can't get the channels like I used to so now I had to go back to stupid cox TV. They win my award as being one of the worst companies I ever dealt with!,1
"My lovely wife took me out for my birthday breakfast, had the Farmers Hash w poached eggs, wifey had Buttermilk Pancakes w strawberries choc chips, both excellent meals, service was awesome and drinks were excellent as well. A bit pricey but overall a good experience. We'll be back for the specials on Tuedays",2
"5 stars had they put more rice, but rice portion is generous I'm just a rice eater I want more! Two consecutive meals that I ordered 13 Fish Taco with beans and rice for 7. I love the green sauce that comes with it. I also like how they overflow it with lettuce. I just love it I want it for lunch tomorrow I just had it for dinner today ",2
"The ONLY place a guy needs to know about when it comes to skincare, massages and manscapping! Stacy is the bomb and her studio is so comfortable and relaxing. Seriously, you will want to stay a little longer. I was like a kid just off a roller coaster ""Can we do that again? "" Do yourself and your buds a favor and get over there and get yourself one heck of a 'Head Job' !",2
I love this place. Came here with my friend and it was free champagne for the ladies. They were pouring Pierre Jouet. One of my favs! nSo we proceeded to get schnockered. We danced We drank.made a bit of a scene. Had a super time. nLove the balcony and the view. Glad we were able to party so hard for sooo cheap.just tipped the bartender for the yummy bubbly! nCan't wait to go back!,2
I fought my love for the G Spot but I give in! I decided to spoil my family in East Mesa and brought home the largest container and loaded it up with my fav flavor rocher! Tastes exactly like ferrero rocher chocolate! Mmm hazelnut goodness! They need one closer to home! But for now I def don't mind it being down the road from work!,2
"Wow how far this place has fallen, in such a short time. The douch bags on the phone seem to think that the service and curiousness this place was built oo longer applies. nI mean wow. nThis was one of my most recommend places. Now it's a stay away. nAs good as food can be, service or lack thereof is a reality, and their passion for indifference rates this place as a failed business.",1
"It's not worth the wait. I don't know why people always say to go here. The food isn't very good although I've heard the pizzas are decent and I haven't had one . Last time I was there it was later in the evening and there was a mouse running around our section. I think mice are cute, but not in a restaurant. There are better options out there.",1
"Upbeat and urban very much a change of pace from your everyday breakfast brunch dinner. Staff is friendly and catering to every need. Don't be scared of by the sworn of people waiting outside, good eats await you inside. Looking for some good pancakes you found the place. Fluffy and filling and don't forget the homemade lemonade.",2
"Ok guys, this is a fast food joint! So rating it like its red lobster isn't fair. They are always clean, there's good parking, and I haven't experienced long wait times.but again. it is fast food, so if you go at 12pm then c'mon! I gave it 4 stars because the order does come out different at times, but the ratio is great.",2
"Ok, first off, this place is ridiculously priced! I know it's going to be inflated a bit, but I paid over 10 for a regular old cheeseburger combo. I think I about fell over when my husband showed me the receipt! As for the food, it was OK I guess, nothing worth that price to be sure. Fair burger and pretty tasteless fries. The service was alright, but it was almost empty to begin with.",1
"Nice atmosphere, good service, excellent food. Would have given 5 stars, but our dessert, Lemon Pie had a really hard crust was more of a tart than pie , which made it difficult to eat. Everything else was very tasty with some very interesting flavor combinations. Will make it a point to visit again.",2
"Probably the worst Asian buffet I've ever been to. Food was stale tasting, questionable texture of the meat items, the floors looked dirtier than a homeless persons box and the bathrooms might as well be an alley sewer drain. Who cares if its a buffet, it's still 9.50 for lunch. I've gotten more satisfaction from a lottery ticket that didn't match any numbers.",1
"I stopped by here because of the good reviews. ""Meh "".is my overall review. n1 No one asked to help me find the food I was looking for. n2 the cashier didn't even tell me about the food club until I asked her about it nWill I come back? Probably not. I'll stick to Wag n Wash, they're actually nice and helpful there.",1
"My husband and I just had the pizza from Buck Honey's for the first time recently, so I HAD to post an update. We only ordered the Mac Cheese pizza, but OH.MY.GOODNESS. We ate it at least two weeks ago and my mouth still waters just thinking about it. They use several types of REAL cheese and serve it on a thin crust. Mind blown. I've had mac cheese pizza before, but never like this.",2
Hope the flowers I ordered come out beautifully because I had a bad customer service experience in the store. The florist could not be bothered to help me choose an arrangement and had her friend who didn't work there taking my order. I felt rushed. It was a generally bad experience hoping the flowers are PHENOMEMAL or else I definitely would NOT recommend this place.,1
"This place is gringo heaven, the music is much louder than it needs to be , the food is average by the time you stand in line and order, wait to pay and get to your table your food is less that hot. A co worker recommend this place trust me there are to many good Mexican hole in the walls that are clean and have great food in this neighborhood",1
"I had a lot of expectations coming and since the pricing was comparable to that in LA. However, aside from the friendly service and convenient location, the fish tasted like that out of a convenience store. Presentation was great and the rolls were good too. But the nigiri wasn't anything that I wrote home about.",1
"just saw ""sky fall "" here in full IMAX splendor. wow. picture was incredible but the sound was turned waaay too loud. it was so painful many people sat with their fingers in their ears. some people complained but the staff was not helpful. group in front of us ended up leaving. if you go, be sure to pack ear plugs.",1
"Typically, 20 for a pedicure is a real good deal. Not here. The bad n Not enough staff long wait time, and they get you in the chair so its more of a hassle to get up and leave n Rush job 25 minute pedicure. Thanks for the 2 minute massage n Uneven cut on toenails n Use old polish old polish takes forever to dry Don't waste your time or money here",1
This place place is bomb. And cheap! I mean cheapppp! Plates are priced 1.50 4 max! If u want a roll that isn't on the conveyor belt then just ask to have some fresh ones made. I've tried everything in here some is great some eg not so much. But the price is what is really great. Where else you going to eat 30 rolls for 20 bucks with a tip.,2
I would like to review Panda in the way that I feel about thier food. Panda. nWhile it is convienent. nThere are several dishes to choose from. nThe service is good. nThe portions are adequite. nBut you are sooooo.BORING. I have never really been a fan but the oldest kids loves that stuff. It was her turn to pick the lunch and I had to go with it. There is nothing wrong but nothing great either.,2
On entering we were greeted by the owner of this franchise location. We selected Texas Milk Chocolate and Midnight Magic cupcakes that were consumed mid afternoon with glasses of milk. The cakes were on the dry side and the frosting on each was excessive and overly sweet. A 1.5 rating is most appropriate.,1
"I called around 2 today to see when I could get in for an oil change. Three hours later I walked in and got it taken care of. The woman at the front desk was very friendly and informative. My experience was a great one, and I will definitely go back. I only waited for 20 minutes before I got my car back. Fast service!",2
"If you are looking for a barber, then Brandon is your man. I have been going to him for the last 6 years and it feels good knowing that I don't have to worry about the outcome of my next haircut. Brandon is a master barber and knows. how. to. cut. hair. He is good with the clippers and the scissors too. It's rare to find barbers these days that know how to use scissors correctly.",2
very very very slow service. The guy put the wrong kind of sauce on my sandwich and rather than offering to make it again he sat there for five minutes and try to scrape it off with a knife and throwing parts of the sandwich away. What a ridiculous experience. And to top it off the soda machine was not functioning properly. WORST subway experience ever,1
I actually really didn't like this place. I expected way more because it seemed like it would be really great but the food tasted bland to me. I might be convinced to give it another shot but for the most part I really just doubt I'd ever go back when there's so much great food to be had around here.,1
"First time to eat at this Thai restaurant. The service was very good. The appetizer was great. Good spring rolls . The soup was very tasty and a little spicy, but not too hot. And the price is just right. I will certainly be back! Thanks for a wonderful lunch! nOh, and the Thai Ice Tea is delicious!",2
"This is our new favorite coffee spot.the coffee was great they have almond milk yay! and hubby loved his bfast burrito. Outdoor patio is a great spot to bring dogs ours loved it. Inside, they have local art and reasonably priced gifts, made by refugees who live in Phoenix. Staff was very friendly and pretty quick.great concept, great spot.will be back often!",2
Whatever you do. Don't book through a 3rd party entity AND have a death in the family and have to cancel. The cancelation policy given to me at booking and the hotel cancellation policy don't seem to match up so I am being charged a 200 cancelation fee and not being refunded. Cancelled 2 days prior to my reservation. I would have assumed some kind of understanding might be extended. Guess not.,1
"Got Sushi was great! The vegetable roll was the best I have ever had even vs. places I have been to in Hawaii, San Francisco, and LA. The service was incredibly friendly and was willing to work with us for special requests and requirements. Tons of vegetarian and drink options! We had a group of 8 and we were seated very quickly and comfortably.",2
"waste my money. the shrimp and grits were the worst I ever had. You can tell it was a can product. The crab cake, taste was ok. The first time had it served with no sauce at all. The French toast sticks were a little hard around the end crust. The Sunday brunch had a good menu, but fail short on taste",1
"How cute is this little Japanese store? Thank you for letting me use your restroom. I promised you I would buy something, Japan Creek Market. And so I did.just a few random things that I love. Nametake, Sekihan, Kinako. It's a good thing I had to pee. And a good thing Japan Creek Market was there for me. I'll be baaaack Arnold voice .",2
"I've only had the food as take out my husband brought home, but all 3 times I thought it was really good. We've had the boasted chicken, the cowboy pizza, and the appetizer sampler. We just moved to Gold Canyon, an haven't ad a chance to go there and eat, but my husband said it seems like it would be a fun place to go.",2
"Favorite local pizza place for the taste, quality price. Not pretentious. Just good classic taste. I love their combo pizza about 20 with pepperoni, sausage, olives onions, and we add ricotta. So creamy and perfectly seasonsed. We also ALWAYS get the side of sausage and large order of garlic knots. The real garlic drenching, the awesome marinara sauce and tasty sausage links are worth the trip.",2
"I had an excellent lunch! Emilie M. was on point and on top of her game! The food and drinks were on our table quickly, even though she was busy with tables outside and in. I watched the other servers and they were obviously trained well or carefully picked. I love to eat and actually get Service! I will recommend this place to everyone! Great job Emilie!",2
"Terrible! Some of the worst service and management I've ever seen! Our server said about two words to us the entire time, and checked on us one time before bringing us the check. The manager looked completely unprofessional, he was chewing gum, had blood shot eyes, and smelled like alcohol! The food was overpriced, their pancakes cost 8 without any sides. I will never go back again.",1
"Delicious gelato, generous portions, awesome owner. When you arrive, the flavors are explained to you and multiple samples offered. The owner really cares that you have a great experience. I've never been approached this way at any other dining experience, so this is why I'm writing my very first review on yelp. There are so many unique flavors. Definitely a work of art.",2
This is honestly my 1st review on yelp and I have to say these are delicious. I picked these up at the farmers market last week and got one of every flavor and am not even a huge sweets eater but I like these. They have just enough to give you that sweet flavor without all the junk. Highly recommend whether you're a gym go er or not!,2
No reviews for this place?! We have had the breakfast burrito and the carne asada burrito which were both amazing. I've had plenty of Mexican food and so called Mexican food mostly on the East Coast and this place definitely is among the best. Don't be fooled by the low key location and simple menu. Give it a shot and trust me you won't be disappointed.,2
"Mediocre at best. Wings were dry and tasteless, brisket was full of fat, pulled pork was ok but with a strange after taste and the ribs were nothing more than ok. The coleslaw was good. nService was un attentive when we were the only ones in the restaurant. nWe won't be back n Unfortunate because we really like BBQ ",1
"MY FAVORITE CLUB IN VEGAS! my second favorite is tryst young crowd, the BEST music mostly hip hop and some rock journey 80s ! note thursday nights are house music. and it RAINS MONEY 2 out of the 4 times i've been there ! make sure to get on the guestlist if you don't want to wait in line! no cover if you have one of the pree admission passes!",2
"Sigh. I'm updating my yelp reviews. As most people in QC know the penguin is no longer the penguin. I'm not one of those zealots who wants to throw a brick in their window. No, I legitimately tried to stay open minded about the greedy change. IT JUST ISN'T GOOD ANYMORE. The prices are higher. The food isn't as good. Boo.",1
"I was very surprise how I actually enjoyed Steak 'n Shake. The prices are reasonably cheap and the food is great. Waiting in line wasn't as long as I thought it would be and it was worth the wait. Pro You can't go wrong with burgers and shake! Price is great! Con You will have to wait in line, inside the Southpoint Casino. Smoking environment.",2
"This place is the best! They have better rates than the big banks and they are always friendly and helpful down there. Also, they don't gouge you with fees like the big banks. They have no ATM withdrawal fees at any credit union ATM. Why do you still do your banking at Chase, Bank of America, US Bank, or any other large bank again?",2
"The food is amazing. However, everytime i go for pick up or i order for delivery, i have to wait at least an hour. The other day, i was left waiting for an hour outside in my car. The employees were very rude and slow if u know what i mean. The person that took my order repeated my order several times but still ended up getting it wrong. I wont be visiting to this papa johns again anytime soon.",1
"The people that work here are experienced hustlers! Yes, the place is nice.BUT, way, way over priced! They try and sell you on something you don't need. Im buying a taot a house, chill out. I didn't agree to paying some ridiculous price and the broad at the counter had her manager come over and try to convince me into it. I was not having it.",1
"Went here for lunch on the suggestion of someone who raved about this place. It is essentially like a Qdoba do they have those here? , and in my opinion, Qdoba is MUCH better. This place was, how do I say it? ew. I had a fish taco, and I didn't even finish it. Bland, watery fish. Even the mango salsa was no good. I have no desire to return here.",1
Texas visiting this weekend. GREAT patio. OMG loved every bit of being outside. The food is really pretty good but the tastes here are a smidge different than Texas. I like my food spicy. I had the green enchiladas that were just wonderful and the black beans were NOT bland. The salsa and guacamole are wonderful here. Beer ice cold too. Would come back again.,2
This place still makes it's bills. Still here to stay. So far I can't complain about the place not being clean. But I do hate the prices for food. The theater does have good sized rooms and the screen I normally see is pretty big. Not much to say on behalf of this theater but nothing worth complaining about. Good place for not waiting in line too long,2
"Blah. My family and I went for dinner here on Sunday night. The place was fairly dead, but the staff seemed like they were in a panic. Food was very bland. I had the hollywood burger. Nothing special about it and my fries were fairly cold. Service was absolutely awful. They just flat out forgot about us a few times. Won't be back next time I'm in AZ.",1
I live this place it was so much fun. I ordered the cheesy burger that's not the actual name it was soooo good. The only reason I gave this a four star and not five is because my husband didn't care for the brisket he said it was fatty. Yuk! But he also said he would still go back because the atmosphere was that awesome. Good cause that burger I had was the bom.com,2
"Another good burger in vegas! If you haven't been to Bachi burger, I strongly suggest it. The Kobe burger is my recommendation. It's juicy and tastes amazing! The burger was cooked perfectly. I also suggest the black and white milkshake. Service was great, the only problem is the wait. This is very popular right now, so expect a 20 30 minute wait.",2
This is the worst dry cleaners in Charlotte. They have ruined several shirts and after recently losing a suit if mine I have decided to take my business elsewhere. The owner is also extremely rude and I would strongly encourage anyone ieed of dry cleaning svc to go elsewhere and avoid these hassles.,1
"You know what I love about the TI.and you can call me CRAZY, the parking garage is the SPOT! nGREAT VIEW! No wait, it's a SICK VIEW! nAnd besides that, the TI is central to so many things. When you're struggling to find a spot at the Fashion Show or the Venetian, you should have parked at the TI. nTake my word for it next time and give it a try, you'll understand what I'm saying! ",2
"My family is a big fan of this place. Normally a restraunt inside a casino is not for us. HOwever, this is an exception. The food and service always seems great. The salsa and chip bar is wonderful. They have refried beans on the bar and they are some of the best I have ever eaten. Not sure how they make them sooooo good. nThis place is great. Will defiantely be back over and over again!",2
"I live right across the street from Thai Thai. After a year of driving walking by and thinking ""I need to try that place "" I decided, this evening, to give it a shot. However, after calling 5 TIMES with no answer, I gave up. I don't understand how a place can stay in business if nobody answers the phone to take your order. After all, it is takeout ONLY. I am very disappointed.",1
"It wasn't what I remembered when I last came here. The food was mediocre and the service wasn't great. It took awhile for my husband and I to get our food, considering the fact that there were 4 chefs in the kitchen. On top of that, they forgot one if our side orders. I was a bit disappointed this time around, and in pretty sure my husband washed his hands with the place. Too bad.",1
"This is one of my go to places for gyros. Growing up in Chicago I know what good Greek food is and sadly, Vegas is really lacking in the Greek category. Yassou's does satisfy my gyro craving though every time. The meat is always fresh and the sauce is the perfect consistency. The prices are fair as well. For the quality, definitely worth the price. I just wish it was located closer to me.",2
"This was a distance from the normal places we like to go to eat, but it certainly was worth the drive! We had their cheese garlic bread and chopped salad for starters. Both were excellent. The deep dish pizza was delicious and certainly reminded me of quality pizzas you can get in Chicago. The server was attentive and prices was very reasonable. I certainly would make the drive again!",2
Food was not even close to being authentic Mexican. I have never had mexican topped with cheddar cheese. We had 3 people in our party and they gave us 1 very small bowl of salsa and when we asked for another one we were told there would be a charge. Terrible food and service and kinda pricy. Would not recommend.,1
"Had the Burger with Blue Cheese and Bacon with a side of sweet potato fries. Burger was tasty but very small. Fries needed a lot of salt and were in very small pieces. Overzealous waitress kept trying to take our plates. Two burgers, two sides, one bottled water for 25 is way too expensive for the portions.",1
"There's nothing spectacular about this place. We stopped in before the Jabbawockeez show, because it's right in front of the theater. The food we all ordered was sub par Mexican, like Casa Ole ish for the Texas folks . And it's all overpriced, but this is Vegas so. Nothing to brag about , but it's worth a stop if you wanna get a bite and drink before a show.",1
"Sure there are shows EVERYWHERE in Las Vegas, but for a free show, Show in the Sky is one of the best. They don't hold back, Hot dancers, not One but TWO outstanding singers bring this show to a roaring crowd Thursdays to Sundays. 6 times a night, 3 completely different sets, glitz and the glamour, they got it all. Sexy body shaking good time. Don't miss it!",2
"I've never had a bad experience at Four Peaks. The service is great, servers are very personable and fun go see Carly, she's great! The beer is amazing. You caever go wrong with the HopKnot! Food is delicious. Try the salmon BLT, it's life changing. This is by far my favorite place to eat drink watch sports hang out in Arizona. It's hard to compare any other microbreweries to this one! ",2
"This is a fantastic new craft beer bar! The place before was not good at all! The new people have really made inside this bar modern and fresh! Good craft beer on tap good bottled beer too! I was in today and had ""The Italian "" beef burger that comes with a side of French Frys. It was perfect! Really enjoyed the food! Staff are very good at job! My first time and I WILL be back! ",2
"First time I had Pho in my life and it was Phocking Photastic! The food is awesomely priced and very very good. I got the Chicken Pho and threw in some siracha and hoison, it was borderline addicting. The staff that waited on us did not seem to excited to do so. She seemed upset I wanted to split the bill in two, but oh well. I will be going back again very soon for some more Pho!",2
"If you are buying a Toyota, head on up to Avondale Toyota. The service at this dealership was sub par in the service and parts department which is the only interaction I have had . I was not impressed, I will stick with the long drive out to I10 and 99th and have stellar service no matter what I am in for.",1
"7am.at the airport.where do you go for some veggies? not burger king. not cinnabon.so i figured a sandwich place. ordered their veggie sand.almost 10 i figured it has to be the best veggie sandwich EVER. well, it was the WORST ever. the bread sucked. the veggies were all slimy. UGH. don't ever go here.",1
"I just checked in for a work function. Despite having a confirmed reservation at the Wynn, I was given a room at the Encore. Under the same roof? It's a completely different hotel. 6 acres later, I'm checked in and pissed! I really dislike Vegas to the core. I was excited to stay at the Wynn. Front desk person was respectfully bitchy. Terribly disappointed with the bait and switch.",1
"I am a total dinosaur when it comes to DVDs and CDs, granted yes, I have an iPod and so forth but there's nothing like that CD sound versus those compressed MP3s. Yes, I still buy DVDs but I am old fashioned, just picked up 4 for 10, so why not! The staff is always helpful and the prices are awesome.",2
Sweet Cakes is such a fun and awesome place to eat! Love their lunches and the 5 layer brownie is to die for! The service is great and since its a family owned place I feel comfortable bringing my family there as well. They are CASH ONLY but they take cards on big orders if you ask and they do take checks.,2
"I have had some horrible dentist experiences and just wanted to say that my visit with this office was a breath of fresh air. Every staff member was extremely nice, professional, and very personable which made my visit even more comfortable. Thank you everyone for the great experience! Would highly recommend.",2
"Great place. The burgers are really they are similar to that of Johnny rockets actually the whole place is similar to jpnny rockets. You definitely need to get a shake it was very good. They also mix flavors, they put a on flavor on each side. nThe line get long fast so I suggest getting there for an early dinner or lunch",2
"Stopped in Vegas on our way home to San Diego but didn't want to deal with a casino. Jason's was a perfect choice! 5 min off the freeway. Huge sandwiches, fresh, natural foods, yummy soups, salad bar and a free soft serve cone for everyone! I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but Jason's is an exception.",2
Love this place. I didn't want to leave. Loved the push button curtains. Bell hops took a little to long to bring up the luggage but service was great. Check in was a little long. I loved looking down on the city strip from my hotel room way up. Especially with floor to ceiling windows. I will return again definitely.,2
"Filthy filthy resturant, the cooler system they used to hold items had mold, filthy booths, dirty windows, run down building, 0 dollars are going back in to the appearance , or equipment I could see from the counter , the ice cream was good, but I coulndt get over how dirty and old the place looked . I would bet DQ, would shut this one down , if they seen this joint!",1
"Have been to several Caps around the valley many times, always a consistent brand. This was my second visit to this location, both times have been sub par. Last night was the same. Actually watched the guy making my Bobby picking and eating meat while making my sandwich. Blah. The overall appearance of the place was nasty and dirty. Will not be returning to this location.",1
Went here with some friends while we were trying to figure out what we wanted to do that night. Pros nGood lounge area with a DJ and dancers. nCool decor nGood view of the strip Cons nToo bright nVery smoky nDrinks are WAY expensive 40 for 2 disgusting long island iced teas that we couldn't even drink. nHard to find seating for 4 people as most spots were reserved with no one there.,1
"This place was just all around bad. Not only was I rushed the entire time and they did a really fast and half effort job on my manicure but the guy that did my nails was picking his nose and shouting at one of the other women in the salon, which made him go even faster on my nails. I will say the price was good, but not good enough. Awful service.",1
"Gave it a 1star because there is no option for no stars. We attempted to eat here this past Saturday. Walked in with my family just after 3PM. We were greeted by a man sitting at a table. He tells us that they are closed for lunch. What restaurant in a shopping center shuts down for lunch? Absolutely absurd! By the way, the OPEN neon sign in the window was on.",1
"Love this place! Our go to place when we are hungry. Good for last minute, the staff is super nice, attentive, and care for their customers! nBest Baked Potato Soup, hands down! Never a bad meal here. nOur glasses are never empty, even on a busy game night. nGreat quality, Great service. I can't say enough about this place!",2
"Only because to rate I have to give a star! The place is usually clean in appearance, but service is horrible. I guess the lack of effort is innate to this establishment. Have spoken with manager and it remains to be the same. I know there are other places but the person bowling bowling on a league.",1
"Good Thai cuisine owned and operated by a local Thai family. Typical Thai menu. Portion size seems to be getting a little smaller and unfortunately they removed the non fried items from their 4.99 lunch specials. If you want authentic Thai for an average price and you happen to be in or driving by Anthem Arizona, Dara Thai is a good selection.",2
"There was a problem with my back and front yards and they were flooding. I called Scott in a bit of a panic and he sent out an awesome guy right away, I think his name was Jose, he explained the system I had to me. Turned off the water so that it wouldn't continue to flood and was extremely nice. I'll definitely be calling them in the future for any plumbing needs. Thanks y'all!",2
"great service today! always great food.must try the sonoran dog! off menu, so you have to ask for it.sooo good! my husband always gets it, I get a salas and have to eat some of his fries and sonoran dog! Its a brat wrapped in bacon and rolled in a flat beer bread with guac and fixings.to die for! .and to top it off I had a pineapple beer mimosa. speechless!",2
Beer good nThere's surely a beer for anyone who like beer on the menu. Nothing wow but decent. nFood average to underwhelming nThey play it safe with the menu and the flavor. Its over sauced and yet still bland. nService hit and miss nWe were treated well enough but it wasn't clear to us or the staff who was waiting our table. it took some time to get sorted.,1
"Just stopped by and after I entered was told by an unsmiling woman that ""We're closed, we closed at 6. "" I noted it was ten of six and my item was quick. ""I have three of six. "" was the response. Understood. I am posting this as my iPhone says 5 56. Most importantly, there are other stores on the planet and an internet. I won't be back even if you actually decide to keep your posted hours.",1
"Our service was good. We had a good server who knew what she was doing. I ordered a quesadilla not an appetizer, the regular dinner one. It was awful. There was barely any meat in it. Plus it was in this burnt. dried out tortilla. Terrible. And it took well over an hour for our simple dishes. The server apologized and said they were short on kitchen staff.",1
"If only i can write with negative stars i would do so, check our story of frustration and save your self from all the hassle that this place offer. This summer we got a cute maltese po, we wanted her all taken care of, so we went and got her their wellness plan, plus a whole year plan with heartworm and their ticks and fleas. The nurse who help us when we were choic",1
"Must avoid! The cob salad has no taste, dry, in big chunks that you have to cut yourself or ur eating chicken steak. Lobster ravioli is wet dumpling skin with green peas. What is green peas doing there? Not for taste obviously, just to make it seem not too boring. It used to be better, write this to warn long return customers.",1
"Moved here recently and have been trying to find good Mexican food. While it's not your typical Mexican restaurant they have several different types of meat for tacos. Tacos were 2 a piece and the salsa, pick, and guacamole are readily available in the store. Tacos were awesome we'll definitely be hitting them up for dinner again on a regular basis.",2
Waitress was great although everyone seemed overwhelmed .maybe Bc it's fairly new to open nThe guacamole was excellent other than that everything we ordered was completely over salted our family of 6 couldn't finish anything they ordered Bc of all the salt . Even the chicken and rice soup nWouldn't return thankfully we had a gift card so we only had to pay 80 dollars for food no one ate,1
"Flavor is good. I do like the seasonings. However, my pizza was severely undercooked. I waited 20 minutes for the Pizza, and when I got it, it was doughy, soft, and falling apart. I had to put it in my own oven when I got it home, just to give it some crisp. Also, it was really over priced. 14 for a large extra cheese pizza is pricy. Not at all worth the price.",1
"Yummy! I was unfairly worried that the levels of heat here would correspond to the lack of spiciness found in Arizona, rather than appropriately Thai. Pleasantly surprised to find that they Thaied it up with the heat. The drunkeoodles Kwediew Kaprow phat kee mow were YUMMY. The Ho Mok Ta Lay seafood with red curry was the perfect mix of savory, sweet, and spicy. I was a very very happy girl!",2
I've been meaning to check this place out for a few months now. I finally walked in one day and walked right out. Nothing looked good. I realized there was no other option that seemed good in the shopping center so I walked back it. It dirt cheap in there. You will know why once you taste the food. The bread was the best part of the sandwich.,1
"Normal food, the bun bo hue is too oily and it is not even close with the original one. However the biggest minus point for this place was the waiter and also owner of the restaurant I guess. He was weird and slow and didnt understand me even I speak the same language with him. Bad experience everytime I come here !",1
"The food is decent, but far from the best around the service is good, but I should not need to shout to a person 18 "" from my face at a sit down dinner. There is absolutely no reason for a place that is not a dance club to have music so intolerably loud. It made the whole experience a great deal worse.",1
I am so happy that they are opeow on saturday. After golfing we stopped by to get their famous green chili burritos .they were nice and hot .The green chili sauce spicy and lots of green chilis.the meat was plentiful and the extra sauce went well with their Spanish rice. Their refried beans are the best in town.thank you,2
"The only reason you want to stay in this hotel is to enjoy the Fountain Show from you room. Other then that, this is just an average hotel. I didn't find any difference between this hotel and any Marriott Hilton chains. Rooms are old, dark, and average. But the fountain show from the room is priceless ",2
Not much has improved with this place since the last visit. No mentionable smoke flavor in the meat whatsoever and the pulled pork had little flavor to begin with. The sides were average at best and nothing stood out. If you want good bbq hit up rollin smoke instead. Oh and People still praise the free ice cream. Let's just call it free frozen water with powdered milk product bleh.,1
"The burgers here are awesome! My son and I came here a few months ago for the first time. Everyone was very friendly. The owner stopped by to say hello and ask how our experience was. Have had several to go orders since then. I always get a burger because they are so good, so I can't speak for any of the other items. Great place!",2
"Big fan, especially when taking into account the prices and portion sizes. Service is casual and sometimes better than others, but its an informal place. If you think its a horrible thing to occasionally have to ask for chop sticks, or get your soy sauce from another table or any rather minor thing then consider a more fancy place. Otherwise this is it!",2
"Normally I love Senor Taco but this weekend I went in and got food for my three kids and two adults. First they refused to sell me an extra kids drink. Ok, fair enough. Then they made a mistake on my order, corrected it and asked for my card to charge me an extra dollar. To me, that's just bad customer service. Will def think twice about taking my family there next time.",1
"Whole foods Market is a great place to find many organic produce and also retail items such as soap, shampoos conditioners, natural detergent, etc. I do enjoy shopping here but however the prices are pretty steep. My brother call is whole paycheck .get it? because it can seriously cost a paycheck to shop here. lol.",2
"The lunch specials are a good price, the deliver in the downtown area, which makes it easy for my work. the good is just alright. I have ordered form her twice, and was not impressed. But my coworkers and I have not found another Chinese place that delivers to downtown phoenix. I have gotten the chicken vegetables which had this weird texture sauce with it and the chicken lo mien was alright.",1
"Die Pizza nicht aussergew u00f6hnlich, die Salatsauce nicht wirklich gut, der Nachtisch Tiramisu definitiv nicht hausgemacht nWenn wir in der Ecke sind gehen wir doch 2 3 mal im Jahr hin aber halt eher weil auch am WE gr u00f6 u00dfere Gruppen dort gute Chancen haben, einen Platz zu finden als dass es uns geschmacklich u00fcberzeugen w u00fcrde.",1
Fantastic roasted coffees found nowhere else. Best people in AZ for good conversation regarding coffee and roasts. Great value and none fresher. Best cool weather seating and kind staff. If you have not brewed a pot of their coffee too don't know what you are missing. French press there is more than enough for 2 and wonderful.,2
"I was introduced to this place by my little sister that lives in vegas. Thank you little sis! This place is great! great pho and it's open 24 7! how awesome is that? Service is somewhat pretty fast. We were in vegas last weekend and we went to this place twice! good hang over food! trust me! Prices is decent, good food ",2
Horrible customer service. There salon was darear empty when I arrived and was told that there would be a 20 minute wait. The receptionist seemed too busy getting to the next level of candy crush to even make eye contact when I came in. I walked out without getting served. It didn't seem like she cared.,1
"Ordered 3 2's.and all the large fries were put in one bag.but not in a standing way, but it was all thrown together with fries all over the place in bag. I tried to tell to worker there, and she just turn away, and asked for the manager and now will help. This happen 9 19 2011 4 38pm. A little professionalism would be nice when it isn't busy.",1
Nati's is the best! I've been going to her for YEARS. I take all of my clothes whether its designer or cheap and she makes them fit like a glove. She's my secret to clothes looking like a million bucks even if they are from ROSS. And she knows great tricks like adding lace to something to make it longer!,2
"Ate here with a friend because we were starving and it was easy. .not so fast. The place was filthy, wait staff ignored us for 15 minutes literally.I had to do the ""hey miss can we get some service thing "" when she began helping people that had just sat down. nThe food wad meh and frankly I couldn't get past the dirt factor. .tables, floor, etc. Neither one of us could continue. her",1
I have been to Paymon's several time the last 4 years and have always enjoyed the service and food but have no idea WTF happened tonight! Service was very slow and the waitress was over worked in fact only she was the only wait staff for the night. Food was cold and lacking of flavors. Use to enjoy the place but will never return! Goodbye Paymone's,1
"While the food was good, we will not be returning, nor would we recommend this place to anyone else unless you'd like service that's excruciatingly slow, and pretentious, snooty servers and managers.There are other delicious restaurants in Pittsburgh who can offer this quality of food WITH good service as well. Not worth the wait snub annoyance!",1
"I had to update my review and give them another star. I can't get over how fabulous the service is here. I went a couple days ago to get a nail fix and they didn't charge me which really surprised me. They consistently do a good job, regardless of which technician does my nails. I can't wait to go back for a pedi soon!",2
"Las Vegas is like spring break. Except all of the people are adults and more pathetic. I was hungover, walking on the strip in 2005 when a hooker asked what I was getting into. I told her I was feeling sick and stay away. She didn't listen. I puked and it almost landed on her shoes. That is the perfect metaphor for Las Vegas. A prostitute ducking vomit.",1
"Had my first ""taste "" of Del Frisco's Grille tonight. Although some of the reviews are less than stellar, I thought the food, atmosphere and service were great. I will reserve my final blessing until I have had a full meal there . . . but tonight was good enough to go back with friends and give it a real try.",2
"Love this place! I've never been let down, and really appreciate the different things they do with their cheese steaks here, playing up a bit to our part of the country. The Phoenix is by far my favorite, the fries are hot and crispy, the bread is perfection and the service! The service and the guys behind the counter are fantastic. I work nearby and my co workers and I come iearly once a week.",2
"EEEW NO! THIS PLACE IS SUPER, MEGA TACKY! WAY GHETTO! When My son was younger 6 he asked me to take him there, I did! And OMG we both hated it! And we tried it a second time when my girlfriend had a bday party for her son and It was just horrible. The people that go there are all shady looking, I'd say a dangerous crown. This place is NO FUN! And It's a scary crowd. yukky!",1
"My wife and I eat at alot of 4 and 5 star restaurants.might be an ""early call "", but this could have been the ""best meal of 2012 "" for us.service was perfect.rock shrimp app was delish, garbage salad great, and steaks prepared perfectly wife said her filet was ""better than mortons "" !. Dont miss this one!",2
"It would be great if this place was all organic including the veggies and bread, etc. but it is not. Our burgers were ok, and our fries were terribly greasy. I had a belly ache the rest of the night. Great service, but much too greasy for my tastes. And if you are going to have organic free range meat. go all the way with the rest of the food!",1
Damn you Joe! Please come closer to my hood. I love you so! I cannot really mess with a regular grocery store anymore. They have so many options for a single gal like me that does not want to slave in the kitchen. Oh and the pirates booty puffs are addictive. I really love the indian micro rice I tell EVERYONE to get this stuff.,2
"Operative words for this place are cheap and tasty. Get anything with carne asada. It is actually in a shack, so don't expect too much ambiance other than large wooden tables full of construction workers and college students from down the road. I would suggest calling your order in ahead as the line at lunch can get long.",2
Parvin is phenomenal! I've been going to Parvin since I moved here over 2 years ago. I tried many others before finding her and I have been to many over the years and I can say Parvin is tops! I wouldn't trust my brows and such to anyone else! She makes getting a brazilian wax comfortable. Who knew?! She's awesome!,2
Fox sucks. Booked our vacation through travelocity so didn't pay too much attention to the car rental company. Our hearts sank when we arrived in the car rental terminal and saw 20 people in line with one worker running the check in. The line took an hour with no apology or perk to compensate us for our wasted time. Will never use Fox rental car again.,1
"Had take out from here tonight while visiting family in Tempe. It just wasn't anything to write home about. Not a whole lot of flavor in the Kung Po Shrimp though the shrimp itself was pretty good , and the Hunan beef left a weird filmy taste on my tongue. No dish was less than 10 either not worth it at all. It definitely didn't make me want to go back for the dine in experience.",1
"We got our tickets from tix4tonight for 40. The wife and I had a great time, it was an exciting date. This was my first murder mystery dinner and I would definitely go to one again. The show is now at the Fitzgeralds' Showroom at the Fitzgeralds Casino Hotel on Freemont St. Find cheap tickets here nhttp www.tix4tonight.com locations.html",2
"My favorite Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas. It's a hidden little restaurant by chinatown. I ordered the House Special Tom Yum Noodle dish for lunch along with the Papaya salad. I also ordered to go the Duck Fried Rice, Pad See Ewe and even Pad Thai which is not my fav Thai dish and all three were amazing. Price wasn't even expensive. Under 8.00 dishes. I love it!",2
"If you're looking for a place where you can keep pets and have no obligation whatsoever to clean up after them, this is your place. If you don't like walking over, through, and past dog waste on every patch of grass within walking distance, then keep looking because you'll be grossed out. nIs it really so hard to insist that your residents obey leash laws and other rules about keeping pets?",1
"I came in with some friends and we order beer, the server asks us for id and my friend gives the server his Mexican ID and the manager denied it. We've been here before and servers and managers accepted the ID.We said that's bullshit and he tried to be a smartass with us about it which is disrespectful. Never coming here again",1
"Pretty good upgrade fast food eatery. We stopped here for lunch. My boyfriend had a cheeseburger with onion rings the thickest you may ever find . I had a breakfast sandwich wasn't too hungry . It was really satisfying. Prices a little on the high side, but that's OK because the good food is worth it. Nicely decorated in country style decor. Pleasant restaurant. Recommended.",2
We sat out on the patio this time around and it took about 20 minutes just for them to come and serve us. Once they finally did we got drinks and waited another 10 minutes for the drinks to come and for us to order food. Our drinks were constantly empty and they were out of some of their food. I normally like coming here but this time around wasnt a great expereince.,1
"I am taking geology classes. Had to check this out and was very pleasantly surprised as it really gave me perspective and I found myself more knowledgeable after relating to the different minerals. PS a diamond is a mineral not a rock, who knew. The prices are very reasonable and the place interesting and educational. I recommend it.",2
"Fresh delish. 1st time visiting this BBQ place, and was on the lookout for a non chain spot. This family owned spot hit it. nI placed a phone pick up order for a tilapia dinner mac 'n cheese fries . 10 15 minutes lster, picked up a nice, fresh and hot dinner. It was still piping hot when I arrived home. nAlso ordered a slice a peach cobbler. Delish. nWill return.",2
"Excellent service by Felix! Delicious food. Best Wedge salad I've ever had. The filet mignon with blue cheese crust is ORGASMIC! Loved the crab cakes. Best onion soup. Only complaint is the MUSIC. A place such as this should have a great mix of jazz and blues. Pandora exists people, get with the program. The music that was playing belongs in a mediocre sports bar.",2
"25 DUDES! XS.Limo from hotel to club, no lines, no wait, straight to table with dranks. What more can you ask for?! Craig and his team did it. Will definitely use these guys again. Thanks for making my bachelor party a memorable one. I love Vegas even more with these guys around to take care of you.",2
One of the worst Italian restaurants I've ever been to. Food is terrible. It's American Italian and its worse than olive gardens. Need I say more? Service was really slow. Pasta was not cooked al dente and was flavorless. Why oh why. Such terrible food at an otherwise beautifully decorated restaurant.,1
"The only offal item on the Applebee style menu was lengua, and that was so dry and tough! Can an authentic Mexican restaurant really not offer other offal options? I think not! If i wasn't there to meet up with some old friends who got a recommendation from another friend , I would have turned around and left after just stepping through the front doors.",1
"For a place whose specialty is steak, I had the toughest bone in rib eye I have ever eaten. Too bad, as the rest of the meal was pretty good but no excuse for shoe leather like steaks at a steak house! My wife's' filet mignon was done nicely and the sides were decent but I couldn't honestly recommend this place.",1
"During the lighting it seem amazing.like a heaven on earth. I am animal loving person so it drive me crazy when my companions are zoo animals. This zoo is definitely better than The Brookfield Zoo, The Lincoln Park Zoo, San Francisco Zoo, The Bronx Zoo, The Tampa Zoo, The Fort Worth Zoo. I am also a member of zoo and go there most frequently.",2
"We needed some bumper headlamp repair on husbands car. Nothing to major but other places quoted us crazy prices. All Team collision took care of us for a more then fair price! Kept us updated daily either via text or phone call, which was great because there's nothing worse then sitting at home wondering impatiently,when and what's going on with your car! Thank You All Team Collision!",2
"I love spas and I love the Bellagio. But I have to say for 192.00 including a 30.00 tip 162.00 for that manicure and pedicure was not worth it. It's not that it was bad, heck I even brought my owail polish, but Asian women do a far superior job at massaging the hands and legs. I'll rent a car next time and go to the Korean place across the street from the Station Casino.",1
"TERRIBLE PLACE! HORRIBLE FOOD! Bell Rd 23rd ave. They got our take out order wrong, then we found a nasty hair in the food. We called the manager to let him know and he was in complete denial and said he could not do anything about that on a take order. This place is not clean inside and is a complete rip off! Don't waste your time or money.",1
Cirque du soleil zarkana is the epitome of the creative imagination of a masterpiece with artistic beats and themes. The theme is mind blowing and it's a magical experience. It starts with drum rolls and turns into suspense and humor at the same time! I would travel the world to see all the cirque du soleil performance. Choreography is perfect and the costume design is amazing! Very majestic!,2
"I ordered the chicken tenders and they are awesome. Hand battered and huge, twice the size of most tenders. Comes with homemade chips that where just as amazing. nThe place was very nice, well lit, and felt like a nice place to bring the family. They however are unable to serve anyone under the age of twenty one due to some kind of smoking law. nI will definatly be going back!",2
"Dear Doorman at the Palms This review is for you. You ruined my night with your recommendation to go to the Penthouse Club for a strip club. If you want to loose your clientele, keep referring us to crappy AS , kick back, broke back, strip clubs. See my review for Penthouse Club. I hate you Mr. Doorman. You owe me three hours of my life back.",1
We used to come here late at night after work and we'd order pizza and have a couple of beers. It was amazingly good 2 3 months back but today we ordered the same topping since and it just tasted bland! It wasn't the topping. The sauce may to have seem bland. It used to be great. We just hope it'll be better next time.,1
I FINALLY convinced my co workers to try a new sushi place and got them all to come here! We came last minute in a group of 6 and were seated almost immediately. The staff there was amazing and super friendly. Food was just amazing as before and very accommodating for the picky grump we brought with us! GO GO GO!,2
"Seriously, get a drink at another bar in D terminal. This place was absolutely horrible. The bartender was an ass too. I'm sorry you're about to get off of work but no need to complain when I hand you a credit card because it takes you a little bit longer than cash. Also, don't sigh when I ask you to put it in a plastic cup instead of a glass so I can take it back to my gate.",1
My wife the quilter and I found this place busy on a Monday about closing time. Great selection of fabric with good samples to the point the space was a little crowded. Lots of notions and patterns with precuts available including 1 2 yard cuts. Prices on the high side. Staff helpful. As the husband I did not see a place for husbands to sit and no restroom in site.,2
"Very hard to find pick up bus stop from the Cosmopolitan. Then I found out that the copious advertising was worse than misleading, it was downright wrong! The advertising suggested you could get on and off their buses all day long as if they had lots of buses running! Not true! Only 1 or 2 buses, and they may make no stops at all! n The tour narrator did seem knowledgeable, and somewhat friendly.",1
"The hostess waitress clipping her nails at the cash register should have been my first clue to turn around and find a different place to eat for dinner. But, we had just moved to Las Vegas and were hoping to find our new ""pho "" joint so we were willing to actually try the food first before we passed judgement. Unfortunately, our first impression was correct. It was NOT good.",1
"Great!. Packed on a Sunday afternoon! 5 glasses of wine all day like 20 to chooses from which is 4 7 off each glass! Oh yeah, 5 pitchers of Hoegaarden too! Great service, great energy just like every other time we have been there. Postinos is what other wine bars try to be but usually come up short.",2
I just finished a green chilie pork burrito from New Mexican Grill. First time I have been. It was absolutely delicious! The owner was very friendly and welcoming he explained all about his food and what set it apart. They prepare the food in front of you so there is no mystery there. Can't wait to go back and try their breakfast burritos! Hooray for great Mexican food in Gilbert!,2
Worst tasting gyro ever. Got my gyro delivered it didn't have any flavor. They put very little lamb in it. It was more pita bread than anything else. The baklava was a tiny piece they put a weird red sauce drizzled on it. Why would you do that to a dessert that should taste like honey pistachio? nAt least the delivery guy was prompt nice. Going back to paymons. Oh well.,1
"I'm not normally a fan of attorneys, but after a friend introduced me to Tobler Associates, I am willing to make an exception. After talking to Nathan about an accident, he was very concerned and I knew his team would take good care of the situation and make things right. It's hard to know who you can trust when you get into an accident. I trust Tobler Associates.",2
"This is easily the friendliest bar in Las Vegas. It doesn't look like much from the outside. But inside, you'll find a great crowd of mostly locals. The service is quick and the drinks are strong and pretty cheap . If you're visiting, it's good to have the address handy most cabbies haven't heard of it. Also for visitors like many gay bars in Vegas, it's cash only. But they do have an ATM.",2
"I don't like this one either. Came here twice but didn't find a thing each time. Also, the last time, a druggie lady with her druggie friends stole a bunch of things she was carrying a huge tote bag. One of the employees tried to stop them but they just drove off. Like all Savers, it is well organized, but the selection is just bad.",1
"Fenwick's Sunday brunch is the shizzzzzz. I dream about it. Not only is the food amazing and fast! , but the two ladies who always work this shift are the absolute nicest. And just a smidge sassy! Love it! The mimosas and bloody marys are MASSIVE. If you're a philistine and not in the mood for breakfast, their burgers are the best I've had in Charlotte. I wish I could move in.",2
There rooms smell like wet dog i seen someone overdose on the stairs theres no way to get into the front desk the whole staff is rude theres nothing i can say good about this location don't even waste your money to stay with there one night there Wi Fi sucks and the complimentary breakfast is just cakes and coffee never have i stood in such a slum in my entire life bad bad bad,1
"After being very hungry from a day of climbing, we thought we'd try John Cutter. It was a medium volume night, and our service was slow, the food was good but not spectacular, and the prices were high. Even for Vegas standards. I've never written a review before, but our experience was so lousy that It inspired me. Go to the Italian or Chinese place right beside John Cutter.",1
"Horrible. Overcooked reheated buffet items in sticky congealed sauces, pedestrian offerings, flat and exploitative of the lunchtime crowd. The attempt at a sushi bar was miserable. The kitchen should tick to stir fry. Go elsewhere, avoid this dive at all costs. Not even worth an attempt to make this review funny.",1
"Had the Smoked meat sausage and it was great! You could see the pieces of smoked meat inside and the homemade pickles really served it well. Definitely a quality hot dog! I'm not giving a full five star only for the tiny fact that I think the pickle salsa should be drained of the juice a bit more as the bread quickly became soggy, Oh well. Still yummy",2
I really liked Plush. I took my mom here on mother's day for facials. The esthetician I forget her name was very sweet. She listened to what both of us wanted and personalized the treatments accordingly. I thought the price was very reasonable for service. I do have one complaint however. I had asked her to concentrate on my blackheads but she did leave a few stray ones.,2
"Visited there June 6, 2013 in the early morning. Probably right after it opened. We were NEVER acknowledged by staff. It was empty inside and I walked right past them several times to see if they would say something like hello to me. Bad customer service. But there is all sorts of Coke drinks, clothing, accessories and home decor. A Coke drinkers dream. But I prefer Dr. Pepper! ",1
"Found at Atherton Market! This IS the Honey I've been looking for and LOOKING for! Tasted several of the infused ones ""Vanilla Bean "" was very Nice and bought the Wildflower! This is supposed to be one of the most ""Local "" if you live in the South Park Area! I'm eating to fight the Pollen when I'm here!",2
"Second time I have used them. Will most likely never come back. Armor all put right over dirt, dust and grime to seal it in. Multiple areas of the interior not even touched! Low quality work, low quality people and now a low quality location after full circle took over from Danny's. All this for 120. Stay away and give your hard earned money to a business that deserves it.",1
"Got there at 5 30 and I was told the wait us an hour and a half! Forget that! Also the entrance is set up so bad it's annoying! You check in, enter, and exit all into a narrow doorway! Really?! The first '1 star' I ever gave! Maybe they'll work the kinks out eventually but the doorway will remain the same!",1
"They'll fix your car, but they'll charge you more than other places and won't give you a quote until your car is in their shop. Also tried to upsell me on literally everything in my car including things I had replaced or fixed 6 months or a year ago brake pads . Seems like a sketchy establishment, I'd look elsewhere.",1
"We went here for dinner last night. To start, the rating is very misleading. The prices are on the high side. The chop salad was amazing per the previous reviews but the entrees we ordered, Lamb Burger and Chicken, were both overcooked and very dry. I can see going back here for a happy hour but never for dinner. Just not worth it.",1
"I was craving halo halo so I found this place on yelp. Came in and ordered a halo halo and of course, Lumpia. 8 pieces an order for 4. I ended up ordering two orders of Lumpia, because who can resist? The wait was a little long, but it was worth it since everything was fresh! The lady working was so sweet and made me feel right at home. Halo halo was perfect!",2
"Joy would sum it up. Beautiful butterflies flying all around. Come for experience rather an expectation. Four stars because it was fun, interesting, and unique. nChildren love seeing the butterflies, photographers enjoy the easy access to great photo shots, most importantly this was a great place to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday.",2
"i stayed in one of the suites and i can only say good things about my stay! housekeeping was amazing and attentive! concierge actually picked up the phone. i did have a little problem with the valet attendant though, he was extremely rude but i was living in luxury that weekend for me to really let it get to me.",2
I had an outdoor water leak. Called them to schedule appointment with a very friendly lady. They showed up when they said they would handled and fixed the problem quickly and professionally. They then sent a nice thank you card along with a Starbucks gift card in the mail with was a very nice touch. Nice to deal with a well run classy business!,2
"Was there sunday night to see the band Elvis Monroe. Those guys are awesome by the way! Anyway, its a cool spot downtown with a cool vibe. Drinks are kind of expensive but they got some good stuff on tap. Randy Couture was even there and went on stage to play with the band. Cool spot, it was a fuight",2
"The food is way overpriced for the quality. We had spring rolls more greasy than most and soggy in the middle. My pad thai tasted nothing like pad thai just grease and a cheap sauce, no flavor. My husband had the house fried rice and it was steamed rice with a few veggies and cold shrimp. He had a coffee and I had green tea. Our bill was 60. Nothing was good. We will never eat there again.",1
I was devastated when Chuy's closed. but this place will do a nice job to fill in as my new local happy hour spot. Chips and salsa are complimentary and yummy. Tried the chickeachos they were delicious and too much food for even two of us to eat. Service was quick and waitress was friendly. I will definitely return.,2
"My only complaint is that they won't refill a prescription over the phone. You have to make an appointment to see someone and pay a co pay. Other than that, this place ROCKS. I see Maria Jaten, a nurse practitioner. She's the most amazing provider have ever had and I would rearrange my schedule to see her instead of getting right in with someone else.",2
"Number one store in phoenix hands down. Ken is always ready to talk to you about comics, tv, or movies. And the discounts at this place are outstanding 20 off new releases, .01 variants when you buy 5 or 10 comics on release week, 10 military discount or student discount. Free bag and board. How can anyone beat that! Make mine Drawn To and add it to my box.",2
"I drove past a few times and said to myself, wasn't that a bar a couple weeks ago? Were they really able to open it up into a restaurant that quick? Yes! And the food is amazing! The staff was extremely welcoming and my pineapple chicken curry gave life! Not to mention the delicious cocktails as well! There is no doubt they will be seeing a lot of me and my husband!",2
One of my favorite places to go out in Montreal. Great to get a drink and smoke a cigar. Cigar selections is great and the staff is very helpful in showing you around the walk in humidor to pick the cigar that fits your tastes and preferences. Great selection of drinks. Personally enjoy the Absinthe and the Alexander Keith's.,2
"Definitely not worth the hype. Beware of long lines and wait time around the lunch hour. nOrdered the baha salad and chicken avocado wrap and the order was confused. Ended up picking up two sandwiches and had to wait for the order to be straightened out. nThe food was good, but not worth the wait or hassle.",1
It gets 4 stars because it is Waffle House. and we don't have them in Cali. nHowever my Brother would disagree and I have plenty of friends that call it Awful House. one down side on this location.come on guys mop the damn floor.kind of gross. Was a cutie seating near me at the counter. I got my Waffle House fix.cheese egg special for me Cheap as Hell.wish we had them in Cali,2
"This is absolutely a good place to eat sushi in Vegas. The happy hour is when you should go! Their rolls, ramen, and sake is delicious! The bar in the front is very cute with the table that can see through the mall, you can secretly people watch. LOL. The inside is more intimate. I don't remember it having background music, so it's very quiet for you to talk.",2
Soo this place isn't fancy but it makes for some great people watching especially with the lovely Amy C and they have some damn good wings. My favorite were the Honey Hot BBQ. Such great flavor on them! And you have to try the blue cheese dressing it's totally with it.and the calories associated with it! Ha! I'm already looking forward to coming back.Wangs anyone?!?,2
"Went to this spot on a recommendation from my boss. Even though it's far from downtown, it's open 24 hours and getting their smoked meat platter and special Jarry poutine, it's to die for. My only gripe is that it looks dated and the coleslaw I had wasn't too great but that a pretty minor, will hit this place up more often when I visit Montreal.",2
"Worth going to in order to get away from the middle America genetic freak show that the strip has morphed into. This is the old Vegas, the one without Danny Gans and Carrot Top. Where it's all about sleaze and money, and most importantly, where you can still get a free drink and not feel like you're being raped and mugged by corporate America. r n r nFremont street rules!",2
"Just take a cab unless you like being told a 15 minute window they might show up in and then have them show up 20 minutes after the end of that window, have them damage your bag in their rush to catch up to their schedule and then subject you to listening to bible stories blaring over the radio in the shuttle. Like others have said, take a shuttle from the airport and a cab back.",1
"One of the best food trucks in Vegas, plus now they have an awesome HQ. So glad that they're doing well. I have never been disappointed with any of their sliders, and always enjoy trying their mystery sliders every time I stop by. Also, they do these crazy awesome fries at their HQ, and even have these sweet potato s'more fries, which are actually really good.",2
"They had a big selection of what I was looking for. Men's shows in the size I needed. They have large and wide shows, but only on some brands. They have long rows of shows. The service is Ocheckout was a breeze. There were discounts and sales. The clearance section was nothing to rave about, but at least it exists. Price are good.",2
"Mexican food isn't usually my go to when I'm hungry, but I truly enjoyed my experience with Taco Y Taco. I kept hearing the ads on the radio so I thought I'd give it a try when I was in the area. The service was friendly, the food was delicious, and the ingredients were super fresh! This is probably the only place in town I'll go to for Mexican food.",2
"Thief's! THEY STOLE 20 FROM MY CAR! I've never had a problem with my reserve cash when I had my car washed at other places. The store manager only offered credit to get another wash, which of course I was not interested in. DO NOT EVER DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE! Oh, they also blew out my left speaker and left tons of streaks on the windows.",1
"Seafood tasted frozen. Roasted duck was pure grease and fat. The Cheese tasted like Kraft. The Shu Mai was ok. I got sick. I literally got sick from eating here I don't think it was food poisoning, but my body was very upset that I came here, instead of arguing with my friends more about where we should have gone.",1
"In some ways, this is a perfect bar. It's a neighborhood pub in a residential area, it's small with old wood floors, small booths with stained glass, taxidermied owl, a wall of whiskys, boubons and scotchs, Guinness on tap, friendly no stress staff, regulars being friendly to each other and to strangers at the bar.",2
It is amazing what constitutes customer service these days. I needed a new setting for my 1 1 2 carat blue diamond as it has gotten loose. The clerk not only appeared put out that I needed assistance but also proceeded to condescend and ask if I knew the difference between a ring and a setting. Never going to a Brownlee's again.,1
"If you think Filiberto's is good food, then you will like this place. nFish tacos were dry and as tasteless as the lukewarm beans and that fluffy rice thing. I love Gilbert and want to support the mom and pop's but this is not good. nHow has this place been around so long is beyond me. I've driven by it for years and figured it must be great so finally gave it a try. Bummer.",1
"What a ride! Looking for something to do one morning in Vegas, we considered Hoover dam, zip lines, dune buggies, and then the idea of a Segway tour came up. We met up with ""Segway Bob "" on Freemont St. and he took us all over town. After a great 90min tour to numerous places around the old strip he turned us loose for 30min on our own. It was a Blast!",2
I've never seen such junk in my life. Right when you walk it its a crap show of way overpriced junk. The owners definitely took this store way way down. You can't believe the junk outside and in the front room. It gets better in the back if you can even get there. They need new fresh sellers. I bet this stuff comes out of trash cans or they pick it up from people's rubbish. So so sad,1
Bleh 14 for a smoothie? Not worth it. I expected it to be amazing but it sure wasn't! I forgot the name of the smoothie I had. But I know it was suppose to have bananas and grapes in it. I didn't even see the lady put those two ingredients in there! That alone made the smoothie super bland especially because the almond butter and coconut water made it super grainy.,1
"Great neighborhood coffee place. Baristas are very friendly and I love that they are very understanding of my needs and always make my decaf drink whether it is coffee or tea with a smile. Love the atmosphere here, from the fountain outside, to the tables where you can sit and chat with a friend. It definitely keeps me coming back.",2
"Felt like aice apartment complex. Rooms are very spacious with couches, dining table, sink, and big bathroom. The rooms are fairly cheap in price, got mine for 25 a night. Drawbacks? The rooms do look a bit outdated, kind of stale and not much to look at with a small TV. Yes I understand its a few blocks away from the strip, but I am reviewing the hotel and wont knock it down for that.",2
"There was an issue with the product I purchased. When trying to explain, denied a refund. Didn't appreciate that. Just know that if your product is defective, you don't get get refunds here. Ok experience during check out. Not so great upon returning the product, once I was told I was not receiving a refund. Buyer beware.",1
Scammed with private trainer sessions.they make anyone a trainer. Front staff semi professional.one girl was rude. Manager is unprofessional. They kept many sessions of private training when after 3 months i was done with the lack of training and attending the crowded dirty.i am no longer paying monthly or attending. Truly the worst experience.DO NOT JOIN THIS GYM,1
"I stayed here two nights for a wedding. The staff was very friendly and they offered 24 7 shuttle van service within a 3 mile radius. The rooms were very big and are equipped with a mini fridge, instant coffee maker, hair dryer, iron and board. The area was also very pretty and quiet it's a great place to go if you want to get away from the city.",2
"Wet Republic was my first pool party loved it! The music was great even though there was no DJ headlining. Wet has massive multiple pools. It was scorching hot when I went the cement was burning, so I would advise to get a Cabana. It is pricey, but it's normal in Las Vegas. There was also drink specials which is great! Buzzed and dancing in the pool w friends awesome experience!",2
RESTAURANT INFLEXIBLE. Reserved table for wine pairing dinner months in advance with the understanding that one of the party didn't eat meat. nTwo days before the dinner we were sent a menu which contained no options other than meat. The chef refused to alter her menu to add a non meat option. nChef too self important to accommodate clientele.,1
"I have yet to have anything from Lenny's that wasn't outright delicious. The fries are absolutely amazing. The only downside, which may actually be a positive, is that it is really busy during lunch time and there isn't much parking. Other than that, it's one of my favorite burger shops and the prices are really good.",2
"One of my favorite places in Champaign! They have the best cupcakes, and we also ordered our wedding cake from them.it was AMAZING! Amanda is so talented and easy to work with. She listened to everything we wanted and had so many creative ideas that made our wedding cake so much better than I could have imagined. She also worked with us within our budget. I love this bakery.",2
SLOW! Sat in the drive through no cars ahead none behind for 16 minutes. All I ordered was a grilled Santa Fe style chicken sandwich. I rarely go to this location because of the wait. How ever 16 minutes is FAR to long for one sandwich. I live 2 3 minutes from this location and when I got home the bun was all soggy. Seems a bit fast to me for the bun to be all soggy. I will never go there again.,1
"Sum bitch! The server ""Ian "" ""josh "", whatever name he claims was rude and aggressive. Food was cold and not worth it. Got a discount but wasnt worth 1 dollar. Apparently all meatloaf comes cold and loaded with tomato sauce with brown gravy on top? Next time I need something from the freezer I'll go to food lion!",1
"We dropped by for dinner around 6pm on a Sunday night. There were a few other customers, but not super busy. We ordered a burrito and a stuffed sopapilla. Both were generously sized, good tasting and reasonably priced. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Definitely a nice place to get some tasty grub!",2
"Wonderful service and comparable prices to other pizzeria's in the area. Used to order from La Familia pizzeria on Durango, until the service I received over the phone was unacceptable. The opposite is true for Angelina's, phone service is A , delivery fee is kind of high but it's because of my far location I assume. Great food and desserts. I would r ecommend ",2
"took in a sundress to get altered, the seamstress was a kind, quick and efficient as can be. the front desk staff was very sweet took the time to explain the 24 hour valet service which is awesome pick up the dress later that evening, using the 24hr valet at a very fair price. will be back. seamstress isn't there everyday so call for her hours ",2
This review is for breakfast. I ordered the sampler and everything was luke warm. The yolks of my over easy eggs were solid. The portions were huge and the pancakes were tasty but everything was overpriced. With the price I paid please bring my food to me warm and cook my eggs right. Even my mimosa couldn't redeem my experience.,1
Delicious! I love the salmon and lamb dishes. Their buffet on the weekends has a great variety and excellent flavor. The wait staff are enthusiastic and give great advice for helping choice a meal. They also know their food inside and out. I always come here with my Indian friends and try what they suggest. We all love it. You cannot go wrong with the Blue Taj!,2
"I'm waiting in the lobby for our pizza as we speak. Its like a fucking ice berg in here. In the lobby. Freezing. And the front counter people are rude as hell too. When I got the pizza home, it was ok. I would never go back here though. I can't tell you how cold it was in there, literally shaking. Nice and warm in the back, I'm sure. Customers come second.",1
"If I could give these guys a zero I would! They are a TRAIN WRECK! After screwing up my pool on their first three service attempts, I decided to find someone else. It goes without saying they did not live up to anything they promised. nAND GUESS WHAT? When I cancelled the service, they threatened to lien my property! Run far away from this mess! Could not have been more disappointed ",1
Came here on a Sunday night to start off the night. It sounded cool by the description but we all found it pretty lame. There was only 2 shadow dancer screens and they weren't very interesting. Also they started closing down just after midnight. Its ok if you want a quick drink but I wouldn't spend a considerable portion of the evening there.,1
"This place is a joke. The dental industry needs some regulation because the prices here are 3 times more than other dentists in the area. Called for a quote on a simple tooth extraction and they wanted almost 400 after fees and such nonsense. The dentist may be good here, but the prices are outrageous. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.",1
"Stopped by here for dinner before seeing a movie down the street. I got the teriyaki chicken dinner, which comes with miso soup and salad. Everything was very good and the price was great, I'll be back for sure. Even though I didn't order sushi, I overheard the waitress explaining some of the rolls to the table next to me, and she really knew what she was talking about.",2
"I got a pizza delivered and the whole experience was mediocre. The crust and topping were.ok. nI got a pepperoni,mushroom and ricotta pizza. It looked like the ricotta came out of a squeeze tube it was zigzagged in large trails across the pizza, it just seemed like a little more effort could have been applied and the crust was a bit dry and over cooked.",1
"These people are liars. I asked if they were in the Aetna network, they said yes. Now I come to find out they are not and they expect me to pay when they lied to me. The lady on the phone says they are told to say they are ietwork for all insurances, that they take all insurances. Now I caot even get a hold of their billing department. Beware of the pop up urgent cares. Bad mojo.",1
"So when this place first opened it was pretty good, but now the quality and service has gone downhill and I will not be returning. I love Hue food and refuse to eat mediocre Hue food or support a business that do not value their customers enough to keep the quality the same or try to improve their quality.",1
"Wouldn't even rate a one star, but it's the minimum rating to write a review. If you want to start a trip off with bad attitude, horrible customer service, wrong orders even after verifying it several times , an over priced menu even for the airport higher price normality . Then go to Taquileria inside the LV airport.",1
Review is just for the juices. nCame here for my daily dose of green juice and this place didn't disappoint. nFreshly made just pick on the menu combo they have on the wall. nTry their wheatgrass shots for 3! or you can have the blood transfusion with a side of fresh coconut water nTry this place for your juice cravings.,2
For god sakes DO NOT GO ON KARAOKE NIGHT. I don't normally consider myself a violent person but if I had to listen to a little kid sing the ABCs again I was going to break the microphone. Its been 4 months and I still cringed when I think about it. nThe Fried chicken is pretty good and is the only saving grace.,1
"Ive been seeing Dr. Z for years and hes great. nI love that he only does GYN this means you always nget to see your doctor. I've been to many GYN that do OB nas well its very frustrating to have your MD be unavailable nfor various amounts of times b c of deliveries. You nnever have that with Dr. Z. Additionally his bedside manner is nTOPS. As long as he's practicing, i'll be there!",2
"We haven't had our carpets cleaned in 4 years and they looked horrible. The crew came out today and made them look so much better! They were quick and very, very courteous. We will definitely have them back again. but sooner this time! I definitely recommend the crew on truck 2128 Keith Ray. Thank you!",2
"I would give zero stars if I could. They appear to be defunct. They lost their BBB rating in July. I learned that at the same time that I learned that my timeshare company refused to transfer title to them because the timeshare vacation club will only sell to individuals, not companies. Did I ever hear back from WTA? Of course not. 3500 wasted.",1
"Good solid NY style pizza. Ordered over the phone for pickup, basic large cheese. Arrived 25 mins later, was greeted at the door and checked out immediately 15 and some change, pizza was ready and piping hot. Pizza tasted very good, authentic to NY taste, awesome NY crust, stretchy gooey yummy cheese, no complaints everyone loved it.",2
"Consider Chin Chin as a step up from P.F. Chang's, only with sushi. And that sushi was all right I noticed lots of the spicier rolls included the ever dreaded spicy mayo on them. Which, by the way, when did mayo on sushi become all the rage? It's gross! The server, however, was very accommodating and a sweetheart for breaking up checks for a group of 13.",1
I wouldn't return to this place. Even though our waiter was very nice our drinks were only refilled once! They no longer have the all you can eat prime rib either. My husband and I both got the prime rib 16.99 dinner and we never got our soup or salad. The prime rib wasn't very good and the kids Mac n cheese looked like it was just heated up. Not worth the price!,1
Their appetizers and drinks were awesome! We had the fried calamari and tomato fondue best we've ever had! Plus it was before 7 00pm so they were half off! The razz jito was amazing. Definitely recommend coming here plus you can't beat the view! Took a while for the bartender to warm up and become friendly.,2
We were pleased. The parking lot to store walk is nice. The outside of the store looked swank and very inviting. We got dried cherries and Lance crackers. As it turns out the Lance snack company started down here in Charlotte. We found this out from a retired Lance salesman who now sells luggage in Southpark Mall at the Tumi store.,2
"Stayed here with my family a while back. The standard rooms are by far the most spacious of any other major hotel in vegas. The bathrooms are very nice, but I remembered that they do not lock which may or may not have changed since I've been . The simulated outdoor mall is very cool if you have never been!",2
"This is one of the best places in Phoenix! Our crew has eaten their every other day. Try the 5 spice wow what good food. The place is a little small but the service is great and the food is delivered super fast. Their lunch specials are well priced and you just enough, well enough even for a fat guy who loves their food. Give it a try and you will not be disapointed.",2
"The lobster pot pie is amazing! Decor is very warm and modern, Wine selection was great. My wife and I REALLY enjoyed the soup we had forget the type and the whole experience was delicious. You don't need a long drawn out review.really. I've been back a few times and it's one of my favorite classy restaurants in Vegas. If you're still on the fence, believe me. it's exceptional",2
"It's been a while since I ate here but the food left a lasting impression. and NOT of the good kind. I don't remember what I had now but the food was MSG'tastic and left me super thirsty the rest of the evening and complimented me with slightly puffy eyes when I woke up the next day. Agree with Jason, will do in a pinch. but not a fan.",1
"food was good, but menu is really small, normal prices for vegas . if you cant get a table sit at the bar they have a full menu. portion size is small so sample the items and reorder what you like! the quesadilla was pretty good, taco were kinda wack. also really close to pure so good for a pre party snack",2
"We went to the Mesa location on Dobson last evening and for the first time, ever. the ribs were awful. They were overcooked, dry and honestly very tasteless. We didn't get there late or even during a busy time. Just 5 30 on a Sunday evening and nothing served was what we have become accustomed to getting at Dave's. Typically, we go to the Chandler location and we will continue that.",1
"There are nicer hotels for the same prices. I always thought Monte Carlo was higher class, UNTIL I STAYED THERE. Stained wrinkled carpets, chipped bathroom decor, etc. I stayed for the pools, but the lazy river is very small the wave pool gives off tiny waves, not even a tad fun. Not staying here again.",1
"Amazing! I am not usually a meat and potatoes person, but this place may have changed my mind. The crusty baguette with butter was a great starter, the filet merlot was mind blowingly good, the service was fast and very friendly despite the place being packed, and the ambiance was great. Also very reasonably priced for a Las Vegas steakhouse. Will be returning for sure next year.",2
"This is a pretty good Dollar Tree location. They have balloons, like most other locations, for special occasions. The aisles were clean and well stocked. I can tell that I liked it because I was only there for about 10 15 and I walked out with 10 worth of items. Just too easier to spend money there. Good selection of home, beauty and holiday merchandise as well.",2
"Ordered the special deal 40 two pizzas, 1 2 bucket wings, 1 2 bucket chicken strips because my friends didn't like the crawfish we ordered. The delivery guy came to our hotel in Rio in 20 mins. Lightning quick service and delicious food! I thought the pizza was good, but I loved the wings and strips more!",2
"SUPER COLD BEER! I like this place, the food is pretty good but the draft beer is excellent .a big glass served just the right amount of 'cold' . Nice bartenders too. . We visited in in the afternoon, no idea what the night life is like but its quiet and friendly with a 'Cheers' atmosphere during the day. My husband claims this is his new favorite bar in Vegas.",2
"I can't stand shopping here. Seriously! The check out line is ridiculous and with all the candy and beef jerky they force you to stand next to in hopes of an impulse buy, you'd THINK you'd be able to find grab and go items like jump drives. alas, not when I was there. Almost as ridiculous as the exchange return process. The staff we talked to seemed to lack product knowledge. I will NOT be back.",1
"We got there around 7pm, it was happy hour because of the football game, we had a table at the bar. We waited for about 8 minutes then were seated. We ate the traditional wings avocado egg rolls, can't go wrong with that, they were delicious. Apple Martini strawberry mojito were delicious. Taylor was our server, Nice server.",2
"Still no door on that toilet stall in the men's room? Sorry but people do like to poop in privacy. I'd hate this to be the reason why I am down rating this bar, but you'd think it'd be more of a priority for them to fix something as simple as a bathroom stall door. If you don't want to fix this, add a lock to the main door.",1
"I have been going to the Durango location for over a year now and I wouldn't trust any other place with my eyebrows! They come out perfect every single time. It's great that they opened up this new location on this side of town which is much closer to get to after work. Go here, you won't be disappointed!",2
AHHHHH MAZING! I called in for pick up and ordered a pasta dish with a pound of wings. The smell on the drive home tempted me so much. The food was great and the wings were perfection. Being from the east coast I know wings and these were amazing. Will definitely order from them again and hopefully stop by and hang out inside soon.,2
"I came here to get some scredrivers for my laptop, and decided to get the Homebase brand as it was a one use job. However the cheap price also meant the quality was bad, the screwdriver's head stripped instead of the screw! Luckily they gave me a refund and were apologetic about it. Avoid their brand!",1
Skylar was great he gets five stars! for my family who has worked in food industry love to see great customer service and Skylar has it in spades! there is no need to be fake just be yourself and be nice which Skylar has no problem with! will come back hoping that all employees have a similar work ethic!,2
Went in expecting good desserts and ate some of the best food we had in Vegas. Grilled chicken panini and turkey burger were wonderful. I could not wait to go to this restaurant for chocolate and by the time I finished our meal I was in the mood for cheese cake instead. It was very good. My husband's peanut butter sundae was delicious.,2
"Awesome after 10! REVERSE HAPPY HOUR. The food they serve for H H is HUGE portions. UFC is also shown here, no cover, but they kinda rape you on the drinks during the fight. 4.50 for a blue moon. BUT they also discount the burgers half price. Do the research. call or check the site or fb for specials, or sign up for the email list. I say, CHECK IT OUT!",2
"Excellent family owned restaurant. The service is always fast and friendly, the shop is quite clean, and for 5.55 5.95 depending on the dish you can get a huge portion for lunch including chow mein, fried rice, a meat dish, soup and a drink. Soup only included if you dine in. I've been here about once a week since they opened for my lunch break, and I've never left anything less than satisfied.",2
"Had to change my review after the last few times the hubby I came here. Sorry Pho Chandler, but your food has been disappointing me the past few times and I can't keep the high marks on here anymore. The pho has no flavor, and the other plates weren't anything to rave about either.except the bun rieu. One good dish. Good service. Two stars. ",1
"A little gem in NE Mesa. Fresh ingredients, including fresh mozzarella you rarely find a place that uses fresh Mozzarella . Service was top notch. We went on a Friday night with a large party and we were seated in less than 10 minutes with warm bread with olive oil and balsamic arrived before we could settle in. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",2
"The Combo Pan Roast is delicious! So is there clam chowder and oysters! The Chef is hilarious. he's got such a rough around the edge attitude. something like a Peter Luger, so do be put off right away. He's a great guy. Also the server is this sweet woman that makes up for his roughness. Awesome Oyster Bar team!",2
"Went with the wife for lunch on Thursday, not crowded at all. The waitress, Nina, was very prompt, courteous and professional. Had the Kickin' Shrimp starter and it was very good, the presentation might be a bit overboard. I had the 3 filet meal, all were done to perfection, as ordered, and the sauces were nice. Overall a very good experience, just short of outstanding.",2
"This is a pretty good Target. Lots of parking. Starbucks is also in this store. It has a full supply of food. A Pharmacy, and full electronic center. It is a very clean store they have great sales and a good stock. The Pharmacy has good hours but, the staff is not the friendliest. But, no big deal. All in all a good store not bad for any type of shopping.",2
"I'm from out of town. Looking to get great sushi for lunch. I went to this restaurant based on excellent yelp reviews. Boy.what a disappointment. Virtually no sushi selection for lunch. So if you're craving for a lunch sushi, go somewhere else. I ended up ordering the soft shell crab sandwich. Absolutely nothing to write home about.",1
Awful service! I took my mom to this place recently. We were seated promptly and that was the only prompt service we received after that. A server NEVER came to greet us or take our order. After about 15 min or so I approached the host who seated us if the waiter could please come by our table to take our order and we waited and waited.we eventually just left. Never again will I be back.,1
"This tiny place is a lot of fun. All the people who work there are awesome. I stopped by here a while ago and was so pleased. Their prices are reasonable and the variety of services that they offer is impressive. I'd much rather stop here than go to a hotel salon or spa for a nice up do or cut. Definitely, call for an appointment well ahead of time.",2
Techs don't know how to do any work on a car unless the computer tells them.no diagnostic skills at all.Last time my wife went down here to upgrade her car I detailed it beforehand and people there thought he car was for sale .their detail department sucks as well . nJust way too many complaints with mini's in general STAY AWAYY,1
"Wow! They were HOPPIN' and I needed in and out with a spa pedicure and gel manicure. How many times have you been someplace and they said ""no problem "" only to have you trapped with your feet in the spa for 20 minutes before they even got to you!? Not here! They said they could get it done in an hour and they did! And they did a fabulous job!",2
This is one of the best places to get a sandwich in Pittsburgh. Their menu is enourmous. They have to have over 4 dozen sandwiches alone. They also have wings and other delicious foods. Also they brew their own beer here. Fat Heads is a great place to go for a sports night in Pittsburgh or for just any regular night when you want to get some good food.,2
The room was nice but there are too many negatives. First the elevators to the room are way too far from front desk.i did not have anyone to help. There was no one at the front bell desk to help and the carpet made it very hard to take my case.the halls are noisy and the doors thin. The lines at coffee were very very long. Overall I would not recommend this place.,1
"Wasn't disappointed. The food was so so. I didn't have very high expectations as Brinker tends to deliver ""middle of the road "" experiences with most all of their endeavors. This was no exception. Not bad, not good.I can't really describe it well enough to do it justice. The food was bland and tasted like it came out of a can. Highly forgettable.",1
"After reading some of the reviews I thought this pizza joint would be a good choice, but was totally wrong. I ordered a 14 "" pizza with fresh tomatoes and a Greek salad. The pizza was extremely bland, absolutely no flavor! The salad was also bland and soggy so, I couldn't enjoy that either. Waste of twenty bucks! I would not recommend this place to anyone or ever come back.",1
"I was not impressed with this place much. It is nice that they offer tofu as an alternative to meat for add on's in your noodles. However, vegetarians beware they cook on the same surfaces, and the tofu took 10 minutes longer to arrive than my other friends' chicken dishes. The specials have decent prices, when you do a combo. Otherwise, I think this place is over priced and avoidable.",1
"false advertising and uninformed manangment. second time we have had a problem here and mgmt just doesnt care. came in to use coupon we received from BEAR REWARDS CLUB. They did not want to honor what is printed on coupon, plus they were out of 1 of 3 entrees u must purchase to get coupon promo. No substitutions so if they are out too bad. S.O.L. wish i could give negative stars.",1
"My friend and I were pretty disappointed. Everything sounded so great and unique, but my mussels with chorizo just tasted burnt.I'm not even sure how you would burn something like that, but I digress. I can't even remember what my friend ordered, but again, it was something that appealed to our foodie sense on paper, but was nothing too special in actuality. Too bad.",1
"So the atmosphere was great! I loved the service too! everything looked great to me until I saw some of the stupidest prices ever for lollipops. The macaroons were pretty well made but didn't taste that good to me. too hard and too over baked. Being a candy store, it wasn't all that to me as a I walked around. I wouldn't come back, but pretty decent experience!",1
"The food was extremely bland. I used a liberal helping of salt in the mushroom soup, and that improved the flavor a little bit. The cheese on the panini wasn't melted, and the chicken had no flavor. The bruschetta was overly flavored with garlic and syrupy balsamic vinegar, instead of being balanced. Even the soda tasted off.",1
"This is my go to place for a bottle of alcohol that I am gifting to someone, recommending someone to gift or celebrating with. The selection per square foot is quite impressive and the guys know their stuff quite well. They've tried a lot of what's in the store and when it comes to Tequila, have been the most helpful bunch every time I came in. Sidenote sometimes the music choice is questionable ",2
"If there's one thing I appreciate in a restaurant especially chains , is consistency. I always know what to expect at Outback. A decent cut of beef prepared well and reasonably priced. So, if it's a Thursday night and you just want a moderately priced meal with consistent quality, Outback is a viable option in any city.",2
"First, this place is located in a gas station. Not that it makes it bad. In fact, it makes it more appealing to me. Unfortunately the food was just meh. The shredded beef had very little flavor to it. The enchilada sauce also needed some spice. I guess if I was drunk off my rocker I might want everything on the menu. Being sober, on a Saturday around 1pm, this place definitely needed some help.",1
ALWAYS tons of friendly service whenever I walk into this location. You can become a Pro member for 14.99 which saves you money over time if you are a big user. Are you a big user? They have some selections for as cheap as 1 and they are pretty willing to look anything up for me even when I have come in there with some weird requests.,2
"This place is really cool. I can't say enough good stuff about it. I just started my first fish tank ever about three weeks ago. The staff answered all of my questions and provided a lot of guidance during the set up phase. So far, I have purchased four fish, some red legged hermit crabs, live rock and an anemone all of which are doing fantastic.",2
"We are traveling through enroute to Phoenix and are waiting out the storms. We decided to try something different and stopped here. We are NOT familiar with Korean cuisine, and decided to just go for it. Sure glad we did! My wife had the Kalbi rib plate and I had the stone bowl bi him bap. So good and we left pleasantly satisfied. Hope you will try it because I think you will really like it.",2
"I was visiting Las Vegas for Memorial Day Weekend came here for dinner on Saturday night to celebrate my birthday. We were a party of 12. Everything was great. The service was spot on even knew random facts about Tao NY vs Tao LV since our table was debating certain things. Food was spectacular, as always. I stuck to my usual Tao tini. Never fails.",2
"When I first moved to Charlotte, I was recommended to come here by a waitress at another burger restaurant in town. The appetizer selection is cheap and wide ranging, and the fried pickles were delicious if not a little spicy! . My boyfriend got the BBQ pork and thought the sandwich was great. The mac and cheese was amazing! Overall, I would come here again to try something different.",2
"Overpriced. It's in MGM, so of course it should be fancy and more expensive than everything else. But they try so hard to ""look "" fancy and upscale without having value to it. Go there if you don't mind paying double for just fancy American Asian food. Don't go there if you're looking for authentic Asian food.",1
I totally agree with these positive reviews old school Vegas style that us locals sometimes forget. It warm and inviting. And live music ya just never know who you'll bump into. And just wanted to suggest the pizza for tasty takeout far better than one of the pizza chains! Still quick and much better variety of toppings that are fresh not canned. And they love garlic like I LOVE garlic! Yum mm my!,2
"I had the spinach egg white omelette. So that seemed pretty simple, but I was surprised with some very dry chicken chunks in my omelette. The diced tomatoes helped make it a little more most, but other than that the dry chicken killed it for me. The hash browns were a tad bit too soggy and weren't very good. The burnt areas I was expecting to be crispy were just hard and chewy.",1
"I just love this place! It is the most awesome movie going experience! The food is always wonderful. I am partial to the Turkey Sliders, Sweet Potato Fries the Chinous Chicken Salad Rolls. My husband children love the Beef Sliders, Truffle Fries Flatbread Pizzas. Our service is consistently outstanding!Definitely try it out!",2
"Deduct. Apparently whatever they said they fixed last time I was here, they failed to fix. Either something broke again after they repaired it or they didn't fix it at all, or something. Chances are pretty good I'll be back here again, hopefully Doug will be back from vacation by then but for now, two stars.",1
Have no idea why this place has been given a bad rap. This is my new favorite place! Brittany B and Luis are the bomb ! The food rocked and the 10 beer flight special was awesome! nTwo dinners a flight of 8 tastings 2 12 o and two black velvety for 48 bucks is a fricken steal !' n Enjoy! We will be back nI only wish they cooked with canola oil as the vegetable oil contains soy.,2
"3 stars for the food, 2 for the service. Waitress was in attentive and so absent that we enlisted the busboy to get soy sauce, chopsticks and wine for us! When he brought the entrees out He even fixed our wobbly table something our waitress again failed to do. Great busboy btw Miso soup was not what we remembered but sushi and pad Thai were good.",1
"Don't waste your time or money! You will easily find something better. Overpriced. 11 for glass of beer. Poor and slow service. 15 20 minutes between each siting of our server. Nothing tasted fresh. Duck buns were too salty. nSliders buns were dry and beef was flavorless. nFish and chips was nothing special, have had much much better and paid far less.",1
"The brewery was great and the tour was very informative. Refreshing to see a company taking pride in their heritage and showcasing products that are made in Arizona! We sampled their bourbon, whiskey and gin, and all were great. Not only did we enjoy and buy, but will be referring family and friends!",2
"This is a great sub place if you like subs made with pre sliced, bucketed meat on crumbly, stale bread that disintegrates when touched by vinegar or tomatoes, or just by taking a bite. In a word DISGUSTING. Good service, though, can't complain about that. Sadly, that's not enough for me to give this place more than one star although it really deserves zero .",1
"I LOVE their granola and their nine grain bread! I no longer live in the area and now have their granola and bread shipped to me in Southern California. They also have the best cookies, pastries and I have enjoyed their sandwiches as well. Everyone is very friendly and helpful as well. I recommend this bakery highly!",2
"My girlfriend and I arrived to our AirBnB in Mile End only two hours before the symphony. Short on time, we hopped to this place and it was special. Fabulous, small plate menu with intuitive yet interesting flavor combinations, good prices for value, and wonderful, warm staff. Despite not having a reservation, we were served with grace and friendliness.",2
"Totally agree with M M R's review. Well done. I'll try a short and sweet version One man band Christopher does it all.and I mean all. While food is fantastic, the experience is what makes this a one of a kind place. Bring cash and your own wine. Don't be picky, let him bring you what he is making. You won't regret it.",2
"Save your money and choose Chima for a slightly higher price and a better experience. I had dinner at this place just last night. The trays at the salad bar were almost always empty and nobody was bringing more food. The meat wasn't that great, some cut was chewy and some other too dry. nDefinitively not worth it.",1
"If I could give negative stars, I would. The rooms were dirty and old. The customer service was like nothing I have ever encountered.I felt truly disrespected and didn't feel like I was cared for whatsoever. There are no jacuzzis. They charge awful resort fees and rooms are ridiculously overpriced. It was really not an enjoyable experience and I will NEVER stay here again.",1
"I've stayed at many Embassy Suites accross america and by far this is the worst. Really bad housekeeping service. will only service if you ask. Worst yeat, the tub allows sewer gases to enter the bathroom. Yeah real nice. and check the in room refridgerator before using it, ours was turned off. Overall this is a dump.",1
"Sugar Factory had a great ambience, the server was really friendly, funny and invited us back for breakfast. My boys and I all had steaks before a night out, I had the filet mignon medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and to my delight was tender and flavorful. Definitely worth trying at least once.",2
"Bland, greasy and uneventful. Had the flautas, got 3 greasy rolled tacos with a sprinkle of cheese, I had to pay extra for the guacamole and sour cream. Absolutely tasteless. Boyfriend ordered the tamale plate. Tamales were dry and over microwaved. Will not be coming here again that's for sure. Next time I'll have Taco Bell for ""authentic "" Mexican.",1
"This place is just ok. Just like all eateries in Vegas, it's overpriced for the did you get. One sandwich, one pasta plate and two kids meals was about 70. To make the visit worst our server seemed like he didn't want to be there or seemed annoyed at doing his job. My cup was empty for almost 15 minutes before he noticed. It was a Tuesday evening and not very busy. Will not return or recommend.",1
"Came here w a group of friends after dinner for dessert, all we ordered was ice cream and it took FOREVER for them to bring it out. I had the caramel sundae and it was really good. our server was really nice but it was ridiculous that we had to wait 30mins for ice cream. I would've left but it was my friends birthday and she really wanted to come here so I was being a good sport about it .",1
"I like everything about this place! From the food, drinks, staff and atmosphere I've never had any complaints. I'm a burger guy and the burgers here are better than most in Scottsdale. This is a tough location and several restaurants have failed here in the past few years. I see this concept staying here for a long time as it's always packed. Go check this place out!",2
"The novelty has worn off.too many locations.too meh of flavors. Portions still huge, but paying 14 for a giant pancake, eggs and some bacon is pretty deceiving. Service ok for a weekday. Im still trying to figure out WHY go in the Plaza. I mean friggin urine stained plaza. wow.somebody got paid big bucks. anyhow.its always worth trying once.Definitely need a menu upgrade.",1
"the food here is pretty good. i got the chicken and waffles and i must say that the portions are freaking huge at this place. when they bring out the food it is pretty intimidating. the plates are just overflowing with massive amount of food! just a heads up we took a cab to this location from the venetian, only to find out that they have one on the strip now!",2
"Don't waste your time with this location. I've been here 45 minutes, on a Driday late afternoon, and no one ha touched my car since it came out of the wash. 3 other cars have been driven up after mine that have gotten immediate attention. The employees that clean and dry the cars do nothing but complain about their job and and the tips they aren't getting. Wonder why?",1
We haven't been here in years and had a dinner Tuesday night and went back Sat it was that good. We eat at most the high end steakhouses in town but this place is really top notch! Def have to try the traditional favorites like the ribeye and porterhouse! All the sides and salads were huge and great!,2
I visited this in october of 2013 This is the worst Haunted attraction I have ever been to. The Gates of hell centers around the actors being able to abuse you. They seem to thrive knowing that its against the rules for you to hit back but they can do almost anything they want to you. Don't waste your money these people are cowards.,1
"MOzen was one of the highlights of our recent trip to Las Vegas. The Mandarin hotel is very peaceful and the ambiance of MOzen reflected that. The food was great the Sushi Sashimi were amazing, especially for a non Japanese restaurant. The spicy tuna roll was one of the best I've tasted. We had a few other dishes from the Bento special that were also quite good. Definitely recommend it!",2
"This is the worst delivery service I have ever had. Five of the last six Sundays have been missed. I keep calling because we like to get a Sunday paper, but feel this is a war between the delivery person and me. They must be trying to get me to cancel, and I probably will. I wish there were another paper to get out here in Cottonwood. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE experience!",1
"Holy candy Batman! My fiance and I went here for our candy buffet for our wedding. It wasn't as big as I thought it would be, but it was still a lot of candy. The prices are higher than I was hoping for as well. But you can find just about ANY type of candy ever made so that makes up for some of the prices.",2
"I had been wanting to try this place out for years but never made it a priority to get over there.now I know why. This place is average at best, the food is just not up to par on any level. The restaurant itself is beautiful but they need to put some serious tlc into the food. I guess it could be me since they've been around forever, but definitely not my cup of tea.",1
"A long time ago, I visited this same chain restaurant up in PA. It was fun, fast and wings are great. This restaurant , despite having the same name does not produce the same effect. I think the employees can try a little harder and inject some energy into the place. Look over at Twin Peaks. its bright, cheery, energetic.",1
"I love The Encore! I stay here a lot bc the casino is not over crowded and I can find tables with enough room to play with just my friends and I. That way you don't get some rookie playing 3rd base that doesn't know what to do. I love the rooms, linens, and service is great. Check out the amazing spa!",2
"Had the Coney dog Vienna hotdog with no bean chili n onions. The chili was good but not superb. nMaxwell Street Polish Sausage Vienna beef polish sausage grilled with spicy sport peppers, onions, mustard The sport peppers were really spicy! This is suppose to be voted best hot dog in Vegas. I beg to differ.",1
"I really am not a clothes shopper. But when I have to go and refresh my wardrobe, this is a good place. Great variety for all ages, well 30 and over. Very sophisticated styles. A bit on the pricey side. The sales accosiates are always very helpful. I'm not sure the reason why their sizes are set up differently but it works. I likey.",2
"Delicious pastrami sandwiches. Split one because they are huge. Had a nice large multiple ingredient salad that was rather tasteless but somehow very satisfying. Go figure. The knish was weird, not one seen in my New York days. I think the place is really cute and the service top notch. nCons pricey",2
"Nothing but the best unless its affordable and wallet friendly gas for my Berry VW . The locations are never really in the best of neighborhoods the odds are pretty good someone will ask if your interested or know someone who is interested in buying a washer but if you can get away with acting as if your a foreigner who speaks anything but English, no one will really bother you.",1
"If you're looking for floor jacks, don't waste your time here. The AC Delco 2T jacks are very poor quality and workmanship and the 2T jack I purchased was damaged. Got my money back OK, but that's it. Customer loyalty care was very lacking. Auto Zone has a much better, sturdier product with complete weldments, not just a few tack welds like the AC Delco",1
Even worse customer service than the Super Star car wash nearby and I didn't think that was possible. nSurley attitudes from the cashier to the line help. Final clean up guy walked over to the store without giving me my keys back and left the side window dirty.probably a feeble attempt to milk a tip out of me.not with service like this. Crappy job cleaning the car too.The owner should be ashamed!,1
"This place was not very comfortable feeling and seemed very restrictive. What was the point of putting on a paper gown and feeling like a doofus for not knowing how to put it on , then having it rip. Not a good experience. The Doc was knowledgable but demanding to the staff. Didn't really show respect for the rest of the staff.",1
"Not sure if I can attach a picture of my nails to this review. It looks like a DIY gone wrong. I don't think she knows how to do nails properly the daughter did my nails, can't speak on the mother . I guess it's partly my fault. I was going by all the positive reviews here, I didn't critique the nails properly. 2 stars for the cute salon. Other than that.",1
Consistantly prepared the same from one local restaurant to the next. I love the Walnut glazed prawns. But other dishes are also good. It's decent food with an Asian appeal. I stir clear of the dishes with a lot of dye in the sauce but that's usually only 2. It's freshly prepared about every 25 minutes in most cases and it's openuntil 10 30pm,2
"Solid 4 star stuff here, love the greek, not the best I ever had, but damn its so close I do it often due to convenience and service, price is good, not cheap, but thats why its better than a 3 star cheap gyro place, its got the specialties, like rolled grape leaves, the grilled meats, and cucumber sauces.get some.yum yum , get in my tum tum.mmmmm.licking chops thinking about it.slurp! solid",2
"Don't know why people like this place so much. Got the beef bowl that people were raving about on here. It came with some vegetables that were obviously low quality frozen ones. The beef was tender, and I don't mind that it was thin, but it was almost all fat. The miso soup tasted like water, none of the salty savory flavor that usually makes it good.",1
This club is massive and awesome. The energy here is the place to be for a good time. I have been here a couple times on Sunday Nights and what a difference it makes to have the outside pool area open at night. Make sure you get there to avoid waiting in line for hours. This is not New York or Miami where you go out at midnight to a club.better be there by 10pm.,2
"Endroit fort agr u00e9able et nourriture vraiment excellente, nous devrons tenter une nouvelle fois pour les autres plats qui semblaient d u00e9licieux aux tables voisines! Poulet tikka sinc u00e8rement d u00e9licieux et parfait dosage d' u00e9pices et ar u00f4mes. Le naan maison donnait envie d'en manger sans arr u00eat. Nous y retournerons assur u00e9ment!",2
"A very nice buffet! With 32 unique food stations, there's definitely something for everyone. That's what struck me most with this buffet. Sure you get your standards like prime rib and shrimp, but this buffet had some truly interesting and ethnic foods you'd never expect to see at buffets. It was also nice to see a good variety of vegetarian and vegan dishes including the desserts!",2
"Can't ask for anything more from a workout program. Great coaches and great people to work out with, plenty of classes every day. Crossfit can be intimidating if you're new, but they have an on ramp program to get you started and ease in to it. I'm in the best shape of my life, I can actually do pull ups!",2
"Music Together is great! The songs are really great and fun to sing, so much better than ""kids music. "" My kids both sing the songs at home from a young age. They love to jam with all the instruments in class. They also like pretending to sleep during the lullabies. Music together is a wonderful program for early music exposure!",2
"I had a laser hair removel treatment from Tisha Sudah here. She was AMAZING! nShe took her time and I had no pain or discomfort at all, unlike other places techs nI have gone to. I can't recommend her enough and the prices are very very reasonable. Beats those other places that advertise just Laser Hair Removal and then give you a quote that is out of this world crazy expensive! Thanks Tisha!",2
"I hadn't been to the climbing gym in years and it was time to start back. Went on Saturday and had a blast varied routes, fun bouldering, helpful staff and a few automatic belays in case your partner wants to check something else out while you go up a route. Seriously considering purchasing a membership. My forearms are still sore.",2
This was a really great show! Just went this weekend. Just about every seat in the house has a great view. I'm not sure I would want to be in the front row since it is REALLY close to the stage.and you may become part of the show if you are seated that close. I purchased discounted tickets through tix 4 tonight. More info on getting discount tickets on my site at http letsjetset.com,2
"I recently attended La Traviata here. Great show! The Benedum is a fantastic facility for the arts and a true asset to the Pittsburgh region. The only reason why it is not 5 stars, is they need to update the downstairs, and possibly the upstairs bathrooms. They were a little outdated and lacked the elegance of the rest of the facility. Nevertheless, a very fine theater.",2
This place is awesome. I don't know why haven't been here sooner. The food was delicious and the staff was very helpful. They let us sample all of the meat to decide which one we wanted. The restaurant itself is very clean. I love their theme! Very original. This place is authentic and trendy at the same time. I will be back for their tacos!,2
"I've been going here for almost 2 years. The staff here is very professional and I absolutely love Dr. James McAvoy. He is always concerned with my health and is willing to do anything in his power to help me feel better. Also, if you don't have insurance, this place is by far the cheapest you will pay out of pocket.",2
"Uncomfortable beds, tiny cramped rooms, and too far away from everything. I guess you can't beat the price, though hence the two stars. And the tourists are great to hustle at the poker table. Oh, and the blackjack dealers are all scantily dressed and dolled up so that's a plus if you like that sort of stuff.",1
"I think the sandwiches and salads I tried here were ok, but overpriced and with subpar rude service. Even with horrible service, they tacked on a service charge to the bill. I think this is the only place on my Canada trip that tacked on their own pre calculated service charge. I won't be back here.",1
"Saw this place on Triple D and decided to try it because I had just moved to the area. I had chicken enchiladas and it wasn't great. They were very bland and just not as good as other enchiladas I've had over the years. The rice and re fried beans were average. The prices were average but considering how bland the food was, still overpriced.",1
"What a fun little bakery. My husband has been in love with the Coco Bars since childhood I personally am not a fan, but that is ok . Any time I need to score brownie points with him, I stop in on my way home from work and grab a few. The cake bites they have are wonderful. We got a variety of them for our Easter Egg dyeing night with family and everyone loved them. The cupcakes are always good.",2
"These people are blithering idiots. My carrier consistently misdelivers our mail. I get my neighbor's mail and they get mine. And don't bother calling the 85021 station's number to complain, they do not answer. Just hung up after letting the number ring at least 25 times.nobody home. Yet another reason we need to privatize the USPS. Incompetent Nitwits!",1
"Nice shop but limited to one bike brand. I'm sure the staff must be nice but no one offered any greeting or assistance when I visited. I was only one of two customers in the store. I looked at bike carriers for about ten minutes, walked around checking things out for another few minutes but was never acknowledged. Seemed odd for a newer store.",1
"One of my two favorite Thai restaurants. Good food. It's a pretty big restaurant. Always few people, which I don't think is bad. It's pretty quiet. It's a friendly setting. Good food and nice people. I still like my Thai tea from my other favorite Thai restaurant better but they still have good Thai tea regardless. If I remember, their dessert was better though. ",2
"Capital is my go to Friday night spot! I love visiting Capital Brewery anytime of year. The beer garden is a great place to enjoy a cold brew, sunshine and live music in the summer time. In the winter the bier stube is cozy and fun. The staff is awesome and the beer is delicious. Plus you can bring your own snacks!",2
I would highly recommend this place. The food was delicious. We got the pork buns very good as was the Thai chicken. I ordered the pad Thai it was excellent. The staff was outstanding. Very attentive. Some of the best service. Only downside. Parking is very limited on the street but worth the walk to eat here.,2
"Love the grilled cheese basket w fries , concrete chocolate shake. Love the reycling in the restaurant. Love the cheese butter burger w onion rings . People in WI are so nice. Some of the tables were not cleaned yet, but it was after lunch rush, and there were plenty other to choose from. It is the only midwest fast food type burger joint we eat at. It is way better than fast food!",2
"I love this store and the owner. You have to get to know her. When you do, you realize she's very cool. Very no nonsense but in a good way. One nice thing is that I've got a big ass and everything has been pre stretched Ok seriously, this is a fun place to shop. They're very selective about the items they accept so I just don't have to worry. It's really such a smart way to shop.",2
"Tried a couple of their frozen coctails one night, not good. To be fair after trying the first one and gagging it back into the glass I asked the bartender to make it again with less sugar, he did, and it was still bad. I don't think it was the sugar that was the problem. If I'm there again I think I'll stick to beer.",1
My favorite place in Vegas! Delicious food. It would be perfect if it wasnt for the line to get in that took me 45 min. The food in there is totally worth the wait and the price. Make sure you go in with a empty stomach. I love the desserts in there. I bought the 39.99 buffet card deal for a bunch a buffets within a 24hr period. But it was like 24.00 to get in at lunch time until 3 30 pm. Enjoy,2
"Love this restaurant! The good is always tasty and the atmosphere is always fun! On Saturday nights they have live music and dancing. Great to participate in or just as background noise. The BEST part is their mojitos! They're huge, strong and inexpensive! My only complaint is there's always a long wait.",2
"Came here for dinner b c we arrived at the hotel late and we were too lazy to go anywhere else. Mushroom Swiss burger This was actually pretty decent but a tad on the small side. Fish Sandwich Ugh. This was virtually inedible. The fish was fried waay past crispy, bordering on rock hard. Disgusting. Overall, don't come here unless you really have no other place to eat.",1
"The delivery guy got lost on the way to our place but he was friendly. Mostly, the pizza arrived very late, they got our order wrong mozzarella cheese sticks instead of cheesy bread that we ordered , and the pizza dough was undercooked at the bottom, tasted very bad at the top of the crust, and the cheese was incredibly soupy oily. Thank you but no thank you.",1
"We had dinner plans and found out our show was within the hour. We told out waiter who was so helpful and we only got to try the appetizers! Our waiter was very helpful in suggesting the appetizers! Would come back and try the main dishes. We had fresh oysters, Terrine de Foie GRAS de Canard, Escargot a la bouguignonne and Confit de Canard! It was awesome!",2
I normally come here at least once a month and have never been disappointed. The Brooklyn specialty pizza is my favorite. I also like the garlic knots. They have a great happy hour special where any pizza of 50 off Mon Thu dine in only . It used to be available for carry out also but they just changed it to dine in only.,2
This was recommended by a friend and was fantastic service wonderful food presentation was crazy! This could be my new local favorite hangout! I would definitely recommend this restaurant! I will be back for certain! Pork ribs special for lunch. are you freaking kidding me? Absolutely off of the charts! Only my second visit but definitely a favorite that I would recommend!,2
This was the worst Thai food I've ever eaten. Not to mention the worst service. The only reason I tried this place was because the Thai restaurant across the street was close that day. Wish I would have mcdonalds instead of this crap. Priced way to high too. Just a really bad choice if you eat here.,1
"Dined here twice during our stay at Aliante. Both experiences were great. We had great service. And the food was very good. We tried the crab cakes not easy to find good crab cakes they were fantastic, full of crab not bread filler. The cioppino was also very good plenty for 2 people to share. Love the bread basket of sourdough pretzel bread with whipped butter. And 8 10 for good, strong drinks.",2
"Schedule an appointment with William, he was great. Upon leaving a woman attempted to sell me a membership. Still not sure of the benefits. She would waive the 40.00 application fee ? Really excessive and not required a most places . Even with a membership the price of an 80 minute deep tissue massage is the same as the standard price at say a locally run spa.",1
"I heard this place closed, that is unfortunate. It was actually still open in June 2011 when I passed by the Wynn Hotel. It must have closed up shop right after that. The night I pass through was a Thursday and it honestly seemed really empty even for 11pm or 12 midnight. Sorry to see this go, it was a pretty chill place. Yeah, how could they not keep this gem of a place.",2
"I've been volunteering hanging with the cats recently. The staff is so friendly they want the best for all of these precious animals. The cages are always clean and always have fresh food, water, treats, a blanket, toys. This is a great company I'm so happy to volunteer and spend time with the kitties",2
"My last time here and I DO mean last time , they had lost control of their own establishment. They couldn't get you a table or tell you how long it would be. You were supposed to wade into the crowd and commandeer your own table. And then, best of luck getting service. If this is your only option for a night out, stay home. I hope it let's me vote no stars. One star is WAY too many.",1
"If you're going to buy something here make sure you're absolutely going to keep it, or if you're buying a gift for someone from here, make sure they're actually going to like it! Because under NO circumstances will they accept returns! Even though I bought a 100 item, they would not return it. And we very rude about it.",1
"Found a long black hair in my burger. The buns were cold the meat patty was overcooked asked for medium and very thin. The side salad was decent, the tea tasted like crap and the food took foreeeeever to come. The waitress shifted from friendly to rude and then back I was thinking about asking her if she had a evil twin sister or something.",1
"Great Corner Suite! Love that its non gaming when my kids come. They love the monorail! For a quiet, non gaming, no smoky air experience, after a fuight in town this hits the spot. Used the washer and dryer, the Kitchen and separate bedroom and auto shades are all super chic. Self parking is not available only valet. Here we go again.",2
I moved to Las Vegas from mesquite and shortly after so did my nail tech from mesquite. Small world! NINI is amazing! She has been doing my nails for like 7 years! She is great I love her wish she was closer to where I live but I drive clear across town for her. Business location is in a very nice summerlin area the rest of staff very nice. No complaints,2
"Service was wonderful. My lemoncello torte used a lot of imitation lemon, reminded me of lemon pledge. Deep dish cookie was much better. We ordered the baked ziti pizza and added the seasoned crispy chicken. Toppings were super yummy. My knife couldn't cut thru the crust, I guess you would describe it as chewy? I'd get the same pizza but maybe try different crust.",2
"Called on a Tuesday to inquire about replacement sheet of glass for my TEC grill. The gentleman who answered the phone said it would cost 149, take about 3 weeks, and he wanted 50 down to place the order. Then I called TEC directly. TEC said it would be 70 and I'd get it by the end of the week. It arrived today, Friday. Talk about price gouging!",1
"This is by far my favorite thai place in Vegas! The food is fresh, the staff is so friendly, and the prices are great. I especially enjoy their vegan options and the fact that you can chose your spice level on any dish you order. This is a great little place on Freemont that I would highly recommend to both tourists and locals.",2
"For food truck Ok tasting gourmet, non traditional tacos. WAY overpriced. I paid 15 for 2 tacos after tip and was left hungry. I will never eat here again, knowing that a ton of taquerias have opened, serving amazing mexican tacos for a fraction of the price. Very disappointing, but not surprising considering it's a Montreal food truck .",1
It's been a long time like 5 years since I visited Hush Puppies and I could recall if I liked the food. So when I moved back to Las Vegas and wanted some fish I drove thru and ordered the catfish sandwich. I had to wait 15 for my order and the food was cold the fish was so think all I tasted was the bread it was in between. Very disappointing for the price.,1
"Took my girlfriend in to buy a bike here. While the purchase was smooth, we also decided to upgrade some of the components while we were there. Both items were paid for but had to be ordered. The guys ended up only delivering on one of the items and then gave us the run around every time we called on the second item. Won't be back in.",1
"I went here for lunch a week ago. I think the food was good but the portions were tiny. They don't serve lunch on the weekends. There were four of us, we ordered three entrees. The bill was 80 at lunch! The service just sucked! I was like scared to ask for something. Anyways, I don't think i'll ever go again.",1
We went to Spring Training a few weeks ago. Of course it was hot and we had to go into the Gelato Spot. The gelato was great the only thing is for the price we paid for a small cup of gelato wasn't so great. I could have brought a gallon. n But we were there for Spring Training and we hadn't been to Scottsdale before so it was worth it.,2
"A small Burger joint with real good 100 beef burgers 1 4 lb patties , all beef dogs n service. Beats all mainstream, fast food burger joints. The wait of everything being made fresh to order is worth the wait, trust me, I ordered their special burger, thought they forget about me while waiting inside to eat but when the burger arrived, erything that occurred while waiting was forgotten.",2
"I've been looking for other movie theaters other than brenden theaters. I'm glad I found Rave! This place is pretty massive and such a convenient location! Plenty of seats, movie tickets priced reasonably and very clean. Townsquare itself is appealing and I love the modern aesthetics. Shopping malls should look more like townsquare! Ok, so Rave is awesome and I will be coming back again!",2
"Last night, four of us had a fabulous dinner. The staff were friendly and attentive. Even the chef visited our table to make sure we enjoyed our meal. Food was delicious and prompt. I had the Butternut squash ravioli which was wonderful. My friends had sea bass and salmon and there was no food left in the table. We'll definitely be back.",2
"Food was okay and service was WEIRD! We had the most awkward server. It was embarrassing! However, the Tom yum was pretty good and so were the pumpkin and panang curries. We noticed that the rice is really sticky, probably because they used sticky rice instead of jasmine rice. Pretty strange for Thai food. But not bad with curry on top. We would come here again. but only with a groupon.",1
"Excellent down home cooking. As a business traveler several clients recommended this as a must visit. Perfect combination of down home feel, reasonable price and excellent quality mixed with neighborhood friendly service. Even though the shrimp and grits had an unfamiliar flavor combination, I still returned the next night to eat there again. Top five to visit.",2
"I love their pizza, but I tried to call to pick up a pizza tonight and was put on hold. For 5 minutes! I thought they forgot about me, so I called back and was asked to hold again. I told them I wanted to order a pizza and was already on hold for 5 minutes. I was told, ""well, could you just hold for a couple of minutes longer? "" and was promptly put on hold again. I gave up. They got issues . . .",1
"This is my favorite RA. The best time to go is for the lunch specials or happy hour! Otherwise I feel that it can be a bit pricey! On Tuesdays they have the by one get one lunch special if you are apart of the ""hooked up "" email list. My favorite lunch special is the salmon bento box! Service is usually pretty good! Chill atmosphere.",2
My husband and I went on a date here Atmosphere was fantastic the food was not. We ordered the calamari appetizer that was so so. I had the osso bucco he had lasagna. Both tasted like they had been previously cooked and then microwaved. Would be a great place to go for drinks but we won't be eating here again. It was too expensive for the food to taste like that.,1
"So it sounds weird to love a Walgreens, but this location is set up in a way that makes me partial to it compared to other locations. Their wine section is absolutely amazing and has fuew labels at great prices often has awesome specials. They also have a great selection of liquor like Pinnacle Vodka whipped cream flavors etc.",2
"I'm really surprised out how mediocre this buffet was given the reviews on the internet. We waited about an hour, but once we got in we found the dining area to be only at about 75 capacity. The food was standard buffet fare. The crab legs were salty and old tasting. And the waiter never returned to refill our cokes. A better buffet can be found at the Rio.",1
"A group of us tried this restaurant because we were ""craving "" Mexican food. We were not disappointed, the service was good and we got a great table on their outside deck. They also have great salsa, the first time I had heated salsa and it was great. Also I would recommend anything on their taco and enchiladas menu.",2
This was my first time eating at a Joe's Crab Shack. We went for dinner at about 5 30 and it wasn't too crowded. The service was great and our waitress was friendly and on the money. I had the Samual Adams boil and it was great! I loved the atmosphere and casual feel of the place. Will definitely eat there again!,2
"Cute, homey, tasty food, toys for kids, gluten free bread, home brewed kombucha. Managed to feed a collection of adults, including two gluten free people and one lactose intolerant and soy allergic person, plus entertain multiple young children. Nice work! Now just make some tasty gluten free scones and I'll love you forever and give you all the stars I can.",2
"Pretty much the best gym there is in the Las Vegas area. Top notch locker room, equipment, amenities, and service. Multiple basketball courts that can be used for other activities as well. Racquetball courts. Indoor and outdoor pools. For those with kids, it has child care services. It's open 24 7. If it's within your budget and conveniently located this is the gym to join.",2
While inexpensive this was the ABSOLUTE WORST buffet I have been to in Las Vegas. The variety was there but there wasn't much flavor to any of the dishes. The service wasn't great and about 20 minutes after leaving the buffet it was clear that something didn't agree with my stomach because I immediately ran to the bathroom and got sick. I will definitely not be returning to this buffet.,1
"They are only good for washing you car and THATS IT! Just paid 40 to have my headlights restored but now it has more scratches on it than before. I asked the guy over to redo it 4 times and he finally said thats the best he can do. They only use one rough sand paper and no fine sanding to sand out the fine scratches. Sh tty est piece of so called ""professional "" work I've seen. NEVER AGAIN!",1
"The service was very good. He was very attentive and kind. It was a little hot but hey, we're in Vegas! The carne Asada fries were yummy. They were the thick steak fries my fave. Carne Asada is fresh and the salsa bar is small but pleasing. I give it four stars because my sister thought her carne Asada burrito tasted kinda fishy maybe it was the rice? Definitely give it a try ",2
"I've been to many Arby's and this was by far this worst I've ever been to. I ordered through the drive thru and elected to wait for a chicken sandwich to be cooked however, it was in fact not cooked all the way through and I nearly puked biting into the middle of raw chicken. The fries were the burnt leftovers sitting for hours I'm sure. I will never be returning to this location.",1
"I had lunch here today and it was nothing special. I had their dim sum and I think the the taste was just mediocre. The quality of the food was alright as it didn't taste bad, but was not super tasty as well. I only waited for about for about 5 minutes for my table. The food came about relatively quick, but I didn't see the waiter come by again until I finished my meal.",1
"Being from New York I am very selective about my pizza. This place is up there with quality as I had their mac n' cheese pizza and it was outstanding. The service is fast, friendly and the venue has plenty of room to sit. They were also opened on Easter Sunday which I thought was fantastic and I would recommend this place to anyone.",2
"WOW this place is incredible. It is huge, well lit, organized and everything is used and reasonably priced. Saw this place on Yelp and had to check it out. They advertise as an entertainment exchange store. They take trades on books, magazines, movies, CDs, games. I have never seen a used place this well, great. Wish we had something comparable in Denver.",2
"sometimes has trouble with appointments but i feel like that's a front office secretary thing more. She is an amazing amazing psychologist. she's helped me with transgendered issues and helped me deal with my marriage as well. amazing person, she's in it to help. not for the money. i've never had a serious problem with no shows. all it took was a phonecall and reschedule. sometimes stuff happens.",2
I love this place! All the doors were open and the breeze flowing through the restaurant was perfect! I sat at the bar and the bartender recommended the perfect dinner for me. It started with artichokes portabella mushroom bruschetta . It was deli sh and only 5. Dinner was seared sea scallops with mushroom risotto and arugula topped it off. Outstanding!,2
"Ridiculously expensive but great quality luggage. Had to get a specific piece for my boss, and when I called to check availability I was able to do everything via phone and email. Saved me a trip to caesars AND no sales tax since it was shipped out of state. Yay! Manny and Di made it a super easy transaction",2
"I love this Indian restaurant! I've been to many across Central Illinois and have even been to India. Their chicken mahkani is great and can be ordered at several levels of spicyness. Naan is great, too. The service has always been excellent. They even made lamb jalfrenzi for me even though it wasn't on the menu. In addition, their prices are some if not the most affordable in town!",2
"We stopped in for dinner at the bar and were pretty underwhelmed. It's an off the beaten path location, but seems to be a favorite of locals which I don't really understand. There are much better food options in the area. It seems like a much older crowd and the food was pretty blah. I had the halibut on orzo and fish was overcooked and the orzo was so oily.",1
"I like this place. Big salad with your meal with a couple of kabobs and rice. The bread is good as well. Food tastes good, feels healthy, and very fresh. I always get to 2 kabob special. Leave full n happy. Not a very heavy meal, but filling. That good kind of full were you ate well, ate enough, and feel good about what you ate.",2
"I would concur with many others. This is a hidden gem. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced. Mussels were truly outstanding 5 star . Also, a superior and diverse wine list, most by the glass. It is a traditional French bistro. If you have any interest in that style, definitely try it out. You will enjoy.",2
"I went here for my annual Thanksgiving breakfast and will never be back. Aside from the hostess, who I had grown to ""know "" over my dinging with them, the customer service was an embarrassment. I am usually one to consider the ""whys "" not this time. Something about this place has changed and not in a good way.",1
"Let's see, tables and slots did not pay out. Cocktail waitresses did not make rounds at the slots and it took me 20 minutes to get my drink at the tables after I ordered. Speaking of the drinks, I don't believe it had a lick of alcohol in them and I was tipping well. I only gave 2 stars due to their friendly staff and decent decor.",1
"I love the location, and the finds are great. I have found everything from Hats to Mavi Jeans and dress shoes are great prices. Staff is friendly, atmosphere is upbeat. If you love true quality clothing and shoes but don't want to pay come in here. Also the sales associate sold me on their rewards debit card. Merchandise displayed is very neat and kept. Love ya Nordstrom Rack!",2
"Lisa was ridiculously friendly, giant burgers cut them in half to eat , quiet atmosphere outside, clean accessible restrooms, and great beer. I'll DEFINITELY be back here. The only downside is that if you're in a wheelchair you have to eat outside because they're booths have a bar under them blocking access, and their tables were all allocated for private parties.",2
"I don't care much for this place. Long lines, slow service, expensive prices, people cluttering around the entryway smoking and eating yogurt because there's no outdoor seating for this store The only outdoor seating I see is Chipotle's stuff . It's very frustrating. I'd much rather go up the street to U Swirl.",1
So I'm pretty particular about my boba drinks you can call me a smoothie snob which is why I think this place rocks. This is the only boba spot I've been to that doesn't make artificial tasting drinks. I appreciate that I can get real fruit smoothies here with great quality. You'd never expect it but this is place has the best smoothies in Vegas.,2
"I will be back! Excellent service, excellent food. Had the Tom Yum soup and the Spicy Chicken. I did order both spicy, next time I will order medium. I would order either again and am looking forward to trying thier other dishes. Siri Thai is added to my favorites for dining. Prices here are fair and service is quick.",2
"This store has treated me so well since April of 2013, I buy a lot of suits shirts and they have always been a pleasure to deal with. Jason is really nice and the rest of the staff has always been easy to deal with and very kind. I highly recommend this store, and definitely getting your suits tailored here as well!",2
"I've only been here once but thoroughly unimpressed. When we walked in the bartender was outside smoking and told us she would ""be right in. "" We waited several minutes before she returned, seeming annoyed. She then left once again to go smoke. After the first pitcher we asked to order another and she audibly signed",1
"My boyfriend and I live in Vegas and went here for the first time last month, and it was a big waste of money. This place is only successful because of where it is located and because it has a celebrity's name in the title. Portions are small, food is bland. I wouldn't recommended this place. Spend your hard earned money, on somewhere else.",1
"Walmart just runs a gong show everyday. The aisles are always blocked and all the workers are always in a bad mood, I don't blame them though I would be too if I was treated as poorly as they are. Walmart is good for if you need something when your drunk at like 3 in the morning and everything else is closed.",1
"Nope. This is overpriced nonsense. I hate to start out the review with a statement so crass, but truly, its location allows this establishment to charge a great deal of money for a meal that is not really that good. Once you get past the pot of liquid and the skewer, think about what you're eating, and then look at the bill. These things do NOT add up.",1
"I have used My Pet Nannie multiple times and they are the best! Professional, trustworthy and very easy to work with! I even have used them with very short notice without a problem and my pup always has a great time with them! Also, they leave you a little report card describing what happened on their visits, which is great! Highly, highly recommend My Pet Nannie!",2
"Very small cafe style spot in a strip mall. Habanero's offers amazingly good authentic food that you would pay double for down the street. They have everything from breakfast burritos to unique daily specials. All are served with several delicious salsas. If your not trying to impress a date, then try this for an affordable, casual, neighborhood experience.",2
"I have heard good things about this place but I can't get a table in less than 2 hours I have tried 3 times . The fact that they dont take reservations is highly annoying, I have made my last attempt to eat here, very very very frustrating. Unless you want to spend your entire night waiting for a glorified big mac, I say skip down to Tessaro's where youll get a seat in a much timelier fashion.",1
My family and I had breakfast there and it was ok. The food was not very hot because it was served on cold plates. The pancakes did not taste like they were homemade. My coffee was hot. The service was ok but could have been better. Overall if this was not so close to our hotel I don't think I would go back.,1
Terrible. Had the car for eight hours. Couldn't find the key when we got here luckily we brought an extra. Was supposed to be a detail and wax for 90 . It still had bugs on the front end and the interior was not clean either. There were swirl marks from the buffer that you could see once the car was in the sunlight. Total lack of attention to detail.,1
"I've been to 40 countries and 29 states but this is my favorite bar! Mainly because of Amy, the best bartender I have met. It started when I celebrated my birthday there a couple of years ago, she was so sweet. Food is great, drinks are great and the atmosphere is awesome. It makes me travel from Sweden just to go there.",2
Check all your items before you pay. I have gotten many items back with wrinkles ironed into them. nThe only reason I take my shirts here is to have them pressed as I HATE ironing. nIf I have to double check the work of a professional service then they are not worth my time. BOTTOM LINE Find another cleaner!,1
I made a Yelp account to write this review. I have NEVER had such poor service. I don't know how this restaurant survives. I've been twice and when I was there the waiter and cook acted annoyed that I existed. Most of the meal they whispered and looked at me. The sushi is decent. But don't expect to have a good meal due to lack of service.,1
"I came in late one night sat at the bar. It took forever for the bartender to take my order, after 30 minuets I headed out the door, never got my food. really poor service this time. Next Visit nWay to pick up the ball run with it Candice! Good job, fast service really good food. Thanks again Andy for reaching out.",2
"My boyfriend and I live pretty close to Komol so we go here a lot. The servers are nice, food is great, and the lunch specials are super affordable. They have great soy shrimp and the vegetarian appetizer sampler is awesome! Tempura spinach, yes please! They aren't very consistent with the spicy levels but other than that, I love this place!",2
"Some servers here are pretty awful and need to take a lesson on 1 writing down correct orders and 2 keeping track of what food's been brought out and what hasn't and 3 not arguing with customers when errors are pointed out. Given that, food is still good. Will see how Hot and Juicy in Tempe compares.",2
"The girl who did my nails was nice but the owner is a jerk! I brought my daughter with me and they are not kid friendly at all. I wanted to like this place! They asked if I wanted to get my nails done and I asked my daughter and they said rudely ""no just you "" why they didn't want to help us I have no idea. Never again will I go back to this place",1
"I have always had great service here,even when it's busy.The food is excellent but expensive.They do have an awesome happy hour which makes up for the costly prices.Great selection of beers and awesome martinis make coming here worth it. They also have a pretty cool patio for when the weather is nice.i definately reccomend the yard house.",2
"Usually here for the occasional diet Coke and occasionally an ice cream cone for the dogs, but since sometime around 7 00 a.m. this morning the place is gone completely demolished. Now why does that make me all happy and giddy with joy? I imagine it's simply because it's too much of a temptation. nWell I don't know this to be a fact but I'm fairly certain they'll be back.",1
"I saw a band named ""Captured by Robots "" play here a couple years ago. It was a fantastic and terrifying show at the same time. The crowd here is all over the place the band seems to determine the crowds sanity level. Highly recommended if there is a band playing here that you want to see. Without the music this is just another dive bar with the music, it is perfect.",2
"Not impressed. The service was very intermittent. Was not told upfront that they were out of certain ingredients.No pulled pork, no chili and after placing an order for breaded chicken was later told they were out of that too. No utensils were brought to the table, waitress was M.I.A. Nearly the entire time.",1
Was just in and the place is a dump. Not really sure how the pick with thy buy. But I brought in 5 pair of lucky brand jeans all in perfect condition. Worn only a Handful of times. They declined. With the crap they sell in there they clearly have no rhyme or reason to the garbage they have. I would never go back in there.,1
"Excellent, made from scratch, chickeoodle soup. It is so hard to find soup like this. Next time, I will try the soup of the day. They ran out of Pea soup last time, which looked excellent. My friends raved about the eggplant soup. The restaurant is a simple diner look and a little dated. The main reason I go there is for the great, homemade soup.",2
Solid com tam broken rice . That's all I really need to say. They have just about every variation of broken rice platter you can think of and its served as it should be. The shredded pork is very good as well as the egg cakes and egg rolls. They do NOT have pho. But they do have a wide variety of bun dishes that are not as good as the com tam dishes. Prices are great.,2
"We have been having our dental work done at aliante dental for over 5 years and we recommend everyone we see that Dr. David Chung and his staff are very professional, compassionate and his pricing is always fair. Dr. Chung has also taken the time to give me a phone call in the evening to check on how I am feeling after a difficult procedure to make sure I am not experiencing any pain. Andy Noel",2
I am a horrible picky eater which is my fault! I use to go in all the time to eat there chicken pesto sandwich. It was my birthday and my friends asked where I wanted to go and I picked there so I can have my favorite sandwich. It was very disappointing to find out they no longer made it! On my birthday so sad we had to leave.,1
"Outstanding quality and range of products served by a friendly, efficient and enthusiastic staff. It is a small location that gets noisy as it fills up. The beer stands with the very best I've tried. Highly recommend if you are a beer lover and visiting Montr u00e9al. The food was excellent as well, featuring a small menu of sandwiches, burgers, pizza and more.",2
"Good place to go if you a fans of Irish type of beer and or any types of dark thick beer. I can't really handle the dark beer so I tend to not go there if I don't have to. They do charge covers to get in, so be sure to shell some more of your beer money for that, usually 10 and a long line especially on the weekends. I would rather save my money for somewhere else.",1
"I used to frequent this place a lot, but staff changes and the quality of the clothes is well.bad. First of, rude AF staff. If you don't know how to treat customers, you shouldn't be working at a customer service oriented job. And second of all, they use to have such nice quality clothes. The materials aren't so great anymore and it's become overpriced.",1
"I've been a member for a month now, and I guess I'm able to get my workout done. I do find myself annoyed how cramped it can get by the weights. Like most of the reviews mentioned some of the equipment is older, but it suffices. I worked out at the LA Fitness on 3rd Bell and it was AMAZING! It was so clean, nice, and new tv's on EVERY cardio machine. When I came back to this location I felt BLAH.",1
"The meal was a lot smaller than the picture in the menu. The service was slow every time I come here, I don't know why. It wasn't that crowded and I saw enough waiters and waitresses. If you don't use coupon there are 2 more menus to choose from, it's weird. I probably won't come here again, I like Wildflower bread company better.",1
"Will never do business with Surprise ford. Found a F150 on car gurus for 37,956. Sent multiple emails about the truck and decided to go test drive it. I decided to go talk price and when they came out the price had gone from the 37,956 to 44,000. They didnt know how the truck was listed for 37,956. I got up and left. I dont have time to play games.",1
"Wonderful service! Ben at the front desk was great! He tried very hard to accommodate my self and 2 daughters. We got a really nice suite and the driver sheen I think was also wonderful. He was prompt , friendly and helpful. The bar staff was also friendly. I think the rooms were spacious and well equipped . For the price I say it was amazing. The friendly service alone was worth it.",2
"Bar area was great, nice beer selection. as long as you didn't want to get seated. After being told we were ""next "" watched 3 couples get seated before the 2 of us. No acknowledgement that we waited much longer than our hour wait time. When we final got seated it seemed an inconvenience. We then left without dinner.",1
"Absolutely LOVE going for this Sushi. Fresh Wasabi HAS to be the Best Sushi in Phoenix, hands down. Every time I visit, I always start with the Lobster Bake Roll. Oh My, So GOOD. The staff is always friendly ready to answer any questions you may have. The atmosphere is very pleasant. I never have to yell to talk to my co sushi lovers like some other sushi joints around town.",2
"What's wrong with those f doctors. bunch of primadonnas. they just can't take a call for one question. They simply ask you to take an appointment. oh! sure doc, let me pay 15 copay and have you bill my insurance for one visit so I can ask you if I can stop taking the pills you prescribed and that are giving me constant headaches. won't even mention her name. They don't care. except about money.",1
"I am a fan of their products except the HOUSEPLANTS. I bought all my houseplants from IKEA on the same day and now I am battling the flying knat like insects that live and breed in the soil. Lovely to look at, cheap to buy but if you do, be sure to stop by the Home Depot and get some insecticide and treat them in your yard or garage before bringing them into your home.",2
"I can't rate this place low enough. I was a good customer of the old saltys. The old place was decent food, cheap drinks and good service. This new Saltys is terrible! I ordered a Coors light draft and it was 4.50. What the heck? My PBR was a small can and 3 bucks. I'm pretty sure this will be my last time here. Good bye Saltys and good luck staying open with all these bad reviews.",1
"This is my new favorite restaurant I only wish I could afford to eat here more often! Food was perfect, wine selection was amazing, the waiter was attentive and super nice, and the atmosphere can't be beat quiet, romantic, beautiful . Go Here! I still love Zebra and Barrington's, but Fig Tree definitely beats them out.",2
Ewww! Totally grossed out. I can't believe what I saw! Never eat here again. I noticed as I was going up to get more food employees eating behind the food bars and you won't believe this by also spotted a RAT underneath a booth bench. Scared the living day lights out of me. Ran out of the restaurant as fast as I could. Will never ever go back.,1
"Don't get me wrong, I think the food tastes great.Weeelllll, except for the Okami brand like sushi. But all the cooked food was great. Especially the steamed sea bass. On flavor, this place should be 4 star. But when you're flushing said food down the caballero's ivory throne less than 5 minutes after you tap out, you have to wonder about stuff.",1
This bar is absolutely amazing. The vintage library look is unique and alot of thought was clearly put in the design. The drinks are reasonably priced and the staff is super friendly. I have allready been twice and had a great time. Unlike other downtown lounges this one is smoke free! ! You can't go wrong if you want a great place to meet up with friends and have a few drinnks,2
"Eh, howzit. Dis is where the locals like stay. Okay, that is my attempt of typing out pigeon. By locals, I mean people visiting from hawaii. I like to play table games here. Never very crowded. What really brings me back here is the Hawaiian food! I've never stayed at this hotel as it's located downtown away from the strip, but it's worth a visit.",2
"Food is wildly mediocre bordering terrible. Ordered the casa roll not sure if its an off night but it was terrible. Texture, flavor all around consistency was terrible. Tried to send it back order something else the older Asian man said ""this is what you ordered, the ing. are on the menu. "" Would not take it back. Terrible ""Customer Service! "" Nothing was that great! I will NEVER EVER return!",1
This place was packed on a holiday Monday at 2pm! Had a short 10 min wait. Ordered pi u00f1a agua fresca to share. Awesome! Had the shrimp app with the absolute best tasting ceviche I have ever had! We ordered the beef king tacos and huaraches. Alot of awesome food! nFriendly atmosphere. Mexican music. Best bang for the buck! Can't wait to bring my parents! nAutentico!,2
"Great Ambiance in here. The prices arent bad, and they serve absinthe. People of all walks come in here, and really isnt a dress code besides no hats. Music is playing but you can still talk to the people in your party. If this place was back in the 70's im sure coke would be on the table in lines. LOL just saying.",2
"I would have probably rated this place 3 stars or higher in the past, but the place still smells like smoke, years after the statewide no smoking in restaurants ban. Lunch dishes tend to be very small. One piece of fish on a fish and chips, etc. The wait staff is friendly and there is plenty of seating.",1
I've been going to Elaine for 5 years now. Not only is she a great nail technician she is also a hard worker and a perfectionist and so is her Husband. I think they are a great team. My finger was hurt last year and she has done wonders with my nails to make it look the same as the others. Just want to say thank you Elaine,2
"Steven was great guiding us through our first home buying experience. He really took the time to make sure we understood everything, even when we asked the same thing 12 times! Also when things weren't going right, he was quick to get them fixed. Although I didn't love his choice of mortgage lender, I'd recommend Steven to anyone for buying a home! Thanks Steven!",2
Terrible! Worst Mexican in all of charlotte and the worst mex I've ever had. Went with a large group and everyone sent there did back and half of them ended up sick. The guacamole was brown and the tacos were disgusting. I wouldn't rec this place to anyone. Please do yourself a favor and don't eat here!,1
"Great place to sit at the bar and enjoy some tasty food and a beer while watching a Suns game. Great atmosphere, super friendly servers as well as patrons and good food. I tried the sliders and the hummus both were delicious! The only negative about this place is the valet.feels weird to valet your car at a sports bar.",2
Decided to come by around 8pm with Ex military uncle and his buddy. As soon as we walked in got greeted and were helped quickly. My uncle got 2 batteries and some juice and I got some juice as well. Their line of juices are amazing and the employees were amazing people they are helpful and they offered me a cotton change for my little boy dropper. Deffinately going back and I'm from the eastside,2
"I went to Table 34 for lunch on a few occasions after meetings or with coworkers. Every time I was impressed. I had a variety of items and each time everything was delicious. The servers are very friendly and food comes out in a timely manner. I would say the pricing is a little high on some of the items, but overall it is worth it!",2
"A coworker just brought these in today as a treat for the rest of us I have never had these donuts before. They are amazing! I will definitely be driving out of my way to partake in the doughy deliciousness again. I can't say anything about the physical restaurant or anything, because I wasn't there. but I can vouch for the product. Absolutely delicious!",2
"Worst restaurant service experience I have had in Charlotte. Went there for brunch and service was terrible. My omelet was a lovely shade of brown. Couldn't even complain, because server was no where to be found. Took over an hour to wait for our checks after we finished eating. Manager was unapologetic and rude as well. Never going there again.",1
"Great wee place opposite the Pear Tree Inn that serves up a tasty and quick meal in a box. I can't comment on the entire menu, but I loved the red Thai curry with egg noodles, chicken and extra garlic and chillies. You build the meal as you want it, then all your choices are tossed into a hot wok and served to your table or as take away . Sometimes the simplest things work best.",2
"We went here after a less desirable dinner nearby, Thankfully, the Milkshake Factory did not disappoint. Although on the expensive side, it is well worth it. The family ordered a Carrot Cake shake and Chocolate Banana shake! Great choices! The menu is deep and the rest of the store is overwhelming! Definitely recommend!",2
"The newly renovated Portrait Gallery is definitely worth a visit. The permanent collection is full of portraits from Scottish history. There's usually one or two rotating exhibitions on as well, so there's always something new to see. Admission is free although some of the temporary exhibitions are not .",2
"Being a long time devotee of the Gelato Spot, I never gave this place a shot. I must admit, the Marscapone gelato was very good. I probably won't switch from Gelato Spot because parking is so much more convenient at 32nd Camelback. However, the next time I am out for a walk in the area or am in the mood for a sweet treat after dinner at Postino or LGO, I will definitely pop in.",2
"Ate there months ago will NEVER go back. I don't know how this place is still open. I found pieces of a roach in their sesame nut desert. They didn't even apologize. Oh and yup they made me pay. The ladies room was disgusting. In all fairness I ate here sometime last year, started this review, but never finished it. Diana L. glad to hear they're closed. They should stay closed.",1
"This is by far the best urgent care I've been to! The staff is ALWAYS great and friendly. The waiting room is clean and wait times aren't too bad either. My favorite part is the fact that they have their own ""mini "" pharmacy for affordable prices, so instead of waiting at Walgreen's for your prescription you get it right there after you see the doctor!",2
This circle k sucks. They always have some bullshit reason to be closed late night posted on the locked front door. And it so conveniently happens to be when I get off work at 2am. Clerks are slow and will chat with the person in front of you when there's a huge line behind them. Avoid circle k and go to QT,1
Phyllis was very nasty on the phone. I was a potential customer until she was rude and seemed to be too bothered to do an item check. Not only will I not go there but I won't recommend that anyone does. If you are rude over the phone how can I trust you to be nice in person or for that matter trust you with my vision!,1
Helloooo my new favorite place! Stopped by here for a quick lunch and didn't think I would be so happy and satisfied. I got the avocado veggie burger and i don't even remember chewing it was so good i couldn't eat fast enough. The fries were a bit on the salty side but for 2 you get a lot of fries. I really like this place and I want to try every burger veggie possible.,2
"I'm not impressed with the pastries, bread, food or coffee here. Everything is way overpriced and nothing too special. I ordered an omelet and got a thin egg tortilla filled with cold veggies and un melted cheese! I still go here sometimes when Aroma is full. They do have free wi fi and the space is clean and comfortable.",1
"OK but not definitely worth returning. The broth did not have the home made authentic taste to it. Feels Fake. It is given as diluted a lot. The chilli paste on the table is too oily. nIn a strip mall in the Hispanic, less nicer part of town. Cost of medium is 8.50.Small portion size. for the price.",1
"I heard really good things about this place.only problem it's all the way in NYC.Fortunately, I was able to find this place in Vegas so I had to try it. OMG it's hellla bomb. I guess NY style pizza really lives up to it's reputation it's huge. We also got a large salad to split between 3 girls and still had some left over. I really wish I could eat grimaldi's everyday.FML",2
I had a nice early dinner with my family while we were on our vacation 7 11 . The staff was very nice and the owner came out to talk to me and my family. Definitely had a small family atmosphere but it was early. The view was great and our server gave her individual attention to everyone of my kids. Definitely a place to come back to and a staple on all of my future trips to Sedona.,2
"You can expect decent service only until the sale is made. When it comes to delivery, they suck! They said the range we wanted was not in stock and assured it will be delivered within 10 days to two weeks. It's almost a month out and there is no one to give a proper response. The switch board operator hardly waits to hear you out before transferring to some unrelated department like repairs .",1
"I was expecting a cute cozy cafe with fresh gluten free yummies, but that is not what this is. It's just a bunch of frozen baked goods. I bought the bagels and almost fell over when my total for 4 bagels was over 8. Hoping that they would be amazing, I tried them today and they were terrible. Too squishy and salty.",1
"This was the first and last time that I will go to Red Robin. The waitress, named Katie, was terrible. The restaurant was only half full, but she took forever to come to our table. I ordered a black and blue burger. It was just awful and terribly over priced, even the tea tasted bad, I actually left thirsty. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
"Wow, you will not believe how great this place is. I'm from Milwaukee and transplanted 3 years ago. Point is I missed how great their sub's are. The Cheese steak was actually better than I remember. I cannot wait to get a tuna and a BLT the tri fecta of the menu for me. nPlus they have Spreckers root beer on Tap. Yes on Tap!",2
"The go to place for entertaining guests. great for a meal with family and friends. The open space is very welcoming with tasteful furnishing. Far above average fare for a chain, you get your money's worth in both food and atmosphere combined with wonderful service. The place fits well in the Town Square environment.",2
"I love La Bocca, but the management has changed for the worse in my opinion. I adore the same wait staff, they are so attentive, and friendly. I usually go during the lunch hour, but I don't like that the manager is now the host and we can't seat ourselves. I have introduced myself to the manager, but every time I go and I go at least three times a week he doesn't seem to remember who I am.",1
I was really disappointed with my foods and services! We came in at 1 50 pm and waited for 15 mins just to order our drinks! And we didn't get our food till 1 hour later.and waited for 40mins for him to stop by so I can request for our check! This is ridiculous! If I can give negative stars! I would!,1
"Gotta love discount! nBrought my Honda Accord in here this past week with a flat tire, and they were able to get me a new tire pretty quickly, as well as set me up with a new spare! Discount Tire must literally be the only company in existence where claiming The word 'discount' doesn't make them shiesters.",2
"Went in with high hopes. Very clean especially considering other salons close by. However after half a day polish already off of two toes! 20 plus years of pedicures and never had polish come off that quick. Too bad, been in PGH 4 years and I can't find a GOOD salon. Miss my NYC neighborhood salons! Cheap and GOOD! I called to see if they'd fix, let's see if I can get a call back.",1
This was the worst sandwich I have had in a very long time. I got a reuben sandwich which should be pretty typical. The meat was lunch meat and not grilled. The bread was toasted? WT? Who does that? Apparently Sub Station II! Will not be going back here anytime soon. what a sorry excuse for a sandwich place.,1
"The dark red decor had me at hello. nThe service was great. The bartender was not only friendly, but made sure my drink was full. nThe games were decent, but the on the casino floor are better than in this bar. nIf you are at the Red Rock Casino, Lucky Bar is a nice way to pass some time and lounge.",2
"We decided on this place because they had 4 out of 5 stars! What we experienced was a 2 star restaurant at most. Very slow service with no one really in the restaurant. Food took a long time to come out, silverware had food stuck on them, soup salad came out wrong. The only good part was the homemade potato chips were good.",1
"Solid. Pretty good but not mind blowing. My favorite items were the beet salad so Californian of me and the macaroons. Hey it's a buffet, so I had to get one of each flavor. Lots of variety like you would get from most buffets in Vegas. This one has a lot of Asian options, maybe because I was there around Chinese New Year?! Definitely something for everyone!",2
"I think this is more Peruvian comfort food. Having enjoyed the food in Peru, I anticipated a visit to this recommended restaurant. Even went with a Native who did all the ordering. I would not expect anyone to know American food if I served them Mac Cheese. This was not what I remembered from my trip, but as a tourist there I must have eaten differently than locals.",1
"Yawn. Ieed of a facelift and some sprucing up. Cheap, for sure, but you get what you pay for. And for just a small percentage more you can get much more for your buck. If you've got kids, it's probably ok. But the amenities, food, drinks, rooms are all pretty boring if you're going to vegas for fun and glitz and glamour.",1
"All these great reviews, we were anxious to try it. Got there about 5 45pm on a Friday night. We get in the door and are greeted promptly more like blocked from walking in more than 2 feet with ""I'm sorry there's a private party tonight. "" After silent staring at each other a bit, we turned to leave. REALLY? On a Friday night? We won't be back.",1
"Edgar was more worried about my slightly torn 20 bill and proceeded to give me a nasty look and said ""oh 1 torn 20 bill huh? "" Then proceeded to tape it in front of me like I had commuted a monitory crime, then reluctantly proceeded to get a cup of coffee an breakfast sandwich. Guess he just needs to be on a vacation and have someone return the favor to appreciate being on the other side.",1
"My favorite things at Sbarros is the stromboli with extra sauce. It's not that flavorful but I think it offers the best value and makes me really full. The prices here are ridiculous compared to mall prices. 6.99 for a stromboli, really guys?!? I guess its just that this one was located in the Charlotte Airport so the rent is higher than usual.",1
"I do not enjoy places or things that smell of toilets and strip clubs. UNLESS it is a toilet or a strip club. which even then i do not enjoy. next time I'll pass. However. given the choice of hanging here or minus 5 degrees at mandalay bay. I'll take my chances in downtown las vegas because minus 5 degrees sucks hairy, sweaty, donkey balls.",1
"Service at the Persian Room was excellent. They have a very large menu specializing in various kabobs, but there are seafood and vegetarian options as well. There dolmeh and hummus is fantastic, and the traditional flatbread with basil, butter and onion was so delicious! A great place for large parties.",2
"Grande vari u00e9t u00e9 de th u00e9 u00e0 d u00e9couvrir! Moi qui suis fan du th u00e9 vert, j'y trouve mon compte. Je repars du magasin avec diverses sortes de th u00e9s. Des petits sachets pour en goutter plusieurs fruit u00e9s, fleur u00e9s, etc. ! nVous pouvez u00e9galement repartir avec un th u00e9 en main, infus u00e9 sur place, comme vous sortiriez d'un Starbucks avec un caf u00e9 en main.",2
"Bryan was great. We recently remodeled our kitchen and needed a good but not too pricey electrician. Bryan worked us into his schedule and offered thoughtful tips about layout and placement of lights, switches, the whole deal. His price was reasonable and he was very reliable. Called when he was running late and was on time if he didn't call. Perfect!",2
The quality of the food at the buffet is really poor. The only food that is good is the salad bar and the gelato. The teriyaki or shoyu chicken is always over cooked and very dry and the roast beef is always tough. I would recommend going to the Santa Fe Station buffet. The food there is ten times better and it's for the same price.,1
I totally agree with Adam R. My father in law used to be a mechanic here they pay commission only and if they got someone like Adam they would loosen his oil bolt or slightly turn the distributor or something else evil. Some Arabs own the place and encourage sutting corners so find a reliable guy don't go because its cheap. You will get what you pay for,1
"A local out enjoying the strip while the tourists are home, purposely stopped by Monte Carlo for a Nutella latte at Sambalatte it's 5 21 pm and they're CLOSED! WTH? How does a coffee cafe on the strip in Las Vegas ever close? Meanwhile, Starbucks has TWO 2 locations around the MC and both are open and have customers. Sambalatte offers way better product a shame they don't like to stay open.",1
I have bought 2 cars from World Motors. They have been very professional and very helpful during and AFTER the sale. Gino is great to work with. When I need another car I will be back. Both times my car was super clean and in the showroom for instructions on the car. both were convertibles and I needed instruction on them.,2
"Hmm, I guess I was too small potatoes for them. nShaun came out to measure 4 windows and 1 slider. nI was interested in cellular shades panel blinds and 1 motorized treatment. He said because of the 4th of July weekend coming up that he would have to get back to me with pricing. Never heard from them again Home Depot's window service got the business instead .",1
"This is my favortie Fry's store to shop in. The employees here are very friendly and will actually look at you, greet you, and smile. Lance has always been very helpful whenever I am looking for something in the store. One of the cashiers I believe his name is Angel? is always very nice and helpful.",2
Amazingly great bundt cakes. The kid helping me knew EVERYTHING about the bundt cake business. I'm impressed. So much so I let him upsell me to buy 2 to take home after sampling of course . They deliver and have a rewards program as well as a free bundett for your bday if you sign up to their newsletter. I will be back.,2
"About the best you can expect from a fast food restaurant. I had to grab a quick dinner here with a couple co workers before heading to a work function. It was clean, the food was good for fast food, and the staff was friendly and quick. Let me pre solve a mystery for you, though the straws are hidden in a cutout in the walls on the opposite side of the counter from the drink lids. You're welcome.",2
I have ordred take out quite a few times from here. The bartenders are always friendly. I usually order the Kobe Big Sky Burger with Steak Fries. They have great Ranch dressing for the fries so I can't forget to mention that. On several occasions I have enjoyed the Cajun Steak Pasta Blackened steak medallions in a spicy tomato cream sauce. Never dined here but To Go orders have been a breeze.,2
"Going off past reviews, it's seems they've gotten their act together. For a place the size of Madison, this was very decent Dim Sum with a good selection of stuff and a lot of promise. I consider myself a competent judge of dim sum having eaten all over this country and in other countries. Wish this place had been around when I first came here. I think I may become a regular!",2
"Pleasantly surprised. The suite looks more like a condo than a hotel room. I'm glad I didn't pay attention to any reviews or my husband and I would've missed out. Loved the jacuzzi, double shower , even the living area. Everything felt very "" home like "" . The linen was trendy and the bed was comfy. The gym was also clean and well maintained. We will definitely stay here again.",2
"Service was poor today. Asked the server for crayons for my daughter, which never arrived. Server seemed disconnected and food took longer than usual to arrive at table. Had no silverware when my salad arrived. Requested vinegar twice. Manager did come to check on this one through the meal because I think he knew we were frustrated, but by then we were over everything. Please get it together.",1
"Pete was professional, fast and a pleasure to deal with. He charged me a fair price and did outstanding work on some closet repair I needed done. I am truly confused by any negative reviews I see because not only was Pete professional, but very personable as well. He obviously cares about his work and I would not hesitate at all to use his services again for future projects.",2
As other reviewers have noted there is a big difference between the renovated rooms and the old renovated rooms at this hotel. Although apparently the walls are paper thin in both. This is not a great hotel but the water pressure in the showers impressed me enough to offer 2 stars. Seriously it was like a pressure washer.,1
"Great facility and great location. I was here for a swim after a 50 miles bike ride last Saturday. Surprisingly, it wasn't busy at all on a Saturday afternoon. No family swim just lap swim. I could have stayed longer but their hours on Saturday is from 12 noon to 4 pm only. If you are looking for a nice and quiet indoor swimming pool in Vegas, come to this place!",2
We went to the drive thru. We ordered 4 drinks. It took them 10 mins. for the drinks. They got 3 wrong and forgot about the other one. As we were waiting we saw the whip cream thing HANGING OFF THE TRASH CAN! After 20 mins they finally got our order right. After all of this they did not even say sorry.,1
"No longer my favorite Starbucks. Horrible customer service. Received bad service twice in 4 days. Apparently it is so hard to smile. Girl at the drive through really did not seem to care. Decided to go inside for once and they forgot my drink. The girl did not write it down, and seemed more interested in talking with her friend then helping me. Don't see myself coming back.",1
"We attended lunch for Restaurant Week. For the price, I thought it was an excellent bargain. The salad was fresh and perfectly dressed. The steak frites were nicely cooked and a good sized portion. The dessert was a sorbet that was a bit of a throw away, but not that big a deal. For a bit of an added bargain, go during happy hour and get 2 for 1 wine.",2
"I wish there were more traditional donut shops in my area. These cotton candy treats are good but they all taste the same after a while. They are sticky, spongy and just dissolve on impact. Once in a while I want my cake donut and a normal maple bar served in a place where seniors are reading the newspaper.",1
"I ordered 16 "" pizza with 20 wings with an order of calamari . The pizza it self was OK not the greatest pizza i ever had and the 20 wings were boneless and were an extra charge for the bone in, the wings could not be split ex 10 hot 10 medium there is an extra charge for that too. The Calamari was bleh really chewy and the batter was salty. i will not be returning",1
"Tacos El Gordo , the best mexican tacos in Las Vegas. A plus if your visiting out of town and craving tacos and or quesadillas . My favorite are the steak quesadillas with the homemade flor tortillas by the way they also have corn tortillas. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming . This place is always packed and a line out the door . It gets and deserves 5 stars. Keep up the good job",2
"Most of the time, this walmart isn't too busy, but when it is, the lines are longgggg. The Sonic here is so so. It could be way better. nThe Salon not too good for nails, but the eyebrow lady is pretty okay and super cheap! nThe Deli the prepared foods could be way way better fresher. if Walmart doesn't have it, go drop by target",2
"For Arizona, this is not a half bad Chicago style food. Although one of the employees said that they use Vienna beef hotdogs, I dont believe him. It didn't taste like 'em. The Italian beef combo was pretty true to the OG however, the hot giardiniera was extremely salty. The chili cheese Cheap, salty, greasy, fried, processed ""cheese "", spicy chili basically how it should taste bomb.",2
"We stayed at the Aria. We were hungry when we arrived so we stayed ""in house "" for dinner rather than venturing out on the strip. This was not one of our better dining experiences in Vegas. Chewy calamari. Tasteless Caesar salad. Duck confit risotto was pretty good, but not great. Disappointing for the price. Far too many other choices in Vegas to bother with something this mediocre.",1
"A TCBY for the 21st century? The McDonald's of Fro Yo? The place is similar to Razzy Fresh Razzy is locally owned and operated, not an international franchise. Tutti is slicker, of course thousands have been paid to designers and marketers. But the fro yo is more or less the same, and the toppings just as good and fresh. I prefer to go local.",1
came in to do a smog since the regular place I go to is closed on Sundays. Was told that there will be 2cars a head of me so I decided to wait. Next thing it was 2more cars ahead of me. Yeah probably will never come back. No customer service at all. Not to mention that it took one of the guys litterraly 5mins to do an oil change. Hmmmmmm?,1
"This is a local hangout for the best neo JAPANESE can buy! Try and order the Omakasa! It's something like a 7 course meal literally called ""chef's choice "". The food is AMAZING! The staff is friendly and attentive. Even if fish is not your thing, go and try their steaks. Finally, don't forget to order their choc soufflet with homemade green tea icecream. YK",2
The 48oz margaritas are to die for! I bought the take home goblet and came back for refills a few times with some friends. They were strong but mixed well so they were delicious! The food was great and not too expensive but the atmosphere is the best part. The bartenders and servers are exceptional and are genuinely friendly.,2
"Writing this review while still sitting in the restaurant. Hunan beef was very good, spicy enough to cause some sniffles but still enjoyable to eat. And the crab rangoon called crab angels here were great and I eat those everywhere I can get them. Prices are reasonable and service was quick but it was not that busy when I got here either.",2
Between 1 3 went in. Really good food miso soup normally really salty however this was really good. Large lunch portions. Wanting to try sushi looks amazing. Had udooodle dish was really great. I would like to give 5 star review however server was in front of the entrance with phone and had to waive someone for check.,2
"The place was pretty cool to check out. It's not somewhere I would go very often as it's definitely a cool 1 time novelty, but wouldn't be against taking people who haven't been before. It's cool seeing the bar, ice sculptures and all the seats be made completely out of ice and the mixed drinks were pretty good though a bit small.",2
"1 Star for the cute ""snooty "" girl with the side ponytail who seated us. 2 stars for the waiter who sort of took our order. 5 stars for the roaming waitress who noticed we were out of water after waiter and ponytail girl left us hanging for quite awhile. The food was okay but not worth the uppity overall attitude.the restaurant itself is very cool.too bad they screwed it up with idiot staff!",1
"Hubby and I saw Gabriel Iglesias and it was AWESOME. had to wait in line in the heat, but other than that we had a great. We didn't eat, had the 2 drink minimum and then hubby had a few more. Bart tab wan't bad for 2 people and alcohol. I think they have taken into account the bad reviews and have fixed a lot of problems. YEA!",2
"Had four different tacos last night. You aren't going for the decor or ambiance.service was good, but the food was meh.land taco was very good.soft shell crab was pretty good. Skirt steak was ok.hard to differentiate flavors and items sort of tasted the same.same flavor profiles.went to Jacks across the street to wash it all down!",1
"There are a thousand better Thousand Trails RV parks than this one. We stay in the Get a way and it was surprisingly not up to par. The bathroom rug, shook out into tub cause i just had a feeling, and ""ugh! "" Super gross dirt, hair, who knows what! No soap or other amenities in bathroom, curtains tired looking and the park overall is jam packed. Just so you know.",1
"Maybe I'm spoiled being from California, but this wasn't great Tex Mexican food. The service was fast and nice, but my chips were stale and the black bean burger was quite bland and underwhelming. I also loathe any sit down restaurant that charges for chips and salsa.it's seriously absurd. In summary bland and way overpriced.",1
"Not really a great pub but more like a bro sports bar with a dark wood interior and some UK beers on tap. If you like loud 90s extreme radio, you'll feel comfy here. Lots of Nickleback and Pearl Jam. The food here is expensive and not even good quality with British food how is that even possible? . Oh well.",1
I tanned at this place for about a month however was not impressed by the staff. They were very rude and they didn't seem to care about their customers. One time I walked in when two employers were there and they chatted among themselves for a good minute before getting to me. Only thing I can say is that the beds were clean. There is better places then this one.,1
Very over priced for generic mexican food. The salsa is like seasoned ketchup. I asked for something spicier and got roasted habenero. It wasn't bad. The margaritas were decent. nWe had two burrito dinners and a fajita plate. Also 1 beer and 1 margarita. The bill was 66. 45 would be more than fair for what we got. The service was good. ,1
"What a joke.the only part of the club that was open on Thurs was the outdoor bar. Too bad the temp was 105. Not too nice when there is nowhere to sit either. I'll be skipping this lame club next time we go to Vegas. The bartender declined our card as well, found out later that nothing was wrong with it. Scared us into thinking that the bank had frozen our account due to fraud.",1
Great sports bar to go to if you are in Scottsdale area especially during Spring Training! All the waitresses are hot and very personable as well.Food isn't anything special but what sports bar does?! Only a few blocks away from Scottsdale Stadium so great place to go and celebrate after the Giants win!,2
"Nowhere can you find outlets to charge phones or tablets! What's up with that? This place is 15 years behind in making improvements that passengers need and want. I found one ""charging station "" that made it look like they were doing us a favor by providing a dozen outlets in one very small area. It's still fun to come here, but abandon hope ye who are low on battery life.",1
"Shortly after this was posted, the owner contacted me. He offered to, at his own expense, tow my vehicle into his shop and make some repairs. At his word this time, he did just that and my car is now actually running. While I wish this would have been resolved immediately, as soon as the issue arose, I do appreciate that the owner ultimately made the extra effort.",1
"This place looks the part. Great decor. The food is Macayo's level. Just add 2 4 per item. A Chimichanga for 14! Even with rice and beans.I can get a number of Chimicangas for 8 9 that taste at least as good as this one. I don't really know the draw to this place. The staff is really cool, its just too expensive! Especially for Mexican!",1
"Love it! nwe stay at harrahs all the time and for this is one of the many reasons. nit IS pricey. nBUT so goood. nchampagne brunch is amazing. nthe waitress' are my favorites on the strip, nThe selection is beyond me nbe prepared to leave here at least 15 20 pounds heavier. nim actually craving there breakfest right now.",2
"Food was only so so. Ordered eggs Benedict and the eggs were cold when my plate came to me. My bacon was floppy, but I figured it was because it had sat under my eggs for a while. Not just me though, my niece had bacon beside her french toast and it was just as badly done. She loves the stuff but wouldn't touch it. Waitress took my plate without asking me if I was done yet. I wasn't. ",1
"Probably the worst corned beef hash skillet I've ever had. Sounded great but when it came out it was all potatoes and seriously about a two bites of corned beef. Server asked if everything was ok, I asked if that's normally the amount of corned beef, she says yeah and walks away knowing I'm obviously not happy. Over all not a good experience.",1
"Like others have said about V bar, it is really chill. The music is good and the place is small enough you can see everyone around you. If you want to dance, you can. We had a few tables and it is a good place just to hang out with your friends and not worry about skanky bitches bumping into you and spilling their drinks on you. I would def go back.",2
"The Christmas Goose is a lovely little shop on the westside. I love the employees who are all very endearing. They have a great selection of civil war, reproduction, and country fabric. My only dislike is the lack of unique, bright colored fabric, but that is my personal taste. It is worth a drive across town.",2
"Terrible. Have never had slower service. Waitier was not friendly, did not greet us when he approached the table. He would just walk up to the table and stand waiting for us to initiate the dialogue. The waiter served our 20 salad on hot plates. Ruining our salad. Dinner was not served until 35 minutes after we had finished salad. Will not be back. If you get Kyle as your server. RUN",1
"Stopped here for lunch after a visit to Red Rock Canyon. The menu offered a wide selection, and I chose shrimp cocktail and a Tuscan chicken salad. Everything was delicious. Red Rock Casino is off the strip and on this weekday it was very quiet and I was able to relax after my desert experience. I would definitely stop there again to catch a bite ",2
"The hostesses on St. Patrick's Day were rude little girls. I would not return based on their attitudes seeing as how they were my first impression of the restaurant and how they treat people. This was my first and last visit. With so much competition in that area, there are plenty of other places to choose from where I am sure are more welcoming and less snotty.",1
"This is a great place if you love good beer. And life is too short to drink bad beer! They have a great selection of bottles that you can purchase and drink in the bar, or take out in a mixed 6 pack. They also have a rotating menu of beer on draft. This is not a bud light drinker's bar. They have great pizzas also.",2
"Came here solely for the iced milk boba with pudding house special because I heard it's comparable or similar to that of Half Half's iced milk drink in Cali. This place only made me crave half half more it's not that great. The drink took forever to make, and when I got it, I was sorely disappointed.",1
"Grazie's has some of the best pizza in the valley. It is located in Verrado up against White Tank Mountain. Great for people watching and AWESOME pizzas.If your from the east side and you like pizza and would like to kill some time or travel to the west side to check us out, Grazie's would be a nice lunch dinner place for you.",2
I had the pasta weesie and my husband had like a sample platter of chicken dishes both of the dishes were good and we had a really nice waitress Christianne H. We also had the spicy lentil soup at the recommendation of our waitress. I would come back again and I would recommend it as a good date night or just because night out.,2
Service and drinks where phenomenal but the food left me wanting more. Not all bad but expected more. Nothing a 100 memorable good or bad and thats the hardest part to swallow. Hopefully my next visit the food meets the standard shown in the service. I gave 4 stars because the service was just that good.,2
"Saw them on Food Network and was determined to go while on vacation in Las Vegas. Was fantastic! Our vacationing group enjoyed it so much we went 2 times in the 4 days that we were in Vegas. I personally had the banana cream dipped french toast and I really, really enjoyed it. BTW, every cab driver knows that when you say Imperial Palace that you're going to Hash House A Go Go! ",2
Service was good. I just didn't care for the ramen or food. Very bland to me. Maybe it's just hard for me to come here when I've been to fuji ichiban in Guam! Anyways I love the whole concept. It's pretty cool with anime everywhere and waiters are dressed up but probably would never go here unless friends wanted to go.,1
"Clearvision called me and apologized for the error and that they themselves did not know that patients could not use more than one rebate. Because they felt responsible for giving me incorrect information, in good faith they offered to reimburse me the 50 I was unable to get. This was excellent follow up and what customer service is all about! Thank you!",2
"I really dig their 8th Street Ale, and the food here is great! Got the calamari last night and then some pork adobado. Both were home runs! Loved the sauces for the calamari, which came in sticks cut from a calamari steak rather than the typical rings and tentacles. This place is a bit of a drive for me, but is well worth it every time!",2
"I will start with the good. The staff on the phone is very nice and the delivery guys are fast and courteous. The dumplings were great and that is my test of good Chinese food. Other than that I don't have much good to say. The food was bland, bland, bland and given the other reviews I was surprised. Overall not terrible, but I probably won't be back",1
"The Potted Donkey sets itself apart by offering more than the standard Sonoran food. You might like the grilled salmon tostada or the cornmeal crusted mahi mahi. My favorite is the Pork Antojito. The sangria is excellent, and the fried icecream is unique. Atmosphere and service are great. Unfortunately they won't get five stars as long as they make you pay for the chips and salsa.",2
"Pushy annoying sales people. Overpirced Prices more than doubled in last year. Unprofessional employees rude, arrogant and disrespectful attitude. I would not buy from them if they were the only choice! HIgh turn over of staff says a lot about the company. Too many choices out there to waste your time with this racket.",1
This place is awesome. the staff is really cool and helpful. they let u do everything by your self while a range master watches. they have a wide range of guns to rent from hand guns to machine guns. while i was there i rented a SAW M249 and was bad ass. the prices are reasonable. bring your family for a all around good time. A must visit when coming to Vegas,2
"I loved the atmosphere of this place. On top of that the food was amazing. I got the Buttermilk Pancakes with strawberries and a side of eggs. The pancakes were absolutely delicious and gigantic, and I couldn't finish them despite wanting to. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who loves breakfast food!",2
"If I could give 0 stars I would! These people are the worst!. My Staff hired this rag tag crew and I wish I could of researched them more before a tight deadline. Ruined my Holiday party, Unprofessional and lousy cheap rental equipment. No customer service skills and when I told them I was unhappy they said. ""OH WELL "". They are truly a bait and switch. BEWARE! Stay Clear!",1
"Well where to start? I hadn't been to Vegas in about ten yrs, and I hadn't stayed at the circus in about fifteen. Big disappointment.they sent us to the manor eww! Shoulda listened to you helpers. I had no idea that they were gonna send us there, it's like another walk from the main circus hotel and the rooms looked old and smelled old. Never again will I stay there. If I would have known.",1
"Pulled in and pumped gas into the rental car. Owner Johoticed a very low rear tire and alerted me. Patched the hole ln the problematic tire in a couple of minutes at a super reasonable price and sent me on my way. Gas prices a little more than the Circle K across the street, but solid neighborly service instead of corporatism. Recommend",2
"I waited for about 5 min at the bar which didn't even have a bartender behind it. When the bartender arrived, she pleasantly took my drink order, but then helped two ppl after me poured a soda for a kid at the bar and then closed out a check . It's not like airport bars are amazing, but this level of service was pretty poor. Oh well, beer in hand now ",1
"Stay away unless you like huge crowds and hidden fees. They say their membership is 19 something a month, billed bi weekly so 9.97 every two weeks. This is a good deal, but what they don't say is that you are billed an extra 40.00 a year for a rate guarantee fee. Plus since they've drastically lowered their prices the place is crowded all the time. Not worth the hassle or the hidden fees.",1
I am not feeling the greatest today so my friend brought over soup and sandwiches for lunch from TK cafe. I swear I already feel better. Tomato soup was delicious and the tuna sandwich was a perfect complement. Yummy! When I'm back to feeling like myself I look forward to heading over and eating at the cafe instead of my kitchen counter for the full experience.,2
Amazing quality for the price! I ordered some ground beef tacos and the ingredients were so fresh that I actually felt really good after eating them! The meat was not greasy or overly seasoned. My boyfriend got a breakfast burrito and had the same opinion. You can eat GOOD Mexican food here for a cheap price.,2
"They had vape, good service, even helped me add menthol. If you're yelping places to get some vape gear and you're tossing between YOSI VAPES or HOUSE OF VAPES. DO NOT GO TO YOSI GO to House of Vapes, better atmosphere, better people more people more juices, more help. Everything about them is just good.",2
"Had dinner with my husband, first time at Kazuki sushi. Had all you can eat. Food was ok , I had better for the price. Service was slow like they don't want you to eat too much. So order everything you want at once otherwise you will be waiting awhile in between orders or have more beer and you won't realize your still waiting. Gave it a try and won't be going back.",1
"I normally have good experiences at Pei Wei but this location in McCarron Airport was horrible. Ordered the Lo Mein Noodles with Chicken. The noodles were rubbery and not cooked properly. The chicken was good but let's face it, it's a noodle dish and they should be the star. Not so here. Very disappointing.",1
"DO NOT take your pet here. Worst place EVER to take your pet. Our dog recently got shaved there and we are now at the vet checking for burns or other infections, because his behavior has been completely different since his grooming. WORST PLACE EVER! If you want to have your dog be in pain then go here. If you don't want to feel bad for him or her the days after then go somewhere else!",1
"Sorry to hear they are closing. I have not been there in 10 years as I live too far away but, the bread was always great. There is a bakery ran by a jewish family galileo Bakery in Scottsdale great bread and pastries but not KOSHER like Karsh was. The girl there said they would look into kosher if they get lots of requests. Go in and try them and PLEASE ask for Kosher.",2
"3 times I have returned , each and every time I leave satisfied! I am not a sushi eater but here I eat sushi! its that good. I love how everyone takes pride in the food the serve even the young teen who took our order. He did a fist pump when we said the food was awesome! He also recommended other dishes for the future which sound delicious but the Mango Sweet dish will always be my favorite!",2
"Decent .Always Decent . Predictably Decent Mimi's is not pretentious . nWhat a rarity . n. and you can hear your Table mates, nice decibel levels . NO FOOLING ! Our Sunday Morning Breakfast, came off, without a hitch. nGreat Food . nGreat Service . My Ethics . My Standards nEvery business starts with one star . GETTING MORE . HAS TO BE EARNED.",2
"I saw pictures of the drinks and it won me over. The goblet drink was big enough to share with one other person. Each item on the menu had something sweet to it. The burger had the white chocolate bun, surprisingly super yummy. The waffle with the chicken and waffles was amaze balls. Great location except birds kept flying in the restaurant lol",2
I'm sold. This place has too many of the same cheap items I can find at the grocery store or discount stores like Target namely party stuff and gift wrap and tissue paper and arts crafts . Why go spend more than a dollar for the same stuff? I'm not. Staff is friendly and place is clean and well organized. Plenty of parking space too.,2
"Really good food. Had the Bryan sandwich split with a friend and cup of brocolli cheese soup each. Order at the counter, food delivered to table. Owner stopped by table to make sure everything was ok. Nice touch, as mentioned before prices are a little high but food is very fresh, unique and tasty! Not a lot of seating, scones looked wonderful, gonna have to make another stop to try these.",2
"This house reminds me of the movie saw. It's not scary. It's more of a psycological thriller. The sales person said it would take 12 to 15 minutes to get through and we were through it in less than five. I would not recommend going to this production, instead go to the 13th floor off of Bell Road and I 17.",1
"Don't waste your money.I have been to many vegas hotel spas.the facilities are okay, the massages were fine, however, the dressing room attendants are so rude! They won't even make eye contact with you when talking to you. Both ladies when checking in and checking out kept their backs to me. Not the kind of service I would expect for the price I was paying. Go down to the Golden Nugget!",1
"For being on the strip, this place is cheap! Especially for the quality of food they have. The Full Montagu Good. A little heavy on the mustard sauce, but tasty nonetheless. nThe Scudetto My fave so far. I wouldn't go to Vegas just for a sandwich, but if I'm ever in the area, or if I'm by the one in Socal, I'll probably have to drop by and try their other sandwiches.",2
"Absolutely the only place I will get my nails done in Madison. They are very competitively priced and do the most thorough job on both manicures and pedicures. All the staff and personable and remember me every time I come in, regardless of who did my nails the last time. They have a ton of choices for gel polish 100 colors and are always getting new colors in.",2
"Great cocktails for 5 during happy hour. I liked the herbacious 17. Lobster roll was a huge disappointment. It was dry, had more fillers than lobster, and tasted more like a tuna sandwich. The cheesy potatoes were not my favorite. The cheese dip appetizer was decent. I like the relaxed neighborhood vibe. The service was friendly and prompt, but the food was average at best.",1
"Kayla is an amazing yoga instructor. I have been there twice the past few weeks and she taught both classes. The studio is nice and small and same with the classes. They have the mats there for you to use which makes it very convenient plus it's located inside Spa Lamar so you can't help but feel ""zen "" when you're there. I can't wait to go back and am so glad to have found a great yoga studio!",2
"After going to the same nail tech for 12 years, we moved from Peoria to Fountain Hills. I had to find someone in the neighborhood. Found Doreen at Go Divas. Lucky for me! The shop was clean, people were friendly, and Doreen knows how to do nails. She listened to me and was meticulous. I booked my next appt before I left and hope to be a regular!",2
"From the valet greeting when driving up, to the back to reality of checking out, Bellagio is a lovely, wonderful, elegant, first class experience. Been there for work, for play, for conferences, for the poker room, for the buffet. WHENEVER I'm in VEGA I always spend time, and money, at Bellagio. PS No matter where I'm staying in the 89109 I always hit Bellagio Buffet always, no exception period.",2
"We had visited a few times before my last review and 2 times since that review and it has only become worse. Drinks, food, service all terrible. The worst thing for me is when you bring up an issue they seem offended that you dare suggest it's not perfect. For example a margarita with no tequila or a cold appetizer We've had both happen . We won't be returning.",1
"Walked in for lunch, nice cozy little place. Wasn't expecting much, but the food was so salty, I had to gulp it down with water after each bite! 10 for 3 little meatballs that seem to be made of fat! was really not worth my trip. Don't order the meatballs if you come here, but I won't be returning anyday soon! and I don't recommend them to anyone.",1
"Loved this place! Came on a Saturday night! Dj was killing it! The beautiful ladies were awesome! Had old fashions and rum juice I came out to 90.00. The bartenders took good care of us. Only thing was that there were times were it was hard to see the dancers not as frequent as I would've liked to see them, but overall we had a great time!",2
"This is probably our favorite breakfast restaurant in Madison. The service is great. There are friendly faces everywhere you turn. The food is fantastic, everything on the menu is worth eating. The pancakes are outstanding, the texture is perfect and just the right amount of sweetness. Every other dish is also just as good. You definitely have to try this place. Right five out of five stars.",2
"I have been going to Great Skate since I was a little girl. It's SO fun going back to this place as an adult! I love the fun music, lights, and games! It's nice that they offer deals a lot on daily deal sites too. I am not a huge fan of the skating 'sessions', but it seems like most skating type places have these sessions now.",2
Don't go in if u r a gambler. They have some odd rules regarding drinking gambling. You only get one well bev or beer per 40. If you somehow win then they will give you a bill for what you drank. It is the worst gaming bar I have been to. Several of my gaming friends say the same thing. Go to any other bar in Vegas rather than this place if you expect to be treated well as a gambler,1
"Every time I visit Las Vegas I go to this Raising Cane's location, and for the last 7 years or so. I always get hot, fresh, tasty moist chicken fingers, hot crispy French fries, chilled cole slaw, buttery crispy Texas toast, and the special dipping sauce is outta this world!. Hard working efficient servers. So consistent in everything they do!",2
"The main reasons why I order often is because I work in the area and they deliver. Overall the food is good. The chicken and beef kabobs are great, hummus and rice is ok and the salad is boring. The portions are too small for the price. You get lucky if you get the young kid or the husband to help you, they are very nice but the wife is super rude and unfriendly.",1
I have found my home away from home when I'm in Vegas. Everything about this place fits my personality like a glove.except for the damn ugly creepy wall paper in the closet. This was my first time staying there and I'm sad to say goodbye to the Venetian Palazzo. I can go on and on about this and that but it's best for you to try it out when you're in Vegas.,2
"I agree with Maria, the lady manager is very condescending racist. Mostly everyone is white, and to them she's very nice to. I decided not to work out here, It's sad to believe that these kind of things still exist. Also true about the ""key nazis "" review I've read about. You've been warned. PS This is my first review, and I usually just read OTHER reviews. BUT I had to warn people.",1
"I've been here more than a few times, but it seems like every visit I get more and more disappointed. First off, this place is small so why our food took almost an hour, I have no idea. I get the usual egg salad sandwich on sourdough with a side of fries and coleslaw. Each time it's been a hit or miss. I really enjoy the atmosphere here but I don't think I'll be returning.",1
"I stayed here in 2005. I loved it. Easy to get around, great pool etc. My recent visit loved the food, pool, casino and staff. My room was so dated. My ref rig hummed all night. The mattress was a Fred and Ethel Mertz style. Baseboards, paint, decor all needs a makeover. I caot believe a hotel would allow itself to get so run down. Not worth the money i paid at all. Next!",1
Circus circus is an accurate description of the type of people you will see here. It might have beeice 20 years ago but its a dump compared to any other hotel on the strip. There is plenty of things for kids to do and the steakhouse is superb. But if your net worth is over 5000 I wouldn't stay here.,1
"You had me at Panko! Fried chicken strips with choice of buffalo or wasabi cream sauce, a side of fries and a drink. a good tasty meal deal. I'm not a big fan of wasabi in general, but this sauce had me dipping for more. It was kickin sweet and worth the try. Menu is simple, prices are great and food is tasty. Will be coming back for more!",2
"Don't really have time to write a full review of the restaurant, but I'm a little suspicious at all the glowing, 5 star ratings for this restaurant by people who only have one review on Yelp. Seems a little fishy no pun intended . What's Japanese for shill? And yes, I have eaten there, it's really pricey for what you get. Go to Raku instead.",1
I've called 3 times to place a to go order now all 3 times not a single person at this establishment could tell me if they had gluten free products. I asked if they had corn tortillas and yes they do but the employees had no clue what I meant when I asked if they had flour near or on them. Half the time they didn't know how to say something in English. Such a disappointment. I will never return.,1
"New to the area, dropped by on a Sunday for lunch with friends. Although the pizza, wings and 1.50 coors light drafts were nice, this was the worst service I had in a long time. Waitress was terrible didn't know her product and we even questioned if she actually worked there. It's safe to say if I ever come back here it will be for take out only.",1
"Sushi was average. You can ask for real crab if you want to spend the extra 4, which we did. Sushi wasn't cut all the way through so we made a mess trying to seperate them. Drinks were good, service on the patio is a bit slow. They will forget about you at times so if you're thirsty order two drinks instead of one.",1
The shrimp enchiladas were good but the service is marginal at best. They have a great attitude and are friendly but not very attentive. Waiting to pay for 15 minutes. And they still have not come by. Good thing is we had the patio to ourselves. I would give it another try if we are in the area just to see if it was a fluke.,1
"We were told by a promoter that this place does not charge for every little thing lap dances, etc. . Boy was he wrong. If you go, expect that just breathing around one of their strippers will augment your tab. I definitely learned my lesson about this place avoid it. There are bound to be much classier strip clubs in Vegas. Something like Cheetah in Atlanta, GA would have been awesome.",1
"The Sales clerks at the gun counter are very rude and act as though you are a nuisance if you ask a question. I have had several interactions with different clerks and the culture they have developed in my observation is one that they dont need customers, customers need them. I really enjoy sportsmans and the products they offer. I sincerely hope that things get better with their staff.",1
"Upon arriving the sheets were dirty. I asked for clean ones they took 3 hours to bring them and brought the wrong size. Asked for towels brought them 2 hours later. When I asked why they said that I'm not a star guest so I'm no priority. Ummmm.no. I'll pass and won't come here again. On a good note, it's a nice hotel and in a good location.",1
wow.ive always relied on yelp to give me an honest evaluation of a new restaurant.the reviews for this place were very good.so I went out of my way to go and eat there.if your into bland tasting barbeque.bad waffle fries and eating on picnic tables.by all means go for it at rolling whatever.just a joke to call this a 4 star plus barbeque place.give me a break.,1
"Where the place is located can feel a little sketchy. Parking is only on the streets with paid meters. Once you're inside the restaurant, you'll forget you're in downtown LV. Food is really good. Service was great. Can't really go wrong with the menu. I was a bit disappointed when they didn't have beignets. The waiter gave me a weird look. Lol.",2
"OMG! The Ramen here was fantastic! I went on Saturday Night around 5 20 and it was very packed! It's a little spot, so its very cramped. but the wait was so worth it. I ordered the Gyoza, which was delicious and I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen which was absolutely phenomenal! I would recommend this place to any and everyone and I plan to return soon! Best Ramen that I have ever had!",2
"Caution do not go in Pasand unless you have a couple of hours to kill. Service is very slow, surly, and indifferent. I can see why most people order take out. The lousy service ruins any positives about the food. The tinny Indian music can get on your nerves after a couple of hours as well they volume could be turned down. Overall one of the most disappointing dining experiences in recent memory!",1
"This review is only for the margaritas. Wow! So good I don't care about how calorific it is or how hung over I will be after 4 or 5 of these. They are just that good! I think if you are in Vegas and it's freaking hot out, you gotta have at least one. Especially the frozen ones. Not as much variety of tequila as El Jardin at Santana Row Bay Area, CA but still good quality margaritas.",2
"These guys are awesome. I have taken many of my vehicles here over the years and each time I leave amazed at how honest they are and at the quality of their work. They have done countless oil changes, timing belts, starters and brake jobs for me. The vehicles are always done on time, correctly and comes back clean, no greasy seats, carpets or steering wheel.",2
"When will restaurant owners learn that great service is as important, perhaps more important, than great food? Just left Los Sombreros North . first visit . was looking for a late workday lunch. OK food, high prices, no chips extra charge , no water, no ice tea refill. They weren't even busy. 14.05 plus 2.00 tip for me. Still hungry . think I will go to Costco for a 1.60 hot dog soda. Never again.",1
"This place is terrible. It is over run with children. I understand there's a circus theme but children young, young, young still in their strollers young on the gambling floor holding your smokes ? Really? Low class. I wouldn't stay there. I don't know who would pay money to stay here. There are plenty of places you can stay for a reasonable price that are not nearly as trashy.",1
"I have been doing business with Hudson Enterprises for many years. Don and Barb are very knowledgeable and the most honest, trustworthy plumbers I've met in Las Vegas. I refer them to my clients and utilize their services on jobs ranging from remodels to hot water heaters and to minor service calls. You're in good hands with these folks!",2
"I'm not sure who voted their French Toast the best in Pgh but it wasn't me. It was their special today and I found it absolutely tasteless. My friend found their coffee to be just ""okay. "" Their bagels and bacon were delicious though. I bought a second groupon to try their lunch menu at a later date. So obviously it's worth the trip. I just wouldn't recommend the French Toast",2
"We stopped in for pre theater dinner and LOVED it. Attentive, friendly and knowledgeable servers, excellent mojitos and wonderful food, we ordered 5 small dishes and everyone was awesome. Goat cheese croquettas, tuna sliders, vegetarian tostadas all yummy. We will haventomgonto the theater more often so we can come back! Totally worth a drive from the south hills",2
"This is the most disgusting place I have ever been. My husband and I walked in and walked right out. They have raw chicken, and beef and other stuff at the ""habachi "" station and you actually have to walk into the kitchen and give your plate to the ""chef "" to be cooked. Health violations galore. Don't waste your time.",1
"Service is REALLY slow, the waitresses are not very friendly and they have no clue what is going on. Dont expect to be in and out quick. We have gone for lunch since it is close to our office and you will see retirees sitting at the bar drinking at 11 30 AM, they allow smoking so avoid this place if it bothers you. nFood is not worth the wait, although it is cheap.which means its not high qaulity.",1
"Stopped in here because I was tired and didn't feel like driving to my favorite spot. It was a hot day and it was equally hot inside. Nail spas are supposed to be where you can relax, not sweat during a pedi. Aside from the warm atmosphere it wasn't busy and I was sat in a chair with hot water promptly. staff is ok.not great, not bad. The work was decent. Would I return? No.",1
"New pizza place downtown, and it's great. New York style pizza with a good menu of pasta and sandwiches. I get two slices with sausage and a Coke for under 7. I've worked downtown for a long time and have been waiting for a place like this. Say hi to Anthony working the oven, he's a great guy and works hard to get you a great meal.",2
"I don't think I've ever been to a Nordstrom store in my life. But when I walked in here, I was just reminded of Bloomingdales. I think the people here are very helpful. I was looking at the bathing suit section and this saleswoman offered some wonderful help. Too bad the swimsuits just weren't my taste. Gosh, I think I love Nordstrom now that I'm going to go out of my way upstate!",2
Couldn't wait to try this place. My friends love it. Me on the other hand could careless for the overpriced hot dogs. I had the Mojave Dog. It was alright definitely not worth the . The chili cheese fries were better than the Dog but that's not good enough for me to go back. I'm giving it 1 star because the employees are very nice!,1
"The customer service that I received today was atrocious. I was returning a product that I purchased, still in the package with the receipt and was treated very poorly due to the return. The associate argued with me about the size of the item a harness and stated his disbelief that it would not fit. After my store credit is spent, I will not return.",1
"Well the super secret door by the dumpster behind the restrarant leads you to tiny room with pretty impressive coctails. Be prepared to wait, at the bottom of the stairs, at the door and once you get in. The service is not fast, this is not a place you go for quick drinks or with someone who can't hold a conversation. It is a place to go if you want to try one of a kind, handmade cocktails!",2
Atmosphere was old timey. Food was tasteless which is great for people that were born in the early 1900's. If you don't mind hearing all the old people talking loud cause they didn't turn their hearing aides up. Service was mediocre. I would not recommend it to anybody that like flavor in their food and likes a little peace and quiet while they eat,1
"I just moved to the area. Since this place got such great reviews, I called to get prices. I think they are expensive. Just a basic oil change I was told 44.13, they charge to look at your car give a diagnosis on any other problems where many other places don't . I'm going to keep looking for a better mechanic.",1
"Me and my wife went to san felipes cantina in Tempe AZ Saturday 6 28 08 they wouldnt let me in becouse I have my daughters name tattoo on my neck, they said just that day management told the workers not to let people in with tattoos above there shoulders. So becouse if this kind of stereotype or racism I rate san felipes cantina in Tempe AZ zero stars. And the worst bar in AZ",1
this place is tiny there are only 6 lounge chairs in the noisy tub and sauna area. so you can't get a relaxing rest the waiting room for services has lots of chairs but not relaxful as they shout out names for services showers are dirty tried a foot massage and it was not worth the 85 fir 25 min. A pedicure from a local salon does better.,1
"Got the 20 all you can eat sushi and figured I would eat 25 with and be done. But since we were in a big group 5 , the food was taking a bit long. So they served us some free edemame, then after we got our food the chef made us another 4 rolls. Then gave us watermelon for dessert. Needless to say, they had to roll us out of there. Sushi was excellent too.",2
If you want a great manicure or pedicure you need to try Lavish Nails. Jen is one of the best nail technicians I have every had. She has now opened her own business and the salon is beautiful. You are treated as if you are their most important client and everyone is so professional. I could not imagine going anywhere else.,2
"No flavor. None. I think they're trying for the no oil and very healthy thing, but it shouldn't lack so much flavor. I has to douse my Dan Daoodles in sriracha. The whole environment of the restaurant was very old and dirty. I don't plan on coming back to Arizona, but I def wouldn't recommend this place.",1
"i thought this place was crap, but my gf didnt think it was that bad. the menu was nothing special, typical phoenix restaurant choices. they ran out of the scallop dish at 7pm. we waited about 45 minutes for our food on a wednesday night. the choices were overpriced. and my mashed potatoes were cold. nuff said. ngf thinks the mussels were good though.",1
"Within an hour after eating here, I got sick. Horrible stomach cramps and throwing up. Got home and keep getting sick. I have had shell fish and sushi plenty of times before and have never been sick until going here. Service was great, our server was so sweet so I guess the one star is for her. I wont be back and risk being this miserable again. Be careful!",1
"Tried the Hef and the Amber here and was not impressed. The Hef had an over powering note of faux banana and the Amber was bland and watered down. The beers here are like someone had a concept of what beer should taste like, but no taste. Do yourself a favor and go someplace better, like Banger Brewing or Gordon Biersch.",1
"My wife and I have discovered the best pizza Italian restaurant in Union County. The pizza is exceptional. The chicken parm is put together with ingredients that will challenge your Italian grandmother. Even the basic meatball sub is delicious. Fantastic! nThe restaurant is sports bar oriented, but could easily be changed into an upscale dining venue. It's well worth your time.",2
Not even 15 minutes before closing and the guy told us that he couldn't service anything he was a fucking prick. Machines are up and running in the stores are all still open but yet he was closed and they drained all the fucking machines. Next time I have one I'll be at fucking Disneyland fuck this place,1
i have been here twice and both times i have been extremely dissappointed. the last time i ask for my money back and they refused. i asked to have the owner call me and they never did. the food was fried in old rancid oil and tasted so horridible that i couldnt even eat it. i will never eat here again.,1
I came to have menudo with handmade tortillas. Being that their specialty are tamales I ordered a cheese and pork tamale. The menudo was great but the tortillas unfortunately were not handmade. What bothered me the most was that the owner argued that they were. I would've appreciated her honesty. The tamales were not the best.b,1
"I love curried chicken and the yellow curry actually had a good selection of veggies not the typical potatoes, so I was pleased! Good prices, good service. Brown Rice, always another plus for me I try to stay away from the white carbs when at all possible, so anytime there is a whole grain option, I am always pleased.",2
Good eating. 4lbs crawfish in the hot and juicy sauce. Mild spice. Wish i had ordered a notch up. Came with corn and potato. Also ordered 2lb shrimps. Delicious all around. Extremely messy. It was nice to try something different then all the buffets i ate the previous few days. Price was came out to about 60 or so. Will be back when i visit once again.,2
I love Sportsmans ! closer than Bass pro and Cabelas too yet offers a different lineup of products in every category. i always enjoy going here and spending at least 45 min in here walking around and checking things out. Bruce in the archery dept is the man! he is very knowledgeable and goes above and beyond with equipment like if it was his own equipment and always goes the extra mile.,2
Robert the owner is a scam artist. He took the trade in and gave a suv and for 4 months he doesn't get a loan for the SUV he just keeps giving out those 30 day dmv passes. And also for the 4 months he never paid off the trade in so the loan defaulted and went in to repo. So I say to you all don't allow this man to mess your credit up.,1
"Nice restaurants, cool lobby, and pretty cool volcano show. The rooms are excellently decorated and the beds are comfortable however the doors are so thin you can knock them down and roll joints with them. It's noisy but luckily it's Vegas so it's mostly drunk sleeps anyway. Very spotty internet disconnects every few websites. Makes it hard to write Yelp reviews.",2
"Played 5 11 by 24 HCP. Despite the 25MPH winds, I enjoyed this beauty of a public golf course that feels like a country club. Full service bag drop to start. The course has homes on it, but the homes are beautifull and add to the rich feel of the club, plenty of room for your drives. Impressively maintained. Would like to try again under calmer conditions.",2
"SO good this was one of my favorite spots that I got to try in Vegas. Simple, but dangerously delicious sandwiches. The Full Montague was SO delicious. Highly recommend it. Also, their mac 'n cheese side was very good. Not to mention, this place is SUPER affordable. definitely a great deal when you are on the strip!",2
"We eat ""Goop "" for lunch once a week. The lunch buffet is great. I love all the vegetarian dishes and usually stuff myself. nWe are always greeted immediately when we walk in and our drink orders are brought to the table with fresh naan as soon as we get our plates filled and sit down. nThe owner is very nice and we love eating here.",2
"By far the best experience I have ever had at a hotel! The customer service was amazing. nI planned my friend's bachelorette party here and they were so accommodating. They even sent up hand writteotes and a bottle of champagne. nThe hotel in general is gorgeous! The rooms are spectacular and so is the pool, bar, lobby, etc. nWhen I come to Scottsdale next, no doubt I will be staying at the W!",2
"I give them 5 stars because they have an all night kitchen, they're open late, the waitresses are friendly, though a bit pricey the food portions are huge, the liquor beers are reasonably priced, the dance floor is spacious well laid out, often they have a DJ though sometimes someone's singing karaoke which I loathe and even on weeknights it can get festive whereas the rest of Chinatown is dead.",2
"Good location not too far from the strip. Cozy place, nicely decorated. Warm and pleasant food owner and servers. Flavorsome array of food on their menu. Reasonably priced. What else can one ask for? One of the best ramen I've ever tasted! The curry Katsu bowl was amazing! Therefore, I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to my family and friends!",2
"We used to live so close and so we would order breakfast takeout from there at least once a week.and the food is so consistently yummy! We moved to Pleasant Hills recently and are in search of a place that compares.so far, no such luck. The atmosphere is gritty awesomeness.the place is TEENY TINY, and you can expect to walk out with a good stink on you.but, the food is totally worth it!",2
Met here for a business dinner last week while in town for a convention. The food is phenomenal! And the service was outstanding! We had a party of 9 people and we were never waiting too long for anything. Their steak selection is delicious. Plus the desserts are amazing too! Great place to have a nice sit down dinner.,2
"Expertly crafted late night and midnight menus still available! One bartender is great, female, there is a bartender graveyard who cussed me out because I called him out in his rudeness. I even complained to management the following day. I still will frequent this joint because of their amazing 24hour deals.",2
"The hotel management suck! I called them to let them know traffic in their parking backed up to six level, after talking to hotel manager and security managers I was told they don't have anyone to manage and direct traffic , this only happens in Cesar palace, all other hotels have security to manage traffic. Never ever come back",1
"Absolutely do not stay here! This hotel has bed bugs! I came home with over 30 bites all over. The front desk did not seemed surprised at all when we asked about the bed bugs. We have yet to receive a refund even after contacting corporate customer service. The hotel is dirty, the staff is not too friendly and the hotel is across the street from a strip club. I would give this place zero stars!",1
"Soooooooo bad! When we walked in, nobody else was in there. This seemed like a bad sign! We asked for simple thai green chicken curry and rice. Asked for a 2 out of chili hot, but hot a 3, so hot! Thai fish cakes were good but the thai iced tea was so sweet it was undrinkable! . Slow top. Considering nobody was in there except us, very bizarre. Sorry I won't be back",1
"Skip this place and go to another gate if you have time. If you dont have time, I would reccomend a Nathan's hotdog or something out of the trash. The place reeked of old beer, the waitstaff seemed overwhelmed and were not too interested in making good time despite being near the gates of an airport.",1
"It's not that I hated this place, but I was very unimpressed with the quality of the sushi here. Although we only ordered four rolls we were only in for a snack , none of the rolls knocked my socks off. I guess when i'm in Vegas I have the unrealistic expectation that every restaurant is going to have amazing food, and this place just reiterated that it isn't possible.",1
"Techno House Trance music . not my bootay shaken music. But if you like it, more power to you . Overall, its pretty big venue though. Very open with lots of room to walk and people gawk. Compared to the other places . this place wasn't even packed even though there was an outrageous amount of people waiting in line to get in.",1
"My girls and I came here on a girls get away, and loved staying here. Staff was friendly, rooms were big and clean, and hotel is close to the strip, except if you're wearing heels then you'll need a taxi and if you need a taxi then I suggest to go to the front lobby because there will be a line to get a taxi. The price for what we got was great! We will be back!",2
"Tiny and unassuming, this money exchange point is built into the side of the Princes Mall. Although you won't find the cheapest exchange rates here the service is great. Occasionally, even if I'm ieed of some change, I just pop in here and slap my cash on the desk and they provide me with any amounts of change needed. Free of charge. A useful tool.",2
4 stars for a Walgreens you ask? Well it is based on the convenience of this place! Right on the strip and it has almost anything you could think of including prepared foods. The store is huge 1 1 2 levels. The prices here were double on some things from back home but what would you expect on the strip? HUGE lines waiting to checking out but they actually move people in and out very quickly.,2
"Had to wait for ages for just a tea and cake. Tea arrived, but the cake came a long time after. It apparently were in the oven, which made it hot and nice. I however think they should have told me I would have to wait half an hour for the cake. The rhubarb crumble didn't taste so good. The rhubarb didn't shine and the crumble was gooey.",1
"A great stop here in Madison. This is clearly a locals favorite. If your looking for a good diner with lots if food and good service, this is your spot. The decor is simple and reminds you of ""middle America "". The waitress was very friendly and accommodating to our slightly complicated ordering. It is cash only so be sure to stop by an ATM if need be. Overall, great experience.",2
"If you want fresh fish staring you in the eyeball, this is the place for you! We walked in and were immediately greeted by tons of different fish packed on ice and waiting to go. Our tour guide told us the history of Wholey's and you can see how far they've come. The ""rules "" posted outside of the store added a nice touch and the store is very kid friendly.",2
"Nothing here wowed me. Large beer select, but so do many other bars on or near the square. A travel channel series advertised this place, and made a special reference to their pork belly mac cheese. The pork was too crispy teetering on a chicharr u00f3n texture and the cheese was too creamy. Just not for me. Fish Friday is huge in Madison. I will try next time.",1
Stay away from this place. The staff runs a scam. They did not realize I was Canadian. First they tried to add 8 to bill for using credit card. Then they threatened me that it is a law in canada that patrons must tip 15 and threatened to call police if I did not tip. I wonder how many unsuspecting tourists fall for this. Shameful.,1
"We were served quickly. Got soup, a slice and a beer it was the perfect lunch for a blustery day. Plus their lunch time deal is for a soft drink, but our server counted the beers as our soft drinks which was a pleasant surprise. I was diggin' the Michael Jackson on the stereo as well. Seeing that this place is about fifty feet from my house I know I'll be back.",2
Amazing pizza! nAmazing customer service! nGreat atmosphere! nFair prices! nWhat more could you want? Special Note every time I have ate here one of the owners managers checks in to make sure we are taken care of and ALWAYS brings a free desert and shots of Lemon cello on the house. nKeeps me coming back! Highly recommend!,2
I have a furniture store here in Vegas and used Paul's Signs. Very happy with the job they did for me. From the beginning they were very upfront and honest. They were able to beat everyone else's price and finish the job when they said they would. I will work with these people Paul as well as recommend them to any friend.,2
"This seemed to me to be a pub that wanted to be a restaurant or vice versa. The d u00e9cor was pretty and modernish, with light toned woods and colorful, fancy art. There were limited beer options though, and the menu was small and made up of things that tasted decent but didn't really stand out. It just didn't win me over.",1
I visited Jacqueline's for breakfast while i was in the Phoenix area and I was just amazed with the whole experience. The menu was well balanced and color variation very well done and the food was just delicious. nThe staff was very friendly and I really felt l the vibes of true hospitality. nI will definetaly go back next time I visit Arizona nGreat job guys and keep up the great work!I,2
"I had to visit this place when I was in Vegas. As a fan of vintage toys and Pawnstars' show, it was a must. I saw Jonny there and was impressed with the store. Price was a bit higher for some items that I expected, but he has a selection you cant just find anywhere. Definitely a place to check out and spend some dollars.",2
"I ordered Kung Pao Chicken, but that was not what I got. No Peanuts, just a ton of bell peppers and huge chunks of chicken with no flavor and no heat. Kung Pao is supposed to be small diced chicken and vegetable. I also ordered combination fried rice, this tice tasted like like a wooden spoon had stirred it for a week. I will never eat there again, disgusting, try Rice and Noodle instead.",1
"Was the spot before I discovered Yogel's, Uswirl, and Yogurtland opened up. The chubby asian dude who works there is an ass. The women workers are friendly. Prices are high, i'm never going to a NON selfserve place again cause they always skimp you on the quantity of yogurt. Fruits are fresh though. Go there if you MUST. But Yogurtland is only 10 mins away.",1
"I always walked in front of it on my way to some friend's place and I recently decided to try it out. I have to say it's not the best place, the prices are a bit high when compared to other places and the food lacks in flavour. if you're a fan of spicy food, they can go very high on the spicy scale.",1
"Only gave one star because you can't give no stars. Tried to order off their pick a pair lunch menu, the French onion soup and chicken wonton tacos, that is clearly on the menu pic I posted. They said the chicken tacos wasn't an option. Obviously they don't want my business. I will go to Bonefish, it's right around the corner.",1
"Kristen I think thats her name is AMAZING! Seriously, she took the BEST photos of my toddler! She got him to smile, laugh and stay still! The photos all turned out great and she was so patient explaining all the packages. We will be going back again and again because we had such a fantastic experience. Go get photos done today! You wont regret it!",2
"Ok so we decided to try out Cheeburger Cheeburger, and if you love kids then this place is for you. Not only is the service slow they also messed up our order. The manager of the place is timid and does not approach problem tables and only go to ones with no problems. Just sitting here and watching numerous issues among other tables and how long food took to get served. Not sure we will be back.",1
One of the best restaurants I've been to and probably the best of the many upscale restaurants we tried in Montreal. Duck confit excellent. Pickles outstanding. Mustard great. Steak tartare good but not the best I've had. Service good. I would come back here in a heartbeat if I make it back to Montreal.,2
"Flying this airline only once was enough for me. Their hidden baggage fees are ridiculous. The flight and having to listen to the attendant trying to sell credit cards over the P.A was ridiculous too. Sorry, I just spent 3 days in Vegas. The last thing I want to hear are their attendants talking, talking, talking and talking and more taliking. I want to sleep. Just shut up already!",1
"I had received an email from a student retention telling me that I still owe money for the time that I had taken classes two weeks although these fools canceled my financial aid. I will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and I have withdrawn from the classes on the right time, but this rep. told me that the withdrawal period was Jan. 11.",1
"Although I was told my previous entry was quite useful it may have been on the ""wordy side "". So, to sum up my experience with Lisa from Next Aesthetics. nWhen ego, greed and self righteousness far outweigh the quality of service and level of customer service and intentions to truly please a good client, it becomes a recipe for disaster. I would find another injectionist.",1
"The food was delicious but the service is very slow and the servers were not comfortable describing the menu items or very attentive in general. We ate here two times recently mid afternoon meals and even giving them some slack for being newly opened, we would hesitate to be back. Work your bugs out and then open your doors, especially at these prices.",1
"Great deal pretty much half off provided through Yelp! But, I have to say that Impact Archery is well worth the value at the regular price. So much so that three of us went and one paid full price. The staff was courteous and instruction was friendly, precise and enjoyable. Lots of different bows to choose from or you could bring your own. We had a blast and are already making plans to return.",2
"Rate this place based on it's name! The food is only good if you're hung over. My family went here for a cheap and quick dinner of junk food. For what we expected, it was just fine. Large menu of cheese steaks and hotdogs. The cheese steak was dry, but the cheese and bread were good. The fries were good.",1
"Really good place. Seems to be owned and run like a true New Yorker. Pizza slices are generous. Although they have a full italian menu, I can only speak for the pizza. This place is good! You can keep it pretty cheap if you stick to cheese or pepperoni. But with that said, they have many exciting looking pizza varieties, but expect to pay a significant premium over a slice of cheese to try one.",2
"Mimosas are good, although a little small. The 'you call it' drink menu wan't bad since anything you want is 5 a pop. I had the Huevos Rancheros on a Sunday morning. Place was busy, but I didn't have to wait to be seated. I sat at the bar. Staff was very attentive and food was very good, although presentation was a bit lacking. Cool place, cool staff, cool crowd. I'll be back.",2
The best of the Best.everything made deliciously! Of course by award winning Chef. Amazing.I have been dining here for about 7 8 years and it just gets better and better! The rice to me is the key to great Chinese Cuisine. The closest to Miami Chinese food as you can get! Wow.I do wish they served Honey Garlic Chicken in Vegas though.can't find that anywhere here at all?,2
"Quick juice meal with yummy pastries Am a an of their Mango a Go Go drink for the occasional meal replacement. Staff is always pleasant and quick. They also keep the place very clean. Noise is a bit loud with all the blending going, but that's minor. Tip Try the sweet waffle pastry things. Uber yum!",2
"Fleur was bustling at Happy Hour! Cocktails were two for one so indulging in a blood orange margarita complete with salt cayenne rim and a caramel macchiato seemed appropriate. Food was savory steak tartar was nicely presented and the Nampol mesa ""wings "" described on the menu as spicy, salty, sweet were exactly that.",2
Huy cut my hair this is the second time and the second time he messed up too. came in looking for him to fix my hair. not there. lady asks me what i need i said he fked up my hair and needs to fix it. She says come back when hes here. wrf? Sheeeit service I got pics before and after . Made a hole in my hair and unevenly cuy my side burns,1
"Good food but bad service. I went with a party of 8, so tip was automatically included. As a result, it took 30 minutes for the server to take our order and 1 1 2 hour for our entrees to arrive. It took another 20 minutes for me to find someone to pay the bill. Piero's good for small groups where servers have to work for tip not large parties where they have no incentives!",1
Had never been to one of these before today when I decided a gyro would be good. Well it wasn't. The Dr. Scholl's shoe insert looking meat with the texture and shape of spam was disgusting. Please tell me who puts pickles and lettuce on a gyro? Yep! This place. The pita bread was good and the sauce was good This is what happens when vegans think they can cook.,1
"I had a pizza here and to be honest, it tasted like the same nasty pizza I get from the food court at home. I don't even understand WHY I ate here. It's so many good eating places in Vegas so why go to a mall food court? The only saving grace was the crepe from crazy crepes, but than the dirty tables just ruined that effect. I'm not going to eat here again.",1
"My second favorite National office in the nation. They are super efficient and prepared for the rental pick up rush. easy pick up, drop off and the staff is helpful. It lost a star because they never have as many cars as other large airport locations and the Atlanta National Executive isle is way better.",2
"TERRIBLE! I will never go back. I brought my car in to have them replace a back up light. After waiting for over an hour they told me they couldn't do that and I needed to go to the dealership. nSave your time, take your car to the dealership or some where that they actually know what they are doing!",1
"I LOVE DAIRY QUEEN! Well, mostly their blizzards! I went and was very surprised that you buy one get a blizzard free of the same size or smaller. This definitely made me happy D My favorite is their oreo blizzards! That's what I usually get although their strawberry cheesequake blizzard and hawaiian blizzard is also yummy!",2
"Ordered a grilled steak burrito for delivery and when I got it there was no steak. The delivery service Eats24 contacted the restaurant and said for sure there was steak in the burrito. so I guess the customer who's eating it is wrong! What a joke, food was at best average otherwise. Won't recommend this place to anyone.",1
"Absolutely amazing. My wife and I regularly visit Sushi Muramoto, and there is a reason we keep returning the food, and service, is outstanding. The Kobe beef sashimi is incredible! The lettuce wrap chicken appetizer is ridiculously delicious. The food is authentic Japanese. What more could you ask for? Thank the gods for Sushi Muramoto.!",2
"Hands down the BEST Cambodian food I've ever had! You got to try the fish amok, the silky texture salty sweet taste will just explode in your mouth! The place is very well decorated and the staff are very polite and professional. We have been pretty lucky to have a table every time we go because this place gets really populated quick. It's worth the wait.",2
"subpar. i ordered the philly cheesesteak. the sauce they used was nasty. the bread was good. my wife ordered the bean and cheese and it was much better. we also got a cinnamon sugar frybread. it was ok. i dunno. overall, it was like fair food but based on the reviews here i was expecting much more . maybe people on this side of town are deprived of good restaurants. ",1
"I had a very pleasant stay at the Aloft by the Airport. The room was kept clean and tidy. The staff made the stay very comfortable. I was here for 2 weeks and never had an issue with anything. Nice gym, complimentary breakfast, friendly bar and great reception staff. Pleasantly surprised. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you!",2
"Two stars because the staff were helpful and friendly, but getting a days old chocolate cupcake and weak IHOP style coffee they only have medium roast, no dark roast was a major turn off, especially as I had driven 5 miles out of my way having read Yelp reviews. Not worth it given I can get the same as any Starbucks and save the gas.",1
Another place that I visit once every few years thinking it couldn't be as bad as I remember it. And the place NEVER lets me down it's just as bad as I remember. The seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible. The staff is rude. The prices are too high for the quality. Just all around disappointing.,1
I had high expectations for this place. I went on a Monday for dinner and half of the food was not hot! One pet peeve I have is food that is not piping hot when served. Unbelievable! The variety was okay but only a few dishes were up to par. Definitely not worth the 80 for two people to eat dinner. ,1
"We found the restaurant staff to be friendly and helpful on our Monday evening visit. Mussels Provencal for appetizer, which was very tasty. I had grilled calamari, which were delicious. My lady had lobster roll, which was too heavily spiced. We're from New England and prefer just lobster and a little mayo! Creme Brulee for dessert capped off a lovey dinner in a nice setting.",2
BEWARE FOOD POISONING! Ordered from here last night. Waited an hour for the sushi. My girlfriend and I ate it and it was good at the time. Woke up this morning feeling awful! Sick to our stomachs. Stay away. Their service is crap as well. The guy making the sushi was really rude to me when I questioned having to wait an hour when he only had a table of 5 in house. Don't do it!,1
I love going to this spot. They've got great music and the karaoke spot is crazy! It's always fun to watch some drunk people perform. The host also does a great job entertaining the crowd. They have specials on drinks.they always mix them up. No cover charge for the girls.that's how it should be. o Sometimes there is a coverage charge if there is a special event going on.,2
"Omg. I think you need to know the fellow diners in order to have a good experience. They paid too much attention to us when we were there for dinner. We felt like we were the new kids on the block. Oh, the waitresses were talking about their latest relationship status. So loud that by the end of the night, I knew which of the girls liked another girl. Haha. Crazy.",1
"I enjoyed my stay at the Nugget, from the really nice check in desk to ease of heading right on to Fremont Street. Nice room with lots of room even in their standard size room. Love the pool area with the shark tank in the middle. And they have a lot food options throughout the hotel. I would stay here again if I was going to this part of town again.",2
"My job is about 1 2 a mile from this place. I drove by one day and decided to go in and eat lunch. Best choice I have ever made. My boss buys our lunch from here once a week. The salads are the best around, are huge and a great price. Gordon Mary are the best. The place is always crowded busy no matter what day I go in.",2
"Bunky is an ""it "" place for me, and the new location really shows the evolution of the shop from its tiny beginnings. Rachel's inventory is unique, fun, hip and charming all at once, and that goes for both men and women. Paired alongside Giant Coffee, Bunky Boutique is a must see must shop in Phoenix!",2
"No more made to order omelets and you can't pick exactly what you want in your crepes, instead you just pick from a predetermined list of crepes and pre made scrambled eggs. I understand that the change makes it faster getting through lines but it definitely isn't as great of a value as it was. The rest of the food was just mediocre",1
"This place is disgusting. I got food poisoning here. My boyfriend and I ate around 9 30am for breakfast and both left with bad stomachaches. The food is low quality. In fact I barely ate half of my turkey sausage scramble. Then I started vomiting every 10 mins and was up all night sick. I don't know whether it was bad food or unhealthy practices. My advice, stay away.",1
"It was man v. Food that drew us to deluca's the first time, but it was the food that drew us back. We went for brunch, and the peanut butter hotcakes were the star of the show, while the rest of our party had the above average huevos rancheros and the somewhat disappointing French toast. Overall, we hope to come back soon.",2
"absolutely disquisting! we went with my husbands parents for breakfast, and his dad ordered a breakfast burrito, halfway thru it he found HALF A ROACH! we called the manager over and showed the manager, he just looked at it and said ""oh it happens. "" we left right away and took a pic of the roach in the food, sent it to the health department, and they told us they had many reports against them.",1
"My friend and I headed to Harper's for a quick dinner before catching a movie at Phillip's Place. I was pretty pleased with the food at Harper's. And the menu has a lot of different American food options burgers, salads, chicken entrees, etc , which is good for two friends who can't agree on a kind of restaurant for dinner. They also have an extensive wine list, and a nice bar area.",2
"I really enjoyed this place! My dinner started with a wonderful server, who offered us a Moscow Mule. Definitely one of my favorites so far! I ordered the Filet, and my friend ordered the Beef Stroganoff. Everything was delicious! It was by far the best Beef Stroganoff that I have ever had. I cannot wait to return again!",2
"Absolutely no sales staff on the floor, in the entire store. We had some trouble locating a particular toy and couldn't find anyone to ask where we could find it. After a 30 minute unassisted search we finally found the toy my son wanted. Disappointing customer service, but I think this is the ""norm "", at the numerous Toys R Us locations we've visited.",1
I loved Javino's! nOn a scale of 5 stars I had to delegate 4 stars to the wonderful wine bar! The atmosphere was amazing and quaint! The beverages were fantastic and the in house band played some great chill out music. nJavino's is one of those places that you won't be disappointed at all! Stop by and enjoy a happy hour or an afternoon snack!,2
"Went in for an oil change they provided very straight forward, quick, dependable service. They greeted me as soon as I pulled up. I had a headlight out, which they checked with me before replacing. There were 3 people ahead of me, and I was in and out in about 40 minutes. The price was a little more than I had hoped, but well worth it for honest personnel and quick service.",2
"Quite possibly the worst steak I have ever been served. I ordered it medium, it came out bloody and I sent it back. After 20 minutes they brought it back and it was charred. It was so chewy and tough I couldn't finish two bites. Horrible. The server was incredibly slow and inattentive. I may have a drink on the patio some day, but I will not eat at this place again.",1
"I really love Ajo Al's! I've been to all the locations and they are all uniquely decorated which makes the trip to each one that much more exciting! The food at each location slightly varies, which adds to the excitement as well. My girlfriends and I love taste testing different entrees and comparing them. With that said we've never had a bad meal here before!",2
"I was NOT impressed with the typical Scottsdale douchebag doorman who kept us outside in the freezing cold even though the bar was half empty. Once we were finally inside, we had a great time. We met our friends at the bar and enjoyed a great evening. Good vibe inside and decent drinks. We will be back!",1
"Edit I don't like this place anymore! Last experience the shrimp pad thai was really blah, had no shrimp in it so I had to ask for some, and came with fried rice which I didn't even want and so less pad thai . Also service was really slow for lunch. It's such a huge room too, you just don't get the kind of personal service that you can get somewhere else, like Prommares.",1
"I've been to this place many of times. The atmosphere is old and run down, the service is slow, coming from a server myself, and it takes forever for them to run credit cards. I have been over charged multiple times! The food though it always good! Save your money on alcohol though they can't makes drinks at all here. Stick to the beer.",1
We happened upon this place last spring when we were in Arizona for business and boy are we glad we did! The interior is adorable and very diner esque. The french toast is divine. Scrambled eggs with brie and spinach sounds gross but tastes great. I can't remember now what else we had but it was one of our more memorable breakfast meals in that week.,2
"Waiter screwed up our order twice .with the price your paying, the least that the restaurant can do is serve that ramen soup on a real bowl not on a plastic bowl, kind off tacky to think they have to compete with a lot of great food places around.restroom was too far of a walk. Overall not coming back but will always support Fuku burger.",1
"The best. My 2 young girls can't stay away and it is often something special that we do when we have a friend over or have just had a really bad day and need gelato to tun it around. My girls also collect the cute flutted plastic cups that they serve the gelato in. Great place, atmosphere is simple but product if superior. Very friendly staff too.",2
"Fish tacos are good, but nothing exciting. First few bites of the Maui bowl was ok then the rest of the meat was very tough. Seems it's a place to hang out and have a beer at the bar. The view at night is nice from the bar, but the food is not all that. The place is missing something, it's trying, but it's missing.",1
Other than ZAS this was my favorite place to eat! They have the best food in town! The pesto pizza was amazing and so are the milkshakes. I would agree with Ellen that there is a lot of comfort food here. There is almost always a wait to get in here but it's well worth it. They also have a great salad bar that you can create your own salad and then pay per pound. It's amazing.,2
"Dutch Bros Rocks! Every time I come here, the employees are super happy and in such good spirits, singing and rocking out inside! Makes me wonder what they put in their coffee! Just kidding! . I truly love the coffee drinks here and if your like me after working 4 12hr shifts in a row, go for the ER 911! 6 shot expresso drink gets me through that last of 4! Woohoo, love me some Dutch Bros!",2
The portions were huge. My husband had the chicken and waffles. The chicken could have had more seasoning. I have the chorizo hash which could have been better if they turned down the flavor too salty . The drinks I had the orange crush my husband had the blt bloody marry was on point and we floated around for the rest of the day. We will be back when we come to Vegas!,2
"I love the Old Montreal. It's got this amazing, old feeling that makes you travel back in time. The buildings all have wonderful architecture even though I don't know much about architecture , the restaurants are good and not much pricey compared to some other places depends on where you go and everything's so pretty at night here. Perfect for a romantic stroll.",2
Dan was awesome! I use my phone for business and Verizon reccomended him because they couldn't help me. I was in a panic all morning because my phone wouldn't charge. I went to Sun Cellular and within 45 minutes my phone was fixed and back in business. Saved me! Thank you a ton! Very affordable to was pretty shocked how cheap it was.,2
"My husband and I love this place! The food is always great I'm always trying new things and am never disappointed, but I revisit the chicken and eggplant dish frequently . Portions are huge and the prices are great tonight we ordered 2 soups, 2 entrees, and got a side of rice all for 21 and had 3 boxes of food to take home . Great service, great little whole in the wall restaurant.",2
Very disappointed nThe worst sushi and tempura we have ever had! nThis is the first time I have reviewed a resturant and felt it was so bad I needed to warn others. nSushi was old and soggy and so were the tempura vegetables nBeer was warm and ginger dressing on the salad was tasteless nMust be under new mgmt nThis is the first Yelp has steered us wrong,1
Overall experience was not good. The guacamole had too much lime. They charge u for everything including salsa and for chips also. The waiter we had was not friendly. The tortilla soup was bland and served cold. The food was lukewarm when it arrived. Fish tacos were not tasty at all. I would suggest to just past this place by when your walking thru New York New York!,1
"With my experience with Goldilocks on June 23 , 2010 i tried ordering stuff from the menu and most of the items are not available and the food is not even worth the quality the way its prepared specifically the siopao turns out to be cold on the inside and hard on the outside as if it was microwaved EATING AT THIS GOLDILOCKS IS VERY EXPENSIVE . if i were you i would not go here . O",1
"last few times I stayed here, every time the rooms were not cleahair in the shower bathroom floor. nfinger prints on the mirror nthe worst is the curtain.does not block out light if you like gambling all night expect the room to be very bright in the day time. ndon't think I am coming back for the above reasons. nhouse keeper needs to work harder.very bad job.",1
"PATHETIC! I showed up at opening and was told ""We don't have waffle mix, should be here some time soon. "" It took 45 minutes for us to get our food and they were asking us what our order was. Other people were getting their orders before us. Finally we get our order they FAILED to include the eggs and grits. Pathetic service, pathetic portions, and completely over priced!",1
"This is by far the best buffet that I've been to. The prime rib, BBQ duck, and ribs were absolutely delicious, unlimited wine and beer are included, and the desserts are to die for they include gelato and many flavors of macaroon . The variety of items to choose from is much greater than at any of the other buffets they even had stir fried crab.",2
"i was enjoying my date and the food and felt as though i had just found a great little hidaway place to bring others and then at the end of the meal a roach skeetered out across the table. pointed it out to the manager and he was able to collect it,but now i caever go back.payed the 50 tab and did give the waitress the deserved 20 and left",1
"I have been there three times, each time ordering different food. Some are fantastic some are rather average. The mango chicken is nice, though a little bit too sweet. The Pad Thai is fine but Singapore Fried Noodle is average. The beef broccoli, I forget the exact name, is average. The drinks are nice, though expensive for canned juice.",2
"Had a terrible time the one time I went. We had bottle service and they put us the furthest away from anything. Then moved us to the back. The dance floor smelled like stinky feet, and the crowd was not all that great either. In the end, horrible staff, horrible service, minus our waittress , crappy music and average crowd. Definitely not going there ever.",1
Placed a to go order and it was terrible. Ordered the grilled chicken. I'm nNot sure what I got though. I'm guessing maybe the Cobb salad. The bacon in it was terrible the croutons were salty. Half our order was missing. When went back up pick up what they forgot to give us. All he offered for our inconvenience was one small nLemonade. Thanks man!,1
"This is by far, my favorite Apple store. I've been here on 2 seperate occassions and while I've never purchased any hardware here, I have gotten some good accessories. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is great. Nice way to cool off from the HOT strip. I even stayed next door at the TI hotel on my last adventure because the mall is so nice.",2
"The Bottom Line a wide range of unusual tapas that will have you eating your face off. Pros n The service was excellent. n The food was delicious. n If you're a carnivore, omnivore or herbivore. you are in for a treat. Cons n This is really minor. More could be done with the outside area given the excellent views of the city.",2
"After living in Korea, I want to say that this was the worst Korean food I've ever eaten. Not only is it horrendously overpriced, but the service is dissimilar and slow. All Korean restaurants offer side dishes to the main course, and this does not. How can you call a place 'Kimchi' when you don't even offer it? I suggest you stay away. It's not worth the time or money.",1
"Well. Where Do I start. From the microwaved Philly Cheese steak, a minimum is 15 per hr. Policy that I was told 3 different times and still trying to find out what was that all about. ESPN was there a moved out. This place is a big joke with food tab too boot Your better off going to Hard Rock Cafe by all means! For better food times.",1
"It's a great, creative restaurant. Small, kind of a hole in the wall, but they come up with a lot of tasty dishes. I never would have thought to put sweet potato puree in a burrito, but surprisingly, it works! I love the BD quesadilla and Carnitas burrito. If you call for delivery, service is quite fast. The people who work there are fast, friendly and efficient.",2
"My grams surprised me for lunch today. How sweet! She chose Uno's, I think they should change their name to Ohno's. Had the chicken sandwich, bread was stale. Grams had the fish and chips and they never brought her ketchup or vinegar even though she asked 3 times. Her friend ordered a deep dish and the bottom of the pizza was still doughy. I don't think this place will ever get it right.",1
"All area is a kingdom of cheep shops, starting from Lidl and Farmfoods by Peacocks, Poundstretcher and everything for one pound, or something like that if you are suffering from lack of fund, you can quickly sell jewelry in HT pawnbroker for 30 of real value In the evening, you better not to go there.",1
"Convenient, but not the deal they claim when you get the oil change with the car wash. The tues wed thurs special is 29.99. They charge a lot for all the extras. Need wifi, especially when u r sitting for 45 to 60 mi nFairly good car wash, but they stick it to u if u need synthetic oil. Normally 29. 99, they charge u 30.00 more.",1
"I have a friend who loves this place. My third visit, I just don't understand it. The chicken in my wrap was just terrible, I couldn't eat it. I wonder if it comes in pre cooked? The only redeeming factor would have been the biscuit , however I never got my promised biscuit. Tried to flag down server, but it did not work. I hope I don't have to return.",1
"I was looking forward to trying this place after seeing Bachi featured on television. Service was great, people were great, but I just couldn't appreciate the fusion of Asian and American when it comes to burgers. If I were to go back, I'd go with a typical American style burger. Not that the food was not good, it just didn't appeal to my palate",1
"My sister and I took our two nieces and nephew tonight. We haven't been in awhile and now I remember why. Everything we ate two appetizers and our dinners were loaded with salt. It was awful. I had ordered the fried cod terribly salty. When I peeled the coating away, the fish itself was delicious. The server was friendly and efficient, which was great.",1
"I love this place! I would eat here every day if I could. Great happy hour. Never disappointed with their spicy tuna, cowboy or chimi rolls. Spicy tuna rolls are actually SPICY and delicious! What a concept! The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is because the service is almost always slow. I love this place so much that waiting a little longer doesn't deter me.",2
"Haven't been here for quite sometime got a chance to dine again this past weekend. Still feature the best prime rib I could ever have. A great casual dining for anyone looking for great food, ambiance without needing to dress up. You guys should try it! Luv their spinach corn specially the Yorkshire pudding.",2
"went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door.then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily, the food is pretty good i've eaten indian food in europe before and it almost stood up to that. i just didn't care for how slow they were.",1
I get food here often. Today they decided to not put my tofu fries in the order. I don't see how hard it is to ensure the customer get what they pay for. I guess if I decide to return I will just have to treat them like incompetent fast food workers and checks entire order. This sucks because I really like their food.,1
"Loved it! Went on a recommendation from a friend. I'm picky but always polite, and my nails came out fantastic! Everyone was very friendly and funny! They spoke English pretty well and were able to joke around and really made me feel comfortable. This place is pretty busy but no one was left waiting. The techs are quick and efficient. I think I've found my new place!",2
Brought my bike in to get it repaired and left with both tires flat told that they are dry rotted even though they are less than 2 months old. I don't believe that my bike was stored in the correct way. I recommend fixing your bike yourself if you have the tools or the ability which I should have done in the first place I guess,1
I was told by a bouncer that this was a good late night spot to eat. I showed up at 2am and had to wait for them to clear out the drunk idiots. Then I was informed it was a 5 cover to come in and eat a 12 burger. On a date so I paid it. NEVER AGAIN. what a joke. You should be happy people even come to eat and you have the nerves to charge 5 cover. WTF,1
"Not worth your time or money! Pool Tech will nap in his car and smoke in your yard for 30 40 minutes then rush to dump a bunch of chemicals in your pool. When you voice concerns to the owners they apologize, but nothing changes. Chemicals left in my pool stained my newly resurfaced slide, but when I called to report it another excuse was given.",1
"Those who desire home delivery beware. After 1.5 hours and several phone calls regarding status, we finally gave up and called to cancel the delivery. We were told it would have taken yet another 20 minutes. We have eaten here numerous times and this is too bad the food is decent, but the home delivery is not at all reliable. If seeking delivery, move on to a different restaurant.",1
Haven't done any reviews before but I felt obligated to warn everyone of this unsanitary resturaunt. The food was a bit cold but it was okay. I got home that evening and was extremely sick. I went to urgent care and they told me I had gotten food poising. I should have knowot to try such a random little resturaunt. BEWARE!,1
"Stopped in last week to look around. I found James to be very helpful and no pressure. I also very much appreciated the fact that he didn't try to ""up sell "" me once i told him I was on a budget and didn't want to spend more than X amount. The mattresses he showed me in my price range were very comfortable! Thank you James and R S!",2
"AZ 88 is really great at everything it does. Burger was one of the best I've had in a long time. get it with all the cheeses, you won't be disappointed. I like the classy drinks, but I would only go here to have a few drinks. not for a night out on the town or anything. Place is great to go to have great food and classy drinks, good conversation.",2
"The food here looked great. After reading several great reviews we decided to head in. Specifically to try the knots. They are really delicious. The biggest problem i had was the smell of smoke in the building. I am pretty sensitive to second hand smoke and of all the casinos on Freemont, this is definitely the worst. Yuck!",1
"Excellent, authentic Italian Restaurant. We had a ""Special "" dinner there for a large group 12 and they did a wonderful job for us. Ordered from the menu and each course was delivered at the same time to each person. We found that to be quite a feat. n Nice selection of wines, really good food with attentive service at reasonable prices. n We'll definitely go back.",2
"I've been here three times and each time I tell myself I'm not going to bother coming back. I've had the Caesar Salad before, BAD. Today I had the wildflower salad. It was so blah and small. Especially for the high prices. There's always a long wait to order and an even longer wait for the food to come out. I don't know why I bother coming back.",1
Honestly the best burger I've ever had. Mac and cheese burger. Comes with four different types of fries. Ask for a side of ranch for the fries. Creamy and garlicky. YUM! A must go when in vegas. Aside from the food the atmosphere was great and the staff was very friendly. Oh and love the skull napkins. Had to buy a pair to take home.,2
I think this is one of the best quality sushi around Vegas without paying STRIP prices. Happened to come on a night they served Big Eye Tuna sashimi and it was melt in your mouth GOOD. The roppongo roll is always a favorite of mine but I try to stick to the nigiri and sashimi since the quality of the fish is so good. Come early since the place is small and becomes packed easily.,2
"No further contact from this business. My bank stepped in when I filed a complaint and even then they held out until they were forced to refund. Aside from enjoying the product, I will not purchase another from this company due to this experience. There are too many other spas that will blow bubbles just the same adios Tuff guys !",1
"This restaurant is overated, told them service was bad, lousy food was cold, manager came over and was just as rude as server, if you don't want complaints do it rite, the first time. If you want a great meal go to the egg and I or cracked egg where they care about there customers and feed back. To big for there bridges horrible food, horrible service, horrible managment!",1
"Wish I could leave zero or negative stars. Place was severely understaffed and untrained. Dropped my car off at 3pm, was told it would be ready in 2 2.5 hours for a rotate and balance . Showed up 3 hours later and my car hadn't been touched. Took the keys and will not be back. Head to Discount Tire at San Tan Village or NAPA just a street over for good, quality, competent service.",1
"We went around 6pm and were the only ones in the restaurant. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. He was helpful ordering from the menu. nThe food was super yummy. It wasn't as spicy as I usually like, but flavor wise it was fabulous. It was reasonably priced for the amount of food we got. I will definitely go back and check out the lunch buffet.",2
"The food and service was excellent. Mario was are server did a great job and made some good suggestions. The ultimate naan was awesome, a great starter. I had the lamb vindaloo was perfect a 7. My wife had the shrimp tikka masala, very tasty sauce almost like a bisque. This was are first visit, we'll be back again.",2
"Pros Nice, large outdoor seating area. Cons Weak drinks, looooong wait on drinks and food. Service was lacking for a weekday night. Neither me nor my fiancee was very impressed by the service or drinks here. My food was good enough but probably because it just had so much cheese. My fiancee wasn't a real fan of his entree. I highly doubt we will be back unless we both get amnesia.",1
"This is the best noodle house in las vegas! It's a small venue but the service and food is awesome! They only have 4 different types of noodles but believe me you will be satisfied with selecting anyone of them. If your still hungry, save your soup because they can add more noodles for you and make sure to always add the extra chashu pork. It's soooooo goooooddd!",2
"A true hidden culinary treasure. A great restaurant with beautiful facilities, very clean and friendly with fresh food. I am now eating the lunch buffet and the taste of the food is amazing! The only reason I am giving it 4 star rating is the limited number of dishes offered. Come to this place for the QUALITY of the food not the quantity. I would cerainly recommend.",2
This place should be way more packed than it is. I think people don't know what to expect here they need to put sushi bar on the sign. If you like Sushi this is the place! By far the freshest tasting fish in Charlotte. Service is excellent from the valets out front to the hostess and servers. They also have a nice patio. I'll be back.,2
"Went in for lunch today and walked out after waiting 20 mins for a server to come to our table. No one came by, no water, no one to take our order, nothing! Servers were either all yacking behind the counter or all 3 of them waiting on 1 table. Everyone should skip this place and go to New Mexican Grill instead.",1
"Eat here weekly and is consistently great. My cardiologist has me on a crazy restrictive diet that limits me to no grain of any kind, no diary, and no processed sugar in addition to watching my sodium intake. And you can imagine this limits what I can eat significantly when going out. Thanks Pita Jungle for actually having several options that fit the bill and are tasty to boot.",2
"Best Italian food in Las Vegas. I found the prices to be very reasonable, the portion sizes were a very good value, and the food quality was fantastic. The manager was very personable and offered detailed recommendations for new diners based on our tastes. Hands down best meatballs in the city. It was an outstanding experience and I can't wait to go back!",2
"Never coming back. nI've been here twice before but after today I won't be back. The booth they seated us at for lunch was dirty. The service was slow but most of all there were two dead flies on the inside of the window. When I pointed this out to Gia that the window needed cleaning, she said ""oh yeah "". nI'm. Done.",1
"The bottom line is this if it's not on the menu here, then it's not really Mexican food. I eaten in Guadalajara. The food at Taco Bell tastes exactly the same. Nachos, tacos, burritos. The flavors here are a culinary journey south of the border. And the little se u00f1oritas who take your order are not bad either.",2
"Friendly service and great food! Tucked away just down the street from my home, I lived in the neighborhood 2 years before I discovered this breakfast lunch gem! I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good breakfast in a relaxed atmosphere. Reasonably priced with homey decor and a staff that knows how to treat people like people.",2
Dead on Thursday 11 8 the bouncers tried to hose us for 25 per even after we them which VIP list we were on. We decided to leave but as we were walkn out they Let us up Free of Charge! Free of charge into a Dead nighclub.Expensive drinks are to be expected but expensive and badd not soo much. nGreat views but wouldnt go back for the Club or bad bartender service!,1
"This show was amazing, worth every penny and i would do it all over again! The theater wasn't huge so i think any seat in the house had a good view. I liked the story line and the dancers did an amazing job. Getting to see Coco Austin was a bonus i wanted to watch this show from Holly's world, but i think Coco did an amazing job!",2
"Pretty delicious and fresh. Modern atmosphere and delicious breakfast. I love the iced mocha and the tasty eggs with avocados, english muffins, and spinach. They provide siracha sauce too! Mmmm The only problem I had was that ordering area was two crowded and disorganized. It was hard to squeeze past people after I ordered.",2
Food is what you expect but drive thru wait times are consistently the longest of any El Pollo Loco I've ever been to. Today there were no cars in front of me and it still took over five minutes for a rather simple 2. I was handed the wrong order and then had to wait another few minutes. I have been handed the wrong order and not the requested salsa multiple times.,1
I can sum it up in 1 word Horrible. First floor is tiny! Drinks are crazy expensive and not very good. The guest list is a joke! They made us wait an hour outside for no reason. Music was decent and the atmosphere was borderline douch y but ok if mind your own. There are too many good places on the strip to go back to this place.,1
"Excellent sushi here. All chef at the bar are Japanese too. They have traditional Sushi and also creative menus upon request. I recommend you to sit at counter. Very nice chefs can explain you about where the fish comes from, etc. nThe atmosphere at other tables are more like upscale bar lounge and totally different feeling from the counter. It is pricy but it worth to try in this town.",2
These folks are worthless. We stopped by their design office and got the promise that Jeff Gaylord will call to look at our bath room. After a week he did not call. I called him and he promised to show up. He never called or showed up. I called again today and got the same runaround. I will never recommend them to any one.,1
"So far I have seen Twilight and Gran Tornino in this theatre. I love this theatre. It's huge. I did sit in the 3rd row from the screen, but let me tell you. It was still an awesome place to sit and enjoy the movie. The sound is great. I think the introduction done by the staff is a little funny, but it's informational.",2
"Thoroughly disappointing! Guess I've been spoiled by so many great ""newer "" restaurants in town. This place's been around for awhile and somewhat ""iconic. "" Good location to meet up for a lunch meeting but other than location, it's not a place I'll go for food. Our food lacked freshness and taste overall.",1
"Lately I've been doing a lot of business in Madison and this has become my home away from home. Property is new and it lives comfortably for a good rate. Great view if you get an eveumbered room. Be sure to ask for that. Also, a very very short drive from great shops and restaurants in the East Madison area.",2
Nothing special. I have had better ramen. Looks appetizing but flavor is flat. So not get the pork belly buns. They are not that great either. I would pass on this place. Quite expensive for something that is bland. Service is also not so great. I didn't get a spoon and had to ask for it 3 times for my ramen. Still didn't get it. Also they did not give us any refills until we paid.,1
Free Ride to 3 hotels is sick. you can take the express Tram from Excalibur to Mandalay Bay. the only thing is if you're going to Luxor you'll have to get off and ride the other Tram that's going the opposite direction. the Tram can get crowded. it can also get hot inside. it's still beats walking in the heat though.,2
"Just great. The focus on fine meat is delightful, my wagyu beef was heavenly. Our server team was great, victor went out of his way to track down lillet blanc for me, apparently something rarely ordered there. Beet salad was spot on, love the addition of a pickled egg. I will go here again the next time I find myself in Vegas.",2
The chicken wings were just blah. I got the original bbq and I swear there wasn't even any sauce on them. Dry. My fries tasted like the sweet potato fries they were probably cooked right next to. All that and delivery takes over an hour and they 4 . Not really worth it maybe the restaurant experience is better.,1
"Best coffee on Walnut. Ice cream is excellent. Like the other commentators, I feel the service can be hit or miss, mostly because the lack of a clear location to form a line, but it is generally excellent. The venue isn't as cool as Coffee Tree, but the staff are always friendly, and again, the coffee is better. This is my go to coffee place in Shadyside.",2
"I wish I could give this place no stars if that we're an option. I called in to make an order and asked of I could do 2 separate transactions. She said ""why you make this so difficult? "". I decided not to eat from there. Can't give a review on their food. It can't be good quality with such bad service.",1
"Putting a high price tag on a plate does not make it good. Service excellent nAmbiance good The food was disappointing and overpriced, the ravioli, undercooked, the blue cheese overpowered the rest of the salad. No shortage of expensive vehicles carefully positioned by the valet, but I'm afraid that money can't buy you good taste.",1
"Five stars because it's a place were comfort food meets a classy and friendly atmosphere, meets a perfect and very attentive service. The duck breast was spectacular, I'd totally recommend having the duck. It took them longer than expected to bring us the starters and they came separately, and they took them off the bill. We were definitely delighted by great food and a great service.",2
"You definitely get what you pay for. Even tho we paid the same price here as we did at the Paris buffet last night, the food was dismal. The fresh omelette station was a good addition, but nothing else was worth it. Prime rib was disappointing, if I have to be nice. I mean, all the other prepared foods I can understand.but HOW DO YOU MESS UP SOFT SERVE?! Even that sucked.",1
"The staff is beyond rude. They're downright racist and I will never go back there. This place used to be great when they first opened My last 3 trips were awful and I won't be going back after the last horrid encounter with an openly racist salesgirl. If you're not going to serve people of all colors, then you better expect to NOT stay in business very long in this town.",1
"Yeh is Meh. The concept may be interesting, but I feel as though the flavors are not all that great, the toppings are fine, but the final price is what gets me every time! It's very easy to get a combination that will cost you almost 10 dollars and that's with a small amount of yogurt and some fruit! Decor is cute, staff is ok on occasion.not the best place to cool down in the hot Montreal sun.",1
"Amelie's French Bakery is exactly where it should be, in the art district NoDa. The place is fantastic and I wish I could eat here everyday. The breakfast sandwiches are amazing and priced reasonably. The decor is eclectic and fun. I can't wait until I'm on that side of town so I can drop in and indulge in a delicious pastry.",2
"They sell their gyros in 4 sizes 2 oz, 4 oz, 6 oz, and 8 oz. This is pretty neat as a large or medium gyro should be enough to suffice a hungry person. However, I have to say that their gyro meat isn't as succulent as I thought it'd be. The Greek salad wasn't anything special either. I gotta say that I prefer Niro's Gyros more.",1
"Waitresses hostess were very polite. However, Extremely slow service despite the place being empty. Took about 10 15 mins to get water and quite a while to get our meal. My BF ordered the patty melt which he said was very good and I ordered the spinach artichoke dip. I wouldn't recommend it tasted like frozen creamed spinach.",1
"As someone who doesn't like ""real "" sushi, as in I like my food cooked. This place was the pits. Very small selection of non raw rolls. It seemed like all they offered was california roll with this and california rioll with that. I was very disappointed in the selection and it is really cramped in there. It was ok, but I have definately had much better",1
Really amazing food. Great breakfast sandwiches prepared well and creative mixes of ingredients. Unique food you won't find anywhere else and at a price that'll ensure you keep coming back. nI'd been looking to try Cracked for a long time and was thrilled to finally get the chance the other week. Looking forward to trying Cracked agaiext time I'm in Champaign.,2
"Wor won ton soup Chicken and mixed vegetables. 23.60? I ordered around 8pm, and i recieved my food at 9 30. i received two small containers that did not have enough food for two people. Wor won ton soup flavorless, and two won tons. nChicken with mixed veggies a whole lot of veggies, no chicken?! So to sum it all up, slow service, flavorless food, and no chicken!",1
Good choice for inexpensive and quick vegan and vegetarian dining. Outdoor table so the dog could come along. In the heart of Las Vegas' Chinatown. Thai and Vietnamese influences welcomed break from grabbing something at Whole Foods. Appetizers to full entrees made either vegetarian or vegan with an emphasis ooodle dishes.,2
"Ordered two of the same meals and my taco was not what I ordered. My friends taco was so spicy it burnt her mouth. Mine was so spicy I ordered milk. My carnitas taco was full of grittle. Wait staff tried to fix the issues but they can only fix so much. If you like super caliente food, then this place is for you.",1
I really don't know why I keep going back here. The service was pretty bad this time around and the food was worse. I ordered steak quesadillas and they were filled with steakum! Wtf? THe only thing that Hooters can make edible is their Buffalo Shrimp. Carolina Pavilion desperately needs another sit down restaurant.,1
No carry out on Friday nights!?! I'm new to the area and was looking to trying Dexters Friday fish fry after hearing so many great reviews. Unfortunately I didn't get the chance as they do not provide a carry out option on Friday nights. I was speechless went told this over the phone! I did try another place Brothers Three that was happy to provide carry out to this customer and it was wonderful!,1
"My grocery bill is about 1 3 lower than it was when I shopped at Copps. They don't have a huge selection, but for basic groceries they have most things. The prepackaged deli meats are excellent, much of the frozen food is great, and things like bread, milk, and eggs are very low priced and good quality. Everybody I've talked to who works there seems very nice.",2
"Worst choice in Scottsdale! The server was beyond rude, it took us almost two hours to eat out dinner, the table side guacamole was gross and the server was one of the worst I have ever had. The food was overpriced for what you get, go to Baja Fresh and you get the same food. Actually twice as much for half the price.",1
"At the end of your night, come to Bill's and get yourself a 99cent margarita then hit up Drai's one of the few only after hours clubs. Not a fan of the rooms, but they're incredibly cheap and the location is pretty sweet for that price. Also, I somehow always end up here for late night breakfast. it's incredibly tastey. or perhaps I'm just that hungry, not quite sure .",1
"me and my friend try this new vig food, its ok but service is really bad,i try to talk to the manager about it but did not even pay attention about it,me and my friend was very surprise about the staff being lack of training normally in this kind of restaurant is very well trained and manager normally is in top of everything but not this one!",1
"Wow, first time in and yep I likey! I split a sandwich, I think it was a club, it was amazing. Really fresh, I am a fan. nIt was about 8pm on a Thursday, pretty slow to be honest just myself, hubby and another couple . nThe staff was friendly, helpful and prompt, the store is large and very clean! nI will be back!",2
"You may not think of Italian in Scottsdale, but if you miss this place you should skip your trip altogether. The food is straight from southern Italy and family run, greeted by the mother and served by the son, a meal worth flying in for. Jon Lindsay the 6 45 reservation that showed up an hour early just to get some home made gnocchi and penne vodka with salmon",2
My BF and I saw this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. We absolutely loved it! Very refreshing and unique menu. nRight when you walk in the staff greets you and give you a sample of the meats they offer. I went with the steak and my bf went with the chickeLoved the food and the service was awesome! Very friendly and upbeat staff! We will be back very soon!,2
"I've had some great bottles here, including what I now fondly remember as THE best wine in my entire life which they have unfortunately since discontinued . The side dishes are also pretty solid. It has an upscale vibe classy yet unpretentious. Great place for a date or a drink with a friend. I'm a big fan.",2
"Wow, this place really exceeded my expectations. Excellent, amazing, wonderful pizza! I would say it is right up there with Pizzeria Bianco, but without the wait. We will definitely go back soon. The Beet salad was delicious and perfect, and we had the margherita pizza, which was totally amazing. Love this place!",2
I just ordered takeout here and spent close to 30. Not only were we missing food from our order but we were extremely dissatisfied with how it tasted. I called and was given a series of excuses as to why the food was missing. I have never had Chinese food like this ever. DO NOT GO HERE! This place is not even worth one star.,1
"I don't want to tank this place because the host couldn't seat people properly. We actually never got seated because waited so long. All I can judge this place on was the employees and they were talking crap about the customers, so I'm sure I wont come back to this location anytime soon unless they actually accept a reservation.",1
"Do not visit the GOLD LOUNGE for OPEN BaR! What false advertising, cheap drinks come with a 50.00 door fee! Ridiculous, NOT TO mention the most unpolite doorman ever! nBeautiful hotel that needs to pay more attention to the customer service areas! nWill only recommend this hotel as a site seeing spot not a hotel to stay. Boo on bad customer service!",1
"Worst Discount Tire ever! Always been a loyal customer, if it wasnt for this one. Broke my centercaps everytime they balanced and rotated my tires, said they ordered me new ones, 4 months later and nothing! Acted like they didnt know what I was talking about. Worst service ever! Skip this one and move on to the one in Gilbert, much better!",1
"Worst customer service. I could swear that the employee that took our order through the drive thru had just woken up to take our order on a Sunday at 9 30 am. We pulled up to the window, waited three minutes at the window without being greeted or acknowledged so we just drove off and tried Tamales Guadalajara for the first time it was so yummy! Definitely won't be coming to this location again.",1
"I have parked exclusively at Preflight for more than 8 years, nearly every week. the stays have normally been 3 to 4 days, but as long as 2 weeks. there's a speed pass option to avoid the pay window on exit, and auto pay, allng eigh a great frequent parker program. Juan, Steve, Julio and Eddie are favorites, but every one if them have been fast, friendly and professional. thanks preflightphx",2
"In November, the Lee's on west Flamingo had a big political sign supporting the rightwing anti marriage equality nutjob Mark Hutchison. Mr. Lee can chose to support political candidates who are bigots. We can choose to buy our wine and spirits elsewhere. I don't think buying a bottle of wine should involve politics.",1
"You say dont trust people who give it 1 star because they are from other haunts, and yet you give it 5 stars? If someone gives a haunt 5 stars it is safe to say they work there . No haunt is 5 stars, And i have been to many. there is ALWAYS room for improvement. Animatronics are cool, but that is it. the main character is not even in the place, stupid.",1
Very fresh and delicious. A wonderful menu.tons of healthy choices. I got the sandwich soup combo. White been soup was delicious. and the turkey bacon avocado sandwich.hold the bacon. Very tasty. The soda ice tea drinks are many. Everyone who worked there were happy and helpful. Fresh cool interior design.,2
We are having our 1st baby. Made an appointment to do the ultrasound to find out the sex of the baby. We made an appointment for the chandler location and were excited to find out the sex. We walk in to find out they made our appointment for their Mesa location. Nothing like rushing on our big day. This place has horrible appointment setters. I will keep you posted if the doctors do too.,1
"Well since I stop here on my way home from work every Friday I have to give it 5 stars. Some of my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. The cheese blend is really good. Firm, not too greasy, and the sauce is really well balanced. But how about the crust? Really nice texture. Perfect chewiness. I would recommend Perfectta to anyone!",2
"The Home Fries are to die for! No.the Chipotle Sausage is to die for! Forget it.I died and went to breakfast heaven! You can tell the place is worth the try, by the lines and the fact that people are more than willing to wait. Nice local experience, worth the trip. nI would definitely go back! Oh yea, they said goodbye to me by my first name.awww, they remembered nice personal touch! ",2
"This Whataburger is my favorite! The employees are friendly and I feel like a person, not a number when I drive through. The burgers are tasty with the perfect amount of mustard, the large soda comes in a styrofoam cup and stays cold for hours and the fries are not too salty. You cant ask much more from all American fast food! Oh yeah and they have biscuits and Gravy for Breakfast.",2
My husband and I just finished our Margherita pizza! I was craving some anchovies and black olives on top and they accommodated my request. We ordered two of the dinner salads and they were the perfect size and flavor to go with the meal. The pizza is authentic wood fire pizza and not perfectly round in shape which was another plus for us. Absolutely perfect meal!,2
"Crappy coffee, expensive to boot. Teenage employees with vacuous looks on their faces. Cream and sugar station was a pig sty . Coffee wasn't ready.you have one job make coffee.moron standing in front of me in line.orders then just stands in the order line to wait for his order. .hey Jethro this is an order line not a meditation line.fun times lol",1
"One of our favorite places to get sushi. We went to one of those ""fancy "" sushi places with the modern music and furniture. The wait staff was so rude there we couldn't wait to get done with our sushi. Kaneya sushi is extremely friendly, quiet and authentic. There is only one person working at the moment so if you go on a busy night. Cut him some slack. It's worth the wait.",2
"Omg I love this sushi restaurant! I've been to its sister restaurant, Yellowtail, and i think Kumi is better! The sushi rolls were so amazing! Have to try to Rock Star one. i think that's what it was called. It's the one with pop rocks. It might sound weird but it is definitely worth trying. This is probably my favorite sushi place on the strip!",2
"my go to mexican restaurant now! inexpensive and delicious! everything is very fresh and well prepared. I typically get the chicken taco with their homemade tortilla, the bean tostada, and the ceviche tostada. their ceviche is the best I have had in the city. not to mention their salsa is always fresh, a little hot, and very good with the free chips. ummmmm!",2
"I come to Trader Joe's for just a few things, and I leave with many more ""few things. "" They do have those lovely peanut butter stuffed pretzel pillows. They also have great frozen minced garlic cubes a great time saver. I left with a lot more today for just going in to get a ""few things. "" This is my go to store for the things I can't find elsewhere. I like Trader Joe's a lot!",2
Always have the baseball steak. A cut that isn't always appreciated. Med rare is what I always request. Can't say I have ever had a bad one here. Had the lobster during lob. month last Sep and was delish. A week later had it at San Tan and it sucked. So it veries from place to place if u ask me. I'll stick with Tempe.,2
"I've lived in Vegas a little over a year and had the itch to get some work done. Thanks to yelp and google I found this place. When I walked in to make an appointment the place was clean orderly and welcoming. The day of my tattoo I had made an appointment with Nathan, he was polite and personable. His work was awesome and my tattoo came out perfect. I would recommend this spot to anyone.",2
"every time someone recommends the place, I cringe, unfortunately in the area, it's about the easiest place to dine, that being said their pizza the only thing on the menu is terrible, i truly prefer the crap thy used to serve us in middle school. My tip, drink a lot before going so that you don't care about the state of the food",1
Food was good not great. I ordered perch and the others ordered walleye and cod. All of our food was lukewarm. My wife's walleye was like cardboard. They took it back and gave her a free meal. Overall the service was below average. They should be better prepared for a Friday night to accommodate larger crowds. We won't be going back there again.,1
"Fairytale Brownies NY Chocolate Show Too crumbly for my taste. Eileen Spitalny and David Kravetz, did I hear right? You sold your soul to the devil for money. Over 2.5M brownies made annually is impressive. Say it isn't so that you sell frozen brownies per Sophie M. . Callebaut chocolate is a nice touch, but frozen isn't cool in my book. Pics http www.meetup.com teamfoodie photos 477262",1
"This is our go to Fry's. We know the layout well usually find good deals on items we need don't need . The parking can sometimes suck. Cashiers are friendly. Prefer this location over the 19th ave Union one. My 1 complaint is that their meat department is seriously lacking! Usually only pick up ground turkey meat here, for all other meat products we go to Costco.",2
"Freaky fun environment . I kept expecting something to jump out and scare me! The staff was super friendly and drink prices are ok. The food menu is extremely small. I did not order food, so I cannot comment on that aspect of this dark, horror rest bar. It is very loud, so if that bothers you bring ear plugs but this place is a must visit for horror fans!",2
"How is this place still open? Tried it numerous times simply for the geographical convenience. Every time the food is HORRIBLE. Last experience included gross Bloody Mary's not work the two bucks, an overcooked and under seasoned salmon, soggy greasy fries and bad service. I will not come back here.",1
"This was the most disgusting place I have ever been to, I am so seriously surprised that the health department is allowing this place to stay open, I found an unidentified object in my soup, this place was so nasty, the windows you cannot see out of from the filth, the food is GROSSSSSSSS. This is just a depressing environment, not a place to waste 10.00 on a meal.",1
"We received excellent, attentive, personalized service by each employee we encountered. We recently moved to the area and had a variety of needs, from curtain rods to a BBQ grill to a new exterior front door. It was a great shopping experience. Specifically, Bruce, Melanie, and Tom were patient and stuck with us until we made a decision.",2
"Really considerate and friendly servers family and a vast menu that never leaves me bored or wanting more. Plus, you can get a bowl of their Pho, a Spring Roll or Egg roll, and a drink for 10 which is more than enough for one person. This restaurant reminds me of home in Orange County and I will definitely be back again.",2
"Rude slow service, bland food and when I was served the wrong coffee I was publicly humiliated by the bartender drink maker behind the bar. How it was my fault I took a sip of a drink that was served to me is beyond my comprehension. I will never go back. I can find better places to spend my money, thank you.",1
"Great place for lunch if you are downtown. I ordered a hummus vegetarian pita wrap and it was stuffed with fresh veggies and a decadent hummus. I could hardly finish it but did anyway! The service could be a little quicker for lunchtime but it wasn't that bad. I still was able to walk to the Pita Pit, order my food and then walk back in a half hour.",2
"Good stuff. Great lunch specials and fresh sushi. We enjoyed our long, leisurely lunch while our puppy enjoyed a cold bowl of water on the patio. Bartender was friendly and atmosphere was nice. Salmon sashimi was delicious so we ordered 3 orders. Check in offer gave me half off a glass of Sauvignon Blanc which was so good I had a to have a few. Highly recommend for a great meal in downtown.",2
Meh. This place is just ok. I thought it was a bit pricey for what I ordered and it didn't live up to my expectations. I ordered a gyro pita with double meat because I saw they didn't really put much meat on in the regular orders plus a tiny tub of hummus. The gyro meat really wasn't flavorful and the tzatziki lacked some flavor. It just tasted like plain yogurt.,1
I had the same experience with Groupon use as other reviewers did. It was not clear that if you had purchased a Groupon in the past they would not honor another Groupon purchase. I was all set for yoga and was turned away after having been a regular there in the past. Sad to say I'll be looking for another yoga studio after the bad vibes.,1
"Julia S and I were on a top secret mission today for a certain someone's birthday that will remain unmentioned. We stopped in Delicias Colombianas to grap a quick coffee, I simply could not resist the happy, little meat pie empanadas. What a great little stop, you can grab a quick coffee pastry or a full blown breakfast of champions. Two coffees and one empanda for 3.50 makes me contenta!",2
"Dropped off my laptop to get fixed, got it back still broke. I was told it would "" fix itself "" . I told them I did not take it to a professional repair shop for it to "" fix itself! "" The girl was rude, arrogant and did not give a shit! This place is a joke and the technicians are unskilled. I would not go back there if it was free .The location at 5765 centennial.",1
"Came in for a pedicure. All of the little extras added up to a 5 star experience from five star nails and spa! From the keurig coffee maker and good assortment of magazines at the front, to the large, organized display of polish choices, everything was topnotch. The amazing pedicure was a bonus. Salon is clean and staff is professional. I will be back.",2
"Tony came to our home to take care of a large Africanized bee colony. He arrived when he said he would, he was thorough, knowledgeable and conscientious. He patiently answered all of my questions about bees and just about every other insect new to me since I'm new to the Sonoran Desert. He even returned the following day to ensure that everything was fine.",2
"Dita's reminded me of a clash between Johnny Rockets meets In N Out. The place is very clean and staff extremely helpful. I ordered the Hawaiian Burger only because it had pinneaple. Food was fresh and had flavor, can't wait until my next visit. It's not far from the College of Southern Nevada, good food and decent prices.",2
"Not the TOP spot for Thai, but definitly worth the prices. Great food, good Prices, and very tentative service. Not the best location, but the food is great. We had the Red Beef Curry, and Pad see ew, bboth were great. Cant wait to go back and try other dishes,. Next will be the drunkeoodle. If my job was close by, this would be a weekly rotatioominee",2
"Some hits, some misses. The fish of the fish n chips is excellent. the chips poor. The steak pie is very poor. Dry, mealy, without any gravy. Very good oysters. Limited selection of beers for a a beer and pub food type of place. Attentive and friendly service. Great music well, I liked it , not too loud.",1
"I don't understand all the hoopla about this place. The last time I ate here was probably 2005. The burger and fries were average but I wouldn't say spectacular. The prices are reasonable and the staff are nice but when I want to enjoy a great, fresh and non microwave hamburger I always hit up Whataburger. To each there own I guess ",1
Excellent food and service. I had cioppino and husband had chicken. We had fresh mozzarella as appetizer and cucumber cooler drinks. If you like cioppino as a stew dish and not pasta sauce this is perfect! The app is incredible and I'm craving it now. Atmosphere is nice. Open and light and comfy for hanging out and pretty people watching. This will be nice dinner out place in the future.,2
Mos def one of the better korean restaurants in town. I've frequented the OG one in Glendale since i was quite younger. I'm glad they're doin well enough to even expand to Litchfield! Always had great service here too. Can't say I would know anything about the sushi though. oh well. I'm always satiated with the K food.,2
"If you are looking for a sandwich there are better options even in the same complex. The salad was good and the chocolate strawberry at the end was a nice touch, but it couldn't overcome the prepackaged wet lunch meat sandwich. Had heard a ton of good things about it, but one visit was enough for me.",1
It takes something major for me to come see a doctor. In this case I lost hearing in my left ear. Dr Dennis Dey was quick to asses the problem and prescribed medications to resolve my issues. He is very knowledgable and kind. I am back a month later for a follow up visit and my hearing has returned. I am very grateful to have my hearing back and thankful to have met him!,2
worst restaurant.it is no way comparable with Malaya cuisine in elizabeth uptown charlotte.The malaysian fried rice which I ordered looked like old and smelled really bad.I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.If you want Malaysian food I will recommend the Malaya cusine in elizabeth near CPCC central campus.,1
"When I place an order for a specific time to be picked up, 1.5 hours prior, I expect to be picked up on time. Not 15 minutes late. Unacceptable. update in cab now, driver says he needs to pick someone else up. When I express that he was late and I'm going to be late to work, he offers me a ""direct ride "" if I pay more.",1
"I always get the vegetarian cheese steak even though meat lovers would say there's no such thing as vegetarian cheese steak . Hot and totally delicious! The wait might be long during lunch, but I usually call ahead and get a take out. They also have a punch card that gets you the 10th sandwich free. Awesome sandwiches!",2
I was wearing my juicy sweatpant suit and feeling PHAT. PHAT what a pH if you know what I'm saying. I needed something hot. Something that could make one pass the breeze and I found the perfect stop. Lolas TAPAS girl! Although the cramped table required two seats space they took the chair out and brought me the picture menu.which made it easy to understand. not to mention get my crawl hungrry.,2
"Saw it on DDD. Guy steered us wrong here. I had ribs and brisket in order to give them a fair shake. Neither worked for me. Service was way slow on a Saturday around 8pm. Ribs were cold, as was brisket. Brisket was smokeless, as were ribs. Sauce I wouldn't buy even if it was at the dollar store. nI won't return. Rather drive to Honey Bear's.",1
Definitely a rip off. Flavor of the foods wasn't that great either. quantity def does not equal to the price. Miso soup was 6. Tasted like the miso soup you get in a package. Rice was 3. Ambience was okay. Definitely never going back to this place. Not worth it. My group of 15 ended up splitting up afterwards and finding more food to eat.,1
I have been their twice for Karaoke. They have an AMAZING book I was shocked to see how many songs they had. I signed up for 3 and I could only sing one of them because the other songs had bad words in them. nThat was a big NO NO! IT IS A BAR! YOU HAVE TO BE 21 TO BE IN THERE! who is going to be offended by me singing adam sandlers at a medium pace?,1
No rating preferably but it doesn't give me that option. This place sucks! I would want this place shut down and have another food joint replace it. The wait is ridiculously long. Worser than any another fast food place I've ever had to wait for. Whats the point of having a fast food joint if your not doing the job right quickly. Gtfo!,1
All I can say is 'food coma' and its 100 positive! Wasn't sure what to expect when I walked up to the restaurant's door but believe me the food is amazing. Serving size is larger than most for the price range so order the half sandwich if you are new to the place and go up from there. Will be returning in the future.,2
"Can't figure out why this place isn't busier the food is excellent, and the prices are low. Love the taro fries and the little coruts they serve as a free appetizier. Rotisserie chicken is a lunch thing, but super tasty and moist. Nice atmosphere and easy parking. The fried seafood assortment is most excellent and the ceviches are super freash and tasty. Don't miss it!",2
"We ordered chili cheese fries, chicken tacos loved , and chicken salad po boy sandwich. All of it was fabulous! Gave them 4 stars not 5 only because the wine wasn't fresh, definitely a day or two old, and the name of the place is Wine 5 Cafe. Wine should be on the top of their priority. nFood was excellent. Fresh, good quality and flavor. Worth checking out!",2
"It really was amazing My son is usually an adventurous eater but he was finding that he didn't like 1 ingredient in each of the offers. He settled for a simple sandwich and loved it! I loved my wraps and coffee. When I ordered the chocolate cake at the end for myself, I knew that my son would probably end up eating most of it. That was the biggest hit We cannot wait to try more!",2
"We have been coming to Benihana for years. But this time we had a horrible experience, we made reservations, then we're told to come back in 30 40 min. When we arrived back in 35 min, our table had already been given up! So yes we did wait for another hour to be seated, and we're so frustrated with the service. I would recommend this restaurant for those who have patients time.",1
"If you're heading to Vegas BABY then this is the place to book. It has it all whether you stay in THE Hotel tower or in the main hotel. The rooms are gorgeous and the location is convenient to the airport. Also, there are complimentary trams to a couple other resorts. But, if you want to stay in one spot, you've got it all here! Vegas Baby!",2
Ambiance is amazing and I would recommend it to all of my friends.and have! The staff is very professional and friendly. They have the best of the best products with the best of the best hair and nail stylist. They even serve wine Their prices are very reasonable and you leave looking and feeling beautiful!,2
"I like the food and the whole fondue experience of the Melting Pot but I give this place only 2 stars because on my last 2 visits, I had experienced terrible service. When I go to a restaurant planning to spend a minimum of 30 per person excluding drinks , I expect a better level of service than I have gotten here from hostesses and wait staff.",1
My guy and I been here lots. Friday night I had mixed vegetables w chicken he had chow mein w steamed tofu.went to sleep both woke up vomiting and extreme diarrhea. We had extreme food poisoning. He had salmonella I had bacteria and parasitic worms.both still not right . obviously this kitchen is cross contamination .we are so done with this place,1
"A great BYOW experience. At Canailles you can enjoy a great meal at a reasonnable price other ""fancy "" BYOBs tend to charge way too much for their entrees . The foie gras burger is to die for. It is a huge hamburger. With a huge piece of foie gras inside the patty. OMG. Quality food, good service, cheap wine, rince, repeat.",2
"Biscuits and gravy were very good. I always prefer drop biscuits, but these were good. The gravy was not too salty. Eileen was the big winner here with the specialty quesadilla which had eggs and chorizo in it with green stuff ok it was guacamole which I don't eat LOL and sour cream on the side. She said it was among the best chorizo she's had high praise indeed. Good coffee too!",2
"I have loves my stay here, room is big, spacious and clean. Good atmosphere at the bar and very warm and comfortable surroundings. Only reason why I haven't given it 5 stars is because I wasn't to impressed with the meal. Chips were well overlooked and the gammon steak was nothing special. I would definatly stay here again I just wouldn't eat here.",2
"Nothing great, but if it is the only place near your hotel, worth a short walk. They do not have almond milk, only soy. The espresso is good, but the drink was tepid and prepared very quickly there was a long line . I would assume under different circumstances not CES , this would be a better stop. Overall an average experience. They did have food and smoothies, but there wasn't much vegan fare.",1
I came in for lunch as I work nearby. The place was clean as far as I could tell but the food was awful. I ordered a teriyaki chicken and shrimp and the shrimp were very small and rubbery that accompanied my chicken pieces of an unknown source on a white bed of rice. Only a few squirts of teriyaki sauce to top it off made the sauce scarce as well. I was very disappointed. Not coming back.,1
"Service is terrible and the food isn't worth the price. If you're going to serve brunch, learn how to make a Caesar and cook eggs in less that 30 mins, especially when the restaurant only has 3 tables occupied. I hate it when I see one server running around trying to do everything while the owner stands behind the bar watching tv. Close your business and sit in your livingroom.",1
"Took a friend from out of town here. Back home, we have Panera, which is similar to this place. Very delicious. Can get a little pricy, but I'll pay it just to eat better food. The butternut squash soup melted in my mouth. The caesar salad was delicious too. If you feel like soup and salad, or sandwich, this is the place to go!",2
"The food here is not particularly good, nor bad enough to make it stand out, other than its enormous hot dog, ""the big unit "". However, the overpriced drinks make it a place you should pre game before you head to for sports viewing. Clearly this place relies on its owner's renown for its reputation and customer base more so than it's ability to be a quality location.",1
"Horrible service. No chips, no service, no nothing. Just waited for 15 minutes. I am so sad that this place has gone down so much. I have never experienced a lack of service as I did today. I do not recommend this location to anyone. Go to another nearby Mexican restaurant maybe you'll at least get noticed there.",1
"As crazy as it sounds to go to a taco place while in Vegas you should give this place a try. It is the best taco outside of Mexico. Take it from me in a professional Mexican. It will be packed so be prepared to wait and one line per meat choice is crazy. Update. Going back to Vegas for Tacos straight from the airport. Gordo, open up a place in the Bay Area.",2
"Jonathan Chao will work hard to earn your business and take care of you. I did quite a bit of comparative shopping, and Jonathan and Prolific were the best combination of personal service and price. He will find a solution to fit your needs, whether high volume or low. If you are shopping for a merchant processor, he is at the very least worth a call.",2
"I've been traveling every week out of Sky Harbor since 2003 and US Airways is my least favorite airline. So many bad experiences, I can't name them all. I hate their change fees, the flight attendants half ass their customer service, a low frequency of flights per day, bad baggage handling experiences, and poor customer service overall. Why is this airline still in business?",1
"All frozen yogurt is not created equal! Yogurtology is THE spot for creamy and non icy froyo in town. Upon talking with them, we found out they make their flavors from scratch, and it shows. The oatmeal cookie flavor is insane, as well as the lemon pound cake, which is often a guest flavor. This is the place you drive out of the way to get your yogurt fix!",2
"One day I walked in and noticed the cook sitting in the dinning area, while I waited to order I notice him dig in his nose, then walk back to the kitchen and didnt wash his hands, I wasnt sure so I walked around to the kitchen to peek in and I was right.I then told the owner and his wife and they made him wash his hands. I walked out.will not be back.",1
"A little pricy for the quality of food you are getting. We ordered Filet Steak Nachos as an appetizer. The nachos came out with just chips, cheese and the steak. Steak was great but the cheese literally tasted like the cheese you'd get out of gas statioachos. But service was good. The two stars is for it being pricy for what you are getting. No restrooms on ground floor. Uh. just not feeling it.",1
"Horrible! We booked through Expedia and when I checked in they didn't have my reservations so they charged my card twice and said one would drop off. While walking to our room there was a girl unconscious and cops were trying to wake her, the hotel smelled like weed, and people were throwing their own parties in the parking lot. One word GHETTO!",1
"Like a lot of other reviewers, did not have a good experience. My meal was delicious. Where things went wrong was service. Server ignored us for a good while. Apps and entrees arrived almost at the same time. After done with entrees, no follow up re do we want anything else, just came over and dropped the check on us.",1
"I like going to Costco Sam's Club whenever I'm traveling just to see how similar different the stores are. This location definitely has better beer wine selections than the few Sam's Clubs near my home in San Bernardino, Ca. Even better is Nevada does not charge a recycling fee so I pay less for bottled water, beer, wine, etc. hence, you bet I loaded up for the trip home.",2
"Good if you like painfully slow service, frozen breaded seafood, and potato soup passed off as clam chowder. This restaurant, while decorated in tacky, outdated marine decor, used to be really great. Disappointed that the place I used to go for a taste of New England ""home "", is now serving overpriced meals with a side of ridiculously slow service.",1
I have used ODS for the last three years and their service has been very good. But twice in the last year someone from there has attempted to steal my credit card info. I have a credit card that I only use for paying for my rides to and from the airport. Twice the day after I have used ODS other charges have shown up on my card. I am done using them as my limo service!,1
"Very good, fast, and different, my wife has visited 8 times at least. I have been here 2 times and thought it deserved to be recognized especially since. I have never seen food sold by the scoop, but it works. Certain things you get huge portions and the other things its the opposite. I still highly recommend it",2
"Great ""social hour "". Good wine for 5 and appetizers for 7 to match. High quality, low cost and cool atmosphere. Bar tenders know what they are talking about and a cool atmosphere. A refreshing treat compared to the hustle bustle and touristy action of the strip. Lobster and corn side is AMAZING. Highly recommend for multiple reasons.",2
"Yuck! Specialty rolls were definitely nothing special. Tasted like a packaged California roll you buy in a grocery store. The 9 short ribs were cold and super salty. When I told the waiter all he said was ""sorry "" and walked off. Maybe the Teppanyaki is better but if you want sushi or hand rolls drive east 10 minutes to Otaku!",1
I thought the food was pretty good for being a restaurant inside an airport. we were happy to find a decent sit down establishment while we waited for our flight. I Had the chicken cobo basically chicken tenders with fries and it was pretty good. I didn't care for the coffee it tasted weired. My wife had the burger which she thought was good.,2
I ordered delivery from this place cause I was craving Italian. I ordered my usual which is eggplant Parmesan. It was 12 and I was so disappointed when i took a look at it. The dinner came with spaghetti which took up more than half the plate. My eggplant Parmesan was so minuscule! The spaghetti itself was bland and mediocre. Wish I got Chinese delivered instead.,1
Went there Saturday for rivalry weekend around noon.great day on the patio. Kids played cornhole and threw the football in the parking lot. Wings are good but get them crispy.fries are very good. Burgers are awful.think one step down from frozen bubba burgers. Get the burgers right and it's a 5 star,2
"Make sure if you go here for an oil change, that your oil cap is on before you leave. I noticed an oil leak after an oil change and found my oil cap laying on top of the motor. I went back again for another oil change, told them what had happened, and to please make sure the cap is replaced. Once again I noticed an oil leak and find the oil cap laying on the motor. Once ok, but twice?",1
"not impressed at all! the food looked like it was sitting out for a while and for the price we paid, it was not worth it 54 for 2 people. the sushi was crap, the mashed potatoes were crap and pretty much everything but the crab legs and shrimp.if i would've known i would have eaten at an all you can est seafood restaurant. if there was an option to rate it a zero then this would be zero.",1
"I don't know if it was the company or the food, but I really enjoyed Fat Heads. I had been wanting to go for so long but no one would go with me! Maybe the name was a little off putting.Either way, I was enticed. They weren't kidding with the serving sizes, the fries were in a glorious deep bowl. I never got to the bottom. I'll get there one day.",2
"Sunrise Coffee is kind of a hipster cafe that we see in San Francisco or Portland. That was the first thing we missed when we moved to Las Vegas, but with Sunrise and Sambalatte, no longer. We just need more places like this, but I'm sure Sunrise Coffee will thrive in this caffeinated modern times of laptop generations.",2
"As if MSN wasn't easy enough to deal with they now have TSA PreCheck. Nice amenities include the Great Dane Brewpub, Ancora Coffee, the greeters lounge. Delta is the most reliable in my opinion as they run mainline jets most of the time. Some great nonstop destinations are making the airport more attractive and competitive. A nice alternative to big city airports with a few big city touches.",2
I stayed in the courtyard rooms on the highway side and had four or five unwanted guests. Cockroaches. Management did not call me back after I complained. Will not stay in the courtyard rooms again. The tower rooms are very nice. The Oyster bar is one of the best. The food overall at all the restaurants here including room service food is very good.,1
I was a fan of this place before they moved but the new location is very tiny and they've done away with a lot of the tasty sugar free treats I used to love. Now there's only a tiny section of pre made and packaged SF sweets. I went in a couple of days ago and left. Nothing very appealing. A huge bummer!,1
"My flight was cancelled and had to stay. They offered a ""distressed rate "" and the staff was nice and friendly. However the rooms are from the 1980's. The furniture looks like it belongs n a Motel Six. The carpets are frayed, the walls and doors are beat up, the hallway carpets are ieed of replacing. Upper management should be ashamed to have not upgraded the rooms years ago.",1
"They have changed their plans since I started going. They no longer offer unlimited guest passes, freedom to go to both locations or the classes with the 20 a month plan. Will be looking elsewhere at my year end. I had to pay 120 enrollment fee and a 39 annual fee when I signed up and that is the only reason I'm staying for the full year.",1
"Forget the buffets. I come here every time I'm in Vegas. It's ultimate Korean comfort food and SO PERFECT for when I'm hungover cough. I mean. sick . Very traditional Korean fare, please do everyone a favor and don't get the BBQ hubs likes it okay but its not great , just stick to what they do best the SOUP. and the kimchi, but that's free ",2
"I wish i could actually give this place a better review. Food was good, but not great enough to have such bad service. It may very likely be the night I went, but no one seemed to apologize for long waits and missing our reservation for over 2 hours. Bar gets 5 starts though. Great wine by the glass list.",1
"I expect long lines and a wait. It is the post office right? It is the rudeness and obvious unhappy staff that is just unacceptable. The way the postal workers speak to individuals is really appalling. The gray hair man with glasses actually yelled ""There is no one at that window! Get in line! "" He barked this to a nice woman in her 50's. This lack of respect and bad attitude is not acceptable.",1
OMG.what a ripoff. There is an 'inside' and an 'outside' ride. We happened to choose the one outside. We stood in line longer than the actual 12 minute ride in one tunnel and out the other. my husband burst out laughing when he saw that we were immediately making a circle back. I would feel guilty if i didn't warn people to 'save your money'. i'm all for romance but this was laughable.,1
"Watch your step. Really. You trip in to the door, trip from room to room, and trip over items spewn over the floor. How they get insurance is beyond me. The items are housewares lots , jewelry, coins, and some military. One room had a selection of mid century furniture, but rough. There is little to no air conditioning, so consider this when the outside temps are above 90.",1
"Went here yesterday for lunch, it was quiet so expected good speedy service. nNope! sat for 15 mins before we got our order in, 2 drinks and a chicken enchilada appetizer to share. Food was bland, drinks were okay but expensive. 50 for a drink and an appetizer? go elsewhere, this place is terribly expensive, bad service and not worth the price",1
"I took my two nephews here for dinner before heading back to Texas. I ordered the Oolong Sea Bass, which was stellar, as always. One of my nephews got it too, and loved it. The lettuce wraps were very good however, the portions seem to have shrunk, as there wasn't much filling on the plate. The service was very, very good.",2
crappy food terrible service! the food sucked and the waiter was rude! dont go here unless you like to waste your money and hang out at a loud place! expensive food thats not worth it! ripp off they tried to sit me and my family in a 2 seat chair and we had 4 people! i had to ask 2 times for a booth and they were like trying to push the chairs on me! wth an,1
Jim Beam Honey Ginger Ale is delicious and People's Porter for 3 was awesome. Bacon wrapped figs Yummy. Shrimp Grits and blackened grilled salmon was very good. For a 4th of July buzz there wasn't a huge crowd at 6pm but I expected a bigger crown. Our waiter was unique in a good way. He was very attractive and attentive. He knew the menu and offered suggestions.,2
After reading the bad reviews about service at the Daily Dose I was still willing to go for lunch today to try out the food. Excellent decision. We had good service and my banana bread French toast was so good. The waitress did refill our drinks and check on us during the busy lunch rush. There was a mistake on the check that was fixed immediately. I will be back.,2
"It would be hard to wax lyrically about the food at the Huether because it takes far too long for the food to come. If we weren't celebrating a birthday we would have left. Seriously doubting a return visit. Perhaps they need a bigger kitchen or serve fewer people. In any case it's been an hour, it's Friday night and our appetizer hasn't made it to the table.",1
"I travel to NY, San Fran, LA and Houston and this is the best Columbian food I've found no offense but who would really expect that in a Suburb of Charlotte . Got the chicken with a mustard like cream sauce on it. Fantastic! Fried cheesecake.amazing! Sour sop juice to drink.heaven. Just go there and you will write a review like this as well.",2
"I can describe my family's meal with one word yuck. My wife ordered the ""Sunday chicken special "", which had the odd characteristic of appearing fried and crunchy, but in actuality it was soft and gooey leaving me to deduce that it was microwaved . My burger was so charred and tasteless, that it resembled a hockey puck. The only benefit was that our waitress was very courteous.",1
Leah is awesome! Just took our dog rescued 7 year old Rottweiler mix last night for her first session to help with fearful aggression and Leah gave us so much hope that we are going to be able to get this issue under control. She gave us sooo much useful information that we can use for all 3 of our dogs. I can't wait to practice at home with our dogs!,2
"Love the vibe, be ready for a heart attack. The food is ridiculously rich. Everything is piled with foie gras if they can. Loved the energy and vibe of the place and the beautiful crowd. Interesting experience but I probably wouldn't return. Perhaps more to protect my poor heart for having to breathe through all the clogged arteries.",2
Dined here twice. Both times the bar tenders were awesome. Both times the food was exceptional. For some reason our waitress was not very good on our second visit. Just not attentive or what I would expect for this level of restaurant. Not horrible just not great. The steak is absolutely amazing. Will definitely return. This is our new fav steak spot.,2
"The atmosphere and service are stellar with an amazing wine selection. Then when you get incredible beef tartar, A5 steak that melts in your mouth and the most delicious brussel sprouts you are in food heaven. Top it off with delicious deserts that are equally unique and beautiful as the entire experience.",2
This is more to Savers Value Village as a corp. I have shopped these stores most of my life. I love the deal hunt and these stores are always full of wonderful old and new treasures. However recently the prices have been bordered on highway robbery. A second hand store should not have jeans for 20 or shoes for 30 regardless the brand.,1
Passed this place as it was closed to our hotel and there was often a queue outside. Visited them on a quiet early afternoon for lunch. Ended up for a revisit a few days later it's worth a few minutes queuing. And there's a designated and quicker shorter queue for cold stuff like their delicious shakes,2
One of my favorites. Great beer selection that always changes. Servers and bartenders are very friendly and know their beer. Pizza is wonderful too. I recommend the Heart Stopper lots of meat! Only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars are the Friday nights being overrun by children. Wait until after 8 to go.,2
Lots of options you can order your creation as a salad or a wrap. They also have a good selection of paninis which I enjoyed. I thought the paninis and wraps were pretty cheap 6.99 but the salads were a touch expensive 7.99 for a small and 8.99 for a large. Positive note The service was excellent friendly and helpful.,1
"Yelpers you got this one wrong We got take out after we read all the great yelp reviews. We were pretty disappointed, the Tom khar soup lacked flavor and had a strange after taste, the Thai beef salad was greasy and had many fatty pieces and the massman curry was very runny. We will stick Panna Thai.",1
"I'm a regular at this Starbucks. Never had a bad experience. Always a solid product, the staff, especially the young redhead, has been terrific. No caffeine coffeehouse airs here. Plenty of seating inside plus a large wooden table and comfy chairs. A number of tables outside perfect for me my iPad and a tall cold ice tea. Free wi fi.",2
"I've been going to Mountainside at the Ice Den since they opened. Everyone is always friendly and helpful. The manager, Ralph, is especially friendly and seems to have a great rapport with his staff and the members. I also have used Steve for personal training and the experience was great! I like the small size of the gym as it isn't overwhelming.",2
One of my favorite happy hour spots. Half off drinks and selected appetizers with a pretty quality beer selection. Have eaten in the restaurant for a few work functions. Food is good but the prices are a little steep. Highly recommend the bar and happy hour. Great atmosphere and the music on Fridays and Saturdays are awesome.,2
"First impression ohmygosh it smells so good! After that though, I wasn't very impressed. The food was good, but they were out of several options on the buffet, some of the foods were clearly not freshly prepared, and I didn't get the impression that cleanliness mattered much to them. We tried really hard to like David's, but I can't give more than two stars.",1
"Perhaps the nicest place I have ever stayed at. nWe stayed there the night of our wedding, before we headed to the airport in the morning for our honeymoon. I don't know where to start, this place is overall phenomenal. We were treated like royalty the whole time and we had the best service imaginable.",2
"Bad food, expensive, not worth the money. I got a to go of falafel starter and 2 chicken combo platter, and i regret spending 35 on this tasteless meal. The pita bread was cold and i opened up the box 5 minutes after getting the food. Will prefer Greek Wraps King Gyros to this place which are economical and tasty.",1
"You can't beat the view from the rooftop! Day or night, nothing compares. The cocktail servers are all beautiful girls but give excellent guest service and everything that's served is top quality. I normally go there at night because I love the inspirational lights from the strip and of it still feel like partying I can head downstairs to Drais afterhours till the sun comes up. Eek! So fun!",2
"Took 30 minutes to get our drinks and still had to wait another 10 additional minutes for our waters. When we asked for a lemon for a drink, the the waiter came back with a whole bowl of lemons to be rude. When they finally came out with waters and the bus boy asked if we wanted straws, someone replied yes, he threw 10 straws on the table. Customer service has been awful and I would not return.",1
"This review is for their to go service. I called in an order when I was feeling under the weather and not only was it done super quick, the pad thai lasted me three meals! Ping Pong is conveniently located off of Sunset and close to the airport so its perfect for grabbing a late night snack on the way home.",2
"Placed an order for delivery, an hour and fourty minutes later no show. so i called to complain the guy told me the guy already left just when i was going to ask a question he hung up me how rude! Another 35 minutes passes and agaio show .so i called again to complain and this time he told me he didnt have my Phone number the driver got lost so he couldnt call us for directions.",1
"Love the Gyro and come often. They know my order and their Gyro is perfect I go light on the onions though . Love the soft pita bread and the side salad is good, too zesty dressing! . I haven't tried anything else except the shawarma which I didn't care for, oh and the baklava not so great, kinda soggy. mines better! . Friendly staff and the place is nice and clean.",2
"On the scale of 1 to 5 spiciness, the 5 was just right. My lips are numb and my head has a mild buzz. The food was great. The ambience and location is fantastic. I ate at the bar and the bartender waitress was great. I didn't take them up on the free hugs prize for checking in, it was going to come from a kitchen staff and I wasn't sure what I was going to get.",2
Awful. this is the worst Cirque show. The only cool part is they showever before seen pictures of Elvis. Other than that it is a bunch of stupid dancing and nothing spectacular that normal shows give you. Go see LOVE instead. Or Zumanity. Or Absinthe not a cirque owned show but still by far one of the best ,1
It was my first time at First Friday last night. It was awesome cause I was with the Yelp izzles! I saw some great art and very diverse crowd. The last thing I expected to see here was all the little raver kids. I got to hit up the Slider Truck and a couple beer stands. Saw some b boys doin their thang. Cool first First Friday for me.,2
"A consistently great place, and one of the few I've found that actually does the deep fried rolls correctly. The staff are excellent and give superb service, and the sushi chefs fun to be around and most skilled in their art. Just wish they stayed open later than 9pm on the weekend, but other than that small quibble I've always been pleased when I've been there.",2
"Great family owned Italian restaurant. Don't expect much from the decor. Small and only has 8 tables. The food is all homemade and incredible. Southern Italy style cooking. The restaurant is BYOB , which is easy because there is a Wine and Spirits store right next door. One of the few restaurants in Pittsburgh that serve TRIPE. Bonus points for that.",2
"Fatburger wouldn't be my first choice for lunch. First of all, the burger is kind of expensive. Secondly, it's not that great. Although, it looks delicious. When I went in all I wanted was a cheeseburger with the works. I felt like I was signing up for life insurance. They kept bombarding me questions. Just do it right and stop making things so complicated. It's supposed to be fast food.",1
"Sadly ""Big Jim "" poorly represents the company. I was excited to do vinyl lettering on my vehicle to start my business and while waiting for the lettering to come in, I came into the funds for a vehicle wrap. I went back 6 days after paying to upgrade the order and he had never processed my request for vinyl lettering and was rude to me so I got a refund and took my business elsewhere.",1
"Nice big, clean, store of moderate upscale feel with wide, uncramped aisles. Quiet and pleasant on all occasions I've been there, though at somewhat ""off "" hours. Deli counter, in house bakery, pharmacy, US Bank, and Starbucks. Personable early morning Starbucks gal much appreciated! Store staff always helpful when asked. Some friendly, some perfunctory, but never rude. Good produce.",2
"Oh man this was good. I ordered the seafood enchiladas. which honestly were nothing like an enchilada, but it was delicious anyway. One of the best means of my trip to Scottsdale recently. My girlfriend had the veggie quesedilla, which was OK, but not spectactular. I would order the seafood enchiladas any day of the week, and I look forward to going back for them.",2
I ordered delivery through eat24 tonight and ordered the tofu pad Thai along with an order of cashew nut chicken. I was surprised to find out that the cashew nut chicken doesn't come with rice and it does not state on the menu that you need to order rice separately so now I'm stuck with a dish and no rice. Super disappointed and will not be ordering again from here. Taste is ok on the pad Thai.,1
"Terrible service. We had to wait over 20 minutes just to get drinks and don't even get me started on how long it took to get food. I have an idea lets have more than 1 waiter working on a Saturday night. Food was underwhelming to say the least. We ordered the ""jumbo "" crab cakes and they were the size of a quarter.",1
Hands down the best coffee around! I actually go out of my way to get coffee at Matador coffee. My husband and I also keep a good stash of Matador coffee beans stocked up at home and caot live a single day without having an amazing cup of joe or an espresso. If you are a coffee connoisseur then this coffee is for you! I Highly recommend Matador Coffee!,2
"An eclectic mix of hip hop, electronica, rock, and a high school physics class, this show is a lot of fun and more or less family friendly. The dancers were amazing and involved the audience frequently. It's hard not to get into the show and start dancing or attempt to at least . It's also a great bargain and there are no bad seats in their new theater.",2
I have probably left my dogs here around 4 5 times and everytime I get them out of the car to go in they act like sled dogs pulling me in to the doors.this is usually a good sign that they are fans as well. Cost effective compared to every other kennel I have called or experienced and the owners are very nice helpful. Also they have cameras set up so if you want to check on the website you can.,2
"Such a cool little market. This is a must do if you are in the area while visiting Pittsburgh. You don't need to allocate a lot of time for this stop, maybe 15 minutes. Just enough time to walk through the store and check it out. It's part of the culture and it's the kind of place we would be regulars at if we lived in that neighborhood.",2
"Overrated, at best. I was sober when I ate their pizza, so perhaps this influenced my perception of it. Unlike most of their patrons, I wasn't famished and drunk. The pizza was really greasy and didn't have that much flavor. Some of the crust was good, but it was really similar to Sbarro at the mall. It is fine if you want to eat for 5, but I wouldn't make any special trips to this place.",1
"Food is good and for sushi lovers it is somewhere to check off your list but, for the price I expected more, a lot more. The reason for only two stars is the servers are rude and arrogant when I asked if they had the real wasabi root and if I could have a side the waiter asked me if I would like ketchup with it as well. Not sure why the attitude over a simple question and a common request.",1
i got band from goretorium face book page for a bad review i gave about what a rip off it is and only a handful of actors left since openning. nnot worth the 30 dollars and at 15.00 a drink very small i wouldn't recomend this venue to anyone who is into horror terror. ni would be interested in buying some of the props when they close.,1
"We were offered a free upgrade at check in, which really set our experience off to a great start. The dealers were delightful, even helping out a new gambler like me with tips and tricks! The overall feel to this casino was as classy as it gets and I will be going back. Would have loved to be able to see more of PURE it was only partially open on Sunday .",2
Because it's free it's helpful. But the routes are to long and winding. One gets car sick. The ride is rough and the windows constant loud rattling is insane. Routes stop to early for most during the heat season. Paying even.25 for this service as irecently propsed is in general a waste of money for most.,1
"I have been using this club since it opened. I swim and use the locker room. My only complaint is that they do not know how to clean the tile floors. I see the cleaning person with a string mop, which is basically just spreading dirty water over the floor. The floors are ieed of professional steam cleaning.",2
I never write reviews on anything but had to share my opinion on this place. The food was so bad. The fish was not fresh at all. I felt like I had overpaid for the little food we ordered. The only good thing was we were not charged for all the uneaten sushi on the AYCE. I would not go back even if it was free.,1
"Service is aweful. We were waiting for 15 minutes for somebody to come to take our order while they were not even busy! I regret we didn't leave then because the food was not good at all. The smoke fish salad was the worst! And it's all overpriced. I thinj it's a good venue for the concert or couple drinks, but not to get food.",1
"This place is doap. Sm Saimin is big enuf for this tall drink of water, and the aloha special spam, sausage and more sausage, with two eggs and rice is 6.50 and is pretty good. I mean, its hard to screw that up. But yeah basically, this little gem is tucked away above the diner that serves oxtail soup, so most miss it. But its nice. Not amazing but better than most.",2
Erickberto's is a nice eat in take out style Mexican restaurant on the border of Mesa and Apache Junction. Their lengua tongue is very good. The lengua burrito is delicious and cheap. The adobada and green chile are good too. So are the enchiladas. Their red sauce is not watered down like some other places. A nice family owned Mexican restaurant.,2
"A friend took me today as a birthday gift. Tnx dan. nIt was fun on a bun from the first minute. The wether was perfect, everyone were nice. The guide was extremely nice knowledgeable. He took us to eigjt places. Everybody got plenty of fish. He even thought us a new way of fishing. The 4 hours just flew by. Tnx, definitely will come back.",2
"Visited 04 07 12. WINNING! Who needs Jack in the Box after hours when you've got Earl of Sandwich. Delicious, good prices open TWENTY FOUR SEVEN! I am not a fan of hot subs and seeing as though it was about 3 or 4 in the morning I forgot to mention to them not to heat mines up and it was still SOOO good! long line but not a dreadful wait.",2
"StripSteak it seems to cater to the Young, Hip Crowd, however, all are welcome! Loved it! My steak was sooooooo good, sooo yummy. the Cabernet I had definitely complimented my Filet. Hands down, great, great steak! It is in the Mandalay Bay I do have to say if you're sitting by the door it can be a little noisy. oooohhhhh, but I must mention the Burrata Cheese. to die for!",2
"Went tonight with some coworkers to get piercings on a spur of the moment kind of thing meaning sitting in a bar and making hasty decisions! . Staff here is super friendly and super helpful! Such a great experience. After speaking to one of the tattoo artists there, I'll definitely be back for more work.",2
"I'm no expert on authentic Vietnamese cuisine, I just like what I like and I know when I like it. Let me remind you that this place is located in Surprise AZ. Your typical fare here is Chicken wings and burgers. I would say that no pho is terrible if the bean sprouts are crunchy, the cilantro is fresh and clean, and if the broth is hot enough to make you sweat like like a priest in a comic shop.",2
"I love Kabob G. I've really never had anything that I've disliked there the house dressing is delicious, love the Tabboolee, Falfel sandwich is great, I get the vegetarian grape leaves a lot and love them too! nThe waitress is funny and remembers who I am and my boyfriend and always knows what we want. I'm able to walk there but I can see that parking might be an issue for some people.",2
"We were not in the mood for a fancy dinner, but we did want to find a place that was not gimmicky or kitschy. This fit the bill perfectly. The bartender makes a great dirty martini and my vegan selection was terrific. Ask for Jennifer as your waiter, as she is smart, cheery without being overly familiar, and made very good suggestions for entrees",2
I bought a living social deal in July for the Nail persoamed Gary. I could not get an appt until January the guy was very rude on the phone and the prices are way too high. I got a refund because he wouldn't change my appt. I would stay away from here if this is how they go about getting new clients.,1
Been here about 4x now close to my work. I had heard they had fantastic tacos and they DO. Love the blend of Mexican Korean fusion. Flavors are awesome. Go try it out you won't be disappointed and you can walk out for less than 10. I keep going back to tacos had the burrito once. Bulgogi tacos so good. Service for the limited staff just excellent they take care of you.,2
Another example that you can get great food in Las Vegas. Brought my family to Argana with 6 and 11 year olds. We all loved it. We got there at opening. Service was great. Started with every appetizer to get a tasting. That would have probably been enough food for dinner. The flavors are amazing. We live in the SF Bay Area and have yet to find a Moroccan restaurant with food this good.,2
"I went here based on the yelp reviews. Well.yelp you have let me down again. This place is expensive and bland there are so many places that are cheaper and way better that are locally owned St. Francis . It was loud, the service was slow, hardly any beer selection and the fish was marginal and farm raised. Go somewhere else.save your money.",1
"Amelie's is really going downhill . We used to adore this place . Food quality, service, understaffed you say it it is gone down . Maybe ego is the issue maybe time for them to get a competitor so they care again. Only reason for two stars is some pastries are still yummy . My chai latte was water downed yuck!",1
Just as I expected. Pathetic low ball sckank guy. Acts like he knows everything. Was going to give me 500 for 2 amazing bedroom sets. One is Bennington Pine.6 piece Queen Poster bed.excellent condition. The other solid mahonogy. 8 piece.circa 1950. Seriously? I could get more donating it! DO NOT DEAL WITH THESE RIP OFF SKANKS!,1
My husband and I had an early Sunday and decided to try Phx Public Market. It was a horrible. They were not ready for early customers we sat at the bar and had to ask if they were serving drinks after 15 mins no one even said hello. Our waitress order taker forgot what I ordered her one job . We got the Churchill is was subpar I do not recommend this place especially early on the morning.,1
Roberto's was definitely a winner in my book. I'm from San Diego where I grew up on Mexican food. The facilities inside were very clean and that's always a plus. I ordered the carne asada fries and 5 rolled tacos. I would recommend both and come back to order both. I'm a fan and would come back when I need my authentic Mexican food fix.,2
Went in Sunday because my regular place was swamped. Thought this would be a good choice because closer to home. Went and they were not very busy should have been a clue and only had a pedicure. Worst one I have ever had. Polish on one toe was coming off with 3 hours. Ill wait for my old salon to have an opening next time. Tech seemed bothered by having to do a pedicure while soccer was on.,1
"This is one of the best nightclubs in Vegas. We went on a Friday night and it was packed. I would definitely recommend buying tickets in advance online to avoid the long line. Pros They have two different floors, lower floor is a little more chill and not as crowded. Cons definitely very pricey, especially for guys, upper level was insanely crowded.",2
"Atmosphere is fun and inviting. Was very busy when I went and was seated in 20 min. Great service, great energy. This place does NOT skimp on the drinks. Had one drink an was feelin it. Service was good but could be faster. That's why it gets 4 stars. But entertainment was fun and music keeps the restaurant together it feels like.good playlist. Will be back here!",2
"My 3rd trip in 2 weeks. The BEST Sandwich yet. I had a 11 University.with Ham, Roast Beef, and Turkey. Add the peppers, and avocado to it.MMM. If you're a carnivore you'll like this place. They pile the meat high. Since the most expensive sandwich is 6 w tax they're a GREAT DEAL! Think of what it would cost for triple meat at subway.",2
"Best indian restaurant i have ever had! Being indian i am very picky And know what good indian food is. This place has exceptional service and the menu has options for everyone vegan, vegetarians, meatatarians, and even halal options. On the downside, I would not reccomend this place on a busy Friday or Saturday night because they are usually understaffed.",2
"1. They sat me right away. n2. Service was excellent. n3. Waiters made drinks on point. n4. Food came out on time. n5. Food was acctually hot. burned tounge on fries. n6. My drink never was empty. they refilled it consistantly. n7. price was decent. n8. energetic staff. n9. desert was awesome n10. lastly, fish n chip ladies and gentlemen. Fish n Chips",2
"A good place to go to get out of the venetian for some mexican food. Had the guacamole and queso dip for the chips. Apparently we had too much dishes and a table meant for 4 seating 6, so things were a bit tight. I had the Isla Asada which was an asada steak served with some vegetable sides. Pretty much a steak fajita with meat that has not been precut.",2
Brought my friend in who has a very bad gluten allergy to wheat. He wanted to try a burger wrapped in romaine lettuce. YOU REFUSED TO DO A SIMPLE THING AS WRAP A BURGER IN ROMAINE? You add bread crumbs to your meat patties and bread your french frys in wheat breading? Walked out because of your unwillingness to bring one piece of romaine lettuce on the side. Drop the attitude it's not pretty.,1
"I was recommended Adam to paint the exterior of my house and was not let down. I received other quotes and Adam's quote was right there at the bottom for pricing but.that lower price didn't reflect in his work. The work was great, fast and they cleaned up well afterwards. I did my homework before choosing Life in Color and I would definitely recommend them.",2
"I ordered the buffalo wings, Shrimp Po Boy and gumbo. 1. Was only fried chicken with a tabasco sauce. n2. Shrimp Po Boy was good. Nothing special. n3. Gumbo was so salty I was afraid my ankles were going to start swelling. Even the pasta salad that my co worker got was so salty that he asked to change it with a veggie burger.",1
"Went on a Saturday night between 5 and 6. The ambiance and seating are nice the decor is very inviting. The staff, not so much. You would think they would have someone working the floor if you have so much seating but alas, no. The bartenders, when flagged down, made adequate drinks. I think if there was a change in the staff and they put staff on the floor it could be much better.",1
"Not a bad place, service was good. Price seemed a bit high for what it was, I had the gyro pita which only had 4 slices of gyro meat on it. Pita bread was delicious. Parking can be a bit chaotic, but they have an attendant to help guide you and manage the flow. Inside feels a bit cramped for me, but it also seems like they do a decent carry out business.",1
"Came here last night, had about a 20 min wait. well worth it! Crablegs were plentiful, and all of the buffet items were full and very hot! This place is better than pacific, doesnt have all of the items of pacific, but they dont ration out the crablegs , and the food items they do have are better tasting! And the dinner price is 12.95!",2
"One of my favorite post hangover spots in Scottsdale. It's really close to home, dark, chill, and they have great weekend specials. I usually go for the Avacado BLT or the Jalape u00f1o Burger. The service is good, TV's are everywhere, and their diet cokes are massive! All Zipps are good, this one is great!",2
"Black Cod Miso. That is all that I really need to say, but I will continue. AMAZING. Just melts in your mouth and was so tasty! We also tried the sashimi plate and was greeted with very fresh sashimi. The place is modern and decorated nicely. Great Ambiance! The service was wonderful too. Again. Black Cod Miso.",2
"This place makes me hate Mexican food. Everything is fried. bland and gross. Don't expect to leave without adding 2,000 calories to your daily diet. I know that other people have raved about their 2 beer happy hours. This place is right off Mill Ave! There are better happy hours and better beers all around Mill! This place is the McDonald's in the ghetto version of a Mexican restaurant.",1
i'm no pho expert but theirs was sooooo goood.i almost got a second order to go.broth was super flavorful even before i added my favorite condiments.someone said their noodles were all stuck together but all you have to do is give it a quick stir with your chopsticks and they're all separated and waiting to be slurped up! can't wait to go back.wish they were open late night too. YUMMY!,2
"Was shocked.where can you go and get a 10 "" personal pizza and a drink for 6.50? I have yet to know a place. Dough has a very fresh taste, as in it tastes natural and not loaded down with ""stuff. "" Great food and very friendly staff and owner. We'll be back for sure! Our group got 2 26 "" pizzas and lots of wings.all well priced! Thanks!",2
"This place is great! You fill your bowl with raw meat, vegetables, noodles and sauce they cook it for you, and you can fill up on sides like soup, rice, crispy wonton chips and more! Location isn't great, and the dining room is a tight squeeze, but the staff is great and more than willing to help out with whatever you need! Be sure to go at dinner for the ""prime "" offerings!",2
"They have a daily special of rice, bread flat bread , and 3 curries. It's just a little hole in the wall with a small lunch line style counter. Great flavor! In all 3 curries. The guy next to me got a gyro and it looked great. If the place had any kind on dining area, ambience, or more than 1 guy serving everybody.it would rule the street. But the line out the door proves they probably do.",2
"Had an opportunity to try a Pasty for lunch and I'll give it a 4 only because at the price it's not the best value around but well prepared shepherd's pie had good ingredients and overall I wish I didn't split it with a friend as I could have eaten the entire pasty for a a hearty filling lunch, next time order two and split them for a variety pack.",2
"The sales staff must be paid on commission here because they will not leave you alone.EVER! I think if I told them I was contagious they would still fight over who got to ""help "" me shop. I am an independent shopper.if I want help than I will ask, but usually I just want to shop on my own. To over priced and annoying for me to come in again.",1
"Went there for my father's 80th birthday. Excellent. My parents both ordered the fillet mignon, which was very flavorful. The butter on top helps. I got the fillet medallions. I found the sauce and crust to be slightly too overpowering on the fillet, but it was still very good. Our waiter, Frank, was very personable and made us feel right at home.",2
Great store. I'm here probably 2 3 times a week. I never have to wait more than just a minute to get checked out even on Double Ad Wednesdays. I'd like a little more variety in the pre made meals and meat section especially the house made sausages but it's not bad. The produce section is usually a bit insane but at least we're all eating our fruits and veggies!,2
"I won't be back. The burger was OK, I would rather have a I out burger across the street my son got the fried pickles and they were terrible. I got the Fried veggies and the portion size was comical for the 3 they charged me. nOverall, it is overpriced and not very good. nGo across the street to In N Out, you will have a better meal and pay half the .",1
"I dined here yesterday because it was one of the many restaurants participating in ""Charlotte Restaurant Week "". For 30 dollars, a person can get an appetizer, main course and dessert. My waitress was excellent and helpful. Food was great and the wait wasn't too long. A good place to go for a date if you're feel like splurging.",2
"Best Indian food in the Valley as far as I'm concerned. The service has always been beyond terrific and the food is awesome. I really can't say anything bad about The Dhaba. Well, once the rice was overcooked, but it was just once. It's also a great place for families.they always treat our daughter like a grandkid when we're there.",2
"Ok so I give this a four out of five. I was trying so hard to give it a five, but nothing here really blew me out of the water. However this place has good thai food, great service, and a cool atmosphere. I will always come back here and enjoy some curry. This is definitely one of the better ones that I have found around town.",2
"Second visit,both with similar results.Latest following a Packer game with late NFL games on TV. This sports bar had a rugby REPLAY on with volume. When asked for NFL was seemingly a bother to bartender,not to mention taking n beer order too! Other places in Verona with better more friendly service.Will be my last visit.",1
"Went to Tacos Jaliscos today and ordered Pozole. Was told they were out of it. So I ordered the tacos at 1 each. I ordered 2 de pastor and 2 of lengua. I must say that they were not fresh at all and they did have a TON of cilantro and onion mix on there. I really didn't like the tacos. Now, the drink place next door is really good. Probably won't return unless I try the Pozole.",1
"Andrew J. and I grabbed boba here before driving back to the OC. This was good stuff! I must admit, I was a skeptic I almost laughed at the idea of getting boba in LV at first.but now I know. The pearls were QQ rather than soft and mushy, and the tea regular milk tea was flavorful, with the perfect amount of sweetness and creaminess. I'll be stopping here each time I visit LV now ",2
We arrived in Las Vegas on a red eye flight the shuttle to the rental car location was quick and pretty painless. The Hertz rental process was easy and quick. We were upgraded to a Mustang Convertible at no additional cost! Really a fun car to have in Vegas! Return was just as easy as the pick up. Would definitely rend from them again!,2
"I do not understand the great reviews of this place. If your namesake is ""Biscuits "", maybe you should do those exceptionally well? Or at least modestly well? The biscuits were small, terrible, expensive and slow to arrive. The rest of breakfast wasn't great either. The waitress was clueless to the menu items.",1
Some people deem this restaurant the best for Thai food in the world. I wouldn't go that far as I have had my fair share across the globe but it is definitely one of the better restaurants in Vegas for Thai. The location is far from exceptional but the staff is friendly and the food is extraordinary. If you come on a weekend without a reservation be prepared for an extreme wait time.,2
"My one stop place for the perfect aperitif with friends. Saucisson and p u00e2t u00e9s are excellent, interesting rotating selection of cheese from Quebec, perfect cherry tomatoes and out of this world bread. Seriously, Lawrence's house bread beats Joe La Cro u00fbte, Guillaume and the likes. Obviously you can also buy meat there, even the unusual cuts, at a fair price. Strongly recommended!",2
"If you've ever been to Light at Bellagio, then this place is EXACTLY the same. Nothing different. I believe they were built by the same company. Go figure. The layout of the place is identical. Just one main dancefloor in the middle of the place, and a walkway that goes around the area. Bars on either side. Plain and simple. Nothing special, nothing more. I'd go to Tao or Tryst instead.",1
"i bought a 1999 honda shadow ace. i called for honda serviceing . they refused,said my bike was tooooooooo oldddd! they recomended me to a mexican guy two miles away. who charged me 184.00 for parts he said he was ordering from apache honda. then he charged me for 4 hours of labor at 240.00. ! they both burned me , never again .",1
They don't even deserve a single star! 4 hours late and no return call after having first been hung up on and then two other attempts. Home office didn't answer and couldn't leave a message because their mailbox was full. Called another mover! If you want good prompt service call moveaholics. http www.moveaholics.net n480 305 3793,1
"I finally caught up with these guys at the phoenix market. I really love the soft flat bread they use as buns, its wonderful. And the owner, couldn't be nicer. My experience was really a positive one. The dog I had with the mango chutney on it was great, the one with blue cheese, cole slaw, and barbecue sauce was surprisingly good as well. I hope to catch them at shadys in the future!",2
"great breakfast brunch. French toast is really really good. Western omelet also very good . better than others I've tried. CLEAN. 100 restaurant inspection when we visited .you almost never see that! Prompt attentive service, personable manager. Even tho very busy our order did not take long. Will definitely be back.",2
"This place definitely needs some work. The service was great, the one thing I really had an issue with was the quality of the food. I ordered a sandwich from this Ihop location and what I got was a soggy mess. I couldn't even finish it since there it was literally unappetizing. Worst 10 I've ever spent.",1
"This Emergency Room is the worst. The registrars are sitting behind their desks gossiping about patients. Security is standing around laughing at the gossip. Heartless and brutal. Patients are sitting in the lobby, moaning and groaning. Why sign up for a job that puts you in a position to genuinely help and care over people if it's clearly the bane of your existence? WhereIsTheLove",1
Italian hero was decent but probably wouldn't come back for it. The pasta salad was old and some of the pasta was starting to get hard. No bueno. Overall I'd say they are coming up short in too many levels. If you want a real Italian deli go to Niccolis not too far from here. They have one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!,1
"Good quality steak dinner with excellent waiter ""theatre "" service. nNot sure about the sommelier from Yorkshire, England. Had a strange attitude towards the diners. We had our salad prepared at the table, you get to choose the ingredients. Try the Filet with prawns if you struggle with 16oz steaks. Good night out for a group. Look forward to going back one day.",2
"Over 200 25 resort fee a night and the rooms have 10 year old Phillips 32 inch tvs, this is listed as 4 star? Motel 6 switch on ac, no thermostat, closet is so small that my hanging shirts are touching the ground. A 15.00 Denver omlette that doesn't come with cheese. This is my first two hours at Treasure Island.",1
"I am only commenting on the food. Was there when they opened, we spent my father's 70th birthday there. I was born and spent 18 years in Germany. The food they are rolling out now does not resemble what they originally served. They have figured out that they can save money serving subpar food to Ami's who have had too much to drink. So sad, will never step foot in their overpriced establishment.",1
I know for a fact that most people will say why would I give it four stars. I just can't give this part of town three. Im not a trendy person and I don't let old things make me thing its no good. I had a good time playing the games and the price of food is like being at home. Alot less people and cheaper things to do is why i like part of town.,2
"I have been going to this nail spa on my many visits to Las Vegas. It is close to our vacation home. I recently became a full time resident. After having 2 very bad experiences elsewhere in the Henderson area, I returned to my favorite place and got the best mani pedi I have ever had. Clean, very friendly and great prices. Can't beat this place. I highly recommend Boulder Nail Spa.",2
This was the first time I had left my puppies anywhere. It was a bit emotional for me but the girls who work there made me feel I wasn't being neurotic. My husband on the other hand. Max and Lil Bit stayed for a couple nights and would totally bring them back again. They had a smaller kennels in the puppy room. I paid extra for some play time outside and both dogs seem like they had a good time.,2
"I have ordered a couple things off the menu that were okay, but the only thing i go here for is the tofu soup. I really think they have the best tofu soup and at a reasonble price. They have pretty good side dishes and great iced barley tea. All that combined with my tofu soup.i am one happy camper.",2
We needed the inside of our new home completely painted. We were extremely pleased by the work done by Michael and his team. They did exactly what they had committed to in the time they said it would take. The finish product is wonderful. I would very much recommend them to anyone that needs painting work done.,2
"How anybody has ever given this place a 5 is beyond me! Dirty silverware, HORRIBLE drinks my ""Irish coffee "" tasted of water and . perhaps a hint of old coffee, not to mention cold and inedible food. Can't really say much for the service, my waiter was obviously new and one can't blame him for that.",1
Not bad compared to some of the others in the area but its still small and way overpriced. If you are a big guy they have NOTHING over 1XL. If you are a kid they don't have jack for toys. But they have lots of stuff to scour through. They don't have any of the NEW merchandise like at other locations but if you look hard enough you can find something you like. I found a sweet bracelet for 3! Score!,1
I like having a Penney's back at Christown. The new Sephora store within a store us awesome! I like the clothing and home good selections. It us also nice to be able to order online and pick it up there convenient. The staff seems really customer oriented even though they work with a diverse community they are affable with all. Thw store us clean and organized.,2
"I really try to support local business and really tried to like this place. I even went a few times, thinking the next time would be better. The last time I went I spent 7 bucks on what was old, cold, nasty lemon chicken. I really, really wanted to like this place. After my last experience, I won't go back.",1
"I love Brixx! I lived in Charlotte for 4 years this is one of the only restaurants that I miss. The Brixx salad is my favorite salad OF ALL TIME. Their pizza is also really tasty. The Americo Rustica are my favorites. But, I have to say that they would probably get 5 stars from me for their salad alone.",2
"I stayed here for a convention. Nice location but very run down. I had to upgrade after one night because the room was so dirty. My ""view "" room was awful, the Donny and Marie sign on the windows obstructed the view to the point that it wasn't enjoyable. Had to spend an extra 30 for the view and a coffee maker.",1
I have been to this salon twice now and I have to say that my experience was very good. I first went for a haircut my hair is short and I was given Alicia's name by a friend of mine who also has short hair. It was a great cut so when I needed to have my hair highlighted I went back and Alicia again did a great job. This Aveda salon is very clean with personable employees.,2
"Food was authentic and very delicious. Charcoal grilled tasty morsels of deliciousness. Kind of pricey, but if you want the best in authenticity. Then you need to pay the price, quality was great too. I'd go back to try more of the menu. I love it. You gotta pay to play! And I'm definately gonna play again.",2
"Michael helped me out with a traffic incident I had a few months back. He and his staff are super responsive when I had questions and got me a result far better than I was expecting. I would never hesitate to call again and have referred many friends to date. Do your self a favor and call Mike, you won't be disappointed.",2
"Stop now! Think twice! nI came here because pho Kim long had a line. Worst mistake ever. The server not only had broken English but had no common sense. I said I'd like veggie pho and no drink just water. He brought everyone else's food. And not mine, when I asked where mine was he yelled at me and argued that I had ordered nothing. A seriously comical experience.",1
"I heard this pizzeria was 2 in the country. I'll say this I would be disappointed if I had paid 5 for this 'pizza'. Horrible. Horrible. Very little cheese, little toppings. JUST NOT GOOD AT ALL. I am a fan of thin, crispy pizza Villa, La Familia, etc , but this was not good, and I have no doubt I will ever go back.",1
They were very friendly on the phone but once they came out they didn't fix the problem. Sink was clogged and they snaked the lines but it cost 380 including the service fee and we had to call another plumber out 2 weeks later. Skip this company and go for a smaller family owned option. This company also doesn't offer a service guarantee.,1
"I've never had a bad shish taouk in Montreal, I feel like giving Basha only four stars because they give all of us Canucks plastics plates and automatically serve Middle Eastern terrorists with fancy china. But I haven't found a good shish taouk or shawarma in the USA since I relocated 7 yrs ago still looking , so it gets a 5 .",2
"Took yelper's advice and got the delicious pork belly japanese lasagna, I also ordered my favorites agadashi tofu, tuna poke salad, miso black cod and they were prepared excellently. We arrived early so it was kind of quiet and we received excellent friendly service. Finished our meal with the tempura ice cream also delicious and looking forward to our next visit.",2
"My name is Marcelo Falconi, I have known Valentina since 2009, she helped me with the purchase of two properties, a house and a condo. Valentina was able to find me the best deal possible both times, she invested a lot of time in both of these deals. She is the most diligent and efficient realtor I've ever known, I strongly recommend her for any real state need anybody may have.",2
"I had comped tickets and still found this event 1 star. Very small room, no seating and no cocktail tables. Ambiance was awful. Small appetizer section had very long lines and mediocre food. Wine selection was low quality. I have a wine app that tells you all about a wine just from it's label and all wines that were served retail for about 12. Not high quality at all. Skip this event.",1
"we had our valentines dinner here at Indian paradise, were so excited that there's Indian restaurant here in Scottsdale since we just recently moved from San Francisco. I only gave 2 stars because the food are way to expensive for what you get and thee food isn't that great either. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at dinner time.",1
"Bad Experience this particular location.while myself and friends ordered the cook was on his cell phone texting. Once our orders were taken he put his phone in his pocket and grabbed a bowl, I immediately inquired if he was going to wash his hands. The cashier relayed the message to him and from that point on eyes rolled pots were slammed and the food was undercooked. UNACCEPTABLE",1
Beautiful club! Spacious and they run a tight ship. Yack on the floor.no problem.cleaned in matter of minutes. Big fat guy dancing on the pole next to you.staff asked him to move in matters of seconds. I had fun with my girls.that's all the matters right? Pool scene was cool and the bartenders paid more attention to the girls.sorry boys. It's more fun when girls have their buzz on.,2
"This place sucked. Don't get me wrong, the price and portions were very good but the food was not. They use too much mayo in the cali roll, the rice was too mushy, katsu sauce is awful and should be served on the side, salmon doesn't taste fresh. I've tasted way better, Sushi Twister Momo Sushi are definitely ahead of this place.",1
"Don't waste your calories here. Their burgers are boring, the buns are tough and the food court ambience makes you feel like you are at a mall. This is decent before Holsteins Cosmo , but I would never come here again consider a much much better, tastier burger joint being a few hotels away. The only good thing is their fries are freshly cut and fried.",1
"Pot tea social house is not your typical Taiwanese hot pot cuisine. It's way better,we had the popcorn chicken and the spicy beef hot pot good enough. To share for 2people.service was great,restaurant Was very clean and the owner bought us dessert winning.come and check this gem in the southwest out.",2
"Ordered take out for lunch. Had the BBQ sampler lunch with pulled pork, beef brisket, and pork ribs. The brisket stood out amongst the meats and was very good. The pork stuff was not that impressive. Overall I felt the food was not great for the price. Had a beer at the bar while I waited which was very cool. Decor to entertain.",1
"Misleading restaurant. We were under the impression that this restaurant could take a joke, however when my mate Big Ry calls a c nt a c nt and says to the waitress ""Where's my coleslaw you f cking sl g!? "" he just gets completely ignored! I had to hold him down in order for him to not kick off big time.",1
"Paris. French Crepes. Good? Just ok. Crepevine, a chain in San Francisco, makes better crepes. I will say the crepe itself, the pancake like dough part is awesome. But either it had too much sauce or it was too salty. One tasted like lasagna, the other was just salty with ham or something. Not eating here again.",1
"Cashew chicken and beef stir fry noodle were both unappetizingly bland. Service was lackluster. With all the fabulous dining, spend an extra 4, and 20 minute wait if need be, and go anywhere else. 2 stars were only because of ambiance and price. But even still, would've rather paid more for ""Strip quality "" food.",1
Oh the chai tea oh how I love you sooooo. The price for the large is a little crazy in my opinion but its still good none the less. I'm not quite sure when I will visit again because I am heavily disappointed the Hawaiian sea salt caramel is not an option anymore. So until they get something similar again I will hold off.,2
"I came in looking for shirts for father's day and was amazed at how helpful everyone was. Lola in Motorclothes was awesome, everyone was full of energy and seemed genuinely excited to be there. nMet a few of the service guys on our way out, extremely nice and very knowledgeable. Best dealership in the valley Leaps and Bounds ahead",2
"We just had dinner here and we are completely unimpressed. The burger my husband had was ok. The wings weren't crispy at all and judging by the way some of them were stuck together, they came straight out of the freezer and into the fryer. The macaroni and cheese from their ""Premium Sides "" selections was poorly made right out of a box i.e., Kraft . Won't eat here again.",1
Fantastic! Don't miss eating here.we had 2 breakfasts and lunch and should have gone there for dinner as well.fabulous food.fabulous service and great atmosphere.there is always a line for street seating but they have a room with all glass so you are enjoying the outdoors just as well and no lines.indoor seating is just as nice.loved it!,2
I was here a few days ago to pick up some coffee and the Arizona Burro. I went through the drive thru and there were tons of flies flying in and out of the open drive thru window and into my car as well and landing in the open peanut butter container I could see. Having flies everywhere is not a good sign of cleanliness at all. This is awful.,1
"Had breakfast here, and the food is typical diner style. However, the sourdough toast was awesome! Thick and fresh and real butter. Tip.order the blueberry pancakes, but have them put the mound of blueberry compote on the side.might be too much for some. Bacon was done perfectly, not fatty or chewy.crisp. Coffee was just so so.",1
"It's a decent store. Whenever we come in to town, we'll stop in here. usually after a few beverages at Big Dog's Draft House and get some essentials for the trip. The place has always been clean and well stocked. The cashiers have been friendly as well. I can't complain about a thing. Will I be back? You bet I will.",2
"Yo this place is for YUPPIES. If your a real punk go drink at CASA DEL POPOLO or L'Esco. The ambiance sucks and the menu is stupid. You go to pharmacies to feel better and bars can make you pass out blotto on the sidewalk in your own puke! Would a real pharmacy cause you that much misery? No. So this place is, in fact, a logical fallacy or phallacy for you pervs, boinggg! ",1
"In AZ on business. Pleasant atmosphere, friendly and helpful wait staff. Food was just okay. Salad had too much oregano. Ordered the souvlakis shrimp and lamp . Lamb was quite good, but shrimp, despite being recommended by our server, was overcooked and stale. Roasted potatoes and vegetables were average. Few gluten free desserts. Probably wouldn't come here again.",1
"Had dinner tonight, started with a bowl of cold mushroom soup that tasted like the cook dropped the pepper mill into the soup. Then had a chicken Caesar salad. I should have asked for the dressing on the side, not because they put alot on it, because I don't think they put any on it. Hope served us and she was the only reason I gave this nights experience 2 stars",1
"Our Conceirge at the Wynn hotel suggest this place so we had high hopes but were a bit disappointed afterwards. Maybe because we love Chef Batali so we had higher expectations? We've had better steaks in Las Vegas. Delmonico for one is made my steak better. I don't really see or taste anything special in this steak. Side portions are pretty small We love chef Batali, just not this restaurant",1
"Food is solid if you know what to order and the restaurant has a nice casual vibe. The carne asada nachos are killer, and the house rice with chorizo and pineapple is super tasty. I ordered the mushroom quesadilla, which was too rich for me, but I tried a short rib taco off my friend's plate and it was yummy.",2
"This is a fun place. Cool lighting. Good sound. Good stage. Great green room backstage. A little odd to have pool tables going in the middle of live music, in front of the stage, but at least it isn't predictable. We played a show with The Warlocks here and had a blast. A Trevor and The Joneses highlight for sure.",2
I find the staff needing more help in delivering service. nOn my last two visits we ordered appetizers that never arrived. Both times I had been given the same lame excuss that the order had fallen on the floor and was being recooked. I found this to be rehearsed and not very beliveable. nThe food arrived a bit cold and feel the staff may have been the same.,1
"Went here for an early morning breakfast, as soon as they opened i had to wait 5 minutes before they seated us. After we sat down we waited another n10 before we got up and left. One girl was soo slow to bring out food to a gentleman who ordered nothing but oatmeal. I will only go there to get a muffin already made and that's it.",1
"Mmmm! All 6 of us left stuffed and happy! Everything here is fresh, from scratch, from the tortillas to the yummy, smokey corn chips. The family who owns the place is incredibly kind and accommodating. Honestly, I don't even like mexican food but the ingredients, service, and homey feel won me over. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular.",2
"Today I was in a desperate hurry to find a comfortable shoe for work shifts, and a wonderful girl named Alexa helped me do that. She dug through the back more than three times to try to find my unusual size and smiled the whole time she help me. She was very patient and very sweet and very knowledgeable about her product. Thank you!",2
I found the experience today less than desirable as Kyle who was making my drink with his long hair hanging down over his eye's. As he was making the drink shaking his hair and who knows what was falling into my drink. You would think management would have him wear a hair net. I will no longer order drinks if Kyle is working with his hair dangling over my drink.,1
"Diverse crowd , strong drinks and amazing happy hour prices . Tequila sunrise 3 rounds 15 ! Dope! Nice space outside, great weather yesterday so took advantage of the patio. I heard Sundays are live with a DJ, I def want to go back then. My bartender was accommodating and always made sure I had a full drink! The place was clean and made me feel at home. Will be back! 5 stars",2
"I don't know if I'd ever go to Macayo's if it didn't have 2 Dos Equis and a free buffet on Fridays. The food is your typical Mexican chain food. The patio is huge which is a plus between 75 and 95 degrees after that it gets pretty torturous. All in all, it's an alright spot to crash out with friends after work on Fridays.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the wide range of offerings, including a fantastic spaghetti carbonara, which I didn't expect at a Japanese coffee shop. The Yuzu soda is fantastic. They put some Yuzu jam in the bottom of a glass, add club soda and ice, then stir. As you drink, you stir and it brings up this Asian citrus fruit. Delicious.",2
"Got a cold. I went here to get some soup n watch the NFL playoff game. Cowboys vs. Detroit. I ordered the Chicken Noodle soup. It sounds like gourmet soup according to the description. Little did I known. It tasted like soup from a CAN! ""Canned Soup! "" I paid 8 for something I can get at local grocery store for much lesssssss! And the Cowboys are Losingggg! Can I get a break here?!",1
"I'm not really sue why this place gets great reviews. It is really sweet build out, and I would love to enjoy the atmosphere, but I can't sit down inside? Chris is great and does a great job with his restaurants, but I can't understand what is going on here. The sandwich I had was just so so. It's only saving grace is that it is next to Lux. That place is the best.",1
"I am Italian and I am a pizza snob. I was born and raised in Wisconsin where a lot of italian places take great pride in the pizza making process, we moved down to Goodyear 3 years ago. I LOVE Barro's pizza. Service is great. Delivery usually is 45 min to a hour but whatever. You will not be disappointed. A family of 5 can eat under 36.",2
"I tried this place based on the reviews. I got the Chicago deep dish. Horrible. TNot enough cheese, bad crust, horrible sauce, not enough sauce. I mean crappy, Pizza Hut would be better than this. Definitely not a good Chicago deep dish pizza. Still haven't found a good one in Vegas or henderson. Best I have had was Masa in echo park in SoCal.",1
"Am really bummed out at the last meal there. The service was great, as always, but did you get a new chef and kitchen staff? This was not the pad thai we know and love, and even the coconut ice cream was terrible like crystal ice milk, and blah. please don't make us have to consider re trying Papaya Thai, was a distant second to your food, but may now be pacing you.",1
"The only item I shall ever order is their cheese quesadilla because the cheese is pleasing to thine soul especially when the green is burning and their green sauce tickles the roof of my mouth and the night has fallen like humpty dumpty if you know what i mean, be nice and go there and put their food in your bones.",2
The Good Clean rooms nGood Value nAffordable Meals and Drinks Paid 2 3.50 for drinks nCrowd Control Never overly crowded nSmoke Control Our room seemed smoke free nFriendly Staff nGreat for families Bowling and Movies The Bad Decor Old chairs and tables nWIFI and Gym 12 and 15 respectively nFar from Strip Bottomline I would go back for what I paid for.,2
"I went back to the Rio to change and get a quick bite, and this place looked safe. Run of the mill as it gets, but the prices are a total joke. It's a burger and fries, for 14 bucks! If I pay 14 bucks for a burger and fries at a walk up joint, it should at least be sufficiently kick ass. Not at all.",1
"Hot, cheesy yumminess. Yes, please! For 5 slice this is a great way to get away from all the buffets and fine dining and just kick back. My favorites were the mushroom and cheese. There's also a nice lounge area to shoot pool and kick it outside the hallway. Chill out to the max. It's also very close to the Eastside Tower elevators, so take a ride to the 3rd floor and enjoy a late night snack.",2
"Everytime I am in Vegas, this is my must have food either for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Depending on the time of the day, sometimes I get the savory with cheese and spinach or fresh berries. Which ever are so good. It's pricey, over 10 for French crepe, but then again you are in Vegas. The portion is rather huge, be hungry when you order one or get one to share.",2
"Went to eat at Central last September. The food was amazing. I started with the cheese puffs and went with the rib eye with pepercorn sauce for my mains. The steak was cooked to perfection, possible better than any steakhouse in Vegas. nand get the celebration cake. Delicious pancake bellinis inside",2
"Very upscale place with very few tables. The service is great and the food is really good. However I'd probably not go back to it. The atmosphere is a little to quiet for my liking. They are super high ceiling with no music. It's almost as if you can hear a pin drop. If you like that kind of place, this is for you but I tend to enjoy a place with some music.",2
"PBelow average service. Had a pedi and while the polish looks good, the rest was sad. The young man who did it literally attacked me with cuticle nippers and nearly pecked me to bloody shreds. 4 hours later and I'm still stinging. Not much of a massage either. Then, for Mani, they left both me and my friend sitting in the pedi chair and proceeded to pull our arms out of our sockets. Won't be back.",1
"America's Taco Shop make some of the best meat available at a mexican food restaurant. Having said that, with the surprisingly small the portions combined with how steep the prices are, it's better to go somewhere else. My burrito was about as thick as a broom handle and my wife's quesadilla had almost no cheese at all in it. Spent too much for not enough!",1
"Great pizza! Definitely old school Italian style, the marinara is made with fresh tomatoes! If you are partial to American style pizza, this place may not be for you. Nice guys too. I wish they had beer on tap but it's cool that they let you bring your own. We will definitely come back next time we're in Vegas.",2
I guess this is your new typical giant suburban sports bar. There is nothing about this place which is particularly interesting including the beer choices and the food choices. The service was good once we got past the ineptitude and confusion at the front door. They were trying to charge us a ten dollar cover charge because there was some kind of fight on the TV. As if i care.,1
I've had the green apple tea with boba and a spam musubi which only comes in two for some reason . The food and boba drink tasted good but took a while to make which is why I give them 4 stars. Would definitely come here again but not if I am in a hurry. Also service was friendly and apologized for the long wait on the musubi.,2
This is one of the best sub shops in the Las Vegas area. There is only one location and every time I go there I forget what I ordered last time. So it is like I go there for the first time every time. All the subs are large and they all look delicious. Don't forget to try out some of their variety of hot sauces. You can't have a firehouse without a fire!,2
"Great selection of herbal supplements and homeopathic remedies. Excellent customer service friendly AND knowledgeable. I wish the products were cheaper, but they're no more expensive here than at any other store of this type. I was the only customer in the store while I was there. I hope this place survives!",2
This place is horrible. I have been to Vegas tons of times and every single time I went I always wanted to try it so I finally did and I was so disappointed! from the strip it look cool but the food is like whatever and extremely over priced! I guess I was disappointed because I expected so much more since it look nice off the strip.,1
I went there for lunch and did not partake in the buffet. My parties food took FOREVER! I was told it was because we did not order the buffet even though we ordered before most of the other parties were sat. Lunch took almost two hours. Unacceptable! No apology and preferential treatment was given to other tables. The food was mediocre at best. Won't be going there again.,1
"So far not impressed with this place. I've spoke to at least 4 people today and most of them with borderline rude, and none of them were able to help me with my inquiry about becoming a new patient. I guess they don't need my business! I find it very frustrating that I called several tmes and none of them were able to answer any of my questions.",1
"Finally! After drooling over everyone else's review I was able to stop by here after dinner at Lebowskis with Kelly C. I got the chocolate sea salt, which is cream based and ah mazing. I would probably go here every day if it was always in the same place. Towards the end I was a complete mess and covered in chocolate, but it was well worth it. A must go and only 2.50 for awesomeness!",2
This is probably the worst Target I have been in. They are always out of stuff and the place is pretty dirty. The people who work here are nice enough but the place is always so picked over! I hate that the women's section is mashed up with the pregnant lady clothes and the shoe department is always a mess. I much prefer the Lake Mead location.,1
"I've shopped at Milano Music since moving to Phoenix valley 9 years ago and I've always left the store satisfied. As a drummer, it is so helpful to have a drum head like Tom on hand to help find what you're looking for. Local stores could use Milano's as a model. As far as gear, they have simple beginner stuff and pro models as well. Check them out!",2
"I discovered Vien through friends. I have gotten pedicures from several of the staff, and they are always nice, polite, and professional. The pedicures include massage and hot stones and cost only 20. I usually call ahead for the same day and so far have not had a problem getting an appointment. A great find!",2
"Super warm and hospitable! Owner is from Naples, very welcoming and generous. Free dessert and shots of limoncello plus some other cinnamon liquor. The capriciosa pizza was amazing . Love the authentic Italian olives and artichokes! I feel so full and happy leaving here. They have an outdoor bar where you can eat drink under cool mist lamps. Very comfortable and chill. Good for people watching.",2
"Delicious! I had the salted caramel and my fiance had the pear. Both flavors were truly delectable, creamy textures and served by super friendly gals. Sample until you find your favorite, or have the gals suggest something new like mixing pumpkin and the cake batter flavor! . The gelato is incredibly rich, so the small size was enough for 2 nights of desert for me. Another local treat!",2
"Basically all you do is walk from computer to computer, to computer. I thought I would be able to physically do some ""detective work "" like looking for clues or maybe dust for finger prints with baby powder or look thru a microscope for fake DNA or a least something interesting, but no, nothing fun. Total disappointment.",1
"We're Frank Lloyd Wright design fans. and it was very interesting. but just don't go in the summer. There isn't any A C in the buildings, and you wander from one to the next on a tour that feels endless while you are about to expire in the Phoenix August. In the cooler months, I'm sure it's awesome.",2
"NEVER come here if you don't have the time to stay at least 40 minutes! Both times I've come in on my 3 tan pass, outs been a complete cluster. Only reason I gave 2 stars is because as ridiculously slow as they are, the staff is friendly. Considering not even using the third tan on my pass at this point though!",1
"After reading the reviews, maybe our expectations were too high. The food was ok, but pricey. 160 for 2 cocktails, 2 glasses wine, 3 individual pizzas, 2 salads and 2 desserts. I know this sounds petty but they set a basket of 3 slices of bread at a table for 4 with our salads and when we asked for more bread they said there would be an additional charge! Tacky",1
"We went to Panevino for a very special occasion this week and everything was great! The restaurant is beautiful, Vincenzo and Mark made us feel very special, the service was professional and attentive. The suppli, crabcakes, spinach tortino for appetizers delicious! The salmon cooked perfect. The children chicken tenders were homemade and very good as well as the pizza. AWESOME! Loved it!",2
Not really impressed with the flavors and they didn't have my 18 mg of nicotine they don't have a vap station so you have to stand and wait for them to set up a tasting the stool they have to sit on are very shaky so be careful it didn't like formula 51 or the smurf one and they don't have their own juice the juice they do have is very over priced I won't be going back,1
I seriously have issues with the way certain leagues are ran with where the money goes and also the fact management can't back up what they say we had a bowler get kicked out for a fight then management said he was not allowed back in and was out of the league but next week he was back acted like nothing ever happened at least 2 teams left after this issue,1
The best of Las Vegas? I'm not sure how that happened. I ordered the Mongolian beef and combination chow mein. The beef was alright but the noodle dish was inedible. The sesame oil they used made the noodles taste like vomit and the dish's overall orange color only helped cement that analogy. I will never go back.,1
"Decent chips and salsa, the free app was a nice touch but way under staffed for a Friday happy hour in the bar. Bartender was swamped and was the only one servicing the large bar area. Food was ok.and prices were not too bad no food specials for happy hour . Wish there were other local options in the area.",1
"Carpets looked great. Had some high traffic areas that were black. They did a deep cleaning and restored them to original color. The only thing that sucked was that there was a old wet dirty dog smell after the job was done. Other than that, Good job. Also they were on time and the prices were pretty good.",2
"I can't stop thinking about the french fries! I think they were batter dipped prior to frying. The buffalo chicken sandwich was good. Good size menu with something for everyone. Large open style, good for groups. Plenty of tvs. Kinda felt more like an Applebee's than a place is go regularly to watch games. I will definitely go back for the fries.",2
"Very good food and great ambiance. The only problem is the wait, since the place is small there is usually an hour wait to get a table. I would suggest getting there early to put your name in, then having a drink next door. The pizza is close to what you find in Italy. Thin hand tossed crust with fresh toppings and the wood fired oven gives it a delicious taste.",2
"WOW, best rotisserie chicken ever! Oh yeah, got a steak too! Great Hotel for a very trendy dinner spot. Cool ambiance, great menu. Bone in Rib eye was perfect. Mac and Cheese on the side, who has a problem with that? Rotisserie chicken was moist, great spices, cooked to perfection! Good drinks, great crowds. Will be back 100 ",2
"I wish they would line up some more bands that I'm interested in, because this place was a lot of fun. The only time I've been so far was to see the Eagles of Death Metal show, which was a blast. Sound was good, drink prices weren't bad. I wasn't sure what to expect because Scottsdale isn't really my thing. This is one place I would go back to often if they got some more bands I'm into.",2
"We came here for lunch and ordered the Reuben with baked potato soup and a Monte cristo sandwich with a salad. The salad was very gross, wilted and brown so we sent it back only with a laugh from the server. Soup was OK and sandwiches were OK. We might have expected too much from the ratings. I have a feeling breakfast is the only thing you should order. Don't expect much from the service either",1
"This place is awesome! This is our second time dining here and it never disappoints. We had the chilean sea bass, dover sole, shrimp scampi, spaghetti with meatballs which are all terrific. The music playing in the background are upbeat pop sounds. Most of the diners that come here wear business casual but i saw some in shorts and flip flops. We will definitely go back here.",2
Bubbles was right about the two little window charge. I'm so glad I saw ur comment before buying the 5 window groupon. I called them and asked them how much it would cost me so they quoted me 45 on top of the 119 groupon bc of my two Lil windows in my back seat. I mean it's only 45 but I think that's pretty shady. It's the principal of it and I won't be going there.,1
"Really nice little place to chill and have a drink. Very grown up. It's on the 23rd floor, and has pretty nice views of the south end of the strip. They also have a menu for finger foods. Kinda pricey tho. The only thing that turned me off was that the windows weren't clean, but I'll blame that on last week's storm.",2
"I would give this place zero star if such rating is available. I waited for almost an hour for the food when there is only 1 other table besides mine. The food is also overpriced and overrated. 11 for a small bowl of Pho? No thanks! The broth is just mediocre, nothing special. Overall, I don't think this place deserve to be on the Food Network. I rather go swhere else to get a 6 Pho bowl.",1
"I love lobby's. The staff is super nice and attentive, and the burgers are juicy and delicious. It's a little bit pricier for a meal, but I definitely think it's way more worth it than getting a burger from mcdonald's or burger king. Everything is made fresh when you order it, so prepare to enjoy some deliciousness! It's also super clean in there, so I don't feel gross about eating there.",2
Stopped in for a quick lunch. I only had 20 minutes and was in and out in 15. There was enough customers to say it was busy and the staff was great about getting everyone through the line quick. I had my sub within 5 minutes of walking in the door. Great place to stop for people in a hurry! All the tables were nice and clean which was enjoyable.,2
Not much to do here. The restaurants here aren't that great and went into this restaurant that had dirty dishes and we just walk off and left. The mall that they had here was pretty cool. I got to buy some hairclips and there were some cute pandas on the top floor of the mall. This is a great place for buying cheap souvenirs and little trinkets.,1
"This hotel gets 3 stars. If you are expecting a luxurious hotel, this is not the place to stay. Book a room at the Mirage for that. They have much nicer rooms for the same price. We got the king suite. Very tiny. Not good if you will be spending most of your time in your room. But if you want a cheaper place to stay and will be out and about while you stay here, the NYNY would be adequate.",1
"Haven't been to the Havana Cafe in years. Forgot all about it until a friend suggested that we have lunch there. The service was great and so was the food. Can't remember what the name of the entree was that I ordered, but it was spicy shredded beef with two skewers of grilled zucchini and mushrooms and plantains as well . all very good! I will put Havana Cafe on the rotation of lunch time spots!",2
"I have been a loyal Arby's customer for 20 something years and this is the worst Arby's. They are always polite but the food is always awful! I have gone back 5 times now and keep HOPING the next time will be better, but it never is. Sadly, I will not go back. What happened Arby's? Hoping I can find another one close by.",1
"This is THE best place to get a chemical peel or any amazing skin product. I have trusted their esthetician with my skin for years and she is the reason why it looks so amazing, clear and glowing. This place is a must for anyone who wants to see actual lasting results and get a great education on what's best for your skin from someone who has lots of experience and knowledge.",2
"For the life of me, I can't understand why people rave about this place. Their sushi is lousy, and their hibachi is mediocre at best! And waaaaay overpriced. Granted the location is great and the decor is awesome, but I as a diner I'm much more concerned about food service quality than a gorgeous setting. Thumbs down, try Yokoso on the Waterfront.",1
"I like the casino, that's why we decided to stay here. However, we were pretty underwhelmed as hotel guests. The staff is rude and apathetic as crap, talking poop right in front of guests. At least hide your disdain for everyone! The rest of society does. The buffet is bomb but next time I go to Vegas, I will for sure stay somewhere else.",1
"My second visit and it will probably will be my last. Had a Bueno Burger bueno style and a Bueno Dog bueno style. The condiments were ok, but way to much it made my burger and dog colder than the condiments it really made me feel like the meat was not cooked and the burger tasted like they dumped a bottle of liquid smoke on it. We will find out if I get a bueno case of Montezuma's Revenge later.",1
I have been a loyal customer for 14 years and was shocked to look at my accounts and see 87 if fees. I have a checking account that I thought met all the requirements for free checking and was hit with 87 in charges. I will be closing all my accounts. It's a shame as the staff at this branch is helpful and really nice.,1
"Dina and her team did a wonderful job cleaning my house. They were efficient, detailed and diligent. They took the time to ensure corners and hard to reach places were covered, not to mention they were super fun to talk to. Dina also generously shared her cleaning tips and products for my everyday up keep. Will definitely ask for them for my next cleaning job. Thank you!",2
"My wife and I went here last weekend, it was really good. We were just going to sit at the bar and have a drink but someone ordered pizza next to us and it looked awesome. We ordered a pizza and new people sitting next to us started asking us about the pizza. The food was good, the bar tenders were nice and the beer was good. We will be back.",2
"Excellent, les brunchs sont d u00e9licieux. Un pour le tcha u00ef latte. Et un cadre vraiment joli, design au naturel, agr u00e9able est tr u00e8s bien tenu. Belle qualit u00e9 de service, avec attention et rapide, et un lieu tr u00e8s propre. n5 u00e9toiles pour des prix vraiment bien positionn u00e9s, cela m u00e9rite le d u00e9tour.",2
"Personally I think this place is a tiny bit more expensive than it should really be, but coffee places always are. I've only ever had the fruit smoothies here, but they were great and met my expectations. The service is quick, and all the cashiers I've had were nice to me. As a bonus, this place looks really nice on the inside.",2
"Coffee was warm, not hot like most coffee shops. Taste was okay. Server had hubcaps in his ears but cool. Said he'd bring it to me. Then a girl yells out ""regular coffee "" and sat it on the counter. No room for cream. So good place for stoners to hang out I guess. The place was clean. Maybe just a bad day. How much trouble is a up of Joe.",1
"They have a really good happy hour with 50 off select apps and cheap cocktails, such as the 4 margarita. I had the avocado egg rolls and crab crunch roll, but very delicious! Overall the food is really good but the drinks are a little strong for me. But for people that enjoy a very strong cocktail, this is the place to go. They definitely don't skimp on the alcohol here.",2
"I won't be ""kneading "" this place again. It sounded good, but the sandwiches where pretty disappointing. I got the turkey and cranberry croissant. It was rather bland and lacked the gusto that the picture showed. Oh well. The staff seemed pretty nice though. I'm not mad I tried it, I just probably won't be coming back.",1
"Despite the fact that they tell you their beans are vegetarian, and put them in the vegetarian burrito, The Original Burrito Company makes their beans with CHICKEN STOCK. This is false information they are providing to people, and when people have moral issues with consuming meat, this turns into a huge issue. I will never eat here again. I do not support businesses that are dishonest.",1
"I went in for an oil change with a coupon. They told me I needed every service they provide, such as coolant, hoses, belts, wipers, etc. The problem is that all these things are new and they are trying to maximize the final total. They also misplaced my coupon and tried to charge me full price. I will never go back.",1
"I enjoyed another great evening at Milagro Grill. We shared flatbread, quesadillas, ribeye chimichurri skewers, guacamole, salsa, divine gazpacho, sangria, and fantastic innovative desserts. A great place to celebrate, take friends, or enjoy a tequila flight on the patio! We will be back soon. Thanks to James, Ben, and all the skilled staff!",2
"Something so simple done unbelievably well. First time? Try the Oggie The Traditional Pasty with steak, potatoes, onion and a side of red wine gravy DON'T YOU DARE GET KETCHUP INSTEAD! If you want something a little more southwest, the Carne Adovada is RIDICULOUS. They also have a great variety of local beer on tap.",2
"Every time I pop into this BevMo location, I always get what I need for a decent price. I tend to visit this BevMo location once or twice a month. The staff is extremely available, knowledgeable, and approachable. If they are out of what I am looking for they always have a great suggestion for something new to try and everything is always priced reasonable.",2
"I'm just speaking on the buffet, and this probably ranks one of the worst for me. The buffet was cheap, literally and I guess you get what you pay for. We waited like 45 minutes for a table, the people were friendly, but food was not good. You better off going to like the luxor buffet. The highlight was the giant fish tank and Bass Pro shop.",1
This was my first time having frozen custard. I didn't think i would be amazed with something so simple. I've tried it all from fro yo to shaved ice to fried ice cream. I didn't know know there could be more ways of enjoying a frozen treat. I'm going to dream about it until i make another trip to vegas.,2
Thursday two for one drink specials! You can't beat that. But of course that comes with a grain a salt. it is packed with undergrads and the parking can fill up leaving you to park across the street at del taco. Fortunately the place is a good size and there are entertaining music videos that accompanies the super loud music.,2
Managers mean to there employees. The service was really lacking so much so I really wanted to say something. Food was good and there was plenty of it. We made it there at the end of breakfast so we stayed a bit and tried some of there lunch stuff. The food here is worth checking out. The low rating is for there lack of service.,1
"YES GO HERE GO HERE! The ONLY good pho place in town, PROMISE! It can get pretty packed, but its well worth the wait for us You also get a decent bang for the buck here. Ive always ordered seafood pho, and they are not stingy with the good stuff. Ive recently starting expanding my horizons and explored other dishes on the menu, they are alway on point. Open late, great place!",2
"Looks from outside completely empty, no cars in the parking lot, and walk in. BAM! A FULL HOUSE! The wait didn't bother me as I'm here to have people draw my blood, not order a number 3 with fries and a shake. When I did got in after about an hour, they are quick and painless, then I went to BurgerKing and got my number 3 and fries no shake thou. My advice don't go here at 9 00 am on a Tuesday D",2
"This venerable institution of fine dining never ceases to impress. As a local I've been a frequent guest on many of occasions and each meal has left me filled not only in appetite but with an incredible dinning experience. From the onset with the woman receiving a rose to the table side salad made to order, well aged steaks to the delectable desserts Hugo's never fails to impress.",2
a very modern style resturant that is innovative and contemporary. the food is a good and the customer service is great also i was greeted right away and or server was very nice and was patient with everything. nthe food is excellent and the design of the resturant is great also. overall michael mina is a great resturant,2
"OK. YOU HAVE TO GET POKEY STICKS IF YOU GO TO CHAMPAIGN. PERIOD. They are incredible! Always a must for a drunk night. And cheap, so if you spent all your money at the bar and are hungry, a good way to go! Plus on Tuesdays, they double your order! The pizza, not so much, but who orders pizza from gumbys when they have POKEY sticks?",2
"Small menu, but the three item I call were good. But, since I come from SoCal to visit, this place's ramen doesn't seem any more special compare to the many we have from home, but still it's good! The price make it's worth it compare to most places near the strip. To sum it up, good food, decent price, but don't expect anything extraordinary if you had Japanese ramen before ",2
"You only get 1 star because I have to give it. You have a HUGE sign above the doors saying you support the troops, yet you pick and choose the items you give military discounts on. If I didn't have a gift card for your store I would have never shopped there. Thank you for reminding me why I shop at Lowes. They at least don't contradict themselves.",1
"Excellent fine chocolates in unusual flavors, but I had to remove a star for the poor customer service. Bought Blood Orange Chocolate Bar, Bacon Chocolate Bar, and Gingerbread Chocolate Bar. I will go back for the decadent chocolates but management needs to take the time to train their staff to receive paying customers in a better manner. Very disappointing experience for such great products.",2
"1st time my wife and I got food here it was ok.we ordered egg roll which was horrible, definitely not New York style.We also ordered beef and brocolli which was just ok. The second time we went there my wife ordered chicken mein fun when we got home she immedietly got sick. This New Yorker won't be going back.I'm not going to spend another night cleaning up my wife's vomit.",1
"Love zpizza. Where else can you get cremini and shitake mushrooms, truffle oil, capers or eggplant on a delivery pizza? And, the crust? It's yummy. I like it in wheat . . it's a little crispier. And, their flour and marinara is organic, which can't hurt. And, last, the XL pizza is huge. WTF is Dominos, Papa Johns etc all excited about their piddly 14 "" pizza made out of crap?",2
"This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty , service is slow, and the ice maker makes a weird slurping sound.like someones in there. This place has such a lousy reputation that the line around the half gas station McDonalds can be wrapped around twice and no one will wait at Burger King. King Nasty!",1
Me and a friend went here to get the Jack Daniels burger. The host was very quick and very nice. After being seated we looked over our menu and sat there and waited and waited and waited. After 10 mins of being ignored not one single staff member stopped and talked to us. What a shame and an embarrassment to have customers walk out.,1
"LOVE THIS PIZZA! OMG nSo good! The crust is that like thin but crunchy kind, and the red sauce on the pizzas is absolutely perfect. nI like their wide array of pizzas and toppings even though I can't have any pesto pizza because of the nuts in the pesto, boo This place, and Classic Italian in Tempe are the best pizza places I've been in to AZ hands down.",2
"So frustrated! I've asked them 5 different times for extra sauce on my pizza and they blatantly ignore me. In fact, it's like they purposely put less sauce thaormal because I asked for extra. If I wanted cheese bread, I would order cheese bread. I have given them one too many chances to get my order right. Never going back.",1
"Ann Barnard saved my life and my self esteem. Through education, encouragement and compassion, Ann helped me change my life. For the first time in my 38 years I feel strong! I can climb stairs without huffing and puffing, I can play with my daughter willingly and happily and I actually WANT to exercise. Training with Ann was worth EVERY penny!",2
I was at this nursery recently and could not find anyone but one man outside that attempted to help me. The only problem was he couldn't understand my language nor could I understand his. I was there to make a significant purchase but walked right out. WOW Star nursery.an unbelievably horrific experience.,1
"What a great find! Great service, food, atmosphere. The staff was friendly and helpful. A good story behind the ambience. Just ask one of the very attentive wait help or in our case, the owner. The aroma and decor added to the night. Can't wait to go back again and try something differnt. Mac n cheese.mmmmmm.",2
"I love Capriotti's, we order it at work for extended staff meetings because they deliver. However, this location delivers when it wants to. The reason for the inconsistency they claim is based on whether or not they are busy. I will never understand why you'd miss out on sales. We were excited when this location opened, but we're missing our old location that was always able to deliver.",1
This is a great target store. It is clean and well stocked. I can find anything I need or want here. The employees have always beeice and helpful. Everytime I walk into this place I end up spending more than I planned. I could easily spend a great amount of money here if I'm not careful. Go here and get your items. Just hold on to your pocket book.,2
"Don't let the full parking lot and long lines fool you. One or two slices of meat and cheese do not make a proper sandwich. Add that to the dry bread, little or no mayo mustard and what you get is no better than a factory made sandwich from 7 11. Shame, it's so close to my new residence. I guess I'll be adding another 5 minutes to my drive from now on to get a good deli sandwich from Jason's.",1
"My god, this is the second appointment Priority Appliances have scheduled with me and no show, no call! They don't answer their phone and when you leave messages they don't call you back! nI DO NOT recommend using them EVER! nAttn Consumer if a business more than a one man deal has a answering machine answering their calls during business hours they are a poor business!",1
The first time was great. The next 3 visits a disaster! Food has gone way down in quality. Horrible steak on visit 2 and the clams got us sick on our last visit. Not to mention the lack of attention from the waiter. At the prices they charge the service should be fabulous and friendly. That it was not! If you must.the calamari and the meatballs are good.,1
"Nothing but good things can be said about the food here, I simply haven't had a bad meal yet and doubt I ever will. I positively love New Mexican style cuisine and how spicy it can get. Pretty amazing how hard it is to find here in the Valley! nDrop in for a weekend brunch meal and treat yourself to a super spicy Bloody Mary or a tasty mimosa and start the morning off right.",2
"We go here for either my birthday or my mom's birthday. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. The only thing I have a problem with is the spiciness of some of the food we order. Depending on who makes it, it can be pretty mild to pretty hot. But other than that, service is good and so is the atmosphere.",2
"Great place. Doesn't matter what gates I'm at, I trek all the way over to Flatbreadz for their veggie sandwich. Juicy portabellos, arugula, tomatoes, and pesto sauce. I usually eat half while waiting at the gate and then break out the other half on the plane when everyone else is being served up pretzels and peanuts. Mean, I know. Yum yum! Love this place!",2
Do not go here! I just bought a brand new car last week 4 9 13 and took it here to be washed and it came out with tons of scratches. When I brought it to the managers attention he denyed the possibility of his car wash creating the scratches. He basically said That's what i get for having a black car. Also the vacuum job was lousy as well as the Windows.,1
"I came back last week for Happy Hour and totally enjoyed myself. The drinks were amazing and the appetizer was great also. The key for me, is to come when they open up so you get a good seat. It was packed by 6 pm. Our waitress was super friendly and came over multiple times making sure we were well taken care of. Definitely a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy some great drinks.",2
We liked it. Not very crowded for a Friday afternoon happy hour. Excellent service and the Apple cider was quite tasty. We did enjoy their wings they had a nice little kick to them and were huge. The lobster rolls were good but I thought a little over rated. I'll probably give them a chance next visit for their Sunday brunch or maybe a dinner.,2
"The only thing worthwhile about this restaurant are the beautiful views of Edinburgh. I was so excited to eat at this place. Unfortunately, it was our last night in Edinburgh, we were saving this as a special farewell treat. We should have saved our money. The food was mediocre at best. The staff was attentive, but this doesn't count for anything when they can't serve food to equal service.",1
It's not fancy. nIt's a little bit smelly. nThe equipment is old and some of it doesn't entirely work. But.it has what I need. nIt has reasonable monthly charges with no long term contracts. nNo one is trying to manipulate or upsell me into stuff I don't want. It's easy to find parking. nThere are always plenty of available machines. I guess it will do.,1
"Food is mediocre and not worth the price they charge. Most of the meat is cold, tough and overcooked and quality of the meat is also sub par lamb chops are shoulder cut and tough, ribs are also cold and tough. The desserts look far better than they taste. Some of the salads are OK. Place is clean though.",1
"The chef really makes some challenging dishes. The dishes incorporated seasonal local produce we had ramps! . All the menu choices are posted on the giant chalkboard and you get choices of sides. The restuarant is small and seating area is very tight, but acceptable. If you are looking for a contemporary menu that incorporates all many types of cuisine, look no further and bring a bottle of vino!",2
"I'm a big fan of Korean BBQ and Korean food in general. However, I was expecting the table top stove and was a little disappointed to find out that it was not one of those places. Needless to say, this restaurant has some pretty good tofu soup and kalbi. I was pretty drunk of the soju as well which just intensified the flavors. Definitely staying in my rotation.",2
"Yep, I had a salad for lunch today. A nice manly, Southwest Chicken Caesar salad. I threw the girls at this new Paradise Bakery location a curveball and ordered the large with two chocolate chip cookies to go. They hit it out of the park. My plastic salad container was filled to the max. Plus it had tons of spicy, chipotle caesar dressing. Just the way I like it.",2
"Bad food, mediocre service, terrible selection. Avoid this place. My intestines are still upset at having dinner there last night. You walk in and is like walking into the 80s, the place looks old, no updates, nothing pleasant to look at. Their roast beef is more like rubber beef. The strip has tons of options, this is not a good one.",1
"Hunter Ryum is awesome. We just closed on a house and the pool needed servicing. We've never owned a pool before, so we didn't know what this would entail. After Hunter tested the pool water and checked the pool system, he informed us that all we needed was a cleaning. His honesty was very much appreciated. The pool looks great and we've hired him to service the pool as well.",2
"Have went here for Dinner before, it was okay but not great. Went to lunch buffet and it's terrible. Not spicy. The dishes taste nothing like they should. If you must eat here, the Tandoori Chicken isn't bad. However, if you really like Indian food, stick to Chutneys in Tempe, or the really good Indian Market with a buffet on 7th street near Thomas.",1
"Nice salon and convenient location inside Capital Fitness. Cortney gives the best men's cut shave barber experience, but she just moved to Muse Salon on University Ave. She's a wonderful, professional, and very experienced barber. I've been going to her for 3 years you won't find anyone better in Madison.",2
"Been there several times. I want to really like this place, but cant. Food is great, but i dont care for the atmosphere. Seats are uncomfortable and seems the tables are really crammed in. I know this isnt their fault, but parking lot always crowded and busy. Pizza is very good, but evrything else is frustrating.",1
"Conversing with the manager has reiterated my initial impression which I'll keep to myself. After informing me that he, unlike Corporate, would not have refunded me a dime re one month ""courtesy "" refund , he had the audacity to suggest I join a 24 Hour Fitness near my new place of residence. Sorry but 24 Hour Fitness is not even a contender on the short list, or any list, for that matter.",1
"Whitfill lacks customer service! I've been there twice, never have been greeted or asked if I needed help. I walked around for 45 minutes looking for an Arizona Rosewood. Finally asked a worker who was arranging plants he didn't know. Sure they have a lot of stuff and attractively presented in front, but don't expect any service. Home Depot does it a lot better.",1
"Perfect for a big group of ppl. We were 14 people and with the price of 24.99 for sunday bunch including all you can drink mimosas , this is a place where everyone can get what they want. There is something for EVERYONE. It may not be the BEST quality of the strip but it has the most choices. I got to this buffet every time i go to vegas. Its a must! Yum Yum!",2
"I have dreamed of this place ever since leaving Vegas. I went with my sweetie while he was in a week long convention. We stayed at Mandalay Bay and I spent my week working out in the gym at the resort and unwinding in the spa. They have 4 plunge pools of varying temps beware of the cold plunge! Steam room, dry sauna, and space to relax. Really a great spa will be back for sure!",2
"I love Mediterranean food, but Cyprus Grill is just OK. The food is better than the service which isn't saying much. I was there yesterday and they screwed up my takeout order and I had to return to get the right food. When it was all said and done they did give me the correct food and let me keep the wrong food but did not try to comp me a meal or dessert. I probably won't go back.",1
"Super friendly staff. Went out of the way to help a family. The pizza is really good. The crust is really good nice and chewy not to hard and the sauce is nice and savory and not sweet like so many places. Also, ordered some bread sticks, thought they would be garlic but lacked garlic. They have one with eggs on the pizza.never seen that before.",2
"Nice place to have breakfast. Everything eggs, steak, hash browns were perfectly prepared yummy. French toast which the server said they sell out of. Why not make more then? was VERY good. Server was nice, but food took a while to get to us, as well as getting check paid took long. I would come back, though.",2
"I wish there were at least vegetarian substitutes for even one meal. I ended up with a side of mac n cheese, and a ""vegetarian "" pizza that looked like it was assembled by a child, and tasted like flour and regret. Not really satisifying. Not worth the money. The 10 off coupon with yelp was a redeeming quality, at least.",1
It's disgusting! I'm 42 years old and this is some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had. We we're staying in Las Vegas on 10 23 14 and called in an order for delivery. It took an hour and a half to get to use and the place is just down the road. It was cheap quality and bland. Don't waste your money.,1
"Just awful, the service is horrendous and I come here at least twice a week, well not any more . If they are busy or not they don't acknowledge you, and they screw up the simplest order ""Everytime "" I'm patient I have been in the service industry. Sometimes was they just put your food in their toaster and forget about you. Never again . I'm finding an Einstein bagel. This place sucks!",1
"I have friends who love this place, but it's really just bland and overpriced. 13 for a small burrito, taco, and drink is way too much for what it is. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's within walking distance of where I work, so if I'm really craving this style of food, it's not a horrible choice.",1
"Buyer beware, Dinner for 2 will cost you 2 HUNDRED dollars easy. If you are an average income person this place is NOT in uou r budget. Plus staff unfriendly ot knowledgeable. BEWARE shared portions , they are VERY small n cost 25 plus each n are NOT shareable. Advice, if cost is an issue, don't bother.",1
Best tacos I've ever had! Al pastor is amazing! Cooks are great! Fast and friendly but I can't say the same for the cashiers. They are not friendly and not helpful but I still eat here anyways cause I usually don't go back to a place if the whole staff isn't friendly but the cooks make up for it. Also the place is very clean. A must if you like street tacos!,2
"Holy crap, out of all restaurant I picked this place. Food the Mongolian rice was hard and the veges was not cooked at all. Orange chicken was so nasty, it should be called bell pepper chickeot orange. Serivce let's say the girl was not very responsive. But I do give 2 stars for the manager being so polite and letting us know how everything worked. Overall I probably would not be returning.",1
The food is amazing. I can't describe my love for this place. The pulled pork belly steamed buns is awesome. It's impossible to come here without ordering them. The only problem with this place is that they don't have a PHONE. You can't call to pick up dinner. You can't call for a table. You can't call them for anything. Food is great but service is terrible. Food out weighs the horrible service.,2
"Friendliest owners of any place I've been to, hands down. The food is the freshest of any Mediterranean I've ever had! A friend and I enjoyed a Greek salad and I think it's the New York bagel. I can't remember the name exactly. But it was an onion bagel with smear, lox, onion, tomatoes, and capers. Soooo delicious!",2
"11pm, we were starving and hit this place up. There was about 15 of us. It took them forever to get our food out over an hour , and the bacon cheeseburger was an oversized hockey puck. It was very dry, and I swear the bacon was going to a chip a tooth. However, as hungry as I was I ate this big burger and washed it down with a bucket of beer! Wouldnt go back unless it was the only option.",1
"I had a great experience at this store. I found a absolutely darling Kate Spade purse almost brand new. Lots of bags clothes of all sizes. I thought the art furniture was a bit expensive, but the clothes were well priced. Also the style decor ambience of the store was one of the nicest I've seen in consignment stores no musty smell!",2
"Erica is right, this is people watching central. As an out of towner, I was advised this is where the out of towners go. Beers were 4. It was crowded but not so packed you couldn't move anywhere. The patio has water spritzers to keep you cool on the hot days. Great place to go and wait out the traffic departures.",2
"Wagon Wash SUCKS! The owners are pushy and rude. They did not have my brand of dog food, Evangers White Fish Sweet Potato, they made me feel that I was stupid and tried to sell me on one of their brands. The homemade treats have sugar, which is horrible for your dog! For food and treats, I love Oliver Annie, for a good dog wash, try Smelly Dog!",1
"We fell in love with Pho in San Francisco, where we found it Gluten Free for my daughter who has Celiac Disease. The owner made Gluten Free Pho and ensured no cross contamination. She was aslo able to eat the spring rolls but, not the peanut sauce. We all liked our respective Pho. We had great personal service. We'll be back.",2
"Greg the bartender ignored us for 10 mins . Then when he finally decides to serve us after serving everyone that came after us, he gives us these half filled cups. WTF Greg. If it werent for the 99cents frozen bailey ads outside we wouldn't have even walked into this place. It's small, it smells and it's full of old people trying to play beer pong ",1
"Cafe Luna is lovely at lunch time, with tapas at dinner. I haven't been for dinner in a while, but it was great when I went a couple of years ago. There's patio seating iice weather, and an intimate dining room otherwise. Cafe Luna is at the corner of 4th and Green in the funny wooden building either go up the stairs from Green and turn to your left, or enter from the side entrance on 4th.",2
"Is there a place in the theater O does not drawn you in? Are you not a little afraid at some parts of the show? For yourself? For the Performers? Ar you not thrilled by the feats shown before you? Are you not connected to and moves by the music , visuals, aura, and timing of the show? Aren't you left wanting just a little more each time? If not, then you must not have been to see O.",2
"Really great shop. Tons of fabric. Lots of patterns for quilts,purses,bags, and clothes. Samples on every wall. Kits precut for you. They also had a large clearance section. There is classes too. Staff was very attentive friendly. And didn't mind lots of questions. One problem I live in L.A so I will only get to visit 1 or 2 times a year.",2
"These guys did 2 paver jobs for me, we did most of our own landscape installation at our homes but I would rather hire someone to do the pavers and these guys did a fantastic job for a great price. I was able to get ahold of Dave right away and his bid came a few days after he met with me. He mostly works out of the east valley and completes his jobs in a timely manner.",2
as always found this place thru Yelp for breakfast places during my recent Vegas trip. nI'm not usually a big fan of franchise place but this place wasn't that bad. Their breakfast options were good.love their biscuits and the chocolate dip that came with it. ncoffee was good. nservice was great. too bad we couldn't try all their chocolate items in their menu.maybe next time,2
"Can't stop thinking about this place since I went two weeks ago. I know I was rather tipsy when I was there, but I do remember the food being great and the service being even better. Darvey Sp? was our amazing bartender! I woke up the next morning afternoon with my chicken wings by my side and they were still yummy. Thanks Darvey, Darby.you catch my drift.",2
"It's my first time here since they opened this location and I really enjoyed my visit! I got my usual, house special pie, and it was delicious as always. I was seated in a great spot .I'm not a sports fanatic but I was able to view 4 TVs and I'm sure all of the major games were on display. Overall great, pizza and vibe. I'll be back!",2
"This really is a fantastic place to live. Everything about it is beautiful, plus the management team takes care of every issue immediately. I've never had an issue with anything. I love the location too, right by the light rail, and all the restaurants in walking distance. nThe pool is awesome during the summer, and you meet a lot of people. Definitely the best apartment place in Charlotte.",2
"Awesome walk in place for a bite to eat. You order up at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The atmosphere is going for an island theme, and the waiters are very nice and helpful. The food is really, they also have your average burger and fries, which is fine for me! Had never tried fries with thousand island and now I love it.",2
"Love the margherita pizza. EXCELLENT crust, thick sauce, but could use a little more flavor maybe some more oregano. Otherwise a great pizza in every way. I taste some garlic in the crust that gives a great Pop. Excellent draft beer selection. The bartended with the beard was awesome. Very knowledgable on the beer.",2
"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. It got one star because of the wine and I brought my own. Never have I ever experienced terrible service like this. Our server Katie was ""annoyed "" to open our wine, take our order and had a terrible attitude. our reservation was at 8 15.oh we are still here waiting for food! Pathetic.",1
"I ordered one of the ""premium "" chicken sandwiches. It was absolute trash. I couldn't choke down more than two bites. The chicken was tough and the whole thing generally kind of greasy. Fries were really bland. I guess I should have known better. I'd rather stay at home eating a tin of wet tuna than spend money here again.",1
"Best beer selection for the price that I've ever been to. Great rotating selections. Really, the only place I will regularly go out to in Champaign.other than the new BREWERY! It does get crowded on the weekends, but the crowd tends to be not obnoxious, so I don't mind. Really, just go in and try a different beer every time and you'll be happy.",2
"I called Carl's about 8 00PM on Thursday evening as my heating unit stopped working. I could smell something had burned out , figuring that it was probably the motor. David the service man called me back in about 5 minuntes and came over in about twenty minutes, replaced the motor and the price was more than fair.",2
"I will never again use this pizza place again in my life. I work at a nearby business and I decided to try them, Lo and behold they always charged me more than what the specified amount was. This was not an isolated incident either this happened multiple times. Always ask for a receipt if you decided to eat here other wise they will take advantage of you. DO NOT GO HERE THEY ARE THIEF'S,",1
"Have been to this place approximately 5 times in as many years hoping the service will get better. Tonight was the last time. 2 hours before closing and everything in the pastry case was packed up. The employees were sitting on the back counter chatting and didn't appear the slightest bit interested in helping us. Turned to my friend and said ""that's it, we're leaving "" and vowed never to return!",1
"Our first time taking the training class! We were extremely Impressed with LEAH! Just after one class, we learned so much about the behavior of Akira, our deaf Pit Bull and what commands we need to work on. I highly recommend her services to anyone. Leah is not only Knowledgeable, she is Very PATIENT!",2
"Opening night. Good comfort food. Staff was very attentive and Steve was extremely friendly. The fried chicken was delicious juicy and the breading was flavorful. The choices for sides were diverse and very tasty. We tried 6 sides the favorites were mashed potato, Mac cheese, fried Brussels sprouts. If you like bread butter restaurant, you will like this pace too.",2
I'm sitting at the bar now I would never in my life tell a server that my plate tastes like dog food. Buy if I ever had the nerve to it would be at the Park place pub. Ordered a yuengling and a chili and had 2 bites and almost yakked. These people are theifs. Go to Giant Eagle and get a 1 can of soup you'd have a better meal.,1
"Such caring management. I had the Facebook QR code and I guess the numbers weren't working and he managed to work his magic and hook us up. Usually we get margaritas when we come for lunch but it's dinner time haha. nThe bowls here are jam packed with delicious veggies and fresh cooked meats. My absolute favorite chipotle nHeads up, the lines get loooong!",2
"We stay here every year on our trips to Vegas. We have received excellent accomodations, and service each time. We like the fact that it is off the strip just a bit. This way we can ride the shuttle to the strip, but when we've had enough we can come back to a nice place and escale the madness. We also enjoy the fact that it is just across the street from the Palms, another of our favorite places!",2
"The food here is rather decent Northern Chinese style. Their beef pork pancake, fried leek dumplings are quite authentic as I originally was from that part of the region in China. Service are exceptional from the manager if you happen to speak mandarin. Decent portion and reasonable price. We almost visit them once a week even I live in Glendale which is around 1 hour's drive to Tempe.",2
"No, I don't go to school here, no I do not have kids that do. But I love their theater group and plays they put on! It's very impressive for a high school theater, and the kids are very talented. We've seen three plays here and loved each of them! I recommend going to at least one to see what new talent is there.",2
Went to dinner the other night and the service was horrible. Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes. The waiter was talking to other staff like we didn't even exist and the manager there is clueless. Would definitely not recommend and this is not the first time this has happened.,1
"Went here on vacation for the view and the ambiance. Extremely pleased at the atmosphere and the food quality was excellent. There is nothing like sitting on the patio and watching the sky change colors. The Sea Bass was cooked to perfection and the filet had a good flavor not like a steak house, but good . If you like wine they have a decent selection.",2
This ol gal is gettin run down. Its still one of the bigger parks in the city but every time I go its littered with bird poo and trash. The rides and rentals get no use and the lake smells toxic at times. If you work the afternoon right it can still be an enjoyable experience as the park is huge with many different areas.,1
"Just arrived home after 6 days in Vegas and thanks to the Platinum, my wife and I had a great vacation. Everything was exceptional and we'll definitely be returning. The Solitaire suite strip view had soooo much space and was very quiet. Loved it. Only negative. free wifi was in 3 specific areas of the hotel. A hassle at times.",2
This was exactly what we were looking for.a nice comfortable place to have a few martinis on a Sunday afternoon. We had to be in SQ and had a few hours to kill. We didn't eat but the martinis were good and reasonably priced. Music was at a tolerable level and there were a couple of flat screens to watch the DBacks on. Best part was the complete lack of douchebags and hipsters.,2
"I love this place! It is a great place to sit down, drink a couple cups of coffee and crank out some work for grad school! And even if you don't have homework, it is a good place to come relax and catch up with friends. Everyone is super friendly, the place is very clean and creatively decorated. Highly recommend going here!",2
It's been years since I've been to a PF Chang's and it's safe to say I won't be returning. The food was very salty and the only redeeming factor was the manager granted us gift cards to make up for some poor tasting food they like to call 'cuisine.' If only we could have applied the gift cards to our tab since we don't plan on ever returning.,1
"Hotel is undergoing remodeling, but don't let that stop you from staying here. Best location in the city. Spotless. Staff is happy and extremely accommodating. Restaurant has good food. Breakfasts are awesome. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Warning hotel is centrally located and surrounded by pubs. Short walk.",2
The 1 star was for the food the rest was for the serves. I made the same bowl twice and it could not have been made more different by the cooks. Not to mention the fact they took my not even half eaten bowl while I was making the 2nd one. They say you go some where for the food you go back for the serves well I won't be back.,1
"This is a decent place. They make fresh tortiallas, there's a little taqueria. It's fairly inexpensive. There aren't a lot of workers running around so if you need something you may have problems getting help. The grocery store is pretty inexpensive and they have a good selection of food. Don't forget to stop and get some of their fresh salsa, the guac is delicious.",2
"It has a cozy dining area that was easily able to seat our party of five. I'm no Thai expert, and the food was decent, but it was unremarkable. I had the beef pad thai it was a toss up between that and the green curry which was greasier than I had anticipated. The service was friendly enough, but not very proactive on the beverage front.",1
"Huevos rancheros and bottomless coffee for 8! Service was lightning fast and friendly. Newspaper was current. Ingredients were fresh and delicious. Nothing fancy, but the sauce, beans and eggs were all made fresh in house. Coffee was bland but inoffensive. Great breakfast before a day of shopping the vintage stores along Seventh Avenue.",2
"went to 808 sushi for the first time yesterday and was very amazed! i LOVE the happy hour. I believe the best thing on there is the garlic chicken and the poke, YUM! the staff is very friendly, feels like im back home in hawaii! Just writing this review makes me wanna go back for the happy hour. i HIGHLY recommend this place ",2
"Hello, nI had the pleasure of helping this team of great stylist in redesigning there new website and some promotional video's. nThese guys are defiantly one of the best salons out here in the west valley, expertise range in all areas when it comes to taking care of your body and making it look good! nDefiantly a spot to visit and make it your salon you can call home!",2
"Now just called ""Native "", not sure why they changed it to that, kind weird. The shrimp pizza is the best! Their wings are very good too, so enjoy a nice cold beer, watch the game and have some good pizza. The staff here are friendly and attentive. Always friendly. Desserts are Ok, nothing to rave about. Stick with the pizza wings and beer!",2
"I was at the cafe side of this restaurant. The ""breakfast sandwiches "" were pre made and disgusting. It was a stuffed croissant filled with mostly cheese and scrambled eggs not very much and chunks of ham. I don't like ham, but there was no other choice if I wanted eggs, which is usually what people get with their breakfast. I could only eat half of it and had to toss it.",1
If you want to feel a LOT of pain use their hair removal service. When I visited this place it was my first time using laser and I was naive enough to believe that laser hair removal was a painful thing. Shop around and you will see that there are other providers with much better equipment that is NOT painful at all. Do not use this provider. Avoid at all costs!,1
"Great Pizza, Great Price, Great People. From street view this family owned pizza shop would not have been my fist choice, but I was being treated so I did not object. The white pizza was really good, I couldn't get enough. The seats were not very comfy and the decor is nothing to write about, but they made up for it with their service!",2
"so good, love coming here! so quaint and great food. we always save room for dessert nutella and banana's in a calzone crust with vanilla ice cream yum! The service was good, we could tell it was slammed for just 2 servers to manage on a thursday, but good thing we were in the mood for a leisurely dinner can't wait to come back!",2
I have been a patient of this Medical Group for over 10 years. The doctors and PA's are the best anywhere. I had a heart problem diagnosed due to the PA remembering that heart issues were in my family. It was all taken care of within one month. I am ever so grateful. I think they are the best and would not go anywhere else.,2
The store isnt laid out well no signs to guide you to the escalators. The clothes are crammed in and you have to squeeze between aisles. Its not a comfortable shopping experience. Ok so why three stars? Because the customer service is top notch. I had such a problem the day before at Fashion Show and these guys gal put them to shame! Giving them a fourth star just for their help! Give them a try!,2
"The best late night food in Pittsburgh. The food is good, it tends toward fried and salty but that's fine. Portions are ridiculous. I love mustard, and by far the best mustard I've ever had was here. The pizzas are done well in a brick oven. But even if you hate everything else, the beers alone are worth the trip.",2
"Loved the chandeliers all around the hotel! The multi levels have plenty of shopping dining options. Everything was clean. Casino was nice. New modern. You can see the outside pool bar area from the Strip. It is in a great location on the Strip you can see the Bellagio's water show from the hotel. It is located next to the City Center, as well as the other newer hotels.",2
"Excellent steak and seafood spot in southwest las vegas. Inside the silverton casino, Twin Creeks offers an upscale dining experience with affordable prices. The service is typically very good and have never had a bad meal there. I like their prime rib, filet or scallops. Reservations should be made as the place is usally full.",2
"It's a typical ""Italian "" restaurant I would say a step below Olive Garden because they're around the same price but they don't give you endless soup or bread sticks I've given this place a lot of tries but unfortunately I can't make myself to like it! The food is a bit too salty and there's really nothing special about it other than their cutesy dish names.",1
"Went for the Van Gogh experience one screen wasn't working and those entering the area weren't told not good! I enjoyed viewing listening it was interesting and a different experience, but come on, museum, don't be charging extra for this exhibit when it isn't 100 working! Appears this is a museum for kids most adults I know wouldn't be interested very much in the permanent exhibits.",1
"These guys are talented energetic fun engaged with audience and have a real passion for Motown. You have to like Motown to enjoy this show. My parents 65,67yo and son 7yo loved the show and danced. I admired the group's passion and talent. There was a 50 discount for military. One of the few in Vegas to still give this type of discount. Thank you for that.",2
"Yikes. So, the first room I checked into had black mold on the ceiling of the bathroom. The room they switched me into had a malfunctioning A C unit that didn't work, but did leak water all over the carpet. The 3rd room was actually in decent condition, but was about 200 feet from the interstate. The gaming floor is limited, but the dealers were pretty nice.",1
"This place is amazing. It was eight bucks for an 11 inch pizza with all the toppings that I wanted on it. Super good pesto, fresh mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes and spicy sausage. I was pretty surprised when I walked in that I was the only one there. I really hope this place blows up because it's freaking delicious.",2
"They gave us the darkest table in the place. But the rita's were flowing and I forgot about it. I had the cuban sandwich. It was great, but I think he lost half of it on the way to the table. It was cut in half. O.K. Who has the rest of my sandwich? Then we went and got a picture taken with the parrots. Woo hoo!",2
"I have been shopping in this particular location since I have moved to Henderson, NV. I have NEVER been so humiliated until today. The customer service manager named Lynne B. was RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL. I am disappointed to see a good company raised such a disgraceful employee. I hope this matter will be resolved as soon as possible!",1
"Pretty hit and miss. Spring rolls were mushy and tasted like they were frozen. The two cocktails. My thai and lady boy we took one sip and returned. gross. nAmazing noodles with pork. How are these classified as Thai? As my wonderful girlfriend said ""worst thai food I ever had "". Waiter was cool and effecient. Like the vibe. Hence the two stars.",1
"Well just called in Bannerman's bar to pick up two tickets for BEASTO BLANCO. nlove the band! nSo here I am Thursday 30th January at 12 50pm. It actually busy. Not bad prices today , kronenberg u00a33.70. I just love it here. Chilling out at the moment. Think I might stay for a while. nGive it a try!",2
"I discovered OneWay on jury duty, really good BBQ, lean and tasty on its own, plus delicious sauces, and I loved the hush puppies super fresh, crispy on the outside, sweet on the inside. They validate parking in the deck right there, enter off 4th street where it say Juror Parking and follow the signs. Eat local!",2
"There are so many reviews of Changing Hands, I could not possibly add anything more to say. One of my favorite places to spend an hour in Tempe. You can find me sprawled out on the floor in front of the cookbook section.if you see me, ignore the fact that I'm drooling over the pictures of food and just pass me a tissue.",2
After having a decent breakfast at another location last year I decided to drive up from Buckeye 1 2 hour on Monday 12 01 14 . Waited in line for a few and when it got to be my turn the gal behind the counter immediately said we are not serving breakfast. I said why not. She said it is past 11. I said what time is it now? She said 11 03. I had already been waiting in line.,1
Was there for a half hour and was not attended nReceived a mediocre greet and was told I was to be helped but wasn't I left and never returned because they ask me to return later and I was like I come to purchase something and leave money and they were to busy a key tip don't turn down money hire more friendly reps,1
"I have been craving Wild Thaiger for a year now last time I was in town they were closed . The flavors are perfectly blended, the food is artistic, and the food choices are unlike that I've seen at two other Thai restaurants I've eaten at recently. Their Thai Iced Tea has to be some of the best I've tasted thus far. Its typically quiet which was perfect for girl's day out and chatting.",2
Kitchen staff was not wearing gloves. They were rotating between cleaning and preparing food without washing their hands. They also had a fowl mouth and was swearing so loud you can. Hear them at the counter. I tried to speak with the manager but he dismissed my concerns. The only helpful and amazing individual that was helpful was the young lady who ran the cash register.,1
"Great cappuccino! If you end up in terminal 4 in gates C11 C20 definitely stop by! The staff is great and you even get a real barista steamed milk foam leaf on top of your drink. I wish these places would skip the Splenda and start carrying some stevia sweetener, but the sugar in the raw gets the job done.",2
I used to go here in my university days. The food is pretty good and it's open 24 hours. A good place for a late night snack. The Pittsburgher and pastrami were my favorites. I went to one in Ft. Lauderdale recently and it was a total blast from the past. You can read my dish reviews at http www.dishadish.com restaurant 26845 Primanti Brothers.,2
"After eating lunch next door, we opted to try Mad Hatter for dessert. Cupcakes are small and overpriced, 12.94 for 4 cupcakes. Nothing special, tasted the same as grocery store or what I make at home, no better than Duncan Hines. Save you money, make 2 doz at home, buy a gallon of Ben Jerry's, and you'll still come out ahead!",1
This is the only pet store I go to. I love that they are NOT a chain and the staff is extremely knowledgeable about everything. I have been going here for 5 years and they always remember who I am and how my dog is doing. The homemade treats the pizza slice is too cute! they outsource in make my little guy go crazy! With recent recalls too I completely trust their products.,2
"Older casino on the strip. If you are going to the strip, you should hit the big flashier casino to get the full Vegas experience. But if you are going for a smaller laid back feel, you might as well hit one of the local Station casinos or The Orleans. Cleaner and more up to date. This casino definitely looks like old school 'has been'. It needs some serious updating.",1
"It's an experience. To recognize people's faces after a hard day of work all waiting for the casino to return them luck. What a way to spend your life in Arizona. nThe spectacle of lights, blinking in your eyes, giving you the sensation that you should finalize. nThe weakness in your knees, The cigarettes making you sneeze, your buddy hitting the screen, makes you feel like cashing in.",2
"Tough location to make a go, but the food is good. I had the Gyros Pita plate. The meat was extremely tender. I personally liked it better than the Yanni's nearby although Yanni's has some delish fries . The staff are friendly and eager to please. The food was good and appropriately priced. Good to have in the neighborhood. I will definitely go back.",2
"Ocha used to have good food but something changed and now its one of the worst. Location was always sketchy but the food was good enough to make up for it, until now. The food is sub par and the service is so so. nUpdate we drove by Ocha today and the health department has closed them down. Hopefully they can return to the Ocha we used to know.",1
My rating is high because the morning crew is fast. I have visited this location for nearly a year. I don't have to ask for a napkin with my food and if I'm in a hurry I don't have to go inside. The afternoon on the other hand is usually a hot mess. Slow drive thru and the other day they royally messed up people's drive thru orders. Mine was free for the wait and inconvenience.,2
"I finally decided to give this shop a chance after driving by it all the time. Keelah gave me a great haircut and she was nice and friendly. 5 Star is not that far from my house, so I will continue to go to Keelah. Plus, she gave me the razor line up and took her time doing it. Please stop by and give her your business. Thank you.",2
"I have sushi almost every day, and this place is a paradise! Fresh sushi and sashimi! Authentic Japanese food, including yakisoba, sushi boats, amazing shrimp tempura and good deserts! Order Number 1 Sushi. They speak good English, yet most of them are Korean. They are funny and happy! Best sushi place I'm Vegas!",2
"My friend and I were recommended to have the dinner here. The food was awesome! Love the Lemongrass Shrimp basically is kind of like Fried Shrimp Cake . Also the Lobster Soup was so good with extra Citric taste we both loved. Don't forget the Thai Ice Tea! Love the environment, services and design of the restaurant. The prices was surprising reasonable too for Vegas!",2
We went to the place and loved it! Food was great menu and service was great. Went back a second time and it stated going downhill from there. Ultimately the final straw was I got a burger and the cheese was straight from Walmart! Wonderful Kraft cheese. It was horrible. We have not gone back since. We use to love this place now we aren't going back. Steer clear!,1
Took two suits in as I've lost weight. I knew as they were pinning me that they were excellent at their craft. The staff is very friendly. I picked the suits up and they fit better than ever. I wear suits for work so I took two more in and they were happy to see me back. The attention to detail is outstanding.,2
"Man, Village Inn. is the best. Came here twice in the last two years not from the area and definitely made a point to come in on Wednesday for free pie, y'all! Seriously who can beat that. Had the strawberry banana french toast once and then a dinner entree another and they were all sooo gooood omg.",2
"Great sandwiches and more importantly some very important urbaecessities within NoDa. The wine selection is great, the beer selection is small but varied. I would recommend they use some of the empty space in the store and fill'er up with more beer and wine choices other than that I have zero complaints.",2
"I would have given it 0, but the Web site wouldn't let me. Has anyone who has given it more than 1 star ever really eaten BBQ? This is the McDonald's of BBQ. Texture and flavor both questionable. Sysco? The fact they charge as much as they do only makes their pitiful joke that pretends to be real food that much more pathetic.",1
"Kicking a bad fast food habit of mine and have finally started to experiment with all this stupid juicing stuff I have heard so much about lately. Yelp led me to this cafe and wow! I am impressed. Fresh, light and DELICIOUSNESS. I came here for juice but they have so many other healthy options I'll be back to try the rest of the menu!",2
WORST BLOWOUT EVER! Had to come home and completely recurl my hair. Cannot believe I paid 60 for this. If you want a great blow out. Go to a proper blowdry bar. Also got my makeup done. Also had to come home and touch this up no eyeliner was put on me which is ridiculous since I asked for a dramatic eye. Save your money!,1
"Made my quarterly visit to The Belgo last Saturday. There's always a few shows that delight. Among my favorites this time around Bettina Forget, Anne Ramsden at Galerie Sas, Joe Lima at Galerie Nicolas Robert, a gorgeous Giacometti print highlights the Galerie Roger Bellemare and Galerie Christian Forget group show. nI may make it a monthly visit!",2
"Disgusting! We got a groupon and that prompted us to try it out. It was super dirty. The lifeguards don't do anything except yell at you for sitting too close to a wall or tell you to move your tubes. There are not enough tubes, so we waited forever to get one and the. Had to wait in line. For the slides. The wave pool was dirty and falling apart. Gross. Will never be back.",1
"First time here, friendly staff, great service and equally great food. The guacamole was awesome. The decor is very quaint and the the carne asada was good. I would definitely recommend it, it was a great deal, especially with the coupon I found on restaurants.com. It's a little far from where I live in the southwest, but the friendly staff and good food make it well worth the drive.",2
"If you can make peace with the fact that you're going to pay casino floor prices for this food, it's really a good option for lunch. I had a simple lunch a club sandwich which was fresh and delicious and served with fresh greens with a nice vinaigrette dressing. I would definitely eat here again. The service was fine and it was super busy during the lunch rush .",2
"We were visiting from out of town and stopped by about 4pm on a Thursday no wait for a table on the great deck with a view of the city and rivers! We only got drinks, and they were good. Service was OK. If the view wasn't so good I'd probably only give 3 stars, but it was a beautiful day to sit outside with a drink and the view.",2
"Good LOCATION, seems it has gone down hill. Buffet don't waste your time, McDs style chickeuggets with sweet glaze they call that ""Sweet Sour Chicken "" no joke. Staff at front desk were nice. We would have stayed some place else but all inclusive package was good, although frobt desk staff needed help with check in. Slots are poor pay outs. Housekeeping were friendly.",1
Bad nWait time is like 30 mins. nAfter that until food arrives 1 hour. nMultiple servers taking care of 1 table so you can see they bring your food to someone else. nSide of fries on dishes were dry and dreadful. nDoesn't worth the money and wait Good nThey are flexible to change the ingredients on menu. nStaff friendly. nGood view if you sit outside.,1
There is a reason this place is five star! Here is 5 more! Great service. Delish food. And reasonably priced. Where we else can you get a filet dinner with two sides for under 30 a person! Portions are very reasonable and enough to make you full. Steak was cooked perfectly. And nothing to complain about. Perfect meal.,2
"This place is rude. The girl on the phone has attitude when I told her I wanted to change location. Don't rent from here it's a waste of money. I asked her to change my location to the park and she said it will be an extra 50 and she will take two hours away from me so I cancelled. Then when I cancelled she said ""fine, I'm going to charge you 25 "" I'm furious because she was so rude.",1
"We absolutely love this place! Not for the health food crowd, but definitely for people who do not mind pounded, fried meat and giant beer. They rotate between 4 5 soups and each are delicious and come with every dinner or you can opt to get a German salad for about 2.00 more. It is impossible to leave this place still feeling hungry.",2
"This place rivals Thai Taste for the best Thai food in Charlotte. Monsoon has a huge menu that offers pretty much anything you could want to eat, and even options for picky eaters. Monsoon is large so you rarely have to wait, and they have a number of people working so the service is quick. The mee krob here is some of the best I have ever had.",2
I really liked Kiva Han as it was my concentration hideout for a couple of years. the food and drinks quality are way better than what is being offered in the craig street area. the staff there are friendly.and most importantly it opens till LATE. I'm taking one star off due to the slowness in preparing the food the tables aren't always clean.,2
"It may have been a 4 star when it first opened, but that is no more. nEverything about the room was so tired, worn out and dirty. Even the ncurtains were badly stained I don't wanna know . Soooo smoky. The Rio ndesperately needs an update of the rooms and ventilation. Also, would be nice to have the pool open later.",1
"The course is beautiful, but the service is terrible. I have tried booking a tee time that I won with the golf pro and he is not responsive at all, never returned my calls. The time was drawing near the use by deadline and they just ate up the clock till end of year so they wouldn't have to honor the commitment. I am not sure I will ever play there again. Chris T.",1
"The best 5 dollar Chinese food around! I come here regularly for their lunch specials. You can get a very tasty Mongolian beef dish with white rice, egg roll or crab puff for under 5. They have about 14 lunch specials to choose from or the extensive a la cart menu. It's no frills dinning at its best.",2
"It's an ok breakfast place. The place is overhyped. This is no different than what I can make myself. The coffee is ok. I was disappointed they did not offer real cream with it. Instead, it's organic milk only. The hash brown were mushy on the inside. The waffle is nothing special. If you want some quality breakfast, go to Butterfield's.",1
"Saturday night was packed but still enough room to walk around without being shoved and pushed too much. We had VIP all night so that was great. The music was good so was the atmosphere. Everyone was friendly including the workers. They were extremely kind. Oh the crowd here is a lot more mature than el hefe, probably another reason to like it.",2
"I concur with MS. The inside is like a Denny's or Applebee's and doesn't fit with Vieux Port. The food was OK. They were open on June 24th, Jean Baptiste day, when a few other places were closed. I had the Osso Bucco, which was pretty good. The service was reasonable, the price was OK, but just like a Denny's or Steak n Shake you pay the cashier on the way out, which was slightly surreal.",1
"Have been here twice so far and both times, food and service were excellent. Chicken pita sandwich comes with fries and the gyros plate comes with salad, bread, and fries are amazing. Their plates are very, very filling so you'll have enough to take to go if you'd like. Small and quaint place with a friendly atmosphere. Would definitely recommend!",2
The pool is insane. It states it doesn't open til 10 but what you need to know is that you need to be down there at 7am to get a chair! I went down there at 10am and there were no more chairs or towels. The slide is the best. The pool is waaayyy to small. if you're planning on spending the dsay at the pool. go somewhere with a larger pool The service within the hotel is great. Very friendly staff.,2
"Even though I was there 8 years ago, i'm still giving this 5 stars. During game days the bridge is closed off to vehicular traffic making this a pedestrian only bridge, adding to the gameday atmosphere leading you right to the gates of PNC Park. Now if only the Bucs can put a winning product on the field.",2
"Chase just closed my account for no reason, I went to deposit a check at an ATM and it said to contact customer service, they said I ""posed a risk "" couldn't tell me why just told me my account was suspended and that they would mail me what was in my account within 7 10 business days! Didn't know they could close your account without notice or reason, ridiculous!",1
"I always bring visitors here. Love the sauces for the fries, love the burger combinations. So yummy! On a couple of occasions, I've had problems with the service. You know, situations where you're convinced the waitress has completely forgotten you and ""dashing "" is looking more and more tempting. The food and location make it worth coming back, though, and giving it 4 stars.",2
"Wow.what a birthday! My friends and I had the best time and the best meal! We started at the bar with specialty drinks and great appetizers for happy hour.then on to our dinner table for flash fried dungeness crab, short ribs with mashed potatoes and several other entrees. I could go on and on.but I'll end with dessert.smores! Loved my birthday!",2
"Great service and great cookies! Like others have said, the cookies are very affordable. I also had two cake shots, one was slightly dry, but I did order it at the end of the day. Also, the service was great! I believe it was the daughter who served me, and she was friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely recommend!",2
I've been dining here since 2002. The food and service has always been perfect. I've enjoyed 2 New Years price fixed meals here and my guests are always impressed. One day I'll really splurge and get to the chefs table for an amazing experience. Amazing oysters! nGumbo! nand of course Emerils bbq shrimp!,2
"Been here a few time and until today had OK service. Well today I was told that my jeep was extra dirty so I would have to be charged an extra 5 bucks. That's right, bring your extra dirty car pay the extra dirty price. So now I am at Danny's Family Carwash not getting charged extra, but less because they took your coupon. thanks",1
"We've beeot happy with the food choices at the Wynn in general, but that has now changed with Sinatra. The Best Is Yet to Come. yeah I know lame. but we enjoyed it, cocktails were fabulous, service spot on and the food was great. Pricey as the norm for Vegas. Can't put a finger on why not 5 stars. but it is what it is. We will definitely be back!",2
"Beautiful view, terrible food. Go for drinks and avoid the food at all costs. I have eaten here several times and every time it gets worse! This time, I ordered pizza and I took a bite and it was frozen! If I wanted red barons pizza, I would have stayed home. Asked for pepperonis, charged .50c and there was one pepperoni on it. Waste! These owners and food staff should retire.",1
"My wife and make this place our weekend breakfast stop. Great breakfast food. Their beakfast skillets are really good and the french toast is great. I havent had great luck witht eh lunch items, so I tend to stay away from those. Not that they are bad, but nothing to rave about. But, if you want a really good breakfast check this place out for sure!",2
My husband and I happened to be in Montreal before Christmas and most restaurants werewfilled up with reservations. But then we discovered Al dente Trattoria and were we ever surprised. Great pasta spaghetti and fettucini plus homemade sauce and rapid courteous service added up to a delicious dinner. We will definitely go back. Our compliments to the wonderful chefs and owners!,2
"This was a much bigger venue than I had expected. That is not meant to be negative, it was just shocking to us when we arrived. We saw Roger Daltrey perform there and had a good time. The drinks were pricey, but that's Vegas. This was one of the cleanest venues we had been in and we really enjoyed easy bar and bathroom access. We would be happy to see another show here in the future.",2
My friends and I were so not even impressed by Jet. was not what we expected at all. 1. Too crowded. n2. I was charged for the wrong drinks. n3. Bartenders were dicks and didn't know how to make drinks. n I ordered 2 drinks and I was charged for 3 drinks that were not what I ordered at all! n4. Just wasn't feeling how dark and weird it was. NEVER AGAIN!,1
This club is small compared to all the other big name clubs in vegas. The guys at the door think they are god. They only let people in who have a ton of money. If u are going with men it is impossible to get in without paying 50 dollars. So if u want to get treated like dirt and come out of the club broke go to Prive.,1
"Had lunch today, ordered a pastrami on rye, sandwich came and was very fat and salty and the meat seemed like it was sitting in a Luke warm steamer for hours. I wouldn't recommend their meat thought it was awful not worth any price. My wife and I are visiting Scottsdale and have eaten at a bunch of Jewish style delis and this was the first one that was not worth returning to.p",1
"Went there last night to eat for the first time and was rather disappointed. The service was great, the food, just ok. The hamburger reminded me of the animal style In Out burger sauce and fried onions . The patties were from frozen, the fries from frozen. Nothing special. To be honest with you Culver's, Smashburger and Five Guys have much better food for the same price. Probably won't go back.",1
"The service was was very attentive and friendly, but the food was.exactly how Yelp explains it, ""meh. I've experienced better. "" It did the job as to get food in my stomach but it wasn't the nachos I've ever had. I did love the fact that they had BBQ chip nachos where the chips were made in house though!",1
"WORST BUFFET EVER! Not even worth 6.99, which says a lot. The food was so salty I had to drink 6 glasses of water just to begrudgingly choke it down. They only have about 10 dishes to chose from, with only half being what I would classify as edible. I would have been better off walking next door to Walgreen's and buying pre packaged sushi.",1
"It was done beautifully, but the show wasn't as flashy as other Cirque show's I've seen. It seems to be the red headed step child of Dragone. For the price of the tickets yay military I would definitely choose to see Ka. The acrobatic feats were impressive but the show is definitely on the mellow side. Costume and all the acts melded beautifully.",2
"I don't usually give bad reviews. The only reason I'm putting a star here is because of how nice the waitress was. I ordered a Tom Yum soup dinner format. I was very disappointed, not by the broth but by the rawness of the chicken and the noodles. I saw the usual line for Kazu on my way here and I told myself i was making a hood move. I guess I was wrong.",1
"My family has visited here a couple of times. Each time we have been here the food has been terrible. Everything is just above room temperature and it all tastes exactly the same. Is it just me, or are chinese food restaurants buffets becoming all the same? The food items that were once breaded and fried were mushy well, for that matter, everything was mushy.",1
"This is definitely not a Peruvian restaurant, because they only serve a couple of Peruvian dishes. The service was good but the food was not. The chicken was extremely dry, I think it was from the day before. The arroz chaufa was not good at all. The only goo thing were the plantains and the tostones were delicious. The arepas were too dry too. I dont think I will be back at all.",1
"Not good, stay away. I was very close to dishing out a 1 Star rating but I decided it was worthy of two, I am careful how I dish out the 1 star rating. Food was bland, not much flavor in anything. They claimed chicken was all white breast meat but it was more like mystery meat to me. Place was near empty, not busy at all yet we still waited forever for our food.",1
"Ralph the owner does awesome work, that's all there is to it. Had a relatively easy job for him washer and dryer . Sadly it was 113 today when I had him move it. He did an awesome job! Very quick, very professonal! Ralph, if you ever read this, thank you so much! You took a huge load of stress off me!",2
"After leaving a previous poor review, I was consistently contacted by upper management trying to redeem themselves. This restaurant is not near my home but I agreed to try them again and was promised they would send a certificate for dinner on them at our convenience. However, it has been over a month now and I have yet to see anything. I am still VERY unsatisfied with this company.",1
Came here around 12 30pm Food was good but not great. nFavorites were the pastas. The meats were ok. Flank steak had minimal flavor. Mashed potatoes with gravy were average. Ribs required effort to try to get the meat off the bone. Desserts were ok. Overall would not come here again. Aria buffet was better.,1
"Incredible restaurant. The food was spectacular, the view of the strip was wonderful, and our waiter Tyler has raised the bar for great service. Try the lamb chops and ask for Tyler, you will not be disappointed. The yogurt martini dessert was a wonderful surprise ending to our lunch Tyler's recommendation that it tasted like a cheesecake was spot on. What a find!",2
"Awesome pub, friendly staff, beers are all good and big selection. The American IPA on cask was excellent. Smooth with a slight creaminess texture on the palette, unique for an IPA. They also have cider and whiskey for those looking for other options. Never had the food but looks good! Definitely a great place if your in mile end.",2
"DO NOT EAT Sushi HERE! It's only 1 step above gas station sushi. We tried it for the 1st time. All of our sushi was cold, service was poor, selection was limited the rolls only had names but no descriptions of what was in each roll. If you want great sushi go round, I suggest you go to Seksun sushi. It's only 10 minutes away everything is great there.",1
"The only thing I like about chains consistency. At a buck per doughnut it is steeper than what's offered elsewhere. This location has a drive through not sure how I feel about that. I mean you should at least get out of your car and walk up to get your doughnut, but that's just a personal opinion. If it's working I guess people want it and maybe some Yelpers will be interested to know that.",2
"Sehr guter Italiener! nDie Pizza wird mitten im Restaurant vor den Augen der G u00e4ste zubereitet und ist super lecker. Der Service ist gut und die Preise angemessen. nEinziger Kritikpunkt Tische und St u00fchle im Freien h u00e4tten vor dem Essen abgeputzt werden k u00f6nnen. Deswegen ""nur "" 4 von 5 Sternen",2
"Classic food vs service. Food was great. Service not. Had to seat myself then wait five minutes to be approached. Bartender didn't know how to make a drink and told the server ""No mixed drinks "". That's a waste of a good liquor license. Then complained loud enough to be heard when she tried. Supposedly she was a co owner. Sad. Probably family. That's all for now.",1
"Sorry to inform everyone this location is closed. Went there looking for my favorite place to eat in Vegas, only to be floored by the empty room with a sign stating a different restraunt will be opening soon. Good news is there are still other locations in Vegas that feature the HH, the n Quad, the Plaza, and the original on Sahara.",2
Some kind of NASTY smell comes from this place. you can smell it out in the parking lot and all over the shopping center its in. service is slow and all the little high school kids that work there are rude and have no regard for health or sanitation. how about we try to put gloves on once in a while. that would be lovely.,1
"We've eaten here twice now once we ordered takeout pizza and once we ate in their dining room. The pizza is very good cooked in a wood fired oven and has very fresh ingredients. Pasta and Lasagna were also very good. Garlic bread could use some work and dining room is small, but overall we hope to dine here often in the future.",2
"Ryan and AZ Auto Doctors rock. My Pilot a c was shot and the dealership wanted about 600 more than what Ryan quoted me. I saved that money and I'm now a loyal fan. Lately, my son was buying his first car and we had the auto doctors check one out. It saved us from buying a used car that had 1200 in repairs. I highly recommend AZ Auto Doctors.",2
"Part of the great pho quest of 2012. I love me some pho and Ha Long Bay does it right. While there are plenty of other places to get a steaming bowl, this is some of the best. It's always well seasoned with a good noodle offal broth ratio and seriously fresh garnishes. n nAs soon as I can pull myself away from the pho and try more of the menu, I'll be sure to update.",2
"This place is discustingly dirty! Looked like someone hada food fight in there icecream on the walls Not to mention getting served by a "" chick "" with earings in her lip allover that was discusting I should have walkd out the minuite she said can I help you! omg! not around food please! the icecream sucked it wasnt even cold! and the strawberry shake had no flavor to it! never again!",1
I was considering signing with HealthNet for 2015. They list my provider in the directory for 2014 and 2015. Guess what.my provider did NOT accept HealthNet in 2014 and is not doing so in 2015. Is this some type of game playing to make potential members thing their doctor accepts this plan when in fact they do not?,1
I come here quite often for sushi and at times for Chinese food but either way this is my go to place for sushi and Chinese food on my side of town. The servers are nice and quick. It's a nice little place for some quick sushi or Chinese food. Out of the nearest Chinese restaurants I'd recommend this place.,2
"Whole foods whole paycheck. Another overpriced trendy, gluten free, pesticides free, gmo free, lactose intolerant, allergy free, dye free, organic, wanna be hipster, supermarket. If you want similar type food and a great price I recommend sprouts. Similar atmosphere, similar prices, without ripping you off.",1
"Don't bother. Far too expensive for what you get two dollars per small botlle of water? Really? No wait staff, no booze, bad sound, terrible music choices.I planned on booking a room for four hours, spent barely an hour and a half and went to the bar next door instead. Won't be going back. They need to learn what good private room karaoke is, there are plenty of examples just sadly not in Arizona.",1
"Love this coffee house. It's where I always go when I'm working mobile. Wifi, good seating, and a great variety of drinks and some pastries. The last owner really added some personality to the place. Ownership has recently a few months ago changed hands, and the new owners seem to be pretty nice guys. Hopefully they keep it up!",2
"Craft beers are entirely excluded on the regular Happy Hour. Young girl working bar didn't understand why we declined to drink something else and left. What a joke to have a somewhat diverse taplist and then completely omit an entire segment of the customer base on regular, daily happy hours. Our group will drink elsewhere at Desert Ridge for happy hour. So many choices.",1
"we got a combo plate that came with ribs, pork shoulder, briskets and chicken. the deal was good.it also came with 2 sides.all this for 22.99. The problem everything was dry.the only thing i enjoyed was the beer and the free bread that came with the meal. they only got 2 stars because the waitress was nice. my husband is crazy about bbq and he couldnt even eat 30 of this plate.",1
"Do not buy trees from this website. I bought 3 Sky Pencil Holly trees from Fast growing trees on the online website. The price was 40.46 per tree. Less then a week later the price dropped to 50 off. The trees are currently being sold at 26 per tree. I called the company to get a price guarantee and they refused, quoting 'perishable goods'. They just lost all my business from my family and friends.",1
I had been looking for a good salon in Henderson that was not going to cost me a fortune and I found it today! Jen knew exactly what to do! Picked a beautiful hair color and style and I will be going back to see her. Their BB products are really good too. I love Redken colors that's why I went there. Everyone was friendly. They have a 50 massage for 50 minutes I will be taking mom to!,2
"The hotel was very clean and super comfy, We got upgraded instantly, and the staff was amazing with the amount of crap they were getting from 4 young ladies who didn't go through the proper channels to book a room. The buffett was one of the best I have ever been to in vegas and the winning didn't hurt neither.",2
Always busy! Selection of veggies are ok. Selection of fruit is a little below average. Otherwise it has everything you'd expect from a chain grocery store. Main complaint with this location is that the organization of aisles and products are not logical. You often see items in multiple locations because the layout of the store was clearly not thought out.,1
"Totally awesome experience. We really enjoyed ourselves and Gaetano came to the table and was very cordial! He even gave us free calimari. Every time we go to Vegas, we drive to Henderson just to eat there. NOTE HE flies his seafood in DAILY from Santa Monica Seafood. YUM! PS use the Restaurant.com Coupons for a great deal!",2
"This sucked! It shows on their website a nice party bus but instead they provided a big CHEAP bus, with NO music playing! They had the radio on and mostly commercials played. And when they say open its BULLSHIT! Unless you think a cheap bottle of Popov vodka and cranberry juice is open bar. EWE! Then the clubs were still over crowded and you still had to wait in line! SOOO NOT WORTH IT!",1
"Since when did a wine place become a kids place. Went with the lady on a sunday at about 10 45. By noon we were surrounded by moms with 2 3 kids all over the place. One even had a bunch of baby food with her, Tacky! Other then that, place is great. Had the butcher block. Def be back. Hopefully this time its not ""bring your kid day "" at the wine bar.",2
"Zero Starts if I could! If your going to Vegas and plan to stay at Circus circus Just Stay home! Worst place on earth! Drinks are nasty! Place is dirty and stinks! Hotel is super old and just plain cheap. Not to mention we got the best room available and was so disappointed! Never again, Next time we will stay at Rio or Another hotel casino!",1
"I come.here at least once.a.week for my mom, I moved from.new york and found this place to be pretty amazing everyone is polite. The manager is so cool n down to earth n the at manager. A lay with dark blind hair usually working v the veggies n register had exceptional customer service. I def tell.everyone to check this place out",2
"For an Asian supermarket, it's overpriced. Sriracha chili sauce, large size 28 oz is 3.99 here but at SF Supermarket on Spring Mountain Decatur it's only 2.79. 99 Ranch Market is conveniently located within Chinatown Plaza but I think they rely too much on their name recognition over keeping prices low.",1
"We have been going to ah so for years. We have always liked it but it is even better with the new owners. The owners are very hands on. The remodel makes it feel more spacious. Sushi is fresh and everything I have tried on the menu has been fantastic. Not one bad thing to say about this place. Oh, the filet is the best in town.",2
"There really isn't anything special about this place. It was a default lunch location for people in my office, but in reality it sucked. I would end up not eating rather than going with everyone and eating there. Everything I've had there was greasy except the salads, which are so so. I'd rather eat at home than eat here.",1
Your typical overly sweetened Americanized Oriental food. Everything tastes kind of the same and it's all sweetened to a terrible level. Pricing is high compared to the food quality and portions typical of the Scottsdale fake Asian restaurants. Drive down the street to one of the many available small Oriental restaurants to get much better food at half the price.,1
This place is horrible! Rush you to order get mad when you can't understand what they say because they can't speak English properly. Plus they're rude! Went there and they obviously didn't train well. Got accused of stealing when your staff doesn't know how to slide a card and give a receipt properly? Go somewhere else that is way better!,1
"It's nice to have another beauty supply store in the area, but wen we walked in, they really didn't greet us. Then finally someone asked if we needed any help, by then we already realized there prices are alot higher than Sally's. And we felt like they were following us around like we were going to steal something! I won't be spending my money in this store!",1
This is as good as it gets in Arizona. We had a great time eating lunch in the really lovely place. Joe who owns the place chatted us up and was just great. He made us a great expresso drink and charmed everyone at the table. It felt like I was in LA or San Francisco. What a great little place! I only get to AZ a few times a year but will make a effort to stop by every time.,2
"Visited twice on our 5 day trip to Edinburgh. nAmazing attentive service, delicious food, service with extensive menu knowledge I am gluten free vegan and had an entire page of items I could choose from. My husband had the spicy beef w veg, I had green curry w tofu. Had red curry 2nd visit just as good!",2
Ehhh.definitely doesn't compare to encore beach or wet republic. It was adequate. Definitely was expecting better especially for the fact that we had to have girls with us just to get in. The place is pretty small. Lots of old people which definitely was a buzz kill. Nothing really stood out. The DJ was playing random mashups. No one dancing or really having fun. I probably won't be back.,1
"Tried this with some friends and had a really great time. The party buses were awesome and the hosts give you free drinks I think we had vodka . Best parts are you get to hop several clubs, bypass cover fees, and cut the lines. The only down side is you don't get a ride back to the pick up location so you'll have to either walk back to your hotel or take a cab.",2
"You can't really go wrong at Spago. The staff was superb and the food was really good. I was totally bummed that the Wedge Salad was taken off the menu it was one of my very favorites that I look forward to every time I'm in Vegas. Of course, the price was just a hair high for my comfort zone, but it was good nonetheless.",2
This place really brought me back to my youth. I also liked that they had newer machines as well. Cool place to spend a couple hours. Something I didn't know before going is that the whole place is run by volunteers. A person has to be pretty passionate about pinball gaming to fix all those machines for free. Thanks PBHOF!,2
"Eh. Eating a sausage, egg and cheese on an asiago bagel right now and I'm so unimpressed, I'm taking time from eating to write this. It tastes like fast food. Not at all what we expected. Got the 2nd star for the staff that was very friendly and efficient. Certainly not worth over 8 for two sausage, egg and cheeses.",1
"Been coming here since it's opened and I'm still impressed with the consistency and friendly atmosphere. Our bartender Lori is always smiling and never ceases to amaze me with her knowledge of cocktail concoctions and ability to make them great. The food always taste well prepared and fresh, never been disappointed.",2
"For the price of the food we pay it not worth it. The bread was more tasty then the lobster itself. there were chuck of lobster in the bread but the flavor was bla6 "" lobster roll w meal 28 The Mac and cheese taste good but the bits of lobster didn't add much to this dish. nMac and cheese w lobster 14",1
"I used to like Gallo Blanco untill they canceled my reservation, never will I set foot there again. It was a fiedtrip to reward my honors seniors and juniors. They cancelled the day before. It is already hard to plan outings for our students since all paperwork has to be completed 14 days prior. For the manager, chef and owner to do this is a slap in the face.",1
"Uncle bears is pretty standard as far as breweries go. The food was what you would expect, filling and somewhat greasy. The service was great, she was very patient with me wanting to try multiple beers before picking one that I liked. It's also pretty cool that they allow dogs on the patio! San tan and four peaks are better, but overall it wasn't a bad place.",2
"Disgruntled and uninterested is the best description I can give to the services provided by the bartender waitress at this location of Garcia's. I was sadly disappointed. Maybe you'll be more fortunate if you come at a different time. I showed up for happy hour on a Tuesday at 3pm. The food was decent but not good enough to overshadow the unhappy, unfriendly server.",1
"We were told by the concierge that they served brunch on Sat, so we went for that. However, when we got there, they only had lunch. The food tends to run around 20 a plate. A cup of tea was 4. When we received the food, it was greasy and overfried. Not very tasty at all. Overall, we left highly disappointed. Maybe they are good for drinks, brunch, or a late night snack, but lunch was a bad idea.",1
"Came here on a Wednesday during happy hour with 4 other people, greeted by the hostess very and got a table outside like we asked and got drinks very quickly. Our waitress was very good kept out beers sangrias coming and the food came quickly. I would recommend anyone coming to fountain hills to visit this place!",2
"I bring all my tourist friends here because it's a BIG show on the Strip, a million bucks in costumes, some great laughs, and many WOW moments when the performers put in so much energy and heart. My faves are Liza, Cher, Brittany, and the HOT costumes on those gorgeous dancers! I've seen this show six times and it's always a blast. Love it!",2
"Very much enjoyed this show. My 4 yr old laughed herself silly and my 7 yr old enjoyed it, too. I loved the social commentary and pseudo social commentary. We enjoy the music but beware the cd's are different than what you hear in the live show. Not comparable to Cirque de Soleil totally different entertainment. It's very nice that the performers come out for photos and autographs after the show.",2
"Looking at the star rating for this place I was shocked. I love Blanco! It's one of my favorite Fox Restaurant Concepts. They have fabulous house margaritas and tons of beers to choose from. I recommend the carne asada tacos, they are consistently good. The rice there is awesome. Blanco is always a go to place for good food and good atmosphere.",2
"My wife and I started going here before Christmas almost every weekend. They usually have something going on like photographers, massage therapists, and they even had a Santa Claus for kids around Christmas time. They have great breakfast sandwiches, smoothies, and coffee of course, It's a great neighborhood spot!",2
View is awesome. Music ok. Dancing next to g ma and gramps? Not so sexy. Came before and it was decent then. Came back a second time with the wifee and had to defend why I recommended the place. On top of that had to pay a 20 cover for her and 30 for me. Thx Voodoo Lounge for messing up my street cred.,1
One of the best places with delivery in the midtoworth central area. Curry Chicken is a fave. Prices are great and the food is delicious. I've lived in the area for about 8 years and Chen Wok is a great dinner when you don't feel like cooking. Online ordering through Yelp would make it easier would give 5 stars if it was available!,2
"I've never stayed at this resort, but I've been here several times to meet clients in the Mbar. This place is a cool spot to do that because it's tucked away in Paradise Valley and the property is gorgeous. Parking is easy with a Valet entrance just off of Lincoln Dr. I like to meet here during Happy Hour 3 6 pm . I will write a separate review for the Mbar. Return Factor 90 ",2
"We liked the prices and choose to take our dog here. I didn't like that I was taking home a wet dog, his bottom was still dripping and because he was so scared I had to lift him into the car. As a result my shirt got wet too. However the staff was nice and friendly. Great prices on dog food as well.",2
"I love this place and the vibe. If you get a chance, book an appointment with Becky! I use to go to places where they'd over cut my hair in all of 5 minutes. Those days are over! Becky is incredibly friendly, talented, and amazing at what she does. Leave it to her to make you feel brand new whether it's cut, color, and or style! I'm always leaving the place feeling beautiful!",2
"My wife and I walked the streets searching for the best pub to watch a hockey game in reportedly Le Pistol and couldn't find it in the evening. We returned days later, with sunshine to aid our search. We found the old sign box pictured and a building with sun bleached ""Le Pistol "" tattooed on its scaly wall but no pub. There is now an Asian eatery where Pistol once stood.",1
"A wheel on my rolling bookbag broke. I'm in law school, so I'm pretty much crippled without a rolling bag for all my books. I took it in on a Saturday late morning and had it back later that afternoon, so I was ready to roll ha! for class on Monday. 25 to replace one wheel, seems reasonable. Service was efficient and polite. Thanks QSR! I'll be in to get my knives sharpened next!",2
I love this place. The caramelized onion and sausage pizza is so good! The pasta and salad is good to. I usually order pizza and a pasta or salad dish and take home what I dont eat. Small place but nice and food comes out really quick. I want to say more about this place cause my review seems small but its simply good eats. Check it out,2
Southern style home cooked food done right. Fried green tomatoes with a dill sauce from heaven. Shrimp and grits which were the perfect blend of creamy and spicy. My husband had the salmon cakes although I tried to talk him into the meatloaf. Hopefully next time we visit Charlotte we will be able to hit this place up again for more comfort food.,2
"We really enjoyed ourselves at RSVP. The place is new so the dance floor is not overly crowded. The decor is very chic, cute chandeliers etc. Crowd was good and not unruly, everyone seemed to have a good time. Age range 22 35. Best of all Awesome bottle service great price bottle service and no annoying lady giving the soap and the lotion in the restroom, I can get my own thank you very much.",2
"Definitely one of the best sushi joints in Vegas. It's really far from my house, but when I happen to be in the mood to make the drive over the only thing I ever dislike is the bill. Not crazy expensive, just not the cheapest place in town. You get what you pay for in this town, it's worth what they charge on the occasions that I do go.",2
"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE! I've used the pharmacy drive through at night and store during the day and both were excellent experiences. By accident I left an item behind in the store after a purchase and the employees, especially the manager and assistant managers, were all VERY helpful in keeping it safe for me until I was able to retrieve it.",2
"Didn't even get to try the food. They were closed, saw a person come out of the place, tried to figure out what was going on and got no explanation. I guess I'm not going I waste 45 min to drive here ever again to try their famous stuffed French toast on the off chance they may actually be open and I'd be treated a little more nicely.",1
"Rick was accommodating to our schedule and needs. Not to mention, he was respectful of our property, polite and professional. He called when he was 30 minutes out and was on time. He did an AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING JOB on our carpets and our furniture recliner, reclining sofa and love seat set ! Highly recommended.",2
"This review is strictly for dessert. I met up with my family for dessert after they had dinner here while my cousin, uncle, and I had dinner at Pearl. I ordered the tiramisu and split it with my mom. It was delicious. I didn't feel TOO fat after I ate it either! I also sampled my aunt's cheesecake which was also delicious. Honestly, who can say no to dessert anyway?",2
We stumbled upon this shop while we were in the area for some other work. The display was so inviting that we had to try something. We had a coconut cloud cupcake and a lemon raspberry cupcake. We loved both. The cream was so light and wasn't too sweet. The owner told us that it was more of a European style selection. We would certainly return and try new flavors.,2
"Rude Staff! We waited over an hour and a half to get in. Worst of all, WE WERE ON A GUESTLIST! Staff is horrible and very discriminatory. I believe a law suit is waiting to happen here. Also, when we were inside the club was at OVERCAPACITY. Staff member said ""We can definitely get sued today, we are at overcapacity allowed. "" Club was not worth my time or money. We will stick to XS!",1
"Met some colleagues for drinks here the other night. We were having a good time, then all of a sudden at 8 45 pm our server comes over to tell us that it was last call.what?! Yep, last call because they close at 9 pm.you gotta be kidding me?! What is this?! Oh well, we paid and we left. Return Factor 10 ",1
"I have been using the service for a year the prices are reasonable and competitive with other companies when the guys show up my yard looks great. The company downfall is HORRIBLE communication with its customers. There is a huge lag time like weeks in return phone calls or emails, and the gardeners arrive at random times. If you make an appointment they will NOT arrive on time.",1
"I was so scared and nervous to have my colonoscopy done but everyone here made you feel very cared for. I had my procedure done with Dr. Amin and he was amazing. He's so genuine and takes care of you really well. He answers all your questions and makes sure you are doing well even after the procedure. If I have to do this again, I know I will. I will definitely go here again. Great staff!",2
"HAPPY CINCO DE MAYO! Here is where I celebrated my Cinco. With 5 rolled tacos, how could you go wrong? The 5 beauties were lined up in a row with quacamole, cheese and shredded lettuce all plopped on top, it was delish! Not that any of these place can boast cleanliness, neither can this place BUT you get it to go. Eat it at home and you are A OK.",2
"They were awesome, I'm expecting and they were kind enough to make me breakfast even though they stop serving it. At a certian time, I didn't get it until 2 but I was more than happy with it. They even misread my order and made sure to remake it and have it sent to me again. Quickly and promptly, Very wonderful service. And I'm all about breakfast at the moment so having it for lunch is a plus!",2
Had them clean my Louis Vuitton canvas handbag and wallet and did a good job. They did an excellent job repairing the straps to my Gucci handbag. The price was affordable starting at 45 and up and much cheaper than other dry cleaners and the shoe and upholstery cleaners. Highly recommend for those of you who need luxury handbag cleaning. They do not do them onsite they use a vendor .,2
"This resto is a nice change from the typical traditional Asian style restaurants in Chinatown. It is Fine cuisine Vietnamienne and it has only one veggie dish. nIT TASTED GREAT. full of fresh veggie soup with noodles, , nice Chicken broth, not too salty. Flavorful I would get the medium size, the large was too filling. nA nice change from the typical Asian restaurant, nice and zen decor",2
"One of our favorite places. Nice quiet place to eat a great dinner. My wife and I had filets that were tender and cooked just like we like them . baked potato was just right . Salad was great . They gave us service that was the best . this is such a great place and we will return . for us, this is the best steakhouse in Las Vegas. We try to go here every time we are in Vegas",2
"You caot pay me money to eat here again. They cannot even cook edamame, it was undercooked and cold. I had to stop eating their sushi in fear I would be sick for work in the morning. Texture and temperature of the fish scared me. Save yourself pain and throw your money out the window. Only plus side was their friendliness in service.",1
Stayed here once in 2006 and had roaches in the room. Now in October of 2010 my husbands company had an incentive trip. 6 people so far have been hit with credit card fraud! The highest victim got hit for a 1200.00 purchase on the same card used to check in. Stay away or monitor your credit after staying here!,1
"Well it's still the same Tropicana on the outside doesn't look any different but on the inside, remodeled did a really good job remodeling they do have a all new pool area with a day club it comes from the hip atmosphere of Nikki Beach club in Miami Florida it's, n looks pretty cool,Looks like a fun place in the summertime, I'll have to come check it out.",1
"Order the sushi boat! its amazing! really filled us up! the hostess was really great as well, she kept checking up on us and was really nice. we first had a small table, and when a slightly bigger table opened up, they we able to move us to accomodate as we wanted some elbow room which was good im very picky on my sushi places, so this place gives the thumbs up to me!",2
Visited Ghost bar back in april 2009 with a few of my co workers. Very low key bar. I was supprise there was no line that led into the bar because usually from my experience with going out to bar clubs in vegas mean waiting in long lines! This place has an awesome view of the strip! I really enjoyed this place.,2
"I am so happy they aren't keeping this crab and scallop ""pot "". It was overly messy and no return of flavor. Better off just having steamed crab legs instead. Overall, Red Lobster is a great place for me to get my crab fix when I need it. There isn't any other affordable place in town to support my cravings.",2
"Just had the rudest worker at the pharmacy. The car ahead of us in the drive thru line took 20 minutes. When it was our turn the tech asked our name, said hold on, was gone several minutes then we saw her grab her keys and drinks and leave. Several minutes later another tech came to the window. When I asked what happened she snapped at me! Like its my fault that their customer service sucks?!",1
"I don't know if all Red Robins are the same but this new location is nothing but a glorified Chucky Cheese. Lots of kids and bad food. I ordered a clam chowder, it was so watered down and yet the chef still serves it. The other dishes we had seemed thrown together as though nobody cared. Didn't feel the love at this restaurant , I will not be going back.",1
"Terrible courses arrived at different times explanation was that there are 3 kitchens so of course we should understand , the advertised shredded chicken came in big pieces including cartilage and a hunk of boiled skin explanation was that the chef says the skin adds flavor , lots of unnecessary fat in the dishes we ordered, and all this with high prices. Go somewhere else.",1
"Don't get the crispy fish that looks at you while you eat it. I guess that's obvious, but it wasn't to us when we ordered it. We really had to pick around the bones and parts of this 30 dish to eat dinner. We also tried some Yucatan chicken skewers and they were fine, but not worth another trip back. I'd rather eat at a Fuddruckers and keep my 60, thanks.",1
"Rudy, the man that owns this store was very nice has been in the business for 35 years. I took a ring in to get it appraised he was professional knowledgable! Cleaned it up for an optimized appraisal! It's a smaller, shop run by him his wife which made it seem in my opinion very personal, attention wise. I had a wonderful experience. Will go back to get my ring sized.",2
"I ordered Food to go because I didn't have time for to fix Breakfast this morning. So I visited Egg Works. I found that Its a bit overpriced. Eggs, Pancakes, sausage, waffles were average tasting. If you can spend time making them yourself at home, I encourage you to do so. Customer service was friendly.",1
Freddie's Nutrition is my usual go to store for protein bars and supplements. Stopped on the way out of LVAC and was disappointed to see their cost on quest bars was way higher than Freddie's. They also don't do discounts on mixed flavors of quest bars. Seemed annoyed when I asked. Will not be back.,1
A great Chinese restaurant in Vegas. The prices are what you would expect for dining on the strip in the Bellagio but too high. The portions are perfect. I had the Eggplant and it was great. Expect to pay for rice seperately. The interior was a bit more formal than expected but we went with jeans and dress shirts and felt comfortable.,2
"I've stayed in W Hotels across the world and this is the best. Great service, rooms, location. Room service is great. It's close to the other hotels, but far enough removed that if you come for an event that is hosted at one of the huge hotels like the Hyatt, you are just far enough away to avoid the hoopla.",2
"Excellent customer service! Seated right away, the staff was very friendly. She brought the cornbread with mouth watering honey butter that just melted in your mouth. I had the steak salad AMAZING! My mom had the chicken quesadilla appetizer it was happy hour, but she couldn't finish it. It's a meal. nWonderful place my mom can't wait to go back. Me too.",2
"Great option when you need to feed hungry kids and don't have time to cook dinner. I always ask to wait for a fresh hot n ready pizza so it's nice and hot when we get home. I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for them to cook a fresh pizza, as they are continually making them. Only cost 5, and I prefer this pizza over greasy Pizza Hut any day.",2
This place is great place to get quick healthy food. The employees are super nice. I used my birthday coupon and my 20 girl didn't even ask too many questions. She honored it no questions asked. Veggies are fresh and chicken is healthy. Brown rice is fresh as we'll. I recommend this to all my friends. And sign up for notifications they are worth it ,2
"I only came for drinks, but WOW did they do a GREAT job with this place! The decor is very urban and updated, but not pretentious at all! I had a melon mojito that was awesome, and a red sangria that was very good as well. The service was on point, prices right and location perfect! Next time, I'll check out the food on the menu.",2
"Fair pricing might even find a great deal! The guy who is always there is nice and helpful. There is so much stuff to look at, I love it! nalthough regret to add they have a bunch of shit outside and it takes awhile to pull out and in. meaning don't go until 11 because 10 you cant get in and don't go at 530 cuz they are hauling their stuff in. other then that you are golden.",2
"This place is the jam! The food was good and our chef was great! It was refreshing to see some new ""tricks "" during the presentation, instead of the same old tired stuff. I'm going back tonight and I expect it will be fabulous again! Oh, and the prices felt cheaper than other hibachi places in town!",2
My friend is in a band and they are basically the 'house band' for this place. It is very spacious typically have all sorts of different bands which is good. The bad thing is the bartenders usually have crappy attitudes and the drinks even just beers are way over priced. If it wasn't for my friend playing there all the time I wouldn't go to this place.,1
"Holy F balls, Friend and I walked in and walked right back out! nThis place was so packed on a Friday night that we couldn't even barely move, It smelled like sweaty balls and everyone was pushing into one another. nI'm pretty sure this place violates fire codes! This place BLOWS hard like Lewinsky. RANDOM FACT nThe first moderightclub began being built in 1886",1
"This place is average. On the plus side it's nice and cheep, but on the downside, it's a pretty gross physical establishment, and the food and drinks are mediocre. The worst offense to me was one night when I ordered a Knob Creek on the rocks and caught the barkeep pouring me a drink from the well. He poured it out and gave me what I actually ordered, but I wasn't pleased.",1
"Had a chance to get back to Java Cat today. Seriously. If you love frozen treats and you haven't been here yet, I am shedding a tear for you. The best gelato I've had, hands down. Both in quality, and creativity of flavors. as a side note, the man and I split a BLT today as well, which was also yummy in that good old classic sandwich kind of way .",2
"Great course for the money! Its location is primo and I love that for a short drive you can feel like you are on vacation. I adore the views of the mountains in the distance and I like that this course is manageable. I prefer the front nine to the back, which is good since I'm usually only up for nine holes. Then its time to hit the bar!",2
"Absolutely fabulous. We shared a prime rib with Fleming Potatoes and it was amazing. We had the cheesecake for dessert and it was absolutely amazing. The wine tablet will pair your meal, wish I knew that before ordering wine but no one pointed it out to us. Other than that it is awesome. Expensive, but awesome.",2
"This used to be good. They changed their menu last year, for the worse. Very few veggie or fish options. Really poor selection for happy hour. Service the last 3 times has been dreadful, slow, unhappy servers. Unlikely we'll go back unless we hear of great changes. It was like eating in Scottsdale very unfriendly, over priced and mediocre.",1
i don't know what this airport has such a low rating. i've been to a variety of airports around the country and this has to be one of the cleanest and most organized ones! the only downfall i see is they need a few more signs to direct people to the correct shuttle areas. we had a hard time finding the rental car shuttle.,2
"I think Over Easy is a very nice breakfast place. Yes, it is more expensive then Ihop and Denny's but the food is really good and has some unique options. I have had in my visits the Dolly breakfast sandwich egg, tomato, bacon on a English muffin , brioche French toast plain and Banana's Foster and the chocolate chip pancakes. Service is also good and overall, it's a nice breakfast place.",2
"I've worked with Neal Law on several projects. Abby has been a big help with putting together tight, professional business contracts. She's made sure that my contracts are logical and cover all the possible bases. I highly recommend Neal Law to anyone looking for an extra set of eyes on their legal documents and rock solid contracts .",2
I love this place because they take you right away and your out of there within 5 10 minutes. My brows looked amazing after I left and almost 2 weeks later they're still looking bomb. This place is on the way home so it's convenient and the price is right. I hope that lady never leaves because she's the best!,2
"As always I had a wonderful experience. Ordering 8 rolls among 4 people is not ideal and a waste of more table space than tummy space , but delicious and worth the . I do agree with previous reviews that there is some redundancy in menu but regardless, pick what you like and try it 400 ways. Love it.",2
" ""ka ka "". It was an Asian influenced dance hard to follow story. I don't know what the reviews meant by a great story. The best parts were the amazing acrobats that were few and far between. We were bored half way thru but much too expensive to leave early! I've seen O and Mystere they were much better.",1
"This location rocks. Always helpful service, and the food is consistently perfect. They smoke that meat until it is falling off the bones. Never hugely busy for eat in service, but the take out side does really well. Typically you don't have to wait more than a few minutes even you if walk in and order. Phone service can be a bit slow on Friday nights though.",2
"An interracial couple I know recently went too Charley's and was treated very offensively by the staff. SHame on Charley's this is 2012. Even if it were 1960, all people of all skin colors must be treated with respect. My recommendation boycott Charley's steakhouse. A business that practices racism does not deserve to be in business at all.",1
"Atrocious service failure to manage a simple breakfast selection of food. Biscuits? Sorry, we're out for awhile. Hashbrown potatoes? Sorry, we're out right now. Fries? No we're out of those too. So I order the panini breakfast sandwich without meat. When I get to my gate, I see the sandwich is also lacking egg meaning it's just the cheese condiments on it . Brilliant folks working here. brilliant!",1
"Food is average at best. Customer service and choice is discouraged. Don't want a fatty potato option in your meal? Too bad, you can't substitute for something cheaper or pay for something more expensive. Never been to a breakfast place before this that didn't let you make it your way within reason. First time here and last time here.",1
"I've been here a couple of times and have always had a good experience. The place was clean with a nice outdoor area. I was there for football Saturday this past weekend, and the service was very good. I would give five stars, except that the person with me didn't love their sandwich. I liked my food though! I will definitely visit the Tempe Bar again.",2
"I love this library! It's very clean and has a crisp, new feeling every time I visit. There is a great children's area with stimulating play tables. There are a few ""quiet rooms "" for people to retreat in if need be. Also, there's is a snack area that's conviently stocked with vending machines and magazines. There is also an outdoor patio that's gated in for some fresh air.",2
"love this bar! did you know they were building one up at desert ridge? just drove by today and saw the sign and a building being worked on.AMAZING so fun and a great spot for it. Food is fun, service is good.great spot to watch games and they usually have some good drink specials so you're not about to break the bank when going there.",2
"All the charm of a Wal Mart changing room with the glitz and glamour of a dollar store. If you enjoy palpable human misery that just doesn't wash off, The Cortez is the place for you. Especially at 2am. While I didn't see anyone smoking out of their tracheotomy hole while I was losing my money at the blackjack table. lets just say I wouldn't have been surprised if I had.",1
First time at Yard House last night. The service was beyond outstanding. Shanna was the best server I have had in the 2 years I have lived in the valley. Her energy was amazing. The food was good but the 5 star rating is based on service. The Steak sandwich was good. the garlic shitake noodles were outstanding. The Smores brownie was out of this world. Mudshark caramel vanilla porter was great,2
Went to Lake Las Vegas and found a ghost town. Place was empty. Only restaurant open at 2pm on a Saturday. We were the only people in the restaurant. I had a Tostada with shrimp which was basically lettuce on a tortilla with 3 prawns. Boyfriend had steak fajitas which were ok. Had a beer and a glass of wine. 80 bill. Thought 80 for an ok Mexican lunch was way to much.,1
"The food was very good! I really enjoyed the pulled pork and beef brisket! I would have to say that it was absolutely finger lickin' goodness! All of the valley must try, it was well worth a 35 mile drive! Best in the valley! The Mac n cheese was cheesy heaven too! Great staff and wonderful customer service! Tatiana was extremely helpful in assisting me in my meal choices! YUMMY!",2
"they need to shut this place down and open a wendys or something.came thursday night, nearly empty, came with 6 other people, waitress got everyones order wrong except mine.friends ordered boneless wings and came bone in they were too lazy to say anything, i asked her if she could take it back and get boneless she said its the same thing as boneless just with the bone.FAIL",1
"The place is relatively cheap, and a nice break from dorm food if you're a student. It has a very retro diner kind of feel, if you enjoy that kind of thing there's a counter with spinning stools and a whole lot of booths . Their chocolate milk shakes are fantastic, and I've always had a good experience with anything they have that comes with eggs and hash browns.",2
"First try, not impressed, the movement of the massage was kinda fast, didn't feel relax, instead of massage all the way to a pressured point, every movement was kinda just till half way. I told the receptionist these problems and they set up my next appointment with another girl, I will give it another try, because the location is very convenient for me.",1
"This is for drinks only. We got the frozen yard sticks. 2 for 30 because it was happy hour. Not a good deal I found out later. I ordered the poncho villa. Gross I hated every taste of it. I had to choke it down. The boyfriend got the frog punch. Not enough booze in either drink but at least it tasted better. Go to Fat Tuesday, better tasting better price.",1
"Went for dinner tonight. Will be last time I nCome here. Food took forever to be served.Steak was warm, potatoes cold. Just about done with dinner when my napkin fell on floor.went to reach for it and saw a roach crawling on it. Beyond disgusted. Have never encountered that in any restaurant before. Needless to say not coming back.",1
"When got my food delivered to me last time I had a feel of sadness and regret after done eating. I do value my felling so I'm gonna skip mediocrity and go somewhere else. It's jut not there taste, flavor, hummos like sand. nOh my god how hard is it to make hummos. They do open late though and that where the xtra star comes inn.",1
"Though their lunch service is really really slow, their food more than makes up for the wait. Plus they keep bringing chips and a fantastic cilantro salsa out, making the wait not seem so bad. The Cubanito is the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had, with delicious homemade bread. It's now my second favorite sandwich in Madison. Their chop bowls are all really tasty as well.",2
I had a terrible experience. My crown fell off a short time after I had it done by Dr. Michelle despite the fact that she assured me it would would last for 10 years. I would have settled for a third of that! When I contacted her for reimbursement she refused and suggested that it fell out because of poor dental hygiene. I absolutely do not recommend. Extremely unprofessional!,1
"We went to Firefly on Sahara tonight. It was so amazing! The service was great. George was our server. All the food was fresh and delicious, and the plates were large enough for 4 people to share each one. We sat outside in seats in front of the fireplace.it was perfect. We go out to dinner and every Friday night to a different place and we will be going back there next Friday.",2
"Amazing. Lost about 35 lbs, my old tailor said ditch my single slacks. I was referred here by a friend, and Habib went through all my slacks and we saved about 10 of 15. The tailoring was great. Since I have brought in several blazers to adjust and they look great. Finding a good tailor, and an honest one is tough and Habib fits the bill for both.",2
"This salon is fun and funky! Megan Roth cuts and colors my hair and she is by far the best stylist I have encountered in Phoenix over the last ten years and i have been to many so called upscale Scottdale salons Megan is qualified and will not overcharge you, she will be on time and give you a great haircut! Go see Megan!",2
"What a disappointment. I went here because of all the great reviews but maybe I went on the wrong day. The greeter was kind, no up sell, cashier was kind as well. Problem is I came here to get my car washed as well. Windshield left full of bugs, rear seats not vacuumed, rear windows had smudges and cup holders left full of crumbs. Really?! No attention to detail or pride in the job they do.",1
"please batter your crab, last time i ate the crab it had no batter it was horrible, i would give you guys a redo on this but, besides that, you guys are worse the sushi rock, i ordered over 100 worth of sushi, and yet none met my satisfaction, please once a sushi restaurant goes bad, it goes bad forever, so redirect yourselves.",1
"Went for a convention and had dinner in the restaurant. So this is my limited review! Did a lot of walking to get from place to place. Convention facilities were above average. Food in the restaurant was excellent. Service left much to be desired, seemed we were in the way and a bother! I love the Biltmore grounds and landscaping was soothing and enjoyed walking the areas!",2
"Ask for mark the security guy! He will make sure to threaten to rip your face off, push you and your fianc u00e9 into bushes for no reason and pick a fight with you for not doing anything! Make sure you just pay for 20 a pice drinks so that they can throw those out as well! If you make sure you take video of everything, he will become a little b ?h and not do anything!",1
"I'll keep it short as when we went there today, we found a table outside. in the sun. on a Saturday and we were deciding what we wanted for lunch from this reportedly great Swedish bakery. n So we had our table, it was sunny, it was lunch time, we knew what we wanted and. they had no bread, on a Saturday, in a bakery, at lunch time fail. n Be yes, two stars, well it did look nice inside.",1
"This is a fabulous park for a quick but good hike. There are a lot of people there, but I like that because I feel a little safer when I want to hike alone. To me, feeling safe is very important. I agree going early is a good idea though, you don't want to be plowed over by people too much I'm going to go again and try a different trail. Oh, and my pups also give it 5 stars.",2
"This has to be one of the best Italian restaurants that I have been to. The portions are out of control. Every thing is family style. Our waiter was awesome. Make sure you bring at least 6 people with you. We had a table for four and ordered a salad, the 40 ounce prime rib, chicken Marsala, and two meat balls. And we have another whole severing for 4.",2
"This is my brother's favorite sushi place! We took him here for his birthday and they did an amazing job making his birthday special. They have this fun multi colored strobe light that they turn on when they play their ""Happy Birthday "" song. It was really sweet. Also, the sushi is fresh and tasty. Their happy hour prices are cheap! My brother loves the ""all you can eat buffet "" for only 20.",2
Dryer fires saved my home they were very experienced and helpful with my air ducts and dryer vents my father had breathing problems and our household always had really bad allergies. I'm so happy we found this company not expensive at all and they helped my family to breath better and the air smells better. Thanks so much I will be using them again in the future,2
"Wish I could take Grouchy John's back to Vancouver with me! We went because of all the great Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. Loved the staff and coffee. I actually work for Starbucks but really am not a fan of the iced coffee, so I like to try out new places if we travel. Next time we're in Vegas I will be back to redeem my punch card! Thanks for the caffeine high, guys.",2
"Excellent German food. Practiced my German with the owner, who was very nice and explained that they make all their own sausages. Very tasty and exactly as I remembered from living in Germany. Had the bratwurst and bratkartoffel. Excellent. Large portions. Nice place that I don't think many tourists frequent. I would recommend if you want an authentic German meal.",2
"This place is a shit hole. There was always sketchy people in my hallway asking for money and I didn't feel safe. My room was dated and dirty. I paid 30 a night and I would say it's worth maybe 19. Half the casino is still Star Trek and other half not, hotel identity crisis. Worst part is when you stay here, you are trapped in the gross part of Vegas.",1
STAY AS FAR AWAY as you can from this place. It's horrible and worst of all the Tahiti Village which is a fairly nice resort right next to it recommends this crap food to its guest owners. REALLY! You can't be serious! The place smells when you first walk in. The food is horrible and I wouldn't feed it to my dog!,1
"Went there late last night, probably some of the worst food I've ever had. On second thought, it was the worst. The only way it would have been worse is if the waiter came over and punched me in the face. The pizza was dough, the soup didn't have any flavor other than the thick starchy consistency. Very disappointed",1
Amazing food and service! The building actually makes you feel as if you were in Louisiana. How many places can say they have an alligator inside? I had the Creole City Pasta and it was delicious. I will definitely be back. Don't forget to try the Blue Bayou if you liked fruity mixed drinks. You won't be disappointed ,2
"I used to love this place, but over time the service has gotten horrible. I have waited for 2hrs and only placed one order.the 2nd order appeared be another long wait.I am writing this as a wait for my masago been 40min . This is the third time I experience back to back extreme long waits when it's not ""out of the ordinary "" busy. It's time for me to call it quites and look for a different place.",1
"Went here on Monday actually next door at Bruno Mali's for the hip hop night, and it was sick. About 50 or so people in the smallish space. Cheap drinks, edgy urban art sale lot of Che paintings , early 90s hip hop think A Tribe Called Quest , freestyling, and an eclectic crowd sum it up here. Check out the cute blondie mastering the turntables.damn!",2
"Krispy Kreme, I was so upset, yet relieved, when you closed all your stores. My self control had one less thing to challenge it, and my stomach had one less foe to battle. Now you're reopened within 5 miles of my house. This is a low blow. Krispy Kreme donuts are good, but the hot, fresh things are like liquid evil. sweet, tasty evil. So I'm really glad you're back, even if I'm mad about it.",2
"How the hell you gonna trust a place to be authentic when they don't even know the difference between ""parmesan "" and ""parmagiana, "" so they just combine them into a made up word. WHAT THE HELL IS PARMASANA? ""Parmagiana "" is a style of cooking. ""Parmesan "" is the cheese you sprinkle on your spaghetti. God! People can be so stupid.",1
"It was time again for our company Christmas party at the Millennium Resort! It's not super fancy, but I always like how the room opens up to the patio area and you have the view of Camelback Lake behind you. It makes for a very pretty party backdrop and they had heat lamps outside as well. nStaff there was great at keeping the place neat and getting rid of plates and empty glasses.",2
"I went to get a facial and don't expect perfect because it is a school but when I went in the room and pulled back the sheet, there were grease or oil stains on the sheets, plus the blanket and upper sheet both felt oily and dirty. They are learning about proper technique and sanitation but putting on oily sheets does not meet standards",1
"Worst restaurant experience I have ever had. After telling us that a cook had called in sick and that it shouldn't be too long for dinner, it took over 2 HOURS to get our food. The Alfredo sauce needed a handful of salt for flavor. We had over a 600 check and the manager barely aplolgized. Sadly I say goodbye to Sergio's.",1
Takamatsu in Chandler is overall way better than this phoenix location. This location charges 1.25 for extra rice a 1.00 per extra side dish. I came in with a party of 6 and of course we ran out of several side dishes since the serving size was equivalent to what they serve a party of 2. The service was also incredibly sloooow. I will not be returning to this location.,1
"Caribbean food, they said. 3.5 stars, they said. Must be good, I said. Now my stomach hurts. 20 Lobster Shrimp Linguine has no flavor. Onion rings are alright, just big and the onion had chewy skin. Orange juice was very diluted with water. Goat cheese burger has a very strong taste for the cheese not recommended if you're not a fan. Shrimp Calpyso is pretty decent.",1
"I would like to thank our fabulous bartender whose name rhymes with Bristina. for being an incompetent, unfriendly, and arrogant bartender. Village pub usually has good service but I appreciate the amazing treatment we received. I didn't know we were at Dick's.on purpose. Get em girl! If she's not there 3.8 stars, her there .8.",1
Food was absolutely terrible. It looked like a child made it. We also were missing food as well. Spent 30 worth of food.called them and asked for a refund and they put me on a long hold. Definitely will not be going back. Was my first time going there and will be the last. Luckily after talking to the staff they took care of it. Make sure you check your food at the restaurant before you leave.,1
"I ordered flowers from here for my wedding and was pretty specific about what I wanted. Not only were they so nice and helpful, the bouquet came out ever better than I imagined. I couldn't have picked a better company to do business with. Extremely professional, beautiful product, and great customer service!",2
"I come here about two times a week, but I have noticed that their prices are steadily going up and up. Not only that, the portion size has been shrinking. One of my favorite plates used to be 4.95, then it went up to 5.95 and now it's 6.95! This is all within a year! Taste wise, their pho is great and so is their fried rice plates. Customer service is pretty poor.",1
I ordered to go here upon the request of the ladies I work with. I was surprised that the sushi was pretty good. Not a bad price for good sushi. I would rather go here than the rotating sushi place down the street. I also ordered tempura udon. It was pretty good for takeout. I would go back. I like that they have other options too so I can take my husband who doesn't like sushi. ,2
"As the previous reviewer Bailey stated nice clean store, brightly lit. I wanted one of those soft cloths for cleaning eyeglass they had none. I had to buy a package 30 count of these wet eyeglass wipes in the foil packs. Also picked up some Rolaids as I ran out, and a comb to replace my missing comb.",2
"Friday afternoon at 4 00pm, only 1 person working the Cashier Cage and 40 people in line. Very poor Management. They do not care about Local's as I've overheard numerous times, 'We dont care about the little amount Local's spend here anyway'. This is the type of classless attitudes and lack of Management from the top that give this Shit Hole the reputation that they have with Local's!",1
This is the best place we've ever taken our cars to. Their customer service is outstanding. It appears that they really like doing what they do because they are always willing to explain everything in detail. I also like that they don't over charge. I completely trust them to be honest and do the best job possible.,2
"The employees are usually very plesent. However, the drive thru is hit or miss. You will either be through in 2 minutes or stuck for 25 minutes. I don't suggest taking the drive thru regularly if you have somewhere to be, like work. I've gotten stuck more than once and have been late for it taking over 20 minutes.",1
"I'm a local, I tell people to go here. I love the downstairs motif! I also love the fact that you can bop around the Palazzo, drink gamble, then go to dinner and the club all in the same place. Eating here is like the start of your night, puts you in the right mood. staff is super nice too! always nice bouncers here, will escort you to the ladies as you push yourself through the hoards of people.",2
This is your typical Bath Body Works location but I find this one to be very well stocked. You know how some of their shops have shelves that look half empty? Not here. It's a small location but the service is always good and they always have what I want or need. Nice products that are overpriced so wait for a sale . Give them your e mail address for special coupons and offers.,2
"We had to book a room here at midnight after having some altercations with our original hotel plans. It was dirt cheap but obviously you get what you pay for.the room made you feel depressed and dirty. However, the customer service at the front desk was great. They were very friendly and helped us out with whatever we needed. But honestly I would never ever stay here again.",1
"Service here sucks. The food is good but part of dining out is to have a pleasant experience. They brought the check WITH our meal, like hurry up and eat and get the funk out. We used to really like the place, they had older staff and it was like going to grandma's for breakfast. Not the same experience these days. Will not be going back!",1
"It was delicious! 2 curry chicken legs with a few, very few little pieces of potato, a side of black beans and a side of cabbage that was WONDERFUL! They only lose a star, because of the price.that small plate. 11.00! I could see 8.00 that's about it! We got it takeout ate it next door at Shadow Ava Lounge.",2
"The food was ok but it was the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. The waitress kept rushing us and bringing us our bill. When we ordered something else she got upset with us and left in a tiff. Their red bean ice cream is also only strawberry ice cream with red bean chunks. When we asked about it they lied and said red bean ice cream ""has a strawberry taste to it "".",1
"I just got a new muffler on my 2000 Honda Civic. Overall, I had a good experience. They were fast and friendly but I felt it was a little more expensive than the other reviewers lead you to think. I spent 312 on a new pipe and muffler which came with a 1 year warranty. All around a pretty good deal at a reasonable price but not a crazy cheap deal by any means.",2
"A gum chewing desk agent should have been the taletell sign of a poor service company. No printed documentation of the rental agreement. Upon return of the car the agent said he smelled smoke and walked away. Again, no check out documentation. Got home and received an invoice for 250 to clean the car. What a scam artist company. I guess they will stay in Las Vegas.",1
"total failure! waited all day for delivery and they were a no show. they did not contact us, nor were we able to contact them either by live chat or by phone.called and was on hold for twenty minutes before being disconnected. did this repeatedly without success. do not use this service. they are a disgrace! would not have given them even one star if given the choice.",1
"Place is overrated. The food is horrible and the service is extremely slow. I ordered two eggs over easy and it took 45 minutes. Our waitress didn't refill our waters or coffee. Additionally the waitresses could of been flirty like at a Hooters. I mean its a topless breakfast place, they should have a sense of humor about it.",1
I loved the fact that they had 24 hour Security In the parking lot and they were visible all times . my husband and I Came m from Florida And Kentucky and Unfortunately this casino did not have the wow facts for me the only thing my husband liked was the sports betting other than that if we were on Vacation We Could haVe Went to the Casino in Cincinnati or the hard Rock in Tampa,1
"I just can't eat at this one since getting terrible service and then going into the restroom only to find it completely devoid of soap. Yes, you know what that means boys girls, none of the female staff had soap to wash their hands either. GROSS! This was a year or two ago and fingers crossed they're better now but this Z Tejas location is ruined for me.",1
The first time I went was with a large group and we all loved our server and the food. And the Bloody Mary bar. The second time I went with a small group. Hated the flavourless cold soggy steak sandwich and the totally clueless server. Everything he described based on which we ordered was just wrong. Not even close to real. I'd say skip it and find someplace else.,1
Went on a Monday night drink specials were OK if a bartender would have taken my drink order. The blonde bartender would rather talk to guys instead of taken drink orders. Ask for a manager and I was told he was to busy in the back of the house. Ask three times and he never came out. I would never go back.,1
Another great Two Hippies concept! We stopped by a few weeks ago to grab a quick dinner and loved it. My hubby had the rice bowl and I had the fish tacos.delicious! I also enjoyed an icy pineapple lemonade.so delicious and refreshing on a hot day comes with a free refill too bonus! . The staff was so super friendly and welcoming to our dog who joined us on the patio.,2
Didn't like it at all. First of all it's totally expensive and the service is preety slow. The fillet minion is nice but the appetizer is expensive . nU need to wait too long at the line cuz u need to make a reservation before. nNext time try to tell that you are the hotel guests maybe they will treat u better,1
"I've gone to Trisha for several years now, and I am always pleased, not to mention feel better, when I leave a session with her. She always knows what muscle to target and how much pressure to apply her intuition matches both her skill and experience. By taking care of me, she makes taking care of myself worth it! Thanks Trisha!",2
Buyer beware. My recent experience with VIP is one of poor customer service. The SR Lender never bothered to call me back or follow up with an email. I left a message with a supervisor. She also never took the time to respond to my complaint. There are many other mortgage companies to pick from so stay clear of VIP.,1
Very unimpressed. The eel and tuna were very fishy tasting. They even forgot the sauce for one of the rolls. The hot mess roll was meh. Not worth the price and the quality is sub par. Fake crab on a 21 roll. Really? Shishito peppers were delicious. Skip this place. There are far better places to eat at Mandalay Bay and far better sushi in Vegas.,1
when i go here i usually get the Grilled pepper jack chicken enchilladas with beans and rice and i really enjoy it. nthe service is fine meaning they could be a little more attentive but other than that its great ni really like sitting outside outlooking the street at night only because its great scenery,1
"Absolutely love this place. Pizza is always fresh and just like New York. I live far away so I am only able to come in around once every couple months, but the owner still seems to remember me every time I am in there and greets me by name! All the guys are super friendly. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants some real New York pizza.",2
"I am only reviewing it as a night club. I did not experience this as a place to eat. nWe spent 3.5 hours here trying to have a good time. The Newest song the DJ played was from 2010, we are in 2012 get some new music. you could listen to any online radio station and find out the new songs out ! nWe complained and he had nothing to say. As we were leaving others were complaining of the same thing !",1
"I like this place, if I don't buy a few clothing items I get at least a few little accessories. They have a very original selection of goodies and they have really cute pillows that I never bought because they are kind of overpriced Anyways, just give it a chance the saleswoman is always very friendly and nice.",2
"This place is terrible. My husband and I had a jacket, shirt, and dress dry cleaned and it was somehow 60. My husband asked what it would cost beforehand and they seemed to have no idea. And the small stain on his shirt remains. Don't waste your time. We used to live in Chicago and so had better options, but will be trying other places and not coming back.",1
Their lunch specials are nuts portion wise. From somewhere between 5 7 you can get pretty much a double portion of a lot of mexican standards. I opted for chilaquiles which were pretty solid and tasted damear as good the next dar when I microwaved them at the office. So that's like 3 per lunch?! Insane.,2
"I understand that you get what you pay for whether it 12.99 or 6.99 but I was throughly upset with the food quality. They had a great selection of processed EVERYTHING! Great for the young, non caring, drunk as fuck type but my day sucked because I felt like crap after digesting that food. If you're going to Vegas and this is the best you can do.just stay home!",1
"49.00 for 12 ounce steak and it does not come with side orders. 3 small egg roll for 18.00. hey, isn't that cost more than macdonald french fries? this place is not good for nonsmokers. smoke from casino goes straight to the restaurant. we smell like smokers and my eyes turn red when we left.our bills for 2 persons was 234.00 without alcohol. now i know why the owner drive a lamborghini",1
"FUN FUN FUN CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP! Fremont St. is THE place to people watch, hear good music from cover bands and street musicians, drink on the cheap, and just explore. The light show that happens on the hour with bands like Queen, The Doors, Don McLean which by the way is awesome singing American Pie with thousands of strangers ! So much is happening on this street you'll forget the time.",2
"My boyfriend and I are TOTALLY in love with this sushi restaurant! The staff is great the venue is cute, upbeat and modern. We LOVE the sushi it's absolutely amazing and always fresh. We eat here at least twice a month and are always confident to take our friends visiting from out of town here because we know they will be PERFECT every time!",2
"After growing up in Montreal, ""Villa "".as I foundly refer to Villa du Souvlaki, is a must when I come home to visit. nThe food has not changed in the 26 yrs I have been going. nThe souvlaki pita is still as good as always, and the silver dollar fries are indeed meant to be dipped in the best taziki sauce in Montreal. nNever disappointed, and always a must.",2
"Don't go there for lunch, service is slow, my order was wrong and there was no attempt to correct the problem. The manager walked past our table 3 times and never asked how our meal was. I've been to other Gordon Biersch around the country and not had this bad an experience. I guess it's typical for Vegas.",1
"We spent weeks trying to catch this place open. Tonight was the night. Come on folks.this was horrible. I cook Mexican better than this and wish I had and for those of you that think its better than Carolina's.I dont even know what to say. We ordered simple. The beans were tasteless and runny, not in a good way either. We will never go here again, ugh.",1
Service was great when we arrive. Very tasty frozen margarita and the chips and salsa was excellent. But all downhill after that. Food was sub par. Tacos were not very good. My son had chimichanga which was stuffed with cheap cheddar cheese. Beans were horrible. Taco salad was not good either. Cheap ingredients. Would not go back,1
They have the worst pizza and wings I have ever had in my life. I had asked for mild sauce for the wings and they arrived without any sauce. The wings were soaked in grease and tasted horrible. The pizza dough was very doughy and flavorless. I would not recommend anybody order food from this location.,1
"What a joke of a company. Absolutely horrible customer service and it infuriates me that I pay these rates for a product service that continues to experience ""outages "" and I cant even watch the channels I want to. An absolute horrible company and it upsets me every month that I pay them for ""service "" because there is not another cable provider in my area.",1
This place would of gotten a good review from me if it wasn't for me sitting at the dealership for hours at a time for 3 days in a row. The 3rd day we came to pick up the car after completing the paperwork the night before and we sat in the dealership with the car sitting out front for 3 hours and counting.terrible!,1
"Peach has returned! I came in today and to my surprise, there was Peach flavor! Yay! They also had banana, one of my other favorite yogurt flavors. The consistency was thicker than I remember from my last visit, which I approve as well, noone likes runny, melted froyo. I am a fro yo fan for real, and Yogurt Ranch, great improvement since my last time in!",2
"If one is looking for where MGM cut corners on city center, look no further than the Vdara. It feels like a movie set, looks good from a distance, when you get up close you realize it is a facade. The carpet in the lobby is lumpy and frayed, there is wallpaper in the hallway. I was far from impressed. No comparison between this place and the mandarin oriental.",1
Food was OK food temps could be hotter . Clean restaurant. Upholstery was outdated. Service was slowwwwww! There was very few people eating here and only one waitress and what could of been a 30 min experience turned into an hour because of her slow response time. I would come back only if the service was quicker Which is customary for a Chinese restaurant and my rice and music soup was hotter!,1
"Was here for EVFN TechPhx kick off party. I've never been before, but heard good things. I wasn't disappointed. They always get a room in the back for EVFN, and everyone was so nice, and prompt with taking orders and getting drinks to us. I only had wings, but they were quite good! They also have a good selection of drafts. Good place I will definitely go back!",2
"My favorite restaurant! Tons of vegan and vegetarian options, my favorites are the kale and beet salad, veggie pizza, tofu veggie rice bowl, and the amazing tofu kabob. Staff is nice, and it's usually pretty quiet and non busy good for conversationalists . Also shout out to this place for making my past two Valentine's Days awesome!",2
"Poorly stocked and ghetto. There isn't really much to say other than watch your back. They are always poorly stocked and the store is a mess, then you need an employee for assistance just forget it. Drive the extra 10 minutes for a better Walmart. The only reason I shop here is because I get lazy and don't want to drive further.",1
"Hands down the best sandwich shop in town. Their signature sandwiches such as the Bobbie and Capastrami are second to none. If your ever in the mood for a sandwich, skip Subway and Quizno's and head to your local Capriotti's Sandwich shop! NOTE Make sure to tip these guys out as they are all very appreciative for the beer money. ",2
i paid 35 to hang out for 20 minutes with a bunch of 50 year olds in parkas. the no camera rule was very irritating. the only reason i would have appreciated this wacky thing is if i could have at least documented it. someone from my group paid the photographer for a picture of all of us. but still. the ice cup was cool no pun intended . and i guess the boots provided a nice break from high heels?,1
"Crabcake eggs benedict in Arizona? Yes! Unbelievers will be shunned, shunnnnnnnnned. I watched the World Cup game with the aforementioned benny and a stellar cup of decaf joe. The servers were friendly and the food was delish at 7 am? yea! . It was too early for me, but the bar had intriguing signs detailing carefully assembled cocktails. Add it to the list, folks.",2
I like many others have heard good things about this place. It must be good of so many people like it that there is a 30 minute wait for a table of 4? We had to sit on a bench in a dark hallway toward the restrooms waiting. Saw several customers attempt to get the bartenders attention only to give up.,1
"I am a resident of Litchfield Park and the Wigwam is the perfect place to unwind. Whether your a resident or vacationer the amenities of the Wigwam are awesome. The Wigwam bar inside the lobby is the perfect destination. Incredible service, great food, etc. Katy, Sandra, and Jaclyn are awesome examples of the ""Wigwam experience. """,2
"Your average GOOD Mexican Cantina. They have all the usual suspects you'd expect and give you fresh chips and salsa when you sit down. Everything seemed very fresh and had great flavor. I'd compare this place with your local high quality Mexican restaurant. While it was perfectly great, I have no real reason to return here unless everyone in my group wanted to go.",2
"I got food poisoning from this place last night. Not only that but the chicken tasted soggy and stale, should of knowot to eat it in the first place, that's how their food usually turns out unless you ask for a fresh batch. But now that I've actually gotten sick from the food, yuck! NEVER EATING AT PANDA AGAIN",1
"We've given up on this location. Food is not good here. Scrambled eggs are not edible, the kids never like them here. Hash brown usually burnt. Omelettes as dry as can be. Coffee is just horrible. Unfortunately, we always give it a try once every few months, but always the same. So we just go back to village inn. It's just better tasting food.",1
"To me this place wasn't that great. I ordered a two piece catfish and the batter was super thick, staff were inattentive and no where to be found. It seemed pretty popular as the parking lot was full. I didn't even eat half my meal before I got a little disgusted for spending the money and hopped up to toss the mess in the trash. I'll pass and stick to Pete's Fish and Chips!",1
"This place does Thai noodle dishes well I never venture away from Pad See Ew, but their other choices also look good . The food is reasonably priced and comes in large portions. It's located in a weird part of town, but if you like good food it shouldn't matter. The staff are very welcoming, and the food is prepared fast.",2
"I came in just to get a gift cards. I waited in what seemed to be a takeout line. The girl was texting on her phone and not paying attention to me, who hadn't been helped. The people standing near the counter were waiting on their takeout orders. I heard one complain that she was 15 minutes over her quoted time. Not a good experience!",1
"My service with Viking pools has been great. I've been very happy with the price, the customer service, and the reliability. I'd recommend this company to anyone. My neighbors use them too! Lastly, they are very handy. They always talk me out of wasting money and buying new equipment, they just fix whateverbreaks for way less!",2
"Loved it! We were staying at the Wigwam Resort and decided to try the Old Pueblo Cafe which is right across the street. There is a gate at the hotel that allows guests easy access to the restaurant. Their outdoor seating is kept cool by a misting system. Everything was great the food, the service and the live entertainment they had weekends. ",2
"Coffee delicious, pastries delightful, ambiance just what you expect in the neighborhood it's in. Place is wonderful, set in once a gas service station, now a coffee full of everything you can ask for, political conversations, to the beginnings of ones novel. Place is definitely one to make the trip for, and enjoy the beautiful hidden gems downtown Phoenix has to offer. cafehunters",2
Food is just like any other Chinese restaurant. greesy and loaded w msg Service here is a NEGATIVE 5. After being seat by the host a server comes along 15 mins later and took our order. Right after that the owners comes to our table and demand us move to a corner table so they can seat a bigger party. Save your money and go to Panda Express,1
"We have been here a few times. It is alright. We are happy to see Japanese food so close to us, but after a few times we have not been back. The sushi is hit and miss. The service is terrible. We had to keep asking for refills. The tempanyaki grill is fun but pricing. For that amount I rather drive further for better food and service.",1
"My family I had such a great time at Mon Ami Gabi. They have a very nice outdoor seating right on The Strip, so we had a great view of the Bellagio fountains right across and the interesting crowd milling by. We were lucky to have such a great hostess. I love their bread, French Onion Soup, Escargots, Duck Leg Confit, and Prime Rib. Didn't get to order dessert because we were pressed for time.",2
"Sooo fresh and yummy sushi! Cute tiny place with super fast and friendly service. Now the sushi is incredible! We had a variety of rolls and loved them all! The tempura lobster was good, but way over shadowed by the sushi and the lychee martinis! The martini's were so delicious.drank 3 and we were still sober I guess that was the only disappointment.",2
"Very good dim sum. Not truly exemplary but it was flavorful and filling without being overly salty or anything. The price was good but the selection was kinda so so I have been told its better on weekends, we went around noon on a Monday and the service was alright. There were only two carts going so it was pretty slow. One of the ladies was also pretty mean. Decent dim sum though!",2
"Great pizza! I came here twice, both times with a Groupon, and was not disappointed. I had tomatoes and really enjoyed their caprese salad. I've tasted the Americana and Cinque Formaggi which were both great. I especially love the atmosphere and the patio is perfect when the weather is right. It is somewhere I have highly recommended since and will certainly visit again.",2
"This was an incredible yelp find. All of the previous posts are spot on the servers are incredibly helpful and friendly, the food was amazing, and the ambience, although goofy with all the masked wrestler decor, was fantastic. Came with Girlfriend and we each got the wet vegetarian burritos. So good! Salsa bar was awesome too. Took the check in offer for yelp no problem. Will def go again.",2
Such a great place! The staff is so courteous. The rooms were kept very clean and smelt great. Loved the older hotel redone to be great again. The pool is salt water and very cool to hang out at. The roof top deck offers amazing views. The restaurant is some of the best salsa in all of Arizona! Great that this is a gay friendly hotel as well! Will be coming back here for sure!,2
"I am a vegetarian and was hoping to have good indian food. I therefore yelped and found out this restaurant. If you have no other option and have to eat indian go ahead! Otherwise just keep away from this place. The buffet had 2 vegetable entree, 1 dal, sambhar, idly, rice and veg appetizer. I really did not like any of the food. Bottom line not worth 15 bucks",1
"Such a cute place too bad we were the only two people there on a Tuesday night at 11 00 pm when we'd made the trip all the way down there from the Strip and it doesn't open until 9 00 and the door is locked until we kill some time waiting for it to ""happen "". It never did. It's very pink and sparkly though.",1
"I moved literally walking distance from Thai Pan about 9 months ago and finally just got take out from there for the first time last night and thought it was great. My husband wasn't in love with his dish, but our app my dish the peanut noodles. yummy were excellent. Definitely going back and would recommend.",2
"Huge disappointment. Years ago Caesar's Place had one of the best Buffets in town. You can image my surprise to find how small it has become now. They did have frozen crab legs, prime rib and turkey but that was about all they had. The salad and side selection was very thin. You can get a nice meal in one of the other restaurants for about the same price.",1
"Small place, maybe room for a dozen sitting customers so i got mine to go. Food is good i think i dealt with the owner, he was really nice all his employees seemed to be in a good mood which made for a pleasant atmosphere the 3 minutes i waited for my food. To recap, good food, nice staff and good prices. 4 stars. Thanks!",2
"The worst customer service I have received in at least twenty years. nThey ignored customers, acted like they were doing us a favor by pointing to where product was available and seemed like workers out of some movie about Russian bureaucracy . nI would drive 20 miles to go to another location if I wanted to use U Haul again.",1
"I love Geebee's. I have eaten there a few times and have never been disappointed. I try something new every time. The food is so fresh and we have always had great service. The potato cheese soup is the best I have ever had. It is not a very attractive business from the outside, but by the time you leave. Who the heck cares, what is inside is so incredible you forget the package.",2
"So glad a friend suggested this place! Family of 4, with two kiddos, and we all were happy with our meals. I had the vegetarian crazy potato, which was a really cool menu item. The place was packed, but the kitchen got food out fairly quickly and there was plenty of outside seating. Will definitely come back, and recommend to others!",2
I recently went here since I always past by it everyday. Well I was glad that I did. I was greeted with a huge smile as I walked in the door. I went in the morning and surprisingly it was not packed. I sat at the counter and was again greeted by this time my waitress. Breakfast was outstanding and service was great. I defiantly will be back.,2
"We came here with new friends recently, and I must say it was a great evening. We all had fish as our entrees and loved all of the different iterations. Appetizers were tasty and a good value. Drinks were generous pours and well priced. Overall, a great place if you want a cozy meal with friends. This will definitely be our go to place for dinners when in the South Hills!",2
"Been to this Olive Garden twice with my family. Obviously if it was up to me, I wouldn't have come back a 2nd time. The salad and breadsticks are always good, but the main courses are seriously bad here. Both times I've eaten here I've gotten sick. Tried different stuff each time, didn't matter. The service is lacking here also. While everyone is nice, the service is very slow.",1
"I love the goofy chicago shit on the walls, and the haphazard menus that dont make any sense all over the walls. It is the first place where I actually felt like it could belong in Chicago. The guy that owned it was obviously from a big city back east, just by looking at him and talking. The food though? Not so good al.",1
 19.99 All You Can Eat Happy Hour Awesome! nHappy Hour is M S 11 30 2 30 and M Th 5 7 where a good list of rolls are half off! nPancho head sushi chef is super nice and personable. The food sushi has been consistently good and of great quality. nIt's definitely one of the best sushi places with an all you can eat sushi option in the Phoenix area.,2
"Managed to have fun both times! That's sort of rare. Club is beautiful. Came here in the summer and once in November. It was chilly in November, but they manage to turn on the heat lamps outside by the pool and the hot tub. One bad thing is that it's pricey, so be prepared to pay! Service also depends on how well you tip.",2
"Just like their other location in Henderson their 2nd location is the one where I had my first Monta experience this ramen is pure crack. This is hands down the best, sticky, greasy, porky, al dente, delicious ramen I've had. Pure crack. I now hit up Ramen, as well as In N Out, everytime when visiting family in Vegas.",2
"Stopped in with family from out of town for the 'voted best in town'? The food was old, we waited for fresh, it was really just old reheated to look like new. The place was empty and the Carolina Panthers were playing.we were the only people there. Bathroom was disgusting.went over to Blackhawk to use theirs.",1
"Periodically I go in search of a good local diner for just a good meal. nThis place is the perfect small town cafe. It's not fancy, the chairs don't match it's just a simple cafe and I love it! nThe food is great, service is quick and friendly and the price is good! nI will be bringing my friends and family here from out of town after a night of too much fun.",2
"Everything on the lunch buffet was great. The dosa Indian crepes that are stuffed are VERY delicious! A person can get full oothing but the vegetarian options, there are plenty of meat dishes too. Leave room for desert. Very friendly staff. Parking near the capital is a little hit or miss but that is how it is everywhere downtown.",2
"My 1st visit was delightful. Service friendly and responsive my request to split the 1 2 chicken meal with a friend was readily acquiesced. Food flavorful, delicious, promptly served. Although I found the broccoli bland, the chicken, garlic mashed potatoes and beet salad broke the flavor barrier. I only wish I had had room for one of their inviting desserts.",2
"This is a fairly small bookstore that does what itv does well. My experience is used books ""like new "". nFor a person who retains some of their books this adds value.Pricing on used and closeouts is good. nTrade in value is slightly better than other buying stores. Selection is very good. Very pleasant atmosphere. A lot to offer over the 35 years as a customer. Will always miss Mill Ave store.",2
Do NOT put your hard earned money into this place. The instructors are good but my favorite ones left after having their paychecks bounce. Some of them have never been paid. This means you may pay for classes and show up one day to find the doors locked. After researching this business I found several judgements against them for not paying their bills.,1
"Had the turkey and brie panini. GREAT tasting sandwich. The bread they use is really good, and the meat on the sandwich tastes high quality and they're pretty generous with how much they put on. The aioli was really nice too. Only problem I have with this place is their sandwiches are waaay overpriced in my opinion. Paid about 16 for a small sandwich that was the cost of the sandwich plus 2 tip ",2
"Great customer service. However they offer the lowest prices if you are trying to sell the jewelry. Was offered 300 for my diamond studs it was mentioned that 300 was a ""very generous "" offer considering the quality of the earrings . nOther pawn shops were offering 450, 700, and 850 in the ""pawn stars "" shop featured on TV . nAfter all I will not recommend this place for selling.",1
"Our group met here for a club crawl by nite tours. We enjoyed 2 for 1 drinks on the patio before, then entered the club. The music was really good. Mix of house, hip hop, and some old school favs. The dance floor was pretty packed, but for a Friday night it wasn't 'sardine' packed. No issues getting in, because of the tour package. If recommend it.",2
"It's wasn't the fact that this place was located in a not so good part of town or even that I received my meal in a food 4 less grocery bag. But I was very disappointed w my meal! The Mac n cheese was watery and sweet, the ribs had no flavor! The best part of my meal was the catfish, which was really good! Overall it was a waste of 16!",1
"Most of the time this is a relatively quiet apartment complex, but there are a few times a year that they have massive pool parties. The noise is so loud that it can be heard from all ends of the complex and ruins everyone's day that wanted nothing to do with the party. nIf you are looking for a safe, quiet place for your family, do not live here.",1
"Heavenly after an exhausting day of pub hopping and castle mounting. The interior was soothing, and the tables outside overlooked a steep, twisty street straight out of Trainspotting. Add a steaming pot of herbal tea, pleasantly dressed yuppies, and accomodating waiters and you too will have sobered up in style!",2
"I usually prefer giving my money to local venues, however, this is my FAVORITE Starbucks. The baristas are always in a great mood and smiling. They also make an effort to remember their customers, which is difficult to do in such a large city. The only downfall is the fact they share parking with Pei Wei, often making it difficult to find a spot.",2
"Honestly it's just for good drunk food. I'd never eat here if I didn't just come back from the bars, and even then I've dealt with some sketchy people in the past hence why there's always a police officer in there . Pizza is good, gives copious fries, decent cheese dip for the fries but hot dogs. Terrible!",1
Been here a few different times and each visit I get a different weird experience. It's either great service with a well informed knowledgeable server or a complete train wreck that results in something being offered for free. I feel like this place is so close to being a great part of Charlotte and a unique restaurant that everyone can be proud of.but it's not there yet.,1
"Nice break from the heat. Went twice over the weekend. Waitresses were very nice but the manager with the soul patch was a tool. Had it not been for his lack of hospitality, I would have given it a 5 star rating and would have spent a lot more money! Since they don't care about repeat business, they won't have mine!",1
"I really like this place, especially for happy hour! My boyfriend and I stop by here every couple of weeks and this place never disappoints. The staff is always friendly and nice and the food is also good. Try their carne asada tacos in their happy hour menu, they are pretty basic but good. I also like their chicken tortilla soup.",2
"I recently visited Dickeys and observed the food staff and overall exp , The food is way to over priced . There was two of us and THE TOTAL BILL was about 40 dollars . The food portions were small and they tried to make it better by offering half melted ice cream and pickles . The staff was amazing and very upbeat but that about it . Lower prices equal more reoccurring customers .",1
Our Host went and had a drink at the Bar. nOr waitress brought us half our order. nThe suppose manager of the restaurant brought most of our order. nThe waitress took 20 minutes to bring the check. We should have sat at the bar. The view of the men bartenders would have counter acted the bad service. No wonder there are a lot of vacant spaces out here!,1
"Molly is a hair genius! I am Ecstatic about my cut and color! The whole staff is friendly and upbeat. The entire experience is brilliant! Molly did an amazing consult, had tons of ideas and options, and took the time to explain everything she did and everything she was using. The Wash House experience is also amazing! Love love love it all! Can't wait to go back!",2
This is a quaint little pub with great atmosphere. The beer selection is standard and the food pub like but I recommend the sweet potato fries. The last time I was there the table next to us was freaking out over the fried pickles so we got an order of our own and they were all right. Definitely a good hangout place!,2
Go to this place if. nyou feel lucky they will not give you what you order. nyou feel like being abused and looked down on they will tell you they do not see anything wrong with your order. nyou do would like run to the cleaners the lid was not properly placed on my coffee so it spilled. nyou want more abuse call corporate and complain. What do I know I am just a stupid customer.,1
"Love the atmosphere here. The wine list is, of course, impressive. The food is great also. My hubby recommends the grilled cheese w white cheddar and brie. I thoroughly enjoyed my bruschetta and potato leek soup. This place is prefect for a quick drink, dinner, a night of drinking.really any occasion.",2
"no where to dance, the security pretty much pushed us into a corner and were really rude to the point that we left early. I'm not sure if this is typical of trendy type clubs but yeah. They kept assuming we wanted to be at this persons table when we were simply dancing near the table b c there was no room. I will never go back to this place again.",1
What has happened to Summerlin?! And thank you hearthstone for following suit to terrible service and false expectations. Overbooking mutiple tables on reservations and the food has to be something amazing to make up for this. Always excuses and everything left to the imagination because someone with a reservation 30 minutes after us walks in way before us.,1
My friend lives right around the corner and after a little shopping we decided to stop in and grab some food. She ordered a turkey wrap and I got the turkey bacon melt. Both were made when we ordered it and were ready in about 3 minutes. Mine was perfectly hot and the flavor was excellent. Gotta show support for local business!,2
"Located on the upper level of a large strip mall complex on the edge of Vegas' Chinatown sits Veggie House, a completely vegan, Chinese dining experience. Amazing food, reasonable prices, friendly waitstaff, and healthy portions. We ordered the spring rolls, fried wontons, and lettuce cup appetizer. Main dishes included orange chicken, beef with snow peas, walnut shrimp, and pineapple duck.",2
"Pleasant surprise. Unlike San Francisco's Rebel, The Garage actually sticks with its theme in terms of decor, attire, and drink names. It felt clean and modern, and I appreciated the drink prices. I taught my three friends how to play shuffle board. While it is a bit out of the way from the Strip and the Fruit Loop, I'd say it's well worth a stop.",2
"NOT a fan of this Jack in the box at all! I went through the drive through and all i wanted was a milkshake. I was clear with my words and she had no idea what i wanted. She took forever to respond too. After she found out what i wanted, they werent serving it. This has happened a couple times now and its really annoying that their employees cant understand whats on the menu that i am ordering.",1
"This food truck is a lot of fun. Great shaved ice, just the thing for the hot weather we enjoy in Las Vegas. If you see it cruising around Las Vegas get in line and order your cool treat. They have an incredible variety of flavors and flavor combinations so you can go back hundreds of times and not have tried everything on there menu. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",2
"Since I've been working in Charlotte off and on the past 12 weeks, we have been coming here at least once or twice a week. Friendly wait staff, good food, reasonable prices, and quick service. I really like the selections of ""regular "" and kosher foods. The kosher salami is one of my favorites as well as the beef brisket NY style sandwich.",2
"This place was awesome! Took my lady to Satara for our 2 year anny. VERY ROMANTIC! Tons of wine to choose from, we are more lovers of beer, which they had a great selection of as well. Food was fantastic. scenery was nice. Water wall is a very nice touch. And i almost forgot, my new favorite thing cucumber slices in the ice water! great idea! Wanna make her happy? Make a reservation to Satara!",2
"Great food, great service, solid ambiance. We ordered the Valentines Day's wine menu special and it was just an overall fantastic experience. The attention from the wait staff was amazing for as busy as they were and for 125 per person including wine 6 wines 6 mini courses what a great value! They even threw in a round of cocktails while we waited for our table.",2
"The cool thing about they Rhythm Room is the variety of people there. nAlmost every time I go, there's a girl on the dance floor.on roller skates! Then there will be a few punk types, rockabilly, country, of all ages. That's the kind of place I like. nAlso, if you get hungry, there's a guy out back in a trailer selling pork sandwiches. Not the greatest, but perfect after a night of live music",2
"What a great way to spend an afternoon. We took my 14year old son and one of his friends and they had a GREAT time! nSuch a variety of things to do, they even have an arcade full of educational but fun games that we didn't find until we were getting ready to leave. My parents purchased several annual passes so fortunately we will be able to go regularly and check out all there is to see.",2
My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! Great food and the best service Anywhere in this town. The staff really want to make Sure your meal is Perfect and always make me feel so welcome! The singer pianist is wonderful too. This reastaurant has the perfect blend of sophiscication and comfortable atmosphere!,2
"The food was decent get the mesquite fries the sweet potato ones are covered in sugar not quite my idea of good sweet potato fries . the burger was alright. server wasn't too amazing and it wasn't that busy when I was there, so they really had no excuse for bad service. prices were decent for Vegas. probably won't go back unless i have to.",1
"I went here to buy some pan de sal and empanadas and they were horrible! The pan de sol tasted like it was made dayyyyyyys ago, not fresh at all. The empanadas looked like like they were going to taste good, but the crust was so hard! I had to break it off to get to a decent part I could actually chew, but after a few bites I spit it out. Yes, it was that bad. I will never go back here again.",1
"The service is terrible and the food is average. I'm not sure what people find so interesting about this average menu. The hostess had absolutely no clue what having a reservation means. If you make a reservation don't plan to be seated any time soon or be told when you might be seated. And the bar is small, so you will not be able to sit and have a cocktail before dinner. Terrible!",1
"The only jimmy johns I have ever been to that refused to let me order a ""side "" of peppers. Explaining to a high school teen how to wrap up the peppers with the sandwich, without putting it on the sandwich, was impossible. I love jimmy johns but I may go to other locations. The food was great, but customer service needs to go beyond just saying a ""hello "" at the door.",1
"I think Jet is very small compared to a lot of other clubs in Vegas. I came here for my birthday last year and it was alright. The bouncer I dealt with was a d bag. For being on a guestlist, I was disappointed to still have to pay 30. The music selection was okay but could have been better. I probably will eventually end up here another time and hopefully that time will be an improvement.",1
"One of the more inventive restaurants in Oakland, and yes, still affordable on a poor student er, shoestring budget. The satay chicken was tasty and flavorful, and the noodle dishes are all fantastic. I got the pad thai, and it was very tasty friends I went with got various curry noodle dishes, and all were wonderful.",2
"Only one here at first. 40min wait for one small pizza. Cashier coughs into hands and does not wash them after. Floor dirty. Had to wait 5 min to even be recognized. Cashier is now socializing with an older woman about ""personal "" issues. Very unprofessional. But the only reason they even got 2 stars is that their pizza is excellent. Just not the service.",1
"This is one of 4 locations I have frequented over the years. The one on Bell now being closed. I have always liked the food, mostly going for breakfast but with the occasional lunch tossed in. This trip around I got a Smokehouse grilled cheese sandwich which has ham, bacon, turkey, tomato, bbq sauce and some cheese. I was stuffed. The service was friendly as always.",2
"Service was beyond bad, we waited waited for refills, the check., will never come back. Food was overpriced, and the server spit when he spoke, so being literally spit on plus waiting when there were maybe 4 families in the whole place. Food was whatever.but could not get over how bad the service was. What a way to treat my Mom on her birthday total fail it took 2 hours to get out of there",1
"I'd give this place more stars if they didn't lack in hospitality. I mean could you just crack a smile? I mean even when I say thank you they can't even acknowledge the courtesy that is being passed to them. I'm a server myself and of Thai background, ladies.find a little zen in your life. Serving is a great job and I enjoy what I do. Great food though, just too many resting bitch face waitresses.",1
"Is it me or does the customer service suck? I've worked as a bank teller before and we always did what we could to expediate the lines and cater to the customers. This place seems like the opposite. I've waited on line for 15 minutes when there were three people in front of me. I'm sorry, but that is just ridiciulous.",1
"WOW! WOW! WOW! This show was just amazing! I was a little hesitant since I know they had to modify parts, due to the tragedy that happened a few months ago. I am so glad we went! I have seen two touring cirque shows Quidam and Corteo and we also saw Zumanity while in Vegas. This one went above and beyond. It took my breath away. The whole experience was great from start to finish.",2
"They make a good brandy old fashioned, but otherwise I am not a fan. Like a previous reviewer, I am also grossed out by tartar sauce that has been sitting out for who knows how long. And the fish fry? I really don't see any greatness there. Cave ish interior, average clientele age of 75 really not my scene.",1
"Placed an order on line. Very easy process. Went to the store, walked up to a checkout counter and asked the girl where merchandise pick up was located. Lucky us, it was right around the corner! Went to pick up area, entered my info into machine, and someone brought my merchandise out within 3 minutes! It couldn't have been easier!",2
"I've been here for a Sunday lunch and a weekday lunch. Sunday was pretty crowded and kind of loud, weekday was calm. I have ordered the Fish Taco and the Turkey Devonshire huge portions, worth the cost because you can get two meals out of it. Service was fine both times. but parking is tough, as is normal in Oakland. No parking lot.",2
"Second visit and always enjoy this restaurant and it's many tapa selections. Sit at the bar and be entertained by Jeffrey, one of the bartenders. He is one of the best around, upbeat and fun and full of suggestions. The tuna cones are my favorite, but everything is tasty and presented very well. Try the peach sangria!",2
"I have been taking my vehicles to Capitol Tire after a bad experience with another shop. I have purchased tires, had oil changes, and other service and I have never been displeased. If something isn't right, they will fix it immediately. They even have a nice shuttle service so it's not a hassle to drop the car off for the day. Great service! nI wouldn't take my car anywhere else!",2
"went to their lunch buffet because it was in the top then of a magazine, at first wasn't very impressed with their variaty, there wasn't a lot to choose from but decided for the meatloaf, which was realllllly nice and juicy and for desset went for the bread pudding that was said their number one, and can't dissagree, it was the best, really looking forward going back.",2
"I don't see what the hype is about. Let's just say I had an ""in "" to get in here with no line, no cover, bottle service and didn't pay a dime. And I would still not go back. I think xs lacks originality. However, on a positive note, music was good the place had a high energy. I think yelp's comment of ""Meh. I've experienced better. "" hits it right on the nose.",1
"This is the best place to get ANY kind of liquor, beer, wine, or accessories. It's definately the best selection in town, and has all of your alcoholic needs. The most important part is to bring cash because the cash price is MUCH cheaper, and if you don't pay cash, you will be paying the same amount as you would at any other place.",2
"Not the best mexican restaurant. The food was very bland and a little bit over priced for what it really was. I ordered pollo fundido which is pretty good, but they served it with slices of american cheese on top, which is not how pollo fundido is supposed to be served. I would not recommend this mexican restaurant if you are looking for authentic mexican food.",1
"I was surprised by the generous portions of lettuce with that came with my order of spring rolls. Attentive and quick service. Never had a problem flagging down one of the 4 servers on duty. An all around good experience. The first pho I've had in Vegas. While not the best broth I've ever tasted, it wasn't disappointing.",2
"I just wish there was a Luke's in Flagstaff! Try the Combo, beef and sausage, that requires a roll of paper towels to mop up the drippings. It is so good. And the Italian sub is bravo delicious! The place is tiny and crowded, but it's places like this where stuff of legend comes from. Amazing sandwiches. Have always encountered friendly staff with quick service.",2
"Was really excited to eat here after reading the menu but the comfort food didn't materialize. Had the meatloaf and it was unfortunately dry. Mac n Cheese was very run of the mill and didn't appear to be baked. The pulled pork egg roll app was good though. 50 for two drinks, app, entree and tip. Wish it was better than it was. Place could be great!",1
"The funniest part of this location is not the theater itself, but the clients. The way some parents let their daughters out of the house these days is a show all by itself, and I am pretty sure it is at least R Rated. Then again, many of the parents were not much better. Oh yeah, the movie theater is good. Harkins are never bad.",2
"OK, so this place is perfect for kids birthday parties or someone that's never been on a horse. Ill give them that. But for anyone that has ridden this was the most uneventful and boring trail ride to go on. There were so many people on our ride approx 20 .all we did was walk. no trotting, nothing, Just 2 hours of slow pace walking, even the horse I was on seemed bored out of his mind.",1
My aunt took me here! She bought a deal chicken or something I got a tostada good but nothing amazing she got green chilli chicken. All average but their tortillas so good! On point and delicious at home with butter. Place was really busy but I'm not sure if it was because the deal was expiring or if people really love this place. one star for being a bit on the dirty side!,2
"it doesn't pick me up from my door, but it saves me some gas and patience when I live my car at any park ride. It is sad to see that not even 1 year old and people is already destroying it some windows are scratched . Hopefully they can see the advantage of having this light rail and extend it's working hours.",2
I like to go here early in the morning because it is quiet. You can get what you need quickly without the drama of going to the big Wally World on Decatur. I only go to the big one if I absolutely cannot avoid it. They almost everything you would need so check it out! Plus it's right next to my gym so it's super coveinent!,2
I ALWAYS order the combination pan roast. I am NEVER disappointed. Be sure to go after the lunch dinner rush. There are like only 12 seats or so. You will be waiting for at least an hour If you're lucky I just found out they are open for 24 hours! Everyone I take here is as impressed my must go to spot whenever I go to Vegas. I think everything on the menu is fabulous. enjoy!,2
"Willing to give it another shot, but not impressed with the sushi. I like the vibe, small but trendy. Great drinks. Just was less than impressed with the roll and I had the soul special. nI admit, I'm a bit of a sushi snobb.but that doesn't mean I believe a good roll has to burn a hole in my pocket. No, I love the dive sushi joints that are actually good. Overall not impressed.",1
Had a great time here enjoyed some cold beers with my boys and enjoyed the good looking girls that were there that night it's a great place to watch the game if your ever in the area I recomened stopping by with you friends there prices are cheap and they have a great happy hour menu! Fireball shots always get ya going,2
"Ok after losing money at the casino time to find a cheap place to eat. Strip burger happy hour 4 7. Well, they were resurfacing their floor at te bar so sat in the outside section. 2 mini burgers. Fair n 2 french fries good, 3.50 beer was supposed to be 2. Service just ok. Got by with two mini burgers fries,beer around 10. Service just fair",1
"I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights. I was welcomed warmly at the front desk. I had a suite which had a second bedroom. The dining room, living room and main bedroom were very spacious. The hotel lobby is grand old style. The hotel is located only a few blocks from Grand Central which made it an easy walk from the train. The Grand Ballroom was exquisite and the service impeccable.",2
"This bar has been my home away from home for the past five years. Most times, the bar has a great sense of community, good music, best karaoke around, great kjs, good priced food and beer, renovations are always happening to make the bar a better place, I've met great friends here and adore the place. Most the bartenders are friendly and provide excellent service. ",2
"We really enjoyed this show but I made the mistake of cheaping out on the seats. I went by the rule that most seats are great at Cirque shows. It didn't apply for this show, the balcony left or right doesn't allow for full enjoyment of the show. The divers gymnasts and costumes were fantastic as usual although I recommend La Reve over ""O "".",2
"My husband and I stopped in for a quick bite before seeing O at the Bellagio. Pleasantly surprised by the food. We had shrimp, beef carpaccio, oysters and some sashimi. Everything was fresh and good. The waitress knew we were in a hurry and the food arrived quickly. I would go back for a more leisurely dinner.",2
"OK, here's the deal. Dropped my Samsung Galaxy S4 in the pool. Phone would not charge. Replaced the charging port. It did not fix the charging issue and I ended up messing up the antennae. Took it to Dan. Five minutes later, he had the antennae secured properly and working. Asked him how much. He said no charge. Dude is legit. I shall go nowhere else for my phone fixin' needs. Dan is da man.",2
"Received bad service today. Got the wrong chase for my sandwich, Got decaf tea instead of regular tea even though he was told black tea. Usually you have to ask for decaf. nHowever, lots of seats since the place was empty. We left Einstein's because it was crowded. nThey Missed an opportunity to impress a new customer. Guess it's back to Einstein's.",1
"Good looking talent and really good food specials will always bring the customers into this place. I will NOT return to this establishment again when in the area for business. nThe cocktail food service was the worst service in all of Phoenix. If management knew how much money that was not spent because of this lousy service, heads would most definitely roll.",1
I loved their services. It was easy to schedule my appointment online and they called me back later that day to confirm it. They showed up on time which I've had issues with other cleaning companies. They were respectful of my home and puppy and they did extra work and were happy and funny. I would definitely recommend Best Maid AZ.,2
"The seafood Pho was really good squid, shrimp, fish meatball, and imitation crab. Yum! I'd come back to try other pho varieties especially the chicken pho which looked really delicious. The banh mi was also very fresh and good, I'm told the best in town by my friends, this was my first. The place is a little hard to find but the service is good and the people are friendly.",2
"Illegal Jack's didn't float my boat. For quality, we found Tex Mex, on Thistle Street, incomparably better. And I didn't find it particularly cheap, either. My two courses plus a drink a very tasty Thistly Cross cider cost u00a320. You can eat lunch in many, many better places in Edinburgh for that money.",1
"Small ish bathroom loses a star, since I was traveling with kitty and the litterbox barely fit in.Comfy bed and a coffeemaker, refrigerator and iron were all appreciated. Speedy check in and out, and a good location, straight out Washington to the center of Madison. A tad cheaper than the EconoLodge down the road and by a tad, I mean less than 1 .",2
My friends told me about this place so I checked it out. They did not hv much to choose from for starter kits the staff was not helpful they didn't explain anything about there product were no help with liquids either. My friends explained more about the do's don't of the product the diff flavors then the employee's.,1
"Meh sums it up. nYou can hardly call this a mall, most of the casinos have more and better shopping, more restaurants and exciting things to see. nWe took a stoll, checked out all there was and were on our way. nYes, its nice, clean and new but there was nothing special about any of it. nSave yourself the blisters for a more exciting walk elsewhere.",1
"THIS PLACE IS small. REALLY REALLY small. Good thing theyr'e planning to build a new one. I got take out and drove 20 minutes back to work. Not Good. My stomach was growling at me loud enough I could focus oothing else. They gave me melted butter, hot sauce syrup with my chicken waffle. I'm so full right now. Fat Happy. Very very happy.",2
I went there this morning and was looking for a quick breakfast sandwich. They are supposed to be open at 6 30AM and I walked in around 7 15AM and no coffee brewed and I had to search to find a breakfast menu. Sandwich was okay but it took about 20 minutes to get a sandwich. I hope they get their act together or they arent going to make it very long.,1
"I'm really confused . I'm not sure why everyone thinks this place is so great. It wasn't a very memorable pizza in my opinion, but it did fill up my tummy after leaving Marquee. I guess the convenience is pretty cool, but at about 5 a slice and having to wait in line for days especially during the wee hours of the night I would much rather go to Earl of Sandwich.",1
"You can't live in Phoenix and not eat at Cibo! This is one of my favorite retaurants in the State. It's in an old house in a historic part of downtown, tucked away in an old nieighborhood, and the food is incredible. All of their sandwiches are perfectly done and flavorful and the service is always first class. Very easy to get in and out quickly, and with a full belly, during the lunch hour!",2
"This place was HUGE and not what I was expecting. The bird is rather random, but fits with the theme. The scrubs and lab coats were reasonably priced and there were as a HUGE selection. Overall, highly recommend this place. The parking lot is very very small though, so be prepared to walk if its busy.",2
"I loved everything I had. Schnitzel, Rosti, Tomato basil salad. My wife had the Swedish meatballs which were great and my daughter had the chicken with cardamom sauce and the green beans were garlicy and light. Every item was great. We shared a poutine which fantastic. We will eat the desserts later.",2
"The antipasto is fuckin delicious. It's sorta overrun with a more mature crowd which typically makes me a tad uncomfortable as a pretty pierced tattoed, swearing young lady. But the servers are almost always an absolute delight and the food definitely makes up for any weirdness with my fellow eaters. ",2
"Love this place! Karissa did my hair for my wedding and she did a fantastic job. I came back after my wedding and got my hair cut off. Again, she did a wonderful job. She gave me her honest opinion, and helped me make my hair awesome. And she charges reasonable prices for my hair. As long as I live in Vegas, she is who I will go see. ",2
"Fantastic hotel in ideal location in Montreal's Old Town. Lovely rooms, a perfect blend of old world charm and modern convenience, and spotlessly clean and fresh. Located a block from Notre Dame and the archaeology museum, also an easy walk to a ton of great restaurants on St. Paul and nearby streets. Perfect.",2
"I order from this place consistently and it is always hot, fast, and delicious. I am a picky Chinese food eater too. The portions are huge and you can substitute beef fried rice for your regular rice side! Great egg rolls which says a lot from the get go. If you can't make a good egg roll, well, you probably cant make good Chinese food.",2
"A calmer shopping scene than Forum Shops at Caesar or Fashion Show Mall and a good blend of couture boutiques to ready to wear, more accessible than Crystals and Wynn Encore Esplanade. The Venetian setting remains classic and a unique experience. Favorites include Chloe, DVF, Poleci, Barneys. Stop by Espressamente Illy for a delicious espresso or cappuccino.",2
"The food here is delicious! I had the bruschetta, chicken parmesan, and tiramisu, and would highly recommend all of them. I would rate this place five stars, but my server was not very friendly and they were out of the wine and dessert I wanted If the rating were based purely on the food, they would definitely have the full five stars! I will definitely be back.",2
Went here Last Month for a Bachelor Party Not impressed yes its the Worlds Largest Gentlemens Club But Quality over Quantity when It comes to Strip Clubs. A lot of Crappy Looking Girls with Crappy attitudes and it would not be so Bad if it wasn't so dam Expensive 1 Vodka Club 31 Dollars its OK I guess just don't think its worth the Price that's all. nMaybe next time I'll check out the Blue Rhino.,1
"Soooo yummy! I went on a Sunday for the seafood buffet. With HOT and Cold crab legs, how can you go wrong? The meat was perfect, sweet and not too salty. They also have oysters, clams, shrimp, sushi, etc. Plus, the gelato there is amazing. It would be worth it to go there alone for the gelato. The selection of desserts are awesome and the food is awesome. Best crab legs ever! Well worth the price.",2
"Nordstrom Rack is not your typical clothing shop. This is because this is the store where Nordstroms sends things that maybe aren't selling very well or are out of season. So don't come here expecting to find something particular. However they usually have clothing basics, and you can find awesome deals on designer duds if you get lucky. As far as shopping discount goes this place can't be beat!",2
"I called Precision because we were having some problems with our water softener. Our tech, James P. showed up early on Saturday which was great. He was unable to fix the problem but was able to show us a few things about the softener. I will be using Precision if we need any other repairs done in our house.",2
Long 4 hour wait and rude disrespectful miserable staff. People do not deserve to be treated like crap just because you hate your life and your job. I don't understand how the DMV has been around this long and still can't manage how to move things in the right direction on having a better system on how run things. Will never be going back here to this location again.,1
"Iron Grilled Sandwiches were good. Been here with some of my friends and noticed how lovely their burgers and sandwiches are. The dining area has good decors, ambiance was cool, comfortable to eat with. Employees were very helpful on our orders, I love how they treat us. It felt like were just eating at home. Will recommend their burgers and Sandwiches.",2
"I usually take my out of town guests here once and that's it. It is a rather large buffet and can be overwhelming with its 500 items ready everyday. I enjoy it when I go there simply because its a different food experience every time. Yes, some complain that its 52.99 pp but how many times do you come to Vegas or even attempt to even try to conquer this epic buffet.",2
"Not a place I will visit again. I work in very close proximity, had tried their coffee a couple of months ago and swore I would never buy a coffee there again I have not. On Thursday of this week I thought I would try lunch b c I always see the place filled during the lunch rush. All I ordered was a simple grilled cheese I was not even close to impressed. Never again.",1
"They didn't have the meat for the sandwich I ordered. So I ordered another sandwich, which was cheaper and they didn't refund me the difference. Both my mom's sandwich and mine was dry and the bread stale. Oh yeah, and I found many small bones in my sandwich as well. DO NOT RECOMMEND. WIll NEVER go back.",1
"This last visit was the 3rd time ever staying here. Like always It was a very good experience. Pleasant staff, nice pools, nice full size apts style rooms. Here's another thing about the place, I know it's Vegas and gaming is everywhere. But you don't have to walk long paths by slots, tables and bars back to your room. Sometimes that's a relief after a long Vegas nights.",2
"My least favorite cirque show so far. The visuals are great, but they spent to much money on the amazing set and not enough on recruiting the headliner acrobatic acts. Half the show felt like a mediocre Kung Fu exhibition. There were some highlights, but overall it was a disappointment. Go see O or another show. If you do go, sit back from the front a little so you can take it all in.",1
"This is my favorite bar that doesn't feature live music. The wait and bar staff are great and remember you after you've been there a few times. The average patron is professional but not pretentious, it's a down to earth crowd. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that they took the drunken salmon dish off the menu.",2
"I loved it! Totally raunchy and hilarious. The stunts and acrobats were pretty amazing, but watching them done 10 ft from your face gave it an incredible perspective. The humor will have you rolling on the floor. Don't sit in the front row unless you want to be a part of the show and made fun of. Hurry and see it, I heard it is gone at the end of the month!",2
Staff is completely rude! 2 2 times I been here! Only 3 people ahead of me waiting for a blood draw and they take almost an hr to get to me. The staff need to learn to be more nice and change their tone of their voice. Especially the lady with the boy hair cut. She could learn some manners. Being rude to everyone is very unprofessional. From now I will be going to a different location.,1
"Self serve frozen yogurt should take over the world. They swap out their machine flavours and have 1000s of possible combinations with their toppings. They even have cookies and crepes now. Perfect place for a first date or catching up with a friend, but watch the weight of your serving or you might get a nasty surprise.",2
Unfortunetly a fail. A cute restaurant on Saint Paul but the mood was mediocre if not bad. Me and my friend had a pretty good meatball appetizer but the duck and mushroom pasta was awful. Tasteless the mushrooms were gross and the duck was hard. The staff was delightful though and a big help when looking for a place for me and my girl friend to go to. Otherwise avoid this place if your a foody,1
"I don't want to share the details of my experience, because some people come to expect it. I will just say that the Manager, Ken Murray, and another employee went above and beyond anything that was expected to help me out of my situation after the shop was closed. Thank you so much. You have a customer for life.",2
"the only reason I'm leaving a review is because the young man who took my order and gave me my food is the most polite worker I've ever encountered at a little ceasars haha. This was last night around 1030. Kid deserves a raise. I don't typically eat pizza these days but someone else asked for it so I got it and was surprised by how great the service, speed and accuracy were. Great location.",2
"I enjoy the pizza here. My only complaint is the staff. Some of the RUDEST customer ""Service "" I have experienced in LV. The young lady that works the counter should be fired and replaced. Try and think of me as the guy THAT PAYS FOR YOUR DOORS TO STAY OPEN. Tuesday is 2 for 1 pizza but you have to ask for it. So don't forget.",2
"La bi u00e8re est pas ch u00e8re et locale, la musique est hard rock et les expo temporaires sont sympas, dommage que les videurs soient lourds u00e0 demander la carte d'identit u00e9 u00e0 des gens de 30 ans on se balade pas toujours avec son passeport sur sois! Y'a aussi des concerts u00e0 l' u00e9tage c'est pas mal, mais c' u00e9tait mieux avant.",1
UGHHHHHH! after we ate here we were immediately dying from all of the MSG used in the food.everything was WAY too salty. and its very hard to make congee taste bad but they did. my husband had the pho and a friend of ours had the pad thai.both of these were absolutely disgusting! Its a cute fast place but the food is absolutely disgusting.,1
"Good times with friends here on Friday night. I enjoyed the live music, and the dark pub like atmosphere. The patio was large but broiling hot get some misters guys . The bar itself is really nice and they have a huge selection of booze. Skilled bartenders and friendly service made for a terrible hangover.",2
"The store Is packed with small gifty things but don't rely on them for the basics, at least when it comes to bedding. I drove a long way to get to the store only to be disappointed. They didn't have bed skirts, cal king sizes,or euro size pillows, etc. The store being called ""Bed "" bath and beyond, didn't live up to its name.",1
Robin Andrews has been my massage therapist for several years now. I am a dental hygienist and have had many back and neck issues. Robin is very thorough and knowledgable in many forms of massage therapy. She is also an aesthetician and master hair designer. Robin just makes things better and I always look foreward to visiting her.,2
"Ordered jalepano cream sauce over linguine with tilapia. Was their special of the day. One of the worst dishes I've ever had. Staff is bad, food is below average, but the beer is decent. The outdoor patio is nice, but lacking character. The garlic fries are good. Overall, go here because there are few choices in the ""land of chain food "".",1
"Had exactly what I want and more. Great store, great customer service and GREAT selection. One of the bigger selections for the size of the store. nThey do have a great locatioext to the theater, as people do like to browse while waiting for the movie I HOPE this brings in more business, please nerds, buy while you wait!",2
"Amazing seafood. They have a bunch of different cuts of fresh fish out on display, which I personally love to see in a restaurant. The food is great and the atmosphere is great, although it can be a bit pricey. I only took one star off because service was slow, but I also went during peak dinner hours so that's excusable in my opinion.",2
"I went to this place just to try something new, we'll let me tell you the food is average and in my opinion bland, when I ask for hot sauce they almost fainted and god forbid that you ask for a refill on your water that puts them over the edge! nI will go back just to see if they can make it better. We'll see!",1
Pork tenderloin katsu curry is the best! Husband and I even like their katsu curry more than that of Curry House! Will come back again for sure! The katsu did take 15 mins to make but so worth the wait! The only drawback for a big party is that it has a max occupancy of 18 and u might have a difficulty in seating all of ur party during prime time.,2
Amazing customer service! Definitely coming back! Reasonable prices and discounts. I got a gel mani for 35 which isn't bad for me. Staff were really friendly and offered beverage while we waited. It's better to make an appointment rather than a walk in. They also do eyelash extensions and waxing which is cool.,2
"Stopped by on a Saturday and it was closed! Yelp stars they open at 10 AM and I left at 11 with nobody insight! Bummer is I had just downloaded their deal online! And just after two minutes of having purchased it, I'm not able to use it. Can't say much for a place that doesn't post their hours in their store and doesn't keep their hours reliably.",1
"We LOVE Malee's on Main. We go there every weekend. We got my parents addicted, too. My dad loves the Crab Rangoon. My husband likes the Crispy Basil Chicken and Exotic Fried Rice. I always get the Arizona Heatwave made vegan , but I also like the Cashew Chicken made vegetarian. They're incredibly accommodating. The mango sticky rice is WONDERFUL!",2
I am very price motivated when purchasing my firearms and compared and haggled prices at three different gun dealers. C3 Arms was able to give me the best price and service for my last two handgun purchases. I will again give them the opportunity to sell me another handgun after the craziness of price gouging for all guns and ammunition across the country ends.,2
"Great decor, cool vibe, but my first visit ended up with a poor macchiato. A little light on the foam and grounds yes grounds in the cup. I really wanted to like it since I had heard great things, but that's a pretty bad gaffe. I'm hoping I just caught them on a bad night so I might try them again when I'm in the area.",1
FIVE STARS! nThis place is the best! The staff is so awesome all the time! They know just how to put a smile on my face every time I am there. And the waxers are amazing! I don't know why people say you can't always get a good wax because you can here! You just have to be able to communicate what you want to your waxer! I will NEVER EVER go ANYWHERE else!,2
"Known for its pastrami sandwiches. I think this place is much better than Carnegie Delicatessen. Our server, Chompie's Deli was excellent. Service was excellent. I feel that the pastrami meat here is softer and more tender than Carnegie. If you are really hungry, you can finish one order. But if you are not that hungry, it is better to share. I would definitely go back again.",2
"I have tried to make an appointment at their brow bar now twice. The first time they were totally booked. Today I called made an appointment then drove straight there just to be turned away. They claimed they didn't have me down and rather than find a way to fit me in, they just took the sucks for you approach. I will not be coming back.",1
"One liner Overpriced small bowls of Asian food. Ordered the Pad Thai. The noodles were overly cooked and completely broken. It was a disaapointment at best. The other thing I had issue with was the price. Way too high for the small bowl of food I got for it. The woman at the counter was very nice and very cheerful. If not for her, this would have gotten a 1 star.",1
"I wasn't sure about staying here at first. I doesn't look that nice from the outside and I just imagined cheesy pirate stuff everywhere but luckily it was not like that at all. Everything is nice and modern, the rooms are not the biggest but they are still pretty nice and the breakfast buffet is one of my favorites.",2
I ubered or did I lyft.can't remember.a couple guys who are associated with four peaks kitchen manager? and another who is now at wilderness. If the rest of the staff are as personable and fun as these guys than this has got to be a winning place.besides Four Peaks mesa has always been top notch. nTam,2
"One of my favourite burger places I've visited, and I love me a good burger. The decor is nice and modern. They serve fries and sweet potato fries in a mini shopping cart, mixed if you want them. So yummy! The burger was great too. Nothing disappointing about this place. Quite impressive for a burger joint. I guess in America they take their burgers more seriously than in Canada.",2
"Would not recommend living here. The leasing process is quick and easy making the complex and all its amenities appealing however, that is not the case after living there. The staff changes regularly and is unreliable. Account balances were disorganized and lack of communication between tenants and the staff caused late payments. I would not recommend living here, it is over priced anyways.",1
"Totally a fan. Great food, much better than any other fast food chicken place. Healthy options. Caters to kids, no small task there! Love this place. Great coupon policy too, they take expired coupons and multiple ones. Buy their calender in Dec. it will save you a lot of money. BTW they use real whole chicken breast.",2
"Ended up here after being unable to find the place we were looking for, so already disappointed. I got a veggie wrap for 4.99 average, and a order of fries for 2.99. Fries were good, but a smaller serving that you would expect for 3. Nice flat screens along the walls. Basic bar food at slightly above average prices. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.",1
"I saw a Dunkin Donuts worker carrying a tray of donuts. When she tilted the tray and lost a donut, she picked it up and put it back on the tray and took it to serve to people in the casino. Not only nasty but potentially a definite health risk! Never touch a donut there again. I gave one star because the app would not allow zero.",1
"My wife and I checked this place out while on vacation and, simply put, had one of the most consistently delicious meals ever. There wasn't a bad note. The stir fry calamari appetizer, bone in rib eye, and chilean sea bass were all delicious. nSo excited to hear that there is also one in my home of Orlando. nYou cannot go wrong for an upscale romantic restaurant. It is mouth watering good.",2
"The service was not good here. For some reason, our waitress wouldn't take drink orders or bring out refills. I think there was another person in charge of drinks. I had some vermicelli noodles with beef, which tasted good. My friend had what they called pho with shredded chicken. and got sick later. I'm no Las Vegas expert but I now know this is not the place to go.",1
I hate coming to this urgent care but Because of my insurance and the proximity to my house its my default urgent care. There is no sense of urgency what's so ever here. Some of the medical assistants look like they jut rolled out of bed without showering or laundering their scrubs. The front desk can be very slow. Some of the dr's hate being there. If you have a choice go elsewhere.,1
"Dr. Groghan is awesome! I had just moved from Arizona and am very picky about where I take my animals, I was told this place was awesome by a friend and took my Kitten Oliver there for his booster shots. Paid way less than I expected, and the entire staff is just awesome. Safe to say I found a permanent vet!",2
"This casino is very good looking both on the outside with fire and fountains and on the inside with chandeliers and grand carpets. The movie theater is nice and clean. The bowling alley is also top notch, and I know they host professional bowling tournaments there as well. There's a food court as well as top notch restaurants for dining and an arcade for kids. The Red Rock is one of my favorites.",2
"The review is for the nightlife there. I love that you can take the monorail from hotel to hotel. Also, we went to the Cat House and my friend and I got in free and got free drinks till midnight. We went on a Wednesday for ""Wonderland Wednesdays "". Get your drinks from the male bartenders because the girls give very little!",2
"A lot of old reviews might say this place isn't good but I enjoyed the customer service. I took my car in with my Groupon believing I needed the brakes changed. After inspecting them I was told that the brakes were fine. I'm happy that they were honest with me instead of lying. Check out the Groupon available now, it's a great value for all they will do for your vehicle.",2
I don't know what it is about this place but man oh man do I have a good time. Give me a pumpkin beer in a cinnamon sugar rimmed pint glass SOLD!. This is definitly my new favorite Friday Saturday Night hang out the people are cool the bartenders rock and the atmosphere is just plain cozy. I'll be checking think place out more often and will be back to review the food ,2
"Buyer beware. This store only gives store credit for returns. Even within the seven day return period. They do not tell you this when you check out. A small sign stating their policy was pointed out to me when I returned the shoes. I understand they are a small business, but they should mention their return policy at the time of purchase or place the sigear the cash register.",1
"What a nice place this is. We had reservations and were sat at a window seat. Beautiful views! The prime rib was very generous, cooked to perfection, crab cakes were excellent and the baked potato was huge and came with everything. The service was great too! I usually don't go to any restaurant twice in this town because there are so many still to try however, I will be back to this one.",2
"The absolute best meal I have ever had, and I have been to the French Laundry, so that's saying a lot. You HAVE to get the lobster pot pie, simply unreal. The service was impeccable, the location is perfect, the decor and ambiance is perfect. I could heap superlatives on this place all day long. A definite must have while in Vegas.",2
We ended up here because everything else was closed on Superbowl Sunday and we were both pleasantly surprised. I've been wanting to try this place ever since I saw them on Check Please My husband and I each had the salmon with grilled veggies. It was delicious! For dessert we split the key lime tart which was decent. We will return for the fish.,2
"I used to frequent this location about 5 years ago and then the food quality seemed to take a dive. Recently, I decided to try it again as Landry's took it over, and it is much better again. They have a great bar where you can belly up, eat great food and enjoy a brew while watching a game. Good location. I recently tried the tri tip and the chicken pot pie and both were excellent!",2
"Alright place to go if you want to try some slightly overpriced chicken strips. I ordered the standard box combo and the food was made quickly. You definitely get your money's worth on the portion size . The chicken itself is nothing spectacular, I like the strips at Chick fil A a lot better. The sauce is unique and I'd definitely try it , though the sample they gave me was a bit watery.",1
"3 stars for the food, but I have to give it an extra star for the view of the strip! We sat right on the patio and had a wonderful view of the Bellagio and of the attractive and at times not so attractive people walking by the strip! The burgers here are good, but don't try the crepes very flavorless! I highly recommend ended your meal with a latte! It was the best latte I've ever had!",2
"Wow! I just had an awesome breakfast and I am ready for the rest of my day! I decided to try ""The Favorite "" breakfast plate because it had avocado, goat cheese sundried tomatoes my 3 favorite things . A very friendly girl brought the plate out to me so I didn't have to wait by the counter. The food was fresh, hot, and tasted great! I will definitely be back!",2
6 of us mostly had a very enjoyable meal one had an overly breaded deep fried fish which didn't sit well in celebration of a recent holiday. Smorgasbord of an appetizer is a great idea to maybe help you make up your mind as to what to get for dinner. Special mojitos from the bar were very worthwhile. Owners staff are very attentive and always seem to remember our names.,2
"First time there. Went for the 5 BBQ, Wings or Jambalaya, and the 1 or 2 grab beers, but since we were seated in the roomy, back Tiki bar section, ended up ordering off the menu. Loved the Southern Fish Tacos, and we still got the cheap beers. Not to mention the free American Honey shots! Great service from Duncan, too!",2
"If the service sucks then the quality of food and the price doesn't matter. That said the beer here is incredible and the food, IF it comes out right is pretty good. My service was horrid unfortunately. I tried this location for both breakfast and dinner while in town hoping it was a one off situation If I return ill just go to the bar for the beer which I wish I could get in my home state.",1
don't use this cleaning service! they are a total scam! I purchased through living social as well living social was fantastic refunded my money to my card! I advised them to check in to this deal ccel their association with these scammers! Wish I would have checked Yelp b4 purchasing . I will next time even though living social is usually good at vetting those they market.,1
"THIS HOTEL IS THE WORSE ONE IN L.V. DON'T GO THERE. nThe hotel is very old and low ceiling and there is construction and noise you can't go to sleep from the noise. In addition, no discounts for anything, they make you pay 5 to print your airplane boarding pass. The room's bathroom is very old, the sink is rusty and the bathtub's faucet is leaking and not working properly. Don't stay there",1
All the door staff is rude.they all obviously aren't good enough to work at other clubs so they hate their job. they are so unorganized. service was horrible they will sell your table at the same time you're buying another bottle.i wish this wasn't one of the only places to go on a Tuesday can't wait til they get bought out and close down!,1
I was so disappointed with this establishment. Song and dance on the phone then bait and switch when you got there. He wanted to be paid up front but didn't have a scale to weigh my clothes. Most of his machines were broken. Very seedy and undesirable place. Went to West Flamingo Fold and Fluff instead. THEY were gems!,1
"I've been here twice for concerts, and the venue is small enough that it seems there isn't a bad seat in the house as long as you're not sitting WAY up top . Sections L1 3 are good if you're not willing to pay for floor. If you're getting a drink, make it a double! Beats having to wait in a long line twice. That, or drink before. And after. Or all of the above. IT'S VEGAS! ",2
"All I can say is WOW, their buffet is amazing. They have a variety of desserts, including ice cream. The chicken fajitas were tasty. They had mini shrimp in some kind of sauce i ate like 3 dozen of those alone. The M sider was amazing. Unlimited drinks and beer was something new, most las vegas buffets don't offer that. I usually come here every month, because the buffet is that good.",2
"This is a beautiful theater. Just went and heard David Doubilet and Jennifer Hayes speak about underwater photography and there can't be a bad seat in the house! I could see and hear everything perfectly despite being in the upper left hand corner off to the side. Great talk, great theater and the people who work here are so nice and helpful. Two thumbs up!",2
"Great communication, very kind and respectful, got the job done well and came the same day. Didn't know we had to paid to pay for our own materials and the job ended up being 30 more than originally priced. That being said I would definitely call them again and trust them to take the time to do a good job",2
"My Fiance and I love going to Jojos. We love the atmosphere, it's always clean, the service is good and I really like that they don't act fake, they act like real people. And HOT DAMN THOSE WINGS. No one makes wings like Jojos! Pizza is also great, way better then those stupid trying to be fancy pizza places that are all over the place now a days. I always recommend Jojo's to my friends.",2
Maybe I was there at the wrong time. Maybe the cook had a bad night. Drove past this place so many times over the years and never stopped. The lack of flavor made me wish I had kept going. Had a 4 Philly w provolone and side of chili fries. It was all bland. Wish I could have had one of the great Philly's I read about in the other reviews but not so lucky.,1
"A must if you happen to be in Bally's and ieed of a quick bite that won't break the bank. 14 for a huge plate of beef or chickeachos with three tacos of your choice included, has got to be the best deal on the strip. Follow that up with 3 modelo drafts and the must have infused tequila shots and expect to leave full and hammered for under 50 total for two people.",2
"Excellent crepes and coffees drinks. nHoney butter sea salt crepe excellent ""original "" crepe if you like classics. nSavory crepes are delicious as well, fresh ingredients, perfect balance of flavors and of course, the perfect crepe you will get in Madison. nMust try. nOpens early, but does get busy once it hits 9 30 10 am on weekends. nGrab a seat by the windows to people watch too!",2
"I think the Curry flatbread is tastier than the Asian BBQ flatbread. Have not had an item that I did not like. Desserts are nothing to write home about, but great food, good coffee and great service here makes this a solid pick for lunch or dinner. Don't forget you can order online, and don't forget to pick up a punch card!",2
"Best Chinese food in the valley! They have the best food, the biggest selection and the greatest service. I don't think I have ever had to ask for a drink refill in all my times at their establishment. My family and I have a monthly tradition of visiting ESB and without regret! They are friendly, courteous and on point. We always leave a great tip, and for a reason.",2
"Whenever I'm visiting my parents in Phoenix, I like to stop by this place. I went there frequently from the moment they opened to the moment I moved to Tempe. I LOVE their tonkotsu ramen, and their gyoza is the best I've ever had! The staff is very friendly and welcoming. So pleased to have them in Happy Valley Towne Center!",2
I absolutely loved the 55 minute relaxation massage that I got from Analus today. She did a great job working out a few painful knots in my neck and shoulders. I left Elements feeling so much more relaxed and pain free. I will definitely be going back! I now plan to get my husband a gift certificate here for Father's Day next month. He'll love coming here too.,2
"In my mind, there is one reason to not instantly veto any trip to Pedro's the free fresh tortillas for the table. There's not really a reason to go to Pedro's, but I'm actually confident in my ability to find something edible on the menu now after a recent trip. I had a burrito uuuh.top right column that was reasonably decent surprisingly so, actually keeping in mind my rock bottom expectations.",1
"Not a good experience here at all. Do not use spa, no bathrooms, had to go to the family bathroom in my robe, inexperienced masseuse. Signed up for a trainer session and it was nothing but a sales pitch. Pool closed a lot, hair in showers and not clean. A complete joke, not a gym.more like a sleazy car dealership. I contacted management several times and no response!",1
"I've been meaning to review this place for a while. We stumbled upon this joint by accident and I'm so glad that we did! We haven't been here that the place wasn't bustling with people, even at 9 at night. They do a great job of getting you seated with tables tucked into every place possible. nEverything is fresh and full of flavor. We try something new each time and it has never disappointed.",2
"Excellent food, charming atmosphere, and great service. Love the rainbow roll and eel roll. Tempura cheesecake and green tea mochi ice cream are both delicious and unique dessert items. Bathrooms are classy and clean. Overall superb dining experience. Take out is excellent as well. Soy sauce, pickled ginger, and Wasabi are all chemical free. Be sure to ask for the fresh Wasabi! The best!",2
I went to Salon D' Shayn for waxing. It was my first Brazilian. Taylor was my aesthetician and she did a great job. She was able to answer all of my questions and even gave advice on how to take care of my sensitive skin going forward. I would highly recommend the salon and Taylor specifically. I already set my next appointment.,2
Will never ever step foot in this place again. The food was good but very overpriced. The snotty girl at the counter I was told She's the owners daughter was unbelievably rude. The employees standing outside were rude. Don't need that crap when there are such good places In the same parking lot. Like tavern grille. Great food and NICE people.,1
Over priced for steak. Ruths chris would be cheaper. Go for the west side oysters. Got the surf n turf. Yummy. The lobster was served outside shell. tater tots not worth it. Asparagus decent. Mac cheese came out as shells and no cheese. Onion strings were perfect. Others had the ribeye and loved it.,2
"Adam and My PC Clinic are truly amazing. My computer as running super SSSlLLOOOWWW. I tried all of the ""remedies "" I found online and nothing seemed to work. Being that my computer is only a few years old I did not want to purchase another one. Took in in and a few days later I my computer was back to what I remember it when it was new.",2
Great subs and a soda machine with every flavor. I wish the staff was more friendly. I've been here twice now and no one greets me or even says hi. Two people were just standing around while we waited for someone to take our order. We were the only ones in line. Love fire house and always round up. Pick it up east mesa!,1
"I came here with a group of co workers and we were blown away with the different selections. Everything from the sushi, calamari, filet mignon, and on were all fantastic. The portions were generous and we loved it. I can't recommend this restaurant enough. It has quickly become our go to place. The chef went out of his way to check on us and make sure we enjoyed our meal. Fantastic service!",2
Had a special occasion dinner here and was fully disappointed. I worked in the food industry for over 10 years and this place is terrible. The only good thing was the water at best! To top it all off 4 out of 6 of us got sick after eating the food. It is way over priced for such amateur service and boring food. Should of just gone next door to Zipps!,1
I luh dis place. I came here for the first time over Thanksgiving Break and it is probably my new go to sushi place when I'm visiting the Chandler Gilbert area. Pricing? Great! Sushi? Great! The uniqueness of the belt sets it apart from other Sushi restaurants as well and I honestly feel like it is faster than ordering off a card. All in all I am extremely excited to visit again.,2
"Really rude and inattentive staff. I swear the people working here are high or something which I normally don't mind, but don't do it at work. It's just annoying. Ordered a caramel flan frappe and it was the blandest frappe I've ever had. It's like drinking melted ice water that used to have something tasty in it. I can't even finish it.it's that bad. Avoid this Starbucks like the plague!",1
"Only 4 stars because 5 stars reserved for KA and O nThe beginning of the show, the crowd is entertained by a ""clown. "" It is mostly mild and harmless audience abuse, but it ifs fun to watch especially since it is happening to someone else. for those who haven't seen a Cirque show it combines mechanical magic, live music and spectacular ""circus "" acts.when in Vegas see a Cirque show.",2
We met these guys last weekend at the Downtown Phoenix market and they were delightful to talk to. The cookies are super cute and we found out so yummy. Everyone in our gang of friends bought one. I give rave reviews for the overachiever! Baked locally and even use Wei chocolate which is local and organic. So head down to Central and Filmore area Saturday and check these guys out!,2
"Live and learn. Live and learn. Average at best. Poor service, they pass off messiness and dirty as authentic. Sopapillas or however you spell it were delicious other than that it was bad service and below average flavors. Oh and did I mention messy and dirty? Thank god I was with good company when I ate there.",1
"They made mistakes on every part of our order and when we called, they denied it was their fault and would only bring the right food if we paid 20 minimum for an order. They are not reputable. Suggest you stay away. Side note, what they brought had no taste. Hope they go out of business it's embarassing to Montreal.",1
"Amazing. Finest ingredients and everything is made from scratch and cooked to perfection. There's no reason for me to describe the food because when I say perfect I mean it. You need to try it if you are in Madison, but good luck since the restaurant has very limited seating. Brunch food at it's very best.",2
Ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup on 2 7 14. How could you ruin that? The sandwich had 2 pieces of jagged hard plastic in it. The soup was terrible and thick. Campbell's would have been a better choice. And I paid 9.72 with 2 tip! nThe bar is awesome and the place was beautifully remodeled. Wish the food was there. 3rd and last time eating there .,1
"Cute little sandwich place in Old Montreal. The green pea soup was delicious the best I've ever had and my panini sandwich with pesto, mozzarella and tomato was very flavourful. You can get a 1 2 sandwich with soup for 8. Everything seems house made as well. The staff were very sweet and I got to practise my French.",2
"ahmazinggggg gourmet burgers, wow! You can smell the deliciousness even when you drive by! So many unique burger choices, or the option to create your own! Edemame wonderful. Little sausages delicious! Maui onion fries out of this world. Service was awesome, as everyone was friendly and smiling. I can tell this will be a favorite of ours!",2
"Drea, the bartender is the best, most attentive bartender I've ever had. I know this place gets a lot of negative reviews, but between the bartenders Shelby and Drea, I just don't understand why. They are such sweet ladies with wonderful hospitality. I have never had a bad experience here and I will never tell someone to not come here.",2
I have gone here several times. My favorite is their pasta. Tastes fresh and delicious. Pasta with clams is my favorite but I just tried their penne pasta and it was delish. The pizza's are great too.tonight we had Russo's special. The ingredients were fresh and the dough was wonderful. My husband is hard to please and he felt that their pizza did not taste 'commercial' but fresh.,2
"I went here to find out about wedding dress alterations. I wanted to find out more about Barbara and her prices, etc., before I committed to a tailor for my dress. She was rude and short with me and seemed offended that I might want to find out more about the person to which I was entrusting my wedding dress. I would not recommend.",1
Terrible. You seriously just served me cold fat drenched in generic BBQ sauce on a stale bun? Seriously thinking ownership just thought it would take a few fake yelp reviews and they would be rolling in the cash. There is a reason this place is ALWAYS empty. A drug money laundering operation is more believable than this place trying to be a legitimate BBQ joint.,1
"Hands down the ultimate Vegas show to see. There is X rated Humor throughout the show, but you won't stop laughing! The acts in between the Humor range from excitingly acrobatic, to sensually intriguing. A mix of Cirque de Sole acrobatics, Burlesque sensuality, and Vaudeville humor. Get ready for the funniest night of your life!",2
"For most customers, Swish is the place to go for cool retro satchels, sports bags, sweatshirts and college style tee shirts. For me however, it's the place to go for kick ass Ghetto Blaster bags. They don't play real tapes or CDs unfortunately but they look pretty old skool matched with box fresh Adidas and vintage graphic tees. Now, where did I put the awesome new M.I.A album?",2
The worst place to buy cigarettes do not shop here the owner is a nasty human being. They think they are doing you a favor by you shopping in its store. If you enjoy being treated like crap and yelled at than shop here because you get plenty of abuse here. And for some strange reason they always want you to pay in cash,1
"We had dinner there this evening around 530, Service was very poor and very slow. The food followed the service,Poor. I agree with Jeff K this place has struck out. Their prices aren't that reasonable, You pay PF Chang prices for a low grade Panda express sorry Panda Express We will not return to ta ta bistro.",1
"3 words for this magnificent show amazing , unique , beautiful, this show is worth every penny with out a doubt , a superb cast with amazing acrobatics this show will take you in to a dream, my favorite from all the cirque show with out a doubt . i do recommend pay for the seat with the hefty price since you will get a better view of the things happening in the water . will love to see it again",2
"I did not really expect a lot from this place. I was right, this place is nothing special. The hamburgers are OK but is not worth the price 8.95 for a regular hamburger . The fries were so so. They overcooked my burger. The butterscotch milk shake was good but you do not get your moneys worth. I do not think I will be back to this place.",1
"I'd come here for the fantastic view, you get to take in the sights of the entire strip from the Rio's 51st floor. I came here on a Monday and Tuesday night, both nights were really lame and they ended up closing up at 1. The staff is really friendly though and I would recommend this as a low key place to lounge, drink, and eat. Music was nothing to write home about, J LO? 'Nuff said",1
"I really want to eat at Parasol Down sometime but as for now I have only experienced Parasol Up. The bar is phenomenal. Great drinks dirty gin martini please! , good bar mix snacks, and good service. It's in a great location at the Wynn for people watching and you can also see the waterfall from there as well. Bar is definitely pricey basically 20 for a cocktail with tip, but it's worth it.",2
"The place was very nice. The food there had the good stuff. Seabass but taste wise wasn't that great , King Crab etc. Compare this place to the Bellagio's buffet, Bellagio was better. But the quality of food is better at the Winn's. I was surprise that there's not as many people here I had to wait in a huge line at the Bellagio.",2
"The whole trend of cupcakeries seems really bourgeois. It's about as awesome as buying a 4.50 cup of coffee. Anyway, the cupcakes are NOT that special. They seem dry, and the buttercream has that taste of being made with shortening, rather than butter. At 2.50 each, I'd honestly rather spend my money on a duncan hines mix and make 2 dozen at home.",1
This is the worst hotel on the Las Vegas Strip i have ever stayed at! The food at the buffet is just as bad. The rooms are cheaper then some of the others on the strip but they are terrible. My sister told me who cares is not like were going to stay in the room anyway were in Las Vegas and most people are out all night but at some point you do have to come back to get some sleep. Never Again!,1
"I was so glad that my cousin and his girlfriend introduced me to Butters! I had the Florentine Benny and a pancake. Despite the large portion, I finished it all with ease because the food was so good! In fact, I even had some of my cousin's girlfriend's Country Benny, and it was very rich and tasty! We went on a Saturday and the wait was quite long since they were super busy.",2
"This place has gone from a great place to hit golf balls to one of the worst. You cao longer hit any type of driver, fair way club 3,5 or 7 wood or any hybrid club. This goes for women too. Additionally if you want to use your own clubs, irons only, you can only hit from the bottom floor, which on a busy night is impossible to get an open bay. I guess it's back to Crackerjax's!",1
"The restaurant is styled after Spanish tapas bars, but with a diverse and creative menu with a Latin American influence. Cute interior, plus outside patio. Fairly small, not many tables, but there was also a bar area where it looked like you could eat at the bar. Food was quite good. The bruschetta plate was excellent. I would definitely repeat.",2
"I like this place alot, esp for their plethora of screens and movie selections. I will say, I went here on the Friday after Thanksgiving and they were far understaffed at both the ticket both and the concession stand. Plan better please people go the movies around Thanksgiving! Never had anything from the concessions so I can't comment.",2
"The drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous. It's as tedious as waiting at the DMV. I don't understand why Time Warner can't pick up the box, since it's required for someone to come to the house to install it. Or at least have a drop off box! Or here's another idea hire more than one employee in a waiting room of 50 people. Step it up Time Warner!",1
"The food is poor but it is a bar basically so I can deal with that. What I can't deal with is a sports bar that doesn't show sports on their tv's. One tv showed nothing, another group of them showed Commercials for acne medication. The also don't have NFL Sunday ticket!? What cheap excuse for a sports bar doesn't have Sunday ticket? In a football town. Never again.",1
"First off Half of the menu isn't available nThe Mexican cashier was really annoying asking where my parents were from, where was I staying at, where was I from, when I asked him to call a cab for me, he told me that he could take me to my hotel, I got really annoyed and walked out. nThird the food was below average, the fried plantains were the only good thing out of the three things I ordered.",1
Um yea. this is almost a little too over the top. The decor style is the finest of any Mexican restaurant I have ever seen. The food is so far from your typical Mexican fare that it is actually hard to describe. This is great for people who love Mexican food and can handle a little heat. Get the Jalape u00f1o shooters to get started!,2
"Do not use this company! They told me within one hour, then I called again they said the driver have 90 mins. 90 minutes later, they said the driver is in traffic and wait for 15 minutes, I checked google map no accident, all green on all freeway. 15 mins later called they said half an hour, then another half hour. I ended up calling another company and they came within 30 minutes.",1
Pretty disappointed with the food. The group I went with had a few huge Hooters fans so we definitely had to stop in for some wings. Unfortunately they were a huge let down compared to every other Hooters we have been too. Cold wings that were more expensive thaormal combined with a basically nonexistent waitress made it pretty unexciting,1
The overall experience was subpar. No greeting or direction on where to order when we entered. The burgers were cooked a little rarer than our tastes. The food in general was just average. Not much flavor. Smash Burger down the street is much better. And there's no need to make a comparison with 5 Guys. I don't see this place lasting long. The operation doesn't seem to be run smoothly either.,1
"Actually if I could this would be 0 stars. After 45 mins of waiting on appetizers, having to ask for a drink refill and then our food coming out before the app and being completely wrong, I walked out. I have never walked out on a table in my life. I served tables for 5 yrs myself. Very very very disappointed.",1
I noticed all of the reviews for this restaurant are dated. They have actually changed their name. It was nothing to do with poor service or food though. I think this is the best Thai food in Charlotte. I recommend anyone that likes Thai to check it out. We always have great service and the food is always excellent. nThe name is now Thai 1st. They are open for lunch now too.,2
"4.5 Stars. Casino is always busy and crowded, but the dealers are very friendly. Room was okay, not much better than other casinos on the strip. What you really pay for is the great service. Friendly and prompt. I docked half a star because beverage service needed some severe revamping. Waited almost 15 minutes for a waitress to come and waited another 15 for my drink.",2
"For a simple chain sandwich shop this business really shines. It's not gourmet, but the sandwich's are pretty good. Here's why I gave it four stars 1 they taste good, 2 the prices are reasonable, 3 the work area is clean, 4 the sandwich's are made fast and 5 the employees are personable. Give it a try.",2
"Be warned you're thinking take out but you get REALLY REALLY small portions for what you pay for. The food itself isn't bad, but they really skimp on portion size. It's really expensive for what you get! I've tried the dan daoodles and another dish. Again, it's not bad, just really small and really expensive.",1
"I went back with my family that was in town to Over Easy for breakfast. It was as great as it was the first time. The service and food were both excellent. I had the make your own omelet with smoked salmon, cheese, and peppers. There was the perfect amount of everything in it. I really enjoy this little breakfast place and my family did as well. I will definitely be back again.",2
"Went during Sunday brunch 3 30 14 the price was reasonable at 29.99 per person although alcohol was not included, had a lot of choices including crab legs, oysters Mediterranean food on top of the typical buffet food. Our waitress was super friendly, but the cashiers need to adjust ther attitudes. Overall food was good, just stay away from the sushi.",2
"Went inside thinking it would be faster! NOT n5 cars went through drive through and 7 orders inside 2 people left over 30 minutes waiting to place order glad you have good drive through business. nGet it together, you have 1 cashier she has to get the donuts plus run register. While 2nd cash register sits idle by. nWon't visit this place again.",1
"Tried Gordo's out for dinner. Went through drive thru. Took 20 mins to receive food. Ordered enchiladas, chicken chimi, nachos in cheese and a kids meal with taco. It cost 39! Was really surprised! You can eat at Serranos for cheaper and about as fast. Was really hoping for this experience to be different! Staff seemed over whelmed and not very friendly.",1
"One of my favorites in Madison. Went recently and got the grilled cheese and butternut squash soup. Both quite tasty. Would recommend either if you go. Service was prompt and friendly. The bartender was extra friendly. I got a mimosa and they gave me the tiny bottle as a sidecar! I was a little weary about going hear knowing how much I love the Owl next door, but this place was just as great!",2
This is the closest sushi to my house so I come here quite a bit. I mostly get takeout but have had AYCE and lunch specials a few times. I love that you can get half rolls. Food is fast and fresh. Service is on point. Prices are great. What more can you ask for? I have ordered sushi platters for a party and was very happy with them. This is a solid neighborhood spot.,2
"I loved the service here almost as much as the food, they were very polite and friendly. They did forget one item the second time we went, but they brought it out quickly enough and everything tastes so good that it's hard to think about complaining over something like that. It's a bit pricy but worth it if you are in the mood for a dim lit comfortable dinner out",2
"Enjoyed both meals I had here during recent visit to Vegas. Plenty of draught beer, PUB food with a twist, and awesome service! Highly recommend to those of you who love PUBs, but want something a bit more classy than your usual local dive. Of course you'll pay more.It's in Aria which is the newest hotel on the strip.But, if you can drain beers in 8 seconds then you get 'em for free!",2
"Love Bryant! No contract and no pressure. They came out after we saw our first scorpion in our house since we moved in 3 years ago. Price was reasonable, they arrived on time, and were very thorough. I was impressed by the guy and there was no odor which was a concern for me. We use them at my office every month and I would never use anyone else!",2
"This place is truly terrible, spent an hour waiting for my food, saw my server once. Food was brought to the wrong tables twice, baked potato tasted terrible. I would have paid to not eat there. Ruined my overall mood for the night, prime rib almost made me hurl. Avoid this place, I would give anywhere else in the casino a try, it couldn't possibly be worse.",1
"I was waiting for the text to pick up my antibiotics for three hours. Called twice and was left on hold until I hung up. When I showed up they weren't busy and the woman didn't even apologize. She said ""oh well "". I usually come here but there's an increase of ambivalent behavior of the staff. Which is a shame bc there are two Pharmacy techs there that are so great.",1
Target or Tar sh ay as it's known has always been a favorite go to place for me. I love their store brands that offer value quality over the major brand name products. This Target has been my home Target throughout my teenage years. In the Vegas valley we are fortunate to have great Target locations and thus particular one rivals most.,2
"Great neighborhood pub. Clean, well layed out, seating for families on one side, while the other side is dark comfy. Can usually score a groupon to help with the price. One of the best craft beer selections in town. Food's tasty, delicious mac cheese's, grilled cheese's, excellent pizza's. Service can be hit or miss, which knocks a star off.",2
" ""You get what you pay for "" duty room before we arrive n no fridge in the room n too much noisy even in late time n room still duty 3th day n smell awful, even ion smoking apartment n I really dont trust in their cleaning service, its disgusting to be here n It has being a awful experience good n free parking n free wifii",1
"I always have a soft spot for a good burger and this place delivers. Best Bloody Mary .well if I remember right.haha. nIt has been a while since visiting this Fav place for a local. But, I like choosing my own combo to make a perfect burger. nI have been there about 3 4 times and can be A bit crowded, but good indication the food is worth it. nCheers.get the Bloody Mary. 0P",2
Gross. I had a vegetarian burrito and to tell you the truth ive had better burritos at taco bell. I threw it away after 2 bites. Even the tortilla wasn't cooked all the way. My boyfriend had fish tacos and although edible we can make them better at home useing just the microwave. It was horrible and I won't ever be back.,1
"Gorgeous, CLEAN friendly salon! Everyone at Gelish Nails is very polite, helpful and does great work. I have had pedicures, gel manicures, acrylic nails waxing at this salon and have never been disappointed in the outcome. It does get busy, and you may have to wait if you don't have an appointment. I've been going here over a year and absolutely love it. Best salon best pricing in the area!",2
All You Can Eat Sushi? More like All you can bare to wait for because the service was so damn slow sushi! I swear we only got like 10 worth of sushi in the hour and a half we were there! We were able to watch Dances With Wolves and listen to November Rain in between each order we got! Boo on them! p.s. Was this really my 200th review? Damn. What a waste of a milestone.,1
I hate two lane drive thru. Unfortunately I live in the area. Three times now they go out of order and I get stuck waiting for someone to acknowledge my lane. Once they took two orders at the other lane while I sat waiting. Poor procedure inside. Each time no apologies and no offer to compensate even when I asked today. Go elsewhere like In N Out across the street.,1
Pretty good show shadowed by a horrible theatere show was really interesting in the beginning and end but had a slight lull in the middle. Daughter enjoyed it and she is 3 make sure you get discounted tickets and tell them to pound sand on box office fees. Make sure you get decent seats as many in the theatere had blocked views.,2
This post office is terrible. I have had 3 packages that were not delivered. When I call to investigate they are rude. They tell my that they will look into the matter and call me back and of course they do not. Moving soon and glad that I dont have to put up with these people anymore. There is def something shady going on at this location.,1
"It's so unfortunate that my first time yelping is because of the HORRIBLE experience I had. Everyone was in a bad mood, Rolling their eyes and making snarky comments. It's really upsetting because the food was amazing, but the customer service I received will insure that I never come back to this location.",1
My first experience with LaVida spa was just what I needed! Plus the new client n 39 special doesn't hurt either! My therapist forgot her name after being lulled into relaxation by her work made sure to make me comfortable and was great with judging pressure. They offer a monthly program I will probably need to sign up for as I'm ready to go back! ,2
"In from out of town and knew nothing of the restaurant. Was very impressed with both the food and the service. The server was attentive but not annoying. The owner greeted us and asked after our experience. The food was fresh, with excellent flavor. The sauces tasted freshly prepared, with obviously not canned garlic. Our only regret is there isn't one in our area.",2
"This is easily my favorite Sushi place they have a large assortment of authentic sushi and unique local favorites, and some of the best crab puffs I've ever tried. It's a small place, but it's never very crowded or over done in anyway. It's great for a casual lunch, or a nice dinner and sushi. I recommend this place for anyone looking for great sushi, and not some over the top franchise.",2
"Went in to complain. Wrote a 350 check. I dated the check November 5, 2014. Guess what? On October 30th they let that person cash the check! So I got an overdraft fee of 35! Ask them to drop the fee because I clearly dated the check. No surprise here, they refused to drop the fee. called customer service and even they refused! What crooks",1
"Went in for my lunch and Stefanie was the bartender. She was very fun and remembered me from my last visit, I thought that was great! Good suggestions and samples of new beers I wouldn't have tried on my own, and I was impressed with her knowledge of the beers themselves. My food came out quick and accurate. I left very satisfied.",2
"Horrible at least the GUMBO, the special of the night, Total fail, the rice was not cooked, the gumbo was so salty i fed it to the garbage disposal. Spent a total of 14 bucks for about 8 oz of salt water, and for a caramel cake that looked like was baked in an easy bake oven. I was very disappointed, rough looking people lurking, skip it and go to Farmer Boys. Sorry DOTS, total epic fail",1
"This place is fun! Huge space, lots to do. limited parking, but park down the street. I went there with a big group saw SuperTuesday great cover band, 1st time seeing them This place is pretty close to my place I can see myself going more often. There's something for everyone. And if you are a girl, you can always get to the bar just smile .",2
"This is not a real restaurant! They use a microwave and a toaster. Do not.I repeat do not eat here for breakfast. They use artificial eggs that are disgusting, stale bread to make toast a and day old potatoes and dry old bacon. Even the waitress agreed and took the food off of the bill. Go any where else to get food! Seriously!",1
"Just had one of the best pizzas I've ever had in my life. At least top ten. And I consider myself a pizza expert. It was made exactly as I ordered crispy and it was a modification of one of they're specialty pizzas. The ""heart stopper "" minus ham, add procuiito and fresh basil. Delish. Salad was great too. And great draft beer selection. Highly recommended.",1
"I had a bad experience here. If they say your system needs to be flushed, just get your oiled changed that's it! . Go to a place that guarantees work ie. certified mechanic, dealership . Lets just say their work, killed two of my families cars. Also they didn't carry the air filter I needed for my car. There was a lack in communication. Hey all of us have our bad days. ",1
"A total disappointment. My grandson and I were in Montreal for the f1 weekend. Prior to our trip we reaserched on yelp for recommendations. This resturant was highly rated, therefore, we decided to reserve for our first night. The food was covered with greasy sauce and it looked and tasted horrible. It was a waist of a dinner. The only good thing to eat their was the bread and butter.",1
"The Pad Thai is great and the portions are huge! The Tom Yom soup chock full of veggies and wonton soup meaty wontons, not all doughy like others taste amazing. nFifteen bucks gets a soup, 3 pieces of sushi, a crispy and tasteful imperial roll and a main dish, as well as tea or coffee. nHighly recommended if you live in the west and want Pad Thai.",2
"We almost didn't find this place and gave up, but I'm glad we didn't. I didn't know what Adobos were until this day and wow if I could I would eat it every day It was very very tasty and my mouth is watering thinking about it right now. If I'm in that area again, I will definitely try this place again.",2
"I can't understand how this place got so many good reviews, unless the people leaving the reviews have never been to Belgium or Switzerland! nService is very average not to say bad, the ladies weren't very nice I find. nWe tried pretty much everything and none of us was convinced about any item. It is expensive and not that great. I know I won't go back .",1
i'll make this short and sweet. best chips and hot sauce. They make them fresh to order. steak fajita tacos! The meat melts in your mouth. soft corn tortillas and peppers and onions! Hell yes! great place for some legit Mexican food! staff is always friendly too. which who cares with food this good! ,2
"We've been going here for 25 years and I had my first BAD meal recently. A rotten chicken tamale, the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten, either way it was stinky. The wait staff didn't seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before. I may go back here in another year, but Rosita's Place is off limits for me now.",1
"Excellent repas, u00e0 des prix tr u00e8s raisonnables pour la qualit u00e9 et l'originalit u00e9. Je vous conseille le foie gras po u00e9l u00e9, les escargots pleurotes magnifique , les raviolis aux artichauts. Il faut que je revienne pour les tartares et les desserts. A souligner une u00e9quipe au service tr u00e8s professionnelle agr u00e9able. Super adresse.",2
"I'm so spoiled having their HQ down the street from where I work. Their attitude is always phenomenal, their prices are unbelievable, and the sliders are AMAZING. They deserve every bit of the buzz they're getting. I would like to have a couple of their Caprese sliders as my final meal on my death bed.",2
"This was a great, family friendly activity. I enjoyed seeing the dolphins,white tigers, and other animals here. We got free tickets for attending something, so I can't comment on the price. nWe did enjoy it, though. I think it's one of those things where once you see it, you may not need to go again. It's no sea world, but it was something fun to do for people who are underage in Vegas.",2
"Waiter took his time coming by after we sat down, then only brought us the tasting menu because the full menu was ""too much to handle all at once "" Took us all of 30 seconds to read the five item tasting menu, then we sat around waiting for the server come back. 20 minutes later, we got up and walked out. Completely different experience from Aureole, where we ate the night before.",1
"Just wonderful! I came here for a girl's lunch and we had a great time. We ordered a bunch of different things, but the most exceptional was the classic curry. Perfectly seasoned, not too hot but plenty flavorful. Shrimp was good, hot pot was fun. We ate everything! If I'm looking for Thai, I'll be happy to return!",2
"We had the platter for two but in reality its a platter for 4. The best BBQ I've had in the States, the ribs were amazing and the brisket was super juicy and delicious. The service was good, our server Hunter gave us plenty of good recommendations on what to do around the local area. We will definitely be back!",2
This place was delicious! The staff is very friendly and the food is good. They are very very fast on service! Our food came out less than 5 min after ordering. Just make sure you bring cash. They do have an ATM on site but who really wants to pay a service charge. We will be back for sure to try the pies!,2
"So no rolls here, stop asking. This is a straight up really sushi, 8 tables and small sushi bar place. Owner called to confirm reservations, which was nice. Bottle water for everyone, great touch. Real,Real sushi you may turn Japanese after. I'm a fan and appreciate them not selling out to the average sushi roll typical place.",2
"Went to breakfast nothing special ordered waffle with strawberries and ice cream, a side of sausage and an apple fritter. Waitress forgot the ice cream, the side of sausage and the apple fritter! It's not as if the place was busy just a few tables occupied. Owner did apologize, however, but it's ""one and done "" for us at ADC. Too many other, better places to go to spend our money.",1
"Poster child for Americanized Thai food. Hey if that's your thing, then go for it. It's edible and fills your tummy. On the other hand, if you are actually looking for something authentic that'll make your taste buds sing. You'd better look somewhere else. There's really not a whole lot more to say. You've been forewarned.",1
"The most delish food in Madison. This is where you take a date if you really want to impress her him. The food is so good, but it can be a bit rich. Sometimes there is live music on the patio. The drinks are yum. It is not cheap here but it is well worth the price. Also nice is that Otto's is in a non convenient location making it more of a hidden gem then a trendy restaurant.",2
"This is a good location but a bit overpriced in every area including price of the room considering the quality, table limits food prices. The carpet in the hallways should be replaced or at least stretched I see a liability claim in the future if it isn't. It is a definite trip hazard. I was there for the NFR December 8 12, 2013.",1
"It's a cute place with a history. The lighting is dim which makes it a little stuffy. I came here for the hot fudge sundae, which was delicious, but it's also hard to go wrong with ice cream! I wouldn't come here again because the food doesn't seem spectacular, but if you're looking for a good sundae, definitely check it out!",2
"Best casual sushi in Vegas. All you can eat is a great deal make sure to leave a little room for the green tea mochi, which was the best I've ever had. Suggestions Starters Dynamite, Jalape u00f1o poppers, bacon scallop skewers Nigiri smoked salmon, yellowtail, albacore, snapper, everything else Rolls Sex Bomb, Jose, 911",2
"My pleasure! Something you NEVER hear, until you walk into this fast food chain. The employees are always in a good mood, and treat you with respect. The store is kept exceptionally clean, and the food is always made piping hot and is equally delicious well for fast food standards . This is definitely one of the best Chick Fil A's I've been to.",2
"Terribly designed! This is the worst designed eat and watch luxury theatre I have ever been too. The ledge is too high, so that if you recline your seat 25 of the movie is cut off! I had to sit on the edge of the seat and on my tippie toes to see subtitles. Experience ruined, and couldn't take advantage of all the nice stuff that they did put in there.",1
"This place gets 3 stars from me automatically just for the beer selection hmmm beer . The additional star is earned because the food is pretty damn good too. n Had the Charcuterie plate and a sliced pork loin sandwich on baguette, both exceded my expectations. Comfortable seating with many TV's to watch as well. Good new addition to the Venetian.",2
"This place is straight up disgusting. Don't go here. They sell expired, rotting and melting things. in their FREEZER. It smells bad and the place is just straight up grimey and dirty. Their shelves aren't even in order and most are empty and many randomly opened items. I feel bad for the fish cause their tanks are over crowded and look like they were pulled from the Hudson River.",1
"I have had over 10 surgeries as a former athlete. Three of them being back. I was told by my medical team, that yoga will hurt you even more. I was introduced to Sumit Yoga about 9 months ago. After my first practice, I was hooked. In four weeks my pain had significantly decreased. Don't always listen your Dr.'s. I love everyone at Sumits and they gave me my life back!",2
"Salsa, chips and water were great and got to the table fast. 20 minutes later they took our order. 40 min later we inquired about our food appetizers and one entree and the waiter forgot to put it in. We left. Great potential though patio was pleasant with a fire pit, guy singing Motown, grass nearby for the kids to play on. Guess we should wait for Omar to be working to attempt again.",1
"This review is for the Chips and Salsa I go to Cantina Laredo strictly for the chips, salsa, and guacamole so I can't review anything else on the menu. The table side guacamole gets a 10 10. I love the atmosphere and decor inside the restaurant. Very clean and friendly. They have a cute outdoor patio if you are looking for a nice spot to visit with friends. To go orders are always neatly packaged.",2
"So glad they opened a location in town. Il Pizzaiolo is as close to authentic Italian as I've experienced in Pgh. Had the lobster pasta special the other night and it was spectacular. Prosciutto and formaggi appetizer not bad either. Hard to get a table w o reservation, but my wife and I usually find seats at the upstairs bar when we go spur of the moment.",2
"Walked in and all three employees were in the back sitting on the food prep counters. Fries were not bad, but a little undercooked and the Louisiana rub had so much seasoning salt I could blow it off every wing and it was just over powering! The teriyaki and BBQ sauces were both good but all the wings were over cooked. I will not go back here. I'd rather pay a little more for Buffalo Wild Wings!",1
"The problem with restaurants like this is when you have tried authentic Vietnamese food and there is a huge disparity in taste and quality. Sorry, but after trying their food twice, we will never come back again. It's a short drive to Pholicious or Old Glendale's Little Saigon, so we will just keep going to those two.",1
"We came into Sprint tonight under unfortunate circumstances. My husband's phone gave up the ghost. We we're told it would be a 45 minute wait to see someone who could help us. Susan informed us of this, and that she was just about to leave but saw that we needed help. It was the end of her shift, and we appreciate her going above and beyond when she could've left work. Thanks Susan!",2
"This locale is within walking distance of my apartment complex. The lobby area is nice but I don't go in very much at all. The drive thru is quick and easy.friendly service.no hassle ATM'S and considering it is located on the corner of a major thorough fare it is very safe to conduct your outside transactions here. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!",2
"After tonight, f del taco! First of all, the workers were acting sketchy right off the bat. After buying my meal, i get half way through when i bite into a nice big piece of hair! So i call the location about 3 4 times, no voicemail available or anything, probably shaving someone's head for the next person who orders some food. I will never go to this place again",1
"went there three times because it's closer to my house and each time my eyebrows looked the same as when I walked in. The girls there don't know how to thread eyebrows. Drove to Eyebrows R Us on Marks street this last time, what a difference. Will travel to that location from now on. Totally worth it. I would give this locatioo star rating if that was an option",1
"so we went to the original one in PHOENIX! OMG! it was so great and 100 opposite of ahwatukee's! great service, great atmosphere, great FOOD oh and NO country music ! i ordered the carnitas DELISH the bf ordered some rib dish of some sort i dont really know because my face was eating and LOVING my own dish. i was MUCH happier here! GO!",2
"Omg! Why aren't you open longer?!?! I dream about Berry Blendz smoothies. So yummy. Love the omega fuel with granola on top. I use to work for JIU and we had the exact same thing, but there's no JIU in Vegas so I make my trip out to Berry Blendz from Henderson to satisfy my smoothie craving. For you health nut, try carrot apple with yogurt and bananas granola blended optional . So good!",2
"Excellent. We just went for the first time last week and found this place to be one of the best around. We do not understand the negative reviews. We found this place to be clean with very tasty food. It is not the cheapest, but the best asian food we have seen in awhile. If there were any problems they seem to be gone now. We liked it so much we are going back this week.",2
Thank you so much Ms. Diane for helping me out. You are SUPERB in your customer service skills. I recommend to all to go this location. I went to outlet north but so crowded. Here the staff are very accommodating and they have all the thing I want online. Same promotional discount as in their website. I will definitely stop by when I go to Vegas again. Thank you again Ms. Diane!,2
"I love this place! I enjoy the food, the beer, and the atmosphere immensely. What I don't enjoy? The service. The service is usually incredibly friendly but takes forever. And seriously, any place where getting up on the tables and dancing is encouraged, for both men and women, that is definitely the place for me!",2
we don't know why this place has such a great reputation. it's loaded with hipster douches and assholes with attitudes who all look like lumberjacks. boring. it's just not that cool. the oysters are good though. free appetizers for happy hour on sunday. that's pretty much the only time to go. there's also never any place to sit on a busy night. dumb. it's the shady's of tempe.,1
"Food is overpriced. Service is awful. They give you two tiny pieces of bread with a sizeable appetizer, but when you ask for more bread, they act like you're robbing them. They are all incredibly rude, including the chef. Terrible ambiance, no music. Trying to be New York. Waste of time, head to Herb Box, right around the corner.",1
"This place is amazing. As a NoDa resident, Jack's Beagles is the only food that I can consistently eat from the restaurants around here. The prices are very reasonable considering the great quality of the food! The pork tacos are ridiculous, all the macaronis are incredible, classic Mac being my favorite, the burgers are delicious, and my god is the widow maker amazing!",2
"This is a hidden gem in the East Valley! The food is so tasty and fresh, my son and I love it! Their jalape u00f1o poppers are amazing and the lunch specials can't be beat. The service is quick and delivered with a friendly greeting always. Try this restaurant and you will not be disappointed! Best sushi I've tried in Arizona!",2
Came here for lunch. I would NEVER go back. We felt completely like we were a nuisance to the one waitress working. Mind you we were the only ones in the restaurant. It took 15 minutes to get her attention that we were ready to order. The chips though free were stale and too thick. The burrito though large was doughy and the fillings were not high quality. Very disappointing experience.,1
"I really dont understand how people like this place. I didnt like it the first time i went, but my friends really wanted to check this place out, so i went again. and ARGH i just dont get it! Music house nCrowd short uglies nDrink super pricey The only good thing was that we got in for free. but other than that, yuck yuck yuckity yuck",1
"This place is very comfy, laid back vibe, serving only bottled beer and a full bar. The food is not bad. It's not very authentic, but your typical Mexican food. This place is really busy at night and it's a big hang out spot. I don't go here much, but never remember ever being disappointed in service or food.",2
"These guys are the best. They know the products inside and out, and are kind, informative, and fair in everyway. Take the guess work out of your repair, and let them do what they do best. I have had many Mercedes, and do know them well, but these guys have so much experience, and knowledge, and I could not recommend a more trustworthy source then the great people at MB Motors. nYou guys Rock!",2
"PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS! We had an issue with a small electrical component to our van. They tried to charge us over 2,000.00 for a new transmission. We decided to get a second opinion and a very nice mechanic fixed out car for under 200.00. RIP OFF ARTISTS at sun valley. DO NOT GO HERE!",1
Chef Marc.need to be at the Centennial location.10 customers walked out. My pizza was black on the bottom and burned on top. You had one pizza guy and 2 other ladies working the counter. I returned my pizza they remade it for me but it was as good as I had it 4 months ago. Very disappointing. Get some more help.,1
"This place is amazing. Every time we go to Vegas, we make sure to hit this place up at least once for breakfast. There is a huge selection of specialty pancakes, my favorite is the red velvet with the cream cheese frosting. I give their omelets a B , they are big and they don't skimp on the fillings. If you are in Vegas, do yourself a huge favor and check it out. The wait is well worth it.",2
"Wow! Just like its twin in Reno, the Peppermill's Fireside Lounge in Las Vegas is Heaven on Earth! WOW! What AMAZING, ""old school "" customer service! Two thumbs WAY up to James, Marilena, Alyce, Brigitte, Ruthie and Diana! You guys treated us like we were whales! Please Mr. Peppermill Give them all a big, fat raise! They more than deserve it! Oh and by the way, we'll be back!",2
"We waited too long for our food. The burger was preformed probably from costco and frozen , the french fries were raw. I ordered beer and they ran out,the next draft beer was stale. Our pizza was under cooked and greasy. 3 rd time I tried this place and it sucked all three times This place sucks. Don't eat here.",1
"Simply put, my favorite place to eat breakfast in Charlotte. I always get the same thing, and that's the High Flyer. The eggs are perfectly cooked each time, and the oatmeal pancake with peaches and syrup? Yes. My wife loves their grits, and we of course both enjoy the high rise biscuits I, with copious amounts of the apple cranberry butter . Recommended for a great breakfast spot.",2
"This place has amazing breakfast food and great service. Very easy going atmosphere. I used to hit this place up every morning before work. If the fresh squeezed OJ machine is working then definitely get a glass. But alas I don't work too close to this place anymore. Luckily, a met a friend for lunch there and it reminded me of the breakfast.",2
"Came here for the first time to meet a friend and I must say, it was probably one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time! The food was amazing and the change the menu every so often so you have to go back and try every. Prices were very reasonable, and the staff were extremely polite! Will definitely be returning here soon!",2
They did a good job on my pedicure but me and my sister both got a manicure and hers was sloppy while mine was crooked on a few fingers. It cost me a fortune and took forever. Everyone was nice there but to me it just wasn't worth it to spend my hard earned money on crooked nails. To boot they had a sign out front saying 25 for a full set but then charged me and my sister 35 45 each.,1
"We went here with our family and the server was very rude. He tried persisting we need to order more dishes. When we said no he said I don't care, just order. With service like that we got up and left without giving them any business. Go to another Korean restaurant on Spring Mt Rd. There are too many to choose from! Avoid this place! The servers are punks!",1
"Went back this Friday night to try different items on the menu. Each dish was amazing! Wine, Salad, Soup Caldo Verde, Grilled Calamari, Chicken Wings, Chicken Trinchado, Shrimp Skewers, Lamb Shank and desert Tiramisu. Very reasonable for a gourmet meal. Loved it! Looking forward to coming back to try lunch and open for the holidays with friends and family.",2
"The food was fine, but the service was a joke. When you pay 15 for a burger, you shouldn't have to pay extra to change the kind of cheese on it. And.when you have to order your fries a la carte for 4.you shouldn't have to pay for extra ketchup. As we were leaving I had to ask whether I would be charged extra for a box to take the rest of my burger to go.",1
"Been here number of times. Have always had good food. nYes it is pricey. And well aware of it! nLast visit, we asked just for a glass of their house Cab. n 28.00 later, for a house glass. And no one informed us. nVery sneaky ! nWe felt very violated. nWhen brought up to Bartender.yes this is our house. It was Brunello!",1
Thank you for accommodating my vegaeeds. nHands down the best veggie sushi roles in Central Phoenix! nI love the staff and the atmosphere here. I have been eating here for the last 5 year and always recommend the Cherry Blossom to my friends! nKeep up the good work! n Great Sushi Happy Hour and miso soup ,2
"Aira is amazing. Such a complete, wonderful experience. They have thought of everything, and you will be totally comfortable. There is endless fun things to do, and an amazing social atmosphere across all of the gaming and dining options. You must at least visit Aria while you're in Vegas, it's stunning.",2
"I have out of town guests coming this weekend so I scheduled Kleen Geeks a month in advance. I even reminded them of the appointment last week. They assured me they would be there. Wheo one showed up, I started calling 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours past their appointment time. Not only did they not show up, but no one answered the phone or returned their voicemails. I am really, really disappointed.",1
"Not sure how this place has 4 stars. I've had a salad,cheese steak and the pizza. I recently relocated here from NY and have been trying the Italian places out around town. I visited on 2 separate occasions and the second was simply due to a group decision. Mehhh. . if you have too I guess, but if you're looking for good Italian seek else where.",1
"One of the biggest disappointments of my 40th birthday weekend in Vegas. Yes, the patio and fountain show are great and fun. But it's soo expensive to have mediocre food and terrible service. Not only was the wait staff terrible, but the hostess was annoying and full of herself. Hey, I didn't make her become a hostess!? Wouldn't recommend and I'm shocked to read the positive reviews!",1
"Wow. What amazing service! The tailor handed me the suit my son was going to get married in and told me she doesn't clean or press clothes. These folks stepped in and bailed him out. The pressed the suit on the spot and cleaned off the the debris from the tailor lint, dog hair, bits of cloth . Just terrific service.",2
"I bought the groupon for my set of gels mani pedi, it was 40 collectively! Everything was done in a timely manner. Cute and smaller salon! Make sure to make an appointment. Also make sure to leave a message if your call isn't answered. My nail artist did not do acrylics but did a great job on my gels! I got exactly what I wanted!",2
"Jake L and Dana George do their best to ignore you when problems happen. nWhen your hotel doors are broke. When you get robbed. Jake and Dana are, in addition to poor managers, poor liars. I have yet to have a single call returned. nA single email answered. Yelp correspondence has been my ONLY correspondence nwith Jake L and Dana George. This hotel is shady.",1
"Ordered the Szechuan chicken and Hot and Sour soup both were delicious. The Szechuan chicken had plenty of white meat chicken. I only wish the vegetables had been sliced smaller and the dish was slightly less sweet, but I still thought it was good. The soup was full of shredded pork and veggies. Can't wait to try more from the menu.",2
"The room itself is decent and was a last minute stay due to how late our flight got in. The hotel clerk was helpful in providing some food delivery options for us. The continental breakfast that was pretty good. It had way more options that just a danish and coffee.Another benefit, FREE WI FI! Not a bad place to stay if around the airport.",2
"ahahahah man This show as funny as fuck! it was fun for what you pay for it was worth it you get to see your white tigers, this dude does some old school tricks that are fun to watch! and pretty girls on stage, get yourself 5 shots of tequila and buy a ticket and expect a good time! your not paying 100 bucks for this so don't expect sigried and roy but for 25 bucks it's worth the show .enjoy",2
"Service is horrible. Sushi chefs are slow. Takes them 10 min just to make 1 roll! There was only 3 tables occupied and the waitress says ""sorry for the wait, we got busy all of a sudden "". 3 tables is busy for a Friday night? Sushi was okay but nigiri had a lot of rice. Looking for a sushi spot? Don't go here.",1
"i live close and have been there under both mng. i think is the same anyway i ate here in the 10 th of May i was not gone 10minutes when after eating i got terribly sick horrible diahrea. now its not me IT WAS THAT OLD BAD FOOD amised with fresh. i never get sick , i shoulda went to the hospital to put this on record. never AGAIN dont care i f its frtee not wirth getting sick !",1
"Almost no chicken in my Kung Pow Chicken. I wish I could attach a photo to show the whole serving plate is still full after eating all of the chicken. Special fried rice is good but, again, tiny shrimp meat pieces. Would be good if they stopped trying to save money increase profits by skimping on meat in their dishes.",1
I don't know why my review is funny? It's the truth! They are in a African American community and they are not targeting the right people. Tell how is that funny please. Did I miss the inside joke of something. nThey are in East Liberty not Shadyside! They did miss there chance to move to walnut street and that's a fact. So how am I funny? The truth hurts does it.,1
This place is outrageously priced. I went on a date there at about 6pm this past Saturday. We bowled 2 games.the total was almost 40. This is unacceptable prices for a bowling alley. I also ordered 1 beer and that was almost 8. No wonder there was only like 4 people in the entire alley. I will not be returning.,1
This is the dive you are looking for! Friendly folks good prices Bar Food love the wings and BONUS free popcorn! nThe staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fu nI play Trivia there on Wednesday and it's a HOOT! good natured rivalry and lot's of interaction. weekends are great for playing pool and watching games on the plethora of big screen tvs. Nice big back porch for smoking and hanging out!,2
"I LOVE cornish pasty! The ambience is really neat but the place itself is a little small. Everytime I go, I try a new pasty and every one I have tried, I have liked. Good selection of beers import and domestic . I personally like sitting up at the bar because staff is really friendly and chatty if you want them to be . If you're looking for a new place to try that's casual, this place is great!",2
"Burgers, burgers burgers. This was the best hamburger I've had in years. I've had most every burger on the NYC best 100 hamburger over 3 years and can say that this would rank at the top. I'm glad Fatheads was too busy because now I know where to go for the best burger in Pittsburgh. Try it you won't regret it.",2
What an AMAZING place to have a quality fine dining steakhouse experience! This restaurant is one of my all time favorites and a requirement for my travels to Las Vegas. Only downfall is they don't have a location in Souther California! Occasionally you might see some Las Vegas elite and celebs dining next to you. Just don't disturb them they need their privacy too!,2
In Phoenix on business and needed a pick me up. Found this place on yelp and so glad I did! I am a massage addict so listen to me! nThe atmosphere was very relaxing. nThe lady that did my massage was very strong and she wasn't on her her phone. yay! Finally. nI will go back for sure the next time I am in Phoenix.,2
"It's been about a year since we have been here, boy has it and it's going to change! Service was much better, a lot more customers, and they are going to move at a new location. No more outside in the patio. Everything is going to be inside now! Hopefully this move is going to make this place even better?",2
"Seems to be the local place to hang out, the place was packed. Large selection of food, I ordered a Salami and sausage pizza, although it was good its just not as good as the pizza inside the Caesars forum shops. I wish we had got her name but our server was outstanding and was working her but off, I will return here again soon",2
"Picked up a friend at the airport. The signs were confusing and downright contradictory in some cases, and we got routed to the international terminal instead of the domestic one. Im sure my experience on the inside of the airport will be better next time, but they need to fix the signs so Im not driving around like a idiot. Also, Im an idiot.",1
"unbelievable ! i wish if i could give more than five stars. my car came out just like auto show looking car. love it! amazing job and excellent customer service. I feel so lucky,I had a couple of times bad experience from other body shops. i'd like to thank you to wesley and all the staff, you guys are the best!",2
I am disappointed to write this review. This is my fifth time here and after nThis experience I feel that burGr has lost it's luster. We ordered the jalepeno poppers and they were cold inside. The waitress didn't come around to even complain about it to. The burger was eh. Not bad not good. Fries were horrible. Onion rings were delicious though.,1
You know this place is getting more Americanized all the time. After living in the UK it was a fresh respite from the droll drum grocery stores here. They are carrying more US brand foods but keep that UK flavor. As a real nice addition the bakery is a welcome taste. This store is a welcomed addition to our neighborhood.,2
"Well.no worries for the continued bad service.awful prices.average inventory.and just overall bad experience.because the store closes forever this weekend. I have never cared for the place.so I definitely won't miss it. However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 60 80 off.then this is your weekend to go. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends",1
"Okay well I went in on Thursday night around 7pm the line was kinda long but i waited it out, nI was i n line for a 1 hour and 20min. when i finally went into the buffet it was around 8 25 pm then I notice there was about 30 tables were empty and clean. Just dont understand why i waited so long to get in. Well never return",1
"The team at this location is always professional, courteous and on top of my orders. I order large quantities for work and have never received the wrong order, a messed up order or had any challenges. They are always accommodating of any special requests and pick up times. This is the place to feed the masses at great prices.",2
"Spent the day at Acacia Day use area midweek in June. There was hardly anyone there! We were able to spread out and enjoy Canyon Lake. There was plenty of shade, it is maintained well, clean, restroom facilities nearby. We had a GREAT time! Don't forget to pick up your Tonto Pass 6 before heading up the skinny two lane road! I suggest the Circle K in town. Don't forget to bring plenty of water!",2
"Two notes n Returned from vacation paying too much to sleep on cabin mattress P So glad to get home and enjoy a fully satisfying, deep sleep. Mattress protector works! nAccidentally knocked over liquids onto the bed, which sat over night. In the morning, noticed, removed carefully, and thankfully noticed the mattress was not wet nMattress protector machine washed, Medium Tumble Dry nWHew.",2
"Fuego is a good time Tex Mex street food place. Don't go if you are expecting authentic Sonoran Mexican food. Interesting cocktail menu, along with a good arrangement of beer. Definitely try the Chile Relleno stuffed with chorizo and covered in panko breadcrumbs. The blackened tilapia could be the best I've ever had. Good stuff!",2
"I have to agree with L.K. review below this . Dr. Taffet was a nice guy, but I'm sorry when I get a bill for 450.00 in the mail for a getting my sinus' scoped literally the scope took 5 10 seconds I was in tears on the phone confused and frustrated! BEWARE if you go to this office If they scope you, you're paying ",1
"The service has improved, the patio is excellent with 6 tvs and 20 oz big beers for 3.99. The nachos and burgers are huge and great. The wings were excellent. You can have regular fries or duck fat fries with homemade dipping sauces. You can sit in a booth with your own tv for sporting events or ntn trivia.",2
"its okay.not good not bad. I order a number 11, rare steak pho.the bowl is very small and the meat quality is below average. I will not be coming back. I paid 7.51 for a bowl of rare steak pho that was very small. The restaurant is not very clean. Alot of fobs eat here. No then wrong with that. But being clean is a question mark here.",1
"Tasty enchiladas, great salsa and flavorful beans but it ended up being a bit pricey for Mex fast food. I ordered the 2 enchilada combo plate listed at 5.85, then added a soft drink and the bill ended up costing 9.50. Looking at the receipt I see they charged 1.00 extra for having chicken didn't see that listed on the menu and the cashier didn't tell me about it which was a bit of a surprise.",1
"I was really looking forward to eating here based on all the reviews. But my husband and I were really disapointed. The food was just okay. The oft raved about dumplings were so greasy we could hardly eat them. We tried a wide variety of food, but nothing really wowed us. n I forgot to add that while we were sitting there a cockroach ran across the floor. O.o",1
"I went in specifically for some birthday Mylar balloons that were all displayed on a wall. They had a nice display with many options! nEach balloon has a number next to it so I wrote down 8 numbers of different cute ""happy birthday "" balloons. nThey only had ONE in stock. Horrible. The only saving grace was the girl helping me kept apologizing. nSeriously though, order some stock!",1
"I am glad that they offer 35 reflexology, 60 minutes long. The session includes, herbal foot soak, neck, face, shoulder, back, arms, legs, and feet massage. Renewed! They often have specials, 30 for 60 minutes longs. I always check their specials on www.facebook.com AzulDaySpa. I used to go to California for this deal.",2
"Mmmmm! Ran across this little place and decided to stop in with the bestie for a some veggies and noodles! I'm a big fan of cute little whole in the wall places so this was right up my alley . It was so good we decided to go twice in a period of 3 days! If we lived in Scottsdale, that would totally be the spot! Enjoy!",2
"Hookahs are the draw here. The food is mediocre and the atmosphere quite blah. If smoking sheesha is your thing, there aren't many old town Scottsdale options so this may be your place. My bud ordered lamb tongue and was pretty happy with it. I didn't have the balls to try it, but if you do you may be in for a pleasant adventure.",1
"I was not impressed with the service or quality of food. It seemed to take forever to take our order after submitting drink order. In addition, the seafood platter ordered did not have any seasoning on the catfish. Could not enjoy. One good thing was the cocktail drinks ordered were delicious. Try the Cherry Spicy Rita and Lucille's Peach drink.",1
"Went there for lunch. Service was quick and friendly but the food was below par. Teriyaki chicken was ok, but quite salty. As a matter of fact, everything was a bit too salty for my tastes. Even the salad. For the location and quality of the food, I would consider it quite expensive and not worth it. 14.99 for a lunch entree and a drink is pretty high for this part of town.",1
"Great place for salads and sandwiches and the generally ""healthy "" feel. I've had all the salads and a couple of the sandwiches. the only complaint I had was there were WAY too many chipotles in the Arizona Salad and it way overdid the taste of the salad which was very good, btw . but other than that, the place is an excellent ""green "" place.",2
"Best sushi for the price I have had in Vegas. My friend and I shared the sushi sashimi combo for two and it was more than enough food for both of us at the price of 24! The fish is super fresh, and the service was great. I wish the place was bigger though because I know it's going to get popular and I don't want to have to wait in line.",2
"We ended up here because our usual Golden Budda was closed for an event but I think we'll be back soon. We ordered the meatballs which were awesome, eggplant with garlic sauce and 3 flavor chicken which were great, the wonton with green veg soup which was tasty although the green veg was more like seaweed and pork chow main which was standard. nWe had good service and enjoyed our selves!",2
"I have never been treated so rudely, by a fellow group of native americans. Makes me regret the time and effort I spent trying to help these greedy tribes gain this power, that they now so blatantly abuse. It also makes me rethink the whole legality of it. These apples have red skin, but a white core.",1
"Like Johnny said.5 stars for hosting UFC 84.possibly one of the best fight cards of 2008.Affliction Banned may give it a run. Anyway, the seating is good.the Grand Garden Arena is huge.but the bathroom lines were never horrible.plenty of concessions. The place was clean. Overall a great place to host such an event. G",2
"Da Bomb great food good service. The host was awesome. Never got his name but a big shot out to that guy. He did everything he could to make everyone feel comfortable at this small cafe. For those that get ""irritated "" at small cafe miscues maybe this isn't for you and that's cool, just more great food and less of a wait for me!",2
"Made it on my top ten worst burger. nOxtail chili cheese fries are overrated. Dry meat, couldn't taste any of the ingredients on the burger cause over powered by the sauce. nBun was a stale sweet roll. nNot to mention, everything was slightly sweet, which gets really boring for the palate. They do cook an egg well. Will not be back. Feel gross and ripped off.",1
"Poor quality food, always dry and unpleasant. A lot of employees enjoy talking trash about their employer in front of customers. Sandwiches made incorrectly often. Would not recommend. The owner has resorted to writing poor reviews for her competitors businesses, now reducing their business rating down to 1 star, in my opinion. Extremely childish.",1
"BWW has by far the best boneless wings ever. I hate wings most of the time because of fighting your way into bones. I actually never really liked them until I tried BWW. The sports scene is great because you have multiple games going on from different sports. We went on Boneless wings Thursdays where I think each wing is 69 cents. What a wonderful number, eh?",2
This is by far the worst rental company I've had to deal with. The staff are horrible. Their customer service skills are worse than mcdonalds employees. Maintenance is required monthly. Takes about a week or so before they even show up to do the maintenance. A C goes out during the summer at least once a week. Hot water was shut off for days at a time. I could go on.,1
"Carrot Top puts on an awesome show. He really seems to feed on the audience, and care about really entertaining people. He is not nearly as raunchy and crude as a lot of the stuff on the Vegas strip, but if you are offended by seeing a dildo used a a prop for comedic effect this is not the show for you.",2
"I can't rave enough about Strawberry Hedgehog! Completely natural, vegan, quality ingredients. Made with heart by a small business with loads of integrity and love for the community. And woman owned! the monthly soap club is such a great deal and a fun surprise to arrive in the mail! Gazillions of creative and terrific combinations to choose from truly fabulous!",2
Terrible customer service. Place is run by a bunch of pot heads who can barely remember the last four words you said let alone your order. Had bad service once before after ordering a pizza only to find out upon picking it up that they were out of one of the ingredients and hadn't even made anything yet. Will not return here again. Sad.,1
"FYI just wanted to let anyone know that may be listening, I just noticed I had a email response from the Manager at Caballero Grill sorry for the service we got and wanted some feedback from me. Just saw it have not gotten back, so it seems it could have been just a 'bad' night for us and the Management is on their game over there, will update it anything changes.",1
"HORRIBLE DERMATOLOGY! A NIGHTMARE! Doctor misdiagnosed my problem and that of my husband's. As if that wasn't bad enough, they keep making a mistake with billing and mine went to collections, while my husband's was paid. It's the same insurance! Many phone calls later, and I'm finally paying this bill.for absolutely NOTHING to clear this up. BEWARE!",1
"WORST. I really tried to like it here, and was definitely excited to go to a LGBT friendly club.but seriously, this place was horrible. The DJ just kept playing different iterations of the same song Animal over and over and over again.for 2 whole hours. It was also pretty empty for a Sat night, and they charged me 5 for a soda right at 12 05 bc the free drinks was over.MEAN!",1
"Thank you Hillstone, for taking great care of me when my order was running later thaormal. Your customer service is the best of the best. Also, the traditional house salad is amazing! For those going for lunch or dinner the food is fantastic so expect to wait unless you get there early but it's worth it.",2
"XS is the business. First time to the club and did it right. Table service and sick hip hop house music all night! Drinks kept coming and coming. Great experience. The ambiance was excellent! Heard XS n Marquee are the two hardest club to get a table, but we got hooked up! Pretty cool. Recommend this spot. Until next time XS.",2
"As far as buses come, you can't really ask for much more. nRuns every 15 min I think so pretty regular. Takes 30 min waverly station to airport. nDrivers seem friendlier than most. nMost noticeable difference from other buses is the massive amount of legroom and fancy leather seats. nAll in all a good deal for u00a36 return I reckon.",2
"Friendly staff, beautiful horses, and excellent facilities a perfect recipe for a serene trail ride through the woods. Go with your significant other or bring your kids and enjoy the ride. Note that, if you have young children, they will need to pass a short riding test to participate. I've been so impressed that I might even try a few private lessons to improve my horse riding skills.",2
"I love Panera! Their food everything, and I do mean everything I taste is absolutely wonderful. I love their pumpkin muffies. The muffies are muffin tips with no body. Delicious! I love tyre fact that they have fountain green tea! Not a big fan of their lemonade though. If you have never gone to Panera you are truly missing out. GO NOW!",2
Went here when the grand reopened for lunch and was really impressed so my gf and i decided to give it another try. Menu had been changed. My gfs grilled cheese tasted like fish and despite my filet mignon being ok it wasnt worth the money i paid and i had a discount. Service sucked too despite the place being empty.,1
"I Love True REST Float Spa! I've been floating for about a year now. True REST is an amazing therapy for all of us for whatever life you live. The oxygen bar, fish tank, tea and water are all great as well The spa team members all have such wonderful aura about them. It's quiet, clean, relaxing just peaceful. nMy only wish would be to bring one closer to home. nI recommend this to everyone!",2
"Came Friday night and had a great time at Michael franti concert. The venue, employees and atmosphere were great! Came back Saturday morning for breakfast and was very disappointed. Food service was slow and order eventually came incorrect. Food itself was one star, Denny's quality food.blech! nSummary come for music atmosphere and drinks but don't eat the food.",1
"Blanco was very good. It was hoppin on a Friday night, unlike many of the other restaurants in Scottsdale Phoenix in this economy. The menu is a bit limited, but they do great with the Mexican style dishes like tacos and cheesy dips that they do offer. Our service at the bar was fantastic and the Margaritas were delicious ",2
"I frequent the newly remodeled Grayhawk location. Whether you are looking for a great spot for drinks and sports or have hunger pains, you can always count on a great experience here. Monster portions, delicious burgers, salads, appetizers, sandwiches and more! Indoor outdoor seating, patio heaters for brisk AZ nights! A favorite local spot! Highly recommend.",2
Well my wife just picked up some dinner for us since she was running late from work. Unfortunately it just went in the trash. This was the worst food I have had In my mouth in years. I have been eating Panda for many years and have never had any thing like this before. It is terrible. I am a fan of Panda but will never eat at this one again. This is my second bad experience at this location.,1
"You don't even deserve a star! Two appointments in a week, over 30 minutes late the first time with a 4 hour window with No call and No apology for being late! Today another 4 hour window today and NO SHOW, NO CALL! nI do NOT recommend this company! If you have an account here I'd cancel it! Disgusted, now I have to take yet another day to be here to get my washing machine fixed!",1
"Very disappointing and a huge letdown. Service was like a snail, tables were dirty, and the wings were worse than the ones I've had in my freezer for 2 years. I usually don't write reviews but I have to warn people about this because it is very disappointing to say the least. If you have a choice go somewhere else!",1
"Beautiful space, well curated stalls, great lighting and it's CLEAN! oddly enough, few of these things can be said for many antique malls . Each stall here seems to have a specialty and while many are a bit overpriced, they are clearly well kept and the management staff of the mall are friendly and helpful. I love going to Odana and look forward to visits every time I'm in WI.",2
"Meh, this place is okay, went here for a wsop tournament. It is annoying how you have to take a cab too and from this place. I also saw Penn and Teller here which was awesome, would definitely recommend that. I have heard from a few other poker player that the Rio has huge problems with theft around the wsop",1
"I went tonight at this restaurant for the first time, the food was ok. What I really didn't like was the service was terrible, especially the waitress who served us not the young and skinny one but the older one with bangs. There are many places where the ramen and service are way more better. Wouldn't go there anymore.",1
"Haven't been to Chaya since they moved. The new space is a lot bigger and the food is still fantastic. The ingredients are all top notch right down to the fresh wasabi! Nothing flashy here. It's just authentic, high quality Japanese food. Easily the best sushi in Pittsburgh. The tempura is great too. I need to come back more often to try more of the non sushi items.",2

"This place blows. Went to get 90 min massage mon am at 10 and she says there is no time for a 90 min. Saying it as if I was disturbing HER! Then. I ""checked in "" for the 49 yelp deal and she tells me it's not for this place. Helllllo. I followed the directions here from yelp. Insisting I'm at the wrong place. I finally just walked out. Lame",1
"La Loma is hands down my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Arizona! The enchilada's are addicting! I could seriously eat here every day and there have been many weeks where I have eaten here 4 or 5 times! My advice is give it a try, I have taken many friends here and they have all been as pleased as I am with this place!",2
"It's an ""okay "" buffet at an ""okay "" property. Usually go for brunch on Sundays but their options are repeated on the different style tables. Staff is, once again, ""okay "" since they are just there to react rather than to act. Takes a while to get a table sometimes but in the end there is always ice cream and dessert, which makes everything a tad bit better.",1
"AWESOME PLACE. The food was delicious and the presentation was perfect. The waiter was pretty funny too, and the rest of the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Great place to go to grab excellent food, better than the strip! Prices were a lot better too. I highly recommend this place if you are staying in Vegas and want more for your buck. We'll be back ",2
"The service here sucks. My sister asked a salesperson for a size to try on for shoes and she said hold up and never came back. As we were waiting for her to come back which she never did , we could see other salespeople just standing around talking to each other. This store is lazy and the workers don't look happy or willing to help.",1
Service was terrible. Wait was horrific even for Vegas. The entire staff was very rude and we are experienced dinners from So. Cal. We will never return here and we have eaten here before two separate times. I don't know what has happened here. Couldn't recommend it. Fix your helps attitudes towards customers.,1
"i don't know where to start. girls not in for free, even though the promoters said so. very small room and not the best environment. If by chance you actually get a drink that is if the bartenders ever get to you, that drinks probably gonna be watered down. Im not huge into clubs but ive definitely had more fun than i did at this place.",1
"I love this place! It's in the neighborhood so I tend to dine here a lot. The sushi is always top notch if it's not to your standards, there's no problem sending it back. I wouldn't recommend the tempura it's a little too heavily fried for me. It's also fantastic that you can bring in wine from neighboring Wine Store without a corkage fee. Try the specialty martinis also.amazing!",2
"For a moral lunch, I got the office a half dozen cupcakes and half dozen cookies. The red velvet cupcake and cookies are AMAZING! The salted caramel is delicious too! I didn't get to try the others, but the plates were empty in the matter of minutes and this office doesn't care for sweets, so that says a LOT . Totally recommend their deserts here.",2
"I absolutely love Joe's Farm Grill! I've had pizza, burgers, BBQ, salads, fish, and hot dogs. Every item is great. The salads are especially good, probably because they grow the greens right there on the farm. If you like Joe's you should try the sister restaurant in downtown Gilbert Joe's Real BBQ.",2
"I would like to Yelp my awesome hair stylist ""Kimba "". She turned my headwreck into a masterpiece. Beautiful red highlights, cute updated hair cut. The entire staff is down to earth and friendly. It was a great experience and you don't have to pay an outrageous price. nIf you want to look Marvelous on a budget, you need to contact Kimba! nThanks for making me beautiful ",2
Definitely the place to go for your threading needs. My wife went in for a session. The owner was not only very welcoming but very knowledgeable about what she was doing. She also gave her a 15 discount as a first time customer. Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for an affordable yet professional threading place. Give this place a try.,2
"Service was great,rooms were clean,we had to call room service in order for them to bring us some more towels. They didn't clean the room while we were away on the strip which could be a good thing and bad thing. But overall great service. I'll only recommend that they put in iPod docks so we can listen to soft music while taking a shower or unpacking.",2
"Theresa is amazing! I'm addicted to my lashes, they're easy and no more mascara. I get so many compliments on them, even my dermatologist thought I was using Latisse and when I told her they're extension she wanted Lash's card! I've sent several friends who are now loving the look. Lash is so much less expensive than a general salon, too. I recommend ""The Lounge "" to all my friends.",2
I've been here quite a few times and it's the cleanest Chinese buffet in the area. Food is of high quality especially the seafood. The only buffet sushi I feel safe eating. Lunch is reasonably priced and even though dinner is a little pricey it's worth it. One time I found a hair in the ice cream so that was a bummer.,2
"Love this place! It's by far my favorite bar in the Phoenix area. The drinks are always cheap especially if you come on a Wednesday or Saturday when everything is 2 4 1. They always play great music, and show the music videos on the wall as your favorite songs are playing. Even my straight girl friends agree that this is the most fun bar in town!",2
"Unfortunately, the long wait for our food roughly 45 mins after we ordered and they were not busy , drinks never refilled and 2 out of the 3 orders being wrong I can safely say the likelihood of me going back is very slim. The only redeeming quality is that the food is rather good but not good enough to endure the experience again.",1
Not a good experience.The people working at customer service acted like we didn't exist and acted like their job was sooo hard. All I wanted to do was exchnage some ink cartridges for some coupons. I was new to this myslef and they expected me to know everything about it. I will not be coming back to this location.,1
worst barber shop with terrible barber for 50 dollars jason will push your hairline back and leave cuts all over your cheeks and chin and to be fair i went and tried a different barber this barber not only pushed my hair back and did not give me a skin tapper he left my line up crooked i would never recommend a single person here not on their worse hair day,1
Didnt even get to eat. After waiting a few minutes in a dead restaurant to be seated we were sat on the patio and left for 6 7 minutes so I decided we would eat somewhere else. When I was leaving at least three people attentively said goodbye. I normally like their wings but this was not a good experience for me.,1
This place is great! I can't get over how delicious the tortillas are. Most people think of a burrito and think of all the things that go in it but the secret to a great burrito is the flour tortillas. This place nailed it. Next time you order a burrito stop and smell the great smell of their hand made flour tortillas!,2
"I love RNR. The bottomless mimosas are always great on a lazy Sunday Funday. Most of the food I've had there has been really good and the service is pretty quick too. My advice is to arrive early on Sunday, like before 11am. Afterward it gets super busy. Also you can alternate between mimosas and bloody Mary's for bottomless.",2
This place has been spiffed up a lot since last time I went a year ago . The banchan were good mainly different kinds of kimchi . The dol sot bi bim bab was everything you could ask of a bowl of blazing hot rice and veg. The beer was cold. The service was timely and not intrusive. The menu has a lot of interesting things for which I will certainly return. Yay for actual Korean food in Charlotte.,2
I used to be a fan of this place. UNTIL I found a freaking BAND AID IN MY SOUP. I told the cook about it and he just apologized and threw the soup out. They didn't even bother giving me and my friend a refund until I complained about how I didn't eat. And the guy only ended up giving me one refund when there were two people eating out of the soup ,1
"Rented a home in summerlin, they wont fix anything. The home was broken into several times they dont care. total con artist slum lords. RUN AWAY! Dont do it! I held in there for two years, it was honestly the worst experience of my adult life. Total Las Vegas Con There really are far better out there. I have found an amazing Property Management company. Dont do it, seriously.",1
"Amazing 50 minute massage by Maria! If she lived by me, I would get a massage once a week from here. I felt so tense and anxious before going in and walked out on clouds! She added some fabulous peppermint oil to my neck wrap that was unbelievable! I even bought it! Outstanding experience! Thank you!",2
"I was on my way back to the hotel from Marche Jean Talon and super hungry. Came accross this ramen place on St. Laurent Blvd. Ramen was pretty good, you can't really benchmark against the one that they have in NYC. It's quite good. Ordered the tonkotsu and pork cheek. Both of them were delicious, fatty, and salty. If you're in Montreal and in the mood for Ramen, come visit this place.",2
"Really good food! I had the huevos rancheros burger a that was amazing! The best selection is decent.had a pumpkin porter which was amazing but not enough selection of dark beer. The beer selection itself wasn't the greatest. The bartender was very nice and made sure I had everything I needed, even when she was running around trying to do a million things at once.",2
"Not sure why my earlier review did not post. This place is fantastic! The staff is knowledgeable and pleasant. Prices are reasonable and negotiable. I could spend a week there and never see it all. Military, pottery, mid century everything, old toys, architectural relics, art work. On and on! The parking situation is not great but it's worth it.",2
"Simple concept, executed very well. Fresh salads, made to order, and pretty affordable. I don't give 5 stars to many businesses, but Salad and Go is doing everything right. I'm not a big fan of salad, but for a healthy alternative, it is really good, and there's lots of variety. I've been twice so far, and will probably become a regular.",2
"Wow! So first of all their stuff is overpriced, criminally overpriced. Second all they do pretty much all pawn shops FYI is look up eBay prices and offer you like 25 of what they could sell it for on eBay. Even knowing that this place fails hard. 100 offer for iPhone 5c with all the accessories. What a joke.",1
"5 star view, good decor. Good, pricey drinks, not too excessive though considering the venue. We had bolognese fries which were not good. I should have sent them back, but i eat what's in front of me if it's edible. Service was a bit slow. It took a while to place our order, but once we did they came out in a reasonable amount of time.",2
Okay with a name like BWW I knew they knew what they were doing aside the drinks from the bar. They Sucked Big Time ! food was whack! as my wife explained it was a place to go to watch sports and drink beers and after a 6 pack anything taste good. Not the BWW I knew in California . NEVER AGAIN Spent almost 70.00 and felt robbed.,1
"The manager was the one adding my final ingredients salsas, cheese, guac, lettuce and was skimping on everything. She rolled her eyes when I asked for more. The cashier was so delightful and the food was great as always but I am disappointed in seeing a manager acting like that. The food itself was good but the experience really ruined it for me especially from such a great company like Chipotle.",1
"This is the convenience store attached to the Shell Gas station where I usually fill the cars up. It really is convenient since it's down the street from where I live, in the same area as the supermarket, Rocco's, the dry cleaners and across the street from Discovery Park. They also have a Post Office Express inside, in case you don't feel like making that trip to the Post Office.",2
"After my air went out on Thursday evening, I sent an email requesting an appointment the next morning. Same evening I received an email response as well as a call. Long story short, my air conditioner was not repairable. Legacy installed a new unit within hours. Outstanding professionals and service.",2
"The bathrooms in this place is terrifying. I'm literally never coming back here because it's so terrifying. I don't need distorted photos of kids and babies staring at me as I pee. Please. Other than that, it's pretty basic bar food. The non bathroom parts of it are pretty cool and the staff is nice enough.",1
"This USED to be our favorite restaurant the food is SALTY, the chicken was dry.the steak was tough.the lettuce in the salad was watery and of all days it was our anniversary .plus my amex number was stolen within 20 minutes after paying the bill at Carrabba's I called and someone did apologize.said they would send a gift card.and that never came If you go there.pay in CASH!",1
"This cafe is dedicated to providing delicious smoothies, juices, and food with the highest quality possible ingredients. I love that they use local produce when they can and i think are plastic free. I just had a delicious banana cacao almond smoothie that was huge and filling for just under 8. I will definitely return!",2
"Stopped into this new location today for a pair of their Rugged Exposure Journey Plus walking shoes. I've been buying shoes at Big 5 for many years have always done well with them. This variety, for example, are comfortable right from the start last me a couple of years. That's better performance for 20 than I get from Florsheim's that cost 100! ",2
Stayed here a number of times when I was back in the area visiting old college friends. The location of this hotel is very convenient to both Pitt and CMU. They also have comfortable beds and an indoor pool although I've never been swimming there. The hotel has recently been updated and I think it looks pretty ok. Parking is avalible if you pay extra.,2
"The food wasn't bad.just not that good. Service was a little bad, I took my buddy here for ramen after his recent move back from Japan.and after having to ask a few times for stuff, and then them making some juice ? close to wear we were sitting, in the bar, it was so loud we had to continuously stop our conversation until they stopped we both decided never to come back. Such a shame.",1
"We dined here Tonite for our Valentine dinner, I had the beef tenderloin, it was Absolutely melt in your mouth every bite on my plate delicious! I just love the atmosphere, and love the shiny white wood ceilings and the black and white silent movies they play on sheets of glass. It's pricey but very worth it, and can't wait to go back.",2
Always a Pittsburgh staple when I make it back. Southside is a good alternative to the Strip District. I spent a lot of the late 80's and 90's elbowing to get a sandwich late night there. So a little crowd on the Southside is nothing. Pastrami was a little tough today. But the taste was on point. Staff were on it. My staple is cap egg n cheese. I'll be back before I head back west.,2
Have been enjoying Crust since it opened about 2 years ago. The pizza is very good! Comes in a cute eiffel tower shape. The deserts are awesome and you can take them to go! The wine selection is pretty small but they are choice bottles without being overpriced! The owners are very laid back but its a fun little small place.,2
"Stopped in for a drink after a long bike ride. Total dive bar, but patrons and staff were very friendly. I didnt have a bike lock and the patrons owner said i could just bring in the bike while I got smashed. I must have spent about 20 after being there for 2 3 hours. I think the beers are 2. Its a cash only bar, but they have an ATM in the front. I will definitely be heading there again soon.",2
Place is clean! But I have beeow for several gel manicures and each time the girl has done my nails I get lumps in my polish? Is it the polish is old or how she is applying it? Went one time and one of the guys did my gel nails and no problem? So as it is not cheap I am sure there are other places where you can get a consistent application?,1
"Great food, quiet ambience. Everything tasted like good quality, the fish, the bread. We went on the night before a major hurricane warning when it was quite empty, so I can't say what the noise level was really like on an average night. When searching for the restroom, it was strange how one of the hostesses quickly asked where I was going, as if I might run away with the fine china.",2
"This place was great. Not sure if they got a new owner or a cheap one. Could tell a difference in food quality, and they had the shittest forks! If that cheap bastard bought those forks, he needs to get out of the industry. So I recommend, if you want good food go somewhere else. Want a good laugh, go in and see the forks!",1
"An instant favourite of mine, Nouveau Palais has become THE place I introduce my visiting friends to. From the burger to the spaetzle to the serving of cookies and milk for dessert, the food here never disappoints. The Palais is a definite local hangout, with great service, great drinks, and great music.",2
"We finally ended up here after deciding not to wait in line for the buffet at the Wynn. My friend and I both ordered the pastrami burger since it was recommended by the lady behind the counter. It took forever to get our food and was pretty pricey for a burger. I didn't know it was gonna have double meat beef and slices of pastrami on top! Wow, I was so full after finishing the whole thing.",2
"I wanted to like the pizza here, but was disappointed. The pizza came out slightly cold and with extremely thick, chewy cheese. The rest of the ingredients were good, but I could not get past the hard, thick, chewy cheese. I actually had to pick off the cheese and eat just the rest of the pizza. I order the white pizza without tomato sauce.",1
"The food was alright, not earth shattering. More than anything the service was terrible! They screwed up out order, and instead of making our food immediately, they spent a good 10 minutes of trying to figure out how they messed it up. So what should have been a 15 minute wait for food, we waited over 30. To top it off, we weren't offered any consultation or compensation for the additional wait.",1
"Not a bad place to grab a drink if price is your concern. Food menu is slim and nothing was that good. We ordered nsweet potato fries good flavor, a bit limp, nice honey dip nonion rings crispy, fried part fell off of the onions nspinach artichoke dip liked the taste of it but there were HUGE artichoke chunks that were too big to eat Popular place for karaoke, or at least it sounded like it.",1
"Under New Management! I've had my car since February 2012. I had been bringing it here because my contract included a lifetime oil change for 9.99. Awesome, right! WRONG! Now that they've relocated have undergone new management they no longer honor that 9.99 price. And to top it off, my wait time for an oil change was 1.5 hours. What a waste of time! I wouldn't recommend this Dealership to anyone!",1
"I realize there are plenty of local coffee shops in Madison, and I love them too, but this one just happens to be on my way to work AND it has a drive through. Sometimes convenience wins. It also happens to have a super friendly and energetic staff that is always so kind and really brightens my morning commute.",2
".we landed at Sirio after being coldly ""we are so full that we can't care less about you two'ed "" at Jean ""Jorge "" next door. Sirio is a very nice place. everyone is very professional and courteous, from hostess to waiters. They actually WELCOME your business. excellent food, reasonable price. Sorry Sirio we haven't gone there before. we live in LV, we definitely will go back. Sirio is a 10 .",2
Came here after the Scion party at Body English. Wow 30 cover to get in. I guess the girls here are pretty hot though so it's probably worth it for a guy. We sat by one of the stages where they had 3 girls dancing at a time. My pet peeve is strippers that can't dance so at least the girls here can dance. Drinks are hella expensive. 12 for water?!?!,2
"The check in service was great. The lady who helped us get settled was so nice and gave us drink tickets! The rooms were a good size, beds were comfortable and everything was clean. I wish the bathrooms were a bit bigger but that's only because we have 5 girls in a room. Definitely a good location on the strip!",2
"If there were a prize for 'Worst of Las Vegas', this ""restaurant "" would win first place! It would also win worst place for service, food quality, and wait time you can wait more than 30 min for the worst crepe that you could ever eat . nP.S. If you write them on Yelp what you think of their business, they will rudely reply WTF!",1
"I like Popeye's normally, but we were eating lunch there about 6 months ago and there was a employee sweeping the floors. then the tables. Yeah Sweeping the tables. with the same broom. First he was doing it backwards. He should of swept the table then the floor. so he wouldn't need to resweep the floor. Second WHY ARE YOU SWEEPING THE TABLES WITH THE FLOOR BROOM! We have not been back.",1
"Cash only. My only issue. I love their red sauce. Just love it. A large bag of chips is 3 and comes with 12 oz of the sauce. A small bag is 2 and comes with 6 oz of the sauce. It's the best red sauce I've ever had. I love their carne asada, but my girlfriend doesn't like their cheese so I go myself now.",2
"This is a good, affordable French restaurant. Food is probably 3 stars. 4 stars for the ability to eat on the patio. We ordered primarily side dishes and sat outside on their patio, watching people walk by on the strip and sort of seeing the Bellagio fountains across the street. The french onion soup and ratatouille were solid. Not the best in the world, but good.",2
This is the very sucks place i ever seen. The manager is a bitch. She charged every fucking things that you tried to order like hot tea or lemon? what the fuck?! Don't waste your money on this restaurant I seriously said this. The manageris being so stupid as fuck! Charging 15 for service ? Is it make sense?,1
"If I could, I'd give Dunkin' Donuts way more than 5 stars. I mean, hello, this is Dunkin' Donuts we are talking about! I'm a poor, deprived Southern California girl who doesn't get to partake in the Dunkin' Donuts Boston Creme goodness all that often. When I saw the signs on Fremont Street, I started screaming. I had one Boston Creme donut a day. Oh, yes, I did. I love you, Dunkin' Donuts!",2
"Loyalty program is crap. Takes over two months for you to be in the system, and they won't let you use an employee card or whatever to get the discount in the meantime. Instead your choices are pay full price or fill out another application. Hey, I think I'll just leave and you can put away my cart full of groceries .",1
"Watch out, and maybe avoid. The cashier lady will yell or raise her voice at you if you so much as make a misstep ordering. By that I mean that you need to know you want ""Stir Fry, w x flavoring "", speak really clearly or else she'll snap at you. I almost walked out. Doesn't matter if you're speaking French or English, this will happen. Wonder what Concordia students think. ",1
"This is by far the best Sushi in Pittsburgh. The food is all amazing, very fresh and authentic, and I still compare most places I have been to Little Tokyo. Other than that, I don't have much to say because this restaurant really speaks for itself. What you wont find here A trendy atmosphere like Nakama I picked Nakama because it is also so popular in PGH , but the sushi MORE than makes up for it.",2
"I eat here a couple of times a month. The food is fresh and tasty. I believe this is one of the best Oriental Buffets in Las Vegas. If, you have one that is better than this, let me know. The atmosphere is modern and clean. music is played at a comfortable level. The price includes a drink . they have all kinds of drinks Soft Drinks nTea nThai Tea nCoffee and more.",2
"I've now tried Manny's twice.both times were equally terrible. The food comes in at a decent price point but certainly not great. Especially considering how hard it seems to be for them to get an order right, and or serve quality food. I've had the fajitas, they were bland and boring. There salsa is on par with the Pace you pick up at the grocery store. We will not go back for a third try.",1
"Tobias is a wonderful local car and truck repair. We have been using them for 4 years and I can't say enough about how professional, honest and thorough they are. Chuck, Chris, Jason the whole crew is nice. They keep you informed! They also have a courtesy vehicle. Such a great Local Cave Creek complete auto care. Thanks!",2
"I work in the area and have been here a few times. First time was amazing. Every other time after that, the service has been horrible. Food quality has been horrible. I'm not going back. Having a crap experience on your lunch break just STINKS! Especially when you order a chicken Caesar salad and it takes longer than a well done burger and the bartender tries to defend the wait.",1
"What the hell is going on with this place. Was so excited for it to open up as a local. Terrible service everywhere, wayyyy over priced, glasses are dirty at the bar. If you're gonna promote a high end sheik place, act like it. Honestly, stay at the tropicana or the west gate for much better service and prices.",1
"This little tiny restaurant which I NEVER knew was there! is definitely tied for the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. The penne alla vodka was amazing as well. Two small pizzas and two pasta dishes filled up the 4 of us to the brim! Great atmosphere, reasonable prices, amazing food and excellent, friendly service.I'll definitely be bringing my family here the next time they visit Phoenix!",2
This place is NOT Caribbean food! It's terrible. You must ask for a drink separate from the combo even though you've ordered a combo. They're not going to offer it to you either. The food tastes horrible. I wish I could sit outside and turn people around to save their souls. But unfortunately this is all I can do. Take heed and go elsewhere!,1
Love this casino! The center bar area is awesome! The bar is sunken and is very trendy. Haven't had the pleasure of eating at the steakhouse yet.they're reservations fill crazy fast! Was there at 5 30 the first available reservation wasn't until 8pm. Book the hotel early too. I tried to book it 2 weeks in advance they have been full.,2
"Sorry, this place sucked. It was crowded, the service was absolutely awful and the food was mediocre. I was literally asked for my I'D 3 separate times I'm 45 by the way AND you're only ""allowed "" 1 drink at the bar per ID. even though the waitress at the table took at least 45 minutes between rounds. yeah, NEVER going back to this establishment.",1
This hotel needs to be renovated and maintained. The hallway rugs need stretching and cleaning. Our room was clean. The shower spout put more water in the tub then in the actual shower head. The sink was cracked. The floors are laminated and are actually quite boring an drab. Outside the property the area is strewn with garbage. Do yourself a favor and stay someplace else.,1
"Yikes. This was terrible. Ever been to a show and you think wow there is like nobody in here. The performers were ok but nothing special. If you are given free tickets go ahead and go otherwise try something else. I love Sinatra, Martin, Crosby etc music but the show was like a hollow version of it. I was bored 10 min in and couldn't wait till it was over. Skip this show.",1
"I don't go here anymore, they never have reg cream donuts I asked if they would make cream donuts without the chocolate on top they told me no. In New York all bakery's sell cream donuts like that and with chocolate on top, and when you walk into the bakery's they are always the 1st to be sold out. What is wrong with these yo yo running this business.",1
Ian's mac and cheese pizza was a late night staple of mine at bar time in college. So many different slices to choose from! They have some very original pizza toppings as well as the classics. They also deliver which is great for lazy evenings with friends. Whole pies can get a little pricey when your order with specialty toppings but it is so good that it's worth it!,2
Special visitor so I wanted to try the regular menu. Mac and Cheese with truffles and three types of cheeses best I have ever had. friends in my life I have had ALOT of the stuff. Special was halbut with beet couscous. amazing. They were also offering a three course pre fix for 36. There cocktails have as much flavor as the meal.a must try.,2
"The lady I went to was still drunk from New Years, she wasn't listening to exactly what I wanted it was what she wanted to do and how to get me out of there quickly. I asked for short and natural and got flared c cuts that were extra thick, I was so unhappy and you could tell when I left, still paid and left a tip. I will never be back. Awful place, awful customer service.",1
"My dinner was wonderful there, but alas it was the Fireside Room that made the overall experience beyond awesome. What a nice place to hang with friends and strangers alike. The atmosphere is intimate. The staff is quick to help you, and time flies while one is having fun there. Hands down I wish we had something like the Fireside in the Twin Cities.",2
"This place was GREAT. I had already had a place in mind that I was gonna go to. While driving there I saw this spot and decided to check it out. There were already people waiting so I figured Id have to do the same. Spoke with the guy about buying one used tire. They had my car size and 20 minutes and 35 later, I was on my way. Friendly, Fast, and Cost Effective.",2
"This place is just horrendous. The first time I moved here we went looking for a good Mexican place to eat and found this place. Our food tasted like it was microwaved and not authentic at all. This is a white man's version of Mexican food. I might as well buy canned Mexican meals or frozen ones, much cheaper that way. Don't come here if you want a days long of stomach aches and regrets.",1
I feel like I've entered an 80s gym! Once you've been to a brand new 24 Hour location its had to visit one of their old locations. This location is somewhat close to my house but I only go if I really want to work out. Most of the treadmills don't work and a couple of the ellipticals make squeaking noises. I wish and hope there's some upgrades planned for this location soon.,1
"Grounds are pretty, dated property. Therefore the greeting staff valet, bell men, front desk needs to be top notch which they are not. No smiles, no warmth, impatient and unknowledgable when asked asked a basic question the street name parallel to the running walking path. Get nice, people! There are many other resort options in the beautiful Valley of the Sun.",1
"Charlotte. nI have eaten at Oggi's at least a dozen times. I try something new almost every time I go and everything I have tried has been wonderful. The service is great! Lynn has waited on us several times and she is always fun, nice and and an excellent server. nSo far, everyone I have taken to Oggi's, has not been disappointed!",2
"I called on a Sat at 5 30 ready to leave a message a tech answers and, to my surprise, walks me thru some troubleshooting steps my condenser fan wasn't running . We narrow it down to two parts which I bought in to their shop the next day. He tested the parts for me and sold me the proper replacement. Super helpful, very knowledgeable, lots of parts on hand this company deserve your business!",2
"I love Fresh Easy and am so happy to have a store 3 minutes from my house in Henderson. It's the only grocery store I use and I recommend them to my clients ieed of time management tips. The fresh meals, meal ideas and small portions work for singles, newlyweds and families. Love, love, love my Fresh Easy!",2
"Just had my initial consultation with Dave and so far I am impressed. He showed within hours of my initial call, inspected my house and quoted me a fair rate. My first impression is that they run very professional operation and pay close attention to product quality and customer service. I am signing up for regular service.",2
"Felt like burgers and this place did not do the trick. Burgers were ordinary. Service sucked, seriously how do you mess up a salad that just needed lettuce and ranch. Also was not informed that the potato twisters come in one side and they even messed that up. The only saving grace here is the ghost pepper salsa which was delicious. Will not be coming here again.",1
"This cupcake shop is hit or miss. The last time I was there I ordered 5 cupcakes. One for myself and 4 boxed up to give to a friend for a small birthday gift on top of the gift I purchased for her. well, need to say my milk chocolate cupcake was raw and not thoroughly cooked inside. Have not been back since.",1
"The ribs were GOOD! The service wasn't bad but it wasn't great. The menu is simple and I liked that. The house beer was actually pretty tasty for 1.75. nThe sides were pretty nasty the baked beans and Cole slaw Yuck. And right when I was seated I got bbq sauce on my shirt, which means the table wasn't clean. Overall I say Try it. You'll like it.",2
"That was a terrible experience. Made an appt to test drive a car q50 tech which I confirmed they had in stock. Showed up, car is missing and they lost the key for the other car in stock. Really? What's the point of making an appointment? Typical experience I'd expect at a ford dealership definitely not one I'd expect from a ""luxury "" brand.",1
"The service here BITES! I hate to be mean, but seriously if there are only two tables busy we should NOT have to do the coffee dance to get refills! n We have waited for up to 15 minutes to have someone come to our table, and will only go when they have Hobbit Breakfast at this point, or drive Hell and gone to the other Dennys. n Unless you can't get to another just skip this place.",1
"I ordered 4000 map tacks for an art project through the Map Shop. I had contacted them via email to ask about some of the colors and Philip spent so much time with me making sure I was happy with my purchase. He even sent me pictures of the various colors! So helpful, customer service at its finest. Price wise, they beat the other companies I contacted and had a much better selection as well.",2
"The service is some of the worst I've had, even for it being in an airport. Our server was rude and consistently rolling her eyes at everything, giving disgusted looks, and taking forever to do anything. The salsa was runny. The queso was just plain melted cheese. But, the margarita decent and that's all I really cared about at the time.",1
Pros Cons Great Service ncame next day in the morning as requested ngreat deal as I applied the Yelp voucher currently available ntechnician Jerome took his time in explaining things to me above and beyond his responsibilities for some wifi features and explained how to improve efficiency. Thank you guys!,2
"Beware. Run, do not walk from this restaurant. Never thought I'd say that about a restaurant, but the cook might be better as a garbage collector 'cause she did an excellent job scraping up the slimy gunk that might have formerly been lettuce on my club sandwich tonight. Any recommendations for food poisoning ERs?",1
"Full body massage for a good price. The best part about it was they managed to hit the tickle spots on my feet which made the experience even more exciting, and they somehow managed to work in an elevator music version of ""Santa clause comes to town "" in the music mix true story . I will definitely be coming back.",2
i was there for the first time a few weeks ago. Dropped off both of my kids and when I picked them up a few hours later the boys said that they were hit the whole way home. Also brought stuff to change diapers and they did not do that and sat in dirty diapers for hours. I filed a complaint and there offer was to come back and get a tour. NO THANKS! never going back. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS HERE!,1
"This is a pretty cool venue, Relatively close to town just just off the road there is this ranch. Run be friendly people where you can do some western things. Horse back rides. Fires with s'mores, practice your lasso. The entrance can be hard to find at night, just make a left at jomax and then the first left.",2
Fantastic place. All kinds of options. Long lines on the good stuff. So when your looking to see what looks the best I would recommend just follow the line of people. Great past and seafood options. Service is great the staff takes pride in what they do. Desert time is always my favorite. And here the little pies and stuff topped off the meal well,2
"Howard Howard Howard! Haha this man is just plain awesome. Love how he can just go with a theme and then bounce jokes off it for days. Also love that he can include the audience in his stand up. The crowed at this club was great minus the A hole that couldn't take a joke. Loved the ambience, simple yet inviting. Great find for my first night out in Scottsdale. Hope to be back soon. Cheers!",2
"The manager of the restaurant contacted me and was able to get us the reservation on the date we originally wanted. We very much enjoyed the food and the service. I appreciate the gesture to rectify our experience, but we shall see if the reservations process is fixed the next time we try to go here.",2
"We have been coming here for over 20 years. We are never disappointed with food quality and service. They remember you by name and make you feel welcome. They have recently expanded. Very clean, very family oriented. A great menu with a mixture of local Hawaiian foods and Korean foods. Our favorites are the friend mandu and bulgogi.",2
"IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MATINEES, BABY. Tickets are cheaaap! Only 5 smackeroonies for a matinee, 7.50 otherwise? It's totally worth it if you're down to ditch the frilly stuff and just kick back with some popcorn or air. Air is free . You can snag tickets ahead of time on Fandango for another buck 25 or so.",2
A lovely little restaurant with nice intimate settings. Food was lovely and so fresh tasting king prawn and chicken satay starters were excellent. Was looking forward to mixed fish dish for the main but they were out of scallops which was a bit disappointing. However they made up by substituting them with octopus. Have had takeaway from here in the past and been impressed. Recommended.,2
The lychee gelato was dilizioso! I let each scoop melt on my tongue so I could enjoy every ounce of it. 1 scoop for 5.50 better be worth it! Nicole loved the iced mocha drink so much that she shelled out 7.50 for it. On two occasions. They must have shipped that coffee in directly from Italy. It's Vegas. INDULGE!,2
"Sitting at my desk, wondering why the day seems so long, then realizing my watch battery died 3 hours ago! Saw the reviews for Gemtime, and it's close to where I work, so I gave them a shot. Greeted as soon as I entered, was told to give them 10 minutes, had it done in 5, and for 10! Cannot be beat! Great, great, great.did I say that they were GREAT?!",2
"Looking on the bright side, the positives were the service was friendly and fast and the restaurant was clean and comfortable. Okay, now the negatives. The food we were given was Chinese food with a Chinese presentation. The liberal dosing of teriyaki sauce on indifferent ingredients does not make a meal Japanese. We were so disappointed.",1
"The food is way over priced. Spagetti had little sauce, Penne had only diced tomatoes as a sauce and came out 1 2 cold. Not home made at all. Don't bother. My glass of wine had the bottom full of the residue that you find at the bottom of an old bottle. I sent it back and was told I was given a glass from a new bottle. Basically a tourist trap. Waiter was good in his service",1
"King I has one of the best yellow currys Pad thai i've ever had. Full of vegetables super tasty and love the spice! nOn a trip to Vegas, I took my hubby to try it and he absolutely loved it too! He thinks it's the best thai food he's had. though, he's only been to maybe 3 or 4 different Thai places. but still, a place we'll eat every time we go to Vegas!",2
EWWW Line really long looks like all pizza was pre made and reheated and then reheated again. My pizza was luke warm so I went back to reheat it and it turned into a huge blob of grease. also not cheap each slice is 4.95 and they charge 3.50 for a fountain soda ! I actually did not eat the pizza because it was just way to greasy.,1
"If you're a traveler in a hurry then pass this one by, extremely slow service. Also don't expect a refill or second round of drinks, the servers are good at hiding in that place. Food was below expectations, cold fries and bland burger. Oh, and did I mention the waitress digging her fingernails into my back to scratch it, I did regret my choice of eatery.",1
"Mi Patio catering was food at a recent party I went to in Phoenix. Mostly great Mexican food, with a hint of Greek food thrown in I was told there was a family connection . Hence, delicious fajita filling AND guilt inducing spanakopita edit more like spinach filled egg rolls, to be precise . I prolly won't make it to Phoenix Friday tonight, but it'll be worth going!",2
Ok seriously I don't miss Arizona but I sure in the hell miss this place. I daydream about this place.I miss everything on the menu because trust me I tried it.I was a hungry pregnant women on the prawl.besides I loved the live music and the hummus was out of this WORLD! If you haven't gone.go you won't regret it.It's one of the few things about Arizona I miss.,2
"Went in on a Sunday mid morning. Seated promptly, then completely ignored from that point on. Got up and left after 15 minutes. The hostess gave us a blank stare as we walked out, and told her no one would wait on us. The staff did not seem to care at all. This is not the type of attitude and service you want from a place that prepares your food Danger, stay away!",1
I wasn't sure what to think when we walked in but the longer we hung out the more I really liked this place! Ive never seen so many beer options in one place. I had a delicious cheeseburger and a yummy beer. Quick service with a really friendly bartender. Curious to see what type of crowd they draw on a Saturday night.,2
Master Lock Security did a good job changing the front door locks. I wanted to change the lock to a double cylinder and he suggested just adding an additional lock on the back and not change the front thus preserving the finish. He came around and finished the work quickly and efficiently. Gave some helpful tips as well. I'll recommend to a friend.,2
"Wow! This girl is amazing. She gave me a beautiful, totally original hair style that I absolutely loved and no way could have done myself. Her ability with makeup is outstanding. My pics looked gorgeous. She is also very sweet, fun, and great to work with. I felt totally comfortable with her. Thanks, Steph Viva! You made my special day just perfect!",2
"Bradley Ogden's prix fixe menus are great values. I have eaten here twice and enjoyed both dinners immensely. The last meal I ate started with a cheese souffle I'm not an egg eater, but this was the bomb. The Duroc pork loin is amazing. Imagine a steak that tastes like bacon. You'd love it. Hell, you'd marry it. Then for dessert, bananas foster cake. Ok, wheel me out in a chair.",2
"Hands down, this is the best BBQ I have ever had. Always go really early or wait until after 12 30 although you risk there being less selection. The brisket is amazing and I could eat my weight in jalapeno cheese grits that's a lot of grits. I kind of want to tell everyone this place sucks just so there's more for me.",2
"Worst MDs I have ever been to. We visit many MDs with our grandson I will never come to this one ever again. Dirty tables, slow service, dirty drink Station, tv blaring, music going at the same time and they got my order wrong. They forgot my French fries. My order was only a mighty kids meal, a number 10 and a chicken wrap.",1
"Long story short we were walking back to our hotel from the Strip. We saw the sign for a 3 hot dog and a beer combo. It's just a hole in the wall dive bar casino with a convenience store in the back. The Waitress was great. And the hot dogs were fantastic. Big and juicy. Great deal for a late night, moderately drunk snack!",2
Just ordered food from here this evening for delivery. I have NO idea how this place gets 4 1 2 stars on here. It was the worst chinese food I have ever eaten. We ordered sesame chix which was soggy and gross. The eggrolls were overpriced and are more like a spring roll. the lomein is okay but will never get food from here again.,1
"This museum is top notch. If you're visiting Las Vegas, don't miss it! It's loaded with films, artifacts, media, an actual 1940's era intact office you can even test your own radioactivity. In addition to The Atomic Testing Museum, there was also an eye opening exhibition of Russian propaganda posters in the gallery next door, same building. Very impressive.",2
"Phenomenal! I had the occasion to go last night and although I have been going here for over 10 years, this is the first time I thought to write a yelp review for them. The food is absolutely worth every penny and the side dishes were perfection as well. I seem to always order more sides thaeeded but I still managed to eat everything.",2
I come here often in the evening night. The customer service is always top notch. The staff are super courteous and they get the orders correct all of the time. It's always timely as well. I have only come through here once and had a bit of a wait time. At that time they apologized and offered a free drink. This is my favorite Jack in the Box by far.,2
"Originally from Detroit, was feeling homesick and this is the only place that has authentic Detroit coneys. Anyone else who makes a coney and says they get their ingredients from MI doesn't mean they know how to make a coney. Coney Grill is Lafayette style straight from Detroit Hands down, my most favorite restaurant. If you're thinking about going, you're overthinking it, JUST GO! IT'S AMAZING!",2
"I'm done being disappointed by Burger King. From cold breakfasts, to incomplete orders, i've had it and I won't be back. nI loved their satis fries, but sadly those are gone, and with them any reason for me to visit Burger King again. nSave yourself the pain and go across the street to Wendy's because this Burger King the food is usually cold, and often incorrect.",1
"My parents lived in Vegas for awhile and introduced me to this FANTASTIC sandwich place. Now every time I am anywhere near a Capriotti's, I have to go. I absolutely love the ""real "", Thanksgiving style turkey on it! No compressed mystery turkeyloaf here! The cheesesteaks are excellent too, just avoid the hot peppers unless you have a hankering to burn off a few of your tastebuds. YUM!",2
"Holy shit, this place is godawful. I deserve it though for not checking reviews. I'm standing on a line to check in right now. It's been 45 fucking minutes and I'm a little more than halfway through the line. AT 1 IN THE MORNING! Can't wait to see shithole of a room. Hoping I don't catch something. Will never do this again.",1
"They are under staffed so don't expect decent service during lunchtime. Sandwiches are not made in order, so don't be surprised if customers who arrive after you get their food first, even if it's the exact same sandwich. They seems to prepare them io particular order and don't communicate with one another to identify who arrived first. Highly disorganized.",1
"I ordered the chicken schwarma, hummus, falafel salad plate. The chicken schwarma was tender and had a good flavor. Hummus was okay and the falafel was a bit too salty. I paid 18 for this dinner which I think is way over priced for what it is. I'm also questioning the handling of the food. The cashier picked up my falafel with his bare hands and threw it in my to go box .",1
"I did this hike for the first time this morning, this was the last mountain in the Valley for me to hike. Wanted to catch the sunrise, so we started around 6 30, and arrived at the summit around 7 10ish which was perfect timing for the sunrise. Very steep at some parts, but well worth the scenic views at the top.",2
"The food was pretty good, only small downside was the service, but that's probably because they were pretty steadily busy the entire time. The margaritas were delicious and strong. The dining area is on the small side but really gives the restaurant character. Overall a good experience and we'll be heading back there.",2
"Do it right. Buy your books online not the international editions and sell them back at this bookstore, early. That way you can get a better price. I've made money at this bookstore on books, buy buying online and selling back to them. Of course there are the times you have to suck it up and buy the teacher's looseleaf binder edition books.",2
"Really good pizza. Not the best in the world, and it can be a little pricey. But it's nice to chill here with friends, have a beer, and go next door to smoke hookah. They also sell pipes and smoking paraphernalia. If you are bored on a sunday night it's a nice place to hang. nPS Beware the tweekers that like to haunt around the parking lot at night But then again, that's all of Phoenix, right?",2
"STOP ! unless you are into drugs drinking staying up all night do not think of living here. do you like to smell mold and watch bugs all the time, this place is for you. if you like to sneak around in the shadows so does the mgmt. don't worry when you go out the mgmt. will keep an eye out inside out! if you enjoy gambling this is the place! ENJOY",1
"Second time here and it keeps getting better! First, the service is outstanding, our needs were anticipated at every point. The salads were fresh with just the right amount of dressing. The linguini and clams had the perfect amount of sauce and spice, pasta was to the tooth. Highly recommend and a must every time we visit Vegas.",2
"The food is very inconsistent when it comes to quality. The orange chicken, fried rice, and cheesecake was pretty good. The lemonade is super sugary, overall, everything ive eaten has resulted in a stomachache. The service was great, very friendly, but untill the quality is better I will not be coming back.",1
Went to go have a nice dinner with my husband before we went to the movies. It was 7 44 when we walked up to the door and were yelled that they were closed very rudely by the manager. We asked what time they closed he replied 8. We brought it to his attention that is was before 8. He said he didn't care And we couldn't eat. I have never been treated so rude before.,1
"Thai lettuce wrap is bomb.com! It's like your own little build your own lettuce wrap station. Cheesecake wise, the red velvet cheesecake is delicious. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I do recommend sharing the slice of cheesecake because the slices are good size but a little too sweet to finish it on your own. I think it's a cute place to have a date",2
"Holy cow, these Pupusas were great! I had two and two pork carnitas tacos. Some of the best Mexican food I've had here in Las Vegas. There was no one in the joint when we arrived, which was fine with me. It was a Saturday early afternoon. The menu is sizable but I knew what I wanted. The food came out pretty fast and it was everything I thought it would be. I can't wait to back to this place!",2
"This restaurant located below the first floor at the Four Queens is kinda pricy , but worth it , especially if you hit a jackpot, or even if you don't.the meals are 5 course.I had the Ribeye and Shrimp Cocktail, appetizer , Hugo's Table Side Salad, and the Bananas Foster.all meals are started with Sherbet to get those taste buds going.and after you eat, you can hit that slot machine again.",2
"This place rocks. Break out of your Pad Thai rut and order Northern specialties like the Kao Tod appetizer spicy sour sausage salad, and the whole catfish, charcoal grilled. Ask for the two sauces, chili lime and tamarind. Order a glass of Riesling from their extensive collection. You'll be glad you did.",2
I called late in the day with a small issue the engine under covers in my Toyota had come loose and were flapping as I drove. They had me come in before they closed and they took the damaged ones off. No Charge! Will gave me advice on what part to get and Dias to just come back when the parts come in. Then he sent me on my way with a smile. The Yelp reviews are right Honest Mechanics Found Here!,2
"Wait time is ridiculous. There is no excuse to take 50 minutes to get a pita to a customer. We were not informed of any wait when we ordered. I watched the line extend out the door multiple times, then an employee would tell the people about the long wait and they would all leave. The place lost hundreds of dollars in revenue in the hour I was waiting there. Fries were ice cold.",1
"Ate here over some of the crepe places on the main strip of old montreal and happy we did! We had the whole place to ourselves, though it isn't that big. The crepes are delicious and innovative and come with fries, a salad, or half fries half salad as an added bonus! A friend had the soup, which was also delicious. Waitstaff was friendly, but quiet. Just a walk down from Notre Dame!",2
I usually judge an eggplant parm compared to the frozen store bought kind. Well unfortunately this didn't pass the test.the customer service was average there were a million staff running around but it took the whole dinner to refill my water and the free garlic knots were very yummy. We used the 1 2 off deal and it worked to cure our hunger but not our need for good italian.,1
"Staff was proud to not acknowledge us. We sat at a table in the bar a dirty one at that and waited for close to 10 min before walking out. When we were leaving we asked the bartender "" Are you proud we are leaving? "" She smiled and said ""yes "". I guess if you are not a regular, you are not welcome. If I could have given it zero stars if that were an option.",1
I absolutely LOVE this place! AMAZING bruschetta! Fantastic wine! The atmosphere is great! Indoor an outdoor seating that is comfortable! They even have outdoor heaters to make it even more enjoyable during the cold months! Try the vanilla creme br u00fbl u00e9e too. Just Amazeballs! I will be back!,2
"Uh.you all are kidding, right? I must have missed something when I visited Fez, as I was very underwhelmed. True, it's very cosmopolitan and the atmosphere is very cool but to me the food was lackluster at best. A restaurant with mediocre food is a mediocre restaurant. nMaybe I'll just have to stick to drinkin' next time ",1
This place has went down hill. Bartenders are rude have they know nothing about customer service. Also the clientele are a bunch of thugs. I would stay away from this place unless your looking for drama. The guy I was sitting by was telling me about how he just got out of jail the night before. Unsafe place!,1
"I used to come here a lot back in the day and I always remembered it to be decent. There is a large variety of choice on the menu, the portions are large, food tastes good, and prices are fine! Nothing to write home about but basically a nice place to go to when you have no food at home and need a quick and satisfying meal!",2
This place was disgusting to say the least. Everything had a very off taste to it like it was spoiled stale. The rice looked a day or 2 old. We took one bite of the food and our server crushed a roach right next to our booth. Yep that was it we paid and left and went and got a burger else where. This only got a 1 star rating because I can't rate it a 0!,1
"Terry and Brandon came out to address a problem today that was left by a previous company they refused to come back out . They were completely professional, kind and took our concerns very seriously. King fixed the problem and made sure we were satisfied, telling us they would come back out if we had any further concerns. I look forward to using them again.",2
"Best wood burning gourmet pizza ever! We loved it and our kids loved it! Fresh ingredient and the crust is cooked to perfection, not too thin and too deep. We spoke to the chef and he is super nice and friendly and it was really quick! Love the little restaurant but it is small and it gets packed during dinner time. Lunch was great and their lunch prices can't be beat!",2
"If I'm going to pay 3 4 for a bagel and 1 for each tiny packet of cream cheese, the bagels should be freakin' toasted. What a waste of a jalapeno cheddar bagel! Damn. It would've been so good if it was warm and toasted. ""Oh, but they're fresh. "" Fresh my ass. Maybe they were, but after sitting in that refrigerated display case, they were cold and somewhat hard.",1
We are here every Wednesday. The service is usually good but tonight it was not. Our appetizer came after we finished our meal and when we asked for more bread earlier the waiter joked about how there is a one loaf per table rule. I guess he meant it because we never got another loaf. Well the joke is on him when he does not get a tip! I guess we won't be back anytime too soon.,1
"Food horrid, service was ok. Even though it was comped from my play at PT's I wouldn't eat here again. I was told that they make everything, yeah right out of a can it was horrible and for 9.00 you can get something out of a can for 0.50 that would taste better at Smith's just down the street. Oh well lesson learned.",1
"They had a stall at the convention center. Awful is an understatement. I only went there because they had vegetarian food, but the rice was undercooked, the vegetables were overcooked and the Dal was not cooked and smelled burnt. Yikes! Next time, I will rely on Kind Bars rather than go here. Really bad.",1
"This location just opened where the Island's Burger used to be by Raintree and the 101. They deserve an above average rating for the great service. They were well staffed with people who knew what they were doing and wanted very much to please. The pizza's not Bianco's, but it's good, and there's a lot to be said for being well taken care of without any bs.",2
"Wow this is NOT the best in towor are they ""same day service "" as advertised! Went to pick up my husbands shirts the next day and they still weren't ready. They said they would deliver them to our hotel later that day but nope they did not do that either! And when we went to pick them up His shirts were missing! Won't use these guys again, ever",1
"Rented a tuxedo for the MMA awards. They were Friday, and I went in on Monday, it was no problem at all, and they were extremely friendly and helpful. The workers remembered me, and asked how the awards were, and told me that they keep measurements, in case I need future rentals. Excellent quality stuff, even last minute, and they've got tons of options! They are excellent.",2
"this place is pure disgrace to chinese food, 13.95 for the two choice bbq and its not even good at all, it come on a 5 inch oval plate. food are super oily. bill come out to 46 for 3 dishes when they are located in springmtn. never coming back again. it was a shame to be called sam woo bbq restaurant.",1
"I usually love America's Taco Shop but this location is terrible. My 8 burrito was the size of a taquito and taste bland. It taste like nothing. Usually the Carne Asada burrito is huge and incredibly flavorful. So disappointed since I live right next to it. Stay away. Go to the other locations, they are actually great.",1
"This food was absolutely delicious. I ordered udon and my two friends both ordered ramen. We all thought it was very tasty. Honestly I will be dreaming about it until I come again. My only complaint is its a little pricey for my budget but definitely worth it. Also, so pleased to find the heated fancy toilet in the women's bathroom. This certainly elevated my experience.",2
"They have a pretty wide menu, but it's generally a more unhealthy fare, such as the deep fried Italian hoagie. The turkey burger is pretty good. Portion size is good, and it's more likely you'll leave stuffed than hungry. Service is horrible. We waited 40 minutes for food and they weren't even that busy.",1
"Came here for dinner. Fantastic food, superb service, great space! They happily accommodated my nut allergy by helping me navigate the menu and communicated with me about food preparation this level of service was so greatly appreciated. EVERYTHING we had was delicious some of our favorites are listed below Citrus Marinated Calamari nLobster Arancini nSpaghetti nVeal Chop Saltimbocca nTiramisu",2
Huge fan of Royal! I have been to both the Royal bar at Union and storefront in the Biltmore. Love their lattes either hot or cold. I prefer the Union location just because of the seating outside is nicer than the other location at the Biltmore. Either location will give you great customer service and excellent coffee creations.,2
I thoroughly enjoyed the.meal and atmosphere. The wait service was friendly and responsive. The angus burger was juicy and flavorful. The patty was thick and well formed. But it didn't taste overly dense that Ive come to expect from other restaurants. The onion rings were crunchy and flavorful. Great job. I look forward to my next trip to Vegas.,2
"I love bread. I love pastries. Mirabelle supplies those both in short order and they're' delicious, although a bit pricey. That's fine, they're worth it when it's the weekend after getting my stipend and some high falootin', gussied up pastry seems appropriate on a Saturday morning. Who says grad students don't have fun? In all seriousness, it's a quality local bakery and well worth it.",2
"I love their regular menu, but their Sunday Brunch is the reason I head to Sierra Bonita. My favorite is the Buttermilk Chicken if its a regular night. If you go for brunch, please try the Atole Pinon Hotcakes. You will not be disappointed. They have a great sweetness without being overpowering. Perfect!",2
"Both my wife and I ordered burgers. I had the pesto burger as seen on triple d and she had the cheeseburger with saut u00e9ed onions. I had the onion rings and she had the garlic fries. To be honest I expected more from the burger that was featured, it was ok, I was not blown away by it. However, the onion rings and fries were the bomb! My wife enjoyed her burger as well. Will return for sure.",2
"ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS IN VEGAS ! Amazing, great effects, awesome theater ,the most breathtaking performances! Wow WOW WOW ! Our tickets came with a vacation package so our seats were the very top row but we still enjoyed the show. We sat in the front middle before. One of those shows that I think you will be AMAZED no matter where you sit !",2
This place sucks I paid for 160 to equal 200 for most of there resturants and I called down the day I checked out to make sure I wasn't over and they told me I had 17.82 left and then when I checked out they then told me I had a balance of 236.00 that I owed them don't stay hear they are liers and thieves,1
"Abundance of trails for a variety of skill levels. The per vehicle charge is 6 and they only take cash so be sure to bring with you. The park's house are reasonable and the staff is great! Have been out here many times to hike, take guided tours with the rangers, and more. Its a fun, cheap, and a great way to wear out the kids in a beautiful setting.",2
"This place was very good. They played sweet 80's music the whole time, which was awesome, and the service was perfect. We ordered Pad Thai and Masman Curry w tofu and they were both fantastic. We did order both dishes a 4 out of 10 spicy and it was a bit too hot. Probably would pick 2 or 3 next time. Would totally recommend this place.",2
"It's a deli that puts coleslaw and fries in a sandwich. The sandwich was OK.nothing fantastic but not horrible either. However, I fail to see why this place was featured on a number of food shows as one of the best sandwich places in America. Basically, as with many of the places on TV shows, the hype and reputation are actually better than the actual food.",1
"Very very bad. First of all, the service is bad. We had to go inside and find our waitress ourselves, and everything is slow. The food is also not good, the burger meat patty taste bad, and the bread bun is bad, and I don't like they put blue cheese in the burger, it ruins everything. And with such bad service and bad food, they expect at least 15 tips. Worst pub I ever been to.",1
"I also wish I could give 0 stars. I've had two packages delivered to the wrong address in less than one week. I can understand an accident once, but twice is just plain imcompetent. I still have not received either package. Customer services says they will have the driver help me find the packaged, but that hasn't happened either. Avoid using them at all cost.",1
"I was referred to this shop about 2 months ago. Visit 1.replace watch battery. Very nice shop. pleasant and helpful employees. Atmosphere of a customer oriented small business. Trip 2. Needed to fix a clasp on a bracelet. Great service, very little time and now I know where to go when I have ""bigger "" problems with my other watches in the future. Recommend highly to anyone",2
I have been going to this gym for a few years now. All the employees there are very friendly and helpful. The classes are great and very effective. Some of the equipment is a little bit older but everything works. The equipment works and is always clean. I recommend taking the body pump or the spin classes. But make sure you get a pass before class. It doesn't fill up too fast.,2
"Been seeing Chiropractors since before they were allowed to hang their sign up. Dr. Vu is what chiropractic care was meant to be. No lengthy and expensive programs. He was able to treat me one time and take care of the problem without x rays. I will go back one more time for another look and to thank him. There may be Chiropractors as good in the area, but none better.",2
"I'd like to give a huge shout out to William at this location! I am not in often, but when I am, he never fails to greet me with a smile and nice conversation while ringing me out. Recently, I bought a Christmas tree and he happily wheeled it to my car, and placed it in my trunk cautiously, avoiding getting any scrapes or dust from the box on my interior. Great job William! He's the best!",2
"Saw this on DDD and tracked it down. Website said nothng about being closed thru March 27 stinks that I went to the trouble of finding this place and the location is easier to miss than you might think only to find out that they were closed. Looked good on TV, but it seemed a little dirty up close. Still.wanted to give it a whirl",1
"Very disappointing experience. I ordered seared tuna and it was still almost frozen in the middle ! I've had seared Tuna in many other restaurants and this is the first bad experience I've ever had. I hardly ever send a meal back to the kitchen, however I did send this one back. It was much better the 2nd time, but I don't think I will be back. I give the staff 5 stars, but the food only earned 2.",1
"I really hate to give them 2 stars since the couple who owns Mashisoyo is so sweet but our most recent take out order just was not up to par. When I opened my sundubu container it seemed like it was only half filled. Did the potion size go down?!?!? Also, my man's yukhaejang was sooooooooo spicy that it was hard for him to enjoy it with all of the coughing he was doing.",1
"Great place lots of options for pedicures all include mini massages and scrubs and everyone is very nice. One girl actually recommend some nail colors I didn't consider before but it turned out great and still within the theme I wanted. Mainly tho I come for the pedis they have citrus, pumpkin, yogurt, and a milk and honey one to name a few they all sound so luxurious! Definitely recommend",2
My mother in law just purchased a couch on discount from this location. The couch is beautiful. Or was. While we were moving it into my truck the men helping us Jeremy and theo ripped and scratched the material then walked away with out even as much as a sorry or offer to replace and or fix the couch. I am VERY disappointed in this experience and will not be back.,1
"I've always enjoyed my meal here but my dinner tonight really REALLY made my mouth happy! I had a small plate of 3 lamb chops crusted with a curry and spices on top of a bed of cabbage. For dessert, creme brulee IN individual strawberrys! My dinner partner had a small plate of crab cakes and she also ordered the same dessert. Both plates were so yummy!",2
"Nice people, however, very overpriced. First hour is like 130.00 and then they charge you every 15 min. It seems like 100.00 an hour, for just some things done around the house. This is not worth the money. Also, they can't even do everything you need, so they refer a lot out to other contractors. There are only a couple of handymen that work and the experience is not what they say it is.",1
"Ate here for the first time and my experience was not so good. I had high expectations due to the reviews but I must say, the food was mediocre and the service the same. Turkey sausage was disgusting my buddies brkfst burrito was dry. Will not return. It's over rated and over priced. Save yourself the time and obey, go to the cracked egg or egg works.",1
"I am very impressed with the quality of the fish here! When a person has enough sushi, they get to recognize, and appreciate, a chef who delivers fine fish. I don't live in Phoenix, but if I did, I'd be a regular! The restaurant was very clean and neat when I went, and it was nice to see that the staff was a family. The Dynamite roll is delicious!",2
"Pizza, Pasta, great people, great food, and the ""Shwings "", Sabatino's is one NOT to be missed! Kevin Sherry are great people owners and do a great job, have quality in their food which you certainly can taste! Maybe Michael L was having a bad day. never had that issue after eating but things do happen. ",2
"As an interior designer, I ofteeed an electrician that I can trust will do the job right the first time. He always replies promptly to new requests, his prices are fair and he is licensed making sure all jobs are completed to code. He is extremely knowledgeable and personable with a great sense of humor. I can confidently refer him to clients knowing he will look out for their best interests!",2
"Tried this place out looking for something different. we got it. There seems to be a shortage of salt and seasoning here. Everything was bland and forgetful. They need bigger glasses also. It's like a kids cup of drink. Over all it was a hot meal, the server was nice and sweet, and the ranch was really good but the food was not everything we had hoped for. We probably won't be returning.",1
The food here is good down home cooking and the service here is normally good and efficient I have to kick this place up a star the food is pretty dang good eggs bene although I order two eggs poached which come out perfect every time a slice of ham English muffin and a side of holandase sauce and make my own bene pancakes waffles all good as well,2
"Paid a decent rate 79 for a suite each night over the weekend, but after the kids swam in the pool and in the hot tub over the weekend, they all got sick with 'Hot Tub Rash'. Tried to contact the hotel management and they would not call me back after multiple attempts. Continental breakfast was good, but avoid the pool!",1
"Hugo Vino at Cycle was an amazing experience. Where to begin, but with the starters. The roasted beet salad was excellent, as was the bruscetta. The short rib was so good, I can't stop wishing for more! The shrimp was really good, too. And dessert, yum! Goat cheese cheesecake OMG! and strawberries with marscapone cheese, light and delicious. We are praying Hugo Vino returns REALLY SOON!",2
"Great dinner. The crab cake appetizer were probably the best I've ever had. Ordered their short rib plate. It was good and tasty but not great. The mashed potatoes that it came with were really good though. Also, we had great service. Might go again, except that it's pricey. GF had their duck flatbread. I didn't like it much, but she really liked it.",2
"Sorry guys, I just wasn't impressed with Long Wongs. Dude and I were feeling like wings one evening after bowling, so we decided to stop in here and get some to go and see what the big whoop was. We tried the Hot and Suicide flavors. The wing sauces were way too salty, vinegary, and the wings were pretty bare meat wise. Meh, I've experienced better indeed sums it up.",1
"Food was superb, I had the diver scallops, not the best I've had, but still very very tasty. My wife had the mushroom ravioli with oxtail, excellent. Fried rice was simple but also tasty. Service was attentive and friendly. Down sides, a little small, so make a reservation and pricey. I also like bigger scallops.",2
"Men,women, junior, children infant clothes and shoes for all.ALL NAME BRAND quality stuff! This place is AWESOME! Receipt 2 pairs of junior jeans, leather belt, 2 blouses, 7 YES, 7! bras, 4 mens shirts, set of 8 silver hoops and studs earrings, a group of silver bangle bracelets, 2 amazing candle sets.Total 109.00! nThe girls working there are super friendly and helpful.Will defianetly be back!",2
"A worthwhile stop for toy collectors, enthusiasts and the curious. Jam packed with vintage and new collectable toys. Its a fun store to browse and leave with something you didnt know you needed! Shops like this, with a passionate owner are exactly the stores I like to shop in and support! I'll go everytime we are in Vegas.",2
"I don't have a lot to say about this place. nSushi was okay. They put way too much sauce on the rolls and the rolls themselves are monotone in taste. Nothing spectacular, but nothing utterly disgusting at the same time. Would I recommend this place? Probably not. There are better sushi place around the area.",1
Fantastic show! It was my favorite show I've seen in Vegas. You need to appreciate raunchy humor to enjoy this show. There was a little of everything. The reviews I read on yelp were very true to form. Don't go to this show if your at all up tight. Acts are daring and a little scary since your so close to the stage. Loved it.,2
I'm addicted to HomeGoods! nCame here last week for the first time and found a bunch of awesome pieces for my bedroom and dog. nCame back again today and found more great finds! nMy favorite place to shop for house items! nI may be tempted to come back every week until I get my fix! nHomegoods you got me good! n dog friendly! Love bringing my puppy with me! nI'm a super fan! n Miss Yelp 2012,2
"This place is fantastic. I work at a nearby church and they are always willing to cater our events. Their pizza is mouth watering good, and their pasta dishes are always delicious and fresh. Portions are hefty and their staff is always friendly. Much more personable and less commercial than Olive Garden. Definitely recommended!",2
"Won't be back. Food was only fair. Gravy appears to be from a mix, no flavor, and the sausage patty reminded me of what you get at a fast food place, only much greasier. While the hashbrowns were plentiful, they were only crisp on one side. Coffee was on the weak side and quickly became lukewarm. Very disappointed.",1
"Went here while on a trip to Montreal. The escargot was wonderful, the lamb chops delicious and the steak decent. Hard to mess a lot of this stuff up. Our waiter was very lovely, though. I would go there again if I wanted to splurge. The decor was very nice, but cluttered with flags and other strange things. They can't have lasted 40 years without some decent eats, that's for sure.",2
"I have been a loyal client of Ashton Duffy's for over two years. She's the absolute best. She is amazing with color and always does a fantastic job. It always brightens my day to see her and have her do my hair, and she takes extra time to style it like you want and even teach you new tricks and tips on how to style it. I will be forever loyal to Ashton!",2
"Great bar for happy hour even though they reduced the number of offerings on it like no pizza. Hint hint, your competitors offer it. Restaurant side is good but service is not always the best. always seems to be a lot of talk going on between the manager and others vs serving the tables which I see seems to be a common complaint about service.",2
"Dass ich jemals ein Franchise Fastfood Restaurant gut finden w u00fcrde, h u00e4tte ich nicht gedacht. Ich muss mich ja sogar korrigieren Fast Food kann man das n u00e4mlich nicht nennen Qualitativ hochwertige Speisen wie Wraps, Salate, Smoothies zu fairen Preisen gro u00dfe Salate etwa 7EUR wirklich empfehlenswert f u00fcr eine kurzfristige Mahlzeit hierher zu kommen.",2
"I was excited to find a place with such great reviews. All I can say, It was terrible! I waited 20 minutes and the entire experience was just odd. The message was horrible and I swear some of the tactics they use can't be healthy for your body. I was worried they were going to pull my shoulder out and that I would be bruised in several areas.",1
"I've eaten here more times than I can count, and have yet to have a negative experience. The food is great, and the staff is extremely friendly. My favorite menu items include crab puppies, white bean hummus plate, ding dong chicken sandwich, and buffalo shrimp tacos. Their cocktail menu is definitely work checking out, too lots of fun drinks to try.",2
Some of the most disinterested employees of all time Bought a ticket to strip hotel and after waiting 20 minutes bus came and I asked the driver if he was going to my hotel just to be sure I was in correct line and he refused to answer me and stared and shrugged his shoulders. I took a cab nI am surprised these folks are still in business.,1
"Food was fantastic but don't expect to order off the menu. Just ask for whatever they want to serve you. No soap in the bathroom, they said they were ordering a new soap dispenser. nMost items were fried. The rice beans mix was dry and bland. It feels like you're traveling in a third world country. First world prices. nMy new favorite spot!",2
"Do not order delivery! Ridiculous! They sent out menus to I'm assuming nearby areas 2 wks ago. We decided to try, they don't understand english! And they got upset and switch callers on me all speak broken English to correct the order! It's as simple as removing 1 item that we didn't order but they charged! Then the prices on the newly mailed out menus are a dollar or 2 off!",1
"Grand opening on Labor Day weekend. Friday night Kobe Bryant was there with a bunch of other guys like Baron Davis and kinda random Marcus Allen. Good crowd. Size is the same as Lure used to be but looks a bit more open as they knocked down some walls. I always liked Lure so Blush works well if you want to party in a slightly smaller, more intimate venue.",2
"I love steaks and mine here was the second best I have ever had. I had the free ranch rib eye well done. And it was cooked perfectly. The inside looks like a Steak House should, all dark and full of wood. The service was amazing. They work in teams and are always there when you need a dink or anything else. The only downside is the sides are pretty small.",2
"Ein gutes griechisches Restaurant. Der u00fcberaus nette Besitzer produziert sein eigenes Oliven u00f6l, wirklich toll. Hier wird mit frischen Produkten gearbeitet. Die Weine sind auch sehr gut also Preis Leistung Verh u00e4ltnis stimmt absolut. Nur leider ist es etwas weit ab vom Schuss und das Restaurant recht kahl eingerichtet. Das k u00f6nnte man wirklich bisschen gem u00fctlicher machen.",2
Whenever in vegas buffets a must. I only come here when childrens are with our party and we usually just hop on for the frozen hot chocolate here. Its worth sharing. The other items we usually order is the appetizers which is ok not the best. I never got the chance to try the main entrees here. It is overpriced and personally rather do the buffet in ceasars.,2
"I was craving donuts, and decided to stop in for a couple. The woman helping me seemed miserable. I ordered one chocolate frosted, and one vanilla frosted. They were both put in a bag on their side without any paper which caused most of the icing to come off onto the bag. The donuts are delicious, but they lack customer service.",1
I used to go to Lees pretty frequently but now only rarely when all other places are closed. The owner or manager posts signs supporting political candidates I do not support. I don't go to a business to find out the owner's political opinion. I don't want to feel like buying a bottle of wine means I'm helping some rightwing hater crackpot get elected.,1
"Always fast but most importantly they are always honest with you. Their prices are very fair and they always want to show you the old part that was bad. The entire team there is great and very knowledgable. If you need anything done to your vehicle I would highly recommend taking it to Gabs, you won't be disappointed!",2
"Omg. I ordered an xl Hawaiian Pizza. Delivery was fast. I opened the pizza box and saw the thinnest pizza I ever saw in my life. There were 11 pieces of sliced ham, not Canadian bacon on it. There were 14 small chunks of pineapple. Skimpy. The pizza was floppy. I will never ever order from here again. I will go to sams club. Blaaaaaaah.",1
"Saw this gem on diners drive ins and dives. Everything lived up to its hype except my medium sasquatch ended up being well done. nWe had the white cheddar cheese curds, their house wheat and a sasquatch. This was enough to feed 3 grown ladies! n 1 for the waitress. She was more consumed with the boys at the bar then her tables.",2
"Probably the worst PTs in Vegas. We had 1 drink and left. The bartender never checked up on us until it was time for us to close our tab. I'm in the service industry and found the customer service to be lacking terribly. I will never return. Spitting in a ""dip cup "" behind the bar is absolutely disgusting btw. My group was mortified ",1
Have been here three times due to convenience. Unfortunately convenience does not translate into good food or service. Slow slow slow and the food was not worth the wait. What made it worse last time was watching everyone enjoying their food next door at Otto so much and also knowing that B B was right beneath us. Third time was not a charm and I will not be going back.,1
"Our group of five wanted a classic American breakfast. This place delivered. We decided to eat outside on the patio , this was not a hassle for anyone. Service was great and everyone had coffee that was full at all times. I had the 2x2x2 which was there 2 pancakes 2 eggs and 2 bacon . Fluffy pancakes what more can a man ask for with warm syrup. Win.",2
"The atmosphere is trendy, hipster and young professional type feel. The food is decent with gourmet selections A little more of the pricey side of food but you'll definitely enjoy the selections. The service is a bit off. I waited for water a lot and transition between dishes wasn't really a team effort but overall the experiences I've had have been positive!",2
This place has been around for years. And I have been going for that many years! BEST HAWAIIAN FOOD I've tasted here in Vegas. Staff is SUPER FRIENDLY! As are All Hawaiians! Lol. But Loco Moco is AMAZING! Spam Eggs and Rice breakfast is yummy! Get lumpia. Adobo fried rice omelette is amazing. TRULY anything and everything you get you will love!,2
" 20 for a fuzzy navel? Is that bartender code for ""please don't come back ""? The only reason he got my money is because i thought i was paying for my friends's drink also. I found out differently when we got back to our table. I saw plenty of reviews about cheap drinks. Either we don't live on the same planet or i got taken advantage of.",1
"I came iot expecting much but was extremely pleased with the result. After a fumbled attempt at explaining to the stylist what I wanted she seemed to understand right away and went right to work. How many times after a cut can you say that you can go home and recreate the style, but I did! Thank you Cassnandra, you're the best!",2
these guys are the greatest. i've seen their show both off broadway and at the luxor and also the how to be a megastar tour in san jose. i don't want to spoil the fun by going into details about the show. all i can say is that you can expect a stunning performance to satisfy your visual and auditory pleasure. i guarantee it.,2
"Best place to go to in Vegas for tacos! Especially when you're hungry after a night out clubbing drinking. it's on the strip and located right next to Encore, so if the taxi line is super long, I suggest you try some Taco El Gordo! The tacos are cheap 2! It might take awhile for the food to come out since everyone goes there late after a night out clubbing, but it's worth the wait.",2
"Used to love this place, but the last four items I bought there had to be returned due to defects, and they sold me rotten frozen anchovies that disintegrated in my hand when we tried to use them fishing and stunk to high heaven so badly I smelled them on my hands for an entire day afterward. Seems they're resting on faulty laurels lately. I'm terribly disappointed.",1
"Cute atmosphere. We started off with the sliders and sad to say the little miny buns were hard as a ROCK!. Wine is served in stemless glasses which is a NO NO. Ordered the passion fruit creme brulee and it was ok. Overall, a 3 for OK. Wasn't wowed, but may give them a second chance. Sorry to do this, but I have to go with a 2 star for this place. Over rated.",1
Such a wonderful company with great products! I bought the cutest repurposed necklace there for a friend as a gift. When I flew home the airport crushed my bag and broke nearly everything I had purchased including the necklace . Jordan from BluMarble was very helpful in helping me purchase a new one and free shipping. GREAT customer service!,2
I really enjoyed the owners and family and learned a lot about them. Their food is just what queen creek needs real food and nothing was bad at all. They're right on Ocotillo and easy to pull off quick to eat. I'm full and satisfied and ready for more. It was my first time eating collard greens and they were very good. The menu is a decent size and they are accommodating.,2
"There is much to like here. The lanes are well cared for, the staff is always quick to help and the environment is enjoyable for having a good time. I've bowling in a league here for almost two years and everyone here does a great job helping out. Food is good, music is good and the prices are right. What's not to love?",2
"A reservation means nothing, we had a convertible reserved, showed up and no car available. An hour and a half later we got a car that had a dirty interior. Hey thanks for giving us a great start to our vacation! On the plus side the woman at the counter was super nice, if this is about her it would be 5 star.",1
One of our family's favorite choices for pizza.staff has always been very friendly and helpful at this location even when we have to customize their specialty pizzas for the kids. Over the summer we have also tried their s'mores pizza and it was a big hit. Our favorite right now is the Herb Chicken Mediterranean.would definitely recommend giving it a try.,2
"My friend recommended me here about 6 months ago and all I can say is wow. nI've lived in Vegas for 2 1 2 years and its the only place I can get the cut I want. The fade is perfect and the service is fantastic. Always looking forward to a fresh cut. nI've seen all the barbers do some real clean cuts. Looking for a barber? nDon't go to a ghetto shop, go here!",2
"Good sushi! Jason is a great sushi chef and always prepares amazing sushi. However, dont be surprised if you are asked to move seats after you have paid. This is money city, and they have no problem clearing you out if others are waiting. Even if you are still finishing your last drink. Be prepared for rude.",1
"If you have a Sushi craving stop here and squash it. Its like 26 for all you can eat. You have to finish everything you order, but man we eat so much Sushi I will not need to see Sushi for the rest of the year. Well maybe in a month or 2 I could enjoy some Sushi again. Eveything tasted great and we all enjoyed it. A party of 15 and everyone liked the place so I will be back ",2
Got a BYOB cheeseburger that was awesome. We sat at the outside bar and realized the place was swarming with flies. I mean they were everywhere! Place was busy but hopelessly understaffed. All the staff were great but having only one bartender who also was running food just made no sense. Food was great but flies were disgusting.,1
"How do you rate a place that has been so bad for so long. High prices for mediocre pizza and long wait times to boot. They just raised their already high prices even higher. Lack of any care at all from the people taking the order to making you wait ""cause its coming right up "" for more than 20 additional minutes as they find your order and make it in front of you. Nope.never again.",1
"Best Sunday Brunch in the city. We love the Sunday Brunch here. The food is top notch and the staff is always polite. We have also gone for dinner a few times. The grand concourse is not cheap but the ambiance alone is worth it. We like the place so much we got married here, which worked out great for pictures.",2
"This theater is typically not as clean or comfortable as other Regal Cinemas located at other station casinos. Specifically, I nearly always have a better movie watching experience at Sunset Station or Green Valley Ranch. The employees are friendly at Boulder, and it's entrance is right near the parking garage exit, so that's nice to not have to walk through a smoky casino to get to the theater.",1
"Best Tavern in the valley. Wonderful food, great staff and management and fun crowds. Kid friendly if it's a family night and an even better happy hour dinner spot for the adults. They make you feel at home everytime you visit. My family gets to AT any chance we get. Love the place. Tracy always pays us a visit we come in nice touch and sign of appreciation. Great job AT!",2
"So the place has Christmas lights, and a fair amount of ambiance, and supposedly there's a shirtless shot at 1 00 which might make going back worth it. Other than that, the service was less than lackluster, the domestic kegs all seemed flat. In other words, go somewhere else unless it's 1 00 and you want to see some daytime nudity.",1
"Excellent gluten free sandwiches and garlic bread! About to try the pizza! nPizza was great! I always find myself wanting a thicker Gluten Free pizza crust but at least I can order a good pizza. I had the ""meatsa "" pizza I believe it was called it was great with the Roast beef on it. Very happy camper referred a friend the other day.",2
"I really wanna tear into this place, but long story short, if you want to go to a Strip Club with both Male and Female dancers, this place is that. Not much else. Tip Before you buy a lap dance, make sure you watch them dance for a bit beforehand, as there are some serious discrepancies in talent, ranging from a Cirque du Soleil reject that's a compliment, by the way to an actual turrets sufferer.",1
"I like the El Cortez, because they cater to old, fat, worn out farts like me. Ain't too many places left in this town where a guy can take a 20 bill and play nickel poker for a couple of hours. What's not to love? They have even improved the ventilation and I didn't get a case of early lung cancer from second hand smoke today. Way to go El Cortez, keep that old time Vegas thing of yours going.",2
"Not all Ruth Chris Steakhouses are the same. The servers are sincere but the food could not match. Day old bread, croutons from the box, microwaved potato, steak that was not only full of ribbons of fat but cooked to the point that it would qualify as charcoal. A franchisee that should be kicked out of the system if the parent wants to save its reputation.",1
One of my favorite all you can eat sushi restaurant! They have the best spider roll there! The grilled shrimp skewer was also delicious. The hot items were great as well. Sushi was pretty fresh for being in the desert. Service was excellent always on top on our orders and quick service. Closes late as well.,2
This place is awesome. I really enjoy coming here for some quick Chinese food. If you need something fast and tasty I highly recommend this place. Whenever I need to pick up a mask for the family I just come here to pick stuff up. This place also delivers which is amazing at a charge of two bucks. The only reason for four stars is because the food here can sometimes be slightly oily at times.,2
"I gave this place 2 stars instead of one or zero because I did not get sick after eating there. Although I might have felt better if I had. How can I describe this place. Its truck stop atmosphere combined with poor service, and un fabulous food all served with no love. So sad. I had the nachos which were awful, the french fries were good though. If you have a choice go elsewhere.",1
"I'm not sure about their dinner but I'm convinced that like their breakfast it's delicious.Me,my mom,and sister wanted to grab a satisfying morning meal and we found ourselves at this inviting facility and all of the food we had ordered was cooked to perfection and was quite delightful I recommend this place to anyone who wants to satisfy those good breakfast cravings.",2
Good wine selection but poor quality food and lackluster service. This is my third time here and the second time they did not have the ingredients necessary to prepare the meal I ordered from their menu. That didn't stop them though. They substituted without asking and served me hoping I wouldn't notice.,1
"Was going to subway, but when I parked I saw this place and new it was fate. The staff was very friendly and the kitchen was open so you could actually see them cooking your food. I got my usual crab rangoons and spicy tso's chicken with chow mein. All of it was delicious! Definitely coming back for more.",2
"We have used this cleaner for several years and have always been happy with how our clothes turn out. Great pride and care are taken and it is evident. Service is top notch and the turnaround is very quick. nThey also do alterations, and I can say the same about that as I have above about the dry cleaning.",2
"This is such a beautiful park! I won't reiterate the amenities most of the other reviews have pointed out, but the rec center is really clean and there's a lot of activities inside as well. I have yet to take advantage of their trails and picnic areas, though I will definitely make it a point to do so!",2
"We got a pimp ass new Ford Fusion with the works. Think leather seats, seat warmers, sirius satellite, sun roof, etc. This car was even better than some of the hotels we stayed in while visiting the National Parks in Utah! The service was friendly and quick. Able to pick up and drop off the car with ease, only taking about 15 20 minutes extra out of time from airport terminal to rental center .",2
"Again have had the extreme pleasure of demolishing my food at this wonderful establishment, again got the most expensive thing on the menu A5 wagyu and was superb, maybe 6 or 7th time in the last two years and will be back as many as possible till i pass, food service were on point! We had the waitresses there was only one for a long time both were great, hope to be back real soon!",2
"This place has their food frozen and they deep fry it but it is delicious. I usually get a combo because it gives a variety of different stuff and the combo's are very filling, they give fries with them, too. The food comes with some sauce but any additional tartar or cocktail sauce will cost extra.",2
"Went in for lunch on Friday, the place was empty. It should of been a sign. The food was ok, tasted as if was reheated and served. The noodles were really soggy and the rice was very dry. Didn't think to much of it until I got home, reheated the food and saw a cockroach mixed in with the noddles. Needless to say I will never, ever go back back to that awful place.",1
"5 stars because VOSS is boss, when it comes to his tattoo artist expertise and outstanding service and so much more. Got 2 tattoos here so far September 30, 2013 and back on January 30 . Definitely book your next appointment with him. Biggups! Minimizes the level of pain from the tattoo guns that he uses.",2
"Great buffet! This was my first Vegas Buffet.the bad part is it ruined the others! Excellent selections and very clean. The service was not ""perfect "" but no real issues.maybe most notable is the lack of speed in service. I tried the brunch two mornings in a row, they changed the offerings up, which was perfect. Everything I tried was fresh and cooked well. I caot imagine a better selection.",2
"RUDE STAFF, bartenders were dicks even the girls. and 7 for a mini water bottle? hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Nowhere to sit and ""lounge "". All the ""lounging is for bottle service or your ass is either dancing or standing all night. Ok music. It was uuuuupppp and dooooown. We had to leave after 30 min or so. Never again, unless it was a last resort or im inebriated!",1
"Ehh this buffet isn't really good! Ive have had worse though. Salad bar, prime rib and the peel and eat shrimp we're good. Everything else was mediocre. Not a huge selection of items also but for 15 for dinner I guess I can't complain. I probably won't be back for dinner again but I like to try there breakfast buffet.",1
"Thai food. mmmmhmmmmm, this is one of the better thai restaurants that i've been to in the States. I live in the Bay Area so there is lots of thai food, but coming here to this hole in the wall in the middle of nowhere to eat was a delight. Definitely recommend people to come here, even though it is off the strip.",2
"Took my Toyota Rav 4 for a 60,000 mile service. They told me I needed new front struts and a transmission service for 1,100. I declined and went to the Toyota dealer on Sahara. I did not need EITHER. 230 at dealer for the service. Plus the cashier James Harrison was extremely rude. Rip off! Don't go!",1
I got a burrito here this evening and found a HAIR like an eyebrow size in it as well as a small nat like bug inside the tin foil. I eat chipotle all the time and have NEVER found something like this in my food. I highly suggest this location to be looked at by the health department. I would go to any other location than this one. Absolutely disgusted!,1
"ate here four times in three days on my last weekend trip to vegas, mostly while faded. the place is just so convienent if you're staying at the Venetian or any of the connected hotels. probably the best fries on the strip crispy and super salty and the sloppy joe sandwich is the perfect way to end the night.at 5am.",2
I like the modern rustic feel of this place. I felt relaxed eating at this spot. My husband and I came here to enjoy the Barbeque Chicken salad. It was fantastic! We also tried the Chicken Tortilla soup. It was delightful really stood out from your traditional Chicken Tortilla soup. I am eager to try more things on the menu next time.,2
Tried this place for the first time and I'm honestly impressed. The pizza is HUGE and it taste good and fresh. I got 2 slices and some garlic cheese bread with a drink all for about 9 which is a great deal. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because of the customer service. Staff wasn't very friendly and seemed to enjoy their own convo more than they wanted to work.,2
"Good prices here, and lots of stuff on sale. I got some Fuji apples for only 59 cents a pound unusual for these days. I can't even get them that cheap up in the Northwest, where they are grown. And got delicious semi dried persimmons for only 1.69 a pound that price is hard to beat. If I lived in Las Vegas I'd be shopping here a lot.",2
"Second visit to this wonderful spot! I was worried that my husband would not be as impressed especially with the high prices for drinks , but he even ordered a second round of drinks so we could try different and fun cocktails ! The cocktails, service, and views are amazing. I really, really love this bar! The drinks are unique and amazing. This is a fabulous place to visit in Vegas!",2
"Been here a few times, but my last visit was the best yet. Took my parents out for my dad's bday. The Rebellion Red and Ba Dunkel were incredible. Staff is always very helpful and attentive. I wasn't the biggest fan at the grand opening, but they've really come around with some great beers. Great place for craft brew downtown.",2
"Their ""special "" pie have to be pre ordered and that order has to be in by 2 PM, otherwise, you have to wait two days. Their web site should give you this information, both that the pie has to be specially order and the drop dead time. I stopped by at 2 25 PM and I was to late to get my order in for the next day.",1
Drove down Arville and came across this place . Found out that they have hookah! Found out the guy who makes the hookah used to work at Olive so he knows what he's doing . Hooked up a cool mix for me to try out . Good craft beer selection too! My bartender's name was Krista and she was amazing ! Great personality and great bartender. I will def be back.,2
"They've got an excellent set of rotating Real Ale cask! taps, something different every time you visit. They've got a great selection of burgers including four veggie burgers, and even a haggis burger. Not a lot else in the food department though. The decor is very nice, all dark wood and friendly atmosphere. It's just a shame about the terribly bland and offensively inoffensive coffee shop music.",2
"My favorite hideaway on east Fremont. It's a great place to relax, once you find the door. Depending on your mood, it's a good spot to begin the night or end it. The craft cocktails are delicious and the staff is knowledgeable. A seasonal menu keeps me coming back. It is dark inside, so watch where you step.",2
"You better hope an employee isn't cooking food while you want to pay. Why you ask? Because their wifi shuts off if someone uses the microwave in the break room. This happened to me and it took a bit to get it back up and running. They said it casually, like that's normal. The staff wasn't that helpful overall and the paying issue is just ridiculous.",1
"They really need to work on the service. I used to like eating there when the funny man as the waiter still worked. Their food is fine, not great. I love their sesame balls and used to buy them on a regular basis. However, the new waitress who started working almost a few months now, made me reluctant to eat there. She is very rude! I miss the funny guy!",1
"This would have been a perfectly mediocre chain Italian restaurant meal, if it hadn't been for the 36 hours of food poisoning I suffered through following my meal there. It made the day long business meeting I had after my meal there all the more interesting.having to sit by the door so I could quickly run to the bathroom to throw up. Thanks so much!",1
This is my favourite place to stay in the city and a great place to eat. The food is well above average and the staff are really friendly. They made excellent suggestions and did specials that changed through the evening. Lively atmosphere even on a Sunday night and the cocktails are fantastic. The breakfasts are huge and tasty. Great stuff.,2
I don't why this hotel is rated high. It's a Pathetic restaurant . Actually I am right now in the restaurant. They have a buffet lunch. Once I took the curries I was told I will get the naan but I had to wait 30mins until I went and ask for it again. Atmosphere sucks. I would better have gone to some gas station and got Pringles.,1
"Do not go to the restaurant right now. The hotel is under construction and you will be dining in an auxiliary room, which has as much charm as a coat room. When I called and asked about having breakfast there, the gal on the phone didn't even mention this. I was meeting some out of town guests and was quite embarrassed.",1
"This is one of those places where you go by default. It's late. Or it's lunch. Nothing is nearby. Very few things are open. Julio's is right there. It's cheap. Why the hell not? This place is pretty damn solid. It's unhealthy. It's delicious. It's the perfect ""after party "" food. Catch my ndrift? Service can be a little slow, but whatevs.",2
WOOOOOOOW. sometimes the smallest problems are made waaay bigger by AWFUL service. love the place and the food was . yea ok. but the place was quarter full. tons of empty tables and man we had to get up and ask for stuff from anybody we could find. not going to review the food because at least for us. if the service isn't there. we'll pass. Hope you all have better luck.,1
For a BBQ Pork shop the pork was dry and Nasty. You got no choice of what sauce they put on your ribs. The service was worse than the pork. At one point there were no employees where a customer could find them. My wife had to go get her own silverware. The only good thing I had here were the chicken wings. For a pork shop really. There are better choice near by.,1
I used the company on July 3. The guys that actually moved me were very nice and helpful. I had multiple broken items that I emailed them and they negotiated a settlement. I can't say enough about the great service they provided after the check they sent was stolen. The owner takes a lot of pride in customer service and it shows. Wish all companies had this great of service!,2
Ordered so much food to be delivered. It was my sons birthday. Cheese fries .gross. Chicken fingers no flavor. Pan pizza .so much dough and sick flavor.threw it away. I don't think I would give it to a dog. Chicken Caesar salad.yuck. Sandwich.horrible. Subway is much better. Nothing good to say and spent over 60.00 feel burned. I will not be returning.to bad because they are close to my home.,1
"Outstanding customer service! I brought my mother in law's Mazda Protege in due to it running and idling really rough. Tsuyoshi diagnosed the problem with a quickness and ordered and received the parts the same day. He called me later in the day, I popped in to his shop and he swapped out the leaking vacuum lines and air intake io time flat. Absolutely top notch and highly recommended!",2
"The best nail salon in Tempe! They get very busy on Saturdays so best to make an appointment but that's because they are so good. There are endless gel polishes to choose from, the staff are courteous and skilled and I get compliments on my nails every time. I send everyone who asks me to AZ Tip and Toes.",2
"Justin Elite Floor Furniture Cleaning did a fantastic job cleaning the carpets and tile in my parent's new home. He really went above and beyond and was very prompt and dependable. I would recommend him to anyone. He's a really nice guy too, and he takes great pride in his work. Thanks again Justin!",2
"Eloff helped sell my mother in law's house in summerlin. He was super kind and definitely knows his stuff. He made sure that there were no surprises in the process and made sure that we knew all of our options. He got us more than we expected to get for the house, and it went through a lot faster than some of our friends said it took them. Definitely use Eloff, he will not disappoint.",2
"One of my favorite places to meet clients downtown, we enjoy their restaurant named District. The valet parking is complimentary if you're having lunch there.huge bonus. The hotel is very modern and the staff is friendly. During the off season, when they're slow, there's a ton of employees everywhere making sure you're well taken care of. I'm very impressed with this place. Return Factor 80 ",2
The food is not good. at all it is greasy and very low quality. nI cracked two teeth from chicken a bone hidden inside the sweet and sur chicken. This food leaves a bad after taste in your mouth. nI could of died from their food. The food is not fresh at all it is all frozefrom distributors that food and the chefs are worse than Panda Express. nThey sneeze in your food when your not looking.,1
"I made the mistake of going back. I just got home and literally insta vom'd. Fuck my life, what a bad choice. Also, the place still smells like farts. I can't believe I actually went back. You know what, five stars because this place is great if you want to lose weight. One star because you become anorexic for 2 days post sushi.",1
"Lots of transients soliciting for money or drugs in the parking lot. We just moved behind this Frys.I prefer to drive further to Safeway. Also this Frys is ridiculously over priced. Not a fan, however, it's convenient, it actually does sell water for 0.88 versus 0.89 at Safeway.there's an upside.right?",1
"Slowest place ever! Had 3 waiters walk by and stare at us without even smiling or greeting us. Took them about 10 15min to come to us. We ordered two drinks and that alone took almost 10 min. We closed out and left. Get it together, that was some BS. nThey knew we were upset when we left and got stares and no apology. Will never go back.",1
"I was very unhappy with this place. I ordered the biscuits and gravy after reading all the reviews, and was highly disappointed. I would think for a place that specializes in pork the sausage in the gravy would of been much better. But it tasted low quality. And the biscuits themselves where very dry. Wouldn't recommend to anyone who actually knows what good food taste like.",1
"I dislike most of the place on the strip. As someone who lived in Summerlin I rarely ever visited the strip, except for when visitors came in. Like most places along Las Vegas Boulevard, it caters to tourists, doesn't have discounts for locals and is overpriced. While the one redeeming quality is the unusual 10 Chupacabra spicy drink it's not worth making the trip too if you're a local.",1
note that the 2star rating is just compared to all resturaunts not just hawaiin ones. nfood was good. i dont know my way around hawaiin cuisine so who knows? i just know it tasted good but left me with a fast food feeling afterwards. n atmosphere was like. nah just do take out. the atmosphere is like an uncomfy mcdonalds made of fake bamboo with pictures of kids in bikinis. srsly kinda creepy.,1
"I would have to say that I'm disappointed. After reading the reviews on this site I was expecting it to be awesome. Unfortunately that's not really the case. Its super greasy and the sauce taste cheap. It honestly taste like a slightly upgraded version of Little Caesars or pizza patron. It's a great price at 5 per a medium pizza, but even that's not enough to make me go back sorry guys, no good ",1
"They are so nice and honest. I appreciated the fact that they didn't insist that I needed both front and rear brakes, as many other places the dealer certainly would have said. They came recommended as a family run shop and I liked the local feel. Plus they were really quick. I will definitely be back.",2
"This place is packed during lunchtime. However, you won't wait very long, because service is extremely fast. Not the place for a long lunch. I had glazed pork with a spring roll and vermicelli. I thought it was very good. My friend liked the pho. They give you tea and they will give you more if you ask . Prices are very good. 10 or less for both of us. Nothing in the menu is above 15.",2
I got a coupon in the mail for a free oil change here so I decided to bring my Mazda by. Austin in the service department was so nice and thorough. He brought a few issues to my attention and I completely trusted him. He ran through the list of items that needed attention and made sure I understood everything. I think I found my new shop for service and repairs!,2
"I've been going to this place for years since it was over near the hobby lobby , but I went recently and got some horrible sushi to go. It was inedible, extremely fishy and smelt like the Long Island Sound during low tide. The texture was felt like I was chewing on mashed potatoes. I was very surprised when I didn't end up with salmonella afterwards.",1
This place is not unlike a Cheesecake Factory. I had a FatTire and the Kobe burger. The burger was very good. I also tried the enchiladas and the angel hair pasta with shrimp. Everything here seems to be on point. Service is excellent. I came here with a long time local who recommended the place. A must go if in the area.,2
"This place really never disappoints! The sushi Menu is a little limited, but the rolls they do have are excellent. The bits menu is nice. Gives you a chance to try a few extra dishes. The wine and sake menus are average. Good beer list for and Asian restaurant. Getting a table on a busy night can be quite difficult. That is really the only down fall.",2
"Awesome food, great service! Green Flannel w poached eggs were perfect! Got extra jalape u00f1o and free chili for the flannel tasted great but they charged an extra 1 for each. But prices here are pretty reasonable so shouldn't really complain, but it would have beeice to know as I ordered vs seeing it on the check.",2
This is not authentic Chinese food. The fried rice taste like white rice and does not have the traditional egg mixed in. The sweet and sour sauce is bitter and stale. The pork in the egg rolls is bright red grounded meat. The mix of flavors with the vegetables is very off. The only item that was passable was the orange chicken. The second star is just for effort and not being overly salty.,1
"I had dinner here last year. LOVED it. It had a ""market "" inside, and their seafood was very fresh. I ordered a fish dish. Friend ordered scallops the staff got them from the market! . Both were wonderful. We also had Greek wine and drinks. Overall it was a fantastic experience. Well worth the price.",2
"I fixed my truck there few years back, it took three trips to fix the same problem the first time. Now My truck ended up getting a new axle, because they did not do it right last time. The break job they did also sucked, the breaks only lasted 3 years and 20 thousand miles. Don't get scamed here. find a local repair shop.",1
"The Pineville Ice House is kinda crappy. There is no lobby. You walk in and you're in the ice rink, so there isn't a warm place to hang out or put on your skates. The ice is not great quality, and I've been pretty disappointed overall with my experiences there. If you're looking for a rink in Charlotte, check out the Extreme Ice Center.",1
"Amazing place to take your child to swim, nWe started when our daughter was 10 months and I was nervous about her going under the water. The instructors are not pushy and they are very talented nShe is now 14 months and she swims underwater to me regularly nShe loves swimming and is excited to be there every time nThe building is also amazing and extremely clean. nI recommend this place highly!",2
"This place was amazing! It's off the strip, but definitely worth a cab ride to. We ordered n bowl of clam chowder n jumbo bacon wrapped shrimp n combo pan roast with rice For two people, this was wayyyy too much food. But everything was delicious! Our bill came out to under 50, which I have to say is good for a seafood meal. The wait was long, but worth it.",2
"One word WOW. This club is truely amazing. It is not just a nightclub, it is an experience. It's like being in a dance club and watching a show all at once. The club is so spacious that you can take a break from dancing if you need and look over the whole place. If you want to be in the center of the action like we were be prepared to have your body vibrating throughout.",2
"This is my least favorite of the TMADs in my area. Chicken is almost shredded hope it's shredded chicken and not something else when it's suppose to be cut. Food looks as if it were just thrown together with little emphasis on appearance as opposed to the TMAD on St Rose Wigwam . If you're looking for an average meal at best, this is the place for you",1
"BLEH! This place is in the Aria and this is how they treat it?!?! ahhaha. jk the decor is nothing special, the music is House ALL night. This was a Friday night! The only cool thing was the drink specials for girls. Like 4 drink tickets per person.that had to be used before 12 AM. I hate that I arrived at 1150PM. LOL! Still was able to get drunk off of what I had.",1
"This is a Fantastic place for good quality ,BIG quantity dinners. Nestled in a quaint little shopping center near Castle Shannon , no parking problems , fast easy seating , not too noisey , very nice menu. very reasonable prices. friendly staff. Defiantly not a hipster place , nice bar. Clean dinning area and rest room.",2
"Small, just small. No space on the floor to do non equipment workouts, closes early on weekends, not humid enough, I felt that painful cold air in my throat as I ran. Not enough space in the free weights section.maybe Its because I'm used to 24 hour fitness, but my workout didn't feel complete since I didn't get to relax my muscles in the sauna afterward.",1
We'll the food is good but the conversations we had to listen to from the staff was disgusting. I would somewhat get it if they were in the back and I heard it but they were sitting at a table eating at the table next to us having the conversation the whole time we were there. They have lost my business for good and I won't be back.,1
"Great sushi. Mid range price, a little on the expensive side but worth it for the atmosphere and unique sushi choices. Good for lunch too, quick call ahead take out. Highly recommended to those who enjoy good Japanese food in a quiet atmosphere. Even at 12 during the week the place is very accomodating and very good. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because Sushi 101 is better!",2
"21 MINUTES! That's how long it took for delivery to get to me! Hands down the fastest delivery I've ever experienced. I ordered egg drop soup, crab rangoon and moo goo gai pan. All for only 15 bucks. They threw in a free egg roll and fortune cookies. Great place! It's the 3rd place I've tried for Chinese delivery in Vegas and by far the best so far.",2
"It's too bad that I cannot review the doctor. I called to set up an appointment per instructions from the Animal Foundation for my newly adopted dog, and the lady was rude, didn't listen to what I was saying, and treated me as if I was an interruption. I won't go to a place that treats me like that on the phone.",1
"Just did my first gel pedicure, the lady did a really good job, even offered an extra coat caus she wanted it to be brighter. Chairs, sink areas, etc clean. Customers are mostly classy and polite, not loud rude or obnoxious so far which is important to me. if i wanna see hear ghetto girls in salon ill go to walmart salon! Hahaha but not here. Nice spot close to home. Love it.",2
My radio and navigation system went out on my Acura. I took it in to Zimbrick who immediately determined that a small fuse had blown. I was glad it was only a fuse until I pick up the car and was charged 100 for replacing a two dollar fuse. I complained but got nowhere. They have since lost several thousand dollars of my service business to other repair shops.,1
"Restrooms very clean. And I needed them after eating at the bufftet. I went to the buffet because of high ratings on another site, but it was underwhelming. That said, I did win 114 downstairs before I left. So all in all the night was not a loss. If you are looking for a good but less expensive buffet, this is not it.",1
"We travel quite a bit and the dinner here was excellent , Marco was an awesome waiter and really pointed out some wonderful choices! The cowboy steak was my favorite and the prime rib and fillet were great also! Mark the supervisor checked in on us to make sure everything was top notch, kudos to meritage!",2
I hope that a sinkhole opens under this nuisance. The lack of noise barriers and the racing of unregulated unmuffled cars makes this audible for miles around on Sundays in the summer. If this was in any other city it would have been closed long ago for noise and pollution inside city limits. Hopefully the new assistant living community right next door will complain enough that it gets shut down.,1
"Ordered 10 pieces of Dim Sum to go. Was sadly disappointed by their limp unappetizing look. I expected proper Dim Sum but got steamed dumplings. Watch out. Priced too high 10 pieces here is more expensive than 15 pieces at Mai Xiang Yuan, which are awesome! but they taste excellent. Can't decide between 3 and 4 stars, so I am rounding up. but I would say 3.5 ",2
"Just not feeling it. Food isn't good enough to overcome the unfriendly, distant, and slow service. Sorry. Now if your food was tastier, I could live with a little less service. But it isn't. So what we have here is a quite ordinary burger joint coupled with lousy service. If I ever end up back here, it won't be because I want to, but because there is an hour wait at Yardhouse.",1
"I love Pei Wei and couldn't resist eating here after my flight since the two close to my home recently changed. Decided to try their new Mandarin Kung Pao bad decision. It was pure salt! Hardly any chicken in the fried batter, no mandarin flavor what so ever, and did I mention, SALTY! The two people beside me ordered the Mongolian steak and spicy chicken I became jealous quick!",1
"chandler fashion center was very big! we grabbed a directory and planned our route. they had a lot of your basic stores something you'd find in your everyday, run of the mill mall. except that these stores were on steroids! the forever 21 i walked into was magnificent! it would be good to spend and entire shopping day here.",2
My co worker and I decided to leave work to have a meeting off site. I came here because of the awesome reviews. This place is very retro and has a cozy atmosphere. Having our meeting here made us more relaxed and was able to discuss ideas clearly. We ordered the green smoothie and we loved it. I will come back here again.,2
"Just like home! Now that I have moved far from home it's hard to find that home Filipino cooking either it's not fresh or the flavors are just off. Gingerroot did a spectacular job, their pork was crispy, the dinaguan had the right amount of vinegar and the right amount of patis was added to the pancit.",2
"One of my new favorite places to eat, have been here everyweek this month, my favorite is the shrimp linguine and clam clowers my husbands eats the boillebesse and some oysters he also loves it. Take cook right at the bar. The guys there are super friendly. I forgot to mention has delicious the banana foster is, but i would ask for the ice cream on the side. This will be place we frequently visit.",2
"Love this place. Great wine list and they have some interesting specialty drinks if you are interested. Brick oven pizza and wings are some of the best in Pittsburgh. Had the pork shank and it was prepared perfectly with bacon mashed potatoes. The beet salad is great. Save room for desert, they are wonderful. Service was good. Like the decor but it can get a little noisy.",2
"Yeah its cheap all you can eat, but if you're a girl and can't eat 5 plates like a guy then it's not worth it. Not alot of vegetarian options even though its a BUFFET, and the food looked old and stale. We ate anyways and by 8pm when we were going to a show we all got sick from the food. Ew, ew, ew!",1
First of all I never write reviews. I purchased a Yankee Candle from this location. The candle's wick was too close to the glass causing the candle to blow up and the glass to shatter. I took it back to the store and the store manager Rick refused to offer a refund or even a partial refund. Good prices are not worth it if T J Maxx refuses to stand behind what they sell.,1
"I am a big Bobby Flay fan and was excited to eat at his restaurant. I was with a buddy on business, so we just sat at the bar. The service was poor, my steak was well done I ordered medium , and the wine that was recommended was fair. Maybe cut one of your three shows on FoodTV and spend some time in Vegas training your staff.",1
"Yeah! On my first trip, I had the Lamb shank and it was absolutely great the best lamb shank ever. Girlfriend had the chicken kabob, it was good too. On my second trip, I had the cornish game hen grilled absolutely fabulous moist, juicy, tasty. Place has a nice, cozy feel to it and prices seem reasonable. I'll be back!",2
"This place is so good, I feel like I should write another review on it. Whenever I want some comfort food, this is the place to go. The staff makes me feel at home and the food never disappoints. It was my first time having POG here and it's so good. You can also find little Iron Man here with hulk hands. So cute. lol",2
"Oh LV Airport, you scare me. No, your security line up people scare me. The yelling. WHY MUST YOU YELL? See, that's not nice. It makes people not want to listen to you when you yell. Next time, be nice. The airport itself is fine, but the gates get too packed, and you find yourself STANDING without a seat, and that sucks, especially when you're tired. Oh well.",1
"The store staff tell you to buy items, take it home, try it on and bring it back if you don't like it. What they don't tell you if they only grant store credit. Breach of several laws but store managers indifferent. There are too many alternatives in this shopping mall to put up with this unconscionable practice.",1
"Food is great and the drinks are yummy too. Ordered egg salad sandwich on croissant and their iced coffee Arnold Palmer. I would have given this place 5 stars except there are SO MANY FLIES in this place! I can see the flies crawling on all the pastries and that was a negative. Other than the flies, everything else was great ",2
"OMFG. This place is AMAZING for vegans and meat lovers! I love their banana bread waffles GLUTEN FREE! hash browns different kind compared to common hash browns amazing texture in your mouth , and the eggplant bacon are to die for! Sunday brunches are awesome. This place reminds me of Portland. Cool chill waiters. Small cute breakfast joint. You'll be happily full and healthy!",2
Dr. Casey and Dr. Emerson do a great job with my 2 dogs. I have a diabetic 10 year old husky with hypothyroidism. so let's just say I've seen some vets. McDowell Mountain did an excellent job stabilizing my dog's insulin and finding the right dosage. Two other vets in the area were unable to get it right. The staff is friendly and the service is thorough. I'd highly recommend MMAH.,2
"I feel compelled to raise my rating. After a back and forth, and my previously posted review, Ashley customer service arranged for, and in fact completed, an exchange of our dining room table. The new table is just that, exactly what we wanted, a new table. Best of all, we were not charged delivery for the later exchange. All's well that ends well.",1
"The place is lousy. Longest wait time anywhere. Even a oil change takes a whole day. any car repair maybe 2 days, I got a quote for catalytic sensor, they wanted 500. I asked Oreily how much was the sensor, 40 they say. I asked another mechanic how long to put in sensor, he said 15 min. Flather is over price and incompetent",1
"Although it was a bit difficult to find, once we found it, we were pleasantly pleased. The meal was worth the menu prices and the service was decent. Be sure to ask them to validate your parking. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to the broom and mop being stored in plain sight along with a high chair.sort of gave the place an iHop feel when it really isn't necessary.",2
"This is definitely a dive bar. The service is average, the food is not bad, the TVs are terrible like 15 years old , and the patrons are mostly creepy old dudes. I will not be coming back here. If they would update the TVs and get a better selection at the bar whiskeys etc I may consider returning. Overall, not very impressed.",1
Don't bother with upgrading past the luxury manicure. Not worth it! I went with two friends and they got the luxury and I got the deluxe. No difference! The owner tried telling me that I got a longer massage which is a lie because we all were done together. They also rush a lot more when they have customers waiting. I get different service every time. The gal who did my mani pedi was very nice.,1
"I am a big fan. Just when I was missing the BBQ back home, I found this place. They are fast and courteous, have all the proper fixins' onions and pickles! and their sauce is DELICIOUS. The price is a little high, but I guarantee you won't leave hungry no matter what you order. The Texas Po Boy is easily the most delicious thing I have experienced here. Do not miss out on it.",2
"ive been eating this place just about everyday at the palms since they opened alright i lied, multiple times a day its really quite good and so much better than whats available 24 hours there. mcdonalds, mexican and a overpriced below average diner the only thing is i wish there sandwiches were bigger. there more like a snack then a meal never the less there good.",2
"My husband and I finally decided to try this place yesterday. We will never go back. The food was not good. My husband's calzone was tasteless and too much bread and not enough fillings. I ordered a burger and fries and the fries were undercooked and the burger very greasy. I felt ill the rest of the night. However, we did have good service and the beer was very cold, but still won't go back.",1
What an amazing event! We had a fantastic preview.of the generous pour event at capital grill. We were able to try samples of six wines paired with delicious seafood and steak. Everything was top quality and we gained valuable knowledge regarding the food and beverages as well. Thank you to the capital grill and Lindsey for a wonderful evening!,2
"It was late and we were out wandering the casinos. Decided to walk from the Tropicana to Hooters just to see what it was all about. Wow it was really lame. A very small casino with a few tables, slots, restaurants and I guess a club. We were in and out in about 5 minutes. The place was dead. Doubt I would ever return.",1
The staff was extremely nice. This place is really clean and smells nice. This is my first time here and I had Jennifer as am massage therapist and she is wonderful. She asked what where my problem areas and made sure to focus on those areas. I really like this place because of the prices. I got an excellent massage and i did not have to break the bank.,2
"Great wine bar for a happy hour or a date night. The appetizers, wine, and main dishes are high quality for reasonable prices. I love the cheese platter and fish tacos especially! I really like the number of small dishes they have too so you can snack on multiple items without feeling stuffed at the end. The waitstaff here has always been great too.",2
"Huge Expectations. Huge disappointment! nComing from San Francisco, we expected Bouchon in Vegas to have the same quality, flavor and excellence as Keller's Napa outpost. Do not waste your time should be at the pool, not at a restaurant for hours or money 100 for 2 for a dry, lackluster brunch! at Bouchon.",1
"Still no improvement, I see. I have been making the hike to JD Birds and My Best Friend pet store for supplies. I'm going in soon to recheck the status of Cage World and if it looks the same way it did in August, I'm contacting authorities and rescues to make sure these folks aren't acquiring birds from them.",1
"To be fair, Edinburgh is not the best place for supermarkets. Prior to moving here I was dedicated to Tesco, however, Sainsbury's at Cameron Toll is far superior to any of the Tesco's I've visited in the city. The range of items available here is very good and often have very good BOGOF offers. The onyl downside is that you have to walk through Cameron Toll shopping centre to get to it.",2
"Ok, I thought that all Arizona Auto Wash locations are the same. But it's NOT. After going to another location, I've found out that this is one of the few places that literally do hand wash. It does not do special deals like 10 basic wash but that extra 2 is totally worth it. If you care about your car, go here!",2
"Ruined a dress shirt that I took in with one small stain that I could live with, but I thought to give the cleaners a shot. Got my shirt back with ten or so stains just on the front. How does that happen?! My husband picked it up without a warning and paid for it, completely unaware. First and last visit for me.",1
"I ran here on a whim last weekend because I was in the area and it was recommended to me by a friend, so glad I did. I ordered the 38 with a chicken substitute instead of the pork and it was pretty tasty, the fried rice was excellent, the meat was tender and marinated just right, even the egg roll was good. I will definitely be back.",2
"REAL Mexican food not your fast food, no choice, no flavor food. Typical menu and everything I wanted and more! Reasonably priced I was a little put off at first that I had to pay for chips and salsa, but well worth it. My husband and I will def be back for dinner again friendly staff, simply decorated and delicious food.",2
"The food is good typical of any Paradise Bakery. Good breads, meats, salads and the cookies. n The facility is great, but parking is horrible. n The reason for the low score is the staff. It seemed like they were all moving under water. The sandwich guy may have been the slowest person I've ever seen. Lethargic would be a good description.",1
"A reliable, trustworthy cleaner for your dry clean onlys that won't rip you off is hard to come by. Green's owner, however, really gives you that sense that she cares about your clothes she gave me tips, for instance, on how to keep crickets and moths at bay from my winter cashmere. Best of all, she will give customers, new and old, a 20 discount with or without the coupon. Try Green Cleaners out!",2
"Tonsof selection, yes the crab legs where the highlight. Prime rib was over done but there was plenty of other options to choose from. I thought the dessertselection was better than the food selections personally but that is just me. It was pricy but worth the experiance. I would go hungry, you have a lot of food to work though.",2
"They have a ton of Fat Tuesdays and imitators all over the Strip and casinos, and I'm so happy that's the case. Who doesn't love a dangerously innocuous seeming yardlong slushie alcoholic beverage? My favorites are the peach bellini, mango and strawberry. A trip to Vegas isn't complete without a yardlong girly drink. Yum.",2
"A fairly new outlet mall that's nested in the Westgate center and near the University of Phoenix Stadium, home of the AZ Cardinals. The location is ideal for a day spent shopping, dining and events but the outlet center itself lacks in entertainment. It is quite small and the store selection is limited.",1
"Went here for a Frozen Fury LA Kings Annual Preseason Hockey Game and every seat is great. The arena looks huge on TV but when you're there it's small. I'm sure its a great place to watch boxing, UFC and concerts. The seats were not too bad and I'm a big guy and accessibility from the hotel wasn't hard at all.",2
"Three friends I all in our twenties stayed in a hotel room here overnight. The decor is beautiful, and the service was quick and easy. The concierge gave us free covers into the local bars at the epicentre so be sure to ask. The room was beautiful, the beds were comfortable, and it was a great price to stay downtown. It was a great hotel experience!",2
"Went in with my work crew, got a southwest burger and was not disappointed. The bun was super soft and the sauce they used was a really nice combo to the beans! The fries are fresh, which is always a plus. They remind me of five guys fries. They have a giant patio which I thoroughly enjoyed! ill be back. They need a dessert!",2
I love their food but their customer service Carmen is atrocious. There is something to be said about a business that doesn't value their customers. If you have tolerance for a sour face and mean attitude but love good pizza then this is the place for you. Do delivery so you don't have to be insulted and disrespected by the cashier.,1
"Fine steaks and Martinis. Definately a keeper inside Green Valley Ranch. I love the food and its all good. Try the seafood como appetizer and you get it all. Pricey but good. Lump crabmeat cocktail, filet, potato and whiskey and the party is on! But they seem to get lounge lizard musicians that dont help the great vibe in the room.",2
"This is the place for delicious burgers, sweet potato fries and alcoholic shakes. My burger was so perfectly cooked and tasty. The sweet potato fries and shakes were delicious and prepared just right. I will warn you though the quantities are large so come hungry or else you will be able to finish your meal.",2
"Jeff is AMAZING! Has an amazing selection, but best of all they custom design whatever you can dream of. He made my wife's wedding ring and it is amazing. Easy to deal with as well. Jeff made us feel like we were his only customers whenever we were there and continues to treat us like royalty even though we may not be big spenders like some of his clients.",2
"This place lives up to the hype. Reasonably priced Korean Mexican fusion. The bulgogi enchiladas, Koreaachos, and Philly cheesesteak are great. Service is good. This is not a health food, arugula, anorexic chic restaurant. This is a place for people who like food and are ok with the fact that eating involves calories.",2
"Just visited for the first time while in town. Service was awesome. The owner, Nick greets you at the door and thanks you on the way out. All staff in between were friendly and efficient nThe food was great! We had pancakes, bacon, French toast, chicken fried steak and Philly cheesesteak. All were generous, fresh and very tasty! The restaurant was very clean! Worth the wait!",2
"the only reason i didn't give five stars is because my server didn't refill my water. other than that, the food and ambiance was great. I am a sushi oriental food connoisseur. dragon roll was off the hook, the peking duck was very tasty, tender yet buttery. yum. they even went out of their way to make my softshell crab my way.",2
"Its a nice hotel with great service but our room was right over the freeway and it was loud all night. There windows are thin and it might as well be open all night. The helicopter that flew over for an hour didnt help either. If we go back, i will not get a room by the freeway. Didnt get to sleep at all. nThe breakfast wasnt bad for a continental.",1
"I don't know why, but I love going here. The service can be hit or miss, but it's just a place where you can go, be comfortable at, get consistently good food, and order a huge ass glass of beer. I crave the jalapeno burger with veggie patties all of the time it could possibly be the least healthy veggie burger of all time, with double paddies and oozing with cheese but damn its good.",2
Ate here with a large group. The service was terrific and very accommodating. Friendly atmosphere and it felt like they were really happy to see us. The food was excellent. I had the walleye and it was terrific. My cousin had a pasta dish and she was very pleased as well. There wasn't one complaint among us.,2
"Funghi pizza Crispy, chewy crust topped with the perfect blend of wild mushrooms! Pesto pizza deliciously chewy crust with basil pesto sauce and cherry tomatoes, a little too heavy on the cheese for my liking. Margherita pizza same amazing crust, my only complaint is too much cheese making the pizza very heavy.",2
"A lot better than In and Out burgers if you ask me. Gets a little expensive when your ordering for the whole family and adding drinks and fries to that, but totally worth it. Fresh lettuce and tomatoes, quality ingredients is what you're paying for. Plus I love all the different options when choosing your fountain drink.",2
"They mean well, but they tend to just mimic a kind of semi swank 90's steak seafood house. The decor resembles that of an okay Hilton. The service is friendly but sometimes rather slow. The food is decent, but nothing special steaks that are alright, ceasar salads with too much dressing etc . It is a last resort kind of place when everything else has a long line.",1
"WTF Tony? Seriously, I used to love this place! On a recent visit here, my ribs were dry, boney, and had very little meat. No more deliciously flavored sauces at the table. You get one ""coaster "" dish containing about half an ounce of sauce.I asked for 4. Who doesn't love sauce with their ribs? Their Hefeweizen beer is also WAY over priced. Service was average, at best.",1
Overall wasn't Impressed at all prices ehh over priced service sucked I'll give them two stars because I enjoyed the time spent with my dad and girlfriend that's about it yes the food is huge and they give you about a free whatever it is to check in there well let's just say don't get suckered in by that like I did Total bust!,1
"This is a mixed review. I love these ridiculous hot dogs and equally absurd fried offerings oreos, twinkies, and pb j . I also love the show put on by the dog barristas. I love the price 10 for 2 people . nThe place itself is a hole a dive a dump. Be prepared to wipe down a table and to stand in a line filled with wobbling drunks.",1
"Terrible, terrible customer service. You would think with all the poor reviews management would take the time and correct the problem. This KFC is alway out of chicken. Today, I had a 30 minute wait for a pot pie and popcorn chicken shortly after they opened. That is not fast food. The staff is lazy and do not care about customer service.",1
"Cute space on 7th Avenue! I was expecting more grocery items instead of a cafe, but still liked it nonetheless. I tried the chocolate croissant and the pumpkin roll.both were amazing! Definitely the kind of place you can stop in on a regular basis to enjoy a coffee and pastry or for soup and sandwich for lunch.",2
Just ordered a chicken breast sandwich at Samuel Adams in the Pittsburgh airport. They served me flavored pressed chicken paste made to look like a grilled chicken breast. Could not eat even one bite. They did not charge me even though I offered to pay. My reaction to their chicken paste must be fairly common.,1
Dr. Wilson is awful. I read the review of the person who had a hysterectomy there 3 years ago and is still having issues. . Well join the club I'm 1.5 years post op from her butchering hands and I had to have a second surgery by another doctor. I'm better but still have pain. They removed non dissolvable stitches that she uses and a hematoma. She is awful. Run don't walk away from this doctor!,1
"I definitely had better. This place is over rated. Second time I have been here and had the same poor experience. I felt I was paying more for the location than I was for the food. The food was okay and the service was poor. If you ever decide to go eat around west gate I recommend you try the Yard House, they have a great selection of beer and some great lunch and dinner items.",1
"Still one of the best vegan joints in town special brunch options on weekends, though they recently changed the brunch menu and added heuvos rancheros and replaced their awesome waffles with moderately okay pancakes. If you're going for weekend brunch make sure to go early, massive lineups after 12 30 parking is free before 1pm also ",2
"The best chocolate chip cookies in town! All of the baked muffins, cookies are really fantastic here but the triple chocolate chip cookies are amazing! Delicious healthy salads and sandwiches, Chloes Corner never disappoints! Friendly service, clean restaurant and bathroom. Haven't been for breakfast brunch yet but the lunch menu is solid and this place is always very popular and busy!",2
"I was at a Yelp! pARTy a few days ago held at the Phoenix Art Museum and was able to sample the meatball and pasta at the Mamma Mia stand. They were freakin' amazing! The pasta was perfect so tender and creamy, and the meatballs. oh, the meatballs. I didn't care for the cheese pizza offered I'll have to check out other toppings , but I cannot wait to go for my first visit!",2
"Horrible management . Pizza is what u pay for. a gallon of grease!this is by far a disgrace to new York. This is a chain an won't go far, if your selling this for food you should think about just donating it to the homeless ""sorry homeless "" but this pizza and service sucks. horrible. crap. ect.ect.",1
"I've been here a few times. We always try to stop here for a meal before we head home from our trip. I've yet to try their shakes which I hear are superb, but next time for sure. I got their sliders the first time and their classic burger the second time. nThe burgers were pefectly done, well to the way I asked for it anyway. In summary, the food is good and the service is slow. But I like it.",2
"My family has been going here since a was a kid.lets just say it's been open when there was a star dust casino.great authenticity in their food. The peaking duck, yum! Baked pork chops with peaking sauce delish! A wide selection in meats and seafood on the menu. Service it's ok. They are friendly though. Great hole in the wall place to visit! Prices are decent",2
"I've had several procedures done here,and none of them had any effect, so they just suggest another procedure. The staff can't even manage an IV. The place seems drab and dirty and they are only interested in scheduling expensive procedures. Make sure you have great insurance! Or better yet, find another doctor!",1
"BED BUGS! Just checked out of the planet Hollywood hotel and as I speak I have been standing in the lobby for about an hour waiting for a ""manager "" I missed my flight my luggage has bed bugs and they seem to not care. this shitty place deserves this review. If you stay at planet Hollywood have fun trying to wear a tank top with red bed bug bites all over your arm.",1
"I had a groupon for this place that was about to expire so we decided to check this out on Tuesday night. The place is really small compared to other yogurt places we've visited and they only had about 7 8 flavor choices. Their toppings bar wasn't much better in terms of selection. Like Dave said, if you're in the area, you're better off visiting Yogurtology or Sweet Republic.",1
The manager at the store Eric was extremely rude and less than helpful when I went in seeking answers to simple questions. He told me he would get to me as soon as possible and stood by the door for 15 minutes waiting for customers to come in. Doing nothing. He was a poor excuse for a manager and should lose his job! Never been treated so bad!,1
"Not an authentic Italian deli. Poor quality of meats and everything else can be had at most supermarkets around here. The staff is rude to top it all off. Cannolis are ok, but not the best I've had. I was expecting to be able to order a great sandwich with some good prosciutto or mortadella and all I got was a subway quality sandwich. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!",1
"Been here twice now friendly staff, nice environment with a good choice of Margarita's and more. I was given a free guacamole coupon at the nearby Hyatt Place ask for one! and so started with a free dish of table side guacamole 3 avacodo's followed by taco's with all the trimmings and two excellent margarita's. then a free Hyatt shuttle to a good night's sleep!",2
"I have eaten many times at this restaurant located just down the street from the Bell Center. Not sure why, but lunch times there is always lots of place, no real reservations required. The table d'hote is always fantastic, from the fish to the pasta. The deserts are awesome and the small bite size portion is a great way to finish off a meal.",2
"I really love the food here. I tried the beef lamb gyro with the Athenian fries for lunch. Soo good! For dinner I tried the gryo plate huge portions in my opinion , the hummus super silky smooth, best I've ever had , and grilled octopus. The atmosphere is very clean and friendly. Next thing going to try is some dessert!",2
"I love going to this spa. I go once a month for waxing services. I go see the same esthetician every time Candice and she is consistently great. The prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is totally relaxing. Definitely check this place out. And ask for Candice.once you find a great esthetician, you don't want anyone else.",2
"Get what you pay for I guess. I waited over an hour in line and that almost killed my plans. I had really given myself a lot of time to get to the out of town wedding in time, but that wait at the rental place at the airport really put me back and I BARELY made it in time for the wedding. Do yourself a favor and if you value your time, spend some extra and don't rent based on the lowest rates.",1
"Been to this store three times looking for a new bike. Great looking store with amazing selection. The worst customer service I've ever had! I was looking into making a trip to California to buy until I found All Mountain Bikes in Boulder City, not the biggest store, but the salesman Jeff took amazing care of me. Worth the drive out for sure!",1
"I've had no problems with this office. I only waited 15 min past my appt standard for a doc office, if you ask me . The entire staff has always been pleasant and helpful. I've seen both Isaac and Kelly, both were attentive and kind. The glo minerals selection is also off the charts! I love this office.",2
"I'm in college, i eat a lot of burgers. this place has always had the best hands down. people say the owners changing ruined it but i've been going here since 1994 and its still F ing epic. if you want the old people to 'chill' with visit the diamond but if you want awesome food, service, and atmosphere, go here.",2
"This was my first and last visit to tailgaters. We came in and ordered takeout. We ordered an order of 10 boneless wings. It took 25 minutes to get our order. Then when we get home, I open the box and there are 8 tiny pieces of chicken. They were the worse tasting wings I have ever eaten. I ate two and threw the rest in the trash!",1
"Over rated, and Over Hyped. I cant figure out why these cupcakes sell. They are Dry, icing not that great but what they do have is the best service i have experienced in a food setting. And location, location, location. But at the end of the day even though they have great service, the product they sell is really bad.Pretty presentation but super dry cupcakes.what happend to moist",1
"Was here twice between August 1 4, 2014. Service was a little slow one night but they were busy. Had country fried steak and eggs one night and the gumbo and cheese burger the next time. Both meals were very good. Good value. I've had there rib eye special in the past and it's good as well. Try it you won't be disappointed. I will return.",2
Came here on Christmas Eve with my family. Everything we got was amazing. Perfect ambiance for a Christmas Eve dinner. Steak oscar style was great. Chopped salad off menu was awesome. CRAB CAKES are the best. Their pineapple house martini was delicious as well. I liked everything except the desserts lemon cake and bread pudding! PASS! Much better other places. So skip that. Good food here!,2
This is the coolest place to shop on the strip. There is a good mix of high end and medium retailers here. The drawbacks being it is difficult fo find your way out of this maze and food is very expensive inside. Still our favorite place to shop in Vegas though. I am not sure but I think the Statue of the God's show and other statues that came to life are currently not running ,2
"Nights and weekends are difficult. The check outs have long lines, there are no less than 20 items or 10 items check outs. Their inventory control is terrible. Many times they're out of items. I was there last Wednesday 8 6 14 and tried to check out, finally doing so at 8 50pm. Not late at night. I will not go nights or weekends again, and only if I absolutely have to any other time.",1
I completely agree with the other comments. I am not familiar with Mike but there is a women who I have to interact with every time I have to mail an ebay package and she is just terrible. I will update this post once I find out her name. Overall terrible customer service in the post office portion of the store.,1
"Outstanding, a real gem! We were in Goodyear AZ for 5 days. We found The Black Bear through a Yelp Breakfast search and didn't see a point in trying any place else. Great food and great service. We had Breakfast there every day.From the homemade corn beef hash and sausages to the biscuits all are OUTSTANDING!",2
"This place is middle of the road, definitely not four stars thanks a lot Hotwire . Plenty of WT and tour groups. Drunk WT tried to chase my girlfriend oumerous occasions when I wasn't around. r n r nThe only good thing is you can find 10 BJ tables on Saturday night. r n r nAnd by BJ I don't mean THAT.",1
"There used to be a Monti's across from Fiesta mall and that was a much better location. The ambience in this location is horrible, even if it is considered a landmark. The bread they give wasn't as good as the one at the newer Monti's that closed down. The fried zucchini I ordered was also hard and tasted really bad. One of the worst dining experiences that I've had.",1
"I'm not a big fan of BBQ, but it's Father's Day and my dad went to the Texas location on a job, so he was excited to see there was one in here. We went and I was very impressed! It was great! BBQ sauce is typically to sweet for me and the meat is often over cooked. But NOT here! It was amazing! I'll come again when I'm in towext and highly recommend everyone give it a try.",2
"If it was possible to provide negative stars I would. The entire experience was so awful, the only thing they have going for them is they are better than greyhound, but not by much. nThe only thing they are consistent at is being consistently awful. I fly over 100 segments a year and they still manage to surprise me.",1
"We were given free entry and free drinks until midnight the club has a really weird vibe and audience. You can see the fountains from here but that's the only good part. designed to be almost exclusively for tables, there is no room to move or dance even at 11pm when people haven't even shown up yet. the drinks were also very weak.",1
"A clean, well stocked gym with a swimming pool a little small , basketball court, free classes, sauna and hot tub. There are lots of nautilus machines and free weights, as well as lots of treadmills, bikes and stair climbers. The machines are clean and so is the men's locker room. The staff is friendly and helpful. One of the better gyms I've ever been in.",2
"I stopped by here recently around 9am and the donuts I got tasted like they were made a week ago. Stale and old. I thought they were supposed to make them fresh regularly? I love Krispy Kreme donuts, but this location seems to be run by a Dunkin' Donuts undercover spy hellbent on tainting the good name of Krispy Kreme. This saddens me greatly.",1
"Who knew eating healthy could taste so good. My wife absolutely loves this place and has gotten so much inspiration for our habits at home from this place. For me it's 5 stars for the food and atmosphere. Only downside is its not cheap. You'll shell out to eat here. I do suggest their smoothies, excellent.",2
"Great place to shop, dine, people watch, and just pure walking around. From high end designer to random novelty shops, this place has it all. I also think it's super cool that the ceilings are like the sky. Stop by the Atlantis show near cheesecake factory. I'm not a big shopper when I come to vegas since there's plenty of shopping available where I live but I like to walk around here for fun.",2
"This place is freakin huge. Acres upon acres of grass fields for soccer or football or if you just want to run your dog. Always pick up after your dog tho. Plenty of times if seen owners walk away from their mess. Any ways, they have walking and bike paths, nice baseball fields and big shaded areas with restrooms. Great family place",2
I love F F! The staff are all very friendly and do a good job of greeting you by your name when you walk in. I've only tried the barre class and it's pretty good. I don't think I get as much of a workout as with other barre classes that I've tried but the location is fantastic and the studios are spacious and immaculate.,2
I am a big fan of CZ. I don't like this particular location though. I know that they just opened but I am not impressed. I am from Utah and the one up there is on point. The service here is not very good. They skimp on the ingredients and its not very fresh. I am hoping to come back in a few weeks and give this location another shot. At the current time I can only justify a 2 star rating.,1
Pretzel bread is buttery and fluffy. But that's probably it. Everything else is mediocre. Slow service. Plain food. Lunch menu is small and uninteresting. But VERY busy for some reason around noon. So make reservation and you can get yourself a spot among the Very Important looking People. But I don't get the hype.,1
"Atmosphere is fun food no different than Mexican restaurants elsewhere even Boston Borders Cafe has better food . The chips might have been the worst we have had. We were expecting more given all the hype. And all the other reviews. Since this seems to be a chain, maybe we just had a bad experience at this specific one.",1
"Too bad we weren't 21, because you need alcohol to make this place okay. The appetizer did not have a volcano as described and the meat in it was dry. The crab cake seemed old and left an oily taste in our mouths. If we ever do come back here when we are in Vegas, it will be strictly to try their drinks.",1
"I prefer the Culinary Dropout that is attached to The Yard in Central Phoenix. The enviornment on the weekends is great. Always busy, good drinks, food and music. Plus they have this awesome photo booth machine that you can upload, email and text your pictures from. They do close at 12am so that's the only downfall!",2
"I lived down the street from Carly's for 5 years and only managed to go there once. That was one salty, miserable biddy at the bar and from what I could see, that's the kind of trick they always like to hire. I am not trying to have an adversarial relationship with someone who is bringing me drink and food. Place reeks of the famous Phoenix snarkiness. F that!",1
Went to Blue Adobe on Tuesday. The Owners greeted us and remembered us from our previous visit. Tuesday is Taco Night and a Taco Plate is only 6.99. I ordered the taco plate and a margarita. My wife and son split the pulled pork salad. Both meals were excellent. The service was also impeccable. I would highly recommend the Blue Adobe.,2
"They hem pants in an hour and they're open on Sundays. What's not to love? I've had two pairs of pants hemmed here when you're short all of the pants you buy are going to need to be hemmed and both times they've done them in an hour while I walked around East Towne Mall. Plus their prices are on the lower end of the spectrum. Quick, cheap and efficient. Win win.",2
Kabobs with rice! that is the only thing on this menu I would suggest. The salad is horrible. Which a salad should be easy. The chicken fingers don't waste your time. We've tried this place 3 times because the kabobs are good. But all other dishes were a waste of time. The Philly cheese steak is ok not fabulous.,1
"There are not enough great things to say about this place! Huge selection of wine and craft beer and amazing customer service. My first visit there, I was checking out their beer selection, unaware of the walk in beer cave and a manager came up to me to show me they had everything cold. After a long day, I needed em cold! Cigar selection, too. I have not used the car wash here.",2
"Loved this place! Just tried it out for the first time last night. I moved to put a few months back and no nothing of the town, travel weekly for business so I have tried my share of local taverns and this place is welcoming, fun and cozy. The staff behind the bar consists of the owner, family and friends which makes for a great atmosphere.",2
Lets just say it kind of sucked. Stayed at the Pointe across the street and heard good things. The beer was the best part. which was bottled. not here. I do not even remember what I had it was so good. Puffy chips? Who the hell wants wierd puffy chips!? Go somewhere else. On The Border is almost better Mexican food. and that place is terrible!,1
This is one of our go to Mexican places. They have a surprisingly extensive menu with a lot of vegetarian options and of course the classics. Their chips and salsa are muy delicioso and their margaritas are yummy. The servers are always consistently great. The only thing I don't like is their guacamole.it's creamy almost like a dip and not my guac style.,2
Took my girlfriend's car in to have a previous tint job from another provider replaced and was very happy with the results. Kip cut the film clean right to the edge of the windows with no blemishes. On top of that the pricing was great. I will definitely be taking future vehicles to Kip and Shannon!,2
"We tried pho, stir fried noodle and fried rice with pineapple. Frankly, the pho is not as what I expected. I tried several better pho inside and outside this area. The fried noodle is pretty tasty and the fried rice with pineapple is ok, but not a Thailand style. Actually, I prefer to giving it a 3.5 which I believe is more reasonable.",2
"Nice clean restaurant, I have had the club sandwich twice and the portion is really filling and really very good and the service was very pleasant as well. This visit a 5PMer onn Friday, I was brought a bowl of fresh popcorn before ordering thought that was a pretty funny but nice touch. They also have a special with a pint of beer you get a platter of free nachos.",2
"How many beers on tap? Amen. Come here to expand your horizons and then hit Lee's for your supply. Tahi chik wings are I still havent tried the mac sleeze to this day, mostly because im afraid of having a heart attack on the spot, but it's definately on my bucket list. Actually everything on the happy hour menu is pretty darn good. Poke stack, and thai chik pizza are my fav.",2
"I came to Vegas for The Super Nationals Go Karting Event which was in the Rio parking lot. I got a good view of the race track too nThis was good for a few night stay. The rooms where nice and clean. And restraunts were only okay. But I enjoyed my stay watching the race and having the Starbucks in the hotel. Overall, a HIGH 4 Star review",2
I really wanted to like this place but maybe I had my hopes set too high. It was clean and the employees were friendly but the food really lacked for me. I definitely did not feel like it was fresh and delicious. It felt like heavy smothered mexican food. It was salty and the shredded chicken was greasy to top it off. I doubt quite seriously that we will return. I would much rather have Chipotle.,1
"I tried this place because of a Groupon and FELL IN LOVE with Jamie Ford! Okay, I just had a baby and she made my hair look like that's all I cared about! I even went back a few weeks later to go a little more funky, and guess what? I love it even more! Jamie has got to be one of the sweetest, most creative, most caring stylist I have ever met. She even let me bring my baby along to our appt.",2
The pizzas my husband and I ordered were mediocre. They were pretty greasy and I had the impression they had been sitting around for a while and just heated up before they were brought out to us. I think this place is overpriced for the quality of food they serve. The waitstaff was attentive. I don't think we'll return.,1
"This is simply the best in the SW. It is not a stream lined Pho house like Jenny Pho just up the street, but full menu Vietnamese restaurant that has an attached drive thru! I think that if you stick just with Pho soup, you are missing out on what this place has to offer! About as authentic as it gets outside of China Town.",2
How did this place survive 4 years? If you want to pay 7 bucks for a small bowl of Pho or 6.50 bucks for itsy bitsy small 4 pcs of egg roll then you have found your place. The waitress was very cold and not welcoming at all. The broth of the Pho we ordered was the worst we have ever had. The pickles that came with the egg rolls were old. Save yourself some money and go elsewhere.,1
I saw one of the rudest bartender I've seen in my life. Bartender didn't shy to scream at patrons and it really bothering my drinking time with my buddy. She was making some racist comment to other customer. I wish i remembered to took her name. Establishment that hire this kind of bartender deserve a one star review.,1
"The reason for 1 star RESORT FEES! I used to stay here because the rooms were decent and clean, but now the resort fee is just ridiculous. MGM isn't charging this fee, so you can stay there for around the same price. Just include the resort fee in the room rate so that your customers don't feel taken advantage of.",1
"This place has messed up on my last two orders and it is always on the cheese sticks. The first time I got bread sticks instead of cheese sticks and this last time I didn't get marinara. I called back asking if they could bring me some. They were apologetic and said they would bring some right away, which they did. But it was cold!",1
"What is going on? Tonight out of rolls for Aarons sandwich, the substitute stale. Sheila BBQ chicken salad had the worst rubber chicken . You will lose customers if you serve that rubber chicken. Ick. This was a take out order. Just makes me doubt if I will return. Tell me something, it just seems to have expanded too quick and quality is suffering.",1
"Heaven! This place is awesome. The shop is nothing fancy but the donuts are delicious. We came here around 2am. The owner is very nice. We got blueberry cake, apple fritters, regular sugar donuts and raspberry filled. They were all delicious. They don't skimp on the jelly in the raspberry filled. The blueberry cake was my favorite. I will definitely be a repeat customer!",2
"The slowest service ever, place was almost empty, but it took at least 20 mins before I ordered. Then I had to wait another 20 30 mins for my order. They brought me food that I did not order. So, had to wait another 10 minutes to get a right sandwich. I ended up taking my order to go. Chicken was hard and dry. I will never go to this place again, worst service ever!",1
"The group they outsourced to for my moms kitchen has disappeared in the wind and it is sitting here unfinished. Lots of promises, payments made, and no results. The cabinets were crocked and had to be redone, the countertops couldnt be leveled properly, the tiles we not even and are chipped, there are holes in the wall and no plumber to speak of. This is 3 months of expensive ridiculousness!",1
"This place is perfect. Excellent soup, excellent smoothies, relatively speedy drive thru, friendly customer service, amazing soup. Everything I have tried there was very satisfying. Breakfast stuff is all amazing and not greasy. Their combos are great. I would go today but they are closed on Sundays.",2
"Was happily impressed! The decor is a little on the corky side, but the food makes up for it! Great rolls for cheap! The rolls are all 50 off all day and the other items are reasonable. I had the crouching tiger roll and will definitely have it again! The crab filled poppers are a must as well! Service was great, only down fall, it is way across town! But I will be back!",2
"We come here often since it's near our home.but the service is always great! The food is tasty! Get the VIP card if you can, it's totally worth the sign up fee. We go in on busy nights and get in quicker than everyone else, free Birthday 25 after you accumulate so many points you get another 25 free on your card.",2
"After 2 years in Madison, I finally made it to the Caribou. I ordered the Caribou burger with cheddar and a side order of cheese curds. The bun for the burger was mind blowing. I devoured my meal in record time and found myself planning my next visit. There are many great meals in Madison, and that burger is one of them. Cheese curds were not prize winning ",2
"This was my first time at Jesterz and I was impressed. They did a great job and I sure was laughing most of the night. There were only a couple ""skits "" that I did not think were that funny but for the most part I was non stop laughter. The crowd got asked a lot to give suggestions for the show. It was nice involvement. Garrett, Paul, and LaMar did a great job on stage.",2
"My wife really enjoys all the fancy drinks and things they have at a ridiculous price, and she even orders caffeine free drinks for our kids with some whip cream and chocolate. If you can afford it this place is consistent, and delicious,offering a wide variety of coffees, teas, and combinations of them.",2
It's really hard to rate this. Nathan the bartender was really nice and professional but I'm assuming who would be the manager was very rude and unprofessional yelling at employees in front of customers. Made me really uncomfortable. My food was great Nathan was great but John the Manager you should never talk to people that way let alone in front of others.,1
"Loved this place! I had a very last minute idea, and these guys made it all happen quickly, and the quality of the shirts were way better than what I was expecting. I will be back for another fun round of shirts, I could probably outfit my whole closet of custom shirts. Keep it up guys, so glad to have you nearby inTempe",2
Lots of new shops have popped up recently and i must find a day to go and explore as this evening evening there is no time and they are all shut! No suprise there! There is lots to explore here including the mush talked about drill hall which yes i still have to explore too! time is not on my side as the list of things to do just keep getting longer!,2
Love this place! Would give it a 5star if service was a bit better. Usually go here once a month. You can't beat all you can eat sushi for 25. Food quality has always been great. Not once have we had something we didn't like. Usually pretty busy. Always packed for lunch and dinner! It can get a bit noisy with all the people.,2
"OH. My god. Best waffles. Ever. I got the Breakfast Magic and it was indeed magical. A wizard must work in the kitchen. It was so good, I could have eaten the waffle plain and it still would have been AMAZING. Eggs, bacon, cheese, and green onions on top of a delicious fluffy and crispy waffle. All the breakfast things I enjoy served in one dish! SO GOOD! I highly recommend this place!",2
"Great place to come after a night out drinking. The pho broth is really good here, prices are decent and food comes out really fast. and the garlic calamari is awesome! Probably one of the best calamari's I've had. or maybe its the alcohol in me, but the portion was pretty big and the taste was addicting.",2
"Went in last night to check things out since new owners. Everything is just fine. The salon is still the cleanest one in town. I think everyone in there could be a little more friendlier and be more up beat, but the person that did my nails was nice and they look great. I also got a pedicure and turned out great to.",2
"I Luv this place! I am from NOLA.we go many times if we want to take the drive into the city and have never had one bad meal there! The bread is so good and I have to have the Beefsteak tomato with blue cheese! The pasta is great and we loved the fried alligator! We have gone for lunch and dinner many times and have always left full, satisfied, and always brought some home for later!",2
"I've had Freshii now oumerous occaions for breakfast. I work in uptown and need to pass it walking into work from my garage conienent location. The breakfast buritto and breakfast bowl are both pretty good. Personally, I think its a great and healthier alternative to it's neighbor McDonalds. Don't let the bad or so so reviews turn you away it's definitely worth a try.",2
"Jill Wax Appeal is amazing! Her professionalism, wax technique charming new space is comfortable clean and very inviting for anyone, men included. I have been waxing for years Jill is at the top of her profession, you will not be disappointed! nShe was flexible with my schedule and really appreciated it! nSharing her name with with friends family will be easy. nThanks Jill ",2
"This place was very disappointing for takeout. I ordered a garlic naan and chicken tandoori. It came in a small, under portion white box, but that was just the start. The chicken was yellow and pink on the inside no tandoor char marks, no complex flavors. The onions were raw and uncooked. Generally disappointing considering how good the photos look for dine in.",1
I ate at the Sahara location years ago and remember it being very delicious a nice menu of different items to choose from. Well a few months back I tried the downtown location and was truly disappointed. Food was not as good as I remembered and service was horrible. I don't think I will be eating at this location again.,1
"after living in this city for several years i finnaly gave this place a try. i wish i didnt. the food was just a greasy slob of mess. i got their burger, the ""famous "" one that they are know for. bleh. oh and the girls dressed like strippers before the song starts is really not appealing. if you wear white tank tops, have a mullet, enjoy coors light out of the can, then this might be your place.",1
"The food is FIVE STAR, but hey, they gypped us by giving us the little brother, the ""Signature "" Steak N Shake. This is like Steak N Shake meets In 'N Out.seriously. Pull yourselves together Steak N Shake and give us the REAL thing. Hey, if Portillo's can give us TWO full service restaurants, I think you can too.",1
"We've visited this little sushi place a couple of times and it's never steered us wrong. Our favorites Godzilla Roll, Cowboy Roll, and the Green Bean Tempura that was recommended by our awesome server, Phyllis! Great service, quality sushi, a great place you might overlook being in GV casino. But one of our favorites!",2
"The Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Egg topped with Green Chile Hollandaise was a WOW dish. Very attentive service. Personally the decor is nice but some of the ambience is stolen because you can see out on the Casino Floor. Minor issue, great food but as you would expect with a casino restaurant , it was pricey",2
"Ambience is open and airy outside by the huge pool. The music sucks. If you want to dance to nice typical clubbing music, this is NOT the place. Its cool to hang out with a bunch of friends. Get there early as in 930P at the latest. Drinks are typically overpriced as usual. this place needs to change their DJ or playlist.",2
"They deserve ZERO stars. My cooler has not worked in over 2 months. They refuse to replace ""we are out of coolers "" according to the driver and route supervisor. I asked if they were out for new customers. Route supervisor admitted they had coers for new customers. 800 number provides no service. Supervisors do not followup or return calls. Horrible company!",1
"Fun place to go when you need some old school gaming. It's called ""the Pinball Hall of Fame "" but I come for the regular arcade games. Serious fun. They have the original arcades of many classics such as n Mario Bros n Super Mario Bros n Donkey Kong n Pac Ma Mrs. Pac Ma nAnd many more. Most games are only 0.25 to play. Very fun.",2
"Best thing I ate here.ginger! And it was just regular, not the fresh kind either. Thoroughly disappointed w the lackluster bland nigris, heavy handed sauce saturated rolls and the awkward fake friendly service! Think other reviews pointed out their flaws already so I don't even wanna elaborate. Wish they were decent but looks like I'll continue to look for a good sushi lunch place.",1
"How is it possible that this show is so reasonably priced? A fantastic show that is worth three times the cost of a ticket. Murray is very personable, cleaver and in touch with his audience. The assistant, Lefty, is quite talented with slight of hand and his schtick added to the show's enjoyment. I highly recommend this very entertaining daytime show!",2
My new favorite nail salon. First of all their work was impeccable. Mai is an artist. The salon was very clean. Everyone spoke english and could hold a conversation and genuinely seemed interested. Her son Nick gave me an excellent pedicure. It was nice that there was no up selling. Very relaxing environment. Will be back. Thank you . Oh snd they are open late ,2
"I had a great time at Melissa and Luis's Bachata class! They really broke down the steps and took all questions. Although we are learning basic bachata, the moves work really well in the clubs and can be used to any song. They look very advanced even though they are simple. I look forward to trying one of their Salsa classes. I've heard good things.",2
Lady was nice and did a good job on my sons hair. My son is 6 and can be a pain in the butt with clippers. She was done in 10 minutes too! Only reason it's not a 5 star is because its just a haircut. No cleanup or gel or anything after. No water or cool amenities. Worth the 7.99 I paid after coupon.,2
"CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS! Our waiter Jamal creatively added a larger tip than written in. I've been going there for years but never had such terrible service wrong drink, slow service and I've never had fraud committed from Cadillac Ranch. I treated him kindly as did my lunch companions and am ashamed to have suggested this place for lunch.",1
"Zooks is delicious. They are soo friendly here and love to help you out with suggestions. I definitely recommend trying any of their top sellers 25 is what i got . The sandwiches are not huge, so if you are big eater.get a salad or another sandwich. One wish I have for for Zooks is that the egg yoke would be runny instead. That would be AWESOME!",2
"Gotta love this store. Almost like taking a trip south of the border. Authentic Mexican Bakery, frescas and a nice eating area with both the normal everyday burros tacos you see everywhere but with other goodies as well. Fresh flour tortillas and a good butcher shop and cheese shop. A great place to take visitors to also to get a taste of the Southwest.",2
2 stars for the deep fried pork roll n green onion pancake n cold soda. Shao lung bao had zero broth inside the dumplings. Broth within most important part of shao lung bao shanghai dumplings . Hot n spicy wonton were Tasteless. Ordered stinky tofu but never go it. Air conditioning was weak if any existed. Everyone was fanning themselves. Don't plan on going back.,1
"We went to the Lakes Lounge for a late supper. The restaurant was closed so we ate in the bar. We got 2 Bloody Mary's, the steak sandwich, and the fish and chips. Not quite what we had anticipated based on the previous reviews. There is a saying we have been learning since moving to Vegas and that is you get what you pay for. Well, we paid 25 bucks, so. Needless to say we won't be returning.",1
This place is probably my favorite store around us. I can always go here for whatever I need and i love that it's walking distance. They have amazing prices great deals and really cheap gas the only downside to this business is the time they close. Wish it'd stay open past midnight since that's about the time we get the munchies lol,2
"If you're looking for an artery clogger then you came to the right place, service is good and doesn't take long to get the food but sandwiches are falling apart and you have to scoop it with a fork, the whole plate is just a big mess, and doesn't taste any better then it looks, doubt ill come there again.",1
not impressed .for the price very little meat and and tasted disgusting. they heat the meat in microwave right in front of you which probably means not fresh.bread cut so so small and no greeting what so ever from the employee.looked at me like why are you here with no smile at all. i ordered a ruben and after one bite i threw it away. will never go back waste of money.,1
Great local pet store . Girls are always willing to help or answer any questions. They have their own brand of dog diet food that I get for my lab. So far she hasn't lost any weight on it but it's only been about 5 weeks . So we will see . Sometimes they will give you free samples of treats which is always nice. I still go like to order my supplements and large dog bones online.,2
"Excellent and Authentic Vietnamese. While the location is not the greatest, it's convenient to me due to my work location and it's quick and extremely reliable. It's a great healthy option vs many others in the area. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We have tried so many different dishes, all of which were wonderful. For the price, it's a great option!",2
"Let's start with the fact they charge me 1200 for a 900sq ft apartment, let's end with me breaking my lease moving down the street and saving 4,800 a year. Good job pb bell, keep up the good work. P.S. I really appreciate waiting in the office while you negotiate a car loan over the phone. Stay classy",1
"I am from Wisconsin. Every steakhouse in Northern Wisconsin looks, feels, and acts just like this one. So I apologize if my review is tainted. In summary, great meat, with little else. The service was average, the food in this case, the sides average, the atmosphere.ugh. I'll just wait to experience this.at half the price.next time I am visiting Wisconsin.",1
"Horrible! We went as a large group, men and women. The hassle and hustle begins at the door and does not stop till you leave. The place was nearly empty, but they hasseled us over tables and crazy minimums till we just threw in the towel and left. We had hotter chicks in our group anyway. We'll neeeeever return. 2 thumbs down for this spot.",1
"Land of the 20 bottle of Heineken. Yep, you read that right TWENTY DOLLARS. If I didn't need to drink that crappy beer to muster the mental stamina to keep myself composed amongst all of the crappy music and creepy men, I wouldn't have paid that. I've decided that this is where I am going to spend a lot of time if when I finally completely give up on having any faith in humanity and human decency.",1
"I'm definitely a fan of Nektar. I generally get the toxin flush with ice. While it is very good and serves its purpose very well, it is pricey. That's my only knock on the place. For a medium juice, expect to pay close to 8 bucks. I think a large is 10. I'd like to try a cleanse but they are also a bit pricey, 60 bucks a day. The staff is awesome and always friendly.",2
"I've only eaten there once. We shared a bunch of food but the highlight is easily the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. Dunk that sandwich and slip into bliss. My only complaint is that it is often too busy to get a decent seat. We've been shut out on a lot of First Fridays which is to be expected. However, it wasn't always First Friday.",2
"I have the most amazing chicken saled, made with a type of curry and fresh greens. The dressing tasted homemade and I capped it off with a chocolate truffle. My only advice to Chocolate Spice? Please make chocolate peanut butter truffles. Don't understand how this place could get anything less that 4 stars",2
"I recently had a chip crack in my windshield, and these guys were great, they helped me with my insurance company, walked me thru the conference call with my insurance company before we actually made the three way call to them, they tech came right to my place of business and was very friendly and did the windshield replacement while I was at work. No hassle really easy A ",2
Absolutely an atrocious experience. I was returning 2 floor mats. The wait there was over 30 minutes. There was only one station open. The rep was arguing with the customer for over 15 minutes. Just one customer! 15 minutes. The rep tried to call the supervisor. It took another 10 for the supervisor to come. No one would open another station to help out. Absolutely ridiculous.,1
"Let's face it, these places are not free. If you feel like you deserve to live in a place that is properly cleaned and maintained you will have to place a lot of work orders. Most apartments have managers who make sure the place is clean and well maintained. This is not one of those places. Filth and chipped paint is everywhere. There is no excuse. A 20 second slop a mop does not cut it.",1
"Top notch in every way vocal talent, the orchestra, the sets, the costuming, the theater structure, even the staff who worked there assisting guests. I cried, I laughed, I pitied. I have seen the show twice before but this was the best. Hard to improve on perfection, but there were nuances that took this production to the top.",2
"Went there on a Saturday night.paid 168.00 for 4 people. What a waste of money! Waited in line for an hour. The Kobe beef tasted like shoe leather, snow crab legs were frozen, wonton soup tasted bad, Chinese ribs were super fatty and tasteless, flan tasted like flem, bread was hard, pizza was gross, didn't like any desserts. I thought Vegas buffets were good and cheap.boy was I wrong!",1
"We we're walking along lazily the Annual Monkland Village Street Fair. A motley of food vendors with prevalence of equal denomination, both food trucks and stalls we're available. We had the 'Classique' grilled cheese. I love paper thin pressed sandwiches. Just enough cheese and butter to summarize a great meal.",2
I came in expecting to be rolled out in a wheel barrel afterwards but instead I left with my stomach as empty as a hot air balloon. I swear the head chef downloaded the first recipes he found off of Google and used a starving dog to taste the food he cooked. The food was horrible at best. I would never come back here.,1
"Well i admit this place is Awesome nLove the Damn big azz burritos! nLove the Quesadillas with chicken or steak. nThe soft tacos and crunchy tacos or the best. nAnd the salad, uyyyyy the salad with the sauce is the SHET! love it. Yes the parking lot is small, but its worth the walk from the parking lot across it. The ladies there hook me up , cuz i speako El espanol, LOL nYes I'm Mexican damn it!",2
great little restaurant. portions of food were a bit small. and the food is slightly over priced. and the restaurant could use a bit more lighting. service was decent though the salmon and pork belly dishes were delicious though. this is definitely a place to check out if you're in edinburgh though.,2
"They have the worst system for taking orders and filling them. It took 49 minutes for us to get our food from the time we first got into their long and slow moving line. The orders seemed to come out one burger at a time and io particular order. Yes, the food was good but no fast food is worth a 49 minute wait. Next time we will go to In N Out next door.",1
Dr. Patty is a great person and was always great with my two cats. She has a great sense of humor and is very intelligent. Her and the staff are very friendly and always made me and the cats feel comfortable when there for a visit. I moved out of state and miss this clinic and would recommend it to everyone.,2
Food and venue were very good. Only to be surpassed by service. Related to restaurants out of 5 possible stars nVenue 4 nService 5 nFood factor 5 nOverall exp 4.75 Stars nDrawbacks A little expensive but everything for the most part was very nice. If I had to be super critical the ambiance could have been a little nicer for the cost.,2
"Stopped in for breakfast about 9 00 AM on a Monday. It was not crowded. The service was quick, but not really friendly. The food was typical IHOP tasty. The noise level in this place was awful. The music 50's music was so loud I couldn't talk to anyone or hear the servers. Made me want to eat and get out as quickly as possible, which I did.",1
My first time here during a week trip to Vegas.got a Miami Vice with Eyecandy was actually really good next time I will probably get extra shot s but for my first time it was good.it was a clean place with friendly.animated staff so seemed like a fun place to work.but hey they have alcohol around so.yeah haha.I have my half yard cup in my suitcase ,2
"This is pretty much the only mexican food place i eat at although it is alittle sketchy on the outside and inside too, it is the definition of a ""hole in the wall "" Amazing food , i genuinly enjoy it! styrofoam plates and plastic spoons tho? tisk tisk the staff is alittle weird but always very friendly! over all very good!",2
"This is my favorite Mexican place in Phoenix. It's a small place with seating for probably about 15 20. My favorites are fish taco, shrimp taco, chicken tortilla soup and quesadilla with carne asada. salad and burritos are very good too. Also, try the salsas the lady makes fresh daily. Once you try it, you'll be definitely going back. It's a little hard to see it driving by.",2
"Way over priced for quality but that's Vegas. Had to ask for the 59 early dinner menu server seemed to ""forget "" they had one . Corn soup was good, fish was an attempt to be creative but fell flat and dessert pineapple something was way too sweet and uninteresting. Service was good, better restaurants for the price. Chef seems to preoccupied.",1
"Found them on yelp, lacy was amazing. Color cut and style. Super attentive. Checked in to make sure she wasn't too rough, if I needed anything. Kept the conversation friendly and appropriate. Love my hair. Excited to see her back in Cali at their other location. Thanks again Lac, you made my birthday!",2
"My husband and I LOVE this place! We have taken so many friends here to introduce them to how awesome it is. It's a fun, simple atmosphere, casual but still nice. Food is amazing, tastes fresh and authentic. Service has always been top notch and we have been several times. In fact we're taking some more friends there this weekend! ",2
Was here in 2010 and it was great. So sad to see it go to shit. Too forever to get served. Ordered a local beer to find it come in a bottle it was not clear on the menu that it was a bottle and not on draft. Piano bar was pretty cool if you can make it there and have no rush or desire to be served with good customer service.,1
"Pour commencer, le personnel. Tellement antipathique qu'o'ose pas demander d'informations tellement on semble d u00e9ranger. Quand aux produits, vraiment d u00e9 u00e7ue! J'ai jet u00e9 toute la morue 1 kg parce qu'elle u00e9tait am u00e8re et immangeable. Sur 12 hu u00eetres achet u00e9es u00e0 prix fort, j'en ai jet u00e9 trois. je ne retournerai pas l u00e0, c'est s u00fbr!",1
"This restaurant is modeled after Chipotle, which we love however, we won't be back for a few reasons. First my kids did not like the food. They said the steak was tough. Second the price was too high. Lunch was 30 for two adults and two children with no drinks. The concept is good. I wish they offered better food for a smaller portion for a smaller price.",1
". I was recently sent an owners loyalty offer which seemed like a great deal. Any enthusiasm changed when I was told the extra 1900 in add on fees know as the ""Coulter package "". My wife and I now use it as a term, when a company is trying to squeeze us. Husband Hey whats this extra fee from Verizon? Wife Their just trying to Coulter Package us.",1
This place would be much better if they could pick a style of food and stick with it. They are way to much like Cheesecake Factory were you have way to many choices. My advice is to pick something you do well and stick with it instead of offering everything from steak to pizza to sushi. They do have some cool offers for movie and a pizza during the week that might be worth checking out.,1
"Clean, knowledgeable, professional and talented. Everything I'd want in a tattoo shop. Got my tattoo from Rodney and I couldn't have asked for better. Not only is he an extremely talented artist, he made sitting through a four hour session a breeze Well, as much of a breeze as having needles rapidly inserted into your skin can be . I wouldn't hesitate to go back when I get my next tattoo.",2
"Had the opportunity to try the Ranchero Breakfast Sandwich this AM and let me tell you, it was fresh, delicious and one of the best Breakfast Sandwiches I have ever had. If you live in the area you need to stop by and try it. Everything is made fresh From the bagels, to the cream cheese! Looking forward to getting back soon!",2
"Don't go for Breakfast! It's like a cheap Continental breakfast from a motel that has been sitting out and getting hard. You will get a better quality breakfast from the Pyramid cafe, which is on the casino floor. The manager was nice enough to give us a refund and admitted that the variety for breakfast was very limited. Basically eggs, bacon and sausage old pancakes.",1
"I was excited to visit the local Harley Davidson dealer and found the facility really nice. Lots of bikes to see. However, I felt like I was bothering the employees when I asked to purchase some parts. I got my parts, but really did not like the personal. When will businesses learn about customer service?",1
Flamingo upgraded rooms are pretty nice. The location is perfect since it's in the middle of the strip. The casino is just okay. Not alot of great restaurants or attractions in the hotel but once again being in the middle of the strip it's easy to get somewhere for a good dinner or show. The price is best your going to get on the strip unless you stay at somewhere like the quad.,2
I gave this place a try and the menu is an exact carbon copy of crappy Roberto down to the bland taste . I believe this is own by Roberto and they decided to have another shop in the Main Street and changed the name since Roberto is right around the corner. I'm not coming back here since I not a fan of Roberto and yes I had really good Mexican burrito before and Roberto is crap.,1
"This pharmacy has HORRIBLE customer service, never have prescriptions in stock and they obviously don't care that they constantly lose business. My doctor called in a prescription here when it was supposed to be called to Walgreens. I called tonight just to cancel a prescription and I was told to call back tomorrow after 9. My advice is switch to Walgreens or another pharmacy chain.",1
"The previous comments are spot on. No parking, horrible management, drug dealers and nasty ppl having Alex in hot tubs. Management does not care Hannah and other blonde manager are rude and act as if ur an in convince. Why is it still fairways the gold course it looked over is dead and smells. Can't wait to get outta here.sleep with a gold club near ur bed",1
"I bought a groupon and called, emailed multiple times. It took a lot to get a response and when I did, they were booking 2 months in advance. Thats ridiculous. Who can pre plan their schedule that far in advance and if you did have to cancel, wait another 2 months. I had to get a refund because the response was so bad.",1
Went for lunch the first meal came out after 10 minutes the next meal came out 15 minutes later. The chicken was lukewarm and after eating some it just didn't taste right. Nasty burps for a couple hours followed by bubble gut trips to the rest room. Will never eat there again. My co worker went home early with stomach cramps. Will never walk in the door again.,1
"I love this place and try to get here once a week. Dinning area is spacious and keep clean. Staff is always friendly and have smiles on their faces. Food is prepared fresh to order, the flavors are great, the portions are good and price isn't bad. My personal favorite is the spicy chicken plate with brown rice and green salad.",2
"Love this park. Something different from the typical blue and red play ground equipment you see everywhere. It's like a little town for kids and great for pictures. If you don't like watching and paying attention to your kids this is not the park for you because there is no gate and lots of places to roam. So it's perfect for us, we love it!",2
"The front desk staff were super pleasant to greet me as I walked into the hotel. The rooms were extremely clean and newly renovated. Also, the breakfast was delicious and the best part was that it's free! I met the GM Andi and she genuinely cares about her customers satisfaction. The hotel was very accommodating overall. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",2
This place is the best Thai Chinese food place on Valley View Rd! We went here with a group and could not believe how extensive the menu was. We each ordered a plate and shared it. There was even plenty enough to share with even more people. The service was great and attentive. They even have a bar inside. This place is open until 1am.,2
Well let's see where do I start drinks where like Kool Aid returned to get beer instead figured they couldn't mess that up. Sever was all over the place. Along with being on his cellphone when he was on the floor. This is a no no in my book. Customers first personal life second when you are working. The food was ok but not great. Then to top it off the manager didn't even care. Will Never go back.,1
Very good dive bar that can hold half the town. Good spot and it is only blocks away which make it my spot to go for a drink. I did go this Saturday though and it was super super packed with college age kids and was just not my scene. I will be back many times just don't think I'll go on the weekends unless I'm in the mood to be around a lot of people.,2
I would probably not book with Rio ever again. Although they have a lot of slots and decent restaurants the room was outdated and we got charged an additional 20 per person which is a resort fee. I know it's up to luck but dam their machines were tight not even 20. Service was okay nothing outstanding.,1
"Probably one of the most delicious breakfast spots in Madison, hands down. The bakery is is also amazing! Unfortunately they only take cash, so make sure to hit up the ATM before. Once you order one of the delicious omelettes or pastries you wont be disappointed! nThe sitting arrangement is shared community tables, which can make for some interesting eating partners but also good conversations.",2
"I'll expand on this after taking in a Sunday brunch. I popped in on a quiet afternoon and had biscuits, ribs and a pint. Right on the money. And do bow wow have a new destination for extended dog walks. I like it. It has a cool intimate vibe. The terrace will work but it'll never get sun. Definitely gets a follow up and brunch Extended report to come",2
"RUDE! RUDE! RUDE! I had a poor experience there and called the owner of my experience. I kindly explained my situation at his restaurant. I never got an apology, I'm sorry, nothing! I work for a five diamond restaurant and have never been treated so poorly, ever! Please do not support places that treat their customers like this.",1
"I just read two of the longest reviews I've ever seen online. People, this is a government office, not a blockbuster movie! I've lived in Las Vegas for almost 34 years so trust me when I tell you that this office has never worked better or more efficiently than under the direction of Debbie Conway. She has instituted reforms that were long overdue.",2
"Be prepared to wait. You will wait 29 mins to get help, 29 mins to get water, and 20 mins to have someone take your order. When you finally get your sushi it's not fresh. Oh and they don't serve sauces with their food. We would have asked for some but could never locate our waiter who barely knew his name. I would go as far to say this place sucks. Couldn't even pay me to go back.",1
New restuarant and a welcome addition to the South Side neighborhood. My wife and I enjoyed their fajitas and enchiladas. The Mexican beer selection was great. The service was prompt and the atmosphere was good for conversation. We were there on a weeknight which never seems to be too crowded here. This is a quality joint that I would recommend to anyone.,2
I love Thai and I love noodles so this was going to be a match. Fail. This review is for takeout only. Dishes were water slogged and had a sad bit of peanuts thrown in to keep it real. Tore our stomachs up and threw away remaining food. Guess the stomach of a college student is more forgiving than us old farts.,1
ROACHES! All that needs to be said. I loved this place. Stayed in Feb 2014 twice. Good price appeared clean etc. Just ran for my life today 11 23 14 because my partner woke me up having killed 2 roaches. Thought she was exaggerating then she woke me again to watch a huge roach crawling in the bathroom. I checked out asap. I got a refund. Added pics.,1
"Yes, they do have 1 craps. The problem is, if you've ever played craps, you can't make proper odds on a one dollar bet, so they are really just taking advantage. The crowd here is a sad and drained one, and I would recommend staying clear. Yes, the drinks and gambling are cheap, but you can find a good deal further up the strip with a much better vibe. Stay away from slots of fun.",1
This club sucks so bad. Supposedly I went on the best nights and it was literally dead in here. Drinks at the bar was good but the music is Terrible! Nothing but EDM and no Hip Hop. I believe clubs will never play as much anymore due to the hype of EDM. Their layout is just like Tryst only difference is XS is a lot bigger and doesn't have the 90 ft waterfall.,1
I FOUND A COCKROACH AT THE SALSA BAR! Do not eat here. They acted like it was fairly common to see a cockroach in their establishment. I had to wait for my refund because it was on a card and no one even went to the bar to replace the salsa or even clean the bug. I normally don't review chains like this but I had to let my fellow yelpers to avoid this dirty place!,1
"The Dagwood club salami, ham, turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo.I got pepperjack cheese Bread soft,fresh nMeats good quality nVeggies well they are veggies Overall a good solid samich, I hear the Archie deluxe is the thing here, ham cream cheese? Avocado n bacon bits? On a kaiser roll, hmmmmmmmm nMaybe if I'm feeling really adventurous next time!",2
"Best bar food in the Henderson area! All the food is delicious mozzarella sticks, mashed potato bites, pretzel bites, meatballs, sliders, French dip, nachos, wings, club sandwich, Remedy's chicken sandwich, burgers, steak and eggs. everything we've tried has been delicious Emily and Janna are excellent servers.hang out in the high back chairs over by the tvs to catch them",2
"I've eaten here before and it was okay. We just had take out delivered tonight. We had 3 cheese steak sandwiches and fries. No complaints on the fries, but the sandwiches were extremely dry. We're talking you couldn't even swallow your bite without drinking water to wash it down. Very disappointed and would not recommend.",1
"This is absolutely the best pub in Phoenix! The entire staff is wonderful, the beer selection is awesome and it changes, the prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is perfect. If you're like me and sometimes yo just need to not be in phoenix go to the rose and crown, it almost make you feel like you live in a real city",2
"Went to this little diner in a strip mall for breakfast. Honestly, the price was a bit high for the quality. I ordered the eggs benedict. Apparently the cook didn't realize or didn't care that eggs benedict isn't a hard boiled egg on top of canadian bacon and an english muffin covered in hollandaise sauce. Much better places to eat nearby. Go elsewhere.",1
"Horrible sauce, pizza was burn and service is very poor. nAll items are overprice for the poor quality you get. nThe service two thumbs down. I used to live in New York and you get really good NY style pizza for half of what I paid here. I don't mind paying the price but give me good quality food and service, on this day I didn't get either. nI'll not return to this place.",1
"This is an okay hotel, but there are others that are cheaper that are much nicer. I'd rather pay the extra money and upgrade to a better place. True, the rooms have small kitchens, but I wasn't in Vegas to cook, so I didn't use it at all. Also, I got a smoking room instead of a non smoking, so that wasn't happy times. There's free wifi, so that's a plus.",1
"Inquired about an oil change promo I heard on the radio, also have a check engine light on dash. The oil change special is for 10 off or is actually 21.95 after discount. The check engine light they said would require a diagnostic charge of 99. That to me sounded excessive, given many places will do it for free or low cost.",1
"It's such a relief to have an auto repair shop you can trust and rely on, My father counted on them since early80' s and when Alzheimer's invading him they showed patience not found in most businesses,when I lived out of neighborhood tried others for convenience that left me quite disappointed,so I'm confidently having Sandys for all auto repairs and recommend them",2
Was strongly thinking about getting a membership here being that it is very close to my house. I have been a golds member in the past. was really not all that impressed with the facility. the customer service was terrible i honestly felt like i was buying a used car! I think im gonna save the money and work out for free at Nellis AFB and just make the drive over there instead.,1
I really like this place and would definitely come back. I had a blueberry martini that was dreamy and for dinner I had the halibut entree which was also very good. Their wine selection is very good. I did have a glass of wine too because someone ordered a bottle of wine and I felt compelled to help him out And from what I remember the service was also very good.,2
"When I was there, my friends and I actually watched a break up in action. It was pretty sad. Aside from that, it was a great experience. I love their drink menu. Lot's of fresh great options. I had spice tuna rolls, and they were also very yummy. This is a definite go to place with the ladies for saturday afternoon happy hours!",2
"Not a fan. As far as pizza goes there are a bunch of options in Verona, especially south side, and the pizza hut is mediocre and overpriced. It's not horrible, but I only order from here when I'm too drunk to care about quality. Everything you eat from here leaves a greasy film in your mouth. Like I said, when I do order from here it's because I don't care about the quality, I just want to eat.",1
"Oh really U haul. You guys have been charging my money from my bank everyday. It has been two weeks already. It's my hard make money too. But when I called, a lady said they couldn't help me about it. If you couldn't, who would help me about it?Terrible terrible. People should consider well before starting a business with them.",1
"Terrible.we have used this dry cleaner for about a year now and they just ruined a third item. We only went back this time because they gave us 100 credit for ruining our quilt and when I picked up our items today another one of my husband's shirts was ruined with the same red stain our quilt had only after being dry cleaned. we will never return to Tide, too much money lost.",1
"I had the chicken tinga and dogfish shark tacos. The tinga was packed with flavor. My companion had the chicken mole taco, and I have to say that's what I'll get next time. It was the perfect combination of heat and sweet. Victoria beer rounded everything off. Service was adequate. nIf you're looking for Mexican food off the beaten path, try La Santisima.",2
Best threading place in the valley she has invented her own device to help threading. Instead of holding the thread in your mouth they put it around a necklace. Way more sanitary than the other places great service great quality overall a fabulous place to go. The girls are very thorough when they see you. They have a stamp card too!,2
"what a joke. why in the world do i have to bring my car in for a quote for work i described. i dont need people to waste my time. all i wanted was a price and the guy here kept insisting me to bring it in. i will never give this guy my business. if the owner of the shop is reading this let me say this ""give people what they ask for and not waste their time """,1
Our second experience here was much better. We knew to stay away from the traditional fattier foods and stuck with healthier options. We had n Mussels appetizer n Stuffed mushrooms appetizer n Chicken flatbread n Salmo Scallops Everything had quite a bit of flavor and was prepared well. We would return again!,2
"BDUBs used to be one of my favorite places to go, especially on Tuesday nights with my boyfriend. But recently, service has been slow and prices have gone up. Even though the wings are now ""bigger "" I am not sure if it is worth the extra 20 cents they added without telling us. I'd rather go somewhere else.",1
"Tuesdays are kids eat free! I had a great classic burger. Hand pattied chuck grilled to meduim with american cheese and the fixins. Served with a wedge salad with some great blue cheese dressing. Even the bun was great. It hit the spot. My daughter had chicken strips extra crispy, lol I guess she likes em like this. Served with the peanuts and the bread it was a great meal.",2
"I come here a lot because its close to home and they have a few good wing flavors, but everytime there is a problem, shorted us a bucket of wings, gave us the rest of the order wrong, they don't make orders you call in and pick up, apparently they forget they took them, I will continue to go here and never leave a penny for a tip",1
"The worst drive thru experience ever. It took over thirty minutes to get my order with just 6 cars ahead of me. Then, they forgot my drinks and I had to go back. 45 minutes later, my family got to eat cold fish tacos and cold fries. Yum! The employees could not care any less if they tried. Nobody offered up an apology for the slow service or any show of appreciation for waiting.",1
"I have only gone here a couple times but today was my worst experience. I told the receptionist and my nail tech exactly what design I wanted, but my nail tech was so rushed and distracted she messed up on my nails and she had to do two nails on each hand over again. I ended up resulting to a basic color with no design. I will definitely be searching for another place to get my nails done.",1
"Ok, the hours are bad. But everything else is great. The baristas are friendly and attractive . The coffee is the best I've had since Cuba this includes other Balzacs locations. Always a cool techie Tannery crowd, and usually dece music. Plus its got decor like a Parisian coffee shop. Like all their locations, Balzacs at the Tannery shines.",2
"It's got everything a great BBQ place needs great selection of meats always cooked to perfection, great tasting sauce, sweet tea, Mac n cheese, sweet potatoes and peach cobbler! Service is always friendly and timely. As a native Texan who lives here in the valley this is the best place I've found. The only negative is the location.",2
"I got the SanTan Sampler and the Texican. The SanTan Sampler gives you a good taste of different beers the Brewery has to offer. Phenomenal. And the Texican is very tasty. I went here on a Monday night, which apparently is MOVIE NIGHT too! I don't like Chandler very much, but I'll come down to Chandler for SanTan.",2
"For an all day dimsum in Las Vegas this is a must try. The carts are always moving. There is various types of good dimsum that they offer chicken feet, Chinese broccoli, dumplings and more. This is a must try place! Sometimes if you are waiting for one of the items though it takes them awhile. The service is ok.",2
"I COMPLETELY disagree with Tina. Kelly groomed my flame point himalayan cat yes they also do cats for the first time and did the BEST job! I asked for a ""lion cut with uggs "" yes I said uggs and I am SUPER picky. I will definitely recommend her and the facility to people bkz they unlike petsmart seem to truly care about your pet! ",2
"I think overall this place is more of a 3.5 stars. The Pad See Ew was not that great. Needs more sauce, the noodles were a bit dry. The green curry was delicious. The papaya salad was good, but I don't know that I'd get it again. The medium hot was a bit too spicy for me because I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy. I'd say the medium hot is a bit spicier than Serracha.",2
"Best service and quality of work! Dennis, the owner, is very friendly and inviting,he made my little black dress look new again. This is my new place for all of my alteratioeeds. I have been disappointed in other places with the quality of their work and it was so refreshing that the results was excellent workmanship! Love it!",2
"Went there this past Tuesday. I was very impressed with the decor as soon as I walked in. The service was outstanding to say the least. Then there was the food. I had the chili verdi. It was awsome, or as we would say where I grew up, wicked pissa. This is one place I will frequent again. And,I will be sure to pass the word on to my friends",2
"I agree, people just want to like this place. The food is . uh yeah whatever. The coffee is pretty horrible, even the espresso drinks. It's dirty and people want to like this place bec. they want to support independent business, feel cool, and be all boho hipster. The service is beyond bad, except for one girl who is remarkably cheerful and helpful. For her, I give Kiva Han the extra star.",1
"As a connoisseur of sushi throughout the world, I was blown away by the quality, presentation and over the top taste that I experienced at this restaurant. The artistic presentation of the sushi was the best I have seen anywhere as this is an art, not a science. I cannot recommend this restaurant more strongly and look forward to returning on my next trip back to Las Vegas.",2
"Worst service in Phoenix. Waited to be seated for 10 while the servers chatted. Once seated the server was so rude and cold. I'd have left at that point, but was with friends and they wanted to try it as they'd heard good things.they left unimpressed Food was almost unbearable it was so salty. This was the second time I've tried Switch and will be my last.",1
"The quality of meats is good here. The staffs are so friendly and attentive. Banchan is good especially the raw spicy squid. However,the bok bun ja ju Korean fruit cherry wine is quite expensive 18 for a bottle. The great thing about this restaurant is it open 24 hrs. So if you just finished working or feeling like have some hot soup after drinking.this restaurant is recommended.",2
We ordered the steak carpaccio for appetizer.wifey had filet mignon and I had the delmonico bone in rib eye. Our sides were cream corn with bacon and mash potatoes. nGreat meal great service.Steak was so good we didn't need any type of sauce the cream corn with bacon was really good.thank you for a great experience,2
"Before we arrived I was already calling concierge for help! They are so friendly! No matter where in the hotel you stay, at least where we stayed, it was close to everything you wanted to do, Pool, Gambling, Food. Easy access to across the street and the Shops at Cesars! Oh HEAVEN! And my newest addiction is the Craps Machine, Yes, Machine!",2
"It's the I Out that I had spent many years at during my time at UNLV. Many Animal Style fries and cheeseburgers later, I feel I owe it to the good folks of I Out to review them . And while their prices have gone up, I can always count on them and this location to provide me with some hot, artery clogging goodness. I Out you are truly in a class of your own.",2
"Spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a light rail extension that nobody really needs. For those who don't know, their plan is to take it up to metrocenter which will be a complete disaster if they even try. Ontop of that, they're spending all that cash and buses are breaking down left and right.",1
"I love this place. I never have a bad anything here. I know there are other locations, but this one is by far the best. Everyone is so friendly and the food is amazing every single time. I go about once a month on average and the entire staff greets me like I was just there yesterday. You cannot beat the price anywhere else and they have my favorite saki.",2
"Nice casual setting, booths outside, good burgers and salads, and now full and friendly service, what's not to like? Western burger with cheddar, bacon and lettuce and tomato top notch, though promised onion ring seemed to have missed my plate. Combo of regular and sweet potato fries well worth 3. Salads generous and flavorful. Root Beer is of note.",2
"Reasonable priced and my dinner included a drink which I opted for hot tea. I was really fond of the potato they had, however they have a decent amount of selection of food. They even had Sushi which was a surprise. Bonus points for taking amex. Only downfall is resturant is in a sketchy intersection.",2
This place was very disappointing. When AA Wholesome used to be located inside Super L Ranch it used to be lot better than this place. I bought whole bag full of bread pastries and only that was pretty decent was the custard bun. Others were pretty bad and bland and end of throwing them away. I just want some good Asian baked goods! Guess I gotta make another trip out to Cali.,1
"The service was great! However the atmosphere lacked, mainly because there were no TVs or music playing. The pizza was ok. The sauce was way too sweet for my taste. I couldn't taste the 5 toppings on my pizza it was so over powering. The crust was thick and delicious. Overall I had a decent experience, but I probably won't come again",1
Hartman and his staff are FRAUDS. I don't understand how they charge double then other eye doctors. Then they go and charge both mine and my spouse VSP insurance. When we specifically said charge only one. The worst experience ever. I don't understand how this place has such high reviews. It does not deserve it.,1
"We heard about Pamela's and decided to go the morning we were heading back home. The hotcakes are massive! I could have split them with my husband! Everything else I tried bacon, potatoes, coffee was just blah. But the hotcakes were yummy! Can't say I would go back. The prices were good but you get what you pay for. No cleanliness and rude staff.",1
The first time I have used Alamo after using other rental companies previously . Much better service and advice and no pressure selling of unnecessary insurance . Luis the agent was very helpful correctly advising a better car for a one way hire to Los Angeles . Didn't have to pay a one way fee either . Will return to Alamo !,2
"Like the good from The Dhaba. It's a little pricey. They occasionally have groupons which makes it more reasonable. They're very into having reservations. It's a small restaurant and when we've gone, their tables fill up. I do recommend calling ahead. The Faislabadi Aam Murgh is very good if you want to try something new.",2
"I tried this place the other night and was not disappointed. I ordered online which was simple ordered for delivery which was very fast, I ordered and within 20mins they were already there. GOOD FOOD great service. this will be my new wing place since me and my dad order wings at least once a week !",2
"One of my most favorite places in the world is Venice. So of course, the Venetian Casino is one of my all time favorite places to be at here in Vegas! I just spent the last two hours roaming the canal shoppes, and savoring the wonderful food. All the thrills of Venice, ""without the smell flocking birds ""!",2
"Absolutely atrocious since new management took over, do not park here. Every credit card reader was broken and there wasn't a sign until you were already up to the station. The prices have also been raised lately to unreasonably high rates. I will not park here again, and this used to be my go to downtown parking lot.",1
"one of the worst vegas buffets I have ever gone to in this price range. very rarely do vegas buffets charge extra during a sunday brunch for champagne.but the thing that hurts this buffet the most? the food. Although the styling is there, and the aesthetic appeal is definitely there, the taste isn't. and for this price? no crab legs? really?",1
"We used to go here a lot and service was always slow, but the other night service was horrible as we waited 5 minutes to be seated and another 10 minutes before leaving as we had not even received water or any interaction with our server. Very disappointed as their food was always good, but going to try something else next time.",1
my rental from this place was nothing but a nightmare. equipment broke down from the start and didn't work right all week. one of the worst customer service experiences of my life. i recommend you not to do any business with this company. Richard L.'s review has this place described just right. don't believe Carmen K.,1
we opened several accounts here at desert schools because they are a credit unioot a bank what i don't care for is the cold environment nthe staff are friendly enough and knowledgeable nservices will do the environment though is more cold than one of the big banking institutions i like they are local to arizona though so we'll stay!,1
"My t time was at 1130, after finishing the front in 3 hours I'd had enough. Waited 15 min. each hole, and the ranger could care less. The woman driving the beverage cart was rude and impatient. When I went to leave, n There was no attempt by any of the staff to see why I was leaving after 9. Just a poor experience and will not be returning.",1
250 dollars for a prescription of a drug I already knew I needed? The healthcare system is a racket. UPMC is part of the problem. And they told my insurance company the appointment was an hour which was a lie but it's not worth the time and effort to do anything so all I'm going to do is complain on Yelp and hopefully nobody reading this will support these crooks anymore.,1
"While I'm not normally a fan of Fox Restaurants, I actually found this meal to be very pleasant. I had a gift card so I took my fiancee here for Valentines day. We had the Butter Poached Lobster Jar and the 12oz New York Strip with a B u00e9arnaise sauce cooked rare . The lobster was quite savory and the steak was perfectly cooked with a nice hint of Tarragon.",2
"Great friendly fast service, wide selection on the menu, good food! Quality dishes inspired by the Southwest ol u00e9! , Midwest yee haw! , or just plain ol traditional breakfast. It's all solid. The meal itself didn't knock my socks off. would have appreciated a bit more seasoning. but it was more than decent! nI can see why my gramps comes here every week. Delicioso.",2
"It's Mexican fast I don't expect much. But overpriced. More than chipotle and not as fresh I think. This is my second visit, and maybe last? I got the nachos both time but I take most stuff off. Last time because I didn't want gauc they doubled my sour cream. Well this time I asked for a little more cheese, she charged me! I didn't get the gauc or beans lets not be cheap!",1
"This place is the most delicious food I've ever tasded. Every time I'm in vegas I'll pay a visit. Especially lamb barbecue. This place is great! I love the service, everyone should understand why the food is delicious? It's because they cook individually. Everything is fresh and delicious. Prices are great. I will highly recomend everyone. Go and you won't regret.",2
Worst service ever came into this store twice in the same week. Stood at the counter for about 5 minutes before the women slowly cutting paper with scissors or I guy messing with the label would even acknowledge me. They offered to ship my 1.25 package for 70 without giving me the option to ship it for 30 and it would arrive a day later. Go to UPS next door.,1
"Tried the pizza in the lounge area, was pleasantly impressed. I had the duck confit and date pizza, which also had soft gobs of goat cheese for a salty flavor. The crust was rubbed with rosemary and dark and crispy, just perfect, while the spice added a sweet flavor that was really special. All in all I was pleased with the experience and would definitely come back when I'm in the area.",2
Lunche Libre ! You now found a new stalker ! I was fortunate enough to live near two schools they stopped off at the past two weeks. Both times I had the Steak and Blue quesadilla. The Carne Asada was delicious and the combination of everything in it was perfect. I've had the Aqua Frescas in the past and they are a must.,2
We ordered Tom Kha Gah soup and Drunkeoodle. The drunkeoodle wasn't spicy at all and the soup didn't have any Thai curry in it it was completely white with no orange tint . Disappointing because we were looking for a good Thai place in Charlotte. The atmosphere was nice but the food was just okay. Very little chicken in both the soup and the Drunken Noodle.,1
"An absolute five star dessert place. Their custards are to die for! I LOVE their orange shake, mint chocolate chip snowstorm, lemon custard and nut parfaits. They have so many snowstorm options, you will definitely find a combination of your choice. They offer a different 'flavor of the week' every week. Of the ones I tried, found peach and peppermint to be super yummy!",2
"What a gem! I came here while visiting Arizona from CA and the store did not disappoint! There were tons of fun colors to choose from and the prices were incredibly reasonable. I got some chic summery shawls for 12 each while similar items in Barney's could go up to over 150 , and regret not getting this cute bag that was only 36! I will definitely go back if I visit again!",2
"Yummm. so happy I took my husband here for his birthday dinner. Took a cab to the Palms and went up to the top. The views are awesome so try to get a window table if you can. Service is very good. The food is amazing everything was cooked perfectly and had such wonderful flavors. It's a little pricey, but definitely worth it for a delicious meal with top notch service and views.",2
"what is this filth that i am eating? had it delivered . but whoops! forgot the rice. how do you forget the rice? anyhow, the peanut sauce was deplorable . it was literally the consistency of water, i could pour it down the drain and did. the panang curry was the same more like soup and less like sauce. this place is easily in the bottom 3 of thai places i have ever eaten at.",1
"Love love love this place! Hookah and cocktails! I can't remeber the whole night I was here, but from what i do, it was awesome! Chill, easy and groovey. I went there this one other night and I didn't like it because it got alittle bit to Mexicaney in there. Cowboy hats and Tejano music.lame. I think that was a wednesday.",2
Over 2 years later and their Brunswick Stew is still the best I've ever had. Their brisket is better than I remembered and I had the exact meal as before but without the ribs. Finally I grabbed a slice of Pecan Pie ala mode not homemade but very good! All in all I'd add another star if I could for the consistency!,2
Worst service and food I have ever experienced at McDonald's l have ever been to. Completely wrong order. Ignored at counter when trying to get corrected and even then wrong order and yet again ignored. You would think they would be sensitive on the third time retuning to get a complete order. But no. And then ignored the fourth time when asking to get access to the bathroom.,1
"Not going to lie, was not super impressed. Used a yelp deal for breakfast, the lady who took our order then walked back and made the food. Feel like I could have made the food better at my house. Probably won't be coming back any time soon. Obnoxiously playing spongebob on the tv extremely loud, even though there were no kids there.",1
"One word, national. We had such good service from national rental, so I'm making sure i'll sing my glorious praises for them. They didn't make us wait for more than one minute, as soon as we pulled in, they were ready to take the car, as if they knew we were late for our flight. Thank u, National Rental Car, tile we meet again!",2
"This place is worth every penny. You get to experience Vegas without mobs of people downstairs in the casino. The restaurants are pretty good, the decor is beautiful, and the conveniences are superb. What really made our experience is the customer service everyone, from the bellhop to the security, was super friendly and helpful. I really appreciate that.",2
"To begin, our server Brent was phenomenal! The dedication to attending to customer needs was outstanding. This is our favorite place to come to any time of the day, and enjoy the food and good service. Compliments to the chef for awakening our taste palettes, and to the staff for making the dining experience welcoming and great! See you next time when we visit from California.",2
My kid wanted to go here for her birthday so that is where we went. Jason was our server and was by far the best one we have had in a while. He was proactive and very attentive with a great personality. The food came out properly cooked and had flavor which is what one expects from a chain but doesn't always get. Definitely a great experience here.,2
"Like what they say the place is really clean and the waiters are friendly and courteous. I finally found my cravings for Vietnamese egg rolls called Goi Cuon. My wife commented, ""I like eating new kinds of food with you! "" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish 4.99. The servings are just right and enough.",2
"According to their menu, this restaurant not this locale of course was the inventor of the margarita. If so, they still do it right here. Flavorful and strong without being too overly sweet. Their chips and fresh salsa is very enjoyable and try their steak nachos as well. They are filling and worth a try. Service is friendly and I'll be back here for happy hour my next trip.",2
"So much has changed since new ownership. The staff is friendly, efficient, and plentiful. I'm basing my review on two trips over the last year for a special event known as Bearracuda. which has been a spectacular big mess of fun each time I've attended. The owner of The Rock seems like an extra cool dude, and I applaud him for his improvements to the bar. Also booze dirt cheap. Woot.",2
"In my top three dining experiences! Had the 36 hour short rib, which was to die for! Tasted the risotto which was light? And tasty! The tables are not right on top of one another, so you can enjoy your company. The service was on point but not over bearing. Desserts were also lovely. Top to bottom Sage is a stand out among many in Vegas. I will be back!",2
"Food was quite good but service was poor. Food took way too long for simple sandwiches and burgers. I enjoy the side salad. Chicken panini was good, burger smelled good, and saw a BLT E go out which looked great. At the end, I just couldn't get over the bad service. We had to take our check to the bar to be ring up.",1
"I really like to give locally owned businesses the thumbs up, but I cant here. This family had their kids working here none older than 9 or 10. I'm glad they are letting them help and teaching them work ethic, but my burger looked and tasted like a kid put it together. The place was dirty and poorly kept. BUT! There is potential here All it needs is a little adult supervision.",1
"Funky atmosphere, overpriced half ass food. I will not return to this place. Their serrano ham taste like cheap prosciutto! I understand they are not a traditional tapas place, but the shortcuts they take really shows. All their ingredients are really cheap. Their hot foods were served room temperature. Service was poor when the restaurants was only half full!",1
"Ok it looks like my yekp specialty is reviewing restaurants in airports. What i like about this place is its non chain feel, and the fact that while you're there you forget, maybe for just a few moments, that your in an airport terminal. solid bar food, I've had the buffalo tenders and the burger. I think they measure their shots makes fof weak drinks , so stick to beer.",2
This place thrives on a circus atmosphere rather than good food. Apparently local celebrities are meant to make up for dull food. A boring over priced menu boasts big European flavors that end up blah. Don't buy into the hype. This is a has been kinda place. The only good thing I had was the stuffed squid app.,1
Good food but you can get that in other BWW. Waited to be greeted for 6 minutes the host came out from the back chewing gum still talking to other crew members. I had called in the order and was told it would be 15 minutes I got there in 20 and had to wait anther 15 minuets. The BWW in tempe definitely out ranks this one. over unhappy with this store,1
"No wait on Monday AM about 9 30. There was a decent breakfast spread, enough variety to get your 10 worth. We lingered so we could try the other areas Asian, pizza and most importantly, the DESSERTS! and it was all delish and fresh! We will come again! The hotel itself is gorgeous oh and they have the Airplane! slots only the best movie ever ever ever! ",2
"I am a big pizza and wing fan. Its by far my favorite food. And this is my favorite place to get them at. Their wings out the best ive had. No where can beat them. Their pizza is good, not great. But it goes good with the wings. You can get beer here too. They have tv's also inside. Great spot especially if youre looking for some wings.",2
"This place is an A W Long John Silver's combo store so all your french fries taste like fish. They do have root beer on ice cold tap. Some of the items on the menu are ok, but most of time I leave disappointed. They do have a jukebox and lots of comfy boothes but its still fast food its fish burgers. Not the best but if your intoxicated it'll do.",1
"This is the most outdated and dingy major city airport I've ever seen. I was shocked that such a large beautiful and clean city has this to offer as it's first and last impression. CLT is begging for a major renovation! The location, however, is stellar. A super short jaunt to the metro area. They also have a Cinnabon and that counts for a lot in my book.",1
"A fantastic establishment with both creative and signature dining experiences. An excellent drink selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages, and friendly courteous staff. I can't say enough good things about this establishment. I have eaten there half a dozen times already and have been more impressed with each meal.",2
"This Amtrak station is ieed of a face lift! It is very dingy and outdated looking, which is surprising because it is underneath one of the most prestigious address in downtown Pittsburgh! nThe employees were friendly and helpful, which was nice, and our train came on time which is really the most important thing!",1
"Don't miss this restaurant if you are visiting Montreal or are fortunate enough to live there. You can't go wrong and you'll get a real taste of the local culture. They serve some of the best meat dishes I've ever tasted, and the service is friendly and impeccable. If you can't get reservations, go early, as it's almost always packed.",2
Had a great experience here. staff was friendly and place was clean. Food was good for a cafe. MTO Fried Chicken Steaks special was good. Claim chowder was okay won't order chowder again. MTO Donuts was good but little pricey but it's good when it's nice hot. I would commend this place if you are looking for a nice sit down cafe.,2
"If you like ribs. Keep walking. Seriously, the most bland and boring ribs on the planet. My date had the ribs and she chose to go hungry rather than finish them. I had the chicken and rip combo. I gaged down the ribs, and my mouth does not produce enough saliva to ever make that chicken juicier. I gave them one star because the chicken corn chowder was not bad.",1
"It's hard to get great thai food in vegas as we have a lot of good options. Komol however, stand out above the rest. They have a lot of vegetarian options and the servers really work with you to decide what would be best. I definitely recommend the papaya salad, it's delicious! Many more vegetarian options can be found on page 23 and do not hesitate to ask questions!",2
Money. That's the word I would use to describe this joint. A definite hole in wall with zero windows it's almost too dark to see your food. I had the deluxe burger with mushrooms and it lived up to the hype. Absolutely amazing burger. Only knock on this place for me is their fries are not that good. Go with the onion rings.,2
"Great casual good. Great service. Quaint place. Pleasant atmosphere. I love this place and highly recommend it. I just don't get some of these negative comments here. I've been there probably a half dozen times over the past couple of months and have not had one negative experience food OR service . If you don't like the prices, then all I can say is go to McDonalds next door.",2
"Salsa and Chips are HUGE.Great location, great waiter and seating staff and very good food. I am not Mexican but I eat Mexican food almost every week. The food was very good, cost effective, and the location is right in the middle of everything. Stop here and get a drink and an appetizer. We did this the night before I left but we should have went here sooner.",2
"This place was nice. I have stayed at Hyatt places before. It is clean and comfy. The outstanding part was the customer service. The manager was pretty helpful. They even booked a tour for my friend and I. The breakfast was not that great. It definitely had the basics bagel, cereal etc however their fruit was pretty blah. Would recommend this place. It's reasonably priced.",2
"I wanted to up my review from 4 to 5 starts because this is seriously my favorite restaurant! As I mentioned in my previous review, I am SO happy for the original menu to be back! My mother and I here weekly and we will continue to be regulars! The staff is great and food is the best! I also had lunch with my boyfriend here yesterday and it was so, so perfect that I enjoyed every second of it!",2
"My first time here and it was not bad. Actually, it was good. The menu has quite a selection. What I really like about this place is that you can pretty much try everything without spending a lot. This is perfect for people who are new to Japanese Cuisine. Service was not bad. The only thing is that this place gets busy and you may have to wait a while to get a table.",2
"Used to come here back in the day and glad to see it is still around. Love the food and the owners. Their Mapo dofu is the best I've had since coming back from living in Asia, and it's not even on the menu. They'll do things in Chinese style if you ask, or make it so it matches your idea of Americanized Chinese food which my husband likes . Still glad they are around and still awesome.",2
We started off waiting for 20 minutes. And plus the hostess skipped us. We got inside and the restaurant layout is too crowded and too small. Third they got my drink wrong. The food was good. Nothing too special. Its better to enjoy if ordered takeout tho. Fourth the waiter did not even check on us. We had to get his attention for a refill. Overall not a good experience.,1
"Parking for echo canyon pretty much sucks. They have blocked off a lot of the places you used to be able to park so it's kind of a hike to get to the trail, but I just try to look at it like it's a good warm up and cool down It's a pretty good exercise trail. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because it's super crowded which can be annoying.",2
"This bar is really pretty awful. Full of old men that clearly don't want you to be there, the pub like the customers is on its last legs. Old, tatty and dirty, this is one pub I won't be going back to. The client u00e8le are hostile, as are the staff. The beers are exactly the same as everywhere else. The interior and atmosphere are terrible. Don't come here",1
"Rude service. I called to place a delivery order and the guy that answered was less than thrilled to have to do anything. He placed me on ""hold "" and I could hear him complaining in the background to his coworker about having to charge a card. Finally, a girl picked up and I mentioned delivery and she said, ""of course you would "". Enzo's has lost my service, extremely rude.",1
"Yogurt was yummy, but their pricing is very deceiving. They have a large .39 oz sign, but it is really .45 oz. They claim it averages out to . .39 oz because when you buy 10, you get 8 oz. free. But that would only be true if you only got 8 oz. each time. They just need to be honest. It is .45 an ounce. Don't be deceiving! I give it 1 star for that reason.",1
"Looking for a specific magazine, or a specific book, be it fiction, auto biography or reference, they either got it or can get it. It's a nice way to spend a rather, cool and rainy friday night, sitting with my hubby, looking through the latest crochet today magazine, sipping on strawberry lemony iced tea, and listening to some good jazz over head. My idea of a fuight out.",2
"Service is very often rushed, perfunctory, assembly line and does not make a guest feel relaxed or comfortable. On several visits, the receptionists are curt, routine and give little attention to the guest experience. The services are just fine, with often chatty technicians, but serves is always fused as if they can't wait to get the next client in and out.",1
Our food was great and our server was awesome. Poor thing had to deal with a hungry table of 13 after Pat's Run. The manager was kind Enough to bring 5 gift cards to the first timers too. Great way to welcome new customers and bring people back. I'm so happy they were able to accommodate our large party. Thanks Gordon Biersch!,2
"I sat down at 8 30. They took my order at 8 50. I am sitting here writing a review at 10 10 with no food. The drinks took so long that I cancelled and got some from the bar. I would never go here again. After complaining they just told us to wait longer and that all their food was ""fresh "" so it would talk longer. I am thoroughly disappointed and would never come here again",1
Came for the food stayed for the music we came on a sat and jt douglas was playing and I must say he rocked it. The food is great only main reason we will come back is for the live music! Plus its a dog friendly patio which is al ways a plus. Service was ehh okay ive had better. Give a call ahead to see if they have live music im not sure if this band plays there every week,2
Village Tavern is my go to when dining in the South Park area. I've been going there for years and have always had a good experiences. Their hot crab dip never disappoints but most recently I tried their Miami Burger and spring rolls which were both flavorful and satiating. Service has always been good and you can't beat sitting back on their patio area and having some cold ones.,2
"The only reason to go to Palm. Walk past everything on the casino floor to the elevator up to Alize and take in the best view of Las Vegas while experiencing one of its best gastronomic performances. If you can snag a window table, and there are many, you will never forget the time well spent. Service is attentive and informed, wonderful wines, sublime menu, and a hearty check. Loved it.",2
"In case you don't know, Louisianne's has started serving lunch, The good news is that it is inexpensive and delicious. I had a cup of shrimp bisque that was outstanding, and the grilled chicken po'boy tasted very fresh the shredded romaine lettuce was much appreciated . The only bad news is the general ambience of the upstairs lunch area . . . rather dark and uninviting.",2
"The display and design of the store is perfect. More importantly, the gelato was bomb! They gave me a sample of the Salted Carmel and ""Game Over ""! I didn't want to sample anything else, I just want more Salted Carmel in my mouth! Service couldn't have been any better. The whole experience was perfect and I don't care to go anywhere else for gelato.",2
"Although I have only been here once while traveling the Vegas area, their price, convenience, and overall good quality food stood out to me. While shopping for dog food next door, I needed something for myself and noticed this little pizza shop right next door. I received two hurkin' pieces of pizza with a drink all for a reasonable price. It was finger lickin good!",2
"I usually go here to get my eyebrows threaded who ever says it doesn't hurt is lying, BUT ""beauty is pain "" and its worth it! I have been a few places in town, but this one is my favorite b c the girls are good, its cute, and conveniently located. They are steadily busy, but I have never had to wait more than a few mins so thats another plus.",2
"Made reservations weeks ago, showed up for dinner and they said we didn't confirm! Somebody named John remembered the reservation but the hostess told us on the way out that ""we should have "" made reservations? The restaurant is hot now but in a shady part of town. Maybe when they aren't the talk anymore they will consider treating patrons better!",1
"I give one star because the chairs look big and comfy but I will never go back to find out. Plain and simple.my boyfriend and I walked in and stood there while 3 employees stared at us and did NOTHING. It was a monday evening, we saw open tables, and not one of the 3 employees acknowledged us so we left.",1
"Literally the nicest, most sincere, excited employees I have seen working at a fast food establishment. Never had a problem with the food or drinks. The rest of it is an average Taco Bell, but every single time I go, even through the drive thru for a quick drink, the employees are the nicest people ever.",2
"Finally affordable, amazing pizza has come to Green Valley. Simple, fresh and simple ingredients. Crust that soft not soggy. Very friendly staff and 10 min for to go orders. I had the Roma and it was perfectly cooked and really flavorful. The dine in area was clean, colorful and comfortable. I will definitely be back.",2
"Okay I see alot of movies and although its very close to home I avoid this place and would rather drive to Rave or even South Point.on more than one occation i've experienced poor quality sound, unconfortable seats, dirty everthing, concessions not well maintained.if I'm paying 10 for a ticket then it may as well be worth it.I'll drive to Town Square everytime.",1
"I was not at all impressed, and certainly wouldn't recommend. The restaurant was completely empty aside from one other table that already had their food. The waitress was inattentive and the food took much longer than it should. The soup was extremely salty, and all of the entrees were over sauced and flavorless. I was hoping for a new regular Thai place, but this is certainly not it.",1
"A friend and I came in here. Ridiculously good selection. Ridiculously high prices. For a used store they have lots of stuff, but you will pay for it. They had tons of road bikes 30 years old, slightly higher than garage sale quality for about 200 way too much . Also, we saw a bike, and he said he had the same model. He got it NEW last year for 100 less. Just saying.",1
"One of my favorite burger places. Sweet potato fries were great as always, BBQ Bacon Char was superb. 9 out of 10 times I go, it's the best burger. However that 10th time every so often is unpleasant. I never know when that will show up, and it is still occasionally dirty upon sitting at a table. This is my favorite burger in the area, no doubt, no questions asked.",2
"Disappointing! They charged an extra 20 per night for services like coffee and water bottles. The fee was reversed after I talked with a manager and showed booking paper work. Another 15 minute chat. Pool closes at 7, even during summer. Multiple calls from security letting us know our door was ajar. It was closed and locked.",1
I want to start off by saying that Chinese food should not have YELLOW Rice! They do have good lunch specials and again this Chinese food wasn't very good. Still searching for a good Chinese food place here in Charlotte. The only reason why I tried this place because I was next to it at the time. Still searching!,1
"Lobster Tacos and Crab Fried Rice is filling enough for us and OUR very favorite.haven't tried anything else but know it must be good. They have great prices at Happy Hour. The service is first class and we never miss going when we are in town. They remember us like ""where everyone knows your name. nWE LOVE WILDFISH",2
Kim is the absolute best! Never met a store owner who made a shopping experience so personal. She cares about her customers and providing them with the most up to date styles and stays trendy. It's a great place for a mother daughter shopping day too. Kim is a huge supporter of other local businesses and is also a part of anything where she can help encourage other owners.,2
"My wife and I used Brandon's Photography for some graduation pictures of our daughter and they were really good. We've used a number of experienced photographers in and around Scottsdale during the past decade or so, and would have no qualms hiring Brandon again. Good service and great pictures. Well done.",2
Had an apt with jeremy at 330pm today got there early. No one greeted me but thats oki I get they are busy. Sat till 400pm and no one still said anything to me so I left. From pictures looks like they do great hair. Im going to have to search yelp again to find a salon that at least will acknowledge that im there. At Least they called me the night before to bring cash. Off to the mall I go.,1
They did a good job but I got callous remover and the nail tech got some on my leg and didn't notice and I didn't think anything of it because it didn't hurt at the time but then I get home and have a huge chemical burn on my leg. Hurts like hell. And I paid about 20 more than I expected to. Way to pricey and now I am going to have a scar on my leg. Thanks polish room,1
"Ate at the bar.place was hopping. Good food. No beer on tap but carried a lot of local selections. Thoroughly enjoyed it, had a couple of appetizers for dinner. Ahi tuna roll and black bean soup. Both were excellently done and well plated. The live piano entertainment behind the bar was very good as well, I'd definitely go back.",2
"In any other location, this would be a 3 star bar, but for Vegas and a hotel casino bar, at that , this place is wonderful. Tucked away down a west wing hallway, it gets little traffic and is relatively empty most nights. Bar service is very quick, and if I recall, drinks are a little less expensive than the bars closer to the casino floor.",2
"Amazing happy hour, great atmosphere, delicious food and wonderful drinks. I believe the only thing I could complain about is the fact that the layout was a little uncomfortable to maneuver around after a couple of drinks and walking in high heels, it was challenging to not bump into people's tables and chairs while trying to get to the other side of the restaurant.",2
"Decent food, the tortilla for the burrito is the size of a pizza crust. They ended up getting pretty busy and only had 3 people working and the order of service was getting confused. I watched my food starting to get cold as they had it staged to be wrapped. It was still ok and a good value but could of been a lot better.",2
"I looove their fries! I'm a shoestring fry kinda girl. I got the garlic parmesan wings and they were pretty good. Not much to complain about. good price, good food. Just the woman working the counter seemed a little bit too busy and didn't provide such great customer service. Everything else was good!",2
Turkey burger. Didn't finish it it was so bad. Garlic soy glaze edamame were sweet was expecting a salty garlic edamame. Wait they sprinkled it with salt attempting a savory finish. We should have just eaten by the pool. It's the same food and just as bad of service. At least by the pool you know what type of service you are going to get.,1
The cupcakes we're alright the icing I was not a fan of . The cream cheese frosting doesn't taste a thing like cream cheese frosting more like buttercream. There was also way to much icing on these cupcakes and I could taste the grains of sugar in the icing. If you want a great cupcake skip this place and go to Sprinkles in Scottsdale.,1
"I didn't like this place. Red Velvet cake is my favorite, so me and my boyfriend are always trying to find a good one. First of all, this place looks more like a boutique than an actual cake place. Second of all, the Red Velvet didn't even taste like Red Velvet. It just taste like a bland chocolate cake.",1
"Had dinner last night about 8 pm, surprisingly a short wait for our table. Started with cocktails. My wife loved the Pearfection. Simple dinner roast beef sandwich. Theirs is the best around always rare and tender. I had the 1 2 rack of ribs with a delicious creamy slaw. All food was prepared well. Menu is rather short, but menu items are done well.",2
"This was literally the worse buffet food I have ever had and really has no place on the Vegas Strip. The food was bland, poorly presented and of medicore quality. The line layout is inefficient and confusing and the dessert table was like something at a gas stations snack area. Not even worth it when its free.",1
"Made the trek out here from the strip in search of something tasty and non meat, and was not disappointed ! The salad tasted fresh and actually contained vegetables other than lettuce and shredded carrots which was what most of vegas had to offer . The quesadilla was simple but tasty. nIt was well worth the trip from the strip to get something reasonably priced and fresh.",2
Pretty tasty food for a pretty decent price. 3 1 3 stars is more deserved but they get the benefit of the doubt on this one. The environment can get pretty shady in here after dark so I would recommend going during the day. In fact the good food and the price point is the only thing that carries this place past 1 star so don't be shocked if you don't consider it better than a 2 star joint.,2
This is a very shady operation. I hired GAD last summer to put addition on my patio. They have been back over 10 times and the job is still not done and now they will not come back to fix it. Mike will give you the runaround as if he has nothing to do with it. Mark couldn't build a square box let alone a roof. Stay away from these con artists.,1
This place is quite hidden or shall we say secret. We couldn't find it for a while because there is not a sign. They have a variety of pizzas that they serve by the slice for 5. I came away impressed with the pepper and sausage pizza. If you want to get a quick affordable meal at the Cosmo. Go a quest to discover the location of secret pizza.,2
"I got the strawberry cupcake made with real strawberries. Loved the frosting it was light and yummy with strawberry flecks, the cake part was a little dry but good. Also got the chocolate with chocolate frosting. Very rich and yummy! It's cool that there are so many other choices like shakes and macaroons. have yet to try them.",2
"I love chinese food. I LOVE bars. I was really excited to try this place today. First, let me compliment the staff. VERY NICE PEOPLE. GREAT SERVICE. Sadly, The food blows. Blows may be strong. Its just beyond average. This place is like Panda Express but with a cool bar. I don't think you can call this place Gourmet Chinese.",1
"I have lived in Charlotte since 1984 and never been in this store. Today, I had some time and popped in. Loved it! The items in the store inspire gift buying. You will be thinking, ""Oh, so and so would love that! "" I think this store is a must visit. Then when you need an interesting and unique gift you will know where to go to get it.",2
"My daughter and I went here after seeing they participate in the Upromise dining program. The pizza was fantastic! So happy we found this place. The healthy choice, cheeseless pizza with lots of veggies was delicious. They even have gluten free crust. My daughter had a serious cheese slice and she loved it. And, the prices are reasonable.",2
"Amazing pizza. If your looking for the pizza with the most tasty crust, this is the place. I thought I died and went to pizza heaven. I will be back again and again. I had only two slices and a drink and I was full. Prices are wonderful too. I got my 2 year old some pasta and meat sauce and that too was incredible. Seriously you need to go!",2
"I've eaten at PoaF plenty of times, sometimes multiple times in a week, and it is always great each visit. Hands down one of the best BBQ joints i have ever had, and i lived in Georgia for a little while. Going to head there this week to pick up a couple bottles of their BBQ sauce for some homemade fathers day ribs!",2
"I will say, now that I have been back to Shotgun Betty's a few times and gotten to know the crowd staff I am a fan. I still don't swing by Betty's much at night, but it has become a favorite for a bloody mary or a margarita during the day. Also, I enjoy the music selection during the day versus night.",2
"If you love Korean food, you will not be disappointed! The hot tofu soups are so good and served piping hot with your choice of spiciness. Their galbi ribs and bulgogi are authentic and as good as it gets. My son loves their pork katsu, which is served with rice, salad, and potato salad and the servings are huge! We are regulars and bring visiting family and friends frequently. Great place!",2
"My mom and I just had lunch at this establishment and we found a cockroach in her chicken curry. Our server blamed it on the fact that they had sprayed for bugs the previous night. Regardless, if the food was stored properly and the restaurant was cleaned properly, bugs would have had no chance to come in contact with our food. BEWARE!",1
This is my favourite spot to watch a movie in Montreal as it is close to my place and usually shows the best movies. The concession is pretty good although in other cities like Calgary I find the options to be better. The theatres are comfortable and the screens are large. No complaints and I will continue to watch movies here unless a better theatre opens up.,2
"Fabulous breakfast place. We wanted a good, local breakfast brunch place away from the madness of the strip. We found this and loved it! The food was great, as well as the service, not to mention the price was right! Tip servings are large enough that you may be able to split though they do charge a small fee for this .",2
"If you haven't been fortunate enough to experience Paymon's you are really missing out. The Food is great, the atmosphere is laid back and relaxing, and the service is always top notch! Oh and don't forget to stop by the lounge. A wide selection of Hookah and some really interesting Speciality Cocktails. Paymon's is always a great time for me and my friends!",2
Late night Madison is tough when you are hungry. I saw that this dive bar was packed the night before so we stopped in on a Sunday evening. The few patrons in the bar were playing metal at full volume. We all had the Packer Burger which was a big MEH. Not the worst place I have ever been but I have been to some dumps. I would not seek the Packer Inn out in the future.,1
"Found I Clean Carpets on Yelp. Rob answered his phone, set appointment. Showed up EARLY to do carpets and couch. I found Rob to be very knowledgeable and straight forward. The price for the carpet and couch quoted was what I paid. NO UP CHARGES. Rob did a fantastic job and I will be referring him to my real estate clients.",2
"Bad, bad , bad! The burgers tasted frozen, the fries came out cold . The atmosphere was amazing but the quality of the food is some of the worst I have ever had. The allacart menu runs the ticket up. Which would be perfectly okay if the quality of the food matched it's price tag. 50 dollars later we couldn't believe we were paying for what we just had.",1
"I bought a groupon and spent 3 weeks trying to get them to schedule with no response. I called and they said groupons were only allowed to schedule via email. They would not answer my emails and each time I emailed them I had to fill out the same extensive form. Forget it, it is not worth the time and frustration",1
"Very impressed! We ordered crab Rangoons which where plump and full of filling. Lots of crab , a little more cream cheese would have made them the best ever! Chicken satay was also great! We also ordered the pad Thai which was decent although it lacked flavor. I will def order from here again though!",2
"I am picky so here's my review. The scallop appetizer was very good as well as the fois gras. The salad we had lacked much flavor but was really fresh. The rabbit, which was highly recommended by the waitress was just ok. Atmosphere outside was pleasant and inside was grandma ish. Overall a good meal but not sure if I would return.",2
"They have bagels blandwiches.someone pass the rooster sauce! Stale, flavorless, dry overpriced bagels. Weak ""shmears "" as well.they need to double or triple the portion size of the ""shmear. "" What really pisses me off is whenever I leave, my clothes reek of the place for the rest of the day.I don't get it? I actually use to like Einstein Bros years ago, now they are dead to me.",1
"I have taken my vehicles to Desrt buick GMC, now known as Autonation for many years, to get serviced. nWhen I go, I only deal with Mike Zibell. He is the best! Knows my cars, knows my wants and needs and always does the job to keep me, and my family not only satisfied, but safe. nI wouldn't trust anyone else, nor would I trust any other shop.",2
"seriously the only place i'll take my car io matter what issue. their customer service is awesome and they are honest. it's so hard to find a place that won't try to rip you off and try to sell you on everything and anything, not this place. oil changes are super fast and Mike, the mechanics guy, is awesome and HONEST. they definitely earned a loyal customer. THANK YOU.",2
"LADIES you ever need your car fixed and have no idea what is wrong? Go to Gil's Automotive. Gil and his staff will let you know what needs to be done, how much and how long it will take. Plain and simple honestly and professionally. If someone told you something needed to be fixed they will let you know the truth. I can't recommend them enough.",2
"Parking is impossible. They should Pay you to wait for a parking spot. The Mall management must be nuts! They tore down a parking lot to add more store, when one can't park Now! News flash outlet sale items are crap, not the same quality as an item found in Dillard's or Macy's. The junk is made just for the outlet. No sit down restaurant. Stick to the sales at a real shopping center.",1
"I did not feel like cooking on Sunday, I tried to call a different Chinese restaurant but they were not open. I remembered years ago ordering from here. nthe delivery was fast, the food was very good. nI had the Sesame Beef and it was delicious and the Beef Chow Mein was also very good. They gave me two free egg rolls. nI probably will order from here again,",2
"Great food, huge menu fast service. There is almost never a wait. The staff is always super friendly, enough staff on weekends which seems to be a problem at most good breakfast joints. The protein pancakes are amazing! I do wish they had buttermilk as an option though. The food is always really fresh, fast and there's a great selection for everyone to enjoy.",2
"The food is good, but it is very annoying that they will deliver to my house some days and not other days. Your delivery range is 3 miles and grub hub says I live 2.8 miles away, mapquest says 3.3. Either way I think its close enough. Don't be jerks and deliver me some damn Asian food when I want it, not just on days when you have nothing better to do.",1
Went into Zombie Zone to get an appraisal on some movie memorabilia. I had no idea the value and both the owners were fantastic in helping me out with pricing. They went as far as hooking me up with a regular customer of theirs who bought all my stuff for a fair price. Great people to do business with! Really appreciated the help!,2
Staff needs proper training. Had multiple charges to my card and was not told beforehand. Made multiple comments to hotel concierge about addl charges. No comps for hotel guests to the club. requested late chk out but was bothered by housekeeping 40 minutes before chkout and was asked exactly when we would be out of the room. Will not be returning to the SLS.,1
"I tried to purchase a particular beer and I was told that they would not sell to me because I'm not a ""regular "". I would've very likely become one if I'd received any type of customer service at all. Unfortunately for this arrogant owner, he seems to believe that it's good business sense to alienate people for attempting to patronize his business. I will never, ever go back.",1
"Things go well for me at lunch at Uncle Sam's. I can always find a good seat, enjoy a pint of Fat Tire with a freshly made personal sized pizza, and the wait is never long. The waitstaff is rather young so sometimes the service isn't as good as other visits, but the quality freshness of food, good personal pizza at lunch, and nicely priced happy hour will keep me coming back.",2
"The meat ball pasta is gigantic! The hot Chili is amazing for drunken people like me! The location is perfect and the service is ok. The chocolate chip sundae, it was like heaven in my mouth. nI would say this place is perfect for anyone who goes to Vegas and doesn't know where to eat. The place is so pop out of the Strip, definitely won't have problem founding it.",2
"Found Nancy on craigslist, we settled on a price and there service was Fast, friendly professional they did my job in record breaking time, and the price was fantastic. It was such a good job, I HIGHLY recommend this company, and I will give there business card to anyone who wants good prices and great service, THANK YOU.",2
"I love having a place to take my clothes to get money back without having to ship it across the country. You have to be careful with what you bring in because sometimes there picky with the styles. The staff is very friendly and the store is always clean, I recommend this store to anyone that is looking for a cheap way to keep up with the styles.",2
"Harrah's Is good for a group of peeps who just wanna have a chilled night on the strip and not looking to do anything crazy. They have ""The Improv "" which Is a really good comedy club, The piano bar which has karaoke nights and live music nightly, The carnival court Is good for dancing and people watching and The Numb Bar has yummy frozen drinks.",1
"My favorite korean bbq place. I live right around the corner from this place and the food is spot on. after climbing all day at the rock gym, theres nothing like relaxing with a stone bowl of good food. the gaibi is soo good i just want to eat a plate of it. But seriously, try the Gaibi. its HEAVEN!",2
"Let's start with service, good all 3 time we've dined. Every thing we have tried has been above average, the Peruvian dishes where the best, plantains oh my, green chicken soup I could eat every week and more. Leave room for dessert if I could spell it I would, it was most enjoyable, let your eyes be your guide. Nice place, will dine here every time I'm in town.",2
LOVE this place. Greatest concept! Its fresh and you can put more or less of food you want and you can see them cooking your food instead of it being closed off not knowing whats going on back there! Everyone working there is kind and upbeat and are always on top of things. nI cannot tell you enough to come and try this place! Its fun.,2
"finally after 6 yrs here in town, got talked into going to blast an AK Glock. Unfortunately, they didn't have targets with Tupac or politicians' likeness on them. nA bit costly, and about an hour wait, but what popular touristy attraction isn't? The rush was so intense none of that mattered. nHearing guys repeatedly yelling out Scarface lines must get old for the people that work there tho.",2
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! I paid 65.00 for a gel full set.nothing fancy about it what so ever. What I got was nail polish that peeled off days later and a brand new set of nails that broke two weeks after they were put on. The place is clean and nice inside but that doesnt give them an excuse to give cheap service and up charge for it.,1
"The food and waiter service was good and at a good price. nThe bad thing was the busser. Half of us were still eating when he descended on our table and started removing dishes. When my husband asked him not to, he ignored him then he muttered that was his job and even took my husband's bread plate as he was still eating. nThe manager was no where to be found.",1
"This company is a major joke , I ordered a 215.00 pair of boots on October 9th and today is November 19th and still no product ! I have called multiple times and the people are extremely rude and not helpful at all. Their site says it ships next business day . REALLY ? And it was not a special order .",1
"Had lunch here and we loved it! Service was excellent! We where immediately greeted and shown to a table. Our waiter came right over and explained walked us over to the service area. Very, very nice young man his name was Dannon. Meats,veggies,condiments and sauces where great! Dessert and drinks great! Price was reasonable for great service, and a full belly!",2
"Don't waste your money on the food. The food is over fried in old nasty oil and lacks edibility. The margaritas might have given me an instant cavity. The beef is low quality and the fries were literally, the worst I have ever had in my life. That being said, if you want to stop in for a beer and catch the last minutes of a game, moes is a decent option. Just don't pick up that menu",1
"Stopped by here to get my tires rotated and balanced since it was due for one. This place was super busy when I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon, but they got my car in and out within 30 mins despite the amount of cars sitting there. The employees were courteous as always and explained the work that was completed when it came time to pick it up.",2
"Zipps is a local favorite and honestly has the best wings I have ever had. Between their 32 ounce beers, medium golden honey wings and happy hour specials this is the place to be for sports events. It does get packed quickly and the TV selection is a little iffy at the Camelback location but the food and atmosphere make up for it!",2
So happy that they added this location. Now I can eat there when I am close to home and when I am driving around the southwest side of town. Great food and great service! The owners have a wonderful family and we are happy to support them. Pizza for my daughter and I and Isabella sandwich with fresh mozzarella for my husband.,2
"Having been introduced to Chicken Katsu by a Hawaiian friend, I just can't get enough of this place. The staff is always friendly and the food is made to order.not waiting around under heat lamps. I've tried other places and their recipes for Katsu, but have always been disappointed in the preparation either cooked too much and dry, or too greasy and limp . L L has always been consistent.",2
Service tr u00e8s long. Certains plats dans les entr u00e9es go u00fbtent le congel u00e9. Les plats pricipaux sont ok et les portions sont raisonnables. Nous u00e9tions assis sous une bouche d'a u00e9ration et c' u00e9tait tr u00e8s desagreable. Bref ce n'est pas un coup de coeur pour l'amateur de nourriture indienne que je suis.,1
Was staying at the hotel and started craving beef. Again! We hadn't already been to Benihana so I decided to try out TJs since they gave me a coupon. I arrived and they had a prime rob special going on and it was DELISH! I drank a glass of wine and relaxed for a while. Nice romantic classy feel and good to get away from the mayhem that Vegas has to offer.,2
"We went here to celebrate a friend's engagement. We had dinner on a Friday night. The place was freezing, service was lackluster and the food was even more disappointing. 38 for a small and blah tasting salmon filet. A redeeming quality? Um everyone loved the mac n cheese side dish? Wouldn't recommend.",1
"I was not impressed at all.I got the slider sampler.had the opportunity to try the buffalo burger, natural fed, and angus need burgers. Burgers were prob decent, but the bread was sub par, if not just plain awful. A part of a great burger is the bread, and Burger missed the boat on that one! Fries.nothing to brag about.I would maybe try again, but there are so many options here, maybe not!",1
"I started coming here when it was still called Lion's Den and all I can say is that I absolutely enjoy going there almost every day. Sure, schedules and instructors have changed, but I am still pushed to my limits everyday and I truly recommend that everyone gives this place a chance and come to one of the best places to train in the Valley.",2
"I've been going to Kathy's for year. She has altered many pairs of pants, tailored shirts, and altered numerous dresses. She books people in quick 15 minutes appointments, so go in knowing a bit about what you want. She is quick and her pricing is manageable. She also great with working in the time frame that you need it in.",2
"I would rather eat dog food that has been left in the hot desert sun for a month. Their ""cheese "" amounts to moist paste with a dash of flavor. There is nothing special about this place aside from the quaint old cowboy feel. I would rather starve then spend my money here again. The best thing I consumed there was my beer. Do not believe the hype it cafeteria hot plate food with westerames. Awful.",1
"What's not to love? The decor is beautiful, the food is delectable and satisfying, and the service is friendly, prompt, and accommodating. They're willing to customize any dish to suit almost any conceivable palate, carnivore, carbo phobic, or otherwise. You get what you pay for, and what you get at Beijing Noodle is worth it.",2
Biggest mistake that I made on my recent visit to Vegas was not checking Yelp on this restaurant. As most reviewers have noted the food is not good and it is way overpriced. Lowlight of our meal. My daughter order the BBQ pork noodle soup. It was horrendous it smelt and tasted like a bad fish market. Find any other restaurant. Don't waste your time or your taste buds.,1
"I'm SO glad I finally had a chance to check this place out! I ordered their Protein Waffle it was fantastic! Not only was it HUGE, it was also very filling delicious. With generous portion sizes, great food, reasonable prices friendly wait staff, I can see why this place is always packed. I will most certainly be a repeat customer. ",2
"Once a trip I always find a way to come. The upstairs cafe has ""local "" take out dishes that are hard to find elsewhere. The crowd is 90 Hawaiian so it's a very friendly place. As far as the rooms, I couldn't tell you but I wouldn't expect too much. It's in downtown and a little run down but I always come for cheap tables, friendly people and the Hawaiian take out upstairs.",2
This is 2.5 starts really. I just didn't really feel any of the food was overflowing with flavor. It actually really let me down. There are at least 4 other pizza joints I rather go to. Very cool how fast you can get in and out but the bruschetta was just.ok. The buffalo pizza was just sad. And the cannoli was a waste of calories. Decent set up but just not impressed.,1
"Neat location. I like that they're trying some really different types of beer but I wish they would just pick a few and focus on those, I feel like they could be better. It's pretty decent beer but sometimes inconsistent across styles. I do think its improving though since I first visited. nEdited I have been here several more time and they have REALLY improved their beer. Recommend!",2
"Village caf u00e9 choose for me to have visit just for afternoon., Seem the environment become nicer at that time the portion they provide for each menu decent. Have not complain over their amazing chicken service delicious. The pasta and salad provided by them this order was nice in the last day. Superb the staff association.",2
"While their menu has tons of options it is all about their Sage Fried Chicken Benedict! If you really want to try something else, trick your friends into ordering other dishes, you order the benedict, and offer to ""share. "" Sure, everyone will sample each other's dishes, but YOU will be the one one enjoying the best dish in Vegas. Ha Ha!",2
We found this amazing bistro through a friend that's a local and we are so glad we did! Every time we come into town we make it a point to go there to enjoy a delicious dinner! The garlic bread is to die for and we have never had a bad meal or experience! We have had to wait a bit for a table but it's so worth the wait we didn't mind at all.,2
"I recently went into Sams club and had the worst customer service I have ever had at a Sams club. no one could take responsibility for there service. I have had a tax exempt business account for about 10 years, I gave the COS my card and I will never shop there again. they should get zero stars.And its quite unfortunate because I like them better than costco.",1
"I didn't like the BBQ sauce on the ribs here. While my ribs were passable, they certainly weren't excellent. I'm not a fan of baked beans at all, so I skipped that. I think they were barbequed which seems unappealing. The cole slaw wasn't my favorite either, it was kind of blah. All in all, I'd say go elsewhere if you are looking for delicious barbeque.",1
This Wendys just happen to be remodeled and my girlfriend and I decided to stop in and take a look at the new design of the store. the remodel has changed how you order and pick up now you order at one area and pick up another the dining room area has been completely remodeled with new tables new atmosphere and even a small ones area oh and boot there is wifi.,2
"The service here was fantastic and personable and you can tell they care about the food they serve. I ordered a steak sandwich and it was hot and good. The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars was because they don't take credit cards and I didn't see a bathroom anywhere. But if you want fantastic food at a simple, relaxing deli.can't go wrong here!",2
"Gone to this restaurant a few more times since my last review. The lavender milk tea has been my go to drink. The coconut passion tea is by far the most delicious tea I have had anywhere. And I am in love with their coffee jelly, which is only good in certain smoothies and tea, which I enjoyed with a vanilla smoothie as well as boba.",2
"Food is amazing! I would have given this place 5 stars if they had better service, five of us were there for brunch one of the orders was wrong, the price of one item was more than what the menu said and they didn't split the bill like we asked them to at the beginning. I would definitely go back because the food amazing. Food makes up for the poor service.",1
"Overpriced, tasteless food. With all the affordable but tasty food in Vegas.why settle? PF Changs next door is miles in comparison.delicious food with a great happy hour lunch special with dunks and food.don't settle! We ended up here, bc it was the first place we saw, and we were all starving after our flight from NY.never again",1
"Excellent homemade food prepared with love! The staff is welcoming and friendly. The portions are generous to say the least, and the prices are EXTREMELY reasonable! If you want a bite of heaven, order the cinnamon roll as an appetizer and share it at table, YUM. We will definitely be back. Another bonus for us no smoking allowed!",2
"For as many people walking around in a uniform, it's nearly impossible to find a server. I sat for 10 minutes ungreeted and this is an AIRPORT! Speed is important! Fellow patrons had to band together to get a server's attention. nSalad was good. nBTW, when did it become the norm to not have water offered?",1
"Ridiculously bad ""doctors. "" The internet helped me with my foot problem, but the ""doctor "" didn't seem to want to really help me at all with my real problem my foot , he really wanted me to say that I was depressed or anxious so that he could give me some meds! ""So.are you depressed? "" ""No. "" ""Are you sure? """,1
The main show was amazing. But dinner fell flat. Service was lack luster and unobservant. And why the LET tax at dinner 45.00 for 3 pax on top of the price of the tickets which we paid for separately? 600 for 3 people plus the price of the show not so much. My recommendation skip dinner and just do the show.,1
"Don't really know what they really mean by Nam but it's definitely not a Vietnamese restaurant. The name is quite misleading. The pho is below average but i guess ppl just simple dont have an option in Madison though. If you want to have decent pho vietnamese foods, you have to go all the way to the west side for saigooodles. Madison sucks",1
"First time here and I have to say I enjoyed everything it was soooo amazing! I had about five of their tapas all very good, simbal wings full of flavor not too spicy, salmon carpaccio light fresh and delicious, lamb lollipops soooo unexplainably good. I don't know what more I can say everything blew my mind nothing close to what I was expecting!",2
"I have been here last night for dinner. Everything was good except the hamburger. They served a ""medium "" burger with complete gray inside, which was definitely a well done. When someone orders for a pink, a full of gray is unacceptable. Although the meat looked good, I don't think I will go here and let a cook screw up a nice peace of meat while cooking.",1
"Went for the first time this weekend and let me tell you, I was not disappointed! There was a wait, but they are efficient and got us in really fast considering. I ordered the country fried steak with biscuits and gravy. Very happy! Biscuits are HUGE and the gravy was very flavorful. We will be back.",2
"I called the other day to make sure they would be open till 6pm. The girl on the phone told me yes. The website says 6 and chickie on the phone said 6. I had a coupon for a Christmas tree. nWell guess what? I got there at 5 30 and they were closed. You suck Star Nursery. I was going to give u my business because I wanted my Christmas tree. Home Depot got my money instead. Again, you suck.",1
"Sure the idea of bbq from a chain restaurant is a turn off but Famous Dave's really is a good place. The ribs are good the sauce is good, the brisket is good. 3 margaritas every day. Tonight our ribs were just a little tough and our server could have done a touch better, but we are fans and always like our dinner here.",2
"Overall a pretty cool place to stay. However, not the place to go if you're looking to relax for both the younger clientele and the roller coaster outside the hotel. Being a new property, the rooms are still relatively lightly tread and the casino is well laid out. The bars and clubs are fun. Not amazing, but certainly a fun place.",2
"Don't be fooled by the outside of this restaurant looking a bit small and pokey. Delicious steak, great selection of condiments and the milkshakes are divine! The burgers around the table looked delicious as well and garnished great reviews from the entire group! Not many tables tho, so would be best to book! Full review with photos please visit my blog which can be found on my profile.",2
I walked in to a grossly warm room temperature for my comfort zone. nThe woman who own the place kept giving me dirty looks I'm a very attractive girl and I do not be appreciate being treated differently just because of my looks n I'm a paying customer just like anyone else. nThe food is ok. I had shrimp chevihie. Was ok. nThe alcoholic drinks were great. nI did not get carded,1
"Unfortunately I'm extremely particular about meat that I eat.I can't deal with random fat chunks. Which this place seems nice and the one bite I did eat had good flavor, but does have the random chunks I can't deal with. If you don't mind that part then I'd say go ahead and eat here, you'll prob like it",1
"No WiFi. Not impressed with the salad that I had Citrus Turkey . All salads are pre prepared so they're not fresh at all. Lots of staff on break 3 and they take up 2 of the booths that customers would love to use. LOTS of trash on the floor a pet peeve of mine . I expected more, I suppose I set my hopes for a good bakery too high.",1
"Love this place! Mainly because it is modeled from Elsa's on the Park in Milwaukee, WI where I'm from . My fav bacon wrapped water chestnuts , and any salad or sammie and any cocktail A little hard to find Scottsdale unless you already know your way around but worth the search! PS Service could always improve here .",2
I'm now a Boba addict! When I came her for the first time I was kind of a deer in headlights with all the options. The place was also very busy. The girl that took our order was very patient and calmly answered all my questions. I played it safe and ordered the Thai Tea Boba Slush. It can fairly fast and was SUPER delicious! I cannot wait to be more adventurous and try some other flavors.,2
"This place is awesome! The food is very good and is great for bar hopping, hence the tapas. One of the best things here is the beer selection from Japan and the dining experience. The music is real chill and the staff are quaint. Probably even better is the price, although the portions are small and if you want to eat something to fill you, not going to happen here. Do try the hong kong flat rice",2
"I'm sooo freakin' happy right now. Rita's has finally made it to Vegas. I moved out here 3 years ago from NJ and missed having Rita's their gelati is my favorite , but now I can indulge all I want. Their fruit ices have pieces of fruit in them. The chocolate peanut butter ice is creamy and to die for. Their custard is delicious. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",2
"LOD 9 Was staying at HRH and decided to get a quick bite as everyone was resting up for the before a big night. Sat at the sushi bar mentioned to the chef I was not interest in a menu and to ""just bring it out "". Bottom line is that he killed it! Some of the best sushi and creations I have had. Of course the bill reflected it too haha!",2
"Their pizza is not awesome. I have never lived around the corner or even relatively close for the sole reason that their pizza is so not awesome. The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is because their bathroom makes a really nice spot to meet other men, if you know what I mean Their workers can be pretty tense and mean ",1
"So, I was over at the auto glass place getting a new windshield put into my truck when I thought I will just walk over here and try it out. WOW, was I impressed the Carnitas were OUT of this world! The service was good I only had a few knocks on them. 1. A .75 cent charge on any credit card order under 40.00 n2. No ice tea The place was very clean and the out door seating plentiful. Cheers!",2
"They do it right here. You'll think you're in Italy. The food amazing. The place is immaculate and the service impeccable at this family run establishment on the east end. I had the spaghetti bolognese, my boyfriend had the pasta sampler. A bottle of Pino Gregio, and a couple lemocellos after dinner. Perfect.",2
Fleming's has earned an upgrade in my book by bringing back the Happy Hour Vintage Vodka Martini. Two excellent Happy Hour food choices are the Sweet Chile Calamari and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp. Atmosphere is great and service is outstanding. If they would bring back the seared ahi at Happy Hour I would go 5 stars.,2
I guess they don't make very many veggie burgers here. The lady looked at me crazy when I asked for one. I should have taken that as a hint. Worst burger ever. It tasted like dry hard cardboard. It tasted like they got a freezer burned patty and over microwaved it. Don't do it guys go to the cpk next door. On the upside the French fries were pretty good but the burgers will make u sick.,1
"Probably the best Crawfish joint in Southwest USA! Imported FRESH from Louisiana. This place is the real deal. The last time I was there, we happen to run into former Louisianians and had said they were just as good as they had them back home. Be prepared to get messy. You order by the pound. They come in plastic bags and a tin bucket for disposing shells .",2
"They have a wide selection of everything and a new store to showcase it in. To bad they did not do a better job cleaning the rust stains off the floor from the last tenant before moving in. That said, once again they did not have what I wanted. I had to make do with something else. I did however, get an offer for help and didn't have to track someone down, as I've done in the past.",1
"Plain gross i went with my teen daughter and the food we order was extremely greasy, over salted, not even good to the taste. I am not even talking about the presentation in Styrofoam containers. We tried a few bites of each other's dish and ended tossing it all and went to eat elsewhere. Even the rice was not cooked right. TO AVOID",1
As I discover my own space in this life I begin to realize that I want it filled with people that care about themselves and the well being of everyone around them. nI can say that I have always had an amazing massage from John Hill and the positive energy he gives with each massage is the reason anyone should want to enter his Space Massage Studio.,2
"My mom and I went here this morning weekday . Paid 19 each used our players card for a bit of a discount . The only thing decent on the buffet is the toast. Food was cold, gravy was salty, donuts were hard, etc etc. If it wasn't for the omelet and crepe bar we would have left still hungry. Don't waste your time. Too many good places to eat in Vegas for around the same price.",1
This place was great! We thought we would try it since its in our neighborhood and were always looking for new restaurants.we had a pepperoni pizza and the fettucini Alfredo with chicken and both were delicious! Were happy also that they deliver and that you can stop in and grab a slice of pizza. So glad we tried it!,2
"From Aimee's help in finding a breeder to her personally helping us pick out a puppy, DBF ha been there every step of the way! We just completed puppy kindergarten with Shannon and I cannot say enough good things! Knowledgeable, friendly and a genuine love for dogs that you can see and feel. We adore our new standard poodle puppy! Thanks DBF!",2
"I needed a new suit recently, and had an outstanding experience here. The sales associate at the Men's Wearhouse was very professional and cordial. When i described what I what looking for, he showed me the perfect suit. The jacket sleeves and pants legs were a little long, but they tailored them to a perfect fit for me within a couple of days.",2
The roomiest Starbucks in the Las Vegas area. Its in a new free standing building across from the old Starbucks! Spacious and pleasant indoor and outdoor seating. Very nice! It must cater to the college nearby. I think I have been to about every Starbucks in the metro area and this one is the best. The staff was friendly and the order made right,2
"First time there this past weekend and now an official fan! Meat is delicious there, priced fair and such a wide variety! Only thing I can say negative is the size of the actual customer area.it was so crowded in there I couldn't breathe! But it didn't seem to bother anyone, it was full so they're doing something right!",2
"We have gone to this place twice and I have to say it would be one of the only two reasons I would go back to Food Truck Friday. The caramelized sugar is delicious. If they are there go their first. You won't be disappointed. I also agree it is the ""best cr u00e8me br u00fbl u00e9e that I've ever had. "" Get the sea salt, so good.",2
I like the HUB! It's the go to spot for having a drink and grabbing something to eat. Everyone who works there is attentive to customers and provides great service. Love the great beer selection. Prices are right. Food is always good and much better than any of the area competing restaurant bars. Try them out!,2
"The best cat veterinarian in Las Vegas has a new office. It may be a longer drive for some, but the new facility is gorgeous. It has a large, clean waiting area, and the cats of the Poppy Foundation have a home all their own, with lots of room to sleep, play, and live out their days. This new facility will allow Dr Steelman to provide even better care to the cats of the Las Vegas community.",2
"How did I not ever review The Bagel Cafe? Well, I guess I did live down the street from this place for two years before ever eating here. The Bagel Cafe is one of my girlfriend's favorite restaurant, so I've been here quite a few times this year. They have a huge menu with decent prices, and they have all the regular Jewish food you'd hope for, from matzo ball soup to blintzes. It's all delicious!",2
This guy name rafael which is a cashier. won't let us do a seperate order. he said we can only do 1 order per car. And I was like why? There is no car behind us. Do you want us to drive around and order again even tho is a same thing. And he said they been doing it since the jack in the box on lake mead first open. RUDE COSTUMER SERVICE. AND the guy who worked there name rafael is stupid.,1
"This is the place to explore IF you have a creative side, and have some fun social time! nThey provide the supplies and 'help' you paint a picture. Great for groups and you get to BYOB for food and drinks, including booze! And SURPRISINGLY some of the pictures are pretty good. Even mine is NOT embarrassing! HAHA!",2
"Been going there for years. Just went this morning and got a wakeup call that the coffee shop is not for the customers anymore. They dont offer variety as they used to. I used to be ablr to get a 16oz v60 pour over of any coffee today it was only a 12oz with no option and only there ""weekly choice "" coffee.",1
Unfortunately there are not many late night fast food places open 24hrs in Surprise. Avoid this Jack in the Box even though they are 24hrs. The night employees are rude and slow. Even had them lie and tell me their system is down. Even offered to pay cash but they told me they couldn't do anything. They need a computer to make a burger?,1
"Stopped in for a quick bite on our way to the movies. Food was decent, but extremely overpriced. Most likely due to the Tempe Marketplace location. The customer service was rough! After dealing with the people behind the counter, I was reminded that having a customer service based conversation with a teenager can be as pleasant as a kick in the teeth. I don't see a return visit in my future.",1
"We tried Ranias tonight for dinner. The food was really good love the brown rice also the jalepeno chutney Yummy. I had the steak kabob and my husband has the pan fried fish both were very good, We shared a vegetarian mushroom dish liked the salad bar and the naan bread. It's kind of a quiet place and didn't seem that busy. Which is a shame because the food and service are good.",2
"I've been going here on and off since I was in High School so, not THAT long ago Easily the best smoothies in town, even when compared to tropical smoothie and jamba juice. The food is great as well, and the service is prompt regardless of whether I'm there at 3pm or 3am. I would recommend a Berry Me with whey protein. And I am a fan of their teriyaki bowls as well.",2
"The service, decor and appetizers are always top notch. Crab claws and mussels are some of my favorites. While the steaks are always good, they leave me wishing I headed to City Hall instead. Factoring in the high prices, the steaks are just not my first choice. If you're into a simpler slab of lightly seasoned beef, however, this may be the place for you.",2
"Food was alright I'm not a big fan of buffets. I just heard they have sushi and this place is a buffet soooo I had to check it out. Place looked nice food looked yummy but the sushi didn't taste all great. The crab roll didn't taste like crab, or if that was crab it had a tast like cottage cheese. All in all food was good just not the sushi",1
I do have great reviews for people Verizon 5 Star Service all the time in their stores or even on the 800 number Ultimate Company I will continue my Service with Verizon I am very happy with my DROID of 2 years. I have No Complaints with them at all. I have been with Verizon for 12 years my business lines everything is Verizon. Thank you Verizon for such AmaXYNG Service. as always.,2
"We gave this place a try for breakfast and dinner, and were disappointed both times. The breakfast experience was terrible extremely slow service, ran out of coffee, food came out wrong, took 10 minutes to get hot sauce while over cooked eggs got cold. Food was way over priced, especially for dinner.",1
Consistently delicious food and reasonably priced. Friendly service. Nice atmosphere. nMy only dislike was the noise level in the restaurant on a busy Saturday morning but I was happy to see the place so full support local business! . Will certainly be visiting again and am anxious to try the lunch menu!,2
"Really enjoyed this restaurant. I've eaten there several times and our servers were very attentive and took very good care of us. The bread was fresh and yummy. The steaks were absolutely delicious. The sides were really good. Overall I enjoyed the experience and the food. Every time I've gone, I've had a really enjoyable experience. I highly recommend.",2
"The staff is super friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and well appointed. The breakfast is meh, but that's not the problem. I'm guessing their HVAC intake unit is next to restaurants' exhaust, because the place reeks of frying oil. Also walls are paper thin. Otherwise, the location is great. Wish they would look into this smell issue.",1
"I had 2 for 1 coupons so I came for dinner and breakfast. nThe prime rib was awesome! cooked to perfection, my husband had the burger and liked it, and for breakfast I loved the biscuits! very yummy! the eggs and bacon were fine, my husband got the new york steak and eggs, he asked for well done and got medium rare, but he still ate it. staff was nice! gotta love the coupons!",2
"I really like how clean and friendly it is at the Smashburger. I didn't care much for the burger itself but the fixings were good. Shoestring fries aren't my favorite either, it's like you have to eat a mouth full to taste some potato, gimmie some big ol steak fries! I had a really great conversation with one of my professors here so that made my meal stellar!",2
"Love the makeover! Restaurant is extremely clean, decor is well executed, and staff is not only fun and friendly but also professional which is hard to find . Teppan chefs are hilarious and I most certainly award the ""dinnertainment "" with five stars. I tired the fillet and scallop combo and it was top notch.",2
"The best thing about this place is the atmosphere. It's cute and cozy inside! The service was just okay. Our server might have been busy or distracted. He was friendly though when he was talking to us. The food was just decent. Nothing to write home about. I would return here, but only with my family who likes it so much. I wouldn't go on my own.",1
"Spot on for fabulous food, trendy drinks and excellent service. I will b back for sure. The menu is creative, the service from Dorian our waiter was super. The manager came to check on everything and everyone made sure it was a good dining experience. This chain is expanding for good reason. Southern food with fresh flavor. My Southern mom would approve.",2
"Check list Dirty floors, sticky cheap sliver ware, sticky menus, bad server, tasteless ""Mexican "" food. Just to name a few! nGuess you can make a living selling food to AllWhiteTukee that makes Taco Bell look like a five star restaurant! Pluses Atmosphere, chips, ice. Only good things in this place.",1
"Normally reservations are required but we went early enough in the evening that a table for 2 was available. Had the Zup Faglioni, Alla Nora and Crazy Alfredo. Best cannoli with pistacio nuts. Serving size is huge for the price paid. Server knew the menu and gave the recommendations. Garlic bread is the best. Rigatoni special and house salad was excellent",2
"Presentation was good, but the quality of the fish wasn't there and the prices were pretty high too, 8 for a spicy tuna and all specialty rolls were more than 12. The ""deal "" rolls are the same price per piece as the regular rolls, just less pieces. Even with the 15 discount because they just opened I was still disappointed. Overall I probably won't go back.",1
"We were invited to a pool party here. This is a locals hotel, very off strip, but tourists do stay here as well. The pool is very small, but intimate. The inside of the hotel is very dark and dismal, but has some very interesting art and mirrors on the ceiling. I would not return simply because it gave me a creepy feeling as though I would be robbed, or something . It is what it is.",1
"The food was brought out HOT, just what you'd expect after almost a half hour waiting to be seated and an additional half hour to get our food, which we ordered right when we sat down. and after all that wait, my food was overcooked chicken and waffles . If you choose this venue, definitely make a reservation however, the water was great and the staff was friendly.",1
We recently moved into a new home had a friend recommend this company. Steve came out and installed our new security system he explained how everything works and how easy it is to use the system. Steve was very professional and efficient. We already feel safer in our new home. Thank You Smart Security,2
"Seriously. What kind of restaurant doesnt have child seats? I didnt stay for the food because they didnt have them. Just looking at the place makes me think it would be a lovely place to have lunch with my other mommy friends. After reading most of the other reviews, I guess I should consider myself lucky that I didnt spend the money.",1
This is my 4rd year in UC and CU MTD is a life saver. You can go almost everywhere with them almost anytime. The GPS Systems Installed in each bus allows you to be able to track them in the web and know when they pass in your stop. VERY useful when you get wind chills of 20 F. My only complain is that sometimes the rides are too crowded.,2
"One of my worst service experiences ever. Now I wasn't expecting a lot but.I sat for 15 minutes, nothing. Others were getting service. So I went to counter. Took my order then served other tables.confusing. anyways I waited and waited for food. Nachos had no sour cream or cheese! They brought me sour cream but no cheese is chips not nachos.",1
"amazingggggggggggggggg! love, love, love, loveeee the show! the costumes were jaw dropping and the music was excellent! the place is pretty small and the costumes are pretty big so you don't have to sit in the front to get a good view! i got a student discount by showing my school ID and my ticket was only 25 bucks! best 25 bucks i've ever spent!",2
Service is SLOWWWWWWWWWWWW! I understand new restaurants usually are slow when they first open but this place has made ZERO improvement in terms of speed. Expect to wait a long time for your food. The food. it's a hit or miss. You have to find the items they make well. Pho is okay. The vietnamese dishes in general are decent. The Thai dishes are laughable though. Don't order the Thai food!,1
"I used to go here a lot as a fuming teen and I honestly can say that I was peer pressured into it by the god awful social hierarchies of adolesence. The food here is terrible. The pizza is disgustingly greasy and I would never, ever pay money to eat here again. The company should have been the one paying me to eat here.",1
DO NOT BOOK THIS MOTEL. Do not book thru expedia either. You will not get a refund. This place is the most disgusting motel I have ever even been to. The people around the place look like they live in it and I don't think it's safe. WOW the only thing that must keep this place running is people booking it and not staying and you get NO refund. BEWARE!,1
Went to a party for a friend about 50 guests. The food was very good. First course was an assortment of cheeses and meats with bread and rice balls. Main course was baked ziti or egplant parm. Salad and chicken picatta. Cake for dessert. Service was very good! Will be back next month when they have their liquor license. Cuz thats how I roll.,2
"The food and service were good. I'd recommend the french onion soup, chicken liver pate, and mushroom crepe. Also, the view seating outside is nice because you get a good look at the Bellagio water fountain show. Everything on the Las Vegas strip is priced relatively on the higher end, that being said, this place gives a good bang for buck.",2
I went to Sack's as an ASU student and I continue to go to Sacks as an ASU employee. The sandwiches are always made super fresh and the prices very affordable. My go to used to be the Symphony which is delicious but I have now switched to the Dali. Normally I am extra wary of egg salad prepared at different restaurants but this sandwich is delicious! That plus the free cookie? Yes please!,2
"I went there to get my dress hemmed last Wednesday and he said the next Thursday and when I went it to get it the day it was supposed to be done, he hadn't even started and he told me he was working on it right now which was a bold face lie. And when I went back to get it, he charged me for 30 for a simple dress hemming. It is such a rip off. I won't ever go back there.",1
What a view from the patio! That's what makes the 10 drinks tolerable. nA little weird dancing on carpet with heels on. but it works. The decor is so cool and eclectic. Tons to look at. nGreat music playing and videos above the bar. I was having 90s flashbacks. nDid you notice to private lockers for celebrities near the elevators. Very cool.,2
After finding out there was a shopping center less that a block from my hotel I was ecstatic! BUT after going there at 11.15am when they opened at 11am I was soooo disappointed to find that there is only one real store here. The rest are typical chain restaurants. LAME! The outer decor is nice though.,1
"Just got my haircut here, and I'm glad. Christina is the best, she knows what she's doing. Salon 3121 has yes, an ugly facade in an unattractive strip mall, but a nice interior with friendly people. I found myself welcomed with coffee, iced tea, etc. It wasn't crowded, which I like. Overall, I had a good experience here.",2
"Everything is great except for service. nSeeeeeems like you will get ignored more and more the longer you stay for AYCE. nI don't know if this is a tradition at AYCE sushi places, but this time it seemed quite obvious that they no longer wanted to take our orders. nEverything tastes very good, when you get it though.",2
"Too expensive and not worth it. I was waiting for a pie when a man came in to pick up his order of two pies and some side dish. 50? For some dough, sauce and cheese.really? When I went home and ate the pizza, I was disappointed. It wasn't anything special. Go to Barro's across the street. Much better.",1
I have been a fan of Changing hands for about 7 years now. The staff is helpful and open to conversation. The have a great variety of books and also carry a lot of used copies of McSweeneys which I really enjoy. I love the atmosphere and the good deals on used books. I do like the idea of supporting local businesses as well.,2
"I live in Cali so my loyalty is to Roscoe's, but I must admit that Lo Lo's is just as good. The service was absolutly wonderful, so that made my dining experience even better. LOVED the sweet tea it was perfect! The greens were phenomenal and that waffle.OMG! I can't wait to get back to Phoenix just to get another piece of the red velvet cake!",2
"This is for Pottery Barn Kids online. Horrible customer service. I ordered a monogrammed chair for my daughter for Christmas. First, they sent the chair with no monogram, then when they sent me out the correct order they failed to tell me it was on back order for a month! I had to call and try to find out where it was. Now her Christmas present is a month late. Thanks for nothing!",1
"I enjoyed this place. It's decent Sushi in AZ and it even appears to be owned and staffed by. wait for it. ACTUAL JAPANESE people. As opposed to 95 of sushi places owned run by Koreans who memorized ""Hello', ""Thanks "", and ""Cheers' in Japanese and attempt to trick their customers by pretending to be Japanese. Too bad this place is so far south it's practically Casa Grande adjacent.",2
"My brother was in town and we wanted to show him the ""nicer side "" of old town we did the seedy side on Friday night Obviously the Waterfront and Estate House were on the list. We didn't eat here but had a great time on the upstairs patio drinking. The five of us enjoyed our cocktails, the stellar service, and awesome views. Their ""Well Vodka "" is Kettle nice , drinks start at 9.",2
The Hash House in San Diego is WAY better. I had french toast and it was not impressed. The bread was dry and didn't have much flavor. I had to ask for syrup two times and wait about 5 minutes before I could get any. My husband had one of the scrambles and liked it. The bloody mary was good but the mimosa was below average.,1
"Need to hire experienced lifeguards! My son was caught under a tube for a few seconds. He swam out but was quite scared and out of breath. The lifeguard kept on sunbathing in the chair. He was not paying any attention! nAlso noticed that if you show up before 8 30am, there are a few empty lifeguard chairs.",1
"A bit disappointed with their steak, our group had an array of steak, rib eye bone in, rib eye, filet mignon, and a salmon dish. Granted it's Mastro's ocean club, their salmon was excellent, but their steak. Egh, dry not too flavorful. Service was excellent, we sat upstairs in our own room which was lovely. However the service did not make up for the food. Will not be returning.",1
"I just had a terrible experience at this location. First, 6 cars just waited over 20 minutes. Second, I was just charged a full dollar more for my coffee than at any other location I frequent. The response? Oh well I pushed a button and that's your price. They probably just know you at the other location. Seriously? I won't be back and I'll be encouraging everyone I know to follow suit.",1
"I have been coming to this place since it opened. It is downtown cool, with a simple, tasty menu, and reasonably priced cocktails. My favorite meal is to split a pizza and a BLT supremo with a friend. Also the asparagus with an egg is interesting and good. When you visit, be sure to stand in the elevator shaft, and use the bathroom, yes the bathrooms are cool! Cheers, David",2
"Compared to some of the ghetto Walmarts back home in LA, this one is a gem. I came here at 9PM and I was shocked it wasnt crowded. I can actually see thru the isles. Merchandise was were it belonged, on the shelves and not on the floor. The lines were short, no 40 min wait in line crap. I found what I needed and was in and out in less than 10 min. Wish my local Walmart was like this, lol.",2
"Best wings in Charlotte, hands down! Awesome bleu cheese to with them and great fries. My wife got the Friday Fish Fry and said it was fantastic, and the cole slaw was outstanding. Also serve Beef on Weck, which my dad approved of. Great place for Buffalo transplants! Was great to watch the Sabres beat the Flyers in OT there.",2
We just hired Gamez on Wheels to put on a birthday party for my son and it was a hit! Those kids had a blast. They will be talking about this party for a long time. Great customer service and very professional staff. My son and his friends also loved the game selection. Gamez on Wheelz does it right and I would recommend them to anyone.,2
"I love this place! I used to live right around the corner from them. The tofu paradise and choo curry with tofu are both amazing! Their spice levels are spot on. I love spicy food and cannot eat past an ""8 "" here because it is hot, but delicious. The only con is that the place is extremely small. Takeout seems to be the way to go.",2
"Why can't we give negative stars? This place would earn the most if we could trust me. They shorted us on our order and when we called to let them know, they got all rude and even tried charging us for food we had already paid for and hadn't received. Your money is better spent buying microwaveable pizza, that way you aren't disappointed, it's inexpensive, and no one will be rude to you!",1
"I love the Cosmopolitan Hotel, super classy, like a Vegas hotel should be. The bar is located in the middle of casino, plenty of seating, with large velvet comfy chairs. Service is quick, but our cocktail waitress was a bit grumpy. Maybe if she pulled the stick out of her butt, she would feel better. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend coming here.",2
This used to be my spot to hang out since it was close to my house. Once my fave bartender left this spot went to crap. Last time I stopped in I dropped a hundo in the machine and got my ass handed to me. When I closed out the bartender brought me my entire tab. He said he could only comp drinks while I was gaming. Thanks and see ya never again!,1
" ""YUMMMMMM i wish i tried the rodizio all u can eat meat buffet it looked so good,but eh, too much meat for me. ni had the rottiserie dinner instead which is the bomb. nloved the ceviche appetizer too,and crackers with somekind of olive oil they serve right before your meal. one thing tho,never order the their drinks,too strong and i dont think its mean to be ingested.

We came to the Rose and Crown for lunch and some drinks. They had a great selection of bar food to choose from. I ordered the Turkey Burger and my husband had the fish chips and chowder. Our server was SUPER friendly and attentive. It was a nice casual place to kick back have some Strongbow and watch the baseball game.,2
This place is incredible. I got the Eggs Benedict Sunday morning and it was one of the best meals I've had so far in Phoenix. They do it on french bread with a side of roasted potatoes and greens. They top the eggs benedict with roasted tomatoes for a really unique taste. I eat eggs benedict everywhere and this is definitely at the top of my list. If I lived closer I'd go to FEZ every weekend.,2
"I called ahead and they said there wasn't a wait. I've been sitting in the lobby for an hour at this point, listening to the doctor berate the assistants. Not only is he acting completely unprofessional, but it's making everyone or here very uncomfortable. Sounds like he either needs a vacation or a career change. I'll never come back to this location. Craigslist Rd or bust!",1
I am going to keep this review short and sweet. Silver Nugget has cheap bowling until 5PM. They have 24 well oiled lanes that are easy to bowl on. Never once did the fence get stuck. Nor did the ball return. No complaints there. Beers were cheap too. Certainly no complaints there. A good place to bowl. Nothing fancy but far from a dive. I'll be back.,2
We had gone here for the circus when it was in town! SOOOOO fun the seats were ok and the prices were un beatable! the grounds were clean! i had a very pleasent experience here as well as our friends who came around the sametime kinda pricey for coton candy 12! well it did come with a goofy looking hat. lol beer is 6 everthing else was a normal price as if you went to anyother event!,2
"Came here for HH with a friend who's local. And oh my gosh. the food! The HH is amazing, super awesome deals and great food to choose from. I would definitely suggest the bacon wrapped dates, it's insane how good it tastes! I would recommend it for the HH for sure, not sure about the regular hours Super nice place too ",2
"Warning You first visit will be confusing if you aren't prepared. Three different lines to order depending on what your ordering. Word of advice, just head towards the Adobada, the spicy pork sitting on the spit, so delicious! The carne asada was good but i've had better, next time i will try the chorizo.",2
"Took a cab from the strip to chinatown hoping to get some authentic Chinese food after many days of buffet. Very disappointed. I could cook much better fish porridge and steamed chicken than the chef. Besides distasteful food, the poor service is also disturbing. They even automatically add tips to the bill.",1
"If it's a work in progress, they've got to get to work. I haven't been here one night and I'm already dissatisfied. So far issues include No working ice machine on any floor n Broken iron and ironing board n Dirty carpets n Falling debris outside my windows n Non functioning elevators. The one thing that has promise is the bar pool area which has a good vibe that looked like a fun spot.",1
" ""As good as it gets "" for a chain family restaurant. I give it 5 stars because for what it is, it does it well. Food is good, service is very good. I eat here several times a month and have never had a bad experience. Servers are always attentive every time I've been there. It does get busy at times but I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a table.",2
"Seriously, this probably was the least friendly McDonald's ever. Other than asking for our order, which was 3 coffees, they didn't say anything to us when we went to the drive thru window or when we picked up the coffees. Not one word. We said thank you at each window. Will not go back to this McDonald's for anything.",1
"Right next door to downtown Urbana is Bunny's the most unrated bar in Urbana. They've got the cheap drinks and food, the outdoor patio and lack of scenesters. Thank God! With the smoking ban in place, this small time bar is probably struggling for business. Stop in and have a few drinks. drop a few quarters in the jukebox and tip your bartenders.",2
The only reason I give this place five stars is because of Marc Dillon. He brought me back after I had heard nothing but bad things about this bar. I was down and out and Marc treated me like an old friend that means a whole lot in my book. Vegas has a lot of bartenders but they can't find another one like him. D,2
"Just back from the Wicked Spoon.It's definitely the WORST buffet I've ever been for dinner. Incredibly long wait in Line Only to pay and then wait in a SECOND long line.about 1.5 hour wait. 35 per person.Server never came back to ask if we needed refills on our drinks.VERY LIMITED variety of food. Don't GO.Don't believe all the HYPE that it's so great!. If you go, you'll regret it.",1
"First time here in a few years and very disappointed. I saw it was all you can eat fish chips which sounded perfect, but in over an hour the waitress came back one with only 1 piece of fish. I would have loved to have more but didn't want to wait another hour. Great place if you aren't hungry or thirsty and don't mind killing a few hours just sitting around I guess.",1
"I like McAlister's. Just found out about this location in Baxter. The employees were friendly and helpful. The tomato bisque soup was very, very tasty! I also ordered a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. This was disappointing. The Elmer's glue I ate in Elementary school tasted better. It seemed as if this batch had been sitting around all day long. I would return.",2
"For starters, the customer service here is outstanding! You'll usually catch the manger in the front working and you can just tell that he takes so much pride in this establishment. As for the food? It is absolutely delicious! It will definitely keep you coming back for more. I only wish there were more locations!",2
"I'm a weirdo that likes plain cupcakes. No frosting. I asked the girls at the front for my special cupcake and they seemed some what taken back. ""I dont think anyone has every asked for that. Umm. Yeah. I think we can do that "" But Hooray! They came through and it was a glorious day. nSuper moist and fluffy. nYum Yum Yum!",2
"This restaurant is out of business. Too bad, we have ate there many times and they were a great restaurant, excellent service and good food. However, they changed their phone number about a year ago and did not update on their website or anywhere, which was obviously a problem. Went by today, Friday and they were definitely closed for good.",1
"Where gamblers go to die or loose their teeth. Went in on a Friday late night because we saw it from the street and needed to use the restroom, it was a ghost town! Maybe 15 people at the slots. No open tables. Bar was the of caliber you should only get bottled or canned drinks. On the plus they has some cheap bowling!",1
"Went for the first time this week. Had an 8pm reservation, hostess staff was rude and didn't seat us until 8 45. Wait staff was just as bad. Took 15 minutes for WATER. Food came out sporadically, most of which was cold. All the guys at our table enjoyed their burgers, but the rest of us found the food was nothing special. A waste of a Saturday night. RUDE STAFF AND POOR SERVICE.",1
"I am new to the city and desperately wanted some fried rice. After driving down Charleston for a bit, my husband and I saw this place and stopped by. It was pretty late and we were the only ones there. We both ordered fried rice and some spring rolls to go. Very yummy and reasonably priced. And the woman who took our order was very nice. We will return to try something else.",2
This is less a bar than a hotel lobby. It lacks a cool vibe or any real feel at all. I did enjoy listening to some nice music but beware the cocktail menu without the prices on the tables. I ordered a drink and it was 20! They didn't even garnish it as stated in the menu. They forgot my wife's garnish as well. The drink was ok. It should have been unbelievable for 20. Just skip it.,1
"The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because the price per pound of candy was too much in my opinion. However, just about any candy you can remember from childhood is here. All I wanted were a few pieces of black licorice and sour gummy worms and the ladies at the counter said I took so little to just take it all for free. Sweet deal! Pun intended. ",2
"This place was only okay. DO NOT go during ""happy hour "" when they are about to close, when things are half off. They are half off for a reason, they taste awful, and I would not be surprised if you get food poisoning from it. Even the soy sauce tasted bad. I went there before not during happy hour also, and it was just alright.",1
Had the chicken parmesan. First time I did NOT receive spaghetti with this dish every other restaurant that I order this I get spaghetti. Disappointed in that and the fact that the price was too high for what was delivered. Food was delicious and ambience was nice. Our group had consensus that was too pricey.,1
"They need some updating desperately. I didn't love holding on for deal life hoping to not get a concussion while riding this rickety rides. The Canyon Blaster ride was so short, and I was so grateful for the aforementioned reason. I also tried the Inverter which was pretty terrible. I'm getting sick just thinking about these rides.",1
Seriously this place is the best. I've been here 3 times in the past week and have gotten the Adobo twice. It's amazing if you like island flavors. Very Savory. Recommend upgrading your side to a special baby stack. So far every one I have tried has be delicious. Your moms gunna love this place at least that's what she told me when I saw her last night,2
"This bar is located very close from the entrance of the Wynn Theater, so it's perfect if you want to have a drink before the show ""Le R u00eave "". The only downside? Only few seats available at the bar, maybe 10, and you can't sit somewhere else, all the seats are at the bar. Bartender was very polite and friendly, and yes they have Guinness bottle .",2
"This place has gotten dilapidated since it's opening. My bathroom was moldy, a used condom was on my bed when I walked into the 2nd room they gave me. I couldn't sleep well in the place and the staff was a little rude. They lost my clothing at the bell desk, never found it and I left Vegas with a bad taste in my mouth.",1
"Was really looking forwards to garder manger, as I've seen Chuck on TV and his food looks amazing. Ended up being pretty underwhelmed. Pretty average food at a well above average price. We had the duck breast, expresso braised short ribs, lobster poutine and jerk crab. 160 for two without dessert and a single drink.",1
By far some of the best fish tacos I've ever had. I'm not much for standing in line and ordering but the tacos are worth it. I actually went back up and got seconds. Pretty decent beer selection for as few as they have. The restaurant has a really cool surf theme going on inside and they have outdoor seating as well.,2
"This place was just meh. The blonde ale was good, but other than that, I've had much better elsewhere. I also don't really think this can honestly be considered a brewpub. The good menu is quite limited, i.e. ""here are four sandwich options. If you want one, I'll take it pre made out of this cooler, and put it in this here panini press right behind the counter. """,1
"This place was just so cute. It was really old fashioned which I like, the quality is so good and they don't,t feel the need to do some fancy and inappropriate refurbishment which I respect a lot. I had a beautiful homemade potato and leek soup and then a coronation chicken salad. My mum liked her brie and apple panini too. Yummy.",2
"Rosati's has got to be one of my favorite pizza places here in Vegas. They have a couple locations all around Vegas. Although it is kind of pricey it's definitely worth it. They have a variety of styles of pizzas. My favorite is they're supreme Chicago style seep dish pizza. Facilities are clean, service was good, and employees were friendly. Overall a great place to eat good pizza.",2
"I want to give more stars and really like this place. Service was ok, carne asada tacos pretty good. Price is cheap. They have beer. Nice layout and good location. All great things but.The place is filthy. If you can't or won't maintain the dining room and bathrooms then just imagine the kitchen. We didn't catch them on a bad day either. What a shame.",1
"If I could give negative stars I would. Their pizza is not that great, go get yourself a five dollar pizza for better taste. They mess up your order, and when you go to call to get it fixed they tell you, ""I really don't care sweetheart. "" Don't waste your time unless you like shitty food and liked being insulted with it at the same time.",1
"Huge portions! nAll you can eat sushi dinner is 29 bucks, which includes every roll even specialty rolls which is cool according to the friend that got it. nI went with a tempura and beef rib dinner which was boring. nI've had better, but could possibly return just because this is so close to my house, maybe the lunch specials are ok?",1
The people here are very knowledgeable and helpful. The quality equals their reputation and if you don't go here you feel like a total loser because everyone does if they really love their significant other. they've really burned that in my brain with their commercials Their warranty is outstanding as well. I highly recommend them. Robert Pfeifer,2
"Two words PINEAPPLE AIOLI. Also, my burger, the pulled pork burger, was DELICIOUS. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive, atmosphere fun, casual yet still clean read no dive bar here! , and total bonus points for offering gluten free buns. nCame with 3 co workers, in town for work, but would come back again an surely recommend to people looking for a different twist on some junk food treats!",2
"We have stopped at Sauce a couple times now to either dine in or take out a pizza. The summer special pizza, salad, 2 drinks is a great deal. I'm a fan of the thin crust. It has a great texture, and I like that it is not crispy. I find that I like the red sauce pizzas better, and they seem to be a little less oily. The dining experience is casual but great, and the take out is very prompt.",2
"4.5 stars! One of our recent attempts at replacing Mint Thai. Service was good, totally friendly, small quaint atmosphere. Prices seemed normal, nothing outrageous. Food was tasty! And if ""thai hot "" isn't hot enough, they'll bring out thai chilies, some sort of crazy thai powder, and a paste. Definitely kicks it up a notch to the desired level. So many choices, we have to go back!",2
"J'ai essay u00e9 avec quelques amis et . Bon . Ben . Veni vidi vici, quoi ! Au moins, je l'aurais essay u00e9 ! nL'une des serveuses, la jeune, est particuli u00e8rement agr u00e9able, pas la plus u00e2g u00e9e . Mais la musique d'ambiance, de style r u00e9tro, u00e9tait agr u00e9able ainsi que le d u00e9cor. nIl y a d'autres sushi places u00e0 Montreal, quoi !",1
"I've eaten here on two of my visits to Phoenix and I've been impressed both times. The food is really tasty and it comes from a unique menu, which I love! The drinks are also really creative. My only criticism is that they're a little pricey but they're really not THAT expensive. A lunch for two, including an appetizer and drinks, was around 60. Overall, both times were enjoyable experiences.",2
"Really nice sports bar. Went there when I was in Scottsdale to watch my Texans play. The food overall was outstanding! The wings were delicious, the pizza was wonderful, and the brownie skillet was rich and flavoring! And the overall atmosphere of the place was so great, it makes me want to make a sports bar like that! Love it!",2
"So overwhelming. Waited like a caged animal with the rest of the crowd waiting for the gates to open. I came out the other side empty handed. I can see why people love this place but if you are picky about clothes, this may nto be the place for you. For a great bargain, I highly recommend My Sisters Closet!",1
"Great little place! Not sure why people keep ripping on the staff for service, we had great service and the food was amazing. We will definitely be frequenting rice paper from here on out. I would definitely recommend the pho mignon. The meat was extremely tender and perfectly prepared. Excellent flavor overall.",2
"They have great flavors, great buffet of toppings then just when you're ready to check out there are more toppings! The price is great and it's an awesome treat. I bring my friends from out of town often and they fell in love too. There's starting to be more competition in the area though. I've ventured to those due having way more flavors to choose from. I still can't hate on Razzy Fresh though!",2
"I have yet to have bad food here.Beef on Kimmewick, Mac and Cheese, Garlic Fries but I like Mac and Cheese better . They serve Becks and have trivia. Pretty easy parking and great staff. Nick is great. Decent beer collection. Want to catch trivia. This is the kind of place that if I lived closer to it.I would be like Norm form Cheers.they would all know my name.",2
Came here for dinner with a rather large group of 12 but the waiters kept forgetting things we ordered such as not bringing my friend's beer that we eventually had to cancel and not bringing half of our group's dinner. Overall the ambiance is fun an the food is good. I highly suggest you get the catfish sandwich,1
"Being from East Mesa I am spoiled by Waldo's, so I hoped this place might be comparable. I was pretty disappointed. I tried their original and sweet BBQ sauces and they both tasted the same and not very sweet at all . On top of that I found a thin piece of plastic wrap in my sandwich. I would return for the mac and cheese, free ice cream and friendly service, but not much else.",1
"This place is basically Roberto's but slightly better IMO. They always hook me up with large portions and tons of stuff on 1 plate for the price So far, I've had the carne asada nachos the star there and the beef machaca plate both were good. I have late night cravings for this when I get the munchies Stoner Joint",2
"The service was great and friendly, and can't complain.However, Over the phone the office told me that the price for all vaccinations for my puppy would be around 120 for all 3 shots. Upon checkout, to my surprise we see that the cost is 114 for each visit for a 356 grand total. That is not ethical business, and we will find a place that is more honest about their pricing.",1
"There isn't anything that I didn't like about my meal and my experience at Merci. The patio is dog friendly, they even had water out for Fido. The service was sweet and attentive, and the food was French and delicious. They had my favorite thing almond croissants! I am going back, and happy that I can bring my dog along!",2
"This is the most difficult gas station to maneuver in. If the arrows are followed this in only one way in and one way out. Sadly not everyone follows the arrows, making things even more difficult. I doubt this well get any better as they are landlocked. That is why I only buy gas here when I have to. Like all Fry's they accept your discount points, so be sure to use them, it can make a difference.",1
"I will never order Pizza from Dominos again. The replacement pizza was a little better. Till I got to the half that was not cooked. Nothing better then a pizza with good toppings, bottom of the dough cooked and the middle uncooked. How is this even possible. Who cares. I suggest you do not order from this place.",1
"I haven't been here in over a year, but this place was awful. The staff was horrible. Every time I would go I would get the hard sell to the point where I would actually leave. There was one creepy guy who kept repeating my name whenever I would go there in conversation. The store is decent, but no.",1
"This is a new fave place of mine. The servers were nice, the food was great! The tortilla chips come with three different salsas. Yum! I ordered the chicken and cheese enchiladas. Very good. Too much food for me to finish by myself but I tried. It can be pretty loud in there due to the music out by the pool but if you sit near the back it isn't so bad. I wish I had gotten a shirt. Next time.",2
A nice vacation destination. It's the New Year and I feel lucky for this place. It opens late especially around the 4 am hours. Ate the 13 pho and was completely satisfied. Nothing like hot noodle soup with some meat if course after walking around 30 degree weather in the desert. Worth the drive for people wanting better Asian food selection away from the strip.,2
Best and Classiest Vegas club so far! Extremely large and with great open space. We were able to kick off our heels and dance in the pool water only up to our ankles .the music dj was great.the people there were classier. Drinks are Vegas style priced so normal. nThere is a blackjack table in the middle of the pool so you can gamble too.that was a first for me. nCover was normal too 20.,2
"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. We don't have many places like this here in our city. I used to hate the taped up papers all over, it looked so dirty. I went back a few days ago and was thrilled to see they cleaned it up! So much better! The food is still awesome diner food. The staff is friendly and the service is fast.",2
"Do not go there! Ticket machines were out of paper so you couldn't use them and the ticket line was really long. The trash cans in the lobby were overflowing. There was no toilet paper, soap and paper towels in the woman's room. This place was a nightmare! I intend to contact AMC corporate let them know how awful this theatre is managed.",1
"This place is horrible. Don't waste your money. Worst quality seafood I've ever seen at any buffet. Lobster tails were dry and over cooked, didn't even try the oysters bc they looked and smelled awful, sushi wasn't consistent, some good some bad. It was just bad and let just say that I ended up paying for it later.",1
"I was in town for a conference, and decided to head out for a nicer dinner with some friends. Seviche did not disappoint! It has a cool, urban atmosphere with great food and cocktails, what more could you ask for? The waitress told us that up until recently, they were a tapas restaurant, but now they have also incorporated full entrees into their menu. I recommend any of their ceviche and tacos!",2
"Went back after I received a coupon from Andy thanks Andy and we were very satisfied with the various truffles and Bon bons. The vanilla creme Bon bon was especially good as was the 68 dark chocolate truffle. Compared to our first experience, this one left a great impression. We will definitely go back!",2
"Stopped in for a quick bfast while daughter was playing tennis nearby at SRP. Had corned beef hash and eggs. They were quick, courteous and reasonably priced.especially for Scottsdale. Probably wouldn't make it a destination given all of the cool restaurants in The Phoenix area but I would definitely go back if in the area!",2
"Have been to Brio twice recently and enjoyed both visits. Sat outside on the patio when the weather was perfect. Drinks were average price prosecco and food was reasonable half chicken with veggies . Service was fine nothing great, nothing bad. The location is quite nice and I enjoyed the 'upscale' feel of the Piedmont Row area. I would recommend it.",2
"This place is weird. They are an ""Italian Mexican "" restaurant. Maybe its me, but I don't need my tacos from the same guy that makes my spaghetti. n I had the gyro sandwich. The gyro meat was average and the tzatziki sauce was bland. I also thought 7 for the sandwich was too much too. nHaji baba's in Tempe is still the best gyro around.",1
I went to try this place but the parking is garbage. 3 spots one of which is a handicap spot. Who is the dumba that though this building would be a good spot for a restaurant. Maybe they want me to use the drive thru.NOT. nThis place is a hamburger stand with 3 parking spots.what a joke. Go somewhere else that can afford parking.,1
"This place isn't a that great. Sure, they have a beer special after 9 p.m. but no one goes here for drinks. They're burgers are terrible. The drinks are okay, but considering the price, they aren't that good. I hear the salads are good since I never tried them myself. The service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average. I would advice just going to Chili's across the street.",1
"pick a pasta. pick a sauce. pick a cheese. delicious. i even wanted to buy some of the fresh, refrigerated pasta to take home but the owner advised me against it since i had some other errands and the pasta would sit in my car to long. THANKS and good looking out most places would just want to sell you as much stuff as they could, regardless of how fresh it would stay.",2
"AVOID THIS HELLHOLE! nWe have brought our dog here for many years. Suddenly new management changes their pet policy. Long story short, I was THROWN OUT of the property, to sit on the curb, with my dog, at noon, in 98 degree heat. Waiting for a 100 cab ride to another Worst Western motel. This after arguing with management for 2 hours. nIf I had a do over, I would have called the police.",1
"Our family will not return! I took my 3 daughters in for a scoop of gelato. After, 1 lick, my daughter dropped her gelato on the floor in their store. I politely asked them for another scoop. The woman at the counter replied rudely, ""Not for free! "" I wasn't about to give them another penny for another scoop. I'm so disappointed in their customer service!",1
"This is the most insulting meal I've had this month. I ordered a chilli grilled cheese sandwich and was served 2 slices of cheap white bread with unmelted cheese and a tablespoon of lukewarm chilli in the middle. Uhm, really? And that for almost 10. I was left baffled, hungry and extremely disappointed. For a truck that specializes in grilled cheeses sandwiches, it's just not ok.",1
The food was really good and different than the other buffets. my only complaint was that the crawfish was plain. and for a place that is supposed to resemble new orleans they should have put creole seasoning on it. i didn't like how the server was rushing us to get out of the place since it was mother's day and a line. overall most of the food was very good and the price was great.,2
"possibly the best vegetarian friendly restaurant in phoenix. love the pita crisp. pretty good beer on tap, and lots of menu choices. we usually sit at the bar where they have several HD tv's and a full liquor selection. great atmosphere too. i've been to 2 other pita jungle locations and like this one the best.",2
"Whenever I have a friend in from out of town I take them here. Visually the restaurant is really attractive and feels comfortable. The people watching is fun and it's near fantastic shopping. Anything I've ever ordered here has been really great. The 'cafe' in the front is good too, if you're in a hurry.even for breakfast.",2
"Wow wow wow! I can't get enough of Zoe's. nThe food here is DIVINE. Completely SUPREME. I love it. My faves n steak roll ups n chicken roll ups n the slaw n rice pilaf n hummus n they have bomb iced tea. Plus, you can order and pay for your food online, so if you want to pick it up you literally walk in, are handed your food, and walk out. So easy. The people who work here are rad too.",2
This Yelp is for the Oishisa Sushi spot . Today I purchased Spicy Mango Roll with tuna I thought it might be a nice treat for lunch but it turned out to be a possible EARLY DEATH SENTENCE because the tuna was SPOILED so I had to spit it out . BLEEP YOU Oishisa BLEEP YOU! Bleeping Wally Mart Quality BLEEP YOU! and I called them to let them know,1
"'It's Tricky' is a brand new magic show just off the Strip. I've seen it a few times already lots of fun! Being young, the magician show presents fresh at times freakish material, minimizing tired old card tricks and maximizing obscure and original routines. It's family friendly, I've seen everyone from little kids to old folks in the audience.",2
"Not worth the price after having been to the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio Hotel Casino. This buffet was key word, ""was "" rated the 1 buffet in Vegas but since the rating, there have been a whole group of buffets that have outdone this place. This restaurant is mediocre at best. Also, service is very spotty. Once you go Carnival World Buffet, you don't go back!",1
"The Big Fat Greek Lamburger has an unfrotunately cutesy name, but an awesome flavor. Most of the fancy burgers run about 14 bucks and the classic burger is 11 bucks. Prices are not too unusual for a fancy strip burger joint. MY wife loved her burger too. We will be going back sometime in the future.",2
Good pizza for a decent price. The blueberry cheesecake was awesome. Our service was terrible. A 45 minute meal took 90 minutes because our server never checked on us. We had to repeatedly ask for the check. Then we actually asked another server to process the payment because we never saw our server again.,1
"I hate to do this and give it a bad rating, cause the place isn't bad, it just isn't for me. Like most chinese bakeries the food isn't sugary, which is sad.cause I like my sugar and butter. If you like your stuff more bread ""y "" than sweet, then you'll love it here. The place is good, if this is your kinda thing.just isn't mine it seems.",1
"This isn't your normal cafe'! These people understand the taste of the Caribbean and after a meal or two you will also. Everything seems to be on the spicy side, something I like but might not be for everyone. Great flavors, amazing smells and the cocktails might just be some of the best you will ever have. You owe it to yourself to give it a try.",2
"There with a group, 14 of us in total. Those that had tenderloin were very happy. Those that had seafood or seafood in their pasta, not so much. The appetizers were average, not the quality I would have expected.calamari was a greasy pile, the mozzarella and prosciutto was good, nothing special. I would go somewhere else next time, average to below average in my opinion.",1
"I've never had New Mexico fare, but I have to say it is delicious. I tried a pork Tamale red sauce , a chicken Tamale green sauce and a Navajo Taco all were wonderful. That great heat flavor, without being overpowered, was soooo good. This is a great family owned, personable place to enjoy a casual, family friendly meal. The next time I'm around this side of Vegas, I'm returning for another meal!",2
I used to love this place. They had the best tiramisu and chai tea latte till they decided to make tiramisu with vanilla wafers instead of lady fingers. I'm a big fan of vanilla wafers too but seriously it's tiramisu not vanilla pudding! Did they get a new barista? Their latte is mediocre now which sucks cause I really liked that place. Hopefully they go back to their original recipes.,1
"Really Misty every negative review your defense is ""not true, look for unfiltered reviews "". Seriously?! You are a liar, I forwarded the ""complimentary photo session "" email you sent me and everyone I forwarded to was utterly appalled at not just what you wrote but how you wrote it. Try TAKING ownership for YOUR actions I.e. your rude email. I I could post the entire email I would.",1
"The price is definitely very good for a buffet on the strip, but the reasons behind the low price are n mediocre food quality n very limited selection can be a good thing though n utter lack of care from any of the staff a lot the stations had nobody replenishing the foods therefore a lot of empty stations when there were on 10 20 customers in the entire buffet Very good beef stroganoff though.",1
"Called up one day and asked if they do builds on mechanical mods. Guy answering phone said no those things are a liability. News Flash its part of the vaping community primarily becoming one of the largest parts. If you want to grow your business I'd look into it. Definitely wont be stopping in and will tell other ""liabilties "" don't waste they're time",1
"The doggies were a little nervous but the two ladies who helped us made them feel comfortable. One lady came from the back and just picked Frankie up and another lady started clipping. Same with Uggy. I think the credit card transaction took longer than the nail clipping! My husband appreciated the way the place does business. 10 min, 5 a dog, nails clipped. Thanx for a great experience.",2
"Walked in the smell was great , however standing in line to get food than to sit at picnic tables or what have you, no not gonna do that, I won't stand in line to get my own food and pay as much as I would have to pay than to sit at a community table with a bunch of strangers , if I wanted to wait inline I can go to Arby's nTerrible.",1
"My lunchtime staple, I eat at this location once a week at least. Service is fast, and this place gets crowded. Between the nearby employees having lunch or the tourists visiting the outletmalls, it is always busy. Food is consistent and always good. I tried online ordering the other day, they had my food ready to go and I walked out in less than 5 minutes.",2
"Try the one in Huntersville, worth the drive. This location has terrible customer service. Been here twice and both times they said it would be an hour to have our bundtini's ready. They don't seem to like when customers choose which flavors are in the dozen. Huntersville has them ready in 15 min with the flavors we want every time.plus a map.",1
"Really good quality sushi! It's busy on Friday nights, but they take reservations. Great tamago. Their hamachi sashimi was incredible! Some of the best I've ever eaten. Very good customer service. The atmosphere is nice, not trendy. It gets pretty loud when they are busy, but it's definitely a great place to get excellent sushi!",2
"Hello Eye brow fans, like always I was the last one to know a good thing. My wife convinced me to go in I was hesitant because I really wanted my eyebrows to look like Andy Roony. But alas, I changed my mind nI now look like Brad Pit can you believe it? n All because I decided to do a little grooming. Good place, Thumbs up, Like, a lot. Marc",2
"Should've know when I didn't see prices on the menu. Apparently, the magarita booth is also owned by the gelato company. I ordered a margarita and it came out to 17.I was so shocked, I realized I should've just said 17 bucks? FORGET IT! and run off. THEN I realized.the margarita had no alcohol at all. I paid 17 for ice and strawberry syrup.",1
"Quick tip Way too far to walk from central strip. Make sure to take a cab. We came sober mistake! and went for the 8.99 steak beer. Mehhhhh. I could barely stomach the steak, which had absolutely no flavor, but the mashed potatoes and gravy were pretty good. I probably would not come back unless I was lit.",1
"My neighbour recommended this place to me and I'm happy he did, my wife's Lexus needed a major 100k service. They explained everything that needed to be done and even thing things that did not need to be done right then. They even looked at a door problem with no extra charge! I'll be back with any other automotive service I need. It's great to have a honest shop close by.",2
"Their 5.99 sign for their extra large pizza caught my eye so I decided to give it a try. Really good pizza! I've had their chicken fingers too, also good. For the price, their pizza is a steal. I ordered a similar size pizza from other places and it's double or triple the price. Oh their fries are yummy too, I get those with the fingers with ranch.MMMM MMMM!",2
"Da da doughboys fresh! Oh, doughboys. You always have me coming back for more. It's a great little pizza joint. Lots of choices that it's very easy to find a pizza everyone can share. Not to mention the all star line up of employees they have there. Everyone is so friendly! It's a great place for friends, family, whatever you got! I highly reccommend it. even if it is in Waunakee.",2
"Kerry is very professional. I was looking to have my eye lashes permed.not very many salons provide this service. I have been there twice just for the perm. She does an excellent job. My first visit she told me how long the perm would last, made sure I was comfortale and before I left asked if I was satisfied. I get the perm for special occasions and I am so please with how it turns out.",2
Service was great and food was good bar grub. Onion rings club sandwich were both tasty. Horrible beer choices nSMOKEY interior brought this place down. Typical macro beers and maybe one fake micro were only taps. Tried the patio but it was too hot and most drivers taking the corner seem to be trying out for Grand Prix racing team.,1
I had my car sent here mainly because of the name and it was anything but rapid. It took 2 weeks longer than the time he quoted me because someone forgot to order a part that was originally needed. Then when I finally get my car back I see that they completely cleaned out my car and threw all my stuff away.,1
"Great meal! Went for lunch and had the truffle potato chips, Caesar salad, lobster sliders, filet medallions and prime burger. Topped it off with the pecan pie spectacular and peppermint chocolate layer cake. Service was outstanding as well what a great group from start to finish. And thanks so much for the surprise pop overs in our to go bag!",2
"Was there for the burgers yesterday. Very nice burger, perfectly done. Loved the truffle mustard and red onion combo. Their mixed drinks need a bit of work. Ordered a Negroni that tasted like straight gin, and a Manhattan that was way too sweet. The cheese and meat board is pretty decent, although I would like to see some stinker cheeses on rotation.",2
"We had a drink at the bar before dinner and played a little video poker. When I ordered a second drink the bartender informed me, in an extremely non friendly manner, that I was not spending enough to get a free drink. Um, I wasn't looking for anything for FREE. That ruined my whole experience. nThere are literally hundreds of other places to go with better service.",1
Thank so much to Freddy's! You really know how to make a guy feel at home. I just moved here from St. Louis. There is this place called Carl's Drive in back home. No not Carl's Jr. That I was sorely sad about leaving. Well your burger put that sadness to sleep. Tastes just like theirs. Thank you again.,2
"This place is lengendary so naturally as a tourist I had to go. I can sum it up in one word YUM! Staff was friendly as we sat at the bar and watched the cook in action. I have never had a sandwich quite like that with a coleslaw like substance and fries on it, but I'd gladly eat it again. Lively fun place with people to match. Great for a quick casual bite.",2
Very unfulfilled to say the least and we were very hungry. We ordered from the lunch menu. The soup was not very good. Yellow curry was very average and pad thai was lower than average. Their won ton was pretty good. The waitress was nice. Overall I have to say there are much better Thai options available in the area. I wouldn't recommend,1
I love this place! From the moment you walk you feel the coziness of this neighborhood bakery. It smells like heaven. I didn't mind the calories because every bite was worth it. The people are very helpful and you can tell they love working there. It was a great way to start our day. I was a little bummed though because they have really good bread and they were out by the time I got there.,2
"We have invested heavily in Henderson and Las Vegas, NV and there is absolutely no way we can have pulled off our investments without Mark and Heidi at Rice Property Management. They helped us acquire the properties and they are currently providing white glove, hands off property management. Heidi is amazing!",2
"5 stars for. n The lightings n The tables n Food, meat, seafood nRibs and steak was well marinated. nSushi bar wasn't bad, nThe crab legs, gimme all of that! 1 star for. n Price n The long wait It was expensive, better eat your share of 50. nThe wait was worth it just for the experience, wouldn't really do that again. nThe food is so good, it'll make you go broke!",2
"I wouldn't even give this place one star. Went here for a pedicure and left extremely unhappy. The gal had me soaking in the chair for 25 minutes before even beginning, and also had the nerve to leave me mid job to go do an eyebrow wax. Needless to say, she didn't get a tip. I recommend not going and I won't be back. Shitty service and employees.",1
Ate here once about a month ago. I thought the food was great so I decided to return for lunch with friends. Arrived and the wait was 1 hour. That's fine no problem. Waited 1.5 hours then the hostess told me the chef said not to seat us. Don't you think they should have told us that before we waited over an hour. This place is very popular but it won't be for long if they do this to people.,1
"Wow, Luke my review for Fairmont reads eerily similar to yours. I swear it was independent. Anyway, I thought that St. Viateur had excellent bagels. For me it was a tossup between them and Fairmont, but I gave slight preference to the latter because I thought theirs were a little more moist and chewy. Both are incredibly good and put a smile on my face.",2
"This is one of the best places in Pittsburgh if you like East European food. I have been to Poland and this deli makes authentic delicious food. Anything you order is good, but I prefer the cheese pierogies and sauerkraut pierogies. The halushkj is also great. Take home some Wawel chocolate for dessert!",2
This is the best cafe in Vegas! Just walked over from Caesars at midnight to grub out on oversized portions. Started out with a Belvedere Dirty Martini which was huge and had the Seared Ahi Tuna salad for my entree! Fortunately I was able to split a mushroom cheeseburger which was awesome. There wasn't any room for dessert cause I got to look good at the pool parties!,2
"See my revue on TAO. This place is just as bad, times 10. If you want to have a good time avoid this club at all cost. It is SMALL. nThe VIP area is always extra full. You fork over hundreds and it is no better than the standard dance floor. I wanna slit my wrists just thinking about this place! DON'T DO IT. JUST SAY NO!",1
Been coming here for almost a year and I tip very well and they still can't remember anybody! Some are very nice but most are rude and arrogant ! The guy was on his phone wile doing my nails! nVery expensive! nWon't go back! nI rather drive 20 min instead of treated so rude! 72 for mani pedi! Out of your mind!,1
"Just go to another smaller place instead. We went on a night that was meant to be HUGE and it was full of people who weren't very good looking not to be snobby, but this was like the worst of the worst and somehow everyone else was stuck outside in line. Get on the guest list if you go and are a guest of any of the MGM properties.",1
"You can't judge anyone by the way you look.Food was excellent! But my server gave me blah service while he was kissing ass to the older ladies by me. Tipping is very important and I base tips by the service. I am very generous because I work for tips as well. With this service, he did not deserve anything. NO TIP FOR YOU! ",1
Whoohoo! The yelpers got it right! Delish to everything! This rice should come live with me. The gyros are my heros. Oh and try some before you buy some pita bread and pita chips. I'm hiding the cinnamon pita chips from my sister as we speak. Lemonade is made with real wild honey and these are not small cups. I'm full trying to make it through this review before I nap on the table.,2
"Great food service. Have driven by there for years and finally decided we needed to give it a try, glad we did. Guacamole as a starter. Had the Chile Verde ""Mauser "", superb! Pork cooked to perfection, verde sauce tantalized my taste buds, some of the tastiest I have had anywhere. Grandson's loved their meals and the fried ice cream.",2
"This place sucked. It was slow, they messed up our order and the people inside were rude. We went trying to get a FAST healthy lunch and ended up with a slow, gross smoothie. Over charged us by 2.00. It may be healthy but it's not worth the wait or the cost. 13 for two smoothies was ridiculous. Won't be coming back.",1
"Fantastic ambiance. Impeccable service. Stunning food. Like everything else in Las Vegas, too expensive. Rainbow roll was delicious, but it fell apart. Could be poor chopstick ability or poor roll preparation. Blue fin tuna sashimi special was every bit as special. Sampled friend's tempura, Wow! Simply blew away previous sushi experiences. If you have the money, highly recommend.",2
Very disappointing meal. The tacos and enchiladas I swear are smaller and smaller every time. The carnitas were sitting in a pool of grease. Gross! And the pricing seems to rise. Ordered pico gallo and there's a 2.50 surcharge. Where nowhere on the menu does it state it's a surcharge. When brought to managers attentions manager was combative and no service oriented. Will NEVER visit again.,1
Not good to have your party. nYou had to constantly tell the servers to bring the food in. No initiative! Rice came after the food! Owners doesn't care if the party needs anything. The server brought some disposable plates for the cake that we brought in. I then asked for ceramic plates then the server asked why not the disposable? Not coming back to hold for parties.,1
"After I read their website it advises that you call to see what they're looking for which I did. I brought about 20 pieces of clothing and they didn't take one. In my opinion I wouldn't waste my time, it appears to me to be a gimmick to get you in the store which I find dishonest .This company is unethical.",1
Worst airlines I have ever flown. Had to change my flight because of illness and had to pay a 200.00 fee. with trip insurance! And this is why I only fly SW Airlines!. Planes were dirty and hostesses were rude. Charged 25.00 each way for small bag. Asked a hostess for a coke after they had passed me with the barcart and you would have thought I had asked her to grill me a sandwich. Never again!,1
I brought 15 clients to this restaurant to enjoy a nice dinner and it was most disappointing. To list my complaints about horrible service and bad food would take to much time an effort. Las Vegas has way to many better places to eat than Morles. Spend your money and time and elsewhere. You have been warned!,1
"2 stars is generous, the food was sub par, service was terrible and rushed, portions were tiny and nothing special, i was starving after finishing my plate, all in all we were in and out of there in 20 minutes, not a good experience why not just stay home, and do brunch yourself instead of wasting your money on this place",1
"Terrible service. Ordered two dishes, never even received either of them! I was going to walk out because the food was taking so long over an hour and the manager THREATENED TO CALL THE COPS ON ME! Eventually the gave us some food that we didn't even actually order. They forgot about our other order too. All in all, a truly terrible experience. I would not recommend this place to anyone!",1
I am going to have to disagree with the review below. I was here over the weekend and I thought the food and the service was excellent. The waitress was very attentive to our needs. The manager owner was very hospitable and checked in to make sure that everything was ok. I ordered a mixed meat platter that was ridiculously good. I will definitely be back.,2
"Literally a clone of Miller Park in Milwaukee, from the layout, big screen in dead center field, retractable roof, and Fridays Front Row in left field. It truly is a mirror image with better weather.but little atmosphere, fewer beer options, no sausage races, and worst of all, since it is in the heart of downtown Phoenix, no place to tailgate!",1
"Our time at the Public House was fantastic! They have creative appetizers, delicious drinks, great prices reverse happy hour .and Karaoke! We had a great time recently and enjoyed the company of great bartender esses Stephanie and Jamie! True to Vegas, some ""interesting "" people showed up.made for great laughs! Go to public house for fabulous drinks, good, service and singing!",2
Went on a weekend morning more than a year ago. It says something that I still remember the details of my visit. They were just unorganized. Possibly overwhelmed. Lady who I think was the owner was just barking orders. Maybe we should have waited for a table outside for a more peaceful dining experience.,1
"We stayed at the Riviera because it was a groupon deal. Bad call. Ill admit the room was ok.after we upgraded, but the rest of the hotel is meh! You have to walk past crack dealers if you venture to the newer part of the strip. The restaurants are just ok. If your under 60, I would pay the extra money and stay someplace south of here.",1
"I have been here twice already in the past week and boy do I love it! My boyfriend and i have started to make it a habit of coming here after work, the sandwiches are amazing, the selection of meats are awesome, and the service is great. The owner comes in at 4am everyday to make fresh bread, he's such a nice guy. I will probably be there later today after work and ill post a pic.",2
"Mmmmm . . . this place is so good. I am just going to say right now, it's expensive BUT if you are going for a date night or to celebrate I think its worth it. The ambience is great and the food is too. I got the chicken and no lie, it was the best, juciest chicken I ever had. Guys treat your girl to this place and you won't regret it.",2
"Love the melting pot! Have been a few times and it's just as great every time. It's the perfect restaurant for a romantic night out. Yes, it is pricey but it's so unique and taste great that it's worth it! Two people is about 200, but the food is delicious and we get three courses drinks. The servers have all been amazing and it's always clean.",2
Only giving one star due to their ridiculous policy of not providing water cups. I asked for a cup of water and was given a cup. I looked at my receipt and I was charged for a drink! I asked about this and was told that water cups are only for children and the elderly. Non sense! He Malcolm the cashier could have told me before he charged me!,1
"Can't describe how bad this place is.was hoping for some good Mexican to replace Baja Fresh location and all we got were cheap ingredients in bland tasting Mexican slop. The guac is from frozen, cheese is cheapest shredded stuff you can get, oily food, hardly any spices. Taco Bell is better than this place and much cheaper.won't be returning.",1
"This was the worst experience ever! I am so disgusted by what I saw the waiter do that I couldn't even eat my food. The waiter stuck his hand and arm in the horchata machine to fix something, and didn't even dump the horchata out. This place is so dirty! There is no customer service at all. I do not recommend this place to anyone. My husband and I will never return. very dissatisfied",1
"Had one of my favorite breakfasts ever here while in Scottsdale last week! Very filling bowl of steak, eggs, and veggies. Since switching to the Paleo diet, eating out often leaves me unsatisfied but I could barely finish this breakfast and the taste was a 10 out 10! I strongly recommend for the healthy, on the go crowd.",2
Mon restaurant de d u00e9jeuners pr u00e9f u00e9r u00e9 u00e0 Montr u00e9al ! Un Point c'est tout.

Very good food excellent service planning on coming back. Great place for both men and woman a feminine side with chandeliers and sports shows for the guysThey also have live music at 8 pm and go on Groupon for fantastic deals 20.00 dollars 2 entr u00e9e s and an appetizer. Easy parking. Our waitress Tracy was friendly competent knowledgeable knew how to use the Groupon deal,2
"Antony is an awesome hairstylist! He has been cutting my hair for the past four years, and I am extremely happy with his work. He provides an excellent men's haircut . I am very picky with my hair and I appreciate his attention to detail. Clearly he understands the fundamentals of a good men's haircut . Furthermore, he has his finger on the pulse of the latest hair trends and styles.",2
"Food is AMAZING, service is SLOOOW! Kneader's in Gilbert, AZ off of Baseline Higley is AMAZING, NEVER A COMPLAINT! I really tried to give the Phoenix location to get in the groove after opening, but months later, they are still HORRIBLE! Too bad, they are right across the street from my work. I hope this goes out to the powers that be to step it up!",1
"What a Capital Grille! This was quite a disappointing steakhouse to say the least we had an awful seafood tower the crab was dry and tasteless, and the other seafood was far from fresh. The waiter dropped calamari on my lap and didn't seem to care. My bone in ribeye was decent, but it didn't make up for everything else. At this price point this Capital Grille needs to clean up their act.",1
"I live around the corner and was really pumped when I saw this Phat Burrito open up. It ended up being a very average burrito joint, more like below average. Very inconsistent, felt dirty, pass. Update This place is now closed, thank God. Check out the new place though, Sabor. They're cooking up some great Latin street food.",1
"The auto repair is open 7 days a week, and they have been completely honest and up front with me with any repairs I have had done at their location. nI have never once felt like I was being cheated or taken advantage of, and I will definitely return to Boulder Basic Sinclair whenever I may need a repair.",2
"I love these guys! VERY solid pizza and a great atmosphere. It only took two or three visits before Luigi was welcoming my entire family myself, my father, my niece, her boyfriend, etc by name. The garlic knots are strong, the sandwiches are good, and the New York style pizza is great. Terrific! Just like grabbing a slice in Manhattan.",2
Have had my stuff stolen from here TWICE. Both times I had a heavy lock on the locker door. First time they used bolt cutters and the second time was today when it seems they were able to pick the lock. First time their security camera wasn't even working to see who came out and this time I didn't even bother asking because the person only took my credit cards. Don't go here!,1
"It was decent and not crowded. The quality is good, the service a bit slow. We at at the Bar and chef was attentive. He even made the crab nigiri we asked for. I gave it two stars because there are others that, when I eat sushi, I can't stop saying ""mm "". This place didn't have that oomph for me, unfortunately.",1
"I don't know. This place seems a little tragic to me the self consciously arty vibe inside and the affected hipsters behind the counter are aggressively mannered, but also a little frayed around the edges. It's like a very good diorama of a coffee shop made by someone who has seen one in a movie or read about one in a book. The coffee is just ok.",1
"Grand China's lunch specials are my BFF. They make kung pao veggies for me, and it's like a taste of comfort not known since I was in the womb or so I imagine. it's always perfect, always quick, always hot and delicious. Oh. I love it so. The service is great, my water is never empty and the servers don't bug you but they're always around if you need anything.",2
"Do not go here! I bought a Groupon to get some tapes converted to disc and after almost seven weeks, I have nothing. These tapes are not replaceable, some are from childhood. I drove out from Phoenix during rush hour traffic and they were closed though it was during their business hours. I tried to call but the number is disconnected. Why wouldn't they return my tapes? Stay far away from them!",1
"Great thin crust pizza with a tasty sauce and the right amount of cheese. We had pepperoni on ours. It's the first pizza I have had in a while that you could hold by the crust and it did not flop. They also deliver, which is huge especially in McDowell Mountain Ranch. This is where we will be ordering our pizzas from now on. Thanks to Kreuger and Jeffrey. Great job.",2
"Sadly, visited on 4 2, and the paper was on the windows. We're without sushi here in Desert Ridge. This restaurant fell victim to really, really bad marketing and market research. The staff did a wonderful job and I wish them well. If anyone locates Nicki the sushi chef elsewhere in the area, please email me!",1
Aliante Hotel and Casino provides an excellent off strip hotel experience. The hotel is brand new and the prices are very reasonable. The staff is very nice and very helpful. The rooms are very comfortable and all of the appointments are very modern and slick. The hotel has numerous excellent restaurants and an on site movie theater. I definitely recommend Aliante Casino and Hotel.,2
"Second time visit with The Nail Room was fantastic! Michelle is some who has a personality and takes time to get to know her client ! My nails look fabulous and not only did she take her time to get to know exactly what I wanted , she suggested designs that would better suit my nails ! I will recommend everyone I know to go see her! I know I will be seeing her every 2 weeks ",2
I stop here periodically when I need something I forgot somewhere else or couldn't find. I find their prices to be high compared to other chains unless you happen to hit a sale for the item you want. The store always seems a bit cluttered and even messy. There is often stock in plastic boxes on the floor waiting to be shelved. It's just not a pleasant place.,1
"Went to dinner with three girlfriends. Horrible experience. Ice tea tasted horrible, and had to ask for replacement. Only given two plates to share appetizer for 3 people. Waitress ignored our table, though the place had only two other tables seated. Hair found in food. Quality of food mediocre. Won't be going back.",1
"Stopped by again, hoping things would have gotten better. Sat in a half empty bar for 10 minutes and left without even a glance our way. No ""hello "". No nothing. I just noticed that Yelp kept my review at 5 stars. Should be ZERO, but I con only go as low as one. nAnd please check out my updates below.",1
"Amazing selection of food and a decent selection of some more traditional Asian dishes for the adventurous American eater. Their sushi is bland and their quality can vary wildly, but their selection and quality of buffet food at good turnaround times makes up for it. Overall my experiences have been positive for the price.",2
"Overpriced, underwhelming. Tried the corn beef reuben which was disappointing and lacked flavor. We also had the steak with the oyster mushrooms which was an interesting sandwich, but the oyster mushrooms dominated the meat and just felt really unbalanced. As most people said. its pretty overpriced for what you get as well. I did see a 5 PB J. wonder what makes it 5.",1
"The moment you walk in it's very spacious. It has wood floors and accented with white decor. My roommate and I ordered truffle fries, seared diver's scallops, the spicy seafood pasta, and creme br u00fbl u00e9e! We shared everything and the food was delicious! I definitely recommend trying this place! Only bad thing, is that our server had really bland service.",2
"Tried for first time tonight, had small burger and skinny fries.burger was burnt and dry, oh so bad.fries were good up there with in and out.But forget the burger.Even adding more ketchup couldn't save this burger.Better off going across the street to Wendy's and getting a .99 cent burger.never will go back again.",1
"didnt really dine in, but we did a take out coz hubby was tired. the food wasnt to bad. compared to ramen sora, tatsu's miso soup has more flavor and when you ask for spicy, man is it spicy.flavor spicy, how i like it. not Hot spicy. i cannt remeber what else i ordered but other than that its a kute place to go.",2
"Walking into the store you could already feel the friendly atmosphere the place offers. The frozen yogurt tasted great especially since they have my favorites taro and pistachio! This place is much better then the Eastern location. I definitely will be recommending this place to my work, friends, and family!",2
"Have never been accosted at the door by an over eager banker ? before, trying to ""introduce me to me wells fargo services "". Personal bubble dude! Inconvenient location, very cramped and busy parking lot. I've been a wells customer for over 10 years, and I can tell you, I would have taken my money and run years ago if they were all like this one.",1
"The atmosphere is interesting cool. The prices Expensive ish but, what isn't in vegas? The food inventive, light and very enjoyable. Service spot.on. It seems to me that the dining quandary in las vegas is not about money spent as everything is expensive but, about getting something good interesting for the money. This place delivers. The miso black cod was definitely my favorite item. Try it.",2
"Not sure about this place. I have eaten here before and it was decent. However, tried to have lunch with the family on Sat, 3 10 12 and the place was closed at 11 30 am. Lot's of people trying to get in to eat and nobody from Dixies around. Not sure what the problem was but we were very disappointed. Went accross the street to the Queen City BBQ and had a very nice lunch.",1
"Tied for favorite coffeehouse in the Burgh. Great place for meetups. Love their hand squeezed lemonade. Great tea. Quirky and fun, with plenty of wifi to boot. A tad bit grungy, but that's kind of part of the experience. Street parking can be challenging, and stop at the ATM because this place is cash only.",2
Just awesome food. Chimichuri and meat. That is the focus. Gotta love it. Lots of authentic south american meats and desserts. They also make in the house cookies and fun little desserts that you can take with you. If you like to meet your t b sure to buy a jar and take it home. The sandwiches for lunch or also highly recommended,2
Nothing bad to say. If you love Chipotle you will just be happy eating here. It's a nice location and the food is always good. I started eating Chipotle when they opened in Colorado before they were a chain. This location is on par with the original. Go eat and enjoy a burrito the size of your head!,2
"Fix is very good but also very expensive, maybe because we had 3 Raspberry Sin martinis which equalled 60 just themselves. Personally the drinks were worth it, the Raspberry Sins are delicious. I had the lobster and steak which was very melt in your mouth delicious. The total bill for 2 people was a bit shocking at 232!",2
"Please do not go to this salon. This is very unprofessional salon. The owner is very rude, she doesn't have any personality. I was call to ask her schedule of her hairstylist and my phone was drop. She looked at her caller ID to get my number to call me back to threaten me because I hang up on her. It was unbelievable.",1
Cafe Berlin is located in a strip mall and is just south of Decatur. I arrived at lunch and ordered the bratwurst sausage which came with mashed potato and sauerkraut. The sausage was lean and the server who was the owner was friendly and helpful. I really wanted to try the in house pastries but was to full this time but will definitely return here again.,2
"Been a while since I've been here the hazard of ""Starting a Review "" on the iPhone app . I came here for the first time for my birthday last year at the suggestion of a friend and of my parents who say the fried mac n cheese is like the perfect drunk food . Not much I remember, but I do know I'll definitely come again. I'll repost a full review then.",2
"My wife and I went here about a week ago. I was very pleased with my chili dog and duck oil fries. The hot dog was everything you'd like a hot dog to be, a nice natural casing that snaps when you bit into it, moist and flavorful interior, and a nice griddled flavor. We found the restaurant to be clean and well kept and the staff to be friendly and helpful. We'll definitely come back.",2
"Travis came out to my house after I found him on this site. He was extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and showed up on time. His price was great and he was able to fix my problem without hidden costs or extra service charges like other companies try on. I'm saving this guy's number for sure won't be using anyone else. nThanks for everything Travis!",2
"Let me start by saying im usually pretty patient, but the service here just way too slow. Took about bout 20 min to get seated, when the whole place was empty, 20 min for the waiter to come. And god knows how long for the food to get here. Definitely do not recommend rhis place and will never come again, no wonder it has a 2 star rating.",1
"Poor service. Seafood and fish unappealing. We had the seafood satay starter, salad and fish and chips. Satay appeared to be out of a jar. The fish looked to have been from the frozen food section. Nothing noteworthy or delicious. Server team was pleasant but VERY SLOW. Also, could do without the Bill Cosby quote.",1
"I hated this place. Horrible service with really rude staff. They give you a rotten look when you cheap out on the tip. well guess what? Bad Service Bad tips. nThey messed up my order, it took 3 times before they got it right. I see making a drink is such a hard job. I don't understand what the rave is about, but its just a bar with no flare. I won't be returning here.",1
"I had my purse stollen while I was tending to my crying baby. When I brought the issue to customer service the woman acted like I was bothering her. I knew who had taken my purse and all I was asking was for them to check the cameras to see if she was still in the store. They said they couldn't do that and sent me on my way. Needless to say, I won't be shopping there anymore.",1
"The food and service here are fantastic. They have a decent menu through Tix4tonight dinner2night but their regular prices are not bad. I have been twice and have enjoyed the view 2 floors up right on the Strip , ambiance, food and service both times. We've had the steaks, seafood and desserts, and enjoyed them all.",2
My co worker took me to eat here let's just say I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken and inhaled it.damn it was good! Listen you're are not coming here to order the salad and watch your calories so get over it and throw down on some good food! Plus it's easy on the pockets and you will for sure need a nap afterwards. Look forward to coming back to try more stuff off the menu!,2
"Pricey? Yes. Get what you pay for? Yes. While I think over 5 for any drink that's non alcoholic is too much, I have to say the s'mores hot chocolate was worth paying for! It was awesome! We also got the humble pie. I'm pretty sure they used a whole jar of peanut butter in one slice! It was massive! It had to weigh 5 lbs! Make sure to bring people to share these great desserts with ",2
"I really enjoyed their service and food. They seated us immediately, the server was extremely nice and gave us wonderful selections since it was our first time there, the food came fairly quickly and was hot. They checked on us periodically to ensure we enjoyed the food. It was awesome from beginning to end! Definitely a new hot spot for me!",2
"The place has been around for ages and has a good reputation among locals. I have been twice, though, and was underwhelmed both times. I found my meals fairly bland. The service was reasonable. nThe best thing about the place is the location, on the water. If you sit indoors, the atmosphere is nice, with typical seafood theme.",1
"Decent food warm ass beer. When I suggested to the waitress to put some beer on ice she told me that was illegal? I couldn't finish the beer, ordered water and finished my meal before I strangled her manager. Wont ever go back there, its a shame nice tits and ass but that cant help you choke down a hot beer.",1
"Really? 5.95 for a one scoop sundae? Yes! Me Excuse me, this should have whipped cream and a cherry. Them Sorry, our whipped cream machine is broken. Would you like a cherry? Me thought 1. Tell me up front. 2. Send someone to the store to buy Rediwhip! 5.95? Really? Are we in Los Angeles at these prices?",1
"I've been here once and thought it was so so. I'm not sure how often I would be running back to eat here but I did leave with leftovers because this place gives you an ENORMOUS bowl of food! I also tried the thai boba tea, which I didn't love. If I'm in the area, I'd much rather check out four peaks which is a block away rather than this place, just sayin.",1
"I can't really give this place a rating because I couldn't try the food. I called to place a delivery and the phone just rang. 10 rings the first call, 8 rings the second call about 10 minutes later. I'd at least appreciate an answered phone with a ""please hold "" instead of indefinite ringing. I'm willing to try again, but will probably dine at the place instead.",1
"I went here for my birthday on Friday night and it was A mazing. I love the dark theme, the bodies on the dance floor. I adore that it wasn't over packed with a bunch of idiots wanting to fight. The girls are beautiful, the men are stout and we had just a whopping good time. Cover was 5 bucks, which most of you will spend more on a cheeseburger than that. Well worth it and will ABSOLUTELY go back!",2
"Poblano's errs on the side of caution. Nothing too spicy, nothing too daring. While the food is good and the plating's spectacular, the actual flavor seems to be more of an afterthought. This is a great place to take white Midwesterners who haven't been fully introduced to punch of great Mexican food.",2
"Bought a groupon for a remote starter, fine print said some imports require additional harness maserati, land rover, BMW, porsche . Apparently Honda was conveniently left of the exotic list, addtional 100. Starter never worked consistently, doesn't work at all now. Each visit requires I come back with an appointment, 5 appointments later, still doesn't work.",1
I absolutely love the interior design. I would take any friends here for a night out that is close to home but not the typical dive or gaming bar feel. This place feels snazzy. nThe us timer service is great. All of the hosts are interactive and make you feel comfortable but not overwhelmed. nThanks for a superb environment to relax and have a drink.,2
My second home! I love this mall it has all the stores I need I always take a full day to go shopping at this mall store after store this place does not disappoint! It does not look like much from the outside but you will be surprised how much there is in there.for easy parking just go underground and you won't have to fight with anyone for a spot,2
Mark must be the owner! He is an honest businessman who does what's right. nTook my car there yesterday and I needed well over 1500 in just brakes and shock needs but he suggested we do only what was absolutely necessary for the moment. nHe didn't pressure me and I decided to piece meal it over time. nMy brakes are 100 better!,2
"We got here at 7AM on a Saturday and they were practically out of donuts. We waited in a line of 3 people almost 20 minutes to order. Then when we got our coffee, they screwed that up, so they had to redo the coffee which took more time. The only reason I give them 2 stars is the staff are VERY nice. They just need to look at their processes and work on being more efficient and accurate.",1
"All AT T stores should be basically the same. It's the employees and management who differentiate one store from another. This store seems professional and the staff were organized and efficient. I've been to stores where the employees are more intent on having fun and joking with one another than serving the customer, but I'm pleased to say I didn't experience anything unpleasant here.",2
"The last time I actually seriously raised my voice in anger at another live human being was at some stupid twit at Cox. I despise this company, their brain dead staff, their total lack of customer service, and their completely inane policy of constantly stalker calling their CURRENT customers for telemarketing. Hate. Pure, unrequited HATE.",1
"I'm a HUGE fan of this chain, they have the best food. Always fresh, sourced local, and delicious. Unfortunately this location has repeatedly been a let down with crunchy rice, dry black beans, stale chips, and the guac seems to have been frozen. All watery and grainy. nWe're gonna have to drive a little further for a better location, which really sucks as this is the closest to our home. FAIL",1
"Good food, great service! We have used them for catering twice now and both times was a pleasant experience! They showed up on time, set up for us, food was great and a lot of people commented on how delicious and fresh everything was. I love supporting local business and this one makes it easy. I would give five stars but they definitely need more spices on the beef, kind of bland.",2
"Food tour was great! Jeremy our guide was very informative and entertaining. It was cold so dress warmly! I also expected bite sized tastings from each place, but at the end of the tour, I was rather satisfied. I recommend you doing this tour if you're not from the area and want to get to know it a little better while eating from local spots.",2
We stopped here for a simple beer before a baseball game. They have a good selection of beer on draft but they all tasted wrong and a bit warm. After 2 other beers coming out tasting like dirty socks I decided to get the safest choice. A bud light. Even this was disgusting. It tasted like they somehow added butter and Carmel to it. Avoid this place or if you must go get your beer in a bottle.,1
"You could classify my wife and I as total foodies. To be honest, I realty don't see the attraction to this place. They recently acquired a liquor license and the corkage fee is 15. The 30 cured meat sampler is average at best when compared to the cured meats offered in wine country on the west coast.",1
We decided to take my girlfriend out for a night since she is from out of town. Her ID is horizontal and not vertical and they did not serve her a drink. We asked to speak to the manager and he was completely rude with all of us and not accommodating whatsoever! He acted like he was better than us and talked down to us. Next time we want to go out we are def going to reconsider coming here.,1
"This place had a nice and clean atmosphere, but the food sucked. My wife had the Guinness beef stew and she hated it. I had the trio salad. The seafood salad was minced to almost liquid and the chicken salad was made with canned chicken. The lettuce was going old. The amount they are charging, the meals should be more quality. If I returned it would be for a beer, but nothing else.",1
"A beautiful dog friendly restaurant? Count me in! Dog bowls on the patio and beautiful decor inside, this is a great restaurant for a date or anytime. Joe was a great server who checked in often and was very friendly. Amazing sweet potato soup, fish and chips, and bread pudding to share for dessert. We'll defiantly be back.",2
"We ordered some bar stools from John at All American Fine Outdoor Furnishings in February of 2012. After waiting 8 weeks we received the wrong chairs. We were told that the manufacturer goofed but would ship the proper chairs via priority ""right away "". That was over 7 weeks ago. These guys are real friendly, but can't deliver. Pass.",1
Really cool spot for shows. Love the whole wall lined with screens for awesome light shows. Really cool dancers that are sometimes funky and not just the normal go go types. Depends on the night but can get some cool trapeze type performances too. Pretty good space size and good views for the performances. Like any Vegas club it does get packed but that's expected.,2
"Blue Marlin is great for date night. I've tried most of the entrees, and my only complaint was that the seared tuna with quinnoa was a little too oily. The soup and all of the other entrees I've tried still make Blue Marlin worth 4 stars. Other reviewers have said that it's loud inside, but the outdoor seating is quiet, peaceful and perfect for summer in Madison.",2
"I love this place, friendly staff, food is great, loved the mushroom enchilada, steak salad is always a solid choice and of course the classic jerk chicken salad, appetizers are awesome. ZTejas has my favorite salsa of any restaurant, wish they would bottle it. Drinks are awesome. Fun, upbeat vibe, great location.",2
"This place is my favorite place to eat in Vegas! I go to Vegas several times a year and make it a point to stop here every time. Its about 10 minutes from the strip and usually a line out the door, but worth the wait. Stop by early and you won't have a wait, but who wakes up early in Vegas. Try any of their pancakes or their Adobo Fried Rice Omelette. Enjoy!",2
"I came to this place with my friends, they were talking about how good it was. So once I got here I placed my order I received my food and while I was eating I see 2 HUGE roaches crawling around it was disgusting. I immediately threw my good away which wasn't even that good and walked away. I will never come back again.",1
"Received a ""detail "" for 60 that I could have done myself with a gas station vacuum and some windex. We planned on getting our oil changed as well, but they insisted I ""needed synthetic or it would void my warranty, "" which wasn't true. Trying to upsell by treating their customer like an idiot. No thanks.",1
"The breakfast food served when I ordered the scrambled eggs combo was probably scooped out of a buffet style bin dropped here several hours or even the day before earlier. The eggs were cool, toast wouldn't melt the butter, bacon was tough and room temperature. However, credit to my waitress for removing it and serving me by request a fresh fruit cup. Really lousy food at high prices.",1
"Ed and his team installed artificial turf for me a few years ago, about 2010. Of all the work we had done on the home, the turf installation was one of the few things that we were 100 satisfied with. Four years later it still looks perfect and it was the only fair price we had. I just looked them up on Yelp because I need a new yard renovated and decided to add my review.",2
"i've been here several times. once i was with a guy who has so much money they put us in the VIP section in back. wow, did they take care of us good. at one point i went into the bathroom i had about 5 HOT strippers begging me to take them back to our table. they have to be invited to the VIP area by a customer anyway. that was once crazy night!",2
"Pretty much the Pittsburgh interpretation of Tex Mex. This pretty much entails terrible salsa, blue margarita salt. Not nearly as loud as the Oakland one, and a better bar. They had mole burritos so that was good. If you want Tex Mex, go elsewhere. If you want to drink here with friends, well that's ok I guess. This and Steel Cactus are pretty much the same thing.",1
"Horrible service and deficient management. When I first moved to Avondale 5 years ago, this was one of our favorite places to visit. As the popularity of the area grew, the service degenerated. Go to another location or if your willing to spend more money, go up the street to NYPD, the service alone is worth the extra cost of quality service.",1
"Friendly place, wonderful service for a great price! I am from Europe and was looking for a hairstylist for four years! I am so happy I finally found it! BRANDON is the best! He is so friendly, professional and I can really tell that this job as a hairstylist is really his passion! Will come again soon! Thank you for such a great job with mine and my sister's hair!",2
"Luxus Hotel in sehr guter Lage. Sch u00f6nes, klares, einheitliches Design mit viel Holz. Ger u00e4umige, im gleichen Design gestaltete Zimmer. Sehr freundliches Personal. Hier gibt man sich M u00fche, das optimale zu bieten. nNat u00fcrlich ist das nicht billig, ca 120 Euro, das ist aber im Vergleich sehr preiswert, wenn man bedenkt, welche schlechten Hotels es in Karlsruhe f u00fcr 70 Euro gibt.",2
"I visited the nice looking store and met with a sales woman who seemed pleasant and helpful. She even came to my house the next day for a complimentary review of my space and the several pieces of furniture that I needed. To make a long story short, she barely made any effort and was so unresponsive, I wound up completely wasting several weeks. What poor service!",1
Some of the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. The grits were southern style so they were creamy. The shrimp were seasoned to perfection. I will always come here when I'm in the Charlotte area. The service was great and the place wasn't huge so I'm sure it gets crowded. Well worth the wait if need be.,2
"I LOVE WINGS! Best fried chicken wings I've had in the UK. Took my dad for his first taster last night, great service, relaxed atmosphere, cool music AND I got to try on the Chewbacca mask I would recommend the Tiger sauce, Chalapeno and Oh Canada sauces! I don't think I'll ever get bored of this place!",2
"A mini retreat within Vegas. They have great outdoor covered terrace that's quiet and with a great view of the Springs Preserve. You don't have to pay admission if you're just visiting the Cafe. I remember last year, they served an awesome Sunday Buffet brunch every weekend with live music. My Favorite Item Kobe Beef Burger. Yum!",2
I have tried several yoga studios in the Charlotte area and this studio is by far the best. The vibe in undeniable and the instructors are extremely helpful. There's a great balance between challenging vinyasa classes and restorative calming classes. I would recommend this studio to anyone who is looking for an awesome yoga experience.,2
"I visit the Nanyang every time I come up to Edinburgh as I own a flat in Jubilee Hall just across the road. I have never been disappointed with any of the dishes and the service is polite and friendly. I know that there are two other Malaysian restaurants a few minutes away but it is nice to sit and look out of the window at the stunning Victorian architecture, and I don't mind the price at all.",2
"A bit of a painful star rating, the place used to better until new management took over. Since the management the good quality has decreased, the staff are not very talkative, and service is slower. Food is average bar food, they have a pool table but over all your best bet is to by pass this bar and travel down the road a bit.",1
"If you are hungry and you want to get what you pay for.don't stop here. This is one of the only Chipotles where I get the stink eye if I ask for a little more rice beans meat not that I'm asking for mounds of food, but at least enough to fill my burrito The burritos here are way to small to be paying almost 8 bucks for a burrito I don't usually get extras like a drink or chips .",1
"Great food, and overall very good service. The menu had quite a lot of choices, and the lamb that I had was delicious, as well as the dessert. A but pricey, but it was worth it. The service was good, they brought the bill without me asking for it, which was a bit surprising, and didn't check on us afterwards until we asked for out waitress, but otherwise she was very helpful and prompt.",2
"I've always loved this place, but we were disappointed with our usual orders sloppy, non caring food and bartenders that were the same, never checked back no personality, no interaction.yes we know you are busy the last week of Spring Training, but we are locals that would have hung out all summer.get a barback during busy shifts and put someone in the kitchen who cares.",1
"This review is only for the Sunday seafood brunch buffet. It's the best buffet I've every had. I prefer it over the Wynn or Bellagio buffet. Usually, for buffet, you'd be lucky if you get a few items you like. But at this buffet, 90 of what I got, I would actually pay money to buy at a restaurant. It was great! Wait is long though, for obvious reasons.",2
Really excellent food. Took our whole company there to celebrate a recent success and they loved it. I highly recommend the fried rice. Very tasty and not greasy. I like it because the food is very authentic yet simple and made with love. Waiter is awesome. He even played a Cambodian xylophone for us!,2
"This was the worst health care experience I've ever had. Even though I gave a full medical history and went over it with the check iurse, it was completely ignored. This appointment was a complete waste of my time. Dr. Tan. Spent less than 10 minutes with me. And didn't listen to a word I said. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE",1
I bet the crab is delicious! I tried everything but the crab. The potato salad and hush puppies were good. And the beer battered shrimps too also good size. But pass the fried clam strips and fried oysters not the best and the lobster bisque gave me the BGs if you want lobster bisque get it at Aqua Knox in the Venetian!,1
As a new comer the the climbing world I was a bit intimidated to go with my friend but I had a blast and signed up the next week. The owner Joe and his staff have always been pleasant and courteous. They also do a great job of changing up the routes and keeping a variety that would suite any skill level.,2
"Came here because I was told this is one of the good dim sum places in Vegas. I'll be honest, I had better. The wait time to get dim sum such as the chicken feet, tripe, spare ribs, etc took about 30mins since we were seated. The tripe and spare ribs were bland. Only good thing was the fried rice and noodles.",1
I love this space! It totally differentiates itself from all other Vegas venues through it's intimate layout which offers a more enjoyable experience. You truly get to feel the bands and ambiance through great acoustics. I've had the pleasure of catching bands like Leche de Tigre to Street Drum Corps. I love the variety in their lineups and totally recommend catching a show here.,2
"Love Yupha's for both lunch and dinner. The service is friendly. Lunch is fabulous as you get the soup and salad that you can prepare how you want, with their really good warm peanut sauce along with whatever entree you order. Every dish I have ever ordered there is wonderful. I drive a little farther at lunch to go to Yupha's as it is my favorite Thai place in the East Valley.",2
I have taken my two dogs there twice now and have been really happy with this place. . The staff takes great care of them and I feel comfortable leaving my girls with them. They keep them busy and have naptime set aside for them from 12 2. My favorite part is picking them up and having them sleeping sound for the rest if the night. Definitely will be back again ,2
"tryout this place last night since many yelpers gave it a 5 stars. unfortunately, this place is no 5 stars to me. portion was small the mirugai on the sushi is about 1 "" by 2 3 "" on top of the rice ball the rice was on the dry side. ordered 12 pieces of sushi, 1 roll, an order of sashimi 4 thin pieces . 115 total for 2 adults a kid tax tips included . not going back. ",1
"Prime rib buffet every Saturday. The service was horrible and food was mediochre.except the salad on the buffet. Great salad. 16 person. Fyi kids menu is only good thru age 8. They have fruit as an option instead of fries. Nice live singer in the background. The prime rib guy can cook your slice more in a skillet if u choose, as well.",1
"Although I have yet to have my hair cut at this salon, I come here just about every 6 weeks to have hair painfully ripped off of my face. I have tried a lot of different salons around town, and Jessica is by far the loveliest and most friendly aesthetician I have ever had! She nearly makes the waxing experience pleasant Definitely a place I'll be staying loyal to!",2
"Went here for dinner based on reviews. We've been traveling for 10 days now and craving something spicy. Wow, wow, wow! Reservations are a must. We saw many people turned away. The Tom Yum Goong soup was very spicy yet so flavorful, we sweated through to drain the bowl the veggie side dish was spicy perfection, the staff were welcoming and funny. We're going back once more before we leave!",2
"Free wifi but not much range. Decent food selection. Go with Salsarita Breakfast Burritos! Wish there was a local alternative to Starbucks. It really isnt good coffee people. nIf you see an older pilot, don't try to be nice to them. They are disgruntled. You would be too if your company took over a million dollars of your pension away while upper management all took bonuses.",2
"Lo Cascio is a nice little Italian restaurant within walking distance of my home. If it was not so close I probably would have never noticed it. I go for the ""Early Bird "" dinners between 4 6 when you can get smaller portions for great prices. Everything I have had so far has been good and the staff is very friendly.",2
Jaw dropping. Hilarious. An all around amazing show. The stunt acts are integrated with a comedy skit that runs throughout the show and entails crude raunchy humor. Absinthe was definitely worth the long line and 100 ticket. Get in line early general admission if you want a close seat to be made fun of because they interact with the first 2 rows of the audience!,2
"This place has some decent barbecue. I ordered a half slab of ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, and potato salad. Everything was pretty average, with the exception of the potato salad that was horrendous. Additionally, many menu items were either sold out or no longer available. I'm not averse to returning here, but I doubt I will anytime soon.",1
"NEVER EVER COME HERE! 25 for a French pedicure, 30 EXTRA DOLLARS FOR GEL! I had to pay 55 for my 16 yr olds pedicure because the lady bamboozled us! I have never paid that much before AND it isn't even a great job! It took longer for the pedicure than me getting a full set! What a joke! Never again! What a rip off! I had to give a star otherwise they would not have given any ",1
"Friendly staff, clean facility, easy parking. I got a microdermabrasion with extractions for the Yelp deal price of 60 for 85. Good value for the service.although I can't say the microderm really helped. That is not a reflection on Angie's Aesthetics though.they performed as promised, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for skincare services.",2
"Stopped for dinner there while traveling on business. Greeted by a friendly hostess, seated and ignored. After 25 minutes without a server, I left. Will not recommend to anyone else passing through. I don't know if all the wait staff didn't feel like serving one person because tips are smaller for one than a group or if they were just incompetent or just rude. Extremely dissatisfied.",1
Came here a few years ago. Service was unbelievable. waiter to guest ratio was 4 1. Definitely pricey. had the 9 course sampler with the wine pairing with tax tip totaled 200pp. But totally worth it! You'd think the tiny bite sized portions for each course would never fill you up. I'm a BIG guy and I was getting full by the 7th dish.,2
This place is way to expensive for the product and service they deliver. I dropped of two simple women's blouses and the bill was over 13! The gal behind the counter when I dropped off and pick up seems miserable! She refuses to make eye contact and is impossible to chat with. nI will be looking for friendlier service with a much more reasonable price tag.,1
"They advertise ""Hot Ready "" I have been there several times they are NEVER hot ready. Tonight was the worst. They were more concerned with counting the till than helping their customers. Yes they were busy right before closing time but they had NOTHING ready NOTHING. That is neither Hot or Ready. This location is very poorly managed! Half a star!",1
"Pizza was mediocre. Beer list is Ok. They have TVs all around which is a plus. However, the facility itself is pretty barren. Tables and chairs are hard as rocks. It's really set up to be a college bar. but there's just simply nothing special about this place that makes it worth going to in my mind.",1
"Great food, beer and service! Stopped by after a long day. Great atmosphere! Plenty of tables. Will definitely be here again! Had the Pumpkin Pie Ale and Good Morning Glendale Coffee Stout. The pumpkin beer is one the best I ever had. Not much pumpkin but the spices cinnamon, nutmeg, etc . The coffee stout is based from Cartel Coffee here in town. Both are definitely worth a try!",2
"Friendly workers, but wish things were labeled better. The boba tea I got was not what I was expecting. I asked for lavender and got a blended cinnamon cream shake with flavorless gummies at the bottom. Donuts were great, just wish flavors were labeled. I will be back, and be more careful with what I order ",2
"I love this place, always good and always open. You have to try the Sustainable Tuna with potatoes or the Filet Mignon its amazing. Located in the Beautiful Bellagio Garden. I was there just 2 weeks ago and can't wait to go back. I have had breakfast and dinner here. The plates are enough for two. Desserts are perfect!",2
They are quick! Always quick to get your order to you and quick to refill drinks. Love that the food here doesn't make you feel heavy and actually tastes healthy without skimping on flavor. Only drawback is some tables are conjoined to other patrons which can be slightly awkward. Nevertheless great place for pho!,2
"Too, too crowded! Drinks are ridiculously overpriced and not strong nor particularly large. Hated the inside part of the club so we spent the majority of the evening outdoors. Nicki Minaj was supposed to be there the night we were there but she never showed. Thank goodness we didn't pay to get in! Hooray for being a girl in Vegas. No it's not fair but neither is life.",1
"If you're staying at the Cosmopolitan anyway, this is a great place for breakfast. Delicious French toast, tasty breakfast burritos, and an excellent bloody Mary with a strip of bacon and chipotle infused vodka the kind of bloody Mary that you eat! yum . It was the perfect way to get our vacation started.",2
"Clean gym, helpful staff and hardly ever crowded. Easy to get ur workout in without having to wait for equipment likes some other gyms. Steam room, sauna, pool usually clean however the jacuzzi is frequently out of service. Maintenance issues I guess but lots of members disappointed. My pops keeps bitchin about it. Lol Bummer.",2
"Oh wow. this is as good as everyone said. hard to find, but it's in that shopping center, get out of your cab and you'll find it, it's close to the main Spring Mountain Road Even if you get the omakase, ask for the toro with the chef in front of you, he is very friendly, funny and helpful with explaining to us the fishies. good place!",2
"There's a lot of fuss going on about James, people tend to overlook another stylist here. Ive experienced James' work so I can honestly compare the two. Perry is my kind of stylist. He knws how the snip a fringe! After repeated disappointments in finding someone who ""gets "" me, the shoe finally fits! Perry takes a lot of pride in his work and is overall a very pleasant person to converse with.",2
"Nice guy at front desk upgraded us to a suite in HRH Tower. Awesome suite albeit a titch shabby but considering the color palette it's expected. Beds seem to be feather topped, nice but a bit awkward. Very comfortable and relatively chic suite design seems more NY than Vegas. Fu dinner was much better than expected. Cake at the diner was dry. Overall a high recommendation.",2
"Yesterday I got my first tattoo with Ed. My girlfriend also got tattoos done with Rita and Ed recently and both were great. We aren't artists by any means, so they fancied up our designs and did an amazing job. Everyone there including Jess, the other artist, and the receptionist is very friendly and I'll definitely be going back.",2
"WHAT A RIPOFF! I bought a Groupon that was for exam, x rays, and cleaning. I didn't need an exam or x rays, I JUST WANTED MY TEETH CLEANED! But that didn't happen. I was told that after I pay 451 for deep cleaning which I don't need , that I could come back PAY for a cleaning. I am demanding my money back from Groupon. In fact, I want my gas money back too!",1
"If you are a vegetarian, or like interesting food, avoid this place at all costs. You may be tempted to meet someone for lunch business purposes. dont do it. find another place downtown. Its not worth the loss of 10. when I went.the service was slow, the atmosphere was stiffingly stuffy, and my salad was basically iceberg and some fruit.",1
Really good food and great service. I wouldn't complain about the price because it is Vegas and they do offer quality ingredients. I'd stop by for a lunch or early dinner. Not a place you would get too dressy for but a great place to get a burger. I went back later for their alcoholic shakes . Out of this world.,2
"Minus one star because our dessert came out before our entreee, AND they forgot our foie gras I forgot what we had, but my bf and i had the 5 or 6 course tasting menu. The only thing i can remember is the steak with foie gras and truffle. soo good it's a must get! As far as the souffle, Gary Danko was a lot better! Oh and the wait btw each dish was 15 20 minute, we got kinda antsy.",2
Il y a des sandwichs au porc effiloch u00e9 et il y a le d u00e9lice servi par ce restaurant. Je suis un amateur de pulled pork et je l'essaie u00e0 tous les endroits o u00f9 ce met est servi. Jamais je n'ai u00e9t u00e9 aussi heureux d'essayer ce met qu' u00e0 la cuisine de rue de Pas d'cochon dans mon salon.,2
I've been coming here for the last month. The new menu is great. The prices are low and reasonable. The service is amazing. Everyone is really helpful and polite. I love the burgers and sliders. Try the jalape u00f1o burger. It's delicious. The dining area is large and clean. nNever too crowded. The bar area is kind of small but nice as well. I recommend that you come here and enjoy yourself.,2
Best shaved snow I've ever had so far from LA to HK ! The various shaved snow options are so flavorful! Came with some friends and we all got different flavors to try not one of us were disappointed with our selections. Love that this place is so unique and experimental with their flavors! Will be a must go place every time I come back to Vegas!,2
Ate here for a late late dinner after an exhausting 60 hours of Vegas. The food was delicious! We ordered off of their carvery portion of their menu. Prime rib and brisket. Both a WOW. I will definitely be going back. nThe atmosphere was really laid back.then again we did eat there around 10pm. Can't comment on any of the beer though it looked like they had a large selection. Next time,2
Went here based on good reviews and was extremely satisfied. We were a group of several ladies and requested the chef choose a variety of plates for us to share and he kindly complied. The flavors were spot on and the service friendly. I would not recommend this restaurant for large groups as it is quite small.,2
Loved it. The hype was well deserved. My wife had Crispy Duck Panang and I had Green Curry. The duck was delicious and pretty much perfect. My curry was tasty and well prepared though their spice level was a bit much for me. It was my fault since I ordered it at a 7 without reading the reviews first. Wonderful meal.,2
"Came here drunk and hungry. We craved steak and eggs and our usual spot closed forgot what it was called . Anyway, it took us too long to find this place. Server waitress was kind of rude. Steak and eggs was just descent. Probably wont be coming back. I guess this is the service and food you get at a 24 hr place.",1
Amazing experience! Jose went above and beyond any expectations I had prior to waking in. He was able to answer all questions and give advice on stuff I didn't even know I needed to know. He was able to provide samples at little or no cost to make sure I got what I needed. Highly recommended and will definitely be back!,2
"This place is amazing. The soups, especially, are fantastic. The flavors are very complex and the ingredients always taste fresh. If you like things spicy, you can specify that with your order and you won't be disappointed. Reasonable prices, too. Their Atwood location has more space than the Williamson Street location, and slightly better ambiance. Expect a long wait on take out.",2
"Aroma has delicious coffee and comfortable seating. There are big, overstuffed chairs inside. In back, there is a pretty patio with tables in chairs. Aroma's patio is adjacent to Pekara Bistro's patio. So, you can get a latte from Aroma, a crepe from Pekara, and have an excellent Sunday afternoon lunch.",2
"An amazing meal! We came for dinner, it was a little expensive, but once we started eating I was amazed by the flavors and simplicity of the food! My favorite the oysters, they were amazing. The hardest part was leaving space the the dessert table! nThis will be a definitely stop for me next time that I am in vegas!",2
"My first Cirque du Soleil show and if their shows are like KA, then I need to watch more Cirque du Soleil shows because they bring some talented people to perform for them. The performers were on beat and the set up was great with the boat and the underwater scene. Their is no bad seat since its a good view to watch from the cheap seats where we sat at. Now its onto ""O """,2
This place is ridiculous! Had a table which was paid for in full then theres a random fight by our table which no body from our table was involved in and the idiots they hired as bouncers kicked us out our table form no reason! Will not be back and will let everyone know not to go spend their money here!,1
The best experience I have ever had in Charlotte . the bartender made my day with amazing cocktails and the movie seats are so excellent. I can't believe such a nice place served Hamburgers until I had one in the theater of course and then I realized it was prob the best burger I've had in years.top place to go at anytime of the day EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE DEF. GETS 5 STARS!,2
"They are not a good establishment when it comes to service, they forgot to get us tea and napkins after reminding them about 3 times. Also they charge you for regular tea now. They're meat is tough and the way they treat customers isn't that great, I had to shout ""yo, can you bring us some napkins? "" He walked away and just gave me a dirty look. What has this place become?",1
"I really enjoy this restaurant. My go to tasty delight here is the Fundido. I get it every time. The atmosphere is nice. I've been here quite a few times, and always look forward to going back. Service is typically good. The one incident I did have was when glasses were served to us with someone else's lipstick on them. That one kind of grossed me out!",2
"I am a big fan of locally owned and operated family type places. But this one is over rated, over priced, and the food leaves much to be desired! nFrom the too busy to acknowledge you at the door, to the self absorbed wait staff, overall disappointing! nAnd to think I went twice in hopes it was just a bad day! nNope! Just a bad place! nAlthough, it looks like a usual for the hangover crowd!",1
"I have to agree with the other complaints. I was excited for a Mexican restaurant to be close to my house. I judge Mexican food by the Chili Rellanos. Theirs was way too hot and I LIKE hot, but CR's are not supposed to be hot. They left the seeds in the Chili Rellanos. So I am back to driving to the ""hood "" for real Mexican food!",1
"I loved Moon! The music was great the crowd was drama free and the bathrooms had no line! We got in free and didn't have to wait! It helps to know the promoters! It has an AMAZING view! The atmosphere is great, and people here are beautiful. The bartenders were all gorgeous and the bouncers were nice! Moon is the Best I will definitely be back!",2
0 stars if I could. The atmosphere is terrible I feel like I am going to get lung cancer the second I walk in. The main problem I had was at the mess up on my order and then they charge me extra for messing up on my order I will never come back and I would strongly suggest avoid this place at all cost.,1
"The McDonald's equivalent of Greek Mediterranean food. Everything about this place oozed chain location. The lamb beef was very salty, dry, and seemed like it had been sitting out in a heat lamp all day. The tzatziki sauce was a bit flavorless, as was the pita bread. Avoid this place if you like flavor, quality, and authenticity.",1
"Best strawberry bubble drinks smoothies or teas I've ever had, hands down, no question. And I've had a lot! Other than that, the dishes are delish, the portions are huge, and the menu has a great variety. Yes, the food is a little greasy but thus very tasty , and the service is hit or miss. Still, for those of us who were are students in the Oakland area, Lulu's is a beloved staple.",2
"Let me paint the picture. Visiting from Los Angeles. Walked in on a recommendation for a drink. 4 of us good looking crowd. Walked in on a Tuesday looking for a table. Hostess said ""the computer estimates a 3 hour wait "" LOL . You're not that cool. I looked around this crappy light bar with a fat middle aged crowd. We walked right out laughing our butts off",1
"Orzo meatballs are good. Had the spaghetti with lemon and shrimp, delicious. My husband ordered the pasta fagoli. We both didn't care for it. He had the vegetable rigatoni, I liked it but he didn't. We didnt care for the olive oil bread. Overall it was good but not worth the high prices. We won't be returning.",1
"I normally don't like eating hamburgers, but I was curious about this place since the owner is the famous chef, Hubert Keller. I had the Black Angus Beef burger which was very tasty and tender. I also had sweet potato fries which was also very good. Burgers here are more pricey than your normal hamburgers but well worth it.",2
What huge disappointment thankfully we used a groupon and only paid half. Everything overcooked Best part was the all u can drink. I'd say full love no thank u. Hell half isn't even worth it. If u ask me go somewhere else def not worth the wait. Plus staff horrible some old guy fell and no staff member seemed even concerned,1
"The Brat was good. Bread was so so. I'm guessing the sauerkraut came from a can. Double cheese burger was pretty much an In Out burger. The patties were a little bigger, but flavor was the same. The Hawaiian burger was not good. My boyfriend who is a burger nut ate half and tossed the rest. The fries were good and plentiful.",1
Used to eat here all the time but the last couple times they have been horrible. food tasted old and chips are not fresh anymore. maybe they changed cooksi dont know but they are not the same Manny's with awesome food and reasonably price. nIve left a great review in the past and not my stomach churns every time we pas by this place ,1
"I am actually a Filiberto's fan, however this location just doesn't do it for me. Every time I have ordered from here. There food just doesn't have much flavor. I always drive by them on my way to work, like the idea that they are opened 24 hrs. But there are too many choices to choose from three by the time I hit the 101 fwy to settle on their food.",1
"really cool hookah spot! It's not trendy or pretentious and you don't have to call 3 days ahead to get a table. which is handy because we're usually downtown in cute shoes before we figure out exactly what to do and where we're going. anyway, there's happy hour cool people and the food smelled DELICIOUS i vote go, early late often",2
"I have longterm membership with 24 hours fitness, but this one is the worst one , they couldn't recognize my pin code and when i wanted to talk the manager he did not show up .My friend told me about the situation of this gym and the manager but i wanted to give a try. nthey just waste 2 hours of my time! nnever and never again !",1
"The food here is awesome! Always made fresh and tasty. This spot is one of my favorite places to eat! Its also open 24 hrs. My only problem with this place is the service. Sometimes i never get checked on or get a refil. Cant go wrong with anything i order, i know i will like it! They also have bobba drinks to which is a plus.",2
"How would I know there was a yummy authentic Chinese restaurant in Champaign? Thanks Yelp! Loved this place. The food was delicious and almost every table had the giant lazy susan in the middle for sharing. We had a large crowd and ordered veggie dishes, orange chicken, sesame chicken, and spicy shrimp. Everybody loved it and the prices were reasonable especially for a large group.",2
"Very cool bar! Rooftop, spectacular views, heat lamps on the patio. Drinks expensive, but tasty. 2 different dj's. One inside, one outside. Never waited in line. Laid back crowd, danced with fly brothas one night and cowboys and girls another. Bartenders give a little flirt. Typical club entry fee for Vegas, so get there early and enjoy the whole night!",2
"Ich esse im La Strada immer Pizza. Sie ist frisch, aus dem Steinofen und hat einen knusprigen Boden. Das Weizenbier ist sch u00f6n eingeschenkt. Der Service ist nicht herzlich, aber schnell und kompetent. Ich komme gern hierher, vor allem weil man hier zu sp u00e4ter Stunde etwas besseres bekommt als Fast Food und man gem u00fctlicher sitzt.",2
"It had been a while since I've been here since I moved but still such a great joint! The chicken wings are lights out, the tuna app was the best I ever had! The place is a great lay out. We played pool for hours. Such a great fun place to hang out. I didn't like the tea sandwich though. Kind of salty and the bread was too thick but that's just me. Everything else was fantastic!",2
K its a Thursday night at 7 00 pm and this place was a ghost town. Very sad by this told my 4 year old about this got in the car and pull up and YEP IT CLOSED. WHy promote this and downtown wants local business but if you cant have the places open how will that happen. nSee my review on the BBQ place at the container park Big Ern's BBQ. It just was a crapping evening in DOWNTOWN tonight,1
"You should go here if you want a smoky loud bar with a mediocre menu, full of drunken forty something's and skewing heavily toward sausage party. I've gone here at least a dozen times because a couple friends like it, but I would rather spend my money elsewhere. Also don't put money in the juke box. The bartenders will skip your music. Unless it's crap like Linkin park and nickelback.",1
I went to Picasso yesterday as a single lady just to get a drink some food. The service is terrible! This is my second time going. Every time I go the lady behind the bar looks like her dog just died. It took forever for them to come to me. I didn't get one smile from either bartender. The roll I had was good. But I can find good food elsewhere I prefer good service!,1
this is probably 1 of the best Chinese restaurants in the valley it's definitely authentic dim sum. They also a lot of fresh seafood in live tanks. I have been there 3 times for the dim sum and it has been excellent every time. I want to order an entree off the menu as it looks very good also. Only 1 complaint last time. the duck was cold and a bit too salty. I still have to give the food 5 stars.,2
"I walked in, saw macaroons, bought them, ate them, and LOVED them. They are so soft and flavorful. I really like their variety of little cakes and tarts, they're really cute and I can't wait to try them. Their mousse cups are also on point. The mousse is very fluffy and they come in cute little dark chocolate cups.",2
"Turkey burger was as dry as the desert I was eating it in. It sucked. And the fries it came with were room temp and chewy. Chewy!? I didn't really expect much from the looks of the place to begin with but honestly, my meal was pretty awful. My friends' quesedilla and chicken were actually good though overpriced, like everything else on the menu . Bottom line Skip it.",1
"My wife and I loved this show. In our opinion, it was better than ""O "", actually it is probably our favorite show of the 12 we have seen. It's a circle theater at the Wynn and appears that there isn't really a bad seat. Some believe that the higher seats are actually better as with most of the Cirque shows . I don't like giving away too much to avoid spoiling but in a nutshell, a must see!",2
"Best nVenue nEver I've seen quit a few shows and The Pearl is by far the best venue I've been to thus far. Not a bad seat in the house. Seriously, don't worry about splurging for tickets down front thinking you're going to have a better view. Add two large screens on either side of the stage. Great sound and friendly staff.",2
"Love this place. I went to Phoenicia when I was in Phx last month, and I'm glad I did. The staff was well informed, friendly and articulate. I bought two t shirts and a sweater and remain stoked about my purchases. It's nice to wear something unique as opposed to mass produced. I hope this place grows and expands to SF!",2
"The food is different and pretty interesting. The flavors are good. nThe customer service is horrible. For what its worth, u get what u pay for. nThe cafe needs to be upgraded in more ways than one can tell in a review. Bathroom is dirty and atmosphere feels dirty. Dont know that i will ever return to this place again.",1
"Beautiful studio, courteous staff. I love the fact that they do waxing nothing else. I've seen both Pam Tracy, both were beyond awesome! They take the time to make you feel welcome very comfortable! I had my first Brazilian here it didn't hurt! Already have my next appointment set up, I won't go anywhere else Try this wonderful studio I guarantee you won't go anywhere else!",2
"My friend always wanted to try this Two Hippies. It was horrible. We did not get what we ordered, not sure what it was but we know what it wasn't. We ordered the special tea and when the guy brought it to us he said "" we ran out "", it was more expensive that the regular tea and we were not offered any kind of refund. Waste of time and money.",1
"I am having a very bad experience with this place on 75th ave north of Greenway Rd. in Peoria. HOWEVER, I am going to give them a chance to redeem themselves or I am going to tell you what they did. Today is February 9th 2013, I will write another review in a week and let you know how they handled it. Call me for pictures explanation 602 725 7488 Larry P.S its not libel if its the truth ",1
3pm Saturday. Came here for the first time after going to Four Peaks Brewery for the first time. Four Peaks would get 5 stars compared to this. Really strange smell. Dumpy dive vibe as soon as you walk in. Good selection of beers on tap. Pretty clean bathrooms. warm glasses for beers. Ice for water came out of a Igloo cooler. Bartenders were nice but seemed amateur. Won't be back.,1
"Rooms are very blah. Water pressure stinks. Wireless internet is 15 per 24 hours. Really? For a three day stay, that's how much I pay for an entire month at home. Also, every staff member I ran into was discourteous. Any concern brought to their attention was an ordeal. The people who are suggesting you walk around and leave are correct. No reason to stay here. Skip it.",1
After eating here about a dozen times and this place being one of my favorite Mexican spots I will never come here again. Yesterday I stopped by and got the chicken fajitas. About an hour later I started getting very sick and long story short ended up in Banners ER with food poisoning. My roommate ate my last little bit of leftovers and started showing symptoms major diarrhea this morning.,1
This place. When to eat . And i ask to use the restroom. They ask me if i bought anything. Asshole. I know ur in the ghetto area. Does not mean all are ghetto that eat there. Chubby white hair latina u know who u are. Ohh before i ask to use the restroom. She rolled her eyes and said wait. Lol. That why u work there. No where else will hire u,1
"This place has great food including fresh oysters , an open and relaxing atmosphere and friendly staff. The steamed seafood bowls are prepared at the front bar using amazingly fresh seafood. They even have several craft beers on tap. Did I mention they have a great selection of fresh oysters? They're also open for lunch. Finally, great seafood in the East Valley!",2
"Fro to the mage. Crazy neon lights, mirrored ceilings, this place must have been a strip joint before becoming a restaurant! But the food! Huge portions, well made diner style food for decent prices 10 15 for breakfast. It's open 24 hours a day, and it was walking distance from our hotel at the Hilton Grand Vacations.",2
Ordered a half chicken cobb salad TO GO! Big mistake. Opened bag and had one fork. Salad required FORK and KNIFE so I could look civilized while eating. Lettuce was as old as Moses. At least 1 3 inedible. Tomatoes also old and obviously stored cut up for at least 2 3 days. Done! There are too many other places to eat in this area to make this an option. Go if you absolutely need FUUD!,1
So sorry to report I hade such high expectations and was so disappointed ! Packets of mayonnaise?. Restaurants in Scottsdale do better than that! Food quality did not even compare to anything in Hawaii who are your food vendors? Went back tonight and had the fish tacos because i had a gift card to use up wow they were amazing! I would so go back and have the fish tacos anytime!,1
"Worst store ever. I am a regular Fry's food shopper, but this store is horrible! I drive out of my way to not go here. Be prepared to stand in line for a good 20 minutes to check out with their 1 cashier. This is after you walk around the store and not one employee will greet you or help you if you ask. The parking lot is gross as well, trash everywhere.",1
"Much nicer than I thought it would be! My husband and I love aquariums, so we had to stop by the Shark Reef Aquarium. I was surprised by the variety of animals they had. The exhibits were very well kept and nice, with plenty of space for lots of people to comfortably stand. I would recommend stopping by at least once. Really nice, really fun!",2
"Joyce is amazing! I highly recommend her for quality personalized skin care. I visited her on vacation and had an incredible facial! My skin has never looked so good! Most importantly, she took the time and interest to treat my specific skin care needs. You can tell she is passionate about treating others! I only wish she was in Orange County so I could visit her more often!",2
"easily the slowest post office I've ever been to in my life. don't go here if you're in a rush after 2 30. there's always only 1 person at the cashier while the lobby assistant starts small talk with everyone to pass time. express cutoff is 3 20 which is when everyone's on break apparently. the people are nice tho, just the systems flawed.",1
" 1 TACOS! Who can beat that?! Not even Tacos Mexico across the street, not only are the tacos cheap but they are deliciosos! Also, they are the only ones, pretty much, that serve tacos de pollo my favorite . The salsas are uncovered, but who cares they're good! The staff is always friendly and funny to talk to. Make sure to bring your piggy banks, cash only.",2
"Ordered the Big Sexy. Lots of glowing reviews? I knew we were in trouble when I had to lower all the windows to stop my eyes from burning. A bottle of Pinot couldn't temper the garlic powder! A bottle of IPA faired no better. Since there were no other such complaints I will try it one more time, maybe. Sadly this pie ended in the compost bin!",1
"This place is awesome. A upbeat cool atmosphere with boho chic furnishings outside. The menu is small but with enough to lure the varietal tastes of my party of 4. I had the roasted salmon and the compliment of quinoa, apples and jicama made this dish simply awesome. Culinary Dropouts is my new favorite place.",2
BEST GYM IN LAS VEGAS! Bring your It's not cheap but u pay for what u get! You want the best u pay for the best! This gym has everything any novice to pro athlete would want! Weather you want to loose weight gain muscle and get bigger they have it and trainers to get you there! If u really want to change your life get started today! Tomorrow maybe to late!,2
"This place is a hidden gem. It's almost as if you were in another place entirely. The French inspired cuisine is simple and clean. Definitely a place for good brunch with your loved ones. I had the lobster roll it was delicious. There's a great outdoor seating area overlooking the lake, inside is very casual adjacent to a mini wine store.",2
"This is only a partial review as I haven't tried the coffee there. Yet. Stopped by for breakfast on way to the station but was already full of coffee so did not really want any more. nOrdered the breakfast sandwich, which is absolutely lovely, with spinach and cheese. Will certainly go back again, to try their coffee this time!",2
"Ivy has everything buns, pastries, egg tarts nom nom. and even zhong zi sticky rice things for Duanwu Festival . I've ordered cakes as well matcha green tea with red bean, mango mousse and both were delicious. Her egg tarts are the best, and Ivy is the sweetest. I'd say her pastries are very authentic more Taiwanese style . Delicious!",2
"eh. the 1st time we went there the lights never went off in the theater. We had to get up and go ask them to turn them off. Also the sound went off before the movie was over. We brought it to their attention and they were very nice, apologized, and gave us a few free passes. They are new and have to work out the kinks I guess.",1
"I always order 29 and it's really good but service sucks big time. I don't mind waiting if they're busy but it's the second time that a friend and I were kept waiting while another couple that walked in after we've been seating and ready to order, got not only their drinks first but also their food way ahead of us. Not cool. Not going back.",1
"I thought the stage and special effects were very impressive but besides that I wasn't impressed. It was a little boring, I was actually wanting it to end and my boyfriend actually fell asleep. If we didn't get a really great deal on the tickets I would be very unhappy. I think there are some many better shows out there.",1
Chipotle is one of my favourite mexican fast food joint. Its good that you can have the same tasty food rite on the vegas strip. for a veggie burrito its the same price as you get anywhere and just 25c more for the chicken fajita one .yummy. Dont expect the same sitting place and like the normal chipotle .but quality is same so enjoy the burrito in heart of vegas strip .,2
"Friend took me here for dinner on sunday night. nStarted with sake tasting. delicious, it was on the sweeter side. Our waiter was great and very upbeat. Had a few different rolls and different sashimi, the uni was delicious. The sea bass appetizer was pretty good also. First time here for dinner, next time def coming back for the other asian dishes.",2
"I had their golden wings I was not impressed at all, and their ranch tasted like mayo it was the worse experience ever I mean the food took longer then I expected my bill was 22.00 dollars I paid 40 and the waitress took it upon herself to give herself a tip like without me even giving her a dollar amount are you kidding me where is the manager ASAP .",1
"Simply great food and great people. You do not go to this restaurant for 5 star service and ambiance, but for great food and hospitality with prices you cannot beat. I have found everything is professionally cooked to perfection. I am used to fine dining but am willing to sacrifice all expectations for great food and welcoming hosts.",2
"I when here for gas and a cold drink. .and a bathroom visit.a Saturday afternoon. Big mistake. Worst, unkempt bathroom I've ever seen from any QT! And the line inside had to get three people deep before another guy decided to help out. Geez Louise, y'all can do better! The merchandise was well stocked and the rest of the store appeared to be clean.",1
I love this place. Friendly and the food is super tasty. Breakfast burritos! Salsas are awesome. Staff is warm and welcoming. Just found out that they were robbed yesterday. I am so sorry guys. That is just horrible. Sending much love and light to all of you and your families. Wishing you a speedy recovery. Please keep us posted. True Fan! nAnthony,2
I had dinner at the Savoy restaurant on 8 12 2011. The place is beautiful but the food leaves something to be desired if u are going to charge those prices get the kitchen up to par. My meal was shrimp and cheese grits.ugh! Maybe if the chef did less socializing in the dining room and put more focus on the food! To bad because the place is nice. I give it 6 months!,1
"I have truly missed Cafe Rio until this one opened up! So much better than chipotle! Love the steak salad. If it's your first time going to a Cafe Rio, do yourself a favor and just pick a meat, pick a salad or burrito and let them make it the way it was meant to be made. They know what they are doing, it's really great stuff!",2
"I was listening to the radio and I heard a commercial. It was for the Wendys baconator! I couldnt believe my ears, was this a comedy skit or was this a real ad? It was real unfortunatly. It has 6 pieces of bacon two beef patties and two pieces of cheese. http www.wendys.com . check out that bad boy. Thats soo sick Im inspired to go start a topic now",1
"See more reviews at city search. In short, this is a horrific company that is not honest, unresponsive and hell bent on misrepresentation. Hire a company that owns it's buses. This company has nothing but an ego and a desire to take your money. You will be disappointed with this company and all of their lousy employees.",1
"Wow. all i can say is disaster. overpriced food , small portions. come on , 3 french fries with the burger? . could go on about the food, buy why bother. nService. not much to say there , because there was barely any. sat at bar. yea it was steady but the bartenders where like deer in headlights. not sure what the problem is there or who is to blame.",1
I would rather not even give Epcor 1 star they are so outrageously overpriced. If I had any other choice I would never buy water service from them. Our water service is over double the cost of anyone I know and it doesn't include anything but water. No garbage we have to pay separately for that too. Bad business to rob your customers!,1
"One of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh! It has such a cool atmosphere, and the food is absolutely delicious. The lemon blueberry ricotta pancakes were fantastic. I also recommend the white chocolate ginger milkshake, which I got the last time I was here. I'll always make the trip out to Regent Square when I'm in town to get in some good, healthy, vegetarian food.",2
"This place is great! I love getting the first morning appointment. I'm in, they clean my teeth, and I'm out. Super easy and very friendly. They always call to confirm the day before and send the reminder card in the mail a few weeks before. Plus, if you go for cleaning every six months, you get two free tubes of whitening gel!",2
"I have to say how pleasantly suprised I am everytime I walk walk in and see the craft beer selection at this place. Its wonderful. My husband says Jim the owner personaly selects each of the beers on tap. I have to say that he has great taste! The local breweries are great places to go, but this place has beer from all of them! HEAVEN.",2
"Won't waste my time coming back here. With nobody around on a Sunday night, the 9 30pm showing of a movie nearly empty, we were refused tickets because I didn't have my ID to prove I was over 21. Really? I'm frickin' old enough to be your mother, kid. Was told we could see another movie on the forks side. For 30? No, thanks. AMC MAJOR FAIL! I'll just spend my money elsewhere.",1
"Great for the games and a draft beer. But other than their wings and onion rings, nothing else is worth spending your on. Besides, their prices are a bit on the high end for dry and tasteless food. As I said before, I go for the games and draft beer. Rarely do I order anything aside from wings. If you go, don't expect good food.",1
"Fantabulous! I come from South Florida. I'm a native of Florida. So we move to the desert, and I read the yelp reviews and it's only one mile from our house. Wow! The freshest and most original menu I've ever had. I've been to Tokyo twice, and I have to say this is as good if not better. I've just become a regular. Staff excellent. Don't miss great sushi in the desert. Whoooooooo Aaahhhhhhh!",2
"My first few times at the maret it was an amzing experience. It was like an event in itself. So much to look at and take in. They have a great variety and prices. However, during the summer months, it gets so busy its almost too much of a hassel to go. I'm so glad it's fall again so I can enjoy my time there again.",2
Took my daughter and 4 1 2 year old Grandson to Red Robin last night. Arrived around 4 45 and were seated. Not many customers at the time. Sat waiting 15 minutes for a server to bring us menus. There were 5 or 6 servers standing around chatting with each other. Finally got up and left. Always wondered what it would be like to be invisible. Guess I know now. Won't be back!,1
"Fun, exciting, adrenaline pumping is how I would describe The HUNT! I can't imagine a better way to experience Vegas and all of the incredible attractions it has to offer. The HUNT staff had so much energy! They made sure we didn't miss a beat. I Highly Recommend The HUNT for group events in Vegas, there were 12 of us and we had an absolute blast!",2
"Roberto's is a Mexican fast food place that is sort of between a fast food place and a restaurant. They don't make bad food with my personal favorites being the carne asada fries, the carne asada chimichanga combination plate, the shrimp a'la diabla and their rolled taco. This place is down the street from my house so I do eat here a lot.",2
We've gotten take out from here several times and really enjoy it. The gyros are really good and so are the fries. I got a cheese pita for my kid and I think I'll order it for myself some time because whatever cheese they use is delicious. Normally I'm not a fan of chicken gyros but theirs is delicious. They seasoned the chicken really well. We will definitely keep coming back!,2
"Harder than hell to get into no U turn on University, no lefts from either direction on Maryland , but worth the trouble. I was on the prowl for dolmas and found some terrific, homemade yumminess here. Will be back to try more! TIP They offer student discounts. This is much more healthy fare than the junk food surrounding the college.",2
"I went to Pure Barre for the first time about one month ago.It was a bit intimidating at first. It isn't easy the first time, especially for a beginner like myself. I was so sore after that first class, I mean almost couldn't walk sore. But, I went again, and again.each time I go to a class i get a great work out, and feel great afterwards. I think it is worth trying, and checking out!",2
We rent from 2 budget locations several times a month. We always prepay and book on line. Because to know what u prepaid these guys always try to tack on fees for insurance you did not select. The only reason we still go here is they have best prices. Be sure to double check your bill before you walk away.,1
Be careful.I saw the guy serving the food and handling money. When he will serve my food I asked him to talk to the manger and he said 'I'm the manager ' still I told him the risk of food contamination with the money but he didn't do nothing turn back to the food and keep serving food without washing his hands. nPlace has no FDA licence to be reported !,1
really authentic irish grub. boy does vegas do it right or what. shepards pie is a wonderful minced lamb and really authentic. little disappointed with the chicken curry. was looking for that traditional yellow green pasty sauce and instead got more of a light darker gravy and chicken was not tender. listen to me ! spoiled rotten. run dont walk. terrific homemade brown bread and kerrygold butter.,2
"Very disappointing. Huge TMad fan and went to the Wigwam location for the first time in years. Ordered a chicken teriyaki plate with extra meat which is what I always order and the Durango w.springs and Maryland location. The meat portion was average at best and had 2 bones in it, and they didn't give us the side salad. Will not be visiting that location again.",1
"Took the family out again to Uncle Bear's Grill and bar and again really enjoyed the food with the great service we're accustomed of getting. We don't eat here often, but I will say we have not had a bad experience yet when we pick this restaurant, so I will have to say try it. It's not pricey, again good food and service and a good atmosphere to eat. I recommend it.",2
Loved this place for breakfast off the strip! Wish there was one in San Jose! Check out the back page for the Hawaiian Portuguese and eggs. IT was awesome! Mom old school Hawaiian Japanese loved it big time with eggs and 2 scoops of rice! Coffee and banana muffin was excellent. We bought one to munch on the plane ride home. Excellent friendly service. Definitely a can't miss in Vegas!,2
"Fast food must not be fast anymore.? After a 15 minute drive through wait, I drove up, smiled and said hello. I received a curt glance and a price for my food. I said thank you when I received my food, and the chick turned around and walked away. Thanks for reminding me why I haven't gone to McDonald's in years.",1
"I would highly recommend the lamb curry which is spicy and comes with fragrant basmati rice. The naan is really great too. I also enjoy the aloo tikki appetizer, as well as the samosas. I am not an expert on Indian food so I can't tell you how authentic it is, but I can tell you that it is delicious.",2
"WHAT? 35 bones for lunch for 2? nWtf? If it was quality 'cue, i might give them props, BUT the briscuit had the consistency of warm rubber no render here and the pulled pork had very little smoke and a tad on the dry side. The ONE redeeming part of tne meal was the mac n cheese which was a ""11 ""! but not good enough to elevate its total status.",1
Terrace Cafe is wonderful place for brunch. My husband took me for my birthday brunch and we had lovely time. It was weekend so we had to wait for sometime before we got seating but trust me it was worth the wait. nWe ate so much we could hardly move I guess this is best way to celebrate birthday! I loved their famous Red Velvet Waffles. Great Service and great food!,2
"Great place food was excellent, for the most part. Favorites were the Ahi Tuna skewer, lamb skewer, and chorizo stuffed mushrooms and stuffed dates. Also loved the bread pudding and chocolate tres leches for dessert. Service was also great. Only complaint is the nose level was quite high. Otherwise a great place.",2
"Ok place to hang out for a quick drink but if you actually want to get comped drinks for playing video blackjack poker, forget it after one. We played for quite a while but even with putting more 20's into the machine I was losing, boo! , the waitresses seemed to make a point of ignoring us. So no, not really a favorite place to hang in Vegas.",1
"This is where I had my first sweet potato fries. The brick oven pizzas are great. The service is good. I had a friend drop half a quesadilla on the floor. We asked the waitress for some napkins. After she gave them to us, she came back with half of a quesadilla. They have some interesting beers. I'm not a beer guy, but you might be. I will return to this place.",2
"heard about this place from some friends. went in and was pretty cool to hang.lots of tv's, lot's of beer.sort of stopped there. food was flat french dip was stringy, fatty and cold and the service was almost self service! I can see coming for a game and a beer, but not for a meal.might try again just in case.",1
"One of the best manicures I've had! I'm looking forward to my chip free manicure for days. The guy was very detailed, pleasant and quick. I was in and out as a walk in, in about 35 minutes. They are one of the most convenient in Uptown. Hidden away in the building on the second floor, it's a great find!",2
"My friend and I come here often and it has been consistently delicious! The staff is extremely friendly and the portion sizes are perfect. Food comes out quickly, and is always fresh. We usually get our orders to go, but recently found out that if you dine in you get a complimentary soup. Fantastic!",2
"I've gone to Sherene twice now to get eyelash extensions and am sooo happy w her results! I wanted the Disney Kim Kardashian look and she delivered. Sherene has talent and patience with this process money very well spent. Her application room is so girlie and comfortable you will feel like a princess, I promise!",2
"The Lost Leaf was one of the first places I happened upon in Phoenix. I like this place because it is a little different than everywhere else and permeates a cool, chill atmosphere. I like the small shows they have there with their quaint patio, just don't try to chill there on First Friday, it is a Zoo.",2
"I had the ""angus "" chicken fried steak, eggs, toast, and hashbrowns for breakfast today. Meh. The eggs were cooked right. That was it. The hashbrowns were undercooked and almost raw in someplaces, the chicken fried steak tasted like it was fried in grease that has been used for 4 weeks straight. The toast was big and soggy and only lightly toasted on one side. I won't be back.",1
"Love, LOVE, Love this place. I have missed my Charlotte layovers lately. I have been flying through Philly. Most airports now have a wine bar somewhere. But none are like this. Large, great atmosphere, great food selections and completely reasonable in price. Service is great and Sarah is amazing as a server!",2
"Love the store, NOT HAPPY with the new pharmacy system. Used to get all our prescriptions here at great prices. If a medicine costs less than my copay, they used to charge the actual, lower price. Not any more. Yesterday I had to pay my full 20 copay on a generic medicine that only costs 8. That's just not right. They will not be getting my pharmacy business any more!",1
"I ""M SURPRISED THE REVIEWER BEFORE ME got in so fast. nThe receptionist called to confirm my appt tomorrow but I am going on vacation and didn't make it for the day I leave! the scheduler was so rude and nothing was available until July! I have an weird spot on my scalp and Quite worried so guess how much fun I've had trying to see someone? 2 friends recommended powers but will not be returning.",1
Where should I start? The ridiculous colors they chose the halfway paint the building? Maybe that they can't decide if they are a restaurant as stated on their liquor license or a night club as stated on Christian Nava Cruz's FaceBook. http www.azliquor.gov query results licenseNumber.cfm?licensenumber 12079226 https sphotos a.xx.fbcdn.net hphotos prn1 66999 4244597152749 1112729945 n.jpg,1
"Once my favorite, it no longer seems to have quite the same charm. They used to have some very nice loose leaf teas, but now it's pretty much the same thing you'd find in a store. It seems that some times you get service to your table, other times the call you up to the bar. This shop is going through the right motions but it has lost the intangibles that made it worth driving across town for.",1
"Stopped here after a baseball game for Pizza with the kiddos! nThe pizza was pretty good! nBreadsticks were also fresh and tasty! Its a pizza shop, so there's not much else to report. They do sell beer ToGo and for In house . nSeating for dining is minimal, but it is very clean! I'd def stop in again. Parking can be dicey, though ",2
"They probably save money by hiring people that just got out of prison. You think they'd save enough to at least help out the situation. Reserved my room for a special event, with ZERO mention you need to make the reservation over the phone, instead of online. These people are behind on the times, so let's hope they get left in the dust.",1
"I finally caught up with her at her last weekend in Phoenix about a month ago. This is the real deal for all of us New England transplants looking for authentic seafood.lobster rolls, fried clams with bellies, chowdah, and a variety of other delicious options. I will be following her religiously when she comes back next season.",2
"Only thing less disappointing then the food is the staff. Ordered Chin Wings, Hot Sour soup and Sesame Chicken to go. What I get in return is Chin Wings with the wrong stir fry sauce, a cup of hot sour and lemon chicken. They charged me for what I ordered, yet they still refused a refund me or to replace my food. Avoid this place like the plague.",1
It is so annoying that a FAST FOOD restaurant charges for water I mean seriously when you sit here the atmosphere is bland and boring the employes are not enthusiastic or inviting the restaurant industry should serve hospitality not regret it's quite irritating they need a lot improvement. A good staff is the back bone of a restaurant so a better attitude should result,1
"I probably should have yelped it before I went there. But I was on the road and craving a rice bowl. The place is dark makes it dingy for me and it was so quite for a lunch crowd. Ordered the house chicken togo. The taste of the sauce was weird. not to garlicy, just blah. Very disappointed. Never going back!",1
. The Ovens Are Off . n Looks like Rosati's is looking for someone else . Who lacks pizza talent nThe last Franchisee won't be missed. nOver the past 7 years this was the 3rd or 4th Failed Owner. Serving up a decent pizza . isn't Rocket Science. Here's hoping that Alton Brown . will be the new owner.,1
"It's two scoops of Thrifty's Ice Cream between 2 fresh baked cookies of your choice for like, 4 bucks. Maybe if you just wanted one ice cream sandwich and don't need the temptation of making several more, sooner or later. then yeah, this splurge will do. White tables and chairs are dirty and the floor could use mopping on this late afternoon, since no one else is around. Just saying.",1
How long does it take to make a smothie I wonder? Apparently a long time. how many times can you forget to add the protein boost? At least twice I found out and for two customers in a row. And don't even get me started on the crepe. The end result was good but was it worth the stress and patience and back and forth with the 4 5 employees running around but accomplishing almost nothig? Not sure.,1
"Sushi itself was not bad , but the everything else was not pleasing at all. Environment was very awkward, food was labeled but did not give descriptions of what they consisted of so you did not know what you were eating. You had to wait for specific sushi rolls to be made which took a long time considering the conveyor belt was super slow. Some were not even being made!",1
"Food was OK. Steak was luke warm, and the garlic mashed potatoes. Where's the garlic I questioned if the kitchen was clean after seeing the men's restrooms. The restroom was unsightly, hand towels overflowed from the trash receptacle and the smell was horrific, it appears it was not cleaned from the night before. I think if the restrooms are not clean, what must the kitchen look like.",1
"How have I never reviewed Short Leash? I am so impressed with this food truck. Brad and Kat are always friendly and gracious, even when lines are 40 people long and they're running low on supplies. I've never had anything here that I didn't like. I usually get a chicken dog and it doesn't disappoint! Get anything here. Seriously. You won't regret it!",2
"Looks like a sports bar, sounds like a sports bar, must be a sports bar. Not a restaurant bar. We had the cobb salad. Safeway mixed greens, MAYBE one slice of bacon, one egg, lots of black olives, lots of dry chicken chunks.dry! Some bleu Cheese ""crumbles "" and what they call bleu cheese dressing. nPrice was ok. Salad was SAD! I won't go back, but if you decide to, try the hamburger.",1
"Had take out for the first time. New to Phoenix and Never had such a hard time locating good Chinese. I may have found our north Phoenix Scottsdale fix! Good sesame chicken, Szechuan Beef, excellent fried rice with light use of oil. We will be going back to test the service as that is a major knock that I see online. The reception was friendly although a little slow. We shall see!",2
"Great pizza that's not too pricey. Small place but worth it. The garlic knots were very yummy. I would get them again.and again.and again! The pizza we ordered was very delish. The crust was much better than crusts from places like Pizza Hut, Dominos or Little Cesar's. The location is easily missed, but of you're craving pizza I would suggest giving this place a try.",2
"If you love funky, authentic, inexpensive ""hole in the wall "" ethnic restaurants this is a great stop. It is open super late a lot of Ethiopian cab drivers stop in for grub. They have live music at times. The service was attentive and easy. You get so much food a vegetarian platter for 10 easily feeds 2. A family feel. I would definitely go back.",2
"The 1984's red, yellow, and white lay out sets the stage for their paralyzingly good burgers. After greedily eating my Double Double Animal Style and Well Done Fries that put Shake Shack to shame , I instantly jump on my phone and rub it into my East coast friend's face. I evoke those meals like children recalling Halloween treats, or Christmas presents.",2
I come to the bar area irregularly and it is the greatest! Most of the time they have good live music playing. Kelly and Ashley are the best bartenders! They will make any drink for you so long as you ask them. They even made a drink up for me and it is now my goto drink when I come here. Always love coming here on Wednesdays!,2
I'd give them a 0 if it was possible! They warmed up precooked frozen food and served it. The samosas were Deep jalape u00f1o cheese samosas and the naan were Deep as well. Haleem tasted like it was from a can and the service was just horrible. The restaurant itself is just laughable! Save your money and go else where!,1
This place has got to have THE. WORST. PIZZA. EVER. It was tissue paper thin and absolutely dripping with grease from the pepperoni. I was already at Santa Fe Casino so thought I'd give them a try. I will be speaking to the Manager of the casino to ask him if he as actually tried this place as all the other restaurants are very good in Santa Fe. Don't try Villa Pizza.save yourself!,1
"I've been going to this location for over 10 years! Best calamari fritti in town! And try the spicy sausage rigatoni, you won't be disappointed! And lastly, if you're trying to watch the carbs a bit, you can substitute spaghetti squash for your 'noodle' choice. It does cost a little extra, but it's worth it!",2
"Let me start by saying the people there are very nice, but honestly, Home Depot, your installation prices are outrageous. I am an interior designer and 15 sf for tile installation when the tile itself only costs 1.88 sf is completely insane. I will never ever use them for installation, I could have granite installed on my floor for less than your cheap o ceramic.",1
The fried chicken livers are so tender and good. The chicken is pretty good. nThis place I need to visit more to try other things on the menu. The lemon cake was moist and tasty. I had inquired about it and when I got home there was a piece of lemon cake in my bag free of charge. The nice lady at the register was nice and friendly.,2
"Went to Moira for the first time last night, very cool little spot. I really liked the chairs and the lighting. The food was very good and the sake selection was great. We got a bottle of the coconut sake and it was half price on Thursday! and we loved it. My favorite part about Moira was the impeccable service. We will definitely be back.",2
"Very nice place. I had a pedi and gel manicure here, it took about two hours start to finish and that's with having my nails done at the same time so make sure you have enough time. A lot of pampering and it is worth it. It is very clean inside and does not have a offensive chemical odor like other places. They do a great job and will do special designs on your toes or fingers if you request it.",2
"Horrible. Just horrible. I was so disappointed. Their food taste like crap. I couldn't even finish my meal. I got the chicken plate with enchillada. It just taste bad. The most portion I ate was probably the bean. I don't even eat the bean most time. I eat the rice, but their rice is just bad too. I don't see what the big deal is.",1
This store has become my morning power walk destination .i felt it was a trader joes with expanded aisleways my main beef with trader joe's i like the meat and cheese selection.the prices.hmmm.jury is still out on that one.comparable to trader joe's.the specials probably give f e the upper hand over trader joes. it's a welcome addition to my neighborhood,2
"First time here. Wait time on our food was ridiculous. The server brought us free chips and dip because she felt so bad. The most disappointing part was the manager walked over n didn't even talk to us to apologize about the wait. Literally, our food came out like 45 minutes after we ordered it. Very disappointing.",1
"This is a good place to have a drink if you are in the area. I've had the burgers and gourmet hot dogs and they are above average. Solid selection of draught beer and bottles, but you've likely had the majority of them already. It's a clean, well lit place, with a small patio. I'm down the street from so I'll likely hit it up here and there, but not really worth going out of your way for.",2
"One of the few places I've been able to find pipe tobacco. Wish the employees were friendlier. I've been to this location twice and while the second visit was better than the first, I still felt uncomfortable. Employee wasn't overly helpful and made me feel stupid for asking questions or like I was bothering him. I'll be back I'm sure, but I don't look forward to coming in here.",1
"Good addition to the restaurant scene in Scottsdale however, this restaurant is somewhat hard to find since it is set back from Scottsdale Road. The service was good, the atmosphere was nice and the food was quite tasty albeit quite spicy. Our server warned us, but I wasn't prepared for how spicy it would really be be warned!",2
"We had a group of 5 gals pretty good looking girls, if I do say so myself! D waiting outside to get into Surrender around 1 AM. Firstly there was no one there. No line. And 5 chicks, let's do the math here. You want to charge us 30 for each girl? And then you want to let 4 of us in for free and make the 5th girl pay? I'm not really sure how that makes ANY sense. Surrender, you be tripping.",1
"We went in looking for a straight razor! There was some chick also in the same section bending over with her butt crack out! But the sales person, was looking at us like we were going to steal something! Really! We, me and my husband.look like were going to steal something! I will never go back in the store again! That wasn't cool lady!",1
"Sure, I didn't have to give Tryst a dime of my money, but the heat and the crowding alone made me want to leave within an hour of arriving. If you wanted to dance, you couldn't because it was so packed that you were lucky you could breathe. Even the outdoor waterfall area was packed. We ended up leaving quickly and drinking bottles of wine at Parasol Up.",1
"I have tried to support local business but every time I have gone into Monty's he seems all stressed out. You don't have the freedom to play an instrument, everything is out of reach so you leave because you think you may be bothering the man. Plus his time signs 10ish to 6ish, you never know if he will return. Not a way to run a music store.",1
"I came here a few times a month a year ago when I lived on this side of town. It was so good! I would always get fried chicken, rice n gravy, and mashed potatoes. I came back a few months ago I went and the food wasn't the same. Not sure if they changed recipes or the cooks weren't trained properly, but I was so disappointed.",1
"First time here and I'll definitely be back for news. Excellent lunch specials! 9 for two sushi rolls, salad, rice, and dumplings. Instead of two sushi rolls, my kiddo had chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu. She loved both but didn't care of the katsu sauce . They have a good assortment of rolls, the restaurant was clean, and the staff friendly. Well done Momo!",2
Worst company ever. I read the reviews here which were good reviews and decided to go ahead and try this company for my trip to Vegas in October. I sent several requests on their website emailed and called without a reponse back. Isnt this suppose to be about customer service. I guess this company either dont like to make money or dont care about their customers. I so hate to be ignored.,1
I was forced to be at a table on Friday night by the bouncer in order to get in without waiting in line. Another guy at the table terrorized me and was extremely hostile and aggressive with me. I told the bouncers but I don't think anything happened. This is not a safe place for a beautiful woman. The guys get off on bullying petite women.,1
If I could give 0 star I would. Waygu? I don't think so. It tasted like crap on a plate. My steak was over cooked and the wait staff did not even come by once asking how our meal was coming along. I would have voiced my concerned right then and there. As I'm writing this post they haven't even come by at all to check up on us. Disappointed. ill go back to Costa Mesa locatioext time.,1
"Owner is crazy, actually really like the food there veggies that is , but won't ever go again. I've never felt so uncomfortable or offended as I did the last time I visited this place. I could write a book about this experance, but really is there a need? Clearly I'm not the only one. Owner was rude.",1
"Where'd that come from? Reminds me of the brothel in the model town from Beatlejuice. A tourist trap, cookie cutter ""authentic Mexican Cantina "" located on the strip. They have a Margarita bar with slushy machines spinning and some allegedly hot wings. Unfortunately it's a dive bar that's been polished up and shoved into a tourist locale.",1
"I can say with confidence I will not be back, after eating here I had food poisoning leaving me with my head in a bucket and running to the bathroom for dear life, it's a fast food type of sushi which makes you wonder how long they actually keep it on the conveyer belt, it's a poor excuse and fortunately they will not see me again.",1
"Nice to have a new brewery in the neighborhood. I will give them a break, they have not been open long. The food was average to good. Staff seemed a bit disorganized, service was average. i will go back, wanna see if they iron out some of the mdeocrity. This place has great potential and I hope it helps to revitalize the neighborhood around it.",2
"Worst service ever. I ordered one original combo, one flafel wrap and grape leaves. The lady charged me 5.25 instead of 2.25 for the grape leaves and forgot the fries. Just found it out at home. When drove back to the restaurant they were already closed with the lights off. this is second time she messed up. Worse thing is I tipped her for food. Hell. good food but dont wanna go back ever.",1
"Sorry kids, I hate to dumb this down but we read about Dino's and were shocked to find it as a cinder block, boring bar in the middle of the wretched strip befor even downtown. At night when it fills up with crazy drunks it might appeal to somebody but not me. Dean Martiever drank here, for a reason.",1
"This place is great. The food is very good not great but the atmosphere makes up for it. Simple italian menu written on the wall or you can read it on a menu. You have two choices of all you can drink wine, red or white. I make a point to come here every time I am in Vegas. I often bring groups of customers here for some thing a little different. Don't forget to tip the squeeze box player.",2
Head out at happy hour and try all of their happy hour appetizers. I love the sesame seed ahi tuna. nTheir hamburgers are delicious and so are the salads. I go up about once a week and pig out and have some big beers. I recommend this over any other restaurant in the area if you're looking for a romantic and tasty meal.,2
Ordered the pork fish sinigang. it tasted like the soup was ready made then they just added the meat in when its ordered so the meat tastes bland. doesn't absorb the sauce because they cook it separately. My dad went there last week and said the food wasn't good either. they take to many short cuts to save money. then the taste of the food suffers.,1
"Big wong, so right! Loved loved the beef tendon ""ramen "". It was the clear kind and the broth was sooo good. The noodles are true to the rameame. Chewy, delicious, but more the kind you find in japanese noodles, not hong kong chinese style beef stew. The rest of the items were good but if you come, come for the beef stew ramen for sure.",2
So after a year of staying away we thought we would give Nacho Daddy's another chance and I have to tell how pleased we were with the food and the service. My wife had the chicken Nachos and I had the Three cheese Enchilada dinner and we were really surprise. I would recommend Nacho Daddy's to every one!,2
"Arnold Palmers with southern style sweet tea? Check! nDog treats given out in the drive through when they see a furball in the car? Yes! nAmusing, if cheesy, welcomes to the restaurant? Indeed! nPleasant staff? Yep! nTasty food at reasonable prices? That too! When I'm not feeling up to cooking, this is my go to place for sure.",2
"Excellent example of commercialized hip hop. Nas needs to come back to see how they are running this without him there because I doubt he would be pleased. Employees are rude, they charged me twice on accident and refused to refund me, prices are high, and the whole place just has a very unwelcoming snotty attitude.",1
"Great food. Crappy service. We ordered. Then we checked out the coffee menu for forever, got coffees, drank the large coffees, searched through all the beer, went to the bathroom, and still waited for a long time to get our food! And we were the only ones there! What takes so long?! Every time I've been here I've waited for a long time. For drinks, food, and the check! No thank you.",1
"The only reason it's 2 stars is because the food is decent. Otherwise, totally unimpressed! It's my birthday, I'm in Vegas and the service here sucks. We're a party of 2 and I've seen literally 5 other tables be seated, be served their meals and here we sit still waiting on ours. Didn't order anything special or extraordinary. Totally disappointed.",1
"Another great addition to Central Phoenix! I absolutely love the atmosphere and decor of this place.wouldn't furnish my house this way, but totally appreciate and love it! The staff was super friendly and helpful with suggestions. The food was great we tried 6 different kinds of tacos and ordered a few sides too. The agua fresca was amazing.combo of pineapple and strawberry yummy!",2
"Delicious and inexpensive Mexican food! Fausto's is similar to Roberto's taco shops, but for some reason. their food tastes a little bit better! I especially love the bar filled with salsas and different yummy things. I always wondered why cucumbers were a part of the bar area until my friend taught me to put them in a bag with salt, lime juice and salsa. So good!",2
One of the best places in Vegas off the strip for all you can eat. The other place is called Sushi mon and they share the same owner lol. The all you can eat menu is extensive. The service is pretty good as well. They are very cautious with customers over ordering because they don't like to waste food. I believe you have to pay for anything you do not finish.,2
I've now gone to this location twice and both times they have been sold out of most of their donuts and only had plain ones remaining. I've gone in the mornings both times when they should have donuts available. I know it's a new location so i'll cut them some slack but they should be ready to sell. For now I'll go to the Arizona ave and ray location and give this one some time to get ready.,1
Good place to watch the game but nothing else. Lots of TVs around. The food is whatever's. It is bar food. The garlic fries were super greasy. The chili cheese fries tasted good. And they use cheese whiz. The Philly cheese steak lacked flavor. Burgers sandwiches are about 16 each and don't even come with fries. It's super expensive here.,1
"Little confused here. tried to get a hot dog from the cart outside the Fargo last week, when the lady saw me coming she was on her cell phone she hid behind the grill and didn't address me, so I walked away and went to another dog stand. is this the way they normally do business with the hot dog cart?",1
"Ok, so I may have been in an altered state of conciousness when I hit up Fatburger. Not so much from the alcohol per se, but from the pain in my feet from walking about 34 miles from the bar at another hotel back to mgm. In heels. nAll I know is that fatburger was like the oasis in the desert. Onion rings and a ginormous milk shake was perfection.",2
"Dreadful service, especially from store owner and manager who put me in wrong sized athletic shoe after foot surgery. No responsibility on owner's part for store's mstake she became argumentative when I requested a refund. I've had much better service at SAS, The Walking Company and Crocs. All of these stores offer well made and more reasonably priced shoes, too.",1
"I came here about a year ago and the food and service were great. Stopped by for breakfast today and was instantly brought to a table. Sat there for over 15 minutes without anyone coming over, even to get a drink order. The two tables next to us had waitresses constantly checking on them. We got up and left, won't be coming back here. Customer service goes a long way.",1
"Horrible company. Took my address, name and phone and then didn't send a cab. Called back 20 min later to inquire, and was told that he had forgotten and that I was now number one in queue. Called back 20 min after that and was told they probably couldn't get me a car as they were too busy. Would have beeice to know that 45 minutes ago. Thanks guys. Grade A service.",1
"Ok tried to eat at monta five times this past week and the lines and the wait times were very long. Tatsu ramen is now my go to ramen joint and can always get seated. Well, until everyone else finds out how good this place is. Definitely the ambience is much nicer since you don't have to look at people staring at you waiting for tables to open up. They also offer excellent Gyoza and curry too.",2
"Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. The decor is nice and the waitress was very pleasant. nWe had the baked muscles and a few of the rolls. The death valley, Cucumber roll, the daisy and fat ass were all very good. n3 of us ate for 70.00 that encluded drinks, sushi and desert. Was not disappointed and will be going back again.",2
"Just randomly stopped by the container park today for the first time. My wife and I had no idea this place was here and decided to try it. We ordered the raw ""chicken "" salad wraps, and the tlc juice. We normally wouldn't order a juice but thought we would give it a chance. And we loved it! The chicken salad is now our new favorite food in Las Vegas! GO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT! You won't regret it!",2
"I love that this place has a Saturday happy hour! We came for drinks and an appetizer before going out and it was great! The decor is super fun to watch. They had a move playing in the background as well. Lots of servers were around to help others too! The drinks were yummo and the food was great, we had sweet potato fries. I will totally be back!",2
The customer service here is amazing! Friendly employers in my book goes a very long way. And if it's important to you too then this is the coffee shop for you too. Not only that but they have the best caramel frapp ever! Compared to Starbucks Dutch bros it's a no brainier. Red hut is by far way more delectable! Have yet to try their hot coffee but I'm sure I will very soon!,2
"Just moved here from vermont looking for great pizza and wings. Well we found it. Pizza is hot crisp tasty. Wings hot, spicy , like i like them to be, staf is friendly and know how to take care of their customers. They sre quick snd keep your drinks full and bus the table. Nice. Keep up the good work.",2
"Had a great time in here. Good build out, weird outfits on the staff especially the hostesses . My husband loved the sliders and the truffle Mac Cheese was good I'd strengthen the truffle flavor a little and lighten it up couldn't finish it . Specialty cocktails were outstanding! Service was good think they are still working out the kinks.",2
"Disappointing. Wagyu beef was cooked medium, as ordered, but I guess it was just not good quality to begin with. There was nothing in taste or texture to suggest, that it was anything else, then your typical angus and mediocre one at that. Sides of Brussels sprouts and mushrooms were both basically ruined too salty and sour. nAppetizer of dungeness crab carpaccio was ok, but not outstanding.",1
"You won't forget or regret it. Everything was done beautifully. The story line was clear and easy to follow. The visuals were dreamy and surreal. The music brought everything together. My travel companion, who had seen a Vegas Cirque show Zumanity and absolutely hated it, loved this and agreed that it was worth every penny. The visuals and stunts are amazing. Seriously you won't forget it.",2
"Terrible breakfast. I chose the simplest dish. Potatoe was cold, breakfast sausage was not fully thawed. Egg was OK. The toast came with frozen butter. At least i got normal coffee and lots of jam! nService was average. Decor and background music above average. nGo somewhere else for food. I cant comment on their coffee though.",1
Have been at this location many times over the past 10 months mostly during the AM hours on Saturday. Service was fairly quick. The fill up on the coffee could be quicker. Food was good and sometimes very good for breakfast items. Look for a generous coupon in local mailers and you'll be hard pressed to find a better deal for what IHOP can deliver.,2
"This was our first and last visit. I ordered a club sandwich and asked for extra pickles and the waitress had to ask how much they will charge. Half a buck for one pickle spear. I'm not cheap but that's tacky nickel and dime, oh I'm sorry half a buck. BS. Did I mention 25 min to get our meal wheot that busy?",1
"We spent a few hours here while visiting the city. We especially enjoyed the Sports Museum and the Heinz exhibit that just opened. We also spent some time in the gift shop, which has unique items and fun gifts. We also appreciated the architecture of the building and how the museum was laid out. Easy to find what you were looking for. I would recommend it to others visiting Pittsburgh.",2
"Very poor service, ordered tile from them which they were supposed to have in inventory it wasn't. Told us it was coming from Italy and would be around 4 weeks. 6weeks later not here. Latest excuse was tile container didn't get loaded on to the ship after all. Order cancelled, using someone else to source our tile.",1
"Went on a Friday for lunch for the first time. Small hole on the wall type restaurant with 5 small tables and a counter. Employees are super friendly and responsive. I had the consume loco and the tacos cochinita pibil. Both were very delicious! The soup starts off a little bland but throw in a few scoops of green salsa, a couple of the red and a squeeze of lime and now we're talking!",2
"For my friend's bachelorette party, a group of 8 of us went here. We were all dressed up nice and none of us had gotten rowdy drunk yet. The bouncer was polite enough but straight up told me he wouldnt let us in because we were women. I asked him if we all stood with a man in line and came in with a man could we get in? He told me no. What a disappointment! Obviously won't recommend this place.",1
"Most comfortable and elegant vapor shop in Las Vegas! These guys have taught me so much about vaping I give them partial credit for me quiting cigarettes. Thanks you guys! I forgot to mention the eliqcube french roast! I can't thank you guys enough for introducing me to my all day vape, and at an amazing price to boot! Check out vapology ASAP!",2
"Tempe pub staple, as the Phoenix area goes, Casey Moore's is pretty good. The atmosphere is hipster, arty but you won't be judged when you go. The patio is great during nice weather and the food is good enough. The wait staff always has a bit of a ""holier than thou "" attitude, but it won't distract from the overall experience. I met my husband here, so it holds a special place in my heart!",2
"This is probably the most appalling buffet I've ever seen in Las Vegas! Do not eat here! The quality is abysmal at best and the food is dry and has sat on the bar a bit too long. The customer service along with the decor is ok, but I would definitely love to be at the MGM sipping on mimosas with creme brulee and meaty crab legs.",1
We stopped in for lunch and to see if we would enjoy coming here for an evening of live music and dining. I couldn't relax and enjoy the experience because everything I touched had something sticky on it. We sat at a different table and it was no cleaner. For me cleanliness is is must have. Sorry we won't be able to enjoy an evening here.,1
"Very disappointing. I ordered the chickeachos as an appetizer, it was horrible! Most probably the worst I've ever had! My son asked for sour cream on the side with his meal and was charged 3.00! They also charge 4.50 for a cup of sopa de fideo, an item that is free of charge at Lindo Michoacan when ordering an entree . Lastly, my husband's stomach did not agree with the food.",1
"There are two kinds of hotels, those that have real hangers and those that have hangers permanently attached to the rod. I guess if you're worried about your clientele stealing your hangers, you don't have time to do things like update your rooms more than once every 30 years. Or clean them. This place looks like a mediocre set of off campus apartments at a big university.",1
"i ordered a large italian sub and a large sicilian special, both were coated in black on the crust.clean your ovens.the sub may just have been the worst i have ever ate.subway is better if that means good the pizza itself was just ok.the staff was nice but unfortunatley that's not enough to take me back again",1
"Good location and broad range of choices on the buffett. Service was adequate, price wasn't too bad, and a few of the buffett items were quite good. Only downsides I've experienced are the occasional use of french fries on the buffett as ""vegetable pakoras "". Unacceptable. Also, not all of the buffett selections were put out and I was there a good 30 minutes after opening.",2
"To be completely honest Wal mart is wal mart for starters. Secondly, This is by far the worst Wal mart location in Charlotte, NC. This is the worst because of the whole location and trying to travel in this little parking lot. It is surprisingly clean. If i didn't just move so close to this Wal mart and so far from another one I would not go to this wal mart.",1
"I am not a fan. There's always salespeople trying to sell you something. It's spooky and dark. I was on a mission to find craft beer, no luck. Since Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay, I found myself just walking around and checking stuff out. I like looking at the Luxor from the outside, but, eh.there's no reason that compels me to stay.",1
"I have not been to the dentist in a long time. I recently went to Downtown Dental. Everyone was very friendly the hygienist, the dentist, and the receptionist. The office is very nice, clean, and very conveniently located. I showed up about 5 minutes early and was greeted and seen without a wait. I will definitely be going back.",2
"I think this is a brilliant example of running a bar based purely on location rather than on good quality of food and service. I had doubtful pleasure to visit this place again after Michael Nyman's concert. Food cold, drinks overpriced and poor service. Staff was interested only in counting minutes until they'd finish their shift. Very unpleasant experience.",1
"This place is a run down dump. I felt like l was going to get a mersa infection just sitting at the table. The food is terrible, even for lndian food. The buffet is over priced. There are some great Indian places in Phoenix and this is not one. You can just tell that they do things as cheap as possible and don't care about quality. My guess is that the chef is mexican and not lndian! Move along.",1
"This place is great.provided that you are getting take out. First, the food is great and the portions are good sized. However, dining in here will make you feel as though you are unwanted. I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing, but there definitely isn't any effort to make you feel ""at home. "" All in all Get take out, enjoy your food, and skip dining in. It's the food that brings you back.",2
"Home Goods is a dream place for anybody wanting to refresh their decor or just starting out. The possibilities are endless and the prices are unbeatable. The staff at the Sharon Roads store are so friendly and eager to help. so the only complaint I have is if you see something you are thinking about , you better buy it , because it won't be there when you go back.This is my favorite store in town.",2
Called them at before their closing time to order for pick up. I guess they decide when the close because it wasn't 10pm and that's when they say they close on Saturday night.after 22 take out orders from this new location since they opened I guess they will be losing my business now. Masa.when are you open and closed? When you decide.put it on your website so people can order food when your open.,1
"Don't go there! It's the worst stay I ever had! My room got broken into the first night I was there and they stole my briefcase! The staff must of tipped off the thieves cause when I reported the incident they really couldn't care , I had to really complain. What a horrible experience! No security at all at this hotel, if you decide to stay there, bring a body guard lol",1
First of all I love Chipoltle just not this one! On many a Friday night they are usually out of one ore more items at 6 30 which is ridiculous! We ALWAYS have an issue with this location. The food is great but something is not clicking here. Hope someone reads this that can fix the problem in the kitchen. Until then I'm going to Moe's!,1
"I was very happy with the speed, price and quality of the work done here. I had some half soles and heels replaced on my leather dress shoes. They work was really good. The service was fast and convenient. I will most likely bring any other repairs back to here, even though its not on an easy side of town for me to get to.",2
"With so many great pizza options in Ahwatukee, and throughout the rest of the valley, it surprises me that Mellow Mushroom thrives and survives. We did not enjoy our pizzas they were under cooked, soggy, and the toppings were low quality. Totally not worth the money! Two stars for good service and a nice beer selection.",1
"Went with a groupon Probably the most disappointed i have been with one. I am not sure what I had as it did not resemble what I had ordered I thought anyway and it was tasteless. I just wanted to be done and really did not want to order anything else. I have tried many Mexican restaurants in the valley and this has been my only disappointment, normally I am pleasantly surprised. Sorry folks.",1
"I normally go here during lunch, mainly for the subs. Well today I go an try a salad. Chicken finger salad. Nice looking salad, I say looking is because as I sit here at my desk lookin at this salad because the staff failed to give me silverware or anything to eat with. Wtf . stick to the subs unless u like see food lol",1
"as far as vegas hotels go the 4 queens is close to the bottom of the barrel. the room we had had old beds, a bed with no bedspread, holes in the blankets, etc. the sports book is nonexistent, no more than a counter and a tv in the ceiling. we had to sit at a slot machine to watch the game. we got comped for the room because the goldeugget was full but free was too much for this place. stay away.",1
"I ordered their lunch specialty, prime rib sandwich. A roast beef sandwich from subway probably has about the same amount of flavor as this thing did. All I could do to try and awaken my taste buds was lather on some horseradish and au jus. Maybe I picked the wrong item, but when I order a 15 sandwich I expect quite a bit above average, and this sandwich was average at best.",1
"WOW! This is a great place to go, this is another place that I will visit over and over again. Very authentic, reasonably priced, great service and great atmosphere. One of us had the asada taco's which were great, the other had the quesadilla which was also excellent, very filling though with the mexican style cheese. Both were cooked to perfection.",2
"As usual, the collard greens were hit or miss. And this time was another ""miss "". Waaayyy too peppery! Also as usual, the side dishes for one of the guests in my party didn't come out until after THREE requests for them.and probably 15 minutes after chicken waffles came out. The waffles were underdone. Finally, as usual, the service was spotty.",1
"I recently went to Firefy due to a friends recommendation. The food was amazing, the atmosphere rocked and my waiter was really knowledgeable about the menu plus really attentive. Every time we needed a refill on a drink or a napkin he was right there. On my next visit to Vegas I will definitely go again.",2
"I enjoyed this place in the 90's. But I really don't see why it still exists. Does anyone buy CD's anymore? I can get any DVD BluRay I want on Ebay. If I wanted tacky trinkets I could go to some place like Spencer's in the mall or Red Hot Robot if I fancied myself ""cool. "" Perhaps its time Zia faded away like the VCR or countless other pieces of 20th century technology.",1
"Came here to eat with two kids. Ordered meals that would qualify us getting two FREE kids' meals but credited only ONE. The excuse was that I would have to buy two sides if I wanted to get two free kids' meal. There's nothing stating about ordering sides on the promotional add that was posted on the window. What a bunch of BS! If they are pulling that stunt, theo more trips to JR.",1
"This place is cute, but that's about it! Everything is made from cake mixes, nothing is from scratch, not even the frosting! Ew. You're better off going to safeways bakery than here to be honest. It's overpriced poor quality, boring tastes and really they only have cakes. nI'm a pastry chef, so I like to think I know what I'm talking about! ",1
We have been searching for good Thai food in Mesa and finally we found it! The curry is amazing and the beef is amazing! We tried a dish with delicious peanut sauce over beef and vegetables and now I can't stop thinking about it. This place will definitely become our regular spot. We can't wait to try more on the menu!,2
"I've been here many times since my original review and they are consistent! I met my wife here for lunch on a Monday and it felt like a secret little rendevous! Meeting at a hidden diner tucked away into a little regional airport, crossing the tarmac to get to the restaurant, watching folks hop in to their little planes and taxi away.",2
Probably the best Breakfast buffet. You get 90 minutes to eat. So I suggest coming in at 9 30 AM and staying for lunch. I loved their ham pineapple. The omelette station was okay. I don't like the sharp Cheddar. They should use something less strong. maybe low moisture Mozzarella instead. Still very good I'm a big fan of their breakfast buffet. The service was really good too.,2
"There's only so many ways you can show someone taking off their clothes. The unifying theme is weak at best, and Holly Madison is pretty terrible. The girls are all beautiful, and talented dancers, but over all the show just isn't fun. If you are looking for an adult show that is worth your time and money see Zumanity",1
The food was a really tasty and reasonably priced. Not much Cuban food that I am aware of in the area and this one is a nice start. Interesting decor but who cares when the food and quality of it is that good. The level of care of the chef was nice they came out to chat and gave us some gaspacho to try that they were making for that evening. I'd definitely go back for the empinadas.,2
"Oh Lord, they changed the menu. We had the calamari which was excellent, loved the sauce and presentation. The stuffed shrimp was a huge miss, skip them. The ribeye was as wonderful as ever with fried onion petals on top. Fish was really good but those hush puppies are the star. Always a great meal.",2
"We see Dr. Vockley for my son's genetic disorder VLCADD in addition to our local geneticist. He's great and the staff at Children's have always been pleasant to work with. The facility is very large and I've had to ask for directions more than once, but it's not overwhelming and, like I mentioned, the staff is friendly and will quickly direct you to where you need to go.",2
"This place was fantastic. We were a little early for our res, so we went to grab a drink at the bar. The bartender was great, both before and after dinner we just had to stop back . The menu was delicious and the mini desserts were amazing. Make sure to try their homemade strawberry vodka and prosecco! Delish!",2
I would give Red Rock 5 Stars if they had more of a late not deal. Im new to this side of town. And im use to 1 midnight bowling at South Point. But I do love the lanes and how well maintained everything is here. The staff pretty much pays attention to everything. I've been here several times and I'll keep coming back,2
"Love, love, love Trader Joe's. Everyone I've gone to has the best stuff. I love their microwave brown rice, their individual salads so many varieties your sure to find something you like and their fruits I got some really great tasting oranges here . If you go to any Trader Joe's your sure to find something unique and interesting and of course always good.",2
Usps is what it is. Kinda slow and a little annoying. This place has really bizarre hours. I feel everytime I come here needing to post something they close early or open late. I think there is only one person that actually works here. Also before they open there seems to be always a line. n nIs what it is,1
Came here for the Saints Lions game a couple days ago w a few friends and I'm glad we did! We got a nice table outside in the patio area where we had the tv right in front of us. It was also happy hour so we got great deals on drinks and appetizers. I recommend the dirty chips. those were really good. Our server was nice and chill. I would definitely come back. I had an awesome time.,2
ok. Emily FORCED me . yeah that's right. FORCED me to eat the mushroom appetizer they were serving at the YELP Birthday Party. It was actually REALLY good! I don't eat mushrooms due to my mom forcing them down my throat while I was a kid. I actually tasted it and ate the whole thing! If my wife reads this or anyone else. you can call her and ask for yourself! ,2
"Their donuts are really good, so are their smoothies. It's honestly the only good donut place in phoenix Scottsdale, but I dread going there because of the employees. They have zero customer service skills. I always feel like I'm putting them out. Awful way to do business. I wish there was a different 24 hour donut shop around town.",1
"Reasons why I love this market It's close to my house nIt's not on a Saturday morning nVendors are always so friendly nIt's never crowded Compared to other markets, there aren't many vendors. It works for me because it has the basics I always get fresh herbs, eggs, tea tamales. I'd love to see more produce but all in all, I think this is a really great little market.",2
"We wondering around the forum shops in Ceasars and we got a bit hungry and decided to stop at Trevi. It was a great experience. We were seated by the outside fountain and our waitress rocked. Shee recommended both of our dishes which were the Veal Parm and A seafood specialty that had lobster, clams, shrip, scallops and pasta. Very Deliteful meal. Highly recommend it",2
"No genuine customer hospitality from management, I ordered from this place everyday, and even ordered more than their normal rate as a reliable customer I got no love. If your looking for a warm welcoming, this is not the place unfortunately. Very sad as I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt. But in reality, no true love to their loyal customers which I was once was.",1
"It's pricier for the quality I ordered nI ordered the fish of the day Mahi Mahi, 28 it was undercooked and subpar. I had better expectations. I've also had the pizza and the crust is like their bread which is stellar but the cheese is also subpar. Bring your own wine is a positive part but I won't recommend this place.",1
"Love this hotel, I have stayed here twice now. It's clean, the bed was amazing, and it's close to the Aria, Cosmo and Bellagio. My only complaint is the shower door leaks water every time you use it due to poor design. But just throw some towels down and you're all set! I will definitely be staying here again.",2
Delicious! The meat is tender and everything is fresh. I had the torta and it was amazing. I love the set up of this place. I haven to say that originally even though the set up is nice I was a bit sceptical but they exceeded my expectations. I absolutely recommend this place to my friends. I work at zappos so it looks like i found a new spot for lunch!,2
"Decor is beautiful, especially when it's island themed. They have GREAT alcoholic drink selections to beers, cocktails to different flavored coladas. It's really pricey over here, but I think trying out this place is good to try at least once. Thumbs up for this place to be Groupon friendly. It helps a lot with the expensive prices. Good customer service too. ",2
"The burgers are just ok, they aren't great. The shakes are horrible though. We have given this place the benefit of the doubt in hopes that it would get better three times now. Every time we have gone we have ordered shakes and every time they have been icy and gross. Honestly, the price is great here, unfortunately the cheap price also means cheap quality.",1
"Victoriya made me the most watery milkshake I have ever had, When I told her that the milkshake was very watery she said I should have told her I wanted it thick. This was news to me as I was not aware of this condition in all of my years enjoying milkshake. For 7.99 it was not worth it. Bad service and bad product.",1
"As soon as I walked into this place, I knew I was at home. Having worked in a body shop, I was familiar with paints, etc. However, their selection of products blew away my favorite auto body supply store in Chicago Erkert Bros. in Blue Island . The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and give you very rapt attention when you are looking for something.",2
"Service sucks! Staff is talking to patrons, and having conversations and not observing other customers who need drinks! Waited for 20 mins at the bar for drinks! Had to go inside to get one, and even then waited for 5 mins and it wasn't even that busy! Go some where else where bartenders care about serving their customers! Service sucks!",1
The service was casually formal which was a nice change from too much attention. The wood fired pizza was crunchy around the edges and had GREAT Italian seasoning even on the Hawaiian. The Fruitti DE Mare was delicious with a white wine sauce. None of seafood was overcooked as is so common lately. Will go back again and see what other great dishes they have!,2
"I HATE YOU ! YOU RUINED MY LIFE ! Well , i was that angry that the second time i went to this location for pot pie, they were out second time they said machine died so got the breast meal. got it home and received the 2 meals both breasts were definitely sitting around for a few hours.just vile. 11 wasted on crap. my advise LOOK ELSEWHERE",1
"I like Red Lobster but not this location. I got some kinda food poisioning from the Shrimp alfredo from the Southern Ave. location. If you wanna know what kind of bathroom experience I had after Red Lobster, just pour yourself a big bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and let it sit for 2 hours and then throw it against the wall. You then get the sight and sound.",1
"sorry to say you lose a star and a half luv it and i spoke so highly of you and your frozen gold,well i was so dissapointed last night i had the mint chip custard i have been wanting since we found this place and it was all melty i made a mess allover the car with the melted custard that they served me. they must have had there tempature on the freezer wrong or something. so disapointing.",2
"I'd give 0 stars if I could. Rude, rude, rude. It's as if we should be lucky enough to be served a scoop of freezer burned ice cream. Every flavor has a coating of ice on it. The mint chip was so icy, that she was using a spatula to pry it out. We canceled our order mid scoop and left. Do not bother with her terrible attitude and old ice cream.",1
"I took my Eureka vacuum and asked them to please let me know if it was worth saving or if I needed a new one. They were professional and thorough. Unclogged it, added a new belt and cleaned it up so it looks and works like new. 59 was well worth the investment if I get another year of service out of it. Thank you!",2
Nasty. Absolutely worst food I've ever eaten. No joke. This is pretty much Taco Bell cheap cheap food substitute. They put cheap bagged cheese on every dish including chips and guac. We threw over half our food away because I felt sick eating it. Seriously there are FAR better authentic taco shops close by that are fantastic. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. However the customer service was friendly and quick.,1
"Le Thai is definitely my new favorite Thai place. We had to wait a little bit to get a seat but they'll take your phone number and call you if you want to wander around downtown while you wait. The pad thai, awesome noodles they are named awesome for a reason and waterfall beef were all delicious. I can't wait to go back and try everything else.",2
"I had a horrible experience at this restaurant! They put meat in a vegetarian dish I ordered then when I had to go back and return the food, they acted like it was no big deal. They don't respect other people's views. It was a disgusting and terrible experience I had to go through by deciding to try this restaurant. Don't go through what I did. Just go somewhere else.",1
Friendly family fun business! Coffee was exceptional! Service was attentive and FAST! Served French Vanilla Creamer. Served everything in the menu so I could get a hamburger and my daughter could get the Philly Cheese Steak Burrito and my husband could get Waffles. The Bacon was perfectly cooked with a nice thick rind. Get there early or prepare to wait cuz it is popular but worth it.,2
"This is a solid donut shop, nothing mind blowing. It is not bad ,but not great as far as donuts go. Service very friendly and cheer full which is nice especially in the morning to start your day. n I had a glazed twist, Cinnamon roll and cruller everything was good . Solid 3 stars plus 1 star for the excellent service and the free donut holes they threw in.",2
"Love the selection of cheese and charcuterie to start. and the olives are delicious as well. They have some tasty and creative house drink options. i go for anything that contains whiskey, so i was happy. The entrees were a good size, a fair price, and tasty. And the blueberry cheesecake dessert was delicious. Thanks for the fun meal!",2
"Good for an oil change, but nothing else. Went to get AC fixed spent around 1700. After some back and forth and several visits, they did install a new condenser however, they did not flush my system must be done when changing any part of AC . I finished the job myself, which I was trying to avoid. AC works now. Never going back!",1
So I spoke to the General Manager about the key they broke and they are refusing to pay to replace it because their employees have lied and said the key was broken when I gave it to them. Which is impossible because you can't start to car with a broken key. So now I'm going to take them to Small Claims Court. Ugh! If it was possible for me to give no stars I would.,1
"Surprisingly excellent espresso! Wow, I'm really impressed. Free wi fi and ample space makes this a perfect workplace. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the TV on in the corner that only provides visual distraction with no sound. The music is also very non coffee shop ish a little obnoxious but that's not a big deal. Definitely coming back when the next deadline rolls around!",2
"Very rude store owner, called with a question and she told me ""I am Closed "" I was calling to get information on the store before I made a 1 hour drive there, hours, etc., she again, rudely says ""I said, I am closed! "" Wow, she lives up to the bad reputation given at other scrapping stores crops by customers. I guess I can take all my scrapbooking business elsewhere.",1
Gamble here but have not stayed here yet. But with our friends that had their rooms this is their favortie place to stay in Vegas. I really liked hanging out here too. The whole feelling of Ocean's Eleven and everyone here is definitely not Ghetto. My amn said that we would try this place next time. Can't wait!,2
"Terrible service at ticket counter, a friend bought complimentary tickets for me and they would not provide because I was not the same person who purchased them so I had to cancel the order and put them on my credit card. Employees terribly rude and unhelpful and made me late for show. The show was good if you can avoid the terrible service issues.",1
"Very creative menu. The venue is comfortable with a large dining room with 30 ft ceiling so the noise level is not bad. It has a bar section which seemed comfy and inviting. Ken, our server, was knowledgeable and polite. He had excellent knowledge of the menu and made great suggestions. I had chicken with avocado, rice and black beans.Yum! I'd go back in a heartbeat.",2
I enjoyed the wine and the food but my experiences with the servers have repeatedly left a bad taste in my mouth. nI wish that they had some help that didn't treat you like a second class citizen. I don't go anymore for this reason. If I wanted to be treated like I was nothing but an oxygen sponge I could probably do it much cheaper.,1
"The selections of dishes offered have minimal variety, especially compared to the other buffets. The quality of the food is basic . At best, it tastes like good cafeteria food. However my biggest complaint is that both my sister and I got food poisoning after eating there for brunch lunch. I think it was the crab legs which were dry and salty ",1
Food was amazing and just the right portions. Wait staff was great and attentive and very personable. Only downside I would say was the wait time just to check in. Also they didn't seem like their tech was making things go any faster with managing tables and customers in or outbound. It actually seemed to hinder the operation.,2
"Great Korean food in Squirrel Hill. The spicy bulgogi and baby octopus are my particular favorites. Which side plates they provide seems to vary there's always kimchi! , and unfortunately they're served per person rather than for the table, which cuts down on variety. Recently they've included a dessert of ginger persimmon soup, which is unique and a refreshing way to end the meal.",2
"Went in for a fill a couple of weeks after my full set and last review and not happy. Nails were all crooked and I have a terrible fill line in my pink which I've rarely had in the several years I've been having my nails done. Asked Ann to level out my tips and they are still crooked. Will not be returning, actually removed them and am on the search once again.",1
"get the slots out. nthey only take your money and leave you with a sour taste for Vegas. I had to hang out for 3 hours due to flight delay. Watched people playing slots for hours and not one person ever won. They only put money in, never seemed to take it out. would love to know the pay out on the airport slots as i'm sure it's very low.",1
We went there since it is near my new favorite deli NYBB and wont go back. Not many people in the place but it took 45 minutes for eggs and one of us got the wrong order. The female manager barely apologized and did not offer to do anything about it and since it was soooo late they got nothing.The bagels were horrible.,1
"This hotel is absolutely HORRIBLE.The hotel was dirty and not nice.I have nothing left to say,this is horrible.Now, I don't know if they renovated it yet, but this is based on 2006 2008.SUCKS!DON'T STAY HERE! PROS n Fridge in room For Free Use! n Panoramic Windows n Big Rooms 600 Sq Ft CONS n Dirty Rooms n Outdated n Not Nice n Off Strip n Smoky Casino",1
Your reservation means nothing. Almost 90 minutes past our reservation time we finally got seated. We were a party of FOUR! Inexcusably poor service throughout. This is the second bad experience in a row here. I gave it another shot on the advice of the rest of my party that lived their now closed location in Miami. There are plenty better places to eat in Vegas.,1
"Walking in you will not have high expectations. The outside of the building is very lacking. I usually give chinese food places a free pass for this one, but this one is speacial Approaching the host stand and attempting to communicate was not fun for take out! Ane the food was like something out of a grocery store hot deli line. poor poor poor",1
"Waited 15 minutes at hostess stand to be seated, no one showed. Sat ourselves at the bar amongst other guests, where a manager was stocking beer. No greeting from manager even. Wait another 10 minutes to see other guests looking around for service as well, but no showing of a bartender, server or even the previously seen manager. Sad showing from such high expectations.",1
Thee best place in town. I highly recommend this business. The young lady who works there was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the product. They replaced my iPhone 4s back cover at a very reasonable price. They also use genuine apple parts too. I was in and out of there in under 10 minutes!,2
"I love this quaint little European styled caf u00e9 close to the Mount Royal subway station. The unusual and high quality teas are lovely. The coffee is brewed to perfection, the food is hearty and delicious and the service is consistently attentive while still allowing its patrons long expanses of time to chat with friends, read, write and daydream thankfully without interruption.",2
We stopped by for lunch today and had a great lunch! We both got the bowl with various combinations and really enjoyed the fresh ingredients and being able to mix and match the sauces! It was nice to find a place with healthy options that didn't taste like something that everyone else has. The patio was nice and they accommodated our puppy! We can't wait to stop back by!,2
The chips and salsa are the best thing here that I have tried. Their tortillas are like the ones you buy at the store and their beans taste like Rosarita canned beans. This is probably a good place to go for drinks and appetizers but not so much for a meal. The staff was very friendly. Ill probably go back just for the convenience.,1
"Been seeing Alice for 2 years, first at ChaCha, now at Union. I refuse to get a hair cut by anyone else. She understands exactly what I want done with my hair every time, and delivers! She has talent when it comes to hair, and a great personality to boost! As for the salon, pleasant interior, welcoming atmosphere.",2
"In my opinion, Hana on 7th Ave. has the best sushi in town, but I just moved to Scottsdale and thought I'd try this highly rated place. Got violently ill a few hours after eating here. Besides that, the service was horrible, the fish was average, and the creativity of the sushi was poor. Never again!",1
I have tried a few doggie grooming places here in Vegas for my pomeranian and so far this is the best place. They cut my dog's hair exactly the way I asked for and the people are friendly there and the service was fast. The entire wash and cut cost 35 and it was definitely worth it! They have a lot of customers on Sat. so be sure to make an appointment.,2
"Three years later and I'm still in love. nIs it the best sushi? No. nBut for the price, flippin' awesome. nI can eat me some salmoigiri, and at this place, it's completely acceptable quality with an unbeatable price. We typically call for takeout, like, 2 times per week. nIf this place ever closes, I don't know what I'd do.",2
"So so pizza and pasta if you're too lazy to cook at home. Not bad but nothing spectacular. The buffet is very small and almost impossible for them to properly keep the pizza coming because people will horde nearly an entire pie once it's brought out. Go buy a whole one, you cows! It might just have the saddest salad bar I've ever seen. Your pal, nWalter",1
Totally take advantage of. Watch what they charge you or you will end up with 850 worth of charges for two people. No warning either and very disappointed with Caesars to allow this to happen. Would not recommend unless you have a thousand to blow for mediocre service and food. Would give zero stars but this website would not allow me to.,1
"Very slow service. I scheduled an appointment for 1 15, and arrived at 1 00 to give myself plenty of time. I was not seen until 2 15. What's the purpose of an appointment system if patients are taken in order whether they have appointments or are walk ins? I was forced to miss work and my boss was not happy! Thanks LabCorp!",1
"Five stars for the drink! I can't say much about the place itself it smelled like someone was smoking inside. I'm glad I found this spot, as it's an alternative to tea planet which is so hard to find parking for. I had the blended taro with honey boba. It was delicious! I'll be trying other drinks soon!",2
"Great restaurant but you may as, well skip the shuttle service. This year like last the driver was late. So late we had to bag. I even went to the effort to call the restaurant to confirm my reservation and the shuttle well before our time. Not sure I will be going back. On a positive note the drivers are consistent. Consistently late.",1
"Horrible service and overpriced! Girls that answer phones are rude and snotty! They keep sending me emails to come back in for a discount, I wouldn't go back even if it was free! Had a complaint for the owner and neither him or his ""wife "" who works there called back. Just because you have a billboard doesn't make your service better.",1
"What a fun theater to be at! My friends and I had a great time watching Zumanity. It was a funny, sexy, and interactive show. I loved how the cast interacts with their audience. This is the first show that I've ever watched in Vegas so I don't have much to compare to. It definitely is a show for the open minded because it is a show full of sexuality.",2
"One of the best burgers I've had in a long time. I got the Mexican Mouth Melter. It was quite spicy, but well balanced and delicious. And very messy, the way a burger like that should be! My wife got the Ranch Burger which was also very good. The service was fast and friendly as well. Oh, and they have a great kids' menu that's not too skimpy.",2
"Yet ANOTHER wonderful experience at Johnny's. CHEF ROD is THE BEST! nHeart of Italy CombinatioA combination of Chicken Parmigiano, Fettuccine nMinelli and Parmesan crusted top sirloin char broiled. EXCELLENT! My steak had a little gristle running thru the center and CHEF made me an ENTIRE replacement dinner to take home with me. THANK YOU CHEF!",2
Absolutely revoltingly disgusting attitude! Asked for table for four looking at at least 8 empty tables for more than four people. Instead of taking 2 chairs from a 6 top they told us there was a 20 min wait. When I referred to the empty tables she waved a paper in front of my face yelling she had many reservations. They will never see me again.,1
"This is one of my go to lunch places whenever I'm up on that side of town. Of course the falafel wrap is a favourite, but if you get a chance to try the one with the grilled vegetables. Fast service, fresh food, and plenty of tables to sit and watch the world go by what more could one want from a quick and sleazy shwarma experience?",2
"It's rare but even when I get salty I save money and time to eat a nice breakfast here. Eggs, sausages, wheat toast, hash browns with a pot of coffee in a stainless thermos on the table and fresh orange juice. nResturant is open to the conservatory place with all the flowers and the pool down below just out of earshot range. A peaceful and classy joint.roomy.",2
"The parking garage is an omen to the rest of the hotel casino bad. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the old school properties like Golden Nugget 4 Queens. They offer a classic old school Vegas feel and usually have excellent deals on food, entertainment. Alas, Hooters is basically like taking all the bad qualities of a downtown hotel and putting on the strip.",1
It was ok. Over priced for what I got. I got a regular spa pedicure 25 plus callous remover 5. I seriously did not get a massage I got lotion rubbed on my feet and legs. That's the best part of a pedicure is the massage so I was disappointed. Also the technician did not speak to me at all until the end when she wanted a tip. I guess everything's worth trying again but it was a waste of 30.,1
I understand that this is a laid back area but this is the slowest Starbucks I have ever been to in my life. We were behind two people and it took 15t minutes to get two lattes. We were in turn late for our meetings. There is absolutely no sense of urgency here. I will always avoid this Starbucks when in Scottsdale for Business from now on and tell everyone that works for me to do the same.,1
"Convenient, cheap, tasty and reasonable. For 24.99 you get a large pizza, wings, breadsticks and beverages. A slice will run you 5 7 and is actually two big slices. For 8 you get a slice and a beer full bottles of Heineken, etc . The place is a bit disorganized, but I can overlook that. Thin crust yumminess. Reminds me of Sbarro pizza.",2
"My husband will sometimes have me stop into Champion Motorsports to pick up parts he needs to fix one of our dirtbikes. I work nearby, so it's more convenient for me to do so then for him to do so. I never mind doing so because the staff is always so friendly and helpful. The prices are very fair and Eric, the owner, is very knowledgeable.",2
"I've only ever tried their delivery, seeing as my lunch break usually isn't at a convenient time to go try and make a store visit. The meals are decent, but a bit salt packed. Very large portions, but also very pricey. If you want a quick delivery for decent food, call them up. Otherwise, look elsewhere.",1
"Good sandwich! Spilt the new Yorkers with my husband it's so big! Fantastic baguette bread, blue cheese and caramelized onions. Yum. Side of macaroni salad hit the spot, didn't hv the typical macaroni after taste that I hate. So extra thumbs up for that. Sat on the patio and people watched, excellent lazy lunch. Now back to work ",2
"Islands Restaurant is quite a lovely restaurant. There is great value in the pre theater dinner menu with wine pairings and the only drawback is that the early meal is a bit rushed! So, if you want to dine, eat more slowly The service is absolutely perfect, with everyone right on target, friendly and professional! Excellent choice.",2
"Given my opinion of the Luxor hotel and casino, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at the steakhouse. Huge selection of steak, including both Japanese and American Kobe, along with a solid selection of wine and beer to complement the meal. Staff were very friendly and didn't keep us waiting around too long for our meal.",2
"Reached out to Choice hotels months ago about my complaint Choice hotels owns the econolodge franchise and Still have not had a responce on the awful stay at this hotel! It is dangerous, please do not stay here! So Dangerous and it is clear they have NO regard for your safety, no standards at all and the owner doesnt care one bit.",1
Don't waste time or money here but walk or drive 100 feet away to Wok Wei. We had hot and sour soup at both places and Wok Wei's had big shrimps in it and better taste. Yans was not even hot and tasted like hint of BBQ sauce. the egg rice seemed to be devoid of egg and the Mongolian beef was mostly onion. Most of my meal got tossed in the trash. Very disappointing,1
Following my YELP comments I was contacted by AAA. They aggressively analyzed my concerns and told me their courses of action that would be applied to solving the problems. For this I appreciate their efforts and believe that the proactive attitude they have presented means that the organization will improve.,2
"Great location, great restaurants, Best Buy and TRADER JOE'S what a combination but the drawback is the traffic. Complex management doesn't seem to be active in making it better instead the cars back up, creating a real mess. Hope the benefits and popularity of this place don't become its downfall. The place needs a good traffic engineer.",2
We were here for a family gathering. They set us up in a nice room. The chips were good but the salsa was very bland and watery. I got the a chimi which is a signature dish. The beef was ok but really didn't care for the cheese sauce. The rest of my family said their food was just ok. I really expected it to be better.,1
"Hate it when a place gets greedy. This was one of my favorite spots, however they changed the menu, again, which I understand is necessary in the first years, but literally doubling the price of your meals is outrageous. The food is great, and was previously reasonably priced still enough to open a second location! , but I guess they wanted more. Bring back the BBQ program and get over yourselves.",1
This cafe was suggested by the concierge of our hotel. My husband and I decided to eat breakfast here the first morning we were in Montreal. The coffee was very good as was the food. We shared an omelette and a bagel with cream cheese. The overall space was small but it was not busy when we went on a Sunday morning.,2
"After tried a few other pleases close to me , I won't name names , and this is by far the best. I went here on a Tuesday evening as walk in . The place seems to very busy but the waiting was around 15mins . The shop is cute and very clean . The staff do such good work and very friendly , you can tell they really care about the quality that walk out the door . I am happy with the service and price.",2
"Great place for a quick lunch or non dressy dinner. Fast service, fair prices and tasty food. Not authentic Chinese or Italian food by any means. Think fast food for noodle dishes. nThe outside seating is very nice when the weather allows and comes with the added entertainment of watching people sit in the chikfila drivethrough for up to 45 minutes during lunch.",2
"Overall I was unimpressed with this place. I've ordered delivery from here a few times. Delivery times were slow and the food was very greasy. If you're in a pinch, I'd say go for it, but there are other places out there. I definitely wouldn't go here to sit down and eat considering there are far superior sit down italian places nearby.",1
Best prices you will find! They staff is super fantastic and always willing to answer any questions you have! I come here weekly for quest bars. 1.99 each and my favorites are cinnamon roll and apple pie. I also get dymatize elite vanilla in the 5lbs bottle monthly. They hand samples out at lvac pretty often so you can always try something out before you purchase!,2
"1998 Jeep Grand Laredo Cherokee they've been monitoring rotation, fixing punctures my tires since 2007 2005 Toyota Matrix they've been monitoring these now, since just this past fall, 2013. Excellent service to date, and always a busy store with highly efficient staff zipping around and treating each customer as an important client.",2
"I saw this place and thought it looked great, so I went in on a whim and asked if anyone was available for a haircut. Luckily for me, Sophia was available. She gave me a great haircut exactly what I asked for. And I really enjoyed talking to her too! This is a great salon and I highly recommend Sophia for all your styling needs!",2
This was my restaurant of choice when I lived in Phoenix. I came here for 4 birthdays in a row. My birthdays that is. Service is always spectacular. Its been said before but the chorizo stuffed dates are not to be missed. The only downside is over ordering and walking out of here in a comfort food coma.,2
"The service was absolutely horrible. We waited over an hour for our food. Maybe they need more help in the kitchen because we were not the only customers that thought about leaving. Several actually did walk out. I have no idea what was taking them so long. The food was not even worth an hour wait. A cannoli at Carlos bakery in Hoboken is, but a burger at this hole in the wall is not.",1
"Does exactly what it says on the tin, St Mary's is a Post Office in the very purest sense. No sweets, no ice lollies, no gifts. Just a few postcards, envelopes and stamps. All wrapped up in wonderfully efficient service. Excellent, until the thieving postman gets his grubby little nicotine stained hands on it.",2
"Were super helpful, friendly, and fixed the alignment on my car quickly while I waiting with a scheduled appt, I was not a walk in . This is a family run type place, and it was nice to see the names of everyone on that wall that worked there, accompanied by their photo and how many years they had worked there.",2
"Haben dort nach einer kleinen Rundreise den letzten Abend hier verbracht, nach vielem einheimischem Essen war es uns nach einem Italiner und der hier, kann mit den Besten auf dem Kontinent jederzeit mithalten. Klasse Pizza und Nudeln, sowie tolle Weine, dass hat aber seinen Preis. Das Ampiente ist sehr sch u00f6n, das Restaurant ist Perfekt eingerichtet, dass Personal einfach Spitze !",2
"I don't know if Olive Garden went down down down in food quality or if it's always just been bad. Haha In high school we used to always eat at Olive Garden and it was so delicious! My most recent visit the service was not good, Zoupa Toscana was too salty, salad looked old and my ravioli was nothing special . Hmmm sorry OG even your unlimited soup breadsticks can't save you ",1
"Was in town for a conference.I ordered online, my order was screwed up 2 days in a row The 1st night they completely forgot my brown rice. The 2nd night the green beans were burned beyond recognition.What's a girl to do.at home Chicago , I've never had a bad experience with PFC's.Oh well, u can't win 'em all ",1
I live in summerlin so this place is a little out of the way but way worth the trip. The pablano stuffed with shrimp is so damn good! I wanted to take a whole other one home to eat later. The salsa's here are authentic and have just the right kick. Gustavo is an absolute gentleman and makes you feel like you are eating at his home.,2
"Honestly the best carpet cleaning job I've ever had! Rick is so polite and efficient, he did our entire upstairs, on time, did such an amazing job! He got big stains out that we couldn't and helped us get our money back for our deposit on a rental, no worries at all!.if you need any services go to Carpet Monkeys! You won't regret it.",2
"Orient Express is a perfect place to go when you're hungry and in a rush. Just like everyone else says food is always out within 15 minutes. The strawberry bubble tea is awesome, and so is the chow fun. I've never had a bad meal here, and I've eaten here A LOT, seeing as they were so close to my school. They're usually pretty nice about splitting up checks, which is good.",2
"I was not impressed with this hotel at all. Very tiny rooms, no fridge, service is bad and slow. We stood here for Labor Day weekend 2014. It took an hour just to bring up our luggage, ice and towels. Not to mention it has one small window facing the parking lot and a back street. I will not be staying here again with my girlfriends.",1
Been here several times and the service was great. Even offered to drive me to a place for lunch while I waited. nFeeling a change now and it's not good. nTelling me I need services into the hundreds of dollars I know I don't need. Do they really think women are stupid? Mentioned asking my guy and they didn't push it. nTrust is gone. I won't be back.,1
"Stopped by for a quick bite at lunchtime. The buffet has a variety of delicious food. My favorites were the aloo gobi and the samosas. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. A very enjoyable experience. nBTW, by noon this place was filled to capacity! And on the way out of the restaurant, there was a guy from the restaurant playing on a drum to ""drum up "" business!",2
"Old, smelly, dark. this is totally what I expected when I got here. I heard that they had amazing prime rib but when my ""rare "" slab came to the table, it was definitely ""well done "" with no pink whatsoever. It was bland and dry. The prices are cheap and the portions are large but I would never go out of my way to eat here again.",1
"Another Perfect meal at Del Frisco's! Got a table for 2 right away by booking on Open Table, Perfect Filet Mignon and Crab Cake and Scallops were excellent also! Sides just as good and the Del Salad with Avocado dressing is my favorite salad anywhere! Didn't have room for dessert but the Lemon 7 layer cake is a must!",2
"mmmmmmmm! Yum o! nGluten Free Vegan goodness, BOMB! I was incredibly happy with the food and the service! The curry hummus was deliciously unique and the GF pasta was fabu! nHOWEVER, the seating seats are no bueno hence the single star deduction! Not the most comfy for my rump. But I'll definitely go back! Great vibe, rock on downtown!",2
"I had shopped for business insurance to get the best rate and coverage for quite a while and settled on, what I thought was a fair price. Then I met Steve from Cook Insurance. He showed me how I could have the same coverage for far less than what I was paying. I am so grateful to Steve for saving me over 30 on my premiums. I would recommend him to anyone! Brenda Tucker, Center Stage Interiors",2
False Advertisement hours of operation are false. My boyfriend I went in one night around 1 am we got the AYCE within half an hour they said last call! Wth your bright lights outside said til 4 am! The food was 'alright as we were finishing up the waitress asked for the tip! Really!? Who does that!?,1
As I get off of the elevator there is a sign that states 3 beer and shot all night and 3 well and all beers until 10 pm. Go to the bar and try to order and the bartender says we only have B1G1. They don't even offer what they advertise. Drinks aren't even good and you can get anything B1G1. nGreat view but find somewhere else.,1
"We have made it a point to come to this restaurant when we are in town. This was our first visit since the new mgmt has taken over.the service was adequate, drinks expensive and the food prices priced out of the market. This was the most expensive steak my husband has ever eaten. We and the friends who live here locally, will not be returning.",1
I have come here 2 different times and they have tried to jam both of my groups into a smaller amount of tables. 1 more table would be great. First time it was a group of 15 adults and the 2nd time it was 6 adults and 1 high chair. We tried calling ahead to give them warning both times and they dont take reservations. The wait wasnt to bad either time. Food is amazing.,1
Half of the machines are broken but don't have an out of order sign so you put coins in and lose them. We lost at least 20 coins because of this. Most of the games don't tell you how many coins they take. Way under staffed. Bathrooms are gross. Whole place is dirty and run down. Definitely won't return.,1
"Its Danny so we can expect much. My 7 year old daughter keeps seeing the commercial on Disney so she wanted to try it. When we left she said ""we dont need to go back there again! We tried it and it's not our cup of tea "" her pizza was cold and no flavor. So she tried pancakes and said that they were okay",1
"Convenient for UNLV Students. The lunch special is the way to go. 6.95 and you get soup, and spring roll and the entree with rice. The place has been recently remolded and the food is much better than before. Not the best . but it hits the spot. Best thing on the Menu is the curry and the orange chicken. Staff is very friendly.",1
"This is an awesome deal, you can eat at 6 different casinos on the strip! Everything was great, we got it about 1 in the afternoon and had lunch, dinner and breakfast then lunch as our last meal. GREAT DEAL! We actually met people that were on a mission to eat at all 6 locations before their 24 hours were up. Fight on!",2
"Roast beef was amazing that sandwich alone will bring me back again before I leave Vegas. I didn't care for the pizza I've had better. But that sandwich was easily one of the best I've had. I ordered a pizza, chips and drink and the roast beef sandwich for about 20. The veggie sandwich is around 8 is also great. And the BLT is good as well.",2
"This was my very first time experiencing a spray tan right before my trip to Hawaii. Ann is amazing, very professional! Super throughout when she explained the care I should take for the best results after my ""tanning "" session. Super cute shop, clean, and great location. A big thank you to Ann! Phoenix Glow is awesome!",2
"I ordered 2 things when I got to the window young Anna recited only one item to me to confirm my order, I corrected her, and her dead eyes locked with mine and said ""oh. "" Awkward pause ""yeah "". In short, I hope she was just really stoned because if not she possessed the personality of a tube sock. Food was good.",1
"We started with the BBQ Shrimp appetizer which is excellent, it's the reason we returned. My lunch entree was great, a moist half chicken with ham mashed potatoes. absolutely delicious. My wife wasn't all that impressed with the steak sandwich which was served cold and the meat was rare rather than medium as described.",2
"No replayability, terrible signage, lack of hole diversity. I meao Pars are listed and the holes all have a different difficulty. However, the difficulty is only present in a first play through. Once you play a hole you learn it's secret. Half of the holes are basically the same gimick anyways. To top it all off there is no Windmill. Worth the one time.",1
"One of my favorite, relaxed and trendy cocktail bars in PHX. You must get the White Rabbit Cocktail, it's amazing. There is some good people watching, and it's great for conversation with friends. It's a small bar, so don't expect to find someplace to sit, even though there is plenty of seating, it's always a comfortable level of full. ",2
"If I could give zero stars I would. I will NEVER rent from thrifty again or let anyone I know rent from then. I have rented dozens of cars from other car rental places and never had an issue. I made a reservation weeks in advance, got to the place and had all sorts of complications. The employees were VERY rude and not accommodating. DO NOT RENT FROM THRIFTY!",1
"I've been banking with BOFA for over five years now, and the branch on Silverado Ranch and Bermuda has been one of my ""go to "" branches close to home. I love how the 24 hour ATM service has the cash deposits built in. This is a great convenience for tipped employees being we carry so much cash to the bank all the time.",2
"Dr. Bonsteel is fantastic! My husband, who hates the dentist, had to get extensive work done to fix what the military did to his teeth. Dr. Bonsteel made all of it happen with minimal agony for my husband and our pocketbook. nThey're conveniently located on Forbes and Shady, above the Dunkin' Donuts, and they take UPMC dental insurance.",2
"Should change name to ""Ah Ful. "" Seriously, the worst food I've ever had in Las Vegas.and I've been to Vegas, A LOT. Wannabe PF Chang decor, horrible service. The food tasted and smelled so bad. It smelled like rotten fish. Our entire party of five honestly had to laugh at it it was THAT bad. I will NEVER go here again. They have 1.5 star ranking on Yelp how on earth are they still in business?",1
My husband and I were on a 10 day business trip and we ate here twice. We've eaten many places in Vegas and Emeril's service is second to none! The wait staff and managers are excellent as well as the food . Try the Gluten free chocolate cake and the banana cream pie was to die for! A must try in Vegas!,2
"Do not be fooled by the full parking lot! If it was great the lengthy line would be worth it. The BBQ sauce had no taste and we had the brisket and pulled pork and after a few bites we swore we would never come back! Highly disappointed cuz there are not a lot of BBQ places in the area so we were so excited. Oh well, we will just keep hoping for a new place to open.",1
"If you think you've arrived at a warehouse and might get mugged in the parking lot, you know you're about to have an amazing meal. The food is authentic, the flavors are delicious. Everything I've tried is fresh and tasty. Eggplant, gai lan, fried fish, fish soup, green beans, scallion pancakes, vegetable lo mean, mapo tofu. All delicious. And they deliver!",2
"There's absolutely no reason to eat here unless it's the only place that's open.and even then you may want to rethink your options. Service by the wait staff was fine.friendly and fairly attentive.service from the kitchen was quite slow.More importantly, the food was just plain 'blah'. And at 20 a head for breakfast it should be a lot better than 'blah'.",1
"Staff was nice however food quality very poor. My meal was a ribeye steak, half of it was fat and the veggies were bland. My boyfriend got the prime rib it was completely raw on the inside, pretty sure it was still mooing. First and last time I will ever go there. Would also give a zero if possible.",1
"Our waitress, Jazmin, was fabulous. She made some great suggestions after listening carefully to us about what we liked. We had the fire naan, lamb rogan josh, and the vegetable korma. Let's just say that we stuffed ourselves with fantastic tasting food. If you are wondering where this restaurant is, you will find it in the Rio casino area.",2
The best soul food in Arizona. My only gripe is with the desserts. The banana pudding at this location is never fresh. Banana pudding made in large quantities is good for 24 hours. The vanilla wafers should not be soggy and the bananas should not be black. ijs. Conversely this location has infinitely better service than central and central has better dessert than Scottsdale. You do the math.,2
"I have always been a big fan. A frequent patron for 10 years. This weekend my father and I went for lunch the Carne Adovada was very good, however the Pozole was cool and fatty. And the Tesuque salad was lacking dressing, and the chicken was bland. Could be a hit if better prepared. I will visit again.",1
"Was craving sesame chicken and found this place nearby. Took a gamble and was impressed not only by the quality and taste of the food but also the lunch price and portion size. It was a great deal and service was awesome. Highly recommend if you are looking for a place to try for lunch that offers meals w soup, egg roll, and won ton included at under 8 bucks.",2
Customer service is a joke.someone gave me the wrong appointment time and instead of apologizing and figuring out who was answering phones at the time they made it seem like i was lying and just they were plain out rude.if you expect people to pay your prices for pictures that look like Walgreens printed them out I highly suggest treating customers better,1
"I have never, I meaever NOT tipped. until I went to Spazzi Nails. Went for a pedicure and the paint job looked like a 5 year old did it. I pointed out I had nail polish overflowing from my toenails onto my cuticles and skin and they looked at me like I was nuts. What happened to the customer is always right? Princess Nails across the street in the Walgreens center is MUCH better.",1
"Wide array of herbs and ointments. To see the doctor, it is 10 then anything he prescribes is extra. Tell the lady at the counter what ails you and then she will ask some questions and tell you to wait in the seating area for the doctor. There are plenty of prepackaged teas and herbs. The service was friendly enough and is a good idea if you like to pursue other Eastern medicine solutions.",2
"LIPSTICK ON A PIG. nThis is a renovated Hampton Inn and it shows it on every level. I have stayed at many Indigo properties and I'm shocked IHG Hotel Group would call this it's own. nJust like other reviews, the walls are thin with wallpaper pealing. Very little closet space and cheap damaged furniture. nAlso, beware. This is a party hotel. I stayed three nights and slept maybe 10 hours total.",1
The food is always good at Lucille's. The servers at this location are pretty young so they spent a lot of time conversing and not attending to their tables. I kept having to flag down our waiter when I needed anything. Don't expect to get a buzz or even taste the alcohol in the 22oz flavored drinks.,1
"The wait staff were amateurs, I hate having too ask for refills anything add'l. Our yamakake bowl should come with shoyu but we had to ask for it, we had to ask for small plates to share the dishes, quite frustrating. The food was very bland needed more flavor. The portions did not fit the prices. I'll be willing to give them another chance but I'll wait a while so they get more experience.",1
"Poblano. Chicken. Enchiladas. Incredible! Sauce was amazing. Roasted chiles mixed with heavy cream. Get me a straw! nGuacamole was very good. nOur server seemed to have a bit of amnesia going on. Water stayed empty after the initial fill, salsa as well. nThis place is one the high side of average price, but it is convenient to the convention center and seating serving was fairly quick.",2
"This is a decent place. Ordered a mini shake and fries with fry sauce use the yelp check in offer for free fries! . The fry oil needed to be changed. The shake was delicious the mini was very large oh, the irony . Bathrooms weren't the cleanest, staff wasn't the friendliest. The shake was so yummy, though, that Iceberg gets four stars from me!",2
"I was not expecting this to be as good as it was, and so I went twice while I was in Pittsburgh for three days. The wine list is terrific, as you might expect. The food was interesting and yummy. The bartenders and servers were friendly, which is not always the case when you're a solo diner. I will visit here whenever I'm in town.",2
"Sushi was alright. Wasn't the best but it was decent. The pricing was not too bad but not too great either. The atmosphere was nice and cute. Though, the service was just ok. They aren't really personable. They were more like hi what u want , ok here you go, ok bye. lol. But overall it is okay and I would go back again.",2
"Great customer service, and the food was very good. We had burgers, salad, fries and onion rings. Our order was mistakenly given to someone else, and the staff quickly fessed up. Our order was brought out by the manager with an apology. The tavern picked up our whole lunch tab. Mistakes happen, and when we are treated this way it makes us just want to come back the next time!",2
"Came here with a party of five close to closing time. The staff were very friendly and didn't seem too put out when we stayed a bit past closing. The food was all very good, especially the Green Curry. We all managed to scrape the plates clean and the bill for the five of us was 100 before our wondrous Groupon, which took off 40. The neighborhood was kinda shady looking though.",2
"It's cool to see, got a 5 off coupon so 30 per ticket. This is a rip off. Max value is 20 a ticket. Audio tour is worthless, you can get it for free checking in on yelp we put it away after the 2nd exhibit. Not worth coming here from another hotel. We stayed at Aria and walking into Luxor is horrific. Place is a dump. Stop staring at the dudes dinguses on the tour too, you Mississippi freak shows!",1
"Came here for the first time and LOVED it! My husband has never liked Thai before. Gaati changed all that! FINALLY I can enjoy Thai on a regular basis with my family! We had Pad Thai Noodles, Cashew Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Pineapple Chicken. Everything was great! Thank you Gaati! We will be back soon!",2
Visited again today at lunch time. I should have known we would have crappy service when we were greeted at the door by a sign saying to seat ourselves as no hostess was on duty. Sorry for the inconvenience. I think there were only 2 servers working TOTAL. Horrible service and the flour tortillas were not fresh. They were very dry. I think this the last strike.,1
This place has exceptional food and pretty great service for how busy it always is. nI like it because there are quite a few vegetarian options. Before I started my vegetarian kick the Baked wings were some of the best wings I have had anywhere. Try n Mushroom Party Pizza n Roasted Corn Pizza n Baked Wings n Red Velvet Cake Only con is the parking is kinda crazy.,2
For my wife and I the bill usually comes to 30 dollars or so before tip. This allows for leftovers to take to work for lunch. Always pleased. They usually deliver much faster than quoted time but we are also only 1 mile away. Have not oredered anything we did not like. Delivery guy is nice but they are not too welcoming when you go in for pickup.,2
"I'm new to coffee, so I'm the first to admit that my opinion might be off. That said, the Latte I had at Arefa's this morning was one of the worst I've had in a while. I could barely taste the coffee. Maybe it was an off day or an off cup, but I was pretty disappointed. That said, some of the positive reviews here suggest that I should give it another try. Will report back when I do.",1
Good little spot if you dont feel like boiling up your own seafoods. it is what it is really can say much. the food is fresh reasonably priced and it has options. The staffing could use a little more help with promptness as well as friendliness. I think most of them are there just to make some cash but it should also be about the customer too!,2
"I hardly ever feel like I waste money when eating out, but this place is an exception. They were good but my experience today solidifies my belief that this is a glorified truck stop gone chain. Our food wa greasy, undercooked and the toast something a five year old can do right was burnt. I ate quietly and left because it wasn't worth the energy to complain. Needless to say, I shan't return.",1
Had takeout from Thai Rama CHandler this past weekend. nTheir Chicken Panang is delicious. And gluten free! nAs is their Pad Thai! I was tickled to get yummy gluten free food from a restaurant. I've had food from here multiple times. It's always good! And the gentleman who helped me and my 20 questions about what is gluten free and what's not was very patient and helpful.,2
"Absolute rubbish and RUDE service by the day time waitress. Greasy fries that were ""hand cut "" and very slow service resulted in a nearly 2hr lunch that left none of us satisfied. Don't waste your time, the Tilted Kilt is in the same parking lot and offers far better food I can't believe I said that and far friendlier service.",1
"If it is all about the food for you, then this is a great place. Nice variety of dishes, well seasoned, cooked to perfection. My top choice in LV for going out with friends without having them blanch at the final bill. Service is generally good, but not consistent. Not a fan of the location or the decor, but the great food makes up for these relatively minor negatives.",2
"Disappointed. Getting our meals after ordering took too long and the last of seven meals came 8 minutes after the rest. nI had the calamari marinara, the sauce was NOT homemade and fresh. It was served on linguini NOT the angel hair pasta I requested. The person ordering the pizza said it was only average. The Caesar salad I had was only OK. We would not return here.",1
"I've only been here for late night bowling with young cousins in law, but it has always been a fun experience. My only real complaint is the parking situation. Orleans has a huge parking lot all around it, and yet it's always full. I don't know how this is the case as the inside never seems THAT busy, and yet visit after visit I find myself circling around and around trying to find an open space.",2
I just went dress shopping here with my MOH and we were both disappointed. The shop seemed dirty and the dresses were dirty makeup oil from brides trying them on . The dresses were all kept in bags and the salesperson put the dresses in the dressing room and left me to take them out of the bags! I could only find 3 dresses that I was remotely interested in trying on.,1
"This is the local Circle K in my neighborhood. It is on the way for the one stop shop. They have good coffee, Power Ball, RedBox, and even Propane for the BBQ. I usually get gas at Costoc, so Circle K is a good backup. It is clean inside, easy to maneuver on the outside, and the employees are polite and friendly.",2
"The concierge at the hotel recommended this restaurant, so on faith we accepted her suggestion and we are very glad we did! Such a cute place, with a great wine list, excellent ambiance, and the food was delicious. The fish chips were some of the best I've ever had lightly battered and with rosemary instead of dill in the tartar sauce. So good! Highly recommended.",2
I went once before.it was cold and guess what I guess they don't know what fire is. Because the eggs was served to me cold yet again. And I got up and walked out. I wont pay for bad service nor will I pay for cold food. Don't go to this location. EVER.and if you do remember I told you the eggs would be stone cold ,1
"Ate here on 4 5. Came over from shopping in Scottsdale and arrived early 6pm without reservation. Were seated in the large outdoor patio. Offered both the dinner menu and the happy hour menu, which had limited selections. Ordered off both. Found both the service and food to be excellent. Had several glasses of an Italian red that was on the happy hour menu very reasonably priced and quite good.",2
Less than a 1 what a crappy place. Went on Sat Nite around 2am and not enough help so I can't blame the waitress but seriously I was set at a dirty table and basically stacked the dirty dishes myslef and almost shoved them to the floor after 30 mins. Agaiot our waitress fault but horrible service and the food is not worth the wait . You have been warned .,1
This store is a disgrace. No matter what time of day you go there is always only ever one lane open. Also the store is dirty and I mean dirty I wore a pair of long black pants to this Walmart and by the time I left the store the bottom of my pants were covered and dust. I am talking at least 3 inches up the leg.,1
"Very delicious food! I had Red Chili burro, great flavor! My partner had Chicken Enchilada Plate and the plate was a clean slate when he was done. My sister had Chili Rellano Special and Carne Asada Tacos, the rellano was great with flavor. The chips come with beans drizzled over them and crumbled cheese and the red sauce is great! It was Mother's Day around 3pm, we were able to sit immediately.",2
"The best thing about being trapped working in a dark, reality TV, control room is that LEE's Sandwiches is ONE BLOCK AWAY! The 5 Pork Sandwich has always been a classic for me. Having been to college in the OC CA , one of the few places that's open and crowded at 200am is LEE's! The smell of fresh Baguette's is devine.",2
"This place used to be a mattress factory and now it presents several floors of modern art. I have to say it wasn't as impressive as the Andy Warhol Museum and the place kind of creeped me out. Each floor starts out as a blank canvas and you have to follow a dark maze to reach the artwork. One of the neatest exhibitions is from Yayoi Kusama, she has a serious obsession with dots.",2
"Somewhere between Denny's and the Cheesecake Factory, with huge, greasy portions, and every cuisine under the sun being represented at it's absolute blandest. The menu is 12 pages long, single spaced size 10 font. It's just a mess. BBQ, Thai, Italian, Nachos. But everything is so boring. The food is food. But it is a total waste of a meal.",1
"Can we just pretend that the one star is in fact a quarter of a star? Their automated system sucks! And they have no sense of customer service! They sent a cab meant for Tempe all the way seven miles down through Mesa, and it took them well over an hour to correct the problem, with no apologies, no reparations, no satisfaction what so ever!",1
Food and service good but VERY pricey especially for lunch. A simple cheese quesadilla was 7.50 and to top it a small scoop of sour cream in a little taco shell was an additional 2.50! Probably wont go there again too expensive when you can go to others for much larger portions and free side of sour cream.,1
"I visited some friends in Charlotte over Memorial day weekend. We were taken on a ""tour "" of the city, D D was on that list. The service was excellent, the staff is knowledgeable about the various products and is more than willing to spend time and answer questions. When I go back, I will be back to Dean and Deluca.",2
We were recommended by a family friend customer services was great the only down fall is we had applied for a consolidation they told us they would get back to us in one day yet it has been over a week we call and to check the status of our loan and they tell us they will return the call back and we never get a call back from them. Never again doing business with this branch!,1
One of the top endocrinologist I have ever met. A Dr. who really cares about each and everyone of his patients! He loves what he does and it shows in his devotion to each and every patient. Dr. B as his patients call him is an awesome compassionate Doctor. Without a doubt the best Endocrinologist Dr. in Las Vegas! Keep up the awesome work Dr. B!,2
"Pizza erstaunlich lecker, auch wenn sie danach nicht aussah sehr sp u00e4rlich belegt . Der Salat war eine Frechheit 10 Euro f u00fcr einen Salat mit Putenbrust die war halb so gro u00df wie mein Handy , der anderswo als Beilagensalat serviert wird. Die Bedienungen waren u00fcberfordert, als es voller wurde. Wir haben ewig auf die Getr u00e4nke gewartet ",1
saturday at 2 30 pm pre costco visit nsurprisingly attractive inside but food was bland and lukewarm at best I kept flashing back to Restaurant Impossible rants about food temps. nalthough plate removal and refills were prompt was disapointed in everything else! I won't be back sorry. save your money and eat at home!,1
"DELICIOUS! I have been to nearly every Thai restaurant in the valley, and spent a month in Bangkok. The food is far better than the name trust me. I recommend the Tom Ka Gai, Panang Curry, and Pad Thai! Everything is freshly prepared, the restaurant is very clean and aesthetically pleasing, and the staff is excellent. Highly recommend.",2
FABULOSO! This was wonderful pizza. When I went for the first time I have been many times now the owner introduced himself and gave me some garlic knots on the house DELICIOUS! The marinara sauce that came with them was amazing as well. something you don't usually find in a smaller pizza place. Try the sausage pizza ,2
"Amazing prices outstanding customer service. Don't let the little storefront in a sort of ghetto strip mall fool you. Superior quality on lenses, also. Renee helped me and is fantastic. I came here after being told my buy one get one deal at Visionworks would cost me over 600. Walked out of here with FOUR pairs for less than that. Awesome.",2
"Small, easily accessible, clean, and all around fantastic. Reminded me of my all time fave airport in the OC, John Wayne without the LA traffic. No drama from arrival to the baggage check, rental center, check in and security. Convenience and comfort are the 2 descriptors that are top of mind when thinking about my experience there, which isn't the regular in most airports. Luv it!",2
Overall I was unsatisfied. The service wasn't anything to write home about. The food was incredibly bland. It didn't help that one of my dinning partners claimed it to be the best mexican food restaurant she has ever been to. Yeah maybe just a little too much hype going on. Take a pass on this place there are so many better choices in Vegas.,1
"This place is nice, except when it's a weekend night. It is way too crowded in there. The line didn't take too long to get in, but it feels like they honestly let way too many people inside. That makes the experience worse. Getting pushed around, having no personal space at all. When trying to navigate over to the bar and back to your friends, that's a long process.",1
i freaking love this place. they have plenty of samples. and plenty of maple stuff. my fiancee and i shared a maple ice cream as well as a couple cookies. we also bought a box of maple chunks since that's something we could carry on the plane. i also had a cappuccino which was sprinkled with maple sugar overall. this is a tourist place but you got to check it out,2
"Oh my. I just had a joygasm while scarfing down chicken ramen. That plate of food was seriously tasty, enough for two people and less than a fiver. Amazing! This is a cheap and cheerful place. No airs and graces. Tables are packed in, it's really busy and noisy and waiting staff are brisk. And yeah, there's the ridiculous chopstick thing. Worth it for the scran I just ate though. Will be back.",2
"Wish I could give 0 stars. I reached at 7 45 pm and the lady at the counter rudely said they are closed, even though the sign outside said Open and closing time is stated as 8pm. Terrible attitude, indifferent callous, clueless about why people go to facilities like fast med. I had tried to get appointment through their site prior to the visit, but it was broken.",1
"This place is frickin awesome! I could write a whole page on this, but I love the atmosphere and I love the food and the prices are pretty good, but the vibe and atmosphere is the best. The staff is second to none, unbelievable. This place must breed great employees at all of their restaurants. I look forward to going back many times.",2
"The veggie burger is delicious! The fries were average. The staff were friendly. We liked the ambiance for the most part, but wish it wasn't so smokey. Big flat screens on walls and large booths to sit in. Nice and comfortable place for near by locals. We'll definitely be back for more veggie burgers! Above average food.",2
"My boyfriend, who introduced me to Vietnamese food, brought me here for the first time about 4 months ago. It is not convenient to where we live, but it is worth the drive. I order the 39 and he gets the 4. The owner knows what we both order and its always delivered quickly. Their Thai Iced Tea is amazing.",2
"I think the hype here is focused on local tradition, not necessarily the food or service. The sandwich wasn't bad, but I wasn't overly impressed by any part of the meal. I think I would have enjoyed it more with the fries and slaw on the side. It's also pretty annoying that the bill they place on the table doesn't have any sort of item pricing or total. Makes it difficult to split, too!",1
We are there every visit to Vegas. Ask for Sylvia's station. she is the best! Now the food. You better be really hungry and bring lots of friends. The Woody Allen is enough to feed a family of 4. This sandwich at 20. is worth ordering just to look and marvel at it. it's like the 7th wonder of the restaurant world. Watch some of the other sandwiches walk by and you will be amazed.,2
"From the outside this place looks amazing, but looks were very decieving. We went to eat the highly talked about sushi, and didnt eat anything else but sushi. The sushi was less than ok. It tasted like sushi you would get from vons or some sort of supermarket. I was not satisfied with it at all. Not sure how the regular dining is but I would not recomend eating the sushi.",1
"I was a dinosaur with an original ipad for kids movies with a majorly cracked screen.they helped me here to troubleshoot my issue and walk away for less then a screen repair to purchase a reconstructed og ipad that had twice the memory and serves my needs well, thank you! I appreciate that they n gave me several options to choose from ",2
I wish would have read these reviews before I went there. They replaced my battery and it died after 3 days. Couldn't t find a manager. The battery was defected. No apology. they didn't care and were upset because they had to replace it. Hope they don't put it back on the self for the next sucker to buy it!,1
"They put up a bogus Groupon that brought them in a lot of business. The Groupon ad was a sham, and I was refunded my money as a result. They claimed to give 244 in store value for 45, but when you get there it's really only about 50 in value. They have no defense to it either, and all but admit it's just bringing in business for their lower level beds.",1
"The best Korean Mexican fusion in town! nI've reviewed Komex so many times, and almost every time they've delivered a high quality product at an incredibly affordable price and the taste has always been consistently delicious. This is their newest location and features one of the owner's as the featured chef.",2
"Very helpful stuff, but you can't leave only two employees to work by themselves in a busy day.really, what is the management thinking? This is not a way to save money for the company. nI had to watt for over 30 minutes just to have my phone insurance canceled, since you can't do it online anymore.at least two clients left while I was waiting, because of the long wait.",1
"One of the best buffets in Vegas , hands down. Having tried several different buffets I can honestly say you can tell the difference in the quality you get at Bayside. There is a decent selection of different items. but again I believe it is about quality not quanitity We will def. return on our next trip !",2
"Limited menu, but good cheap eats with most dishes 6 or less. Curry chicken was a large portion of tender chunks of chicken and potatoes in a delicious curry sauce with a bit of heat. Came with white rice n Food came out quickly. Probably waited less than 10 minutes. n Wasn't busy when I stopped by around noon on a Monday. n Clean interior",2
"We used to come here to read, study and write. I am a supporter of a local business so I will try to choose this kind of place as opposed to other chains. nThey have a very refreshing ice tea with a reasonable price and their mocha meets my standard. nI love the atmosphere too not too quiet but not noisy. The barista is always nice on every visit I make.",2
"Still one of my favorites for steaks in Las Vegas. Though the menu is on the pricier side, they have some of the best steaks you will find in Vegas. Their kobe beef cuts are excellent and their filet mignon is always tender. If you are eating with a group of people who are really hungy their kobe beef tasting menu is a great value and worth the experience.",2
"Location of the store is great! Camelback and 44th street is very convenient. Its great store if you are an old grandmother or if you are looking for a present for grandmother! n I'm European woman, who used to high quality clothes, what you definitely will not find in this store. You also will not be able return your item for cash, only for store credit. nVery disappointed!",1
"Service! Where us the service! I have been here for 15 minutes without so much as a glass of water. You shouldn't tell people ""oh just sit anywhere "" and forget about them. It doesn't matter how your food taste if no one ever gets to order. I just watch three customers walk out and I'm right behind them.",1
"Hit this place on our pub crawl. Forgive me but I spoke to some people who say this place is crazy after 11 pm. Like wall to wall partiers. It is on a hot corner on Whiskey Row. But we were early and one of three people inside, pretty much ignored by the bartender who was setting up. We didn't stay long and moved on. More to see.",1
"I stopped by on NYE. The place looked clean, but I didn't stay very long. They had several flavors and I chose Red Velvet and Salted Caramel. Mmmmmmkay, dat's tasty! Frosting on RV is OMGyum. Cake is decent. nSC is regular cake, but good fluffy frosting and a noticeable salty taste. I'll be returning here to try their other flavors.",2
"Food is interesting and priced fairly by Vegas standards . The seasonal drink specials are pretty good. I really liked the Tamarind ""Martini "" although I fuckin' HATE when people call something a Martini just because it has Vodka in it and they serve it in a cocktail glass there was definitely NO Vermouth in the thing . The bartender was knowledgeable and proficient in her craft.",2
"Papa Trans Riblets are to die for! Moist, flavorful, get me a side of rice and ranch dipping sauce and I'm in heaven! If I could eat these for breakfast lunch and dinner I would, we drive 55 miles to eat these bad boys! Hint order the large size and don't share because seriously even if your full you can still eat more! My mouth is watering now for Papa Trans Riblets! Ok gotta go !",2
"The staff here was so nice! After being turned down at 2 other nail places for 4 walk in pedicures, LV nails were happy to accommodate us right away even though the salon was fairly busy and they were about to close for the night. It was such excellent customer service that we will definitely be back again!",2
"Rip off! 24 for a couple with two sandwiches, two soups and two drinks. The soup was very salty and tasted like any crap from old country buffet. The sandwiches were equally unspectacular. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Not sure why this place has such a high rating. Maybe people feeling they are cool for finding an alternative to Panera",1
"This place was awesome. The staff was all very friendly, professional and appeared to take pride in their jobs. The food and drinks were amazing. We had so many rolls I can't remember them all but they were all tasty. I strongly recommend the french bean tempura and shishito peppers. You can't go wrong with this place.",2
I went here with a friend on a Sunday at around 9 00 or 10 00 am since there was only 2 of us we only waited about 10 minutes. I ordered the wolf pack. It was really good! The service was fast friendly. The only thing I didn't like was they didn't serve coke products but other than that I really enjoyed the experience!,2
"Cool park! Plenty of parking, gorgeous grounds, and lot's of green space. Everything was clean and well kept, which can't be said about all parks. I enjoyed all the flowers and shade offered from the trees. I took my dog here for a walk and we had fun playing fetch on the open grass area. The LOVE also provided a great photo op ",2
I used to like this place and my favorite was the Thai Beef Jerkey and especially the sauce that came with it! My last encounter at Krung Thai wasa couple of years ago and there was a big piece of broken glass in my soup! WTF?!? When we confronted the manager and the crazy waitress they felt no remorse! So goodbye or laa korn Krung Thai!,1
"Wow, I'm surprised at the number of high ratings for this place. I went here with a friend after they opened up near where I live. The service was not great and the food was very meh. It seemed like it was probably better if you sat at the bar for drinks than a place to stop in for a pint and some grub at one of the tables. Not impressed.",1
"When I lived in this part of town years ago, this was my regular spot. Back then it was Skinny Dugan's Pub. Stopped in this weekend. Maybe my expectations are skewed, but it was terrible. I didn't even finish my 1 drink and had to leave. It was clean enough. Just dead, no crowd, no life, no interest from the bartender. Guess I was hoping for more.",1
"Dropped in for dinner after a long flight from Hawaii. I ate at the bar, and orders some appetizers and the fish. The food was not appetizing at all, and the portions were very small. The ambiance and service were great, but I found the food sub par for such a restaurant. I may try this place again.",1
"Awesome burgers and sides. Shakes were fine, but save the belly room for the burgers. We had the Gold Standard and the Rising Sun. Both were incredible, perfectly cooked, and had an very cool mix of burger additions, such as tempura avocado. Great spot for lunch and a 5 minute wait! Highly recommended.",2
"I agree the stuff here is overpriced, but I have a cashmere habit, and I dont mind paying 20 for a good piedce that came from a good store, not target or somewhere. The clot hing for grown people is usually priced better than the college stuff, for some reason. But they are in love with not that great labels Kate Spade etc.",1
"Went today to a cooking class that we bought from Groupon. The food was great and to be honest, I look forward to trying what we learned at home. Our waitress was good. My problem was the lack of hospitality from the owner and the chef teaching the class. It was really a turn off. For that reason, I would not recommend this class.",1
"Haven't been in for a while, but I had to get one of their new Smoky Red Chile Hand Battered Shrimp Tacos.it was really good. The sauce is sweet with a hint of heat, very nice. Had to get a Fish Taco as well, always a favorite of mine. Love their Chipotle salsa. Staff is always friendly, helpful. I think their food is worth the price, I'd rather eat here than a fast food burger joint.",2
"This club has changed a lot over the years, but this version is by far the best. Nice people hanging out and singing karaoke or watching comedy, or what ever brings them in. This is the best karaoke in town, bar none. Pappa T does a great job. The free comedy shows are also the bomb. Great job guys, keep up the good work.",2
"I came here around 11 30 on a Saturday afternoon and was happy to find the place pretty empty. I was with a party of 7 and service was prompt and very friendly. Everyone enjoyed the food, and there were a few good drink specials. I ordered a salmon pizza and loved it. It really seemed like the food was above average.",2
"Great Tasty Burger! Different and interesting topping combinations, toppings sides that really take your taste buds on a delicious trip. I got the Hangover Burger. Could not say one bad thing about it, and it was so good I ate the onions which I have always taken off on other burgers. Highly recommend.",2
"I had purchased a groupon or WS it a living social deal.anyway, the bread was so yummy and everything was so fresh. I had the 16 corned beef and turkey. Yummy. My husband had the roast beef sandwich with broccoli cheddar soup which he said was scrumptious! Owners and staff were pleasant and friendly. This will be our sandwich go to place now!",2
Really upset about this place. Went there specifically for item on ad. They were out and i was told i could get raincheck. Decided to wait in long line for only 4 items and get raincheck. Once i got up there and paid for my items i was told i couldnt get a raincheck. I like this store and go out of my way to shop here. But this will be my last vusit.,1
"For some reason, every time I come here I always think of those stabbings that took place here in '08. The mall itself has a really outdated look on the outside as well as the inside. I remember when this used to be the mall that everyone would come to. They have the same stores that most malls do, it's just a worn down dumpy atmosphere. I see a recovery in order.",1
"This place is AMAZING! Very fresh dishes, the smoothies look amazing so I can't wait to try one! We've always had super friendly service, and the bakery chef is the best! We love Mrs. Haas and the entire family Definitely recommend this place for anyone that is looking for healthy, GF, and super fresh options!",2
Ate here for first time. My wife's parents owned a Chinese take out restaurant so speaking from that perspective. This place is just OK. Nothing special and over priced. I ordered extra protein sumo protein and did not appear I got much more. Also there was a plastic twisty in my food. They were apologetic and gave me a 10 gift certificate but won't be back.,1
"It's been a while since I've had a Quizno's Sandwich. Groupon had a deal and I bought a few of them, so I had to come here. I had a regular Italian on Parmesan Bread w Chips. It was bleh.there was too much Dressing on the Sandwich and it overpowered the flavors. Also, the Bread lacked flavor. If it wasn't for the Groupons, I wouldn't come back. Return Factor 20 ",1
I've always received pretty good service in here whenever I had an issue with my iphone. We're always greeted the moment we walk in and are asked what the visit is for so they can direct us in the right direction. They have an area with ipads full of kids games where my son can sit and play while we're waiting for someone to help us.,2
"Visited a few weekends back and ate 2 meals there. Was very impressed with the wide range of food, and quality. Far better than most buffets in Vegas, while coming in at 30 basically. There's different types of food for all, including a rather deep roster of meats, pastas, and assorted fruits vegetables for everyone.",2
"One of the most disgusting experience recently. Veggie burgers sucks. Pizza what you order you will never get. ""David "" from Sugar Factory i ordered 2 pizza's both were not you packed and it was one of the worst pizza i ate. Morning breakfast coffee full of particles of coffee beans. I had to throw it even without sipping. I will never go again there and same message i will spread. Service Sucks.",1
"These hot dogs are soooo over rated. The "" MOST Disgusting "" hot dogs we've ever tried in our whole lives. We couldn't even eat them. WE chewed the and spat them back out. everything about them was sooo gross. And to think we paid 5 for each what a waste of money, if you are thinking about coming here save your money and go somewhere else.",1
"LOVE this place! We came here for a work lunch and I walked out full, buzzed, and happy. Order the cornbread. Order the trio. Hell, order anything you want. ALL of it is good. Crazy note There's a margarita called the ""Shemango "" that is AMAZING. They only allow you to order a maximum of three because of how strong the drink is. I finished the first one and felt like I drank five. SUCCESS!",2
Beautiful decor and great ambiance. nService was friendly but a little slow. nCocktails were excellent. nAppetizers were delicious. nRolls were average to above. nEntrees were average to below. I would definitely eat here again if I was staying at the Palms or partying at one of the clubs but I don't know that I would make a special trip over just for the food.,2
"With a name like Sexxpresso I was expecting the Hooter's version of coffee. I got the Hooter's part but the coffee was horrible. Espresso was somewhere between burnt and rancid. Blech. It'll take more than Hooter's to get me back. I don't care what the schtick is, you've got to have decent coffee. Blech. Blech. Blah. Yadda. Yadda. Yadda.",1
"This is the best place in Arizona for Vietnamese rice dishes. Also, there nem nuong and spring rolls are rolled with egg roll shells deep fried giving the overall rolls a nice crunch and texture when biting into it. This place is legit and the closest thing to a home cook meal. I eat here at least once a week D It reminds me of food from California.",2
"I was very impressed with the park they were able to create downtown. The quick food options are great, as well as the pubs. I am particularly fond of Pinche Tacos and the wine bar, Bin 702. My children enjoy the Disney gallery and the treehouse playground. I imagine this is the only place in the world where one can see a praying mantis shoot flames from its antennae.",2
"New location opened up on Warm Springs and Durango a few months ago. Very clean, as it should be. Customer service not so swell. I just went to see what the rant and rave was about their coffee. Sorry not impressed. If I had to compare the flavor to anyone else's coffee, I would have to say that 7 11 and theirs run a tie. I believe there is a drive thru for those on the run.",1
"No one wears a smile here. The line is hella long. The automated postage machine is friendlier than anyone I've ever encountered here. I walk in and I immediately want to take an anti depressant. I know now why people go ""postal "". But.it is a necessary evil. I sell stuff on Ebay so I need to mail stuff all the time.",1
"Walked into an empty restaurant about 1 30pm. Had read previous reviews so I was prepared for a long wait. Ordered two plates, waited about 35 minutes. It definitely has a ""hole in the wall "" look to it, but the food is worth the wait! I'm glad I trusted the other reviewers! I hope it's still around next time we're in Vegas.",2
"What a crappy hotel! If you have another option take it, do not stay here. Your car is better than this hotel. nThey gave us 1 king bed instead of 2 queens that we had requested. There is no room service and will not make the beds or clean up or vacuum the floor. nDo not spend any money on this hotel.",1
"This time our visit for high tea for four lasted 3 hours. They forgot that we had ordered more food, and maybe forgot about us completely. Of the petite fours, two of them were delicious and two were terrible due to oversalted cucumbers. This is a great price for high tea, but unless you are planning on a slow day and a long conversation, I would not come again.",1
"This is a really good find in the Arboretum! I have a gluten allergy and they are good about meeting my needs. I really enjoy the Satay and the Char Kway Teow. Beef chicken are both yummy. Their food is consistently good and I would definitely recommend them for a casual dinner, date night, dinner with kids, or takeout.",2
"If you like noise, this is the place. Couldn't even talk to table mates when music was not playing. Reminded me of the noise level of a championship game in a domed stadium after a team has scored. The waitress got two orders wrong since it was so loud. nBut if you go for the food, it was very mediocre and while not expensive, was overpriced for what they delivered. They do have good beer.",1
"My first rave ever! Such an amazing experience, can't wait to go back! nBeautiful scenery, many stages! Lots of lights and color! Loved it! MUST GO! However takes forever to arrive because of traffic. Taxi's get pricey so I suggest getting a shuttle pass or driving. Gets really hot so stay hydrated! 5 water bottle then free refill stations.",2
"When my mom visited me to my place. She requested me to have a simple lunch with a simple menu. Got here to taste their Turkey breast and my mom was very surprised with the taste and she loves it! Wow, thanks that I made the right choice. We completely had a good day! I wish they can extend up to dinner time.",2
"The Chinese vegetables were awesome, other than that, it was disgusting. I also had a hard time getting a Bloody Mary for lunch, really, isn't this Vegas, shouldn't I be able to get a BM 24 hours a day? I will NEVER be back.well, except maybe for breakfast, that is the time for a buffet I have ever liked anyway.",1
The burgers fries and chicken fingers were all awesome! The bun was nice and soft and all the toppings were really fresh! Yes a bit pricey but they are on groupon right now which made it a bargain especially for the quality of the food! Can't wait to try the cheese fries they look amazing! Love that the menu is simple it makes it easier for my kids to order! We will definitely be back!,2
"DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE! THE FOOD SUCKS AND THE PLACE IS DIRTY. IT'S A COMPLETE RIP OFF! My wife and I had a terrible time there. We were so disgusted with the food that we asked to speak to the manager. When the manager finally came out to speak with us, he said it was the chefs fault like he didn't know who the chef was. Do not waste your time and money at this place.",1
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE ! I love this whole little plaza they have going on here! Mekong supermarket is part of Mekong Plaza. The supermarket is huge. Produce is very fresh! large selection of fruits as well. Good sake selection check it out.very cool place.love that we have a place like this. I plan on being here so much i am going to learn how to speak Chinese or Vietnamese just by walking around. ",2
"Moonstones is an excellent shop. I am from out of town but was able to order a gift basket of incense, stones and oils over the phone and have it delivered to a sick relative nearby. Tell them what who you need it for e.g. a sick friend and they will personally construct the gift basket and deliver it if not too far away Worked perfectly for me and again they are very nice. Ask for Amy.",2
"The food is decent, the happy hour prices are excellent. Amy seems to be very good with the customers she chooses to engage. Unfortunately that didn't include us. nAlbert is very good. We have been here several times this was the first time we left dissatisfied and the first time Amy was our bartender.",1
Stopped by one night to have some Sake with the SO and was happy to find their HH menu. nSmall bottle 2.50 not bad. The food is pretty clean and authentic. nMy friend Chi tells me the owner used to work at Nobu's. nThat's saying a lot because Nobu is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in town. nThe decor could use some work. nService is excellent nNice neighborhood joint,2
"I used to like Del Taco but seriously? I heard the drive thru people having trouble because of the thick accent of the server and even though there was only one couple ahead of me, it took me ten minutes to get two tacos and a burrito. If I didn't have a coupon, I wouldn't have gone. I'll be throwing the other coupons in the trash. Just not worth the aggravation.",1
"I really needed some hot chocolate not long ago, it was cold outside and freezing in my office to boot. I ventured to the Dunkin Donuts in hopes to satisfy my craving, I got back to my office and took my first sip only to find that it was so watered down that it was undrinkable. I was seriously disappointed.",1
"I actually insisted on going here because my husband spent some time in Germany and I wanted to have a little German experience of my own. He recommended the Jaeger Schnitzel, which I went nuts over. I'm not a huge beer fan so I didn't get a boot but I had fun watching every other table enjoy theirs. The environment was really neat. Watching people polka dance was quite an experience as well.",2
Love Krispy Kreme unfortunately Xavier has to be the worst customer service guy. No smile no customer service and when we asked a question he was impolite. No just fricken RUDE. Come in if Xavier is not here. Or not at. All. ! nXavier get a personality or go work in a mine where you don't have to engage people because you are not good at it at all .,1
"Excellent little place with a friendly waitstaff and, more importantly, excellent Mediterranean food. The chicken schwarma was excellent, with subtle flavor and a crispy wrap served ""Arab style "". The beef kebabs were tender and well seasoned. Great place for a lunch that doesn't leave you feeling weighed down afterward.",2
"I took my daughter's Kymco here to have the exhaust pipe re secured to the block and both hand grips tightened. Picked it up next day and found the work to be done satisfactorily, for much less than their preliminary estimate. That doesn't happen very often. I was very satisfied with the service provided by this dealer.",2
"This B N is fairly new less than 5 years I think. The staff are very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Like most B N's they allow and encourage browsing of magazines and books alike. If they don't have the book you are looking for just ask someone and they will find it. Great place to hang out while my wife is shopping.lol.",2
Had the corned beef and the fish and chips. Both were very good especially the fish and chips. The fish was fresh and the batter was light.Just the way I like it. This place has plenty of good beers on tap and a huge beer bottle selection. Service was excellent and very friendly. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas.,2
"Have been to other locations before and loved it, so I thought I would try this one. My son has a different hairstyle than most boys surfer shag type and MANY hairstylists have messed it up tragically before, so when I called to make an appt, I asked who would be best to cut his hair.considering they had NO idea what I was talking about, I won't be risking trying them out.",1
"I LOVE this place! The selection of both cigars and alcohol is great! The decore is relaxing, and most of all it is female friendly. Every staff member I came across was pleasant and helpful. If you've got time to spend there relaxing, I would do it. It is not close to me and I still go every chance I get.",2
"I used to like shopping here. I don't like the NEW JCPENNY, it's confusing shopping in their store. Not a fan of the new style and merchandising. I can't even tell the employees from other customers, they are dressed so casual, I don't remember seeing a name tag to at least know that they work there.",1
"Used to be my favorite, but not anymore. Don't know if my taste buds changed or if the food quality changed. I usually order the same thing everytime I come here, but everything tasted alittle different. I always order the calamari, vermicelli noodles and side of pho. 30 min wait to one hour is a norm here. Don't think it's worth it anymore",1
"Jenny's designs are cool, creative and inspired. Not only that, but I love working with her! She's professional, hardworking and precise not to mention hilarious and so easy to work with. She listens to your needs and really gets to know who you are, so the designs reflect the best and most true version of you. I trust her creative eye and would recommend her to everyone.",2
"Mediocre food. 50 for one person. I could have had better food at Panda Express. The orange peel chicken was cold and lacking flavor. The veggies in the dish tasted like they weren't washed before being cooked. Only good thing about this place is the atmosphere, it is the only reason I didn't give it 1 star.",1
We just played the champions course on saturday and all I can say is that the entire maintenance crew has been at the Stadium course for a very long time and have not paid attention to the champions course. There are a lot more choices throughout the greater Scottsdale area that you can play at that are far better maintained than TPC.,1
"Have definitely had some challenges over the years, but I am glad that it seems to be turning around. Jason is awesome and the girls are amazing! Haven't been out on a Friday night in a while and stopped in to hear the music of the RJ band Robert and Joel were incredible! Great energy, great music! Wish I could have stayed longer!",2
Once u survive the line to get in.the food is great but typical vegas buffet food. Its too pricey unless u can take down 4 to 5 plates. Its not worth it. They charge extra for booze once u get in. And they throw away all the food at closing time in a garbage can. What a waste.but i guess its the norm,1
"I made a reservation for my daughters birthday. Requested a good table and we were seated in the back of the restaurant. There were available tables by the windows. We ordered filet and sea bass. The sea bass was not good. The filet was ok, but we've had many better steaks. The gnocchi was delicious. Our service was not up to par for a restaurant with these prices. We won't go back.",1
"This was the BEST! The food was freakin awesome! Our waitress was really flirty friendly. We had her create our menu. She made great recommendations coordinated a great fusion of everything from appetizers entrees. Everything tasted sooo delicious. I loved the sushi, coconut rice and the mini taco. It took awhile for the food to come but the ambiance was entertaining it was worth waiting for.",2
"Ordered wings burgers, food came all at once. Had to ask for blue cheese dressing for wings, which was ranch with blue cheese sprinkled over top AND we were surcharge for it. we didn't even touch the original ranch. PS Don't sit outside, wood benches are wet and sticky from misters. Go to another sports bar!",1
"Absolutely the worst experience ever. Not only was my burger made wrong, I mean it was extremely difficult mayo, mustard, pickles, lettuce tomato and cheese. what did I get? Ketchup, 3 lousy pickles, a smidge of mustard and lettuce and tomato. The burger was also cold. And I don't mean warm, it was cold. Disgusting. I will never be back to this Carl's Jr. Maybe not to any of them.",1
In Las Vegas there's nothing like a hot bowl of fresh noodles to top off a night of drinking partying and gambling. I wish it was as good as some of the best noodle places in Chinatown and LA but it isn't. Plus a star because there really are no other alternatives and I'd take their beef noodles any day out here in stony brook. Make this part of your Vegas weekend.,2
"OMG, I'm the first to review this place. My accountant is nearby, so we stopped here for breakfast. Let's just say I won't be going back for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Who ever heard of ala carte breakfasts? Order eggs and toast is a dollar extra? Juice glasses are a bit larger than a shot glass. It's now after 1pm and my stomach is still gurgling! Time for another dose of Pepto!",1
"Moses is the man! We purchased 90,000 worth of vehicles for just over 60,000. Good trade ins, excellent rebates incentives for two brand new vehicles. A California Special GT Mustang Ecoboost F 150 with all kinds of bells whistles! There are some great new used cars trucks on the lot, but if you don't see anything you like, they will find it for you!",2
"So good! Had no idea that this place even existed until 2 months back! So hooked to it now that I have been ordering take out every week! Tried their red and yellow curry, drunke noodles and pad thai so far! The curries are soooo good! Drunked noodles are really good too! My only comment is that their lunch special take outs are really small portions ",2
We have used Kenny's Lawn Service for the past couple of years and have found them dependable and reasonably priced. They have done a great job for us and have been very helpful regarding different types of questions we have for our plants and general yard management. The owner is very pleasant and nice to deal with. I would highly recommend Kenny's Lawn Service.,2
"This is a great local coffee shop! The environment is bright and inviting with huge windows and shelves full of books. Each time I have ordered an espresso drink, the barista has created a beautiful design in my foam this makes the drink so much more enjoyable The breakfast sandwiches are also delightful and are made fresh as you wait!",2
"In the competitive culinary world of Las Vegas, Fleur by Hubert Keller does not rate highly. Mr Keller's Manchego salad is routine and boring. The fleur burger is utter disappointment at its worst. The chef had difficulty cooking the burger to medium rare. The wine list is staid. With all the other choices in the Mandalay Bay and Las Vegas, venture somewhere else. nMonkey D",1
"I was hoping that the new location, with the potential of the off street patio, would be better than the old one. The coffee is okay, though neither good nor hot. The wi fi requires a ""strong "" password senseless and hard to type , and it's time limited. I hope that the courtyard area will get some love so it looks less like an alley.",1
"Wonderful place, and the best part is the drinks. I'd never had anything like them. The menu is creative, and I was introduced to fingerling potatoes, which YOU NEED TO GET! Believe me, they'll have you searching the Internet for a recipe that can somehow, perhaps, just maybe, certainly hopefully, come close to matching the wonderment in a plate. And get the pork chili verde. MMMMMM!",2
"Could this place be anymore crowded? I can't get down the aisles, due to crowding of staff, other customers running into me. One gigantic cluster fudge. I did end up buying Kale for my greek tortoise but that is everywhere so I won't be returning. Even then there is no order to checking out. Everyone just cuts in front of you and my God I couldn't get out of there fast enough.",1
"Not a fan of this place. The food is terrible and pricey, The staff is pretty terrible and ticket times run slow even though there seems to be a lot of them there. The dance floor is nice, but I don't like how they play hip hop or as they call it ""Top 40. "" With a name like Cactus Moon you think it would be straight country. The one great thing about this place is the pool table, they are great.",1
"I just move here from San Francisco a month ago, so my wife and I usually find some buffet places to try since it's a rare in SF. Today we hit Buffet Asia, Yes you can blame me for being brave after reading all the one star reviews. lol To make this review short. I WILL NOT EVER LOOK AT THIS PLACE AGAIN, even when passing by.",1
"Food was great. Wifi neede a little help, thus the 4 stars. Might have been good, but they didn't know passord, and fumbled with it a bit. We never got on the whole time we were there. Leaving, they finally go the password. But the FOOD! Wow awesome hummus, amazing falafel balls not an expert on this, bu they were very tasty .",2
"I travel A LOT for work, and trust me, i've had some pretty raunchy tasting stuff, but this was just absolutely great.I ordered a pineapple flavored cone, and it was so absolutely friggin' flavorful!No it may not be too good for my diet.but it was totally worth, stop by this place, it's definitely worth a shot.Or in this case.a cone.",2
"Had an awesome steak salad, peanut butter milk shake also great. Son enjoyed Chicken and Waffles. Husband's monti cristo sandwich was good but very small. The deserts were so disappointing. I have never had a worse cupcake in my life. I understood this would be a tourist trap and expensive. definitely wasn't worth the price.",1
"The food is decent enough but the service is quite bad. The owner is obviously an unhappy person that doesn't treat his employees well no matter who is around. We had a flyer that offered a free bottle of wine with two entrees. When we enquired about it the owner said we had to spend 50 each person in order to get it, amazing.",1
I love Starwood brand hotels. This Westin is a very well run hotel. I have stayed here several times for business. The service is excellent. The rooms well done. The catering is outstanding. The restaurants and bars are well done. The location is ok with a quick walk to the heart of Charlotte. Stay here you won't be disappointed.,2
"Fodd is definatly inconsistent. the first time we came here the pizza was great, so we tried something different and ordered the toasted sub which are great, had a pizza delivered this weekend not so great, it seemed to be half cooked and the side of the pizza was smushed like the driver was driving crazy to deliver. also this time wings were not so good. to bad little ceasers were closed ",1
Wow! What a transformation from the other bars! The staff is super friendly and fun and the food is great! I had the fish and chips and the Irish nachos! They were so yummy! They also have great happy hour with 1 2 off their already cheap drinks! I will be back again and will be telling all my friends to come to McFadden's!,2
"I am here every other week to pick up breakfast on my way to the office. They have great quick breakfasts you can order to go. It's cheaper than the nasty Deli in my office building. You can't beat the prices for the ""quick start "" options. I am so excited they expanded the restaurant, the plentiful bar seating is perfect if you need to eat and go quickly.",2
This super relaxed restaurant pub is pretty cool and BUSY Yuppie central! The food was pretty incredible had the ShaShuka BUT the latte was a bit of disappointment three mouthfuls and it was gone . Service was really good considering just how busy it was. Totally would recommend Sparrow but bring your own bowl or mug for latte! Will be back for sure!,2
"The food was good. The taste quality of the food was fantastic. Apps calamari, yellow fin sashimi. nEntrees Seared ahi tuna, short ribs, bone in rib eye nSides Mushrooms garlic snap peas nDrinks 3 glases of wine 1 cocktail. Cost 200 before tip. Great value! The view was breathtaking. n nThe service was a touch off because it was very slow. However they were professional accommodating.",2
"went back.and it was a mistake, i think they changed management but we spent 3 hours here and we only received two batches of crab legs. Our server was an older woman who moved very slowly, she also had an attitude but she was really good at hiding it with sarcasm. To make matters worse, the manager is super ditzy and seemed to have no control!",1
"I've never been a huge fan of RA but I decided to give them one last chance tonight, and it will be my last. The service was absolutely terrible and the food was mediocre at best. The waiter was rude and we were halfway done with our meal before he brought out our drinks. This was yet another bad experience at RA sushi and it will be my last.",1
"I must admit.the pies in here are amazing. It's not often you'll hear me saying I love pies haha but they are amazing here. It doesn't look like much to a passer by, but keep an eye out for this charming little bakery! The prices are reasonable for the quality you get, so it's definitely worth a look!",2
"The hubs I had an excellent experience here. Having never shot a gun before, Livio our range safety officer guided me through the process with ease patience. I thought guns weren't for me, but I'd go back without hesitation. And the hubs, he was a kid in a candy store I think he might've even giggled with glee. See if you can ask for Livio he was great.",2
"Im really surprised at some of these negative reviews! Ive never had anything but terrific service food here. Whether its at the inside bar, restaurant, sushi bar, or outside bar and tables. One of my fave things to do is sit at the back bar w friends and have just a drink on the way to another bar, or a full dinner. Its place I always check for seats 1st.",2
"Had brunch here on New Year's Day. Absolutely fabulous food! Artfully presented you feel bad even eating eat! Brunch was a three course set menu. It was a bit overwhelming at first as it seemed like a lot of food, but the courses were well balanced and of good proportion. They appeared and tastes rich but were not too filling.",2
"Pronounced ""Me Choke On "". Stomach ache after eating here. When this restaurant used to be located in a much smaller venue, it once had authentic, delicious, purposeful meals. Now that they've moved to this larger location with no doubt, a great view, I'm not sure what happened. Hopefully they go back to their good food roots. Otherwise, maybe better off enjoying the view from the outside.",1
This place is very good. My wife and I went with another couple who ordered different dishes so we were able to try many things. Beef and chicken were great. Also tried a beef lamb mixture which was really good as well. Staff is very friendly and knowledgable about the dishes. We will be back without a doubt.,2
This place is great. My fianc u00e9 took me here for my first time about a week ago and it is now my favorite place to eat. It a little expensive but well worth it. I got the Farm Burger and that burger was 10x better than any burger at Red Robins and that's saying something! Super great place for children,2
"I just took my daughter and her friend here looking for donuts as we are new to the area, we have never heard of a Kolache before but the girls got one to try, they loved it and said the donuts are good as well ! The gentleman working was very nice and helpful but doesn't speak English so well . Looks like we'll be coming back. Wish they were gluten free for me ",2
"Was here on saturday with a few friends, got there about 4 45 parking lot was empty. walked in and there was a 15 minute wait? Anyway we got seated in about 15 minutes and the service was excellent, the food was good and plenty of it. Looks like they are stepping up their game again, Monti's was on a downhill slide for quite awhile",2
"I have eaten hear over the years. Most of the time on Happy hour. The menu for happy hour always changes and seems to be decent. Good flavors, ok size. The reason why it only gets 2 stars in my book. Turn the fucking music down! The tech music they play sucks! It is hard to hold a conversation with that shit turned up to ""11 "" If you can handle that then enjoy.",1
"When I made the no refund reservation there was no mention of construction, but the courtesy reminder one week prior to my stay informs me that there is construction for the entire month. Fire alarm at 3 am. Fire alarm at 4 am and the person at the front desk when I check out at 530am asks how was my stay. What planet was he on?",1
"I absolutely loved this place! My husband and I came here for my birthday and I have to say that everything about it was amazing! The ambiance was breathtaking and the service was simply great. And of course, the food was delicious! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for great food along with a modern atmosphere!",2
I had the petite filet sides. It is a nice place to go for dinner. The cocktails were on the weak side. The steak was wonderful and the lobster mac and cheese was dry good with large chunks of lobster. I love Brussel sprouts but theirs really wasn't that great I would definitely go back but skip the Brussel sprouts opt for wine.,2
"Seriously? nI must have come on an off day. nOther reviews sing high praises of this place, I'm not getting it. nMy food was bland like I had a head cold, no flavor at all. I was worried when my hot sour soup was nether hot or sour. nAnd how rude is it the owners children where playing in the dinning area? nThe counter person was very nice, that's about it.",1
"This Starbucks was busy when I went. There was a convention for the NFR national finals rodeo that weekend. It had all kinds of different customers, from convention vendor personalle workers because I saw badges around their necks. I ordered a hibascus, consistent in taste to other Starbucks, a little bit pricer duh it's vegas . It was clean and there was free wifi available.",2
"This is the type of place were it in NYC or Chicago it would be getting national attention as a foodie hotspot. Madison is lucky to have it.for the superb craft cocktails alone. The carnivore centric food is often brilliant and always of good quality. Highly recommended. Beware though, the place is small and you will need to wait at peak times for seating.",2
"I like Sprouts. Good variety, decent prices. Two stars because the cash register clerks are so busy with chatting with each other, they lack good customer service skills. Multiple times I've been there and it's always the same case! Went there today and they packed my rawest with fresh veggies! Gross and a cross contaminatioightmare. Going to have to keep my eye on it next time.",1
"cool menu with fresh ingredients, cool concept. One big problem is they are EXTREMELY SLOW! Service and way to expensive. If you plan on going here for lunch break between work you my not get you food in time before you need to go back to work. Plus everything is very pricy, 12 16 oz drink will run you 8 bucks! If you order a meal you will easily run you over 25 bucks.",1
"I've been coming to this Starbucks for about 6 years. It used to be awesome, but lately they are seriously understaffed. You shouldn't have to wait 25 minutes for a latte. Line out the door an 2 people working. Step it up and hire some more people already! This has been my experience the past 4 times in here.",1
"The Fresh Market is a cool little store with tons of fresh meats, produce and bakery goods. I browsed through the store and was pleased with the variety I found, lots of organic selections as well! They have tons of great ready to eat meals as well, I can see me returning for a salad or wrap in the very near future!",2
"Came back after NYE. I got Steak Frites, the girls got Pork Cheek and Roasted Chicken. All were really delicious. I like some burns in my food so my steak medium but a bit toward rare had some burn on the outside is yummy to me. The Pork Cheek, however, was amazing. It literally melt in your mouth! nAnd yes, had to get the beignets!",2
This place is ghetto. The buffet is nasty. The Mexican restaurant is pretty good. This plAce Is dirty and nasty. A lot of lowlifes hang out there. Expect to see thugs and pimps and prostitutes and drug dealers there. The staff is not friendly and the gaming sucks. The parking lot Is dangerous so be careful and hold your wallet and purse!,1
"This place is one of my favorites! Great happy hour, convienient valet, and the food is excellent.I reccomend the pork sandwich! However.My only complaint is they got rid of the Charcuterie on the menu. I was really distraught over that as I had been craving it! oh well.plenty of other good stuff there to eat!",2
If I'm staying at the Venetian or Palazzo I always end up eating here. Grand Lux comes from the same company as Cheesecake Factory so their food is very similar. There's a variety of different foods to choose from that can satisfy anyone. The food is equally good. Major plus is that food is available from Grand Lux 24 7 so perfect for drunken munchies to take to your room.,2
" Inside ambiance was very nice for a large restaurant. I had the blue cheese crusted, bacon wrapped filet mignon. Ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly. Very, very tasty steak. Also had the twice baked potato and that was very well done as well. It was all what I expected for the price that your paying. Very good meat.",2
"This mall is scary! Back in the early 00s I worked there and it was getting bad then think jewelry store holdups, constant fights gang and non gang related , and TONS of car thefts. The mall used to be good, in the mid 90s, but it really has gone down hill. Many of the stores are even crappy. I wouldn't waste my time or money here.",1
"I have never been to a filipino restaurant, so I really don't have anything to compare DJ Bibingkahan to. I am glad we have a filipino friend in the group to introduce this cuisine to us. Though. I still am not sure what I ate. She pretty much went up to the line and pointed at various dishes. Next thing I know, we have a whole table worth of food for the four of us and everything tasted great!",2
The Charlotte Museum of History is an important part of the Charlotte community. It is dedicated to preservation of the Revolutionary War era of Mecklenburg County. The jewel of the museum is the Rock House oldest house in the county. I have visited many times and really feel the staff does a great job. Go visit!,2
ok i had the buffet which did this restaurant no justice! We had dinner Sunday night and it was amazing! Indian food is my new favorite cuisine. We had the tandoori platter with lamb and chicken and a veg curry entree saffron rice onion kulcha bread and they have Taj Mahal beer. Every thing was phenomenal. Must go here! Dessert was the cheese ball yummy!,2
"This is actually a really nice library but growing up here I guess I take it for granted. Has lot's of computers and large child's section. It's under renovatioow and there were quite a few homeless people sleeping in the library lol, So I still won't go no matter how nice it is after the remodel LMAOO. I could see a rape taking place here in the future.",2
"This place is a great escape from the sometimes pricey rest of the strip. Great for those dicey situations where you blow all your money on dancing gals but still have a day left on your vacation. Very cheap booze, 2 beer all day and 3 beer hot dog combos. Solid casino with cheap table game limits. Nice little dive bar for when the opulence of the nicer places overwhelms you.",2
"There's not many 24 hour Subway places so I thought I should put up that this is the newest location to do so. They just put their sign up Yeah, it's still fast food, but it's not bad tasting and not the worse thing I can be eating at 3am. Sometimes a late night tuna sandwich or some cold cuts and veggies just sounds nice.",2
"Service was good, they were very attentive and friendly. The decor was inviting. I wanted to give them a chance even if reviews weren't good. I ordered Miso ramen and was very disappointed. The chashu was overcooked, miso was not freshly made and choice of ingredients just did not work out. I hope they can improve this and perhaps I might go back.",1
"The decor was nice, but the place is way to small and crowded. You spend half the time standing around waiting in line to get a halfway decent beer and the other half standing around waiting for a seat. At least it was appropriately priced. I also think its odd that people are bringing children into a place where the smell of hops is so strong. Definitely hipster central.probably won't be back",1
"BOOOOOOOOOOOOO to this place. nHorrible tourist trap. Overpriced, but the food is ok. Kitschey garbage all over. Horrible band playing music on 11 NONSTOP. So miserable trying to eat there. Yodeling and accordion and such. Food ok but 4.50 for spaetzle, other sides. Guess I should have expected this in Vegas.",1
"This place is uncomfortable just to be there! Not a friendly place and you dont feel welcome! Went there and felt we were rushed to get the order,.but the main issue was that it was not crowded, which should have been a red flag,.but we ordered a salad in addition to our meal and never got it! Will never ever go there again!",1
"Dont go here if your from out of town, they would not serve us because we had a out of state Id.Utah really they missed out on a 100.00 bill plus what ever we would have spent on their machines.Tell all your friends that your friends weren't allowed to drink here.So don't go here! I think thats discrimination!",1
"Burgers are outstanding! You must try the pretzel bun! Then make sure in a group you try the different fries, onion rings, zucchini, etc. The dessert burger was delish! I absolutely loved the glazed donut burger idea. So fun! nI gave it 4 stars because they charge for every part of the burger. Be prepared to spend 15 for just the burger. Its a pretty big burger and so delish.",2
I would give zero stars if I could. They kicked out the wounded warriors group who had reservations for this weekend because another group paid more money than them to stay at the hotel Shame on you for treating our veterans this way. Great appreciation for our troops westin. Where are your morals and values?,1
Worst frozen yogurt place I have been to yet. Usually no problem with places but this place was worth the bad review. The customer service was very rude to my group of people. Pricey and the people at yogurt places are usually a little more happy but she was rude and didn't care about her attitude towards anyone.,1
"Terrible food, awful service, and the place looks really run down inside. It used to be good several years ago, but this place has done nothing but go downhill. And honestly, judging by the food, I'd be worried about what goes on behind the scenes in the kitchen. This restaurant is a poster child for Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares.",1
"Good location, bad service. It was not a busy Thursday night, but our waitress was literally 20 minutes in between stops. The nachos were not really nachos. More of a salad mixed with some tortilla chips, that happen to be burnt. Christina ordered a lavosh thingy and it came out cold. The food was way overpriced. I only had one drink. It was stiff, so that is good. This place was just really meh.",1
"Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere.this is a regular spot for me and my friends. The drinks are well poured and the music is always good. Pay attention to the rotating art on the walls and the off beat classic movies playing on the screens. The creativity of the drink menu shines through, especially with the White Rabbit.",2
"Its nice in here, I love the upstairs! They have a pool table and all kinds of board games to play. My husband,friends and I had fun. The only bad thing was the female bartender was too busy being cute to serve us in a timely manner and we would have to walk downstairs to get our drinks nI dont think I will be returning",1
"Not a huge ice cream fan but we've gotten cones from this location a few times. I also got my daughter's birthday cake here this year. Great service and yummy ice cream. The price is a little high for cones but surprisingly, the ice cream cake was less expensive here than at Baskin Robbins and Dairy Queen.",2
This is the only place I like eat specialty sushi rolls at. They have a good deal for 25 all you can eat. It's great cause I can have 3 to 4 rolls and my fav's all cost 13 a roll anyway. I have been coming here for a long time and don't plan to stop. The staff is really nice too. They also have a lunch special for 2 rolls 14.00. Love it!,2
"After losing my aesthetician about a year ago due to relocation I decided to venture out and give Skin Sensations a try. I am so glad I did since my skin requires a cool touch laser. Jo Ellen, is so sweet, and gentle. She knows what she is doing and I am razor free! Go see Jo Ellen, you will be so glad you did!",2
Really this cost money I have had better food on cheap buffets. Bread and tea was ok. Had chicken Marsala little chicken pieces not to bad until you got a bite of the garlic it was bad. Would not go back if it was free. Wife had chicken under a brick the potatoes where cold chicken was dry. Not recommended. Go to bk,1
"Delicious Punjabi style paneer curries and Malai kofta. I especially recommend the Shahi Paneer with garlic naan. The ambiance is very good too. nI've ordered to go several times and on every occasion I've received yummy complimentary gulab jamun! nOverall, a great value for money. nThe only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is because the buffet lunch does not have a wide selection.",2
Very affordable spot in Old Montreal other places nearby I found to be very over priced. There's a great selection of pasta dishes and a delicious salad bar is also included in the price. Even the bread and garlic butter brought to the table was very tasty! I had a traditional spaghetti dish and it was very filling!,2
"Total bummer. Saw a picture in a magazine in the hotel and went. Menu was basic Mexican. Flavor was mediocre, prices were high for what we got. Service, well, that alone was enough to make us never come back, none of the staff seemed to want to be there. I really wanted to like this place but just couldn't muster up even 2 stars.",1
"This place is a Madison secret tucked away for locals that appreciate good pizza. If you like thin crust pizza, this is about as good as it gets in Madison. The classic Italian food is good as well. A reasonably priced restaurant that is a must for a relaxing evening with friends. A little off the beaten path if you are downtown, but worth the ride.",2
"Maybe the only place in AZ that makes their own pasta? 5 stars by Arizona standards, 3 by Italy and other foodie joints across the globe hence the compromise. Sorry AZ, you are on a relative scale. I was bummed, because I was the only person in this restaurant for an hour and a half at 7 on a thursday night. Finally a good Italian joint in Phoenix and nobody shows up. I hope this place survives.",2
Won't stay here again. Its clean and staff is nice. The restaurant staff stopped caring about their paying guests. Its order.then here's your food and your check. They never follow or ask hows your food nothing. The beds are hard! I've paid the less and felt like I got my moneys worth. But not here.,1
"Cilantro lime hummus? bomb! fish and chips? F ing fantastic!Beer? two thumbs up! Atmosphere? very chill.love the setup! Service? good considering the poor thing was basically running the whole area by herself, but still had a smile each time we waved her down for some help. Great find.i will be checking in here soon.",2
"I thought this show was kind of like STOMP, so I was really relieved that it wasn't lol . It was a fun show. I did not expect the things to happen that did and although 3 4ths of the way through I was crazy tired, it got a few laughs outta me although some people in the audience were dying laughing can't understand why . I wouldn't see it twice, but it's a show that you want to see at least once.",2
Called and asked for information about them and got hung up on twice. Sad because I waited about 10 minutes on hold only to get hung up on when I asked about the information on the website. All they wanted was my credit card number to charge me to become a member and I couldn't find out anything about them.,1
"Miracle worker, Michelle King, has done it again. The Grey is gone and replaced with vibrant color! The cut and style is so complimentary and easy for this working mom to replicate. The support staff at Zynergy are also wonderful. A hot cup of coffee was brought to me and I was asked by several staff if I needed anything. Everyone is always pleasant and friendly at Zynergy.",2
"Service was cheerful, if slow. The smoked meat sandwich, medium, was cold and tasteless. The turkey with Swiss was tasteless as well. nNeither of us finished our sandwiches. Oh, and the mustard was requested but somehow forgotten. nWhile this place is convenient for us, whenever we want a good smoked meat sandwich, we will certainly NOT be coming back here. Shamefull.",1
The nightclub opens around 5 and is directly on top of and open with the restaurant. It was so noisy I had to talk loudly for my fiance to hear me. The satay of Chilean sea bass was great. The filet mignon was over cooked and dry. The chinese sausage fried rice and buddhas feast were both good. The service was sub par on our visit. Service was so slow we had to rush to make our show.,1
"This location can get very busy and at times they really need more help cause I don't think they have enough employees. However, the entire staff is very friendly and helpful. They work very hard and I just wish they had more help. Love love love the coffee. To me it tastes very smooth and has great balance. Love their sesame bagels, too! All in all a good value for your money!",2
"My husband and I went to Tony's at the Galleria and it will be the last we go. It took them at least 35 minutes to get a calzone, stromboli and salad. The salad was 7.25 and should have been 2.00. Iceberg lettuce, brown at that and some feta and olives thrown on. Of course, we got no salad dressing. nDon't go!",1
"I really enjoy Lawry's. Even though I live within 10 miles of one, I generally go to the one in Las Vegas when I'm there. The food is always consistently great and the staff is always friendly. I'd like to say I get the Beef Bowl Cut, but I'll be honest, the California Cut with Sides is enough to satisfy me and leave a little room for dessert.",2
"Ordered XLarge crab. 1 2 hour later for take out. They were going to give me the uncooked version. So after 15 more min. I received the regular size crab. I asked, this can't be the XLarge size. He said. That it is becuz we measure it. Dude I'm still in my server restaurant outfit for Caesars, I'm not stupid, that's a mini me crab.",1
I'm a picky eater and and thought the steak fundido was great. Order a Boss margarita with this and you are guaranteed to enjoy your experience. I would have given them 5 stars but the wait was frustrating. We were told 20 minutes which really ended up being almost an hour. One of their bartenders was our waiter and he did a great job turning our frowns upside down.,2
"I placed an order today for several ""try 2 "" combos with sandwich and either salad or soup to go. All of the sandwiches and soups salad were excellent. Good portions at a very reasonable price. Tiffany was very helpful and even gave me a drink while I waited for my order. I will definitely be back very soon.",2
"This place is overrated. The service was extremely slow and the waitress never asked us how our food was. I got the jambon croissant with ham and side salad. The salad tasted like someone dipped the lettuce in a pepper shaker. I'm a pretty big foodie, was excited to eat here and ended up being extremely disappointed.",1
Awesome stadium love the atmosphere here and also that you can sit outside of friday's and see the game back in 2007 i caught the game winning ball when the played tampa bay i was on the jumbo tron it was sweet and the staff quickly approached to make sure i was ok and if i wanted my ball signed by the player who hit it which was Chris Young i have and will return again for games here,2
Quite possibly the worst service in the entire town of Mesa. Our server was young with braces and the one of the most air headed persons I've ever met. After confirming that I wanted my eggs sunny side up 2 different times she still brought them out scrambled like I wouldn't notice. The food also took 40 minutes to get out of the kitchen. I'll never be back. Fudge this place.,1
"This is the second times I used Robert for my carpet. As always and as the other reviewer said, he is the GUY for carpet cleaning. Reliable, professional, and passionate about what he does. The carpet in my home looks great again. I had Robert cleaned the carpet at my aunt's house few months ago, and she loves it. Thank you Robert for your wonderful caring about your business. nHoang",2
"Breakfast was decidedly underwhelming. My husband's bfast sandwich was average at best and my egg burrito was the worst I have ever had. The eggs were burned, almost black, and tough. How do u make eggs tough? Service also horrible. The guy serving us was not familiar with the menu, we had to flag him down for more coffee, and would someone please buy him a personality?!",1
"I've been here mainly to use their conference facilities for work. So I will not be critiquing their rooms. But if you're looking for a place to hold an event this would be a great place. And Sangria's is always busy with people enjoying happy hour and pool. They are attentive to detail and if your boss asks you for last minute miracles, their staff is great at making it happen.",2
Really really really good food. Love the drink options. You caearly choose anything you want from the machine. I cringe to see the one reviewer here comparing this place to Subway. Laughable. Sorry. Of course Subway is cheaper. Their ingredients are cheap. Firehouse has a really well made sub and it can't be compared to the sh tuff Subway makes.,2
"Not only is Faberg u00e9's food delicious, they're also super Yelp friendly. I checked in at brunch and to my surprise, an offer came up for a free non alcoholic drink. Love it! All in all, this is probably one of my favourite brunch spots. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is great don't know what else to say. everything is just spot on.",2
"Um, no. What do you do with a beautiful old train depot? You fill it with so much color it looks like Sherwin Williams barfed in every corner. IT so 1980's, so falsely cute. I just loathe the interior. To be fair, my chicken pablano was reasonably good and the server was steady. But the atmospherics are deigned to wow unsophisticated frat boys from the nearby U. No thanks.",1
I went here to get my nails done about a year ago and they were completely rude to me and my nail technician cut me several times with her drill. She also drilled my real nails down so bad that I have dents in a couple of my nails that have never healed. Go up the street to Royal Tuyet Nails by Albertsons. Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better.,1
R m towing is just not acceptable. They have done the worst job at hiring staff members and running a business. They have no customer service skills at all and are down right disrespectful. Very rude and incompetent. Good luck dealing with these folks. I'm sorry for anybody whom may come into crossroads with these people.,1
"The Overlook Grill is one of the greatest restaurant's I've been to in Vegas to date. They have an amazing outside area that overlooks pools, ping pong tables, pool tables, and huge flat screens. The waitress asked what our plans were for the night we were interested in going to see the show Le Reve , and she called one of her close friends and attempted to get us free tickets, what great service!",2
"Cool atmosphere, good music, friendly staff, and pretty yummy food! Their mint and basil lemonade is so refreshing. We tried about 6 dishes and my favorite so far was the Sticky bun tacos. The bun was so light, pork belly melted in my mouth, and pickled cabbage was so crispy and full of flavor. I'll be back to try the Monte Cristo!",2
"I really really wanted to like this place because it's relatively close to our house. The prawns on our salad were not cooked all the way, and the Tom Yum Gong soup was bland. Not sure how you can make that soup bland, but they did it. The under cooked food was enough to cure me for life I won't go back.",1
"They suck at working on Japanese cars as well, they FAILED miserably at making some basic repairs on an old '93 Honda Accord I had several years back, and after going back to them four times they STILL couldn't get it right. If you give a sh t about your car, DO NOT TAKE IT TO ANY SUN DEVIL AUTO LOCATIONS! Total scam artists.",1
"I would give them 6 stars if I could for customer service. I had a bouquet delivered to the wrong funeral home bad luck both funerals were for people with the same last name . When I called the next day, the were willing to ship another bouquet to the correct address for free. you don't get service like that often.",2
Aaahh crap I think Cosmo spoiled me. We down grade this time around since my friend can only get Mandalay bay from his company expense account So let's get to it. Pros nDecent room. nComfortable bed nBuffet's coffee was fantastic. Can someone hook me up with their coffee brand? nCheap room rate Cons nLong long wait at the elevator nLots of family nTerrible poker room nNo AC in the elevator,1
"Horrible people work for the Las Vegas Monorail. If it weren't for their horrible employees, I might give them more stars, because occasionally their services can be useful although not cheap . However, horrible service 1 star. Oh and FYI, don't bother going to a station after 1am if you think you're going to pay with a credit card. Because you're not.",1
First words that come to my mind after seeing this spectacular show of cirque de Soleil is WOW WOW! It is truly something else. Well worth the bucks. Now it's hard to find nice shows under 150 for some good seats with view. If you want to Make the most of your trip treat yourself to this wonderful show.,2
"Was out of town for business and decided to try this place out. bad decision. I'm surprised they're still in business. I should have done my research but basically, this place sucks. The food was terrible and extremely bland. For the price, I expected more quality dishes. You're better off going to Pick Up Stix if they have it in AZ or some type of Asian buffet.",1
"Dear car wash ""sales people "", when you get passive aggressive sarcastic with me when I turn down your ""amazing "" detail windshield offer, you pretty much guarantee I will never purchase those services from you.ever. Just give me the car wash I asked for please. Oh, and some gum would be good to attempt to hide the overwhelming smell of weed when you come talk to me.",1
"One of my favorite buffets in Vegas. I come here everytime. There is huge selection of dishes, and service is EXCELLENT here. I would recommend coming here if you want to enjoy a Vegas buffet. This buffet lives up to its name it'll satisfy ALL your CRAVINGS Personal favorites nShrimp cocktails no shells! nCrab legs nStrawberry waffles during breakfast buffet ",2
"The person answering the phone might be the single worst employee I've ever encountered. I asked to order a delivery and he said, ""I'm too busy "" and hung up the phone. When I called back mostly in disbelief that a business would hang up on a customer he and asked if he wanted another attempt at my business, ""I'm sorry you feel that way bye "" and hung up immediately.",1
"AMAZING! We were in town for business personal and local friends of our suggested Don Charlie's.was wonderful. We had frog legs I was skeptical but then I tried them and they really do taste similar to chicken, kids! My 'chicago style' steak was heaven, vegetables were cooked to perfection and the potatoes were delightful. Love it, Love it, Love it!",2
"I absolutely love this place, the food is amazing and the beer is excellent. The owner and managers are always willing to stop and chat and want your feedback. My boyfriend and I recommend OHSO to everyone we meet and are normally there a few times a weeks. We love bringing our friends and our dogs to OHSO every chance we get. The best part is it's only 3.5 miles from our house.",2
Went here for lunch. Not many young people were eating here but the atmosphere was great. I had the trainwreck sandwich. It was loaded with meat and the bread was freshly made. Everyone else in my party had a gourmet burger and everything was devoured. My husband said when his family comes to visit he will be taking them here.,2
I see Elliott once a month and always look forward to my treatment! He is very skilled in massage and definitely knows what he is doing. I've had hundreds of massages and he is definitely among the best! Recently he added cupping to his services and I love this treatment to really loosen up the tissue and detoxify. He is an absolute professional!,2
"Loved the New York New York. Staff was friendly, great service, hotel room was clean and beautiful. We had a view of the roller coaster and also the MGM grand. We were able to check in early, our room was ready for us which made it very convenient to drop off our luggage and freshen up before hitting the strip. Casino and restaurants were great as well! Definitely had a great stay!",2
"Breakfast and lunch are so so but the dinner buffet sucked so bad I couldn't finish my plate, definitely be going elsewhere to eat tomorrow. I'm very disappointed that there is not a discount when you are staying at the hotel. We won't be staying at the nugget again. They charge you 5 if you want to look at there buffet. Disappointment all around.",1
"We really enjoyed this place. We ate lunch here yesterday. The Delmonico Steak Sandwich was really good, the homemade chips and the fries were also great! My daughter had a grilled cheese and literally ate every bite. My wife said the sweet tea was really good too. The service was awesome. I would definitely recommend it!",2
"I had the Veggie wrap from here today. It was so small, I felt like I was holding a baby sausage. It was all wrap, no veggies. My friend had the Greek salad, but they don't carry a greek salad dressing ? , so she wasn't exactly pleases. nLooked like they had a lot of comfort food, but nothing really suitable for lunch.",1
"I felt strangely out of place by the staff. I was given dirty looks and my questions received no answers. However, I noticed others received preferential treatment. Why? I was the only Caucasian male in the store. Maybe I ventured into the wrong business? Bah! That's silly! People don't think that way anymore. Right?",1
"It's a good place for a burger but I do feel their are better places. Don't get me wrong, I like the food but it's not in my top 5. The burgers are good but the fries are always like warm. The place is always spotless which is important to me. It says they care about quality but could use better fries. I'm from Texas and WHATABURGER is really better",2
"Anyone who's been in Vegas for awhile knows that the coffee shops that aren't the GlobalMegaCorp Starbucks but have a Seattle coffeehouse feel are few and far between. I live in Seattle, and can vouch for the fact that every time I come here, I feel like I've been transported back into Seattle, if only for a short amount of time. Excellent coffee, friendly baristas, and huge comfy sofas.",2
"It was my first time coming into the salon and it was honestly the best salon that I've ever been. Vivian is so awesome and did my pedicure, gel mani and she threaded my eyebrows. Everything was clean, professional and the service was fantastic. I definitely found my new salon here! And I will absolutely be asking for Vivian again!",2
"First, went in to get two pairs of trousers hemmed. Woman kept laughing after every sentance. I KNOW I'm funny looking, but at least have the decency to laugh behind my back. Then, when I went to pick up my items, there was a LARGE ATTACK DOG IN THE BUSINESS. Why should I be subjected to a pit bull to pick up my clothing. It was hardly worth 25 or more! Will NOT return.",1
"I saw a coupon online for 50 off, so I called to get a quote on replacing my brake pads. I told him the make and model of my car, which is a fairly commoon luxury vehicle. He said he wouldn't know the cost until he saw it and I had to bring it in. He said it could be from 100 to 1000, but he wouldn't know until he did an inspection.",1
This place is like my family. My 2 kids girl 12 and boy 7 have been apart of this Karate center for almost 2 years. Both kids have grown so confident and continue to learn. This is a the real deal in town. Mr. and Mrs. Young are incredible with all age groups. . We are so blessed that we found CD Young's Professional karate Center. We LOVE this place!,2
"I ate here 3 of the 5 days that we were in town. I've NEVER in my life eaten jumbo shrimp cocktail like this. It was amazing. I ate it all three times. When Jesus wants jumbo shrimp, this is where he eats it! It's that good. LOL! Be prepared, the red cocktail sauce has a kick. But it's so good that you can't stop eating it. Yummy in my tummy Mommy!",2
"I miss the greek express this place is nice but no worth the 4.00 more charge. Very nice remodel, but gone is the friendly service this place has an identity problem it wants to be a restaurant, but with all the TV's is trying to be a sports bar which it is not and will never will be. I will not be going back.",1
"Very nice place to eat. I was in the area, so I decided to stop by. I was definitely impressed with the quality of the food. Price is what it is for this kind of food. You get what you pay for, high quality Persian food. I got the sultan plate with beef kubideh and tenderloin kabob. Both were outstanding. Will out it on my favorite list when I'm in the area! Keep it up.",2
"Are you kidding me? This place is awesome ! The service is great and the owners are very nice . The food is authentic Mediterranean . I had the lamb and beef gyros, out of this world. The perfect blend of spices on the meat was savory goodness. My wife had the Mediterranean , everything was excellent . One must try this wonderful place and for us it will be a regular !",2
"Went there on a Groupon. Started with the bruschetta, and the bread was soggy and the tomato toppings were ice cold. Next up was the pizza. There were burnt areas of the crust, which is ok on a brick oven pie, but the dough was not cooked thoroughly and was disgusting. There are many other places that offer good pizza in the area without wasting time and money here.",1
"Gotta love 10 everything deals! I always try to stop by whenever I'm in Vegas, I love love love the clutches here. At 10 each, I can afford to get every color to match with my outfits lol. The ones I bought, none of them broke down on me yet. I don't really care for the watches, sunglasses, pashimas, etc offered in this store but whatever floats your boat, as long as you're getting a deal!",2
Stopped in to get help replacing a pendant and sconce that we had bought years ago. The lady who helped me was not very helpful and seemed bothered to even give me minimum information. I had a bad experience a year or so ago with customer service here but hoped they might have improved in this area.nope!,1
Always good after many visits over the last ten plus years. If they have the pumpkin empenada you must get it. The slow roasted garlic pork is amazing and even though I haven't had it for years after going vegetarian I still recommend it to everyone who accompanies me to Los Dos Molinos. They all love it!,2
"Surprised at all bad reviews. Came here with the wife and our three kids. Had the Kiss My Bass, Sweet Thang, Rainbow, and Geisha. Kids split a California and an udon soup. Everything was great, and our waitress was awesome. Only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that great sushi isn't really possible in the middle of the desert without paying an arm and a leg .",2
It took forever to get our food. I ordered a salad. Everyone else ordered a pizza. They got and finished their pizzas before I even got my salad. The waiter did not offer to comp anything. Service was slow. We even joked that the reason we didn't see our waiter was because he must be in the back cooking that would explain everything.,1
"I'm giving them 2 stars only because I have been there before and it wasn't horrible. This visit was disgusting! The restaurant is dirty, our food came out cold and tasteless, and the service was the worst! She did not offer coffee or soda refills she had a scowl on her face the entire time, until she brought the check that is! Honestly I will never go back.",1
"Ick, Ick, Ick is all I really need to say. We stopped here for a quick fastfood dinner before a show down the street and boy was that a mistake. The food was terrible and worse the cook didn't even bother wearing gloves.He just flipped the burger on the bun with his dirty hands and then handed us our food.",1
"Went after a dinner it's cool vibe wine bar with a dj. Dark , sexy and hip. It was industry night with local guest bartenders, I could care less as I don't drink . Krissy ordered a sparkling wine ordered a white from Spain I let her drink most of it the drinks are not overpriced, the music good. All in all cool place and would go again",2
The best restaurant in CG in my opinion. I have tried many of the dishes on the menu and they were all good. I have never been to a restaurant where I liked everything I tried until Feli's. In addition every time I'm there the owner comes around and asks how is everything which tells you they put a lot of care into the quality. This our family's favorite.,2
"Great bagel shop. Good variety of bagels and pastries, delicious iced tea and their vanilla hazelnut coffee is my favorite! The employees do a great job of keeping the line moving and getting your food quickly. No matter how busy they are, I've never spend more than 5 minutes in line, ordering and waiting for food. Check you mailers for coupons!",2
Love the ribs here. Gotta arrive early to put your name on the list. Expect to wait 30 60 minutes during meal times. Get player's card and print discount coupon. One coupon works for entire party. 14.99 for full rack 2 sides you can't find it anywhere else other than Ellis Island! Well worth the wait for good food and cheap gaming at Ellis Island. A must stop in Vegas!,2
"Just finished from the worst dining experience of my life. Service was terrible, the meal took over three hours from start to finish. The owner was not only unapologetic, but rude as well. The food was fair at best and not worth the hefty price at all! They should stick to the taco truck, and not try to be something they are not!",1
"Just about everything here is top notch. Grilled chicken sandwich is my favorite, but have amazing pasta dishes, salads, numerous tasty sandwiches hot and cold. Even the pizza is among my favorites in town. They have a small patio that is not very inviting, and the restaurant is very old and somewhat run down. That's the only reason that I didn't give five stars. Though it's old, it's clean.",2
Very nice Target. Love how they have a mini food court area and a Starbucks in it. Employees are nice and very helpful. Lines can be long though. Easy to find things in here and good clearance area for women's clothing. School supplies area is super big which I like a lot. Grocery area is pretty big which makes it easy to find thing in.,2
"Awsome! We were in the center orchestra 11 th row. All seats ate great, but these were amazing! He is a amazing singer but surprisingly he is a amazing entertainer! All tickets are the same price but if you stay at the encore or the Wynn you will get premium seats. During our show he brought out his wife Trisha Yearwood and they sang together! A must see in my books!",2
Easily one of the worst dining experiences I ever had. The waitress was pleasant but the food was terrible. I am a big guy and this is the first time in memory that I refused to eat ANYTHING on my plate. The steak was dry and tough. The rice tasted like store brand like Lipton. Beans gooey. All around mediocre food. Avoid this place.,1
I really enjoyed the breakfast. I had the short rib benedict and my friend had the green chili pork tostada with 2 eggs over easy on top. For the restaurant just being open for 2 days I thought all in all things were good. We sat at the bar and had very good service and the prices we very reasonable. I will be going back for breakfast at least once a week.,2
This is not the first time I been to this place. If you are successfully get a table and get served with food. You will probably rate a 5 stars for their food. For my experience I waited 20 mins in the line and got seated at the bar. SERIOUSLY DONT TAKE THE BAR we ended up waiting for 1 hour and leave without any food! We have talked to the server and he doesn't seem to be helpful whatsoever.,1
"Yep, I definitely agree with the rest of the reviews the clothes are priced too high unfortunately. All the staff is always in a bad mood or talking about each other to other customers. I don't know who took over but it is now crap and difficult to find something worth paying for. I mean come on, it is used items.",1
"This was the worst place ever. In my burger, there was some mystery meat that I bit. When I told the waiter she took my food back and not once did I get an apology. The service was horrible, it took an over an hour to get the food. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. I hope this place gets shut down. If you do go here dont expect good food or service.",1
"I decided to give Willalby's a second chance since Lazy Janes had a 30 minute wait for a table. Willalby's was even worse. We got in, ordered, and then we waited an hour for our food. How hard is it to make some eggs and potatoes? The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot to tell you we had a wait, "" but the place wasn't that busy. Anyway, the food was okay, but definitely not worth an hour wait.",1
Wouldn't know how the food is. Been here three times and each time there were massive lines while inside there were 50 75 empty tables and even more that were waiting to be cleaned. Management needs to stand out front and watch party after party see the line and walk out. Like most buffets the cashiers are fast but the seating takes forever while tables sit empty and customers leave.,1
I was visiting AZ from California yesterday and a colleague recommended this sushi place. It was terrible. The service was slow. I even told our waiter we were in a hurry and we still waited 40 minutes for one of the rolls only to find out the chef dropped the roll and had to remake it. Would not recommend.,1
"The restaurant was clean and the food was tasty. Selection was modest comparative to other Indian buffets. Service left much to be desired and there were as many workers as there were tables seated. Price was on the high side, again, in comparison 32 for two people. The two of us felt all but ignored until right before we left.",1
"If you're a true Asian, you'd want to stay away from this place. The food, and for the price, tastes low quality and without care. If you're into washed down asian flavor, you'll love this place. actually, it's not even washed down asian flavor, it's more doesn't taste like asian and doesn't taste like asis fusion. seriously, you'll find better places to eat than this place.",1
"The staff was very helpful and very friendly. I went for my first massage and they made the process easy and comfortable. This location is truly wonderful for customer service. My massage therapist was Corinne, who was absolutely wonderful. I really enjoyed my experience and plan to be returning soon.",2
"This place probably has the most Americanized Mexican food you can find. Bland, absolutely no flavor. I ordered the Mexican salad and it was tasteless. The chips and salsa were even bland and it's pretty hard to mess those up. I wont be returning anytime soon. I wish I could find an authentic Mexican place in Scottsdale but it seems to be a difficult task.",1
Love! Super awesome place to grab a quick meal and it's not super heavy or unhealthy like other places. Got the salmon salad and it was great for the price! Usually salmon dishes are at least 12 . All salads also come with a crostini and lots of different options for everyone. I will definitely be back.,2
"Food is always great, we enjoy their gyros and salads. You can add any kind of meat to the salad, their portions are good, the prices are fair. Everything is made when you order it which translates into fresh and warm food. We just found out their chicken is organic. Always a treat, the owner Steven is very friendly and takes good care of his costumers.",2
"Great Thai food here. Small place with limited seating but there is usually always an open table. They are heavy on the spice so beware. If you order Thai hot be prepared to sweat. Portion sizes are large enough to share between two ""non starving "" people. It's small and a little tucked away but definitely worth finding.",2
"I love this shopping area. There's lots of good stores here. Even an ABC store and a Hilo Hattie. If you're from Hawaii, you'll understand what I'm talking about. And even if you're a tourist to those same islands, you'll also relate. Regardless, this is a nice area to stroll around and do some good shopping.",2
"Love, Love, Love Starbucks and this one is so convenient to my work. I have to limit my habit because it is an expensive one at almost 5.50 a pop. They are always friendly at the drive through ""except "" for one person who works there. I don't think she i a morning person or something but other than her the rest are awesome.",2
"dennys was the best restaurant when I was a teenager. as you get older and have acquire a taste for real food and not a cafeteria joint. I stopped being a fan of dennys when I was 21. it became something I rather not eat and just starve. nI don't expect a lot from dennys, unless Im drunk and need food to sober up. I just think your better off hitting up a drive thru instead.",1
"Great Greek food! Calamari was fabulous! Brochettes couldn't be beat. Wonderful place for the kids as well. And the price was right being able to BYOB. Best of all, the service was out of this world! We were there on a very busy Saturday night and we couldn't have been treated better! Would go back in a second!",2
Tonight I had the double cheeseburger pizza it was awful. The pizza was so soggy that the toppings separated when I tried to pick up a piece. It had a nasty white sauce on it and nothing about it tasted like a cheeseburger. There was hardly any ground beef. This pizza's a joke. If I didn't get the half off deal I would have asked for my money back.,1
"The burgers are actually pretty good, which is the soul reason I gave two stars. The service is poor and not very friendly both at the bar and with the servers. No drink specials when we went in and they charge way too much for drinks. Charged me for crown royal when I ordered well. The food is this place's only redeeming quality and that's not nearly enough to bring us back.",1
"I am seriously so angry right now. They let my entire party in except for me because apparently the picture ""didn't look like me "" okay I'm sorry I lost weight and grew my bangs out! and they expect me to carry 2 ids on me?! Really?! Honestly don't come here unless you want to deal with annoying bouncers.",1
Tried it because of the reviews was not disappointed. You get to choose how you want it cooked and all of your toppings to. It's the real McCoy when it comes to the meat. Well seasoned and thick. The Demi glac u00e9 sauce for the poutine is also very tasty! A definite must try if you like burgers. Also the service was great.,2
"I had a pedicure with French tips and it was beautifully! I am going to have my legs waxed today and my daughter wants her nails painted. I will keep you posted as to my second experience, however, everyone was very pleasant with me during my first experience and there were several people in the salon that were obviously return customers.",2
"First time here. Burger was nothing special. As a matter of fact. I thought it was quite small for a ""customer "" burger place. nStaff periodically walked to tables asking if anyone needed refills. After sitting for 20 minutes. Nothing. Given the disappointing and ""flavorless "" hamburger and lack of attention to their customers, I this will be my first and last visit.",1
"Wow! Love how there are No menu .set course Meal.Food Is Great . Belly Dancers for entertainment. Great for First Date. Love the ambiance, BUT nMany Many years ago, they had Pillows all Around to sit on or lay back and was very Cozy Very relax, but now they have mini chair dont like . Over all Great Place!",2
"It's nice to find the things you love close to home! I went for the buffet and it was great! Everything they offered was to my liking except the hummus how can they mess up hummus, hmmm? I am a Baba Ganouj girl anyway and it was right on the money. The meat was a little on the dry side but tender and tasty. The deserts were great so I guess it was worth the 11.99. I will be back most certainly!",2
"I love hole in the wall taco joints . usually. Not so here. I got the shredded chicken and the carnitas tacos. Soft corn tortillas, of course. No flavor on either I guess they really rely on their salsa bar. The carnitas bordered on inedible due to the very hard crust on the meat. Might try this again someday just to try to see how it got so many 5 star reviews, but this trip was barely worth 2.",1
"The most disappointing Chinese take out I've had in a while. The spare ribs were fatty, the mu shu had a too strong flavor of star anise, the eggplant was very oily and not very spicy and the noodles were bland and had fatty pork. I really can't figure out why this place has a 4 star average? I'd rather eat at just about any Chinese restaurant in Chinatown.",1
Our party of four had lunch here on Thursday. I'm not sure how long they've been open but I just noticed this great addition to downtown Mesa a week ago. The lunch specials are very reasonable and the portions generous. The appetizer soup were a yummy surprise. The service was gracious without being too too. I'll definitely be back!,2
"Heard the hype, d u00e9cor was pretty cool. Contemporary and dark. I was sad to walk in and feel a little left out of what was a cool crowd and your not welcome vibe. Served a drink and waited about five minutes and after I asked for another round. I will go back and assume this is not their typical service. Fingers crossed for next time, especially since this is in my neighborhood.",1
"I always get great service every time I visit an apple store. I think they're the best. They fix my problem and send me on my way happy. Clean store, lots to look at and try. The only thing that could make it better would be a clearly defined person to check in with upon arrival. It's a little confusing on busier days.",2
"The Allison is under new management and has totally gone down the drain. Poor maintenance, too many dogs, trees that are falling down, paint peeling off the exterior of the bldg., a c not working properly. This bldg. is over 25 yrs old and is falling apart. Management is rude and does not address tenant's concerns.",1
"Me and my family will never eat here again. We used to love this place, but our last experience was just that, our last! We were sitting down and just ordered our food when I see something crawling on the chair next to me. Yep! It was a cockroach. I was so grossed out that I couldn't even wait for the waitress. We just got up and left and have not been back since. GROSS! Do not go here!",1
"Lovely little joint to stop in for a snack and a nightcap. Kevin made me a Godiva chocolate martini that rocked! Please try the pig and fig pizza. It's a fantastic and tasty treat. The service is friendly and accommodating. Can't understand why anyone would say otherwise unless they walked in with one of those entitled attitudes we see so much of today. Try it for yourself. All in all, delicious!",2
"I just love this place. Great atmosphere, great cocktails, and wonderful happy hour snacks. Very reasonable pricing too. Been to happy hour here a few times I had dinner here for the first time recently and was blown away. One of the best deals in Scottsdale and close to all the action of old town .",2
"I just got done eating here, and I gotta say if I can give it a zero I would. The food was over priced and under cooked. Not to mention I got to watch the manager at least I thought it was the manager hitting on the bartender for 45 freaking minutes while I was waiting on my salad. I will save you 150 dollars by saying do not eat here.",1
"My husband and I eat here at least once a week, sometimes even multiple days in a row. I love their chicken chimichanga smothered in the best green chile sauce ever! We have ordered almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed with any of it. Everything is delicious! Love, love, love this place!",2
"I love this place. I'm not sure if it's the solid selection of cigars, the patrons that you can chat with for hours, or the fact that Virgil is awesome, but it's my favorite place on Mill to hang out with friends. There's nothing better thaice weather, a patio, awesome new old friends, and a delicious cigar. My only wish is that they carried pipe tobacco since I'm a pipe smoker.",2
"Did not stay. Went to enjoy the show on property ""Recycled Percussion "". It's horrible from the parking lot and through. I don't even think we went through a casino, so that may have been in a different portion of the hotel. They've got some serious revamping needed. Needs cleaning. then polishing since you can't polish dirt.",1
"I paid for round trip, no problems, about 4 or 5 stops on our way to the hotel, I called as instructed 24 hrs in advanced and asked for a 8 30 pickup. The driver was there waiting on me at 8 20. We had 1 stop on the way to the airport. I will use them again on my next visit . Iwas really suprised this experience was that good after all the reviews I read saying how bad the shuttles in Vegas are.",2
"One word.Meh. This is a place to go if you really don't care how good the food is and you are dying for msg. I would call it cheap Chinese, but the word cheap is not entirely accurate. The food is moderately priced, and what we ordered lacked flavor and was rather plain. The plus side is they are fast and have a big selection of typical American Chinese favorites.",1
It's a mcdonalds. So many out there they everyone knows what to expect. Pros I liked this especially because it provided an inexpensive eating option while we were staying at the polo towers. They had a great deal of 2 Big Macs for 4.44. Located on the outside first floor of planet Hollywood. Co nDemographics that usually patronize this establishment.,2
This has to be one of my new favorite buffet's on the strip. I ended up getting the 24hour buffet pass which was 39.99. Planet Hollywood was the first buffet that we went to and we liked it so much we went back again. The line was minimal compared to my other favorite buffets Mandalay Bay and The Wynn . They do have crab legs for dinner but they are served cold. Worth the money!,2
Great beer list. They make the best old fashioned cocktails. You have to order one when you eat here. Fried cheese curds with garlic sauce is the perfect snack when you stop in for drinks. They are known for their burgers and rightfully so. I love the fried egg on it even if it can get messy. Their fries are not my favorite.nothing special.,2
"Dr. Pryor just preformed surgery on my son and I caot thank him enough. Never easy having your child go in for surgery, but Dr. Pryor's communication and professionalism left us at an ease. I caot thank him enough for being an amazing doctor! He answered all of our questions and listened and responded to all of our concerns. I would recommend him to anyone! Thank you Dr. Pryor!",2
"Bamboozled! Took my little guy to get groomed here yesterday and am still in shock over how bad of a job the groomers did! The haircut is completely uneven all over and I paid 40 for it! If you have a pet with any kind of length to its hair, then I recommend trying just about anywhere else. Not to mention that their pricing is way too high for what you end up getting.",1
"Purpose of visit Lunch with the boys after an all day atv trip in the dessert. We ordered all kinds of noodle soup. Spicy beef, shrimp, pork came out in these huge bowls piping hot. Devoured in minutes. Perfect place to take a break from the high powered prices of places on the strip. Came out to 20 a head. Can't beat it.",2
Stopped in today for a margarita and chips while waiting for an appointment had tasty green and fire roasted salsa and seasoned bean dip went well with my cocktail. I look forward to going back when the weather is cooler so I can sit on the outdoor patio. Will go back when I have time to eat a meal as I have heard nothing but good things from friends who live in the area.,2
I put it out on Twitter that I was in search of succulents a friend pointed me towards Campbell's. Everyone who worked there was extremely friendly even went into the back to get fresher moss than what they had out because I had mentioned I was using it for a photoshoot he wanted to give me the nicest looking moss he had. I will definitely come back when the weather gets warm enough to plant.,2
Was not impressed at all. nMy husband and I split the turkey burger and mac cheese burger. nThe turkey burger was cold but otherwise tasty. The mac cheese burger was not seasoned well and very bland. nService was horrible. Our waitress was in la la land. She explained the menu but took forever to take our order and re fill our waters. nWe will not return.,1
"Don't Buy from Allegro Medical. Three strikes they're out. Sold me a product not as advertised. Phoned and e mailed 3 times to get it returned. As of this date, no response! So my experience same as the other two reviewers. Incidentally, I gave them a bad review 7 5 2010 on their own system. Only 1 star. I bet you will not find it.",1
"we had the earl club and chipotle chicken club with a drink for 16 on a Saturday afternoon. convenient! rather than go to PH, just come here. no line n seating filled. we sat on a slot machine chair. n love the bread. I think this is what makes it really great! n NO TABASCO!? maybe PH is better. lol n Earl tea is really bitter. tea and lemonade. don't get it.",2
"Never again. SLOW, very, very slow. The clerk should have told us when we ordered that it would take almost 45 minutes for our order. Not in an airport! Pizza was OK, but nothing special even after the lengthy wait. I've had much better at other airports, but will most definitely skip the one in the Las Vegas airport in the future.",1
"I went to Pho Thanh a few times before because of Yelp's review but today I had a lunch here. I think I like Da Vang better, because of bigger parking, clean restaurant, more waiters working, cooler indoor and a little cheaper. I always order stir fried rice noodles with meat, shrimp and vegetables, more veges and I like it. I enjoyed very much and can't wait to have a lunch again.",2
"I out burger has ruined it for every other burger shop. So without comparing lobby to the other guys, this is a great burger. Slightly messy but really good. I had 2 and a side of fries. Price is decent at about 6 for a burger. Can't complain about that. Their sauce is really good too. French fries are seasoned just right.",2
"We had the best Tika Masala Chicken last night! I'm still in heaven. My mouth was doing some kind of dance that I had to continually eat for about 20 min. non stop. And those who know me know I love to talk and eat, but this time around it was all about eating and nothing else. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good Indian food ",2
"Food is okay, I am not a fan of self serving my own beans and salsa.yet the prices are very reasonable. Do not be in a hurry, the service is very slow and the waitress Hasmik is as slow as they come! We usually ask NOT to be strayed in her section. Overall for quick eats it's fine the food is fairly tasty. Perfect for nachos and beer after a movie.",1
"The upside of this place is that it is the only place open 24 hours in the Paris Casino and there's a large enough menu for everyone to find something that will generally fit their needs. Outside of that, prices are high and service slow for meh mainstream food so so burgers and fries, bland pizzas and salad. There's better options in Paris if they are open.",1
"We attended the first Friday in May, had never attended before The coffee was perfect! The chocolate cookie was the right texture with my coffee. When we attended we had the pleasure of listening to music by two wonderfully talented women. The area is beautiful, I had no idea that down town looked and felt like a small town. We loved it!",2
I cannot really explain how slow the service is. We were seated and waited about 10 mins till we went to the bar to get service. We then waited another 30 or so for food. Our drinks were never refilled. The whole time we watched about 5 hostesses sit around and and do nothing. Not worth 13 for a burgers.,1
"For 43 I got a basic manicure, a lip wax my underarms waxed. I got slightly rude stuck up service the place looked like crap. My nails weren't even dry before I got shuffled into literally a closet to get waxed. People kept coming in to get things while I have my shirt up showing everyone my bra. I don't ever plan on coming back here again.",1
"We wanted to try this place solely because of Gordon Ramsay's name. I had the farm burger and my girlfriend had the southern yard chicken . We also ordered the truffle fries. Overall, the food was good but nothing out of the ordinary. We've had better burgers at cheaper prices but it's worth a visit if you're ever in PH in Vegas.",2
"Wonderful atmosphere. Great service. Good food. not the best that I have had, yet pretty good. Not inexpensive. nGood menu selection. Calamari was outstanding. We ordered that as an extra dish as we all ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairings. The wines were interesting and I questioned the pairing of some of the wines to the dishes, yet otherwise it was good.",2
"went for dinner on sunday in april 2012. been going there since 1981. new owners a couple of times. this visit was not like the others. took so long to get our order. gave less food than before. ran out of the rice. food wasent up to par. think that was our last time eating there. very pricey. lots of greek fast food better than here, and much cheaper.",1
"Agreed Neal, this is one of the most pointless stores I have ever seen. It has barely anything, there are no tills so the queue is huge, and it is just about 300 metres down from one that has served all of Newington pretty well for quite a few years. Just another example of Tesco taking over the world.",1
"Closed for demolition. That's what the sign should say instead they are open for business. This is absolutely the worst hotel we've ever stayed in. Holes in floor and walls covered with duct tape. Mold on walls, mildew smelling rooms, dirty sheets and matresses, carpets filthy. Broken furniture, tub had Not been scrubbed in at least a year. Health dept needs to close place down.",1
"I don't really like Hooters' wings, but at 25 cents a pop, I'm not going to complain too much. However, it was rather unfortunate that the Hooters girls aren't actually there the same time as the wing deal. The wings were so greasy that my friend ended up puking back at the hotel from all the fat. But he's a wuss anyway ",1
"Just took a trip with desert adventure and they hit it out of the park! Friendly, helpful, and knowledgable staff that did everything possible to make our day safe and memorable, but most importantly. Fun! Beautiful scenery the entire time! Thanks again guys for making our trip the best possible! Don't think just book a trip and see for yourself!",2
"I think this will be the last time I come back and I've been eating here for 10 years. It's now 33 a person. For 150 for the four of us, I can find better places in Vegas for Sushi. It's good, but not great. when it was 20 a head, it was more ""appetizing "", now, not so much. Heck, the Bellagio Buffet is cheaper now and they have King Crab legs!",1
I guess I didn't think it lived up to its hype.maybe it's because some of the food just didn't taste like how everyone was describing it to taste. Some of the sushi was rather gross and I saw the line for the crab legs and almost cried. I'm actually going to give this buffet another try the next time I'm in Vegas since I don't remember anything special about it.,1
"I found this place today on accident, while taking a break from reading. Thank God. A cookie place that's open late? Fantastic. The macadamia nut was awesome and the double chocolate chunk was melty and gooey and delicious. Cookies are 1 each and the store is open until 2 30 am! I hear they also deliver. Wow. Nicely done, Illinois, Nicely done.",2
"Overpriced for what it is. a hot dog. Average chili, and a regular bun. These dogs would run you under 2 on a NY street cart and would be 100x's better. Good drunk food while walking around downtown and open 24 hours. Probably last time I'll go unless I'm desperate and craving an overpriced hot dog.",1
This was just like getting a beef sandwich at some of the places in Chicago. I went in about 5 minutes before closing. The staff was GREAT. They were welcoming and gave me no indication they were getting ready to lock the doors. My sandwich was excellent. Flavor and the Vienna Beef was a little slice thinly sliced of home. Go to Luke's. You won't be disappointed.,2
Based on other reviews I decided to give this shop a try for a pedicure. It was a wonderful experience. The staff is friendly and good at their jobs. We were greeted promptly and our chairs were ready to go. The entire shop is very clean. It was my sisters first pedicure and was a very nice experience for her.,2
"We have two doxies we take to Dr Stone. She is very kind and thorough. We never have had to wait to see her and the waiting room and exam rooms are always clean. We are often surprised at how reasonable the visits are, expecting it to be more. We and our dogs are very happy with Craig Road Animal Hospital.",2
"The first time I went to Ground Control, the service wasn't the best, the baristas sp weren't very welcoming and the breakfast food wasn't very good either. I decided to give it another chance, and l have no future plans to go back. Stay far away from the chicken salad as we found an unwelcome visitor mixed in with ours. So unless you like to eat bug sandwiches I'd steer clear from this place.",1
"The service is decent, but the food leaves a lot to be desired. You can get a better burger, with exactly what you want on it, for a little less money at Fuddruckers a half mile west of here. You won't have a server to bring your burger and have to apply your own toppings, but that's a better setup in my opinion plus there is nobody to tip!",1
"Been here a few times now and have enjoyed myself each time. They rotate art out monthly and this time around was skateboard deck art from local artists. Even bought one! Very affordable place to purchase localy made art for your place. Don't forget they have cold drinks and hot ones, too. You can pair your drinks with a baked good as well. Check it out.",2
Horrible. An hour and a half after I dropped off the car they hadn't even moved the car from its parking spot and all I needed was an oil change. It's now 2.5 hours later and I'm still waiting for my oil change while the techs stand around in the shop. Time is money and these people wasted my time lost my business.,1
"Awesome place for a premium burger, beer and fries! Black and blue burger medium rare is must. Classic bar and grill layout. The server was incredible friendly and competent. Chatted with the owner and his daughter who manages the place. Both are very relaxed, funny and nice. Mr ""Dotty "" was a bit of a character. Great locatioear the campus. Definitely a keeper on the Madison short list.",2
"This place sucks! No one will help you. Each time I've actually needed help or had a question, the employees make you feel as if it is the biggest inconvenience to speak to them or God forbid help you. On the rare occasion someone does help you, the short manager tells them to do another task. Customer service is sooooo lacking here.",1
Food was okay but Leslie the server is horrible! I was standing behind her for 10 mins while she talks to another customer. No one else was at the bar to help. I had to call the bar to get someone and another bartender came and she said that Leslie will help me get my food. Really? I've been standing there for awhile and did not even acknowledge me? Bad customer service!,1
"Don't go to this place! For what I paid, I was expecting more variety of meat and other stuff on the buffet. We went on a Saturday afternoon and I though it would be packed, but it was empty. If you want a real Japanese yakiniku, go to YAGYU. For what I paid at Sura, I would be able to eat much better quality food at YAGYU. Don't waste your money in this place!",1
Amazing is a great name for this place because that's what it is! nSo stoked to have another raw vegan option in the city of Pittsburgh. nThe menu changes often but I've never been let down. There are always delicious options to be had. nJuices and smoothies are great too! nGreat place to stuff your face and feel good about it. ,2
"My girlfriend and I almost go to this place weekly. They know our regular order now by my phone area code. We've never had a bad meal, and the food quality puts to shame every other gyro place we've tried here. If you go in and they have a bunch of baklava's sitting there grab one because they are fresh and delicious!",2
This place is always my fav. For the you can't beat the selection and quality. While the Wynn Cosmo have higher quality foods this place has the best variety of good tasting food. The Asian food and pizza is the best. The dessert selection isn't great but the gelato is. I'm not a dessert person so I don't mind. If you love dessert Wicked Spoon is the place to be.,2
Great park. Visiting phx for the day daughter wanted out of car. This was the perfect stop to stretch legs get a little sun bf heading back to tucson. Wish we had something like this near us. Also noticed fantastic fenced dog park. There is a 2 5 year old playscape a 5 12 year old part. Love love love it.,2
"Came here for the happy hour. We ordered the crispy calamari, spicy tuna roll, and crispy sesame rice. The food was delicious, and the service was good. They messed up on one of our drink orders but quickly fixed the issue and even comped it for us! The feel of the restaurant was very elegant as well. Overall a good restaurant!",2
"food is good, but check your order. I ordered cactus chilli and broccoli cheese soup, and I got 2 broccoli cheese soups. nalso ordered a salad and only got spoons in my bag and no pita. I rated it so low because when I pay 20 something bucks for take out I expect it to be right. to late to drive back up.",1
"I've stayed at the Mandalay Bay several times and I havent been dissappointed yet. The rooms are above average and the options for food and entertainment are excellent. You can eat high end Aureole or low brow Nathans Hot Dogs go to the beach or see Cirque de Soliel Michael Jacksons One or just gamble all night and day. If you cant find something to do here, you just dont know how to have fun!",2
"Been to old location too and the food is good but just not worth the wait. Waited for over an hour for our food, no one came to refill drinks, said something to owner but she didnt do much and spent time telling us why we had to wait so long. Food was cold and they need to hire more staff, buysboys, waiter, ect.",1
"I do not like this target. The team members are unhelpful in helping you find the item that you are looking for. They stand there saying UM we don't carry it, several minuts later I found the Item after the team member flat out lied. After look for my self I found the item. Lazy team member in house wares. TARGET nEXPECT LESS, PAY MORE!",1
"Best buffet in Vegas that I've had. The selection and quality of the food here is simply incredible. The thick sliced bacon was the best bacon I've ever had and the dessert selection is pretty good. I like The M dessert selection better than Wicked Spoon but The M is located off the strip , but the gelato bar is still great. Would recommend this buffet to anyone!",2
"No better place in C U for a gyros. This place has always been a favorite of mine. I'm so glad they came back after the fire, better than ever. I especially like that they offer a small size of their gyros sandwich. They have excellent fries as well. Service is always fast and friendly. Keep up the good work!",2
"I went in to order some take out and won't be back. Nobody greeted me. When I read the small sign that said to order at the register in the back, I stood there for three minutes while two members of the staff awkwardly looked at each other neither of them even acknowledging me. I will not be back. Service and staff don't know what customer service is.",1
"This would be a great place except for one thing, everything is in french. Now this is great if you are looking for french manga, but in Montreal you'd think they could have some english manga, among their collection of 3000 books. So if you're looking for english manga, there is absolutly none to be had here, just book shelves and book shelves of dissapointment.",1
"Not to say that I'm a Mexican food expert, but I am from San Diego and have had more tacos than burgers. That being said, I am a big fan of Filibertos and it is on our weekly rotation of restaurants that we frequent. Great food, friendly service and they are open early and stay open late. What's not to love?",2
Made a trip over here for ice cream they closed an hour earlier than posted on Yelp didn't even bother to change the signage to reflect the new hours just stuck a piece of paper over it. They closed right as I arrived and the lady just shook her head and walked away. Huge FAIL! If you are going to change your hours change them online first so people don't waste the trip!,1
"A rude owner and a litter bug marketing lady do not make for a good restaurant. Plus, they seem to be a little homophobic and they don't open on Sundays, because of some stupid reason. The food is not very good either. I can go to Trader Joe's or Costco and buy chicken breasts and make a better chicken sandwich than Chick fil A ever thought about making. Fried food is bad food.",1
"There is the ""sit down, get served "" kine, and there is the ""lunch stand "" kine. I just went to the lunch stand part. I went to the very back to get my quarter pound of spicy avocado poke, then I went to the register to order musubi. In the future I will go to the sushi bar area and check that out. Otherwise, I love it I love it I love it. Broke da mouf, fo' sho'!",2
"i have really high hope for this place, but 2day my experience is somehow very disappointed. i ordered the tacos and the pork came out to be so chewy! i dont know whats going on and the sauce is bland. i may going back again just because this place seem to be popular and yelp give them high score but i dont know. maybe 2day is just not my day.",1
"Honn u00eatement je ne m'attendais pas u00e0 grand chose. Pourtant lorsque je suis arriv u00e9 sur place, le service u00e9tais plus qu'impeccable du d u00e9but u00e0 la fin. Le vin et le risotto que nous avions command u00e9 u00e9tait ph u00e9nom u00e9nal. Probablement le meilleur risotto que j'ai mang u00e9 u00e0 vie! Je vous le recommande absolument!",2
"The good clean place, nice linen table cloth, you can sit where you are out near the crowds walking by, waiters are quite attentitive and friendly. The bad the food was only edible. There were two of us and neither of us liked what we had although we were able to eat some of it. Would never eat here again.",1
"Stop here usually after going to the St. Jacob's market. As noted elsewhere, fast food is fast food, but the manager and staff make you take notice with their service. Very good, exceptional for this type of place. Especially since it's always busy there when we go. Great at the counter, and the manager comes around sometimes and asks how things are. Really unexpected.",2
"Very cool staff. Nice facility. Easy to find. I should have called ahead to see what guns were available because I really wanted a M 16, AK, or MP5. You have to choose from what is on the rental shelf.not the awesome hardware around the store. If you are a novice, no worries.they walk you through everything.",2
I have 2 young toddlers and eating lunch here was very difficult. Not enough high chairs and staff and other customers seemed inpatient with my children. nFood was so so nothing to rave about. The biggest wow was the yummy cinnamon roll! Next time I'll be getting it to go and just the cinnamon roll.,1
"This is one of the best, cheap buffets in Vegas. I like Main Street Station because I used to stay here as a kid. I recently went back to eat and was happy that it was still good. I love the Hawaiian section, my first picks were Kalua Pig and Chicken Long Rice. I was happy they had local favorites! Then I went for the Pizza, yum! It's a nice, clean place, with a lot of variety!",2
"Absolutely disgusting! We paid 100 bucks to stay in this place, it's not even worth 5 bucks. The comforter was covered in cigarette burns. There was nasty hair stuck all over the toilet paper holder and the towels that once were white are like a stained yellowish brown. My boyfriend and i slept fully clothed and didn't even chance laying our heads on the pillow. STAY AWAY!",1
"I wasn't sure what to order so I ordered one of my favorite side dishes. Mac and cheese. I was extremely disappointed it was very dry and bland. It cost almost 4 bucks im really glad I didn't get more i really was hoping that it was good. The portion was a good amount , just lacking taste and cheese.",1
"Definitely the dive bar to go to in Vegas. Bartenders are friendly, drinks are cheap, and the food next door is pretty great! Low pressure, wasn't loud. Just make sure to order a water from the tap. Otherwise you are paying 2 for 8oz of water! Not touristy at all, not worth leaving the strip for, but if you end up around it, for sure worth the stop. If I moved to Vegas it would be my local dive.",2
"We LOVE Lin's, effin A Lin's. This is, by far, the best Chinese buffet in Phoenix. We look forward to going to Lin's and will go multiple times a week. We are offended by the negative blasphemous comments. If you have a negative view of Lin's, you don't know Lin's. Clearly. We love Lins. I could say it all day. We will be requesting tshirts next time we go. Haters not welcome.",2
"We've been here a few times now. An eclectic variety of dishes with a unique twist on each. An American fusion of cuisines that they make their own, ranging from pizzas to grilled meats and fish. Haven't had a bad meal yet! Good stuff. And on your birthday they'll credit you 10 towards whatever you want on the menu.",2
The food is always delicious. Basic Mexican fare baked burritos and enchiladas. The bean dip is amaze balls. We come back for the food but the service is always sub par. We eat here every 2 weeks and we either get the super slow non existent server or mr no personality that brings me an empty Tapatio bottle and insists they don't have Chalula even though I've had it there every other time.,2
Service was decent. Waitress was miserable but attentive. The food was pretty bad though. I ordered a regular cheese burger which came out super fast. I would say not having a long wait was a good thing if I didn't believe they microwaved my burger upong request. Definitely not up to par with chili's which isn't that good in the first place.,1
"Food average. Pink Taco dish was decent, greasy like a TJ Taco Truck, also small in size, but with the slow service, drinks, rice and beans you'll likely be ready to move onto the pool Service below average, slow like watching paint dry nDrinks below average. We had to send back a bloody mary or two because she tasted funny. And the shots of Brandy to fix my cold, of course , took forever!",1
"It may not look like much from the outside, but the inside is nice. The food is great and the staff are friendly. Their pad thai is incredible which is an understatement . The Khao Soi is also very good. To top it off, its hard to beat the price. My only hesitation is that I have not eaten at too many thai restaurants and so maybe there is something better out there.",2
"I have become a regular here recently. I have not met cooler business owners, especially ones who will go out of their way for customers. If that wasn't enough, the food is great! Water boiled bagels and amazing variations. Plus, this is the only place I can get vegetarian kimchi in a huge jar and or on my bagel. Enjoy.",2
"It's ridiculous to call a number for a county facility like this and the phone number doesn't work properly! You can call the number but you can't get through to anyone because when you press the numbers when prompted for a department, nothing happens. You have to call police non emergency. This listing is a complete waste unless you plan to go to this office directly!",1
DO NOT JOIN THIS CLUB. DO NOT SIGN A CONTRACT. I moved out of state and cancelled my membership. I sent in my proof and they never got back in touch on this issue. I went to sign back up when I came back and they said I never sent in my material. Now they want 330 and a cancellation fee and put it on my credit. I even wanted to sign back up. They are SHADY.,1
"This chain was crap in Los Angeles, and they are crap here in Nevada. So Much for 2nd chances. Good luck trying to get out of there without them trying to push some other cost onto the bill. They recently came up in the news in a sting operation where they were over charging customers for services not request etc. Stay away from this place.",1
"This bar is pretty chill. They have an alright beer selection. Even serve PBR which is important to some! It stays pretty chill. Mostly regulars. The o have an internet jukebox which helps make any place little better. Most of the music that was played was rock, punk, and metal. Nice. The worst part was there weren't many hot guys or girls to look at! ",2
"Tony s. Is correct. Cobblestone has young, pushy sales people that don't know how to treat a customer. Their price for a wash is high and they do a poor job. nThe only nice thing i can say is that i had my windows tinted there and it turned out great. The price was fair too. Hmmmm.any coincidence that the only good service there was operated by a gentleman over the age of 25?",1
"Loved this hotel! I absolutely would stay here again. What I liked It's small, so easy to get around in this hotel. Compared to some of the others which were massive and easily get lost in lol n Good customer service n Check in and check out was easy n Room was nice, clean and spacious n Close to everything not as central as say, the Bellagio.but it was pretty close n Free evening shows",2
"The burgers were AMAZING! Everything about them was great. The meat, buns, and toppings were what you want in a burger. The burger was cooked perfectly and was so juicy. The service was really good. I was impressed. The only thing I would change are the fries. I didn't think they matched up in excellence to the burger. that's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars Other than that.YUMMY!",2
far better Mexican food in the valley. The place was dead so I don't really know how to rate the service. the food was like Chili's and the prices were like an upscale Mexican restaurant . I think the people coming from a day at the pool or a great concert must put them in the mood to review this place better? Go to Viva Mercados and forget Pink Taco.,1
"These hot dogs are good, but they are always late setting up. This is the second time I have been here with the same problem, I arrived at 7 p.m nobody was outside in the parking lot. I came back at 7 38 they are barely setting up said that it'll be 15 minutes more until they will be ready. Something they reaaaaaally have to work on.",1
"You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. I haven't had a bad dish here. Phyllo packets, fez salad, fez burger, kisras, all melt in your mouth. If you like real garlic e humus, give it a try. It's awesome! Oh, all the martinis are just great too. Candice is the best sever there just in case you care. They never disappoint!",2
"I had the Fully Loaded special today for lunch and wasn't impressed at all, the pulled pork had no flavor, the mac and cheese was average and the sharp cheddar overpowered the entire sandwich. I gave it a try like I wanted to but I won't be back, for 9 I could have had something better from Food Truck Fridays.",1
"Absolutely horrible place! Snakes was treated like pieces of shit, and we WILL NOT stand for it! The manager is a complete asshole and doesnt give a shit if you have a good time or not, as long as he gets his money. Completely unprofessional and neither myself, or any of my friends will ever set foot in this hell hole of a place ever again.",1
"Love the Chop Shop and am so glad they opened up in Tempe. I now have a location one block from my work in Scottsdale and one block from my loft in Tempe. Nothing beats the Tri tip, shrimp, or tofu protein plate and a power green juice for lunch. Also, my friend swears by their grinder. Check this place out ASAP!",2
"Horrible! The food was far from good. I was so disgusted with what they served us. Everything looked like it had been sitting out for hours. We had a 70 tab, which we could've had a better meal at Wendy's. I mean EVERYTHING we ordered was awful. Potato skins, sliders, the Reuben, and even the kids hot dog and chickeuggets were not edible. This place needs Gordon Ramsey to save it. DO NOT GO HERE!",1
"The service at this location is always excellent. The staff is practically falling all over themselves to be helpful. If I wait for something more than a minute, I get profuse apologies. We used their safety deposit box service which worked very well for us, and was always very easy to access. ATMs are well maintained.",2
"My favorite yogurt shop so far. Friendly staff. Great selection in flavors low fat, nonfat, NSA, lactose free . Fun toppings chucks of pop tarts, pink white animal cookies They have my favorite tart banana flavor. Banana tastes like taffy taffy banana. Lychee is the craziest. 0.45 an ounce plus they have a reward cards. The places loud with orange duh and green colors.",2
I love this place! I can't say enough good things about it. My son takes karate classes here and we love Mr. Ben because he is firm but in a loving way. The great thing about it is if you miss a class they keep track and you can make it up at another time slot that works for you. If you get a chance check out a free trial class and I'm sure you're child will love it as much as ours does.,2
"The perfect place, if you're looking to eat like a rabbit! nI came here for the first time today for lunch to meet up with a coworker. The quality of the food was good, the workers were friendly, and the place was clean. BUT the amount of chicken on my salad was maybe 2ozs at most! I went back to the office still hungry and ate a pack of tuna for some protein.",1
"4 stars for the food itself. though surprisingly small portions. It was very tasty tho. make sure to use the 'hot' sauce provided on the tables, very good alongside the arepas. 5 STARS for the Soursop drink. I had never ever heard of it beforehand and it was so delicious that I may just go back to this place just for that drink specifically.",2
Follow Up post Spoke to the manager about the subpar hostess and she has offered us free dessert for the terrible service .Management is very receptive and understood my issue. I increased my original review to 2 stars due to the professionalism of management and the delicious dessert that followed. I will not go back but hopefully they will have better service in the future.,1
"This place is absolutely terrible. I ordered the hot and sour soup, it wasn't hot OR sour. Tasted like oil and was just terrible. The egg rolls had pretty much no filling. Even after I took off most of whatever they're wrapped in, I still couldn't taste the cabbage filling on the inside. The rest of their food is just greasy and makes me nauseous. TERRIBLE! I would never suggest eating here. EVER",1
"Deceptive business practices, so beware. They dramatize the difficulty of the job to convince you the flat rate fee is reasonable. Then the actual work is done in short order and you are left paying an enormous hourly rate. Other than what i believe are unfair billing practices, the balance of the work, scheduling, etc. are fine.",1
"My husband and I just arrived. We haven't even received our food and already feel uncomfortable. The chef is 10 ft away talking negative about our order. Just because we don't eat eggs unless they are hard boiled. ""Who eats hard boiled eggs? "" he says. Obviously us. I love waffle house but I won't be back to this location. notip",1
I have been going here for a while now and can't say anything bad about it. The staff are always friendly and knowledgeable. There aren't too many times when I have to wait very long to get my hair cut. I have seen many stylists here and haven't had any bad experiences. Very affordable as far as I am concerned.,2
"Wow. Moved here from San Diego and have been looking for a good taco shop since. FOUND IT. HUGE burritos. Fresh tasting food and its CLEAN! Great salsa bar with carrots, grilled peppers and hot to mild salsas friendly staff and taco shop prices. Love this place. Definitely worth a try.I recommend the surf n turf burrito.",2
"This gym is rediculous! I was spoiled before moving to Arizona and had a gym membership in a super sport. They had the most up to date equipment and had classes at all hours. This gym has machines that are always falling apart and their group x classes are directed toward house wives that don't have daytime jobs, unless you want to do Zumba or yoga!",1
"What a wonderful little korean grocery store. So glad I found it. The prices are good, love the little gift section, restaurant is so so, and selection is not bad. Took off a star because both times I went there, they ran out of economy size kimchi. Wtf? Not acceptable for a korean grocery store. Would be like a pizzeria not offering small or medium pizzas.",2
After eating here feb 11th I got extremely sick I have Diarrhea and headaches calling them to help the problem they are rude accusing me of lying saying that me being sick isn't there fault it was the only place I ate and I was the only one to eat the dish I ate. They are rude and don't care nthey are not worth getting sick over period,1
"I called to make an appt, but was greeted with a message to leave your name number we will get back to you in 2 business days. That should've clued me in. I called again the following week, nobody got back to me. When I went on the Internet, it turns out they closed abruptly nov 8, it says some patients were informed of the closing, I sure was not informed. Unprofessional.",1
Mamma Mia.what a mallisimo experience.complete armpit smelly horse throw up. We were starving and believed this place would satisfy my hunger. I ended up paying almost 20 for a two egg omelet that included scraps of bacon. The customer service was even worse as I had to ask for water every single time I ran out. Horrible place inside the MGM.never breathing their air again.,1
I love jimmy johns! Way better than other fast sandwich restaurants. Just had a bad experience though. I always order the Italiaight club with hot peppers on the side. This location though the cashier refused to give my peppers on the side! Is it that hard to put some peppers into a cup? I don't think that's too much to ask for.,1
Those who like shopping at Best Buy won't have any issues here. The employees are helpful without being pushy. There is a lot of parking so it's just a matter of how close you'll be to the store. The men's restroom was clean. There are other stores but plan to do quite a bit of walking if you want to visit a lot of them.,2
"I live right next door to this Trader Joe's so I feel pretty lucky. The best time to go is usually Sunday around 8am, otherwise you have to fight the traffic from the greenway. This place is cheap and has fun items to buy for special occassons and daily meals. I almost always find what I'm looking for. I do wish they had fresh rotisserie chicken, but you can't always get what you want!",2
It had been a while since I had been to Blu. My last visit was less than anticipated and frankly I was disappointed. However.last night I decided to give it another shot.and I am glad I did! The waitress made awesome suggestions and Richard.the original owner chef took the time to talk with us. Our food was fresh and delicious. We will definetly be back!.,2
"Ann is great. She is extremely knowledgeable and is 100 focused on customer service. She takes the time to walk you through the process and ensures that you are kept in the loop 100 . She goes above and beyond to ensure that her clients are satisfied, and that's hard to find these days. I would recommend Ann Adams to anyone who is looking to buy, sell or rent a home.",2
"I randomly swung by this spot before work just trying to grab something to bite with some coffee before running into work. Best choice I've made all week. Not only did they have blueberry donuts something I haven't seen since leaving California but they also had Thai tea! Very nice folks in there too, they can expect to see me more often.",2
We love to come here everytime we are in Vegas. My favorite entree are the tacos. I love the spices they use. Plus I like the decor and open air vibe and lighting. They play a mix of music as well. I tried the shrimp ceviche appetizer this time which was just ok. The top shelf margaritas are yummy. nI did come for Sunday brunch once and I do recommend it. They have mariachis during the brunch.,2
"Certain things just come with Vegas hotels chaotic casino noise and decor, milking you for every possible dime, drunks grabbing your ass in the elevator. However, they're not all as blatantly rude and indifferent. Be prepared to shell out for slow valet parking, a bellman's ""assistance "" and a resort fee ha! . Clean enough but worn around the edges. Spend the money and stay on the Strip!",1
"This is worst nail salon in Las Vegas. The salon have old old people doing nails that is so outdated and very ugly. The owner Rose do not know how to do nails, wax, pedicure, or eyelashes extention. There is another old lady named Cammy that everybody should stay away! They are so mean and unprofessional. I will never come back here or recommended anybody to come here.",1
"Overpriced sushi and appetizers, most rolls you could get at another restaurant for a third of the priceas here and it would be just as good. The wait staff was a bit OCD about keeping our table neat and orderly. They came by half a dozen times to straighten plates, pick up straw and chopsticks wrappers, wipe drippies off the table, and etc.They were nice though. Lychee martini was good tho!",1
"The recent change in rental companies has been for the worse! The ConAm management is a joke. What happened to the other company? Smfh! There is ALWAYS something wrong with this complex. The garage door has been broken for nearly four months. The elevator is a hit or miss. One day it's broken, the next day it's still broken.",1
I feel like butter on a warm spring afternoon. Almost melted. I have always loved his hot stone massage but this time I needed more attention on my neck and shoulders so I went with his aroma touch Swedish massage and could not be happier! Jesse is amazing and I feel better than I have felt in months!,2
The food was great! The buns are amazing there cant stop at one! The ribs were really good and my husband enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich! We check in using the Yelp app and got a free cactus blossom! Who doesn't love a free appetizer. Overall our experience was great! Definitely would come again and would recommend!,2
"I enjoy this place regularly. Food is always excellent. The staff is attentive and very pleasant to chat with. The lunch buffet is 9 and has many selections that are all delicious. I've tried many dishes and they are all awesome. Vindaloo, masala, chicken korma. Garlic naan. Love them. Glad I found this place!",2
I have been a fan of this place for about 4 years. I finally got my husband to eat here and he is hooked! We both love the pad Thai which is super yummy. I also really like the Yellow curry with sticky rice. If you enjoy spicy foods this is your place cause they don't mess around when it comes to spicy!,2
"The owners are super friendly informative. If you're unsure of the items on the menu, they would show tell you exactly what is in each of the food options. Don't be scared to ask! Food is delicious! I would definitely recommend if you're looking for something different than the typical American food.",2
"Great place for a slice that is unlike anything you'll get elsewhere. I'm from Chicago and we have Ian's there as well, so I knew what I was getting into when I stopped in here for a slice. Just wild toppings and a great place. Although I didn't go to UW I'm sure the college kids are fond of it too after hitting up the bars. Ahhh, the good ol days of bar hopping at a Big Ten institution.",2
"This place rocks. Great location, plenty of parking available, awesome service. LOTS of beer options and wine on tap. The staff is educated on the huge beer selection, and very friendly. I don't think I've ever waited longer than 10 minutes for my food. Tuesday night TV dinner is awesome, creative, and the quality is good.",2
"Really filling. Got the burger and was super satisfied. The beer battered burgers was overkill. Super tasty, super heavy. Decent price for what I got. Really filling. Got the burger and was super satisfied. The beer battered burgers was overkill. Super tasty, super heavy. Decent price for what I got.",2
"The waiting room is very nice. Air conditioned. Free water, free coffee. It was very welcoming and the staff was very by nice too. The only problem is that it was a little pricey. Battery cost 125, where it is half the price at Costco. But based on their service and professionalism, I would come back. nThey also give discounts if you mention yelp!",2
I truly love this place. I work in the area and I frequent it often. It is great for lunch. Love the Chicke Avocado sandwich. And it is convenient for happy hour. The TV's are nice and viewable. I typically am always seated at the bar. n Casey has to be my favorite bartender. She is so cute! All of them are good though. Never have to wait for a drink.,2
"Our absolute favorite sushi spot in Vegas! Yummy food, great service, amazing price and some of the best sushi rolls I've ever had! Great price for AYCE eat sushi! Fish I always fresh! My favorites are wet dream roll, 21, Harry potter roll, firecracker and garlic tuna sushi! The yakotori is yummy and my husband loves the seafood salad! They always remembered us and service was always great!",2
"Um. who knew the best dessert I'd ever have was two cookies and a scoop of ice cream?!?! It was AMAZING. You get to choose your ice cream and then your cookies everything from chocolate and chocolate chip to peanut butter, snickerdoodle, m ms and more. They were soooo delish i can't wait to go back to Tempe for another one! if you're anywhere near the area you MUST go!",2
I love love love this place! I've been to Thailand and I love the food here very good and very close to the true flavors you would find in the homeland! Highly recommended and always packed! They offer daily specials and happy hour specials. I eat here every time I'm in Las Vegas. I can't get enough of this wonderful restaurant! nXrxy! Delicious! nMarshana,2
The manager Laurie and associate Ferguson were the most helpful staff I've dealt with in any supplement store. I had a few dozen questions all of which were answered in detail. They had a lot of patience with me and helped me locate products they did not have in store. Price matching also was not a problem at all. I will def be going back regularly.,2
"First time, nCupcakes are deliciously bad. I ate 2 and i think my taste buds were going into a shock. I actually had to take a breather from eating. When in doubt just as someone behind the counter what they would recommend super friendly and really helpful. Truthfully this is a once in a week treat. I wouldn't go there more then that.",2
Rhondalyn is the best hair stylist! My hair is natural and fine and it was so hard to find a stylist that could take care of my hair and also style it. She has been doing my hair for over a year and I couldn't imagine going to anyone else. My hair is healthy and easily maintained. I can't say enough good things.,2
I was disappointed w my whole experience. The server was never to be found. I ordered a drink from a bus boy. I was there from 830 1041pm. The amount of time that passed between each course was ridiculous. The beautiful cut of sea bass I ordered was over salted cold. The ribeye my sister ordered was about 3 4 inch thick. I would choose any other steak house in Pittsburgh over Eddie Merlots again.,1
"Absolutely the worst choice for our first meal in Vegas. This place is completely overpriced and the staff was inattentive. Miguel seemed annoyed we didn't want to order right away, but chose to enjoy an appetizer first. The sushi is about the same as the local convenience store. I would rate it zero stars.",1
"Bleh it was free with room and I also got comped so got to enjoy 3 buffets each lucky me ugh They serve the same food for lunch and dinner daily for 20 each I would have been really mad if I had to pay for it. There were a couple of good things mashed potatoes and gravy was yummy, chinese noodles and a good salad choice.",1
Close to 4 hours for an alignment when I was told 2. Also had a reservation on saturday that they said it would be done in 2 hours. They didnt get it done on saturday either. Wasted 3 hours of my time then. I have tried out a few auto repair places in Fountain Hills. Worst by far. Don't come here. No problem for saving you time. Car finally done then it comes back with dirt all over the door.,1
Update to my last review. Shortly after I wrote my review I was contacted by Eric an owner of the company. He was very apologetic and refunded my cab fare. Obviously he is concerned about their customer service. He assured me that the cab was fixed immediately and the drivers were advised to not let that happen again. I will definitely give this cab service a try in the future. Thank you Eric!,2
I have only been here for sushi and the food and the value are great especially during their happy hour specials and lunch specials. There are lots of sushi choices in and around Chandler but this one is the best all around value. Some may have slightly better food but not much better and you can't beat the specials.,2
"The wife and I have been to CCC three times, and each time it has been friendly, clean and efficient. The food is always of good quality and I've enjoyed each item we've had. I'm not a big breakfast guy, die to the fact I know I can make it at home far cheaper and just as good as most places, but will gladly patronize CCC on occasion! Definitely recommend!",2
"I have been a Verizon customer for many years and this is the worst service I have ever received. I expect the prices to be higher in a Verizon corporate store than Costco, Best Buy, etc which they are . However, I also expect the quality of the service and the knowledge of the products to be higher as well which it is not .",1
"After seeing the size of the parking lot, I was pleasantly surprised with this little gem! We were immediately greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff. The ""man "" salad was wonderful! The ingredients were all fresh and the tuna was delicious! The prices are great for the quality of ingredients and the portion size. The sandwiches looked awesome! I will definitely return!",2
We have eaten there many times and I love the service Linda you have to be in New York frame of mind. Give it back to her to make her smile! The food is always better than expected. It has become a great comforter zone. Try the pasta with eggplant. . penne amalfitana. Fabulous. Pizza is good as well.,2
"Just moved here from Baltimore and ran across this place. Love it! Watch yourself at the hot bar. There's no scale should be . Your mea l of veggies, tofu and kale could end up costing 20 easily. I usually grab a hot meal and play on my computer 1 2 hours. Love the carrott juice with ginger YUM! A small is 4.30 ouch! Just found out they won't charge you for bags if you bring your own.COOL!",2
"I could say, the service and food can be fixed, someone has to care. The bits of chicken in the chicken teriyaki aren't going to make someone go back, the vegetables look and taste old, noodles are bland. The cashier looks like he doesn't wanna be there, and last time I was there, the cook had over 15 plates to make. Poor guy. I gave it a second chance and it really disappointed.",1
"An absolute embarrassment to the company. Cheap little franchisee uses the smallest wings he can find and then sends out coupons for this crap. If you like wings, go to another store and get the good ones. Most NNY stores are good and serve quality. This one DOES NOT. If they'll cut corners on their wings, what else are they doing that you CAN'T see?",1
"I do love this place. good grub, great atmosphere and they have a Seattle Seahawk's following! This is a place I use to go to with co workers where we could use the wifi and work late afternoons while enjoying a Harp. Now, that my job has changed, we go for Seahawk games or anytime we're in the area. Always delivers a good pour.",2
"I love this bar! The set up with all the lounges is excellent. It is amazing how spacious this bar is! They have a good beer selection, surprisingly they have Killians on tap, it is rare any bar has Killians on tap. The service is awesome, everyone is very nice. Lindsey Erica are the best! If you like a laid back bar with friendly people this bar is for you.",2
"It's about what you should expect for an old, run down hotel. It's badly ieed of an update. The rooms are very sparsely appointed with basically zero amenities. No wi if, no decent TV, leaky plumbing and lots of noise. The food is typical Hooters fare, just more expensive and the service is pretty poor. The gaming machines are cheap and blackjack is only 3, so that's one plus.",1
"I would rated minus 5 if i could, stay away from this place specially this persoamed Kimberly she is awful she chopped my hair off way far from what i've asked to at the end there was no haircut and she told me ""the less you wash your hair, the better it will look "" i needed it dirty! I SHOULD'VE CUT MY HAIR AT HOME CAUSE THIS PLACE AIN'T WORTH IT!",1
"Nice room but staff is in different and or not friendly not rude though . I will play elsewhere. Girl behind poker counter seemed like she didn't want to be there. Dealers no too friendly either. Plenty of places to play that appreciate your business. Poker room is moving to strip side of casino, but to bad there customer service is staying!",1
"I saw all of the great reviews and decided to give it a try, very glad I did! I used to go to a place down the street and my nails would look good but recently my gel manicure would chip after a couple of days. I came here and was sat right away and out of there in 20 minutes after my French tip gel polish. It was also 5 cheaper than my old place and they look great!",2
"Dropped in with my expired Groupon. Basically used my Groupon as a credit which they were happy to do. Got waxed and must say was one if the best waxing experiences ever, great job and she took her time will definitely use her from now on. Then pedicure. Awesome pedicure. The while experience felt relaxing, not rushed at all.",2
"Saw the Guy Fieri's show. went to chandler location. worst food I ever had. barely warm greasy fried chicken, jerk chicken tough and greasy. shredded beef was so over salted I gagged! presentation looked like a plate of garbage. We sent back the teriyaki chicken as it was undercooked! rice was under seasoned ,cold and oily. nothing tasted fresh.shame on them.",1
"A great selection of drinks to choose from. Sadly the lacklustre and disinterested staff let it all down. Shopping here should be exciting and adventurous no matter the level of your drinks knowledge. You can excuse a bad 'one off' experience, unfortunately there is a pattern. Please remember your customers.",1
"Ya I really like this place. It's like a rotisseries where the waiters bring rods of meat to you every 2 minutes and all kinds of meats too like sirloin, chicken, turkey, etc . The food here is really good and the service is good. I like it. It's a meat lover's delight! My only complaint is the selection of drinks here. It's a bit limited.",2
"Not impressed. My car was sent through the car was with one of the windows partially down. The interior does not seem too wet, but one of my seats was soaked. I was expecting a manager or someone to address the issue, but was never approached. The customer service is lacking at this location. This is the second shoddy experience I have had and will not return.",1
"We visit every Harley Store in any city we visit. nThis by far is HUGE. The sales racks are plenty. but in the gist of all Harleys. everything IS expensive. Having a Harley is accepting the price range of all accessories ""needed "" and not so needed. The displays are pretty awesome and the staff helped us out with questions we had. It was a fun visit.",2
"One of the few places in town to get a NORMAL breakfast on a weekday! I used to frequent the place but my office location moved too far away, but when I did, I loved it. The coffee is great, and the meals are definitely above par. The current location is a bit noisy for meetings, etc. which is my only gripe.",2
"No longer impressed with this place. The wait staff knows nothing about wine. We asked if they served different wines in different glasses and were told that only older wines are served in larger glasses so that they can air out. Really? Also, they no longer serve flights. Lame. The wine is very tasty but it's always nice to have knowledgeable staff.",1
Had lunch here today. Food was good. Server wasn't. Placed order for our food. Got most of it. Asked our server for the last thing we ordered and responded with if I made sure it went through. I don't work there! You do. Totally forgot about our food and when it did arrive wasn't even hungry anymore. 2 star for the food drinks we did have. Going to go elsewhere next time we are in town.,1
"The last two times I bought from here were great deals. I as most usually buy used books from Amazon.com. However, two classes required me to buy new textbooks for test or online materials. nRebelbooks offered them only 12 more than Amazon.com prices. Plus, I didn't have to pay for shipping or additional online sales tax to Amazon.com.",2
"The ""manager "" of this post office Cat Phan is extremely rude and degrades customers in front of the whole lobby! Not to mention the long wait just to talk to someone! He refused to refund a guaranteed next day priority mail express that took two days to get 4 hours away. I paid 18 for next day and it took as long as normal delivery! He needs to be fired!",1
Stopped here for breakfast. Seated very quickly and food came out quickly. The breakfast was as tasty as always. The only thiing I didn't like was how the server had her thumb all in the food as she passed me my plate. That totally turned me off. And she overcharged us and we had to have our bill corrected. 2.5 stars.,1
For what it is it's expensive. Not that it's not good. Just over price. Not to mention there is a KFC right down the street. The place is clean and it's a great location to have a chicken place. The service is what you would expect from a fast food. Also I think the portion size could be a little bigger once again overpriced . So with out being more repetitive I'm done.,1
Avoid like the plague! You know things aren't off to a good start when the attendant utters only monosyllables like he's hung over. They refused to acknowledge our reservation and insisted we had to make a new reservation at a much higher rate. We took our business elsewhere. What a lousy way to start our vacation.,1
"This place really is as good as the rumors you've heard. The quality of food is exceptional. You don't have to gorge to get your money's worth but you end up doing that just to get a taste of everything. From ceviche to Korean short ribs, you won't be disappointed. Of course you end it with dessert and the brilliant gelato bar. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.",2
"Came here for a burger, got the salad on the side. Asked for oil and vinegar for dressing. Waitress said 'oil and vinegar' was the first such request. So she brought me malt vinegar and cooking oil. Yikes. Even Subway can get you oil and vinegar without messing it up. Service was a bit slow. Burger was OK.",1
"Waited over 35 mins from the time we ordered our drinks until they brought them to us. Granted it was busy, but that's inexcusable for the amount you pay here. The waitress was really nice and apologetic but seemed as if she was helpless to fix the situation. The food is actually really good. If they lowered their prices by 20 their prices would be more in line with the quality.",1
"My fianc u00e9e and I used to come here a lot and the food was good. Must be the gas prices cause the quality and portions have suffered. n5 small strips of steak for fajitas is SAD. Maybe I ordered from the seniors menu. Oh well it looks like I will be stopping by taco bell to fill up. nMy opinion save yourself the trouble and eat at Taco Bell, at least the value for your money is better.",1
Pizza is great but service is crap. waited 10 15 min with 4 ppl in front of me to order a slice! of pizza then another 10 15 to get it. then u have to go search for water and napkins in the food park. not to mention trying to find a place to sit and eat the 7 yes 7 dollar slice of just peperoni pizza. no common sense is practiced here.,1
"Walked in around 4pm and an employee walked in right behind me and immediately asked if she could help me. Took my order and told me the pizza would be ready in 15 minutes or less. 13 minutes later had my pizza and was heading home. Excellent service, I will be returning when I want another thin and crispy pizza.",2
"After several hours in the casino, we arrived at Noodles, drinks in hands. Without question, we were seated and got to keep our drinks what a plus . It was a perfect spot for lunch if you don't want to leave your amazing hotel. A spicy dish is the perfect pick me up to take you to dinner. I cannot wait to go back.",2
"The chips and bean dip were delicious! Almost at the very same moment we finished a basket, our waiter would pop out and give us a new one. He must have been hiding behind a planter and watching us or something. It was great, albeit a little creepy. As for the actual meal, I was so full of flour and refried beans that I only took a few bites and boxed the rest up.",2
"Food Great. Beer Great. Service Absolutely Terrible. Ryan M was our server and everything was a challenge, drink refills happened finally as checks came along, took 15 minutes to get credit card processed, and never even offered desert. It is a shame that such a good restaurant had such terrible service.",1
"I went here a lot of time with quite a few different people and we all loved it! The service is quick and the BBQ was GOOD! Definitely try the mac n cheese on the side or the green been casserole. The small pig is enough food for one, but if you're really hungry go to the big pig. It's also a great hang out spot for young professionals after work dinner time.",2
"I was upset that I spent 50 for a gel nail color and regular spa pedicure. But the gel nail color has lasted me over a month! Extremely good quality! I've never been more satisfied with a gel manicure. nUnfortunately, I wish the pedicure was as good as the pedicure. Kind of wee nAk and pushy, still pretty good though! Would definitely go back if i am ever back in town!",2
For a sandwich shop with a limited selection they really bring their A game. I cant remember the name of my sandwich but it was a hot sandwich with schredded chicken and all of the extra goodies on top with a special sauce. It was quite delicious .so if I were you and in the area of this shop I'd definately go check it out small but good ,2
Spent a bit of time at this restaurant enjoying both the food and the atmosphere. I loved the authentic servers dresswear. I'm not very original in my Thai food choices but because I tend to order Pad Thai most always I can say this was one if the best. I did expand my culinary endeavors a bit with my choice of drink which was delicious!,2
"This is where I go to get all my comics. I've actually been going here every wednesday since i moved to Las Vegas. The guys who run the shop are very knowledgeable. Also, if they ever run out of a book, they call their other locations to see if they have it. If they do, they send it to this store so I don't have to drive around town. Great place to get you comic book fix!",2
Called them up and ask them if they had a product. The associate on the phone was helpful and I told him I would be there in 20 minutes to pick up the item. When I arrived I told the owner what I was looking for and he said knowing that I had called that it would be in stock 5 days later. I told him that I had just called and that he said it was in stock and he just shrugged his shoulders WTF!,1
"I'll be honest, we went here for my sisters birthday. The millers in Town Square I loved so I said great things about this one upon arrival. Let me just say I will never EAT here again. The food was horrible. The service? Great, our server was awesome. If I wanted to go drinking and watch sports I might come here. Other then that.I won't be here again.",1
"This place has quickly become my go to suite hotel to stay in while I'm in Vegas. nGet the corner suite if you can, the view is awesome. in room keurig is a nice touch. Keep in mind there's no casino here. Strictly rooms, suites and a few bars. The walk to Aria, Crystals and Bellagio is close enough to walk to quickly. Will return for SEMA CES.",2
"Come on close this Place or make Good Food. Burgers are spoooo tiny i mean tiny. Mc donalds tiny Size i mean, Same quality but you Pay 6 for it. nFries ok nothing Special. I m picky with my Food but this Place Sucks. If you are hungry Skip this Place. I forgot the awfull Desserts. Even they are . Come on!",1
"Just moved back to Vegas from NYC and gotta say Oscars is hands down the best barber shop from the East coast to the West coast! Had my hair cut by Oscar n he did an amazing job! I don't have to be too specific to get the exact haircut I want and it comes out perfect every time! One suggestion to anyone going, make an appointment! Its always packed and for a good reason too!",2
"i used to shop there all the time. not so much anymore. his prices have gone sky high. much higher than inflation in other stores. that can't be good for business. now when i go to food city, which has the best prices on produce, it's crowded with asians. i wonder if they've stopped going to lee lee's too.",1
"Don't get me wrong. I like loud music. Having gone to more live rock concerts than just about anyone. But today at this place, the music was so loud the employee's could not hear each other. I told the guy at the register, ""the music is a little loud isn't it "". He just stared at me and did not lower the music. Othe people came in and walked out. This place has gone down hill.",1
"I've used this service every time I have stayed at the MGM Grand and have always had a great experience. Of course they charge for computer time, but no more than any other Casino! You can also print Boarding Passes for free. The computers are setup perfectly for a wheelchair user. Even so, the Staff has always offered to help if needed.",2
"An amazing meal, hands down. I was there with a small group and not a soul went unsatisfied. We drank a fantastic Bordeaux that coupled well with the lamb and kobe beef, but the dish that earned everyone's envy was the lobster pot pie. Simply incredible. This is definitely on the procey side, but if you are like me and go to vegas for the shows and food read no gambling this place is a must try.",2
"My wife told me to download the Hotels Tonight app, which gave us a coupon for a hotel stay. We chose LVH. We didn't expect much, but we were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were decent and the bathroom was a nice size. It wasn't huge, but not as small as some places we've stayed either. It's worth checking out if you want a quick getaway.",2
"This place is amazing. It is a hidden restaurant right in uptown Charlotte. The food is amazing. The drinks are amazing, especially the beer selection. It is also a very good place for date night, bro night, or just night. It is so good. D Parking is on the street and it is only for two hours without permit. Just FYI. D",2
"Liqidation sale! Items were marked up more then befor the sale. Tvs are being sold for more then Best Buy reg price. be diligent and check prices. This sale is not great at all. Bought a small lamp but when got home it would not work! Called they can ""t exchange it. got screwed out of 126.98! AMERICAN TV. I will not miss you!",1
"Hostesses seemed bothered we interrupted their conversation to find a table same reaction several times. we were staying next door on business . Other than that, really enjoyed the service. Servers were always friendly, and the food was consistently good. Tried the short rib burrito, carne asada burrito, Chipotle shrimp, street corn. Enjoyed all of the above. Would come back.",2
My husband and I came here on our Vegas getaway back in October. We had just finished eating at firefly and noticed the hookah bar sign and thought it would be a fun to try it out. My husband and I are not smokers at all so the employees there were very helpful with our little hookah adventure educating us when we had no idea how it worked!,2
This place sucked. The people seemed to be mostly older. Age 35 and up. The younger ones were mostly ugly and or fat. The had a dance floor and a DJ. The music choice sucked. It was rap and country. It was almost to get service since I wasn't a regular. I would not bring friends here unless they were old or ugly.,1
It was good. The service wasn't very good though. The only problem was the price. 50 for an 8oz steak. I realize this type of restaurant wasn't conceived as an all you can eat American slop house but 50 for and 8oz steak? And the veggies were extra. I spent over a hundred dollars on a mediocre dinner and was still hungry. The vodkas good though.,1
Absolutely love this place food is awesome staff is great and we will continue to come back here! A little added bonus for our visit today is that were enjoying our breakfast in the rain and our waiter Christian has a awesome personality and was verry respectful to my family! Keep up the good work guys!,2
"Definitley a nice spot for locals. I'm from San Diego, and stopped by after a recommendation by a friend and boy was he right. It's a great place to catch MMA or boxing. Great eateries and excellent selection of slots and tables. I would love to come back, if they comped me as well as the hotels on the strip.",2
"I just spent a very lovely weekend at this hotel. MY ONLY COMPLAINT is that they don't have a fitted sheet on the mattress and the comforter was too small. Other than that.it was great The pool and hot tub were really nice too. The staff were excellent. There is a hair dryer provided, which I liked always saves room in the suit case. The soaps and shampoos were good.",2
"Beautiful scenery and course. Short and fun to play. We stayed at the Golden Nugget and took a car service up. Had trouble getting the service company to come back and get us! One of the locals in the gated community brought us back. The locals and staff were a treat, even if you shanked one into their yard.",2
Took a friends huge truck in to get cleaned as a thank you for letting me borrow it. You would have thought I was driving a Bentley instead of an old work truck. I bought the full service 21 wash and I think it is the cleanest this truck has been since it came off the new car lot. I will definitely be back with my car. Best service I have had anywhere.,2
"I am so happy I found this place. The atmosphere is so relaxing and there is such great energy here. Not to mention, the BEST treatment I've ever gotten. I have fibromyalgia pain and this is the only thing that really helps. Mayo is so calm and energetic at the same time. She totally understands how to help you. I can't say enough great things about this place. I'm so glad I found it.",2
We had a party of 6 and enjoyed free breadsticks as we were first time guests. Our service was friendly and attentive. The lasagna and Fruiti De Mare were both amazing and the children's portions were large! The only thing that keeps me from 5 stars was the wine selection. I would like to see a better selection to accommodate the wonderful food.,2
"If you're looking for great food, dining in an un rushed and comfortable atmosphere and owners that truly care about your experience, it's hard to beat Sushi San. Not only are the rolls marvelous and their sashimi divine, but they also have a host of appetizers and side dishes that will knock your socks off. Love this place.",2
"Wow, I cannot see what all the hype is about. They totally screwed up my order. Apparently you need to learn another language to f n order here. When I asked for ""meat, cheese bread "" I've been informed that I should have asked for ""Dry "". WTH is up with that? Totally NOT impressed! Won't be back! Too pissed off.",1
"Needed a dry cleaner to clean a couple of comforters, a white one with stains and a darker one covered in fur. Saw this dry cleaner on Yelp with really good reviews so decided to give them a try. They got it done in a few days and came back clean and looking like they never been used. Stain free free of pet hair. I would definitely come back again for their services.",2
"The food is great, definitely a different take with regards to pizza. Flavor wise I think the pizza here is tops compared to other pizza places. Sicilian Pizza is made of thick dough and is a specialty called Difara. Difara is a must try just to make a comparison againt's other pizzas. We tried the meatballs lollipop style and really tasted great. Will be going there again to try the pastas",2
"Went there for lunch with the kids. Everything was delicious but found the total higher than I was hoping for. I mean I've had great mexican food for quite a bit less! I guess this is a nice place for a special dinner, thus the higher price tag. Service was great the server was helpful. The trio of salsa and chips was fresh and yummy! I got the chicken fajitas and mmmm good stuff!",2
pooooor service uff01 the taste is not right uff01not the traditional Yunnan Noodle uff0cwaste of money. they should change their name to Pho uff01 uff01 uff01never seen Yunnaoodle like this uff01 uff01the spicy noodle does not come with meat uff1f uff1f uff1fOMG uff01 u gotta be kidding me uff01 really doubt if the chef ever been to Yunan uff01 uff01,1
"So we didn't exactly search this place out on Yelp and select it based on reviews we went because of its proximity to our office at PVM. We had takeout, with dishes ranging from the fish to a pasta to a steak sandwich. All were decent, but none were spectacular. I'd order again for takeout when working late, but wouldn't come here as a hangout after work or on the weekend.",1
"I heard someone describe it as ""Pussycat Dolls meet Pirates of the Caribbean "".that's pretty dang accurate. We missed the show several time on two trips due to rain and wind cancellations. After seeing it, I now know we didn't miss much. But hey.it's free, so there is that. if you are close at show time, watch it, but certainly, don't make a special trip to see it.",1
"I left my iPhone here and one of the guys there stole it literally! I went there to collect and they denied it, i sat there from noon till 4pm till that person who served my table arrived and after too much struggle he accepted and gave me my phone. He was lucky I did not hand him to the cops. Never ever go there again, totally untrusted staff.",1
"Came in late at night because my 2.5 year old son was vomiting every 20 25 minutes. The check in process is slow. However, everything besides that was AWESOME! Great nurse and amazing peditrician! I'd mention them by name, but I was a little pre occupied cleaning up vomit They took excellent care of us, very personable bedside manner and my toddler really liked them. ",2
This place was sooo busy that I thought they would do an awesome job! After waiting for an hour I has pretty bad service done. All I got was a pedicure and it was not worth the money I paid at all. The only good thing is that it is open 24 7. If I can find another nail shop open 24 7 I will def. be looking into their services!,1
"As I walked in to place my order I noticed gnats flying around the register OK GROSS! I should've walked out then , the woman that took my order was very rude sighing, rolling eyes, etc , my order was wrong and I was charged for something I did not receive. If you really want to try Samurai Sam's I would NOT try this location.",1
"Close to where I live and the food is nothing but delicious. Only the second time here but nothing like tamales to warm your stomach on a cold evening! Service is fast, food comes out hot and the service seems to be pretty fast. It's kinda like a hole in the wall Mexican joint that serves a purpose. Decor is everywhere but good to watch games at and relax.",2
"I have been here for dinner with my husband. We order the 2 wine, one appetizer, one steak, and one scallop. real like scallop, must try! But the steak, it's not my favorite. We also order the one pudding, and warm chocolate cake. Price around 130. I feel the price is a little bit high, but the view is gorgeous, you can saw the bellagio water fountain.",2
I've not had any treatments before this. I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome. First treatment Juvederm and Botox. With the Juvederm the results were instant. Botox a few days later. I was very happy with the results. Why plastic surgery when to me this works quicker with no down time?I will definitely recommend Charles to my friends and clients.,2
The cashier asked me if I wanted my receipt for my credit card purchase. Duh! Yeah! Went there last night and ordered a take out X Large MegaMeat. Got home and it was on thick crust which I didn't order or like. The pizza was super dry with minimal sauce and cheese. It was awful. Oh how I wish RoundTable Pizza was in Mesa.,1
"On our second visit to e we got the drinks pairing since we had so regretted not getting it the last time. I'm writing this update to suggest that unless you're a big drinker, don't do the drinks pairing. We were wasted for our last 2 dishes and basically needed a nap after dinner. Still, everything else about the meal was perfection. e can do no wrong.",2
"I frequent this location the most since it is closest to my house. There's always great text deals and usually they're pretty fast. The shakes are really filling but hey if you're down with that go for it after 8pm they're half price! The other great thing? Breakfast ALL DAY. I'm in love with their burritos, and every so often I get the text for all day 99 cent breakfast burritos. Awesome!",2
"once upon a time nthere was a french bakery nopen all the time. Wow Charlotte, you are amazing. An amazing bakery, coffee shop, French open 24 7. This is a grad student dream. This is a macaroon lover dream. This is a coffee drinker insomniac paradise. Seriously. Go here. Eat here. Study here. Sleep here. Be happy.",2
"Best New Organic Mexican Restaurant in Vegas! Food is amazing! Service is amazing! Finding a delicious organic restaurant in Vegas is actually quite a hard thing to do, so I am so very glad that this place opened! There's not much else to say other than EAT HERE! You will definitely not regret it! And, oh, you're welcome! ",2
"I have always enjoyed the food at Mimi's Cafe, but this Mimi's in particular is so dirty. It seems like they never clean the decorations on the wall. I happened to touch the back of a booth one time and my hand had gross, greasy accumulated dust dirt. I let the waitress know and she said they only clean what the manager says to clean. This place could use a good deep scrubbing from top to bottom.",1
"Great food, it's better than Thai Basil located right up the street. The tempura is awesome. The clear glass noodle soup is great. The imperial veggies are killer. The only thing that sucks is their sub par spring rolls which are greasy cold like they were sitting around for a while. Highly recommended for fellow vegetarians. Go there stoned wash down that cottonmouth with a Thai iced tea.",2
"Poor service Dirty tables and they waited until after my order was in for 20 minutes to tell me they didn't have the item I ordered. I have to request a menu to order something else and then they told me there would be a wait because their kitchen was backed up. The food I did order was not very good, very inconsistent.",1
"Terrible follow up. nBy mistake I left my camera in the driver door pocket of the car when I turned it in. I realized this during my flight and called this Enterprise location immediately upon landing. The response ""We are not staffed sufficiently to check the car for your camera "". Someone at Enterprise now has a new camera mine.",1
HORRIBLE HOSPITAL! nChecked my mother in for a cough via Emergency room. DR wanted to keep her overnight and staff told us a room was available. SEVEN HOURS LATER they took her up to a room.finally ER stopped waiting on someone to transport her and took her up to the room on her own.THE WORST SERVICE IMAGINABLE FOR A A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER!,1
"This is the most epic swap meet I have ever been to, you can just about buy anything there you can even buy a house last time I was there . It's cheap to get in, sunday are a little crazy and there is a line. But where else are you going to get to drink a ice cold tecate on tap from a cup that says ""BEER "" on it and hold a spider monkey?",2
"My wife loves this store I think she goes weekly because the selection is outstanding and so is the owner. She consistently finds new fiction for herself like ""Cutting for Stone, "" which the owner recommended, and books for me like my recent acquisition from the store's history section ""Medieval Warefare. "" Medieval Warfare?! Awesome!",2
Big fan of AZ Auto Air. They will be my go to auto A C company from now on and the place to refer all my friends. Mark the owner and his mechanic were great! Very reasonable pricing and they went above and beyond with my needs. They were also very friendly and personable. From talking to the owner you can tell he is very honest and smart. I wish many prosperous years to come for this shop.,2
"Whenever I'm up for a game of pool, Clicks is only a short drive away. There is always a table available and a tasty inexpensive draft beer to be had. The staff is always attentive, and the specials are worth showing up for. Even the food is okay after a few drinks. 6 25 11 Drove by clicks the other day and it is now closed.",2
"From the exterior, the place doesn't look bad. The olive oil and basalmic vinegar that they gave was a nice touch. But the food was only subpar. The chicken given in the dish was very tough, and the noodles were cardboardish. The saving grace was that this place was pretty inexpensive, but you get what you pay for.",1
"This place is amazing! They have fresh made food and huge portions. Their bread is some of the best I've ever had. My husband and I have been to Kneaders twice now, this location and the one in Yuma and it does not disappoint! We split the turkey, bacon and avacado on foccaccia bread because it's so much food. Their sweet breads are phenomenal as well. We will definitely return!",2
"Horrible experience! Got there at 1 am and the front desk worker wasn't there. The lights were turned off so I called with the after hours phone. After 10 minutes, someone let us in and we stood at the counter and he finally walked up, then told us we couldn't check in for an hour because the computer was down. Finally got to our room 2 hours later! Horrible experience!",1
"For an Embassy Suites this is lackluster. The lobby is ncie and the breakfast is really good. The room was old, the fridge did not work well room 1030 , and the area around the hotel is apparently very dangerous, s be careful if venturing out. You had ot pay for WiFi, I hate being nickled and dimed. Throw it in, geez.",1
First time here so busy and so good and yummy. nThe owner is super nice and friendly. I love their sandwiches.I really felt like I was eating healthy and it was very flavorful. No more junk eating for me lol. I will be back for the quiche since they had run out. Come check this place out . Lots of seating outside.,2
Awesome! One of the best meals we've had. Great fresh intense sw flavors. Lobster tacos awesome. Shrimp w tamale awesome. Coffee rubbed filet amazing. Chile relleno very good not over the top but vg. Twice baked pot and roasted corn sides were good not amazing but good. Great service cool atmosphere. Margaritas and mojitos were great too. We be back!,2
"We had dinner there last night with the Groupon. Appetizer paneer cheese tikka this was OK. nEntrees The black cod was cooked perfectly and the lamb curry was delicious. nDessert poached pear our waiter recommend it to us, totally amazing! Supposedly the waiter thought my friend looked like his brother. He was pretty funny and gave HONEST recommendations. Don't ever get the Indian ice cream.",2
Waited 50 minutes after I called the order in before it was ready. Two pizzas were over 50. When we got it home one pizza was barely warm and the other had ingredients which we specifically asked to be left off. But the real problem was that the Chicago style pizza was inedible because the dough inside was raw.,1
"This place is just not very good at all. The place is incredibly loud for one. It's a nightmare for me being deaf in one ear. I can't hear a thing in there, and I've tried sitting in three separate places in the restaurant. The portions are really small, the pasta is really big and doughy, and in three meals I have yet to be impressed.",1
"Salsa had no heat, not even the hot one. food was flavorless and over cooked. Service was horrendous. Nothing to say good things about. Vegetable fajita had no seasoning and tasted canned and greasy. Fish fajitas also lacked seasoning and fish was cut into small pieces and treated as though thawed. Guacamole tasted store bought. Would not recommend",1
"I would have gave them a NEGATIVE stars if they had them. Continuos horrible service, rude and all we ever get is a ""I am sorry "" from the manager. We keep coming back hoping for a change. But it never changes. We will NOT be coming back here. We will take our money to cocos which is across the street IHOP is officially on my ""most horrible restaurants "" DONT GO HERE, safe your money and time.",1
"Totally dig this place! Had the Bombay taco which I would give a solid 5 stars, the carne asada another 5 stars, and the shanghai which wasnt for me but I would still give it a 3 star rating. Had a HUGE beer menu and tequila menu, its a whole page written in the tiniest font thats how many they have. They even have a beer pairing menu to go with your tacos. It's great, go there and eat for sure.",2
Working at a call center we always tried different restaurants I. The area just to stop getting the same things over and over. Their food is always cooked fresh and they make their own sauces that are to die for. Everything I've tried from this place was super delicious and I recommend this place to everyone.,2
Almost the best donuts in the valley. Get em while they are fresh and they are amazing. The plain sugar donut is by far the best on the menu. Simple but perfect. Also a plus that they are open all night. I have even sampled their breakfast sandwiches and their croissants are flaky goodness. Can't go wrong with Bosa ,2
"Horrible service, horrible food. Bad experience. So basic! The decor is nice which is why they get the one star but the waiter was rude. The food tasted horrible! The beef taco carbon or whatever was horrible don't get it. The pancho nachos suck. The only good thing is the salsa and the creamy jalape u00f1o.",1
"it's all about the WOW factor when they bring you a huge plate of food. quality was lacking, we thought we'd rather go to dennys next time. the coffee was from the bottom of the barrel both time, nothing flavored available. should i really have to get up and ask for a spoon, butter, creamer, splenda because our waiter andrew was terrible. and no toilet paper in the loo? REALLY? once is enough.",1
"This place is huge. It's a bar street level and a night club upstairs, 5 cover . The music was mainly rock, hard rock, electro rock et hip hop when I was there. The smoking areas outside have heaters, which is perfect during the cold winter days. The drinks are cheap. The people there are mainly in their early 20's.",2
"I only give this place 4 stars because my favorite doctor is no longer here. We've been clients for 15 years. We usually drive to see her for the big stuff but for emergencies and routine nail trims we stay close to home. Staff is friendly, facilities are clean and it looks like they just remodeled again.",2
"This place is absolutely great. Short walk from our hotel, friendly staff, wide variety of brands from all around, plenty of space and time to browse. Husband and I realized we shared a love of pens paper in a way we hadn't discovered before. We both walked out purchases we love. Highly recommended.",2
Lunch here yesterday. Service was terrible and my friend was served her lunch without utensils. She asked for utensils and the waitress left and did not return. I got up and asked the hostess and she gave me attitude. I didn't get what I ordered but ate it anyway. The food was good. The fly buzzing our table was not. I'll never go here again. Bad service.,1
Don't go here. Seriously. The wait is bad enough already. Their ramen is one of the few foods that leaves me thinking about it and dreaming about it after a visit. The flavors are complex but complimentary and an excellent value. Biggest changes that would up the rating are a a bigger space and b more attentive personalized service. Don't go there.,2
This is NOT a Japanese restaurant. We did the 20 buck all you can eat sushi thing which was a tragic decision. The sushi rice is TERRIBLE. But the crab roll appetizer was really good. My theory is that if you stick to Chinese food you'll be okay. Our waiter was French and snooty. I thought he was funny. ,1
"I admit I'm usually the 1st to try to go cheap on repairs.NO MORE! nVince treated me like a Queen, the waiting room and bathrooms are photo worthy and it didn't cost much more than the non dealer shops all the way in Central Phoenix that couldn't get to my car for 4 5 days. Did I mention my air conditioner stopped working and it's 111 degrees outside? Thanks Chapman! Give Vince a raise.",2
"Dr. Holmes is the most knowledgeable rabbit vet! He is great at what he does and really cares. He works with local rescues which truly shows how much he cares about helping animals! Last year I had an emergency with my rabbit, and even though he was booked, he somehow managed to squeeze us in. Wouldn't go any place else!",2
"Out of the way, gay lesbian bar pub. Locals know this place well. They have friendly staff, good selection of booze, and free condoms in the toilets all places should do that nowadays! . If you're looking to get away from the usual thing, this might be the place. More on the middle to older crowd, and not a teenie bopping place.",2
"Nom Nom Nom. The food here is so delicious! My personal favorite is the fried green tomato sandwich and next would be the carol. Of course my all time favorite is no longer on the menu, i am told if requested wheot slammed, if all ingredients are there, they will make that too! Goodness I love this place. If you haven't eaten here, what are you waiting for?",2
My girlfriends and I wanted to get a quick drink before capping off the night and saw this place near our hotel elevators. Very convenient and cool locatioear the right back end of the casino area. Our drinks were delicious and prepared perfectly. This bar is right across of the restaurant red 8. Very nice upscale decor and great location to people watch as well.,2
"A M A Z I N G. Amazingly expensive too, but well worth it! nEverything is exquisite. Really, I could write forever, going through every single dish we had, but it's a waste of my time. There was NOTHING bad here. If you can afford it , this is one of my highest recommendations of a restaurant anywhere in the world.",2
"I wish I can put this with no stars, most of the food was disgusting, not only this, the lady on the cashier was so rude, the only good thing was the server she was smiling all the time and came to our table several time to check if we need anything, I paid 82 for two persons but honestly, i shouldn't paid 5 for this",1
Have been here two times after stopping at Mancini's Bakery. Have only had the Hamburger Cheese Bacon w fries but huge portions and great price. Great Quality also. Server is really nice also. Will be eating here again. Heard the Breakfast items are also great. Saw the waffles and pancakes.were huge!,2
Just wanted a large diet coke on my way home. But no one would answer the drive thru at 10 54pm. I decided to pull up to the window and saw am employee climbing in the window from the outside. Still wanting my diet coke I pulled up to the window and all of the employees scattered and hid from me. Um. so I left without my diet coke.,1
"Worst customer service I've ever received. If a kid drops their ice cream cone after you just paid 20, as a business owner, you should give the kid a new cone instead of making the kid pay another 1.50 because that family comes enough to make up for the 1.50, but we won't be back. I hope that charge of 1.50 was worth it for your business.",1
Ugh. Got the Italian Night Club to go. Asked for the mayo and dressing on the side. Was told they are not able to do that. They have no Dixie cups. Really? They finally found something to put it in. Shouldn't have bothered anyway. Was just oil n vinegar. Made my own dressing at home. Bun was a glorified hot dog bun. Smh.,1
Had to try the pizza to see how close to real NY it is after our disappointing visit at Sirricos. This will be a must on every visit. Excellent flavor and hopefully will stay this way as long as health conscious do gooders don't ruin it looking for healthy pizza as they have done at Sirricos forcing them to change to low and no fat cheese. Eat salad and not pizza if you want healthful pizza.,2
"Given the chance and the ability to lose weight with a wish , I could grab a pastry here every other day. Although I've never had their cakes, you can't lose with a pumpkin empaneda or a red beef tamale. On the tamales, they don't wrap them in papers anymore and these things are huge! It could be a meal in itself and they are tasty.",2
"The manager interviewing potential employees has no class! Watch out because if u don't know your rights, he will abuse his power! Asking women if they have kids? Asking women if they are single? Do you plan to have more children? No? I have heard that answer before! Who the hell do u think u are? You must have mommy issues mr manager!",1
This is the place that first started serving fried Oreos and Twinkies in Las Vegas. This is also the place that has scantily clad women in front handing out beads. This is a slot machine only type of casino that we walked in and out of because it smelled of the same skanky oil it smelled like when I was last here about 3.5 years ago.,1
"Wow, what a disappointment and I'm a huge bobby flay fan. Menu is ""tired "". Service was good. Wine was great. Food just seemed tired and dated, salad wilted and not supposed to be. Muffins dry. He's done several great new cookbooks in past five seven years. How about picking its from them. Honestly my husband cooks bobby flay much better than this restaurant. But hubby is an awesome cook!",1
"Just wanted 2 dozen bagels. Usually they have the grab and go. They told me to wait off to the side while they prepare the boxes. While waiting, I noticed they helped the 3 people behind me before I finally said something and received my order. Service was good, just note that it may take you some extra time.",1
Most recently I had my car washed here. There is a problem that is known in this car wash and has been going on for months. There is a damaged hydraulic line spraying hydraulic oil over all of the driver side of the car. If you have a very nice expensive car I would highly recommend not going . It ends up just smearing in circles and takes forever to get off.,1
"We made reservation through orbtiz. However, the when we reached NY NY hotel they started charging us 20 extra for the resort fees and othe stuffs. As per the reservation, everything was included but the receptionist informed us NO it isn't because ususally they don't charge through ORTIBZ. Bummer to reach the place and have to pay additional fee. Overall the hotel was okay.",1
"I have nothing bad to say about this U Swirl. I visit them on a weekly basis and the greatness of this place is consistent. The place is always clean. Staff is super friendly. They have a great selection of yogurt, sorbet and toppings. Inside is very spacious with several comfy sofas to lounge on while you finish your yogurt.",2
"As the wife of someone who gets his hair cut here, I love coming with him. I get spoiled too. Beer and a shot are free for me even though I don't get my hair cut! Ashley and Kim are wonderful. Everyone is always very friendly and my husband always looks super hot whenever he gets his hair cut here. The price is right too. Just make sure and tip well!",2
I am so upset. Have had great service the 3 times prior but the fact that we are a returning customer could not get the consideration of a phone call back so I could make other plans they check voicemail every day according to their voicemail tells me they don't give a crap. Will never use their service again.,1
"Average sub shop. The Service wasn't very good, very unorganized, we paid before they asked what kind of cheese toppings we wanted and overall just ""blah "". The pasta salad had no flavor, and the sandwich food options mediocre. The soda selections were RC yuck . Nothing out of the ordinary, or to make me want to come back.",1
"A favorite of mine because of the exceptional food, service and ambience. Great weekend brunch w short rib hash or hanger steak w chile pepper. Steaks include unique cuts cooked well and presented iice proportions. Patio overlooking Tivoli Village is fun for people watching. A meat lovers paradise you can visit the butcher shop and bar downstairs.",2
"I go here with coworkers very frequently, and not once have I walked out disappointed! If you are tired of subway or just want a great sub hot or cold come here! I love their club sub ""Mike's way "", and their cheese steak hot sandwich. They are equally fast as subway, but in my opinion much more tastier! I will probably be back here very soon! Enjoy!",2
"Best Greek food I have ever had! After multiple recommendations, a couple girlfriends and I decided to finally check it out. Oh my goodness. This place us excellent! The pita chips, crunchy on the outsides, chewy on the inside. The gyro was so flavor able. Fresh, high quality ingredients. Pita Jungle is over rated in comparison. The service was very friendly.",2
"I go here all the time since its the closest store to where I live. That being said, their prices are not great, the store is VERY run down, and their produce is worse than Walmart. With so many good Fry's grocery stores close by why do I always end up here?! nI do want to mention the customer service isn't bad. Just not the place you wanna bring your wife and little baby to.",1
"The Great Dane is somewhere fun to go with a group of friends. They have a large selection of food, which is usually pretty good. They brew their own beers, which are always quite popular among the guys I am not a beer drinker. In the lower lever they have pool tables, shuffle board and other various games to keep you entertained. Overall a fun spot to go to.",2
"The Carmelizer is delicious. It used to be called the milkyway. nThe baristas here rock. nThe location sucks. Not enough parking, the drive thru is always packed and the wait time is massive. nNone of which will discourage me from returning again and again. nDutch Bros. leaves Starbucks in the dust.",2
"OK it's expensive and loud BUT it's Vegas get over it. The food is cooked to perfection. The service is excellent, not surprisingly. The decor on one of the far walls reminds me of Dante's Inferno, so beautifully carved. I have eaten here 3 times over 1 year and it's consistently high quality. BTW use your cell phones light to read the menu, you'll know what I mean when you try and read the menu",2
Everyone in the store is helpful and if they dont have it or can't do it they have always given me a number of someone local that can! Found our locksmith from them. They are helpful and the military discount on Wednesday and the free popcorn is always good! Great for small things needed for repairs and they have a little bit of everyhting.,2
"For around 40 per person.try to get your money's worth! Eat all the lobster tails, all the shrimps, and all the crab legs you can get your hands on! Our group of 6 waited for an hour and a half to get into this place! Totally worth the wait! Their dessert selection is not that bad either! Try the mango mousse cake.it's delicious!",2
"Amazing view, nice place to see a show. I was blown away by the view as you can see the entire Vegas Valley from atop Mandalay Bay. We were there for the Jake Owens show and I was impressed with how close we were to the artist. Its like having top musicians come to your house and play in your living room. I can't wait until the next event I am fortunate enough to be invited to here.",2
"The food is very tasty. The service was acceptable. The building itself was quite nice. The biggest problem is the prices are astronomical and the portions a bit small. I was here for a party of eight people and the final tab was over 650 dollars and nobody drank alcohol. We got starters, main course, and desserts. If they increase portion size or cut about 40 off the prices, I would go back.",1
"Ok, yes my last is Bond. It really is.but this is such a awesome little place. It is located at the Cosmo which is the coolest hotel in Vegas in my opinion. But it has great music, such a cool atmosphere, and girls dancing in the window. Enough said. Also, was there with my GF on Sunday at around 2am.place was packed. Awesome",2
This verizon location is horrible. The customer service is a NEGATIVE 5 stars. The employees are rude and only see dollar signs rather than assist their customers and provide a great cellular solution. You are better off signing up with another cellular provider or going to another location. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND people NOT to come here,1
"Amazing yoga is great. If you like Baron Baptiste's style of ""Power Vinyasa "" yoga, you'll feel right at home here. At the Shadyside location there is only one room. And the room is not as hot as Bikram yoga. Though it is quite a workout, you'll find that the warmth of the room does indeed help your muscles. You'll be able to do poses that you previously probably never thought you could.",2
"Someone mentioned that AAA gives out free guide books to its members, so I popped in here last week to see what I could get for my upcoming trips to Peru and Japan. They told me they had no guidebooks for anywhere outside the US, and they came back with a fold up world map. Umm yeah, thanks a lot, that's really helpful.",1
Went there for lunch and had the hamburger chimichanga. The first bite tasted a little weird but i ate it anyways It was the only thing I had eaten all day. I came down with food poisening the next morning. I thought the manager would want to know but instead of offering good customer service she insinuated that it was not their food. No appology and very rude. Bad food.bad customer service.,1
The teriyaki bowl with tofu is absolutely delicious! I seriously love love love this restaurant. They have something for everyone here and it's all healthy food. I'm a vegan and they have vegan items on the menu.and they'll also customize things for your dietary needs. The vegetable crudites are awesome as well. I get it with a side of hummus for dipping. It's the perfect appetizer.,2
"Great food, flavor and not unreasonable in price. I mean, yes it is 19 bucks for a drink and a lobsicle but 1 its freakin lobster people! And 2 you're in Vegas, everything is expensive here. Friendly staff, less than 10 minute wait time, great locations. Hoping they expand to California at some point!",2
"If you want a doctor and staff who doesn't make you feel uncomfortable and won't make you dread having to take your child in for a visit, do not go here. I was a month late taking my infant daughter at the time to take her shots and Dr. Nauman would make a negative comment towards me for being late. I never felt comfortable going there. I wish I had found Dr. Marlon Mendoza much sooner.",1
These are the best tacos I've ever had. You must try the spicy pork tacos! The Asada fries are great too but if you order them the half portion is more than enough for two. The full portion could probably feed a few Poeple. The spicy pork fries are great as well. The line can get long especially around 1am but it's a great late night meal after a night of gambling!,2
"I'm actually surprised this only has three stars. I enjoy eating here, the food is always fresh and never runs out. The restrooms are clean. My only complaint is that they charge three yr olds to eat. My son eats a small amount of white rice and Chinese doughnuts, I'm already paying 10 on the weekday to eat, can't we get away with a serving of rice for the little one ?",2
"Founderie is a find run by a friendly low stress gal with great taste, and featuring a nice collection of prints and fashions by local designers, the biggest draw here is the designer vintage Fendi, Yves St Laurent, Burberry, Hermes and more at prices that, if you know how much some places in LA and NYC charge for same, will make your jaw drop.",2
This place is cheesy. After a recent stay I will look elsewhere. It's got themed rooms with generic replicas of props behind a glassed frame. It's basically still the Aladdin with a new facade in front. I know it glitters but it's in a unfinished part of the strip and it just has a isolated and deserted feel to it.,1
"Disappointed. Farhers Day dinner service was slow the bartender served us despite wait staff on floor, the guy did his best, but eh . The prices are Scottsdale high. But all 5 of us were unimpressed with food quality and flavor. Ahi sashimi was delicate and tasty, thus the 2nd star. Sushi was meager for the price. Too many good sushi teppanyaki restaurants out there to be wasting your time here.",1
Never again! I thought id give this place a try and I regret it. I eat often at jacky chans but I wanted to try fried rice since that is hard to mess up. I also purchased wonton soup for my husband since he had a sore throat. The soup was not good and the portion I got for the price I paid was not worth it. The rice was too stale. Won't be back!,1
I ordered the Pu Pu Platter for two as well as the tofu with vegetables plate. I was not exactly impressed. The food was delivered to my door and a few of the packages were either damaged or haphazardly taped together since they wouldn't close all the way. Now for the food. It was. not the best. I could feel my stomach yelling at me as I ate it. I wouldn't try this place again.,1
"We got the chicken burrito and jefe pollo. Both were tasty, but way more food than a normal size human should be able to eat in one sitting. I highly recommend the chipotle cream sauce. Wait staff was really nice, but the abundant number of big screen tvs detracted from the otherwise pleasant atmosphere. As far as Mexican food goes, it won't blow your mind, but it will probably hit the spot.",2
"First, I love Kohl's, but this one is the worst. Went to return a shirt yesterday and stood in line for 45 min because they had one person working that area and were letting people do regular check out. Also, JD, who looked like a manager, would continue to go behind the counter, but never help anyone even though the line was more than 10 deep.",1
"In addition to my grocery shopping, I spent almost 20 minutes just looking thru and reading all of their sunscreen products. Even though I asked multiple questions during that time all of the clerks were very kind, attentive and informative! It was a wonderful experience and with their help, I even found exactly what I wanted.",2
"I eat lunch between 10am and 11am because I begin my day at 5am. I went to Rocky's recently at 10 30am to give them another shot. Their door said they opened at 10 30am. The door was locked. Waited for two minutes, still no one. Went to my car. As I drove out the lot I saw someone opening the door. Bye bye.",1
"Ok, to be honest, I haven't actually been to the restaurant, but my husband brought me home the Spaghetti Bolognese for dinner. Holy moly even re heated it is some of the best pasta sauce I've had! Delicious! I can't wait to actually come in to the restaurant and try more food. You have successfully satisfied this pregnant lady's craving. Thanks Gasper's!",2
"This place has the goods! The best tortas in Phoenix and the best Mango natural sweet waters for miles. The sevice is always friendly and the place is kept clean for the most part. Parking is a pain on weekends because their lot is small, but once you're inside, you will no regret it. Try their original Torta Paquime, it will make your mouth water. ",2
"I ate here with my family about a month ago and it was absolutely terrible. Del Taco serves Mexican food more ""genuine "" than this place. The beans were bland, the prices were not great and it was not a good experience overall. The only thing giving this place 2 stars was its sanitation.very clean. Other than that, my family will never eat here again.",1
This place level of customer service is a joke. New home same bad service. It's a shame because the food is good but the service No Bueno. Plus they need some help and training from the health district because the cashier is getting money and touching plates without washing her hands. They also need more waiters. Service at the new location was very slow and rude.,1
"Had steam pork buns ""xiao long bao "" , fried dumplings, a beef noodle bowl and a wontooodle. noodle soup a bit watery but sizes were amazing. Biggest beef noode bowl. But the noodles are thin and round not fat flat and chewy. The soups were mild and not strong. Ok place for a large or giant bowl of noodles.",2
Terrible. Do not call rotor rooter. They wanted 212 to unclog a toilet. The guy was so rude when I said too much. He said good luck finding someone else to do it for less. We did. TCH Plumbing in Phoenix did it for 70. They will not quote a price on the phone. The guy comes out for free and then tries to sell you things you do not need. DO NOT Use Rotor Rooter.,1
"Definition Price gouging is a pejorative term referring to a situation in which a seller prices goods or commodities much higher than is considered reasonable or fair. nI've got a frozen broken outdoor pipe, It's shut off and not causing damage. These guys show up and want 655 to replace. Yikes. Bye. P.S. when I object the guy Doc says "" some people can afford it and some can't "". Nice.",1
"Tried the Wagyu Beef Chef's Menu, paired with wines. Very tasty and more than abundant food. My one regret is that we didn't get to try the desserts at our leisure. We ran into a time crunch to attend our show and had to pack out our sweet treats for late that night. Overall a good steak house with high quality food.",2
"This is a Sushi Palace. The tastes, textures and ambiance far surpass all other sushi restaurants in both Gilbert and Queen Creek. My son and I have tried them all. We always come back to Sea Star. We typically start with 3 or 4 rolls followed by noodles. My son says that the Yakiudon is the best. Tonight I tried the Katsu chicken. It was awesome.",2
"I have to come to this Starbucks because its the only one in my area between home and work. Too bad its the slowest Starbucks I've EVER visited. It seems like they could use their staff more wisely when a rush comes in. There is no sense of urgency when taking your order or preparing it. Just leaves me feeling frustrated. Staff is nice at least, maybe too nice.",1
"No waiting in bar area for lunch. Ordered the beef brisket sandwich and potato salad and sweet tea. nSandwich was hot and shredded brisket was lean and tasty. Comes with very ligght sauce so you can adjust it to your taste with the 3 tabletop BBQ sauces. nGreat side order options, try thre potato salad and mac n cheese,. Definately upper end BBQ joint with medium to upper end prices and worth it.",2
It must have been shift change time when I stopped in for a small snack. The manager was taking orders and then ran down the line to work the register while I saw three employees lounging about in uniform. The register was so backed up that my order came while I was still in line and the gal plopped my dish onto the counter in front of the register. How classy.,1
"Fun restaurant with great horror props! Went for a couple of drinks and a appetizer. Casket of chips is a tasty appetizer. We had the swamp water, and the berry scary for drinks. Both were tasty. Next time we will try the rest of the menu. Very great concept. I hope the restaurant continues to shine!",2
The one time I ate here it was absolutely disgusting. They used a microwave to cook our appetizer which was rubbery. The actual meal was flavorless. I had an upset stomach for the rest of the night. If your at this place just walk next store to Brew Brothers or the Mongolian grill. You won't regret it.,1
Finally a place that serves legitimate Russian Cuisine in Las Vegas. The Food was delicious. The ambiance of the place was awesome The price was right. The service was spectacular. The owner Alex went out of his way to make you feel special. I can see coming back to this place over and over again. Definitely a must try it out place.,2
"Great authentic place for Mexican cuisine. The second you walk in it just gives off a good vibe. Food was really good too, I ordered the fajitas and everything came out fresh and hot. Only thing I wasn't too fond of was the guacamole. It was too plain. Just avocados and cilantro. It needed more salt line juice onions peppers etc.",2
"I went to this place last Saturday after reading all the great reviews. However, after eating the Carne Asada burrito, which was mediocre at best and the salsa wasn't even hot. I was greatly disappointed by this place. I don't know if they changed chefs from all the other reviews, but this place isn't worth stopping by.",1
"I recently went to a Yelp Event and tried the Party Booths picture booth for the first time. So much fun! This would be a blast to have at a wedding or big b day party. Oh, and they aren't only in Vegas. I live in Cali and they have ppl servicing N Cali and the Bay. Check em out on www.partybooths.com",2
"Found this on Yelp, and it does not disappoint. They are extremely friendly and honest. Very good price and they did an excellent job. You can trust them with your wedding gown and suit. They offer free bottle of cold water in the store, that's very thoughtful of them especially during summertime. Highly recommend.",2
"This was fantastic. I had the country breakfast burrito egg, potato, cheese . Everything was nice and fresh and not too greasy. It honestly tasted like something I would make at home, but better because someone else cooked it. Fast drive thru service and there was 4 cars behind me. I am looking forward to trying some of the other goodies on the menu.",2
Had a really bad experience at check in that made me feel unwelcome. The property itself was fine clean and pleasant enough. A good physical facility has to be staffed with people that have a service mentality and that work to establish an environment that is welcoming and warm. The Tropicana has a ways to go to meet what I believe are reasonable service standards for the hotel they say they are.,1
Completely agree with Seth Y. on the smell issue. Other than that the green fees are reasonable as long as you don't mind golfing in the afternoon. Everything is very organized and well marked and the course is fun and challenging for players of all skill levels. I can't wait to go back and actually get to finish 18. Slow groups should be forced off the course! Grr,2
"An enormous place that is perfect for bringing a big group to hang out at the tables. Got a liter of hefeweizen and dinner was great, huge portions, and most importantly, they got the sauerkraut right, important for any German place. Check out the gift shop too, the prices on souvenir stuff was a lot better than other places I've been to",2
"A must visit, but their pizza is awful, their hot dogs are tasteless, and their fries are well fries. A tip for the newbie If you order a small fries, they use a small cup to fill up a brown bag of fries, and turn the cup upside down on the whole thing. If you order a large, they do the same with a large cup filling up the same size bag , for a larger price. ",1
"Darlene is awesome. I had to have my bridesmaid dress taken in in the bust and had to have it done in under a week. Darlene did an awesome job on the alteration and had it done in six days. I paid 45, which seems totally reasonable to me. I'll definitely go back to Darlene for my other alterations and repairs.",2
I had a unique problem and lost all of my information from my phone. Alberto Beccerra spent hours fixing my phone even though he did not have to. Other people in the store did not want to help me but Alberto did everything he could to help me. Thanks to Alberto everything is back on my phone and everything is working better than it was before thank you very much Alberto I appreciate you.,2
"Yes, it's free, but so are those cheesy Greek robot performers at Ceasar's. The show starts at 6 and runs every hour on the hour. To be honest I think the best part is that on a cold night you can feel the warmth from the fire, but you can also stay warm inside the casino, which is where I will stay next time.",1
"Don't go here. I did for years and I believe that the vet had her own personal health issues interfere with her practice. At one time I trusted Dr. Mceachern, but I truly believe that if I hadn't taken my dog elsewhere for treatment she would have killed him. She overdosed him on two antibiotics and almost shut his liver down. The tech's there are always really nice.",1
"This place is quite possible the best guns ammo store in the valley. Not a great selection of handguns but man oh man, their ammo selection is amazing and the prices are even better. Staff is extremely knowledgeable and professional unlike other guns stores in the area where they think they are the bee's knees, this guys might actually be. Would definitely recommend 100 .",2
Well I hate to disagree with the reviews on here about this place but I thought the food was sub par. I am not sure if I went on an off night but I was not impressed at all. I had monkey balls and ninja jalapenos to start and they were terribly breaded and flavorless. Next came locally named rolls that were all covered in eel sauce and were not made with quality ingredients.,1
"This place is great! We just moved from Peoria and this one is just as good as the one on union hills. Yummy custard and Ice, you can't go wrong for a cold treat! My only wish is that this location had more flavors of custard instead of just the standard choc and vanilla. Overall I highly recommend ",2
"This place says it's closed but they aren't! They open 9am on the weekdays! Anyway, I wasn't too impressed with the staff nor the store. Everything seems highly overpriced and it doesn't help that the staff aren't very friendly either. Not sure if I'll go back to this place, much rather buy cheaper party stuff at Target!",1
I took curtain panels to West Harris Cleaners and I am extremely happy with their service and prices. My panels were perfect and the Gentleman helped me carry them to my car. I am in a heavy foot boot. I will bring all my dry cleaning to West Harris Cleaners and will recommend to all my friends and family.,2
"My wife had a buy one, get one coupon in recognition of her birthday so she ordered a full rack of baby back ribs while I ordered pork shoulder. The ribs were overdone and the pork shoulder lacked flavor. The sides were hit and miss potato salad too much mayo , baked beans excellent and mac and cheese fair . We are going to take a pass on this offer in the future",1
"I have 2 small dogs. To say that I love my dogs would be an understatement! nI am ecstatic that I have found this incredible pet sitting and dog walking service. Liz is wonderful with them, and I feel at peace while at work knowing that my ""children "" are in good hands I wish I knew about this company sooner!",2
"In a city full of bars and clubs, this one holds its own by being a dive bar. only las vegas style. people don't come here in jeans unless their american rag but at least you can get in somewhere with jeans, right? In any case, this is a nice placeto set up shop when you feel like going out, but not going all out.",2
"I love this place. The owners don't speak or understand english but their kids do. They are a great little family doing their thing. Great food prepared fast with large orders. I eat here often, and would eat here everyday if I could. Alot of the larger restaurants could learn alot from this little gem. great food. The fried rice here is the goods. WiFi is free as there is a startbucks next door.",2
I am a professional realtor and just had the experience of dealing with this company and would NOT recommend them. They did not perform the drilling on a termite treatment until called to the carpet and asked to complete the service. Even then they did not complete the drawing showing a thorough treatment as required by the state.,1
Not very happy after tonight's visit. Food was undercooked for both of us and we ended up having to pay full price for bottle of wine because apparently if you have a Groupon which doesn't even cover alcohol they penalize you for having it. Tonight's dinner ended up costing more than our norm. Really unhappy and we were regulars so I'm not sure that we will return.,1
"I went here with my best friend recently. Her fish was dried out and full of bones and the waitress acted incredibly rude and pious to us. I ordered a quesadilla, and it came in a little basket cut up and stacked, was incredibly thin and tiny, and tasted funky and gave me a bad aftertaste that lasted all night. We're never coming back to Tempe Markeplace, let alone King's Fish House.",1
Just tried to return a birthday gift tea pot . I had the receipt and purchase was just 7 days ago. They would not accept because it was bought on sale. They said the policy is on the receipt. Receipts are typically given to you after the purchase is final. Clerk just shrugged his shoulders when I questioned the policy. I honestly will not shop there again.,1
"Nasty Nasty nasty. All I can say is the garlic bread is good. The spagetti I had tasted better straight from a can! Don't forget to bus your table when leaving and leave a tip? Why? It's sad, but on yelp the two categories that get my attention to yelp are the worst and the best. This by far falls in the worst category.",1
My husband was 9 minutes late to an appointment with the nurse. They turned him away because he was late. The last time we were in the office we waited over 40 minutes for somebody to enter the exam room. And you're telling me we would have seen the nurse exactly at 10 am had he been on time? Seriously? Last visit at their office.,1
"Great local italian place. Million dollar view from the patio of the valley. The Bolongese was very taste and the pasta was cooked al dente. Kid friendly and good service. I did a banquet here for some doctors and the food was tasty then. If you can serve tasty banquet style food for 50 people, you can serve tasty food for 6 people. Hidden gem in Henderson.",2
"I seldom write reviews, but the service here was horrible. When we visited, the hostess seemed to treat us like we were a nuisance. We were seated after a group that came in after us even though we had less people! I witnessed the hostess treat several people rudely. I caot comment on the food because we left.",1
I've been here several times by myself and my daughter but this time I decided to take the other kids and hubby to the kids paint day. We all had a blast! Everyone had a great time and the free juice and cookies were a nice touch for the kids! nI'll never get tired of going to Design Wine! Addicted!,2
"This review is based on Happy Hour, which is great. I went with some girlfriends before a book reading, and for 6 of us we had a glass or two of wine each, and some appetizers for under 60. The appetizers were delish antipasto, bruschetta, etc. Maybe I can go back for dinner but it will have to be a special occassion.that s t's expensive!",2
"Hate this bar. The only good time to go is when it's nearly empty. As soon as people start really piling in, the lines get too long, the bartenders turn into assholes who play favorites, and the douchiest douchebags fill Brothers shoulder to shoulder. I don't get why people go here just for the wings.",1
Great selection and very clean and organized but some prices were just OUTRAGEOUS for a store that takes donations! I was surprised but maybe location is key? I might return as it is very close to my house but I don't know. I saw a pair of jeans for 29.99 as well as an area rug for 79.99.that seems crazy to me for a goodwill.,1
"I think this place is great. We'll jump on the light rail, head down for a game, and it's all relatively painless. The ball park is always nice and clean and you can get some pretty good deals on tickets. The whole family loves going and we are certainly not avid baseball fans. I don't think anybody could go wrong coming to a game and checking it out.",2
"Oh my gosh the food was so good! You have to try the chili queso and jalepeno hot dogs I got that along with some fried pickles and a coke. You can't beat it service was amazing with new staff that is 10 times better, owner personally greeted me while I was at the table and gave me some of the history from when her dad started in 1954. This place is landmark for Charlotte and a must try!",2
"We ate here twice during our recent trip. They are incredible with gluten allergies. Their staff is well trained, friendly, and attentive. I had a lamb burger that was out of this world amazing. We also did brunch there one mid morning. What a great spot to have a relaxing long brunch! Food was fantastic both times and the pricing was very reasonable for vegas strip!",2
"I have been here over the years and have enjoyed the food and not so much the atmosphere. Well, all that has changed. I have been here since they remodeled and it looks great. nNow I can enjoy the delicious Korean cuisine, watch the Korean TV shows and relax in the newly remodeled dining area. I love the variety of flavorful kimchis. nSuch a delight and I can't wait to return.",2
"Recently moved 100 ft, right around the corner. If you're having trouble locating it, its in town hall, footsteps from the Post Office. I went for one of their Friday tastings and it was great. Found a nice bottle of Tim Mondavi's Continuum and a substantial discount normally much more expensive . They also have other rarities like Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. nNice!",2
"Cheap, wonderful food. I love how they offer free bubble tea great flavour too for dinner, and the dinners are cheap, filling, and delicious. Chinese style Chinese food, tastes exactly like Chinese food should. Good decor too. Although I've ordered the combo meals and the taste varies from cook to cook, it's always good enough for me to want to come back.",2
"I would give this place zero stars if I could. Were all avid golfers and this place was complete garbage. It's fun if you like to triple overpay and you like billboards blocking your shots in the fairway. Super narrow manufactured fairways in the middle of beantown. Have fun. Go play Siena, rhodes, or bears best instead. Do yourself a favor.",1
Cafe Aroma was a very pleasant place to kill time for a few hours. The food was good I had a pesto and tomato grilled sandwich yum! and so was the coffee. The people were very nice. Seemed like a smaller seating area and less of a cozy atmosphere compared with Cafe Kopi around the corner. Otherwise the two were comparable and I could happily spend time in either one again.,2
Yummy lunch here at this new Establishment. Plenty of parking in the private lot and prices here are reasonable. The Banchan was exceptional. I ordered the 2 meat combo plate for lunch spicy chicken and Bulgogi. The entree came with salad and steam rice Service here is on the spot and the place is clean. Reasonable prices and quality food makes this an ideal place for lunch or a quick meal.,2
"Let me just start by saying a YUM! The burger is flame broiled juicy and seasoned just right. I like mine with crispy bacon and cheese. The cheese is gooey and melted by the delicious greasyness of it all! The fries are fat and go great with the greasy, juicy yummyness! If you want a tasty fat juicy burger go see Lenny! They also have a drive through at this location. Perfect on my way home.",2
"After moving to Vegas from LA, I checked out a few Dentist offices around town. This was the only office that did not try to up sell me on unnecessary procedures or laser treatments. The staff were very friendly, patient, and understanding! I'm so thankful I found this wonderful office. I highly recommend!",2
Had a mini emergency and they got me right it. The vet was great with my cat and the staff was amazing. They have a great price and wellness package that I got that covered everything my cat need plus her shots when she needs them. I will miss my old vet but this is so much closer and they where great. If you live in the South Phoenix or Laveen area this is a great place to take your pets.,2
This was a VERY PLEASANT surprise. The food was phenomenal and the service was excellent. I had never been to an all vegetarian restaurant let alone a vegan. My lunch companion is a vegetarian and she had nothing but praise for this place. We shared the 'Spicy Cha Cha' and the 'Sweet Sour Devine'. One word . YUMM O for both. We left saying that we had to return SOON.,2
"3.5 stars seems a little more appropriate. Service was ok, nothing great as we waited awhile between refills. Food was good other than the turkey bacon, which was not hot and very limp. Place is clean with friendly staff and the menu has something for everyone. One of the better versions of Denny's.",2
Paradise Valley customer very satisfiedI submitted a request online at 7 30am and received a call promptly at 8am same day scheduling pick up by 12 30p again same day . They gave a discount for online request and called when 10 minutes out. The truck was equipped for hauling recycling and the guys were very professional. Great customer service! And reasonably priced ,2
I'm surprised at how many people like this place. Ordered food from them and after only a few bites me and my hubby where extremely disappointed and bummed out that we had spent money on this place. Our dogs however where very happy to get a special treat. Guess it is back to the drawing board on a good Chinese place that delivers.,1
"CARS is awesome! Rosa helped me fix my Jeep and she did it honestly and intelligently. I had gotten the run around on a fix by 3 other shops by male mechanics of course . Rosa knew her stuff, fixed the car, charged fair prices, and talked to me like I actually had a brain. Thank you, Rosa! I'll be back for sure!",2
"This place was cool to stop into on the way to a game. A friend and I each ordered a 7 "" mini pizza and it was great. Thick crust, but not overly filling, which is always a plus. Also ordered a salad that we split and it was pretty tasty. This place has character and the wait staff was really nice. I look forward to visiting agaiext year.",2
"PhXpress is a particularly convenient store located inside the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. I stopped on the way to my flight to pick up gum and a water. Got in and out in two minutes without complete financial rape. If you are needing soft drinks, use the vending machine and save yourself some coin. PhXpress. CAN YOU DIG IT.",2
"The atmosphere was great went for dinner before concert Mandalay but the bartender was slow took 15 minutes to get a martini! inconsistent 2nd martini was terrible. The food was awful as well everything we ordered was over cooked halibut was dry, risotto was like big ball of dough ""chips "" fish chips were soggy.",1
"The beer selection was great, the food was decent, the service was terrible. I'm normally not one to complain about service at a restaurant, but our server seemed awfully put out that she had to even deal with us. Any place that has summer shandy on tap usually gets automatic points from me, but I probably won't be back here.",1
"My husband and two kids came here for breakfast shortly after they opened the restaurant. It was nothing special, nothing seems homemade, reminded me of Cafe 49 in Lake Wylie. The air conditioning was on full blast and made our food go cold very quickly. We have never returned. I will say however the server was nice and attentive and the place was clean.",1
"The good food is ABSOLUTELY destroyed by then CONSTANT WAIT! I've never been through the drive thru where I haven't had to turn off my car and wait for up to 20 minutes to get to the window. The sweet stuff is always kind and helpful, but you can tell they do not want to pay the money to stuff it appropriately. Which makes me choose not to go there when I need fast service, unfortunately.",1
"Nice happy hour deals, but I like to sit at the bar and watch a game and to get served there is nearly impossible! Every time I've been here the same female bartender fails to acknowledge me for 10 minutes and then fails to acknowledge me for another 30 minutes after I received my first beer. Good food but horrible service.",1
"Ambiance 5 stars for a Vietnamese restaurant, that is, not a steak house nFood 1.5 stars nService 2.5 stars So after hearing how great this place was from a friend, I finally tried it out, and was shocked. The food was not tasty I think it was the chicken in the Pho that tasted bad. The rest was just bland. Never been back.",1
Love the food not a fan of the atmosphere though. The blueberry pancakes with the orange butter are fabulous and have completely changed the way I make pancakes at home. I also love the breakfast sandwich so good! The one thing I don't like about the place is how loud it is the acoustics of the place just seem to amplify everything and it gets too loud for me to really enjoy if it's super busy.,2
"This place is close to the Southside and all the bars in favor in this portion of Pittsburgh. The hotel has a nice bar attached. It was a very good place to stay and then enjoy the night life. Overall the rooms were nice and clean, the location was great. Price about 170 a night due to the location walking distance to all the bars on Southside nLocation Great nService Great nI would recommend.",2
Best food ever and the service is very great! I have been going there for years and always had a great experience with the servers and the food is always as I order it. The only thing this locatioeeds to do is make sure there is plenty of chips and that they are fresh. Make sure you say plenty of chips and fresh! This place is great!,2
"visited the bar wanting to go to the restaurant next door. The sign on the for said it opens at 9 am it was 930 the door was still locked. Decided to try the Bar. Smelled smokey. I'll let you know about the food.ok, I now have finished my food. Food was good, but not great. I'm still a lil irriatated that the restaurant side wasn't open when advertised. Would I visit here again? Probably not.",1
"I am not even a customer here and they jacked up my car! I was shopping in the Pavilions, come out and there is their post card type flyer shoved in my window, guess the seal was too tight so the flyer guy just tore it. I called asked for the manager he told me WHATEVER, GET OVER YOURSELF and hung up! Awesome",1
"Good food, good service. I even got a nutrition menu when I asked for it the nutrition info is available on their web site but it is not very easy to read on the smart phone screen . I wish they has some options for health conscious people and those items were listed in a separate section say under 500 calories, or 700 calories .",2
"Stayed here for business last week and my reaction is meh. Nothing special about this Scottsdale Road property. It was really pretty expensive 279 night in April and you don't get a lot for your money. Nothing ""wrong "" with the place, but you can do better for the money. I don't know how they can call it a ""resort "" unless have a pool qualifies you no golf tennis, no spa, etc. Just a hotel.",1
"Aside from their good selection of juice, I don't usually like to go here. They are extremely rude and don't really pay attention to the average customer. They normally will just ignore non regulars who come in the store and won't even spit out a simple hello. There are many other shops you can go to in the area with a better atmosphere and better customer service.",1
"Overcooked pasta, check. Slopped on sauce. Check. Average garlic bread. Check. Crowds of families thinking it's fab. Whatever. r n r nLook people, al dente and toss the Alfredo on the noodle. It's not all bad, but if I want to go shabby chic and chow with the family it's okay. Not my deal, though. I like Italian served in sexy dark corners of the room with my honey.",1
"I went to Sage for a tasting menu with my husband for his birthday last year, which is our tradition. The tasting menu at Sage is, by far, the worst tasting menu I have ever had. The service was fine, but the food was gross. I can't speak to the regular menu, but definitely don't get the tasting menu. Overpriced and disgusting.",1
"There isn't much to be said about this particular location except that I really liked it. I stopped by here at around 5 pm on a Sunday and ordered a cheese pizza with mushrooms, basil and anchovies not my ideal toppings but I went along with it . The pizza turned out to be delicious the ambience was great and it wasn't too noisy. I don't care what anyone says, Grimaldi pizza is great!",2
"Your worst nightmare will become sweet dreams when you go to Seville Family Dentistry! nI had a phobia of going to the dentist for 50 years after being bullied by a dentist when I was a child. nI did take anxiety medication twice when I first started going to Seville, but never since that! nWhat a wonderful experience to be treated by such fabulous dentists and their most outstanding staff!",2
"This place leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to decor. My family popped in for a bite after they got off the plane. I wasn't too hungry, so I got spring rolls, which were alright. Not great, but good. My mom and dad had a bowl of pho, and both said they weren't great. Which is pretty bad since they're not really ones to give negative feedback. There's better pho out there.",1
"So this was my second go round at Carrabba's by Concord Mills. I must say that the service was much better than the first time. Here's to hoping that last time was an isolated incident and won't be a problem in the future. Once again, they did a top notch job cooking the food. If I can get over how they look, muscles may be a new favorite!",2
"I came here a couple weeks ago to get some coffee after hearing good things about this place. The coffee was just not very good. It didn't have a lot of flavor and just was meh. I might have high expectations after living in Seattle, but this coffee wasn't even as good as dunkin donuts. so. I'd pass.",1
I love Francescas style but had a horrible experience in the store today. I ordered a bunch of clothes online and all of it was way too big. When trying to return clothes at the store. they tried to con me into storw credit. Stating the policy was 2 weeks to return. I had to go online and read the policy. horrible customer aervice. But I got my money back,1
"Nice place, great outdoor space! Sat outside in the sun had a FEW too many Rum Punches.but thats just a part of the experience, right? The staff wasn't overly friendly, but the drinks were decently priced it had a great atmosphere. Went again at night they had a DJ which was pretty cool. I would go agaiext time I am in Vegas.but maybe a few less Rum Punches ",2
Went there with a few buddies the other week on football Sunday. Wings were ok but extremely over priced. Waited a longtime for the order as well. Bucket of beers was reasonable. It's going to be tough for them to complete against Native New Yorker when they do .49 wings on Sunday. I would of paid half the price for better wings if I would of gone there.,1
"When you pull up to Beckett's table, you truly don't realize the amazing experience you are about to have. From the decor to the service to the food, everything is excellent. I had the deviled eggs of the day and the pork osso bucco with a glass of ice cold white wine and I could not have been happier. The osso bucco was totally wonderful. This place is definitely a must try!",2
"Great sports bar feel. Lots of TVs. If you are looking for a menu of perfect bar food, this is the place. From Burgers to Pizza and chicken fingers. And all the fried appetizer favorites. With the great sports bar feel on one side, they have a family friendly dining room also. The owners are hands on and greet everyone. And if watching the game gets boring, they offer off track betting.",2
"Sporting Goods Department review Consistantly bad service in sporting goods, especially if you need counter service fishing license, for example . Was there today for a license, and waited 25 minutes for an associate to arrive. Same issue the last few times I've visited that department. Get it together Wal Mart!",1
"Waited an hour and a half for our food. The only good part was the salmon sashimi which is unprepared, raw fish. The rolls were pretty average, filled with creams and sauces which isn't very Japanese in my opinion . Maybe I'm not a fan of fusion sushi but all I can say is that adding BBQ sauce to a roll is the wrong move. Very average.",1
"This place was the only good restaurant that was open until 2am Sunday morning, so we decided to try it. What a surprise! It was fantastic. Service was quick and really friendly. Not once did we feel rushed to leave so they could go home. We had this appetizer that was a foursome of sushi, it was to die for! Everything was fantastic. I can't wait for my next trip to go here again!",2
"Too loud but otherwise awesome. There are a lot of things to look at, in case you are with someone you don't really want to talk to. Fortunately that was not my situation. I don't think the drinks or service really stood out but they were okay and the atmosphere is just so much the star of this show. Not intimate or romantic but definitely interesting.",2
"This is the closest coffee shop to ETC where I go to school and on rare occasions when I get a few minutes off, this is where I run to get my coffee fix. They have a nice selection of super sweet coffee drinks and your basics latte, mocha, etc., free wifi, pastries, and when the weather's nice they open the big glass garage door in front.",2
I love it here. One of my favorite places to go see what they have put up. I just love how everything is made up of sorts of flowers plants. The displays are so breathtaking eye catching. A perfect place to take pictures though it is always packed with tourists but usually late at nights its quiet. ,2
This place is okay only if you're really hungry between classes and don't have a lot of time to eat. However it's way too overpriced and they barely give you any food. I wouldn't eat here if I was able to just go home and make the food myself since they basically give you crappier versions of food you can make at home.,1
"I wish I can give no stars, this place was terrible and so was the food the lady wasn't listening. We asked three times for some mandarin sauce we asked the last at the counter once and she was perfect but the lady named Daisy taking orders is rude an ruins you're day. when we open the boxes it's all a mess and the looked old awful. 1st and last time customer to this location.",1
Just returned from a work lunch here and had a lovely time. There was a good variety of lunches available and a the portions were generous. The service was excellent there were quite a few work parties at the same time as ours and we were treated to speedy and friendly service. nI had a salad with goat cheese and an incredible apple raspberry crisp for dessert. nWould definitiely go back there.,2
"sorry qc cafe if i could do a 1 2 star more i would you are delightful people but the breakfast i ordered ,waffle w bacon and 2 eggs was not bad but for as quick as it came out of the kitchen it was not hot at all not cold to speak of just not hot my wife had a burrito when i asked her how it was she was not overly excited and the hash browns she got were not hot either",1
"Love this place. Food is always amazing and the service is great. They have great salads and portions are gigantic. Just avoid going here on weekends in the wee hours because you'll be surrounded by drunk, half naked girls and douchy guys that just got out of the clubs. Unless you want to see girls walking around shoeless and guys fist pumping to imaginary bass sounds.",2
Do not I repeat do not stay here. There are so many better options in Vegas. This place was absolutely filthy and I didn't feel like a VIP that's for damn sure. I felt like we were standing in a social services line for government aid when checking in.The line was super slow. I would never stay here again unless they did a total renovation and gave me an offer I couldn't pass up.,1
Omg! No Napkins! Unacceptable! Shift manager should have asked one of her employees to go out to the dollar store buy napkins for customers. Instead of asking her employees to apologize for the inconvenience. No one had Napkins! Employees were unhappy customers left upset. I will not return to this Dunkin donuts! Buy Napkins! That's what petty cash is for. Not great managerial skills disappointed!,1
"produce epic fail. not fresh, at. all. nmeat this redeems my 1 star review up only a notch.it's great to have harris beef, but watch the expirations because they're not. something is definitely amiss.things just aren't like they used to be here. so it's officially off my list for groceries. I'd rather pay WF prices, and get the quality and freshness, then risk it at Sunflower. that bad.",1
I would give no stars if that was an option. Below average food. Tartar sauce in packages ew that don't open. Probably for the better. They don't have half of what is on the menu. Tables were dirty. Staff was not helpful and seemed to not really care. Save yourself and DON'T GO. You are better off with. McD's Filet O Fish.it's that bad.,1
"Went there for lunch today. I needed something fast and yummy. As I was walking up after 1 30 I saw their specials. Lemon chicken, yummy. As I ordered, they were out, out of every pasta they made for today. They had pizza but only margarita and bianca. I ordered one slice of bianca and back to work.I've had much better food. Or maybe I just had my taste buds set for lemon chicken.",1
"I dont know about the other dishes, but their ""pad thai "" is absolutely atrocious. I have never tried noodles as sour as sour patch kids candy until now. Also, enjoy their fake sriracha sauce and chemical hot mustard. If that doesnt get you hospitalized i dont know what will. However, enjoy the fortune cookies!",1
This was one of the coolest clubs I have ever been to. Its kinda small but very nice atmosphere when you are able to look off the balcony. The drinks are exspensive but the shots are cheap. 6.00. nI had a blast here when I was there a few weeks ago. But try to get on the guest list because the line will be long.,2
Was looking for new stylist so went on Yelp and found Mood Swing. So made an appointment and had a haircut to fix last cut she did ok job not what I was expecting according to reviews. So deceived to try again to change my color and did not come out at all like was hoping and haircut was not even at all will not go back again.,1
The food was amazing! We went on Sunday 8 17 14 before our flight back home. They wait wasnt long which was a surprise. Our waiter was friendly. The food was good. I wasnt expecting such big portions! I was so full i didnt get any dessert! Thats what they are known for. The frozen hot chocolate. I guess this means i will be making another Vegas trip soon!,2
"I was just in there for lunch today and I gotta say for the 3rd time trying it I don't like it. The food is so so, some salty, some there was no flavor at all. The service sucked I was waiting at least 10 minutes for a refill, plus on top of that I had to flag the server down in spanish, just so they would come over. Well what do I expect, it's a cheap buffet",1
"The Fairmont Princess seems to have gotten its service act together. We stayed here during Baseball Spring Training, and the service was much improved! Now, if they can only install wi fi, they move up to 5 stars! Note The Gold section has wi fi. Service is spotty, but the rest of the resort does not.",2
I had never shot a gun before and was nervous about doing it. These guys made it very simple to understand how fire arms are just a tool for self defense and the basics can be learned easily. The course is great.the instructors really know their stuff! I'm looking forward to taking a more advanced class from them.,2
"Service is good, food made in a timely manner. I'm a vegetarian so only main option is the Mushroom Panini which is fabulous and comes with a pickle and coleslaw. It is right across the Chase Tower where I'm currently training and will hopefully train in the future so Silver Spoon will be seeing more of me. Only request would be more vegetarian, healthier, organic options.",2
" Update I was contacted by someone from Hooter's Hotel and Casino with an apology and assurance that this was not their regular code of conduct. I was offered a partial refund, which was pretty generous in my opinion. However, after providing my travel information, I have not heard back since nor received said refund. I appreciate the apology at least, hence the extra star.",1
"We stayed at Polo Towers as a timeshare.pool cut on foot great service. they call every time after to check that you got the service asked for like more towels, extra key etc. Great space, clean rooms, right off the strip and totally accomadating. The only bummer was that taxis are hard to come by at there roundabout.",2
"I'm not really a big fan of JIB in general, but I must say that this one surprised me. The cashiers are always friendly and quick and the manager is always eager to ensure each customer is treated like royalty. The only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is the disconcerting fact that the restrooms are kept under lock and key.you have to ask the cashier to unlock it.",2
"Ill trained and inattentive staff. Wait staff was completely disorganized. Took 5 mins to be acknowledged for seating and then another 10 mins to have our order taken, all while having to endure super loud obnoxious music. Since I found these guys in Groupon I was disappointed to learn that they did not honor the Groupon after 10 PM. Really lame as there was no mention of that.",1
"Horrible! I used to go to a different location that was good but this one is terrible so slow and check out the pic of my food. They didn't even put the cucumber salsa on my taco WTH there are only 4 ingredients you could remember all 4? And the ""kale slaw "" was 3 pieces of kale and barely anything else. Next time I want tacos I'll just go to Taco Bell that's how bad these were!",1
"What the heck? What happened here? It says ""Same Slices "" on the window, looks identical to Slices inside, it even still has the newspaper cutout of when Slices opened at Tempe Marketplace. this is no Slices though. It feels different inside and the pizza isn't quite as good. I'm so confused. I miss Slices.",1
"Went there today to buy a handbag and there was a good and bad. The bad, a worker named Sam gave us attitude and acted like she was doing us a favor while the other worker her manager wanted to give us a discount on a bag 10 she had something personal with us it seemed. Will never go back if this girl still works there. Bad business.",1
"I have only been here for drinks, they have some happy hour specials because cheaper boozes is always good. The drinks are pretty good and the service was not bad. The decor feels very traditional European with the colors and the trimmings. It is right by the pool so you can have sit inside or out while enjoying your drink and food.",2
"Such a sweet place! We came here for Sunday brunch and it was amazing. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They recommended the iced coffee and it really was the best iced coffee I have ever had. I got the veggie quiche and my boyfriend got the pork sandwich, both were amazing. The inside and the patio are so cute, we will definitely be back!",2
"Worst services I have ever experienced! They are slow, I swear they hire retarded people to work there, you would get better customer service and smarter people if you put McDonalds workers in there! Total assholes, Worst customer services I ever experienced! I will NEVER use them again! This review is regarding the Vision Center!",1
"This was the first diner that I've been to but I was not impressed at all. The food was just okay, nothing to rave about. You can find your regular grease laden favorites here. As far as specialties go, I'd say, the diner stack? If you're looking for a fast track to a heart attack after a game at the Assembly Hall, look no further.",1
"I can't comment on the hiking trail itself as I've only done the drive up AZ 88, but Canyon Lake is absolutely gorgeous. I've always wanted to do the hike, but don't quite have the proper gear. Word of caution AZ 88 is fairly treacherous in some parts I wouldn't advise doing this drive without a four wheel drive.",2
"This place is right down the street from me, so it's definitely convenient. I think their food is delicious! I've had the Pad Thai several times, the garlic chicken, and the green chili chicken. I was not disappointed by any of them. I highly recommend it. The staff is always polite and the service is great.",2
"I actually liked this course. maybe because I shot well on it, and that I went with some other people that paid for it, and I was on vacation and. Ok. it wasn't a GREAT course, but the experience was good. Probably a moderate level course that, as many vegas courses are, was relatively well kept up and wasn't that busy.",2
"We love it! We actually ate at Fatz' the first day we moved into the neighborhood. We wanted to take the friends and family members who helped us with the move out for a nice meal. It was great. We too were offered platters of the calabash chicken for being first time customers. Service is great, quick and friendly, and everything is good. I love the chicken pot pie.",2
Dont go ! dont waist your money no one in the club. the management does not know how to run the club nor do they pick up the phone or email you back ! nThey say 18 and up for events but per the manager last friday 8 23 13 it's only Thur night the new venue can't have 18 and up on the weekends! It's in a old strip mall now it's more like a hole in a wall not a club!,1
"Their bathroom is the filthiest I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerating. The toilet looked as if never cleaned. Same with the urinal, sink and floor. As far as the food goes what's the big deal about this place? Fries are tasteless, greasy and I suspect cooked in old oil. Burgers not made fresh, how this place wins awards is a mystery to me.",1
"Beer in a mason jar? Why yes, yes I will. The Mason has a sweet selection of taps and Sarah behind the bar is awesome. This place has zero pretension and has some nice couches and tables for loungin' around. I've walked biked by this place hundreds of times without batting an eye, but now that I know it's there I'll be back soon. Such a gem!",2
"Love this place! I ordered the chicken enchiladas on a recent trip and then went back and got them again later in the trip.the green sauce is so good! Their chips, salsas, and margaritas are all very good and the bartenders will mix you up something special if you sit at the bar and tell them what you like. A very good spot hidden by the convention center in Mandalay.",2
"Don't see what all the fuss is about. I have had better Chinese food after I nuked a frozen selection in the microwave. As for the Mongolian BBQ small selection, can't make your own sauce, and still bland. If you eat supermarket sushi, then this is the place for you. If you like fresh sushi, then leave immediately. I can sum up my review in one word, NASTY!",1
"This place is amazing. It's probably the best sushi place I've been to. The price is so cheap, which is how Asian food should be. You also get so much bang for your buck. For 5, you get 2 boxes 20 huge pieces of sushi. I'm a huge sushi lover who can't get enough, but that fills me up. I wish they had more locations or were closer to me because I'll live there. I love this place that much ",2
"I'm in Phoenix for the week on business, and was craving pho. I took a chance on this place cause it's close to my hotel and got good reviews here. Got the 1 and an order of egg rolls. The pho was top notch the egg rolls were good, but not great. I'll definitely make a point to come back while I'm here.",2
"Not really worth the money This place is pretty appealing because it is in the heart of old town scottsdale. However, the Philly cheese steak sandwiches here are just average and it is fairly overpriced. The staff there are not bad but are not really friendly or inviting. They play rock music hip hop in the restaurant which is not appealing to everyone. I dont plan on going back again.",1
The Zucca chips are delicious and it's a veggie can't loose there! The Italian Farm salad is fantastic. For an entree I highly recommend the strozzapreti. If you like Kale salads it is great here with the salmon. I admit potatoes are a weakness but their smashed potatoes not mashed but smashed are great!,2
"Laseraway is amazing! As a woman with permanently tanned skin, I was ecstatic to find a laser place that knows what they are doing! I have had amazing results! The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that at times the technicians rush through the treatments without marking the area and spots are missed. Other than that, they are great!",2
This place is just awful. Don't get me wrong the food is fine but every time I come here the food takes forever. Even if I order 30 minutes in advance the food is never ready and I have to end up waiting at least 30 minutes every darn time. The employees never know what's going on and more times thaot they'll give you attitude. Never returning.,1
We came here after reading the reviews on yelp. We were seated at a table that still had sauce and bits of food on the table. We were then reseated to another table that also had sauce on the table. All the other tables looked worse. Not speaking for their food but their cleanliness. Gross. Obviously we left since there were no clean tables.,1
"Been here many times absolutely love the food! The unlimited fresh pitas with garlic humus is excellent worth the dine in experience if u are prepared for poor service! Don't get me wrong, food is always great, but service is always poor. You can go when it's busy, when it's quiet, they always manage to forget to bring water, bills. Well worth the food! Choose take out if u want good service.",2
"Went on Thursday around 6 pm and there was hardly anyone there. The beer was cold, the guacamole burger was good but I found the rest of the food to be a little bland. There was a mistake on the order and they fixed it right away. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly. The seats tables could use some TLC. Probably would not return.",1
Ordered moon over my hammy and it was disgusting! The chef was very heavy on the salt! You caever go wrong with pancakes though! Also ordered the blueberry hushpuppy things for the first time and they were burnt. Looked nothing like the picture but then again does anything ever look like the pictures?,1
"Went here for the first time with bRUNch Running Group Phoenix for their Kick off in Pheonix. Shared the French Toast OMG! and the Beef Rib Hash Yum! with my running partner. She had the Peach Bellinni sp? and i had the Red Rooster Bloody Mary . I wasn't a Bloody Mary fan until I had the Red Rooster very tasty, spicy and delish! The food was fabulous!",2
"Great place to eat away from the strip go there early for some good food and quiet place to chat with friends, stay later and you'll get all the clubbing locals. Food is good, I just wished I didn't eat so much at the buffet, by the time I was there could really order only two dishes. Very cute waitress there. ",2
"This is the second time we eat here. Both times were for lunch. Probably one of the best buffets for the price. 18 lunch for two people. Can't beat it, especially when the food is also good. Paid 40 for a buffet at goldeugget and got sick with their crap cafeteria food. I highly recommend this place if you want a good buffet on a budget.",2
"We tried all three of their drinking chocolates and they are kind of gross. We understood the fact that they are supposed to be fairly exotic and gourmet, but they are really vile. Can't believe we have to throw out 3 boxes of incredibly expensive schlock. If you are drinking the bandwagon kool aid, I'm sure you'll love it. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Make your own with quality chocolate.",1
"Too corporate. I went once and that was enough for me. The vet with whom I met and vet assistant are more about the wellness plans rather than the care of my pet. While I believe the vets and assistants are qualified, it's all about wellness plans. I want a vet who will love and treat my animal, not just some plan to capture me as a reoccurring client.",1
This is hands down my favorite go to AYCE sushi spot in town! I've been coming here once a month for the past year and I never get tired of it. For such a busy place the service is decent and the waiters are friendly. The sushi is sooo fresh and I enjoy the large variety. If in the chinatown area definitely worth a visit.,2
"Did not like the BBQ sauce or their potato salad, don't know why it was so sweet! BBQ sauce was horrible, no real flavor! We had baby backs, nice they were cut but we're dry, dry dry! The cream corn was good and hubby liked the beans! If we go back will try something else, not crazy about how food is served or tables to eat at, if it was cheaper may put up with that but not at those prices!",1
"Fix my RV did a great job on our older Motorhome. We needed a new AC unit in the back and had to upgrade the thermostat to be able to talk to the older AC unit in the front. Lots of unknowns ran into old wiring, custom ducting, etc , but Fix My RV held to the estimate with no additional charges to fix all the items related to the age of our Motorhome. Great Service!",2
"We frequent Antonio's on a regular basis, and they are hands down the best pizza by the slice in town! They make a variety of unique and creative pizzas that are always served fresh. Spicy Beef Taco, Chicken Florentine, and Chicken, Bacon, Ranch just to name a few. My go to slice is the Chicken Quesadilla! Absolutely delish!",2
"This is a staple for Vegas locals! It is only 13 for dinner and worth every penny. We use the phrase ""Left side, strong side "" because that's the side of the buffet where the crab legs, prime rib, and desserts are on Try the cookies and cream gelato! The drawback is the long, long, long lines to get in. Get there early in the evening or be prepared to wait and then wait some more!",2
"My boyfriend took me here one day, because it's his favorite lunch place. I can see why he likes it so much. All the food is really and tastes healthy. Healthy AND good. I usually get the bento box either with steak, chicken, or salmon. The portions are huge so make sure you don't overorder. They even have this little sauce bar type area so you can make your own sauces for your food.",2
"Went in on Saturday for lunch. Customer service was pretty poor. Parking lot is not great due to ABC Store, Goodwill, and IHOP. Biggest disappointment is their delivery area does not include the neighborhoods on the west side of Lancaster Highway. It seems if you have a Pineville address, they do not want your business.",1
"I dined at Legume twice at it's new Craig location. Both times everything was well prepared, reasonably priced for the quality, and served extremely professionally. I would strongly recommend Legume especially if you are specifically looking in the area but am not able to speak as emphatically about it as many of the 5 star reviews.",2
"I came here because I was told that they stock all the ingredients to make tiramisu. Everything was overpriced, the mascarpone cheese were expired, and the cashier forgot to bag my cocoa powder! And the humus I bought was expired too! Yes, I forgot to check the expiration date on the humus, but really?",1
"My mom used to hire Snappy to mow their huge lawn when I was a kid. They really are true to their name. They would show up and do the whole job io time like a well oiled machine. I just hired them to remove a bougainvillea and clean up my patio. They showed up promptly and did the job fast for a good price. Not only that, but the patio looks great.",2
"Not happy, changed from dishnetwork to Direct TV a year ago. The person who we signed up with initally didn't tell us that after a year they jack up your pricing by almost 50! We have another year to deal with them and will be firing them as soon as we can! READ ALL FINE PRINT! We are just going to buy a kinect and get netflix. it's 100 cheaper monthly! BAD BAD BAD BUSINESS DEALINGS!",1
"I have been going to this Fry's for years and until today have not had any problems. nThe ladies at the pharmacy were rude and not helpful in refilling a prescription I have been taking for 4 years now. I will not be returning to this pharmacy, which is quite an inconvenience as it is right near my house and have been going there for years.",1
"I'm surprised this place doesn't get good reviews. I went out here for a night out in Mill with some friends and I had a lot of fun. This place attracts a very friendly crowd of college kids and young professionals. What more can you ask for a scene? You can dance anywhere you like, it's a NINERS bar I think , and it's a huge venue that's got everything you need in a bar.",2
Great selection of toppings. You serve yourself so no complaints about the service. They do promotions every once in awhile that are good. Price isn't too bad just don't let your kids pile it up too high and you'll be fine. All in all the fam and I love this place. Might go back tonight now that I'm thinking about it!,2
"Rip off. Quoted me 5900 to replace a failed A C system. I responded that's too much. The guy went on to explain that they were going to replace condenser, coil and furnace. The furnace was not failing. Without furnace their quote was 4480. Then I called the highest rated AC repair company here on Yelp and their quote was 3500.",1
"Great food and cheap everything is under 10 , the atmosphere is cool and welcoming, they have anime on the tv's of course. The lunch counter and drink bar is a cool idea. They had a sign that said liquor license pending so that will be a cool addition. Get the tuna poke salad it was good and fresh. Place is too cool to pass up, gotta say you have been there.",2
"This buffet requires that you be very selective with what you choose The salads seemed reasonably tasty and fresh and the rolls, breakfasts, and desserts are satisfactory. We were visiting the car museum, so it was natural to try to eat somewhere in the hotel. While it turned out to be a bit pricey especially for the quality of food we got overall it wasn't too bad.",1
"I loved this little salon! Groupon said it was 'intimate' and it is. She seems to be a hard working lady trying to get her salon off the ground. Kudos to her! I love the way my nails looked. Colors might be limited, but give her time. I've not had a problem with any peeling. I look forward to going again.",2
"Visited for the first time Sunday afternoon to attend their ""Chili Cookoff "". It was only 2 each to participate and try 20 different recipies. Great outdoor space with volleyball, bags, and other games, live music, grill your own food, plus the chili we voted for won the contest! I think this might end up being a regular hangout even though it is 30 min from Scottsdale.",2
"Got there when they opened for lunch, waited 40 minutes for a couple of cheeseburgers. They were cold when we finally got them. Pretty sure the coleslaw was at least a day old. Service was slow, food was bad cold. Won't be back. Too many bad factors to assume I won't have to deal with at least one of them again.",1
"best restaurant hands down, my bf mine FAV nmy bf and i have been here prob over 50 times. nwe moved back to Canada now but visit AZ every 3 months and always go at least once to the city hall mastros. nI really like the ocean club one, but my bf insists on this one. amazing food ngreat bar nwonderful service",2
"Besides having amazing tacos the ppl working here are friendly. Debit machine went down. I said I'd go get cash,they brought food out to my wife while I was gone and I made sure I went in to pay even tho they didn't sweat it. Carne asada tacos are the best. I had five like a true fatty. Great flavor.super cheap. I wanted to eat so badly I took pic half way thru. Go there and have a good time",2
"Clean, well stocked, spacious, helpful staff, lots of parking everything good, nothing bad! I just took one of their stretching classes taught by a Vegas showgirl. She's great! Also check out Radio Shopping Show, they have 1 month memberships for City Athletic for 29. Its a good way to try it out for a few weeks.",2
"Would rate it a 3, but they happen to have a local posse of TSA humanoids that are the mouthiest I've seen. Also, amazed at the amount of fucktards playing slots. Wake up. These are worse odds than Keno or the Big Wheel when you walk into a casino. Still gets stars for amenities, Starbucks, food, all the stuff you'd expect.",1
"We really got duped! It's hard for me to imagine worse food than the garbage this place is dishing out. The service was also pretty lackluster, and the atmosphere made me feel kinda sad. I understand I'm going to pay a lot more for a meal because of where I am, but I expect an attempt at quality. Whoever is responsible for this is a true scam artist.",1
"Well this is a business Costco first so, I realize it is the closest Costco to the strip and your normal Costco card will work here. It is a lot different. Hence Business Costco, however the deals as normal Costco and they do have food but, it is more focused towards restaurants and small biz. nThey do have gas here so that is good and important for you frugal Costco shoppers.",2
This is my Aunt cousin's church that they frequently regularly. I dropped in one day when I was in town. the paster is awesome! He was going over the 10 commandments and I only got the last one since I was a drop in but it was told in a new perspective which I thought was refreshing. Also the JR High youth group is VERY awesome!,2
"Always great service, lovely ambience, great wine selection, and appies that can't be beat. The bruschetta is delicious, the meat platter is divine, and the cheese plate delights my palate. Our party of 10 had a very enjoyable evening here with extremely attentive service. I can't ever say 'no' to Postino's. Ever!",2
about the buffet. we only went there because we had just arrived and were starving. over the course of the next few days we sampled many other buffets and Excalibur was definitely the worst one. Dining area was kind of dark and everything that sounded good on the menu inside or looked good when walking by turned out to be kind of a disappointment. Save your money for Bellagio's buffet.,1
"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner and I totally did not expect the ambiance that I experienced when I walked in. From the outside, it doesn't really look the way it does on the inside. It's a very relaxed, yet sophisticated setting. Some tables are sectioned off with more privacy. The food is great. I definitely recommend this place.",2
Every time this business gets bad reviews they somehow make a new account on yelp lol! This place should be called CROOKstone Dental.Con artists that shouldn't have licenses to work on even a dogs mouth. Overpriced and poor quality are two things to expect when you come to this establishment. Got a root canal and wasn't able to eat on my left side of my mouth for two years. Shut this place down!,1
"I'm surprised I hadn't yet written a review of Blue Sky! To echo everyone else, I've decided parking at the airport is less stress free than trying to get a ride. I'm paranoid about the availability and shuttle wait time of using the airports lot, so I've used Blue Sky 2 3 times so far and have had a great experience each time. I make my reservations online and the whole process is a breeze.",2
"Good food but can be pricey with small portions. Busy so hard to get service and tends to be a wait. I would pass on the Tom yum soup, but everything else we had was good garlic prawns, sea bass drunkeoodles, pad Thai, boat noodle, nam kao tod, fried banana with coconut ice cream . Seafood options usually over 20 and everything else we had was around 10.",2
"Cool hidden spot in North Scottsdale right next to the 101 tucked in a small shopping plaza. Love the dark feel on hot, sunny days. Cold beer and great service. Lots of tvs and perfect place to watch sports. Also, the relatively new menu and happy hour items are a huge improvement. Really enjoy the mussels and potato skins. Definitely worth a stop if you are nearby.",2
Toyota pavilion is a hidden gem. Under the decks you have a player entry view while having free drinks and an excellent buffet with good quality chefs. Desserts are over the top. I am amazed each event has a unique theme and a variety of dinners. Tabletops are limited. Use the player entrance to get to your seats.,2
"I am a fan of the show but would not recommend visiting the store. None of the stars were there and it looks different than on the show. You can buy sell here but the whole back of the store sells T Shirts and souvenirs. In my opinion, visiting the store changed my opinion of the actual show.in a negative way.",1
"I really enjoyed this restaurant. There are some unique menu items that I have not seen at other establishments. In fact, when I was there we ordered a roll that used noodles instead of rice, and it was yummy. There are whiteboards behind the bar with tons of daily specials. It is conveniently located near many stores, so you can work up an appetite shopping, then stop in for a bite to eat.",2
What a great little find near old Montreal. Pleasant and friendly staff who also speak English and great ambience. Their breakfast is fresh made and ample. Excellent coffee too! There are awesome sandwiches and other tasty pastries to take along as you tour the old city. I'd highly recommend this place!.,2
"This Pizza Hut SUCKS! So frustrating to be told our one pizza would take 30mins. And we actually waited an hour and a half. Then we calked to ask if the order went through ok and why it was taking so long. Only to have some rude guy tell us "" its on the way "" and hang up on us. The absolute worst experience I've had with pizza delivery. Maybe Pizza Hut isn't as great as they say they are.",1
"After reading the reviews I was excited to try Mundo. It was a monumental disappointment! I took my wife on Saturday and we were waiting at the hostess stand for almost 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Then, after being seated, my wife asked for a salad that had pomegranate and they said they were out of pomegranates. We tried to",1
"Definitely a no no. Of all the clubs I've been to, this one was the worst. My cousins and I walked in and literally walked out because it was so humid. It was like walking into a sauna. It was small and it wasn't even crowded, but it was so stuffy. I can't imagine if it was crowded. You would probably suffocate.",1
"Be aware of the following! nIf you try to use restaurant .com or groupon.the restaurant doesn't count alcohol in the total bill! nI spent 103 and they refused to allow restaurant .com Second,.if you request a song from the band? Cost you 20 bucks! nEven Happy Birthday.I tipped 5 and a band member said all requests are 20. We will not return.",1
"Typical high end steak place format. The location in City Center is unique, in the wooden ""treehouse "". nHighlights were potatoes gratin, creamed corn, and grilled asparagus. nThe bananas foster cocktail is like a rum desert. nOf course the service is upscale as expected. nI have been to Mastro's locations in Orange County and here, both were consistently good.",2
"I absolutely LOVE Bravi! After being introduced to this place, I immediately took everyone I know here. My mom is a really big fan, and she's quite a picky eater. My favorite items here are the tomato soup my personal comfort food and the turkey breast panini. The gorgonzola and pear salad is also amazing. If you want to be nice to your taste buds, go eat at Bravi!",2
Frijoles brings Mexican street food to is essentials and excels at it. A simple menu prepared with care and fresh ingredients brings out the best. The meat is cooked to order and the beans have the texture that exudes freshness. Good balance of flavored. Highly recommend. Update I ordered the frijoles and beans last night. Best beans I have ever had! Sublime.,2
"The best toppings of any yogurt place I've been to in AZ. Yogurt selections are top notch Pom rasp, cheesecake, peanut butter, etc. . The toppings include mochi, boba, fresh berries, variety of toasted nuts and hot dressings like butter pecan. It helps that the proprietor is a down to earth all around cool guy. I come here every week to get my fix and surf the web free wifi . Highly recommended.",2
"This place is just a dive.It is NOT a sports bar.Don't even bother going.It's awful.Let me also add, Saturday college football, and the 1 tv turned to golf.also, only 1 pool table.okay for a dive bar, understanding cheap drinks and all but, not a sports bar. Fun atmosphere for bikers and people that smoke weed. 2 girls smoking out back near the door.once again.not a sports bar.!",1
This was a couple of weeks ago. But I had a painful toothache it seem to come out of nowhere. I had some discomfort on Thursday and I called my dentist on a Friday just before 5 00PM and he called a prescription here for me. I picked it up an hour later and lived to see the weekend. Now the two root canals is another story.frick.,2
"Wife hurt her back at work. Came here. 45 minutes in lobby. 30 in exam room to have vitals taken. 30 for Dr. to see to see her. 30 waiting to take xrays.it went on and on. Total time here.3 and a half hours. Wifey was in terrible pain. I had to help her walk, was never offered help or a wheelchair eventhough there were many around. Fricken horrible place. Don't come here if you can avoid it.",1
"This is the best free show you can get in Vegas. Everyone must take the time to see this show at least once but I'd recommend everytime. In the later party of the afternoons, the show goes on every 30 minutes then evenings it starts every 15 minutes. If you would like a different perspective, go up to the top of the Eiffel Tower to watch. You won't regret it.",2
"Not only was there a unique selection of fun and feminine clothes at reasonable prices, but the two girls that helped us were adorable and very helpful. They brought us clothes that they thought we would like and that fit our body with a smile, making it an all around wonderful shopping experience! This store needs to open up in NYC!",2
"This is for Leo, the nicest, most generous, friendliest, waiter we've had during our weekend stay in Vegas. My friends and I have never been to this establishment until today. And our first experience was quite memorable because of him. Leo, thank you so much for making our last day in LV the best ! Food and drinks were quite tasty too might I add. I highly recommend the foot long dog !",2
"Who doesn't love fresh macarons? These are little rounds of pure, sweet goodness. My favorite is the Maple Syrup. I also love them all even the Fois Gras, which I would never eat in any other form. This is one dessert worth buying from a place that knows how to make them you really can't duplicate them at home or from a grocery store!",2
"I'm not going to get in to the various levels of inappropriate behavior that we encountered and have heard about surrounding this restaurant, but, needless to say, I won't be going back and I cannot with a good conscience write a post that does anything other than recommend the same for others. Go to Brasserie V its the same concept anyway.",1
"Okay, I admit I was dragged there the first class I'm not a 'take a class "" person, but I had to try Pilates at least once to say I did it,.! AMAZING! I seriously love this it's the perfect balance of calming and kicking ass. Gabby rocks, but I'm sure her teachers are great and as dedicated as she is. Try a class, a drop in is dirt cheap 10 20 ! all kinds of classes at all times of the day ",2
"Good place to get a quick lunch in town. Good range of paninis and toasted stuff. All very reasonably priced for the centre of town too a panini and slice of cake was only a fiver I had something with honey and walnut which was very good . nOnly gripe is that it's tiny about seven seats in total, dotted along the windows bar style.",2
"I like Alberstons for their sushi rolls, and the starbucks inside is really convenient. However, their prices are OUT of control. Get ready to spend, for the same old nregular things. I paid almost 6 for a 0.3 ounce of allspice. 6! Everything there is over priced, take an extra few miles and go to Smith's.",1
"They have an amazing Porterhouse here, great cut of meat and prepared just right. I think they fully understand the idea of med well done. I don't like my steak still having a heart beat and they got it right. This is a really classy restaurant and their sides were delicious. Stuffed baked potato.yummy!",2
"Worst service ever. I requested a quesadilla. When I asked the server what was in the quesadilla, she explained how it had beef in it. I asked if I could get it without meat. I was told no, that they would NOT. I said then I'll have to cancel my order. She rolled her eyes and stormed off! My friends and I just canceled the whole order and walked out. Many more options at the airport.",1
"A great downtown location, an appropriately sized setup in a beautiful building, a clean, modern aesthetic. Giant was obviously well funded. That's about it for the positives. If you like bitter, overpriced, pre sweetened ! 'coffee' served by an obnoxious, barely legal hipster sporting a cardigan in July, this place is for you.",1
"No! nService was fairly rude, to begin with. Then the food was just bad. I ordered the sweet pork barbacoa and, yes, it is sweet. VERY, VERY SWEET. It tasted like meat candy. Then, on the side I got a helping of hard rice. It was probably 5 10 from being fully cooked. nNo desire to come back here. Why do people love this place?",1
" 3 craps tables and 5 blackjack switch tables. 5 Single deck blackjack. Michelob Ultra and margaritas for 1. If you're not trying to gamble with big money and just want to play for fun this is the place. Located right between Harrah's and Venetian's, it feels like Downtown Vegas without traveling far down the strip. Comes along with that smokey, not well ventilated feel though.",2
"Pizza is subjective typically the best pizza you have ever had is the one you grew up with.until now. This is the best pizza I ever had. Lived in the northeast and had Italians and Greeks make pizza for me. Been to Italy. This is better. Get the spelt crust. Get the margarita pizza, or anything else on the menu. Get vino at the shop nearby an enjoy.",2
"We booked this crook and met him last June for our wedding next year and we paid 600 as downpayment for his future services. We want to schedule our so called ""free "" engagement as he personally mentioned to us this month but we can't contact him in any form phone, text, e mail . Let's bring this criminal to ""Justice "".",1
"the fall garden was absolutely gorgeous. the bellagio must spare no expense at creating such a lovely scene. there are enormous pumpkins, huge apples made out of flowers, a talking tree, a giant cornucopia, and a water mill. it is just so damn pretty. it's relaxing if you block out the crowds and just so nice. i hear the winter garden is just as remarkable.",2
This place has taken a complete 180. Used to be really good and had a wonderful wait staff. It is now terribly inconsistent in food preparation and quality. The new wait staff sum up as just plain horrible! I just picked up a to go order that was missing items and was made completely different than the last time. That will be my last meal at that place. I give them 6 months and they will be gone!,1
"I LOVED this place! I walked in and thought to myself, WOW this is what a nightclub is SUPPOSED to look like! Drinks are hyper expensive! 19 for a redbull vodka is nuts! Ladies, use your feminine wiles to get some free drinks! Music was okay.with a HUGE variety. Still, it's a gorgeous venue with a great vibe! Expect it to be CROWDED!",2
"Went to NoRTH yesterday with friends for happy hour. This place is great. Half price drinks appetizers. Their yucca chips are totally additive and the angus burger for 5 w garlic fries is one of the best burgers around. Our server, Ivan, was terrific. Very attentive and funny. nAll around a great place to hang out and enjoy good friends and good food.",2
"we've heard a lot about this place, and finally went there, and it kind of sucked. hardly any sauces, and it's totally ugly inside. also, i'm not sure if the girl working at the front is even old enough to avoid child labor laws. their pineapple was bad. lai lai is way better, and so is genghis grill. avoid this place.",1
"Since the Keg had an hour wait and I was with 2 grown men who were hungry, we came to Vieux Port instead. Our waiter was too proud to be serving us, I really don't know how to say it, he never looked us while taking our order and was annoyed that we were even there! My salmon was well cooked, but extremely blend, my fiance's steak was apparently perfectly cooked.",1
"Large store with variety but I can get that at another location as well. This one has very poor customer service. Long time at cashier check out given there's usually just one counter open. nSales people on the floor are hard to find coz there are very few o one really seemed enthusiastic or smiling enough , overall very dull atmosphere for both kids and parents!",1
"If I could no stars I would. We Wanted to try out the new local Zipps but were sadly disappointed. We were seated quickly and just sat there for 16 minutes without a single server to even take stop by with a simple ""I'll be right with you "". The table next to us had been could tell of our frustration and the gentlemen said they ordered burgers 45 minutes ago and still hadn't received them.",1
Just Love Arizona Wholesale Bikes. I recently returned to the store 3 months after my purchase and there was no problem getting my ajustments made. It was done in a timely matter and no charge. I did buy the LED lights and am so happy I came back for them. Thanks for the great service and keep up the good work.,2
This is the best wine bar I have yet to visit. They have 160 wines by the glass! Is there really anything else to say? Love the concept of choosing which wine and size you would like. The only negative I can think of is the prepaid card you load with money for the machines. We didn't spend all of our prepaid amount so it will sit there until our next visit but it will not go to waste.,2
Great selection of cigars! It is bar far the best tinder box in the Charlotte! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and is always extreamily helpful! When you walk in you are always welcomed and the layout os great. n They also have a small smoking lounge in the back which is always nice! This is my go to cigar shop in Charlotte!,2
"I love breakfast. I love eggs. This place has probably the lowest quality mass production factory eggs Ive ever had. I ordered the ""portuguese sausage "" plate it definitely was not portuguese sausage. Very low quality, super greasy tastes nothing like the real thing. The couple stars are only because our waitress was very nice timely, and their potatoes are seasoned cooked pretty well.",1
"I am vegetarian but I think anyone could enjoy this place. It is tasty! We were pleased with everything we ordered. I found the Exquisite Curry to be fantastic but really, everything I tasted was very good. The menu is exciting and I can't wait to try more. The service was sweet and I loved the Happy Go Lucky drink. I look forward to going back! I'd eat there a lot if it was closer to me.",2
"Only reason i came here was because I was staying at Cesars and the meal was comped. It was nearly empty when we went for dinner.goes to show you it is not a very popular spot. The service was good but the prices if i had to pay were VERY overpriced and SMALL portions! Honestly, i could have gotten more food and better prices at Pf Changs. Sorry would never come back here again.",1
"I was so excited to finally find somewhere on this side of town I could run to for lunch. The menu is basically split in half a skinny side and a fat side. I've tried several things from both and have not been disappointed yet! If you try to get in here M F betweeoon and 2ish, be prepared to wait. It's a very small little place with extremely limited seating. Definitely worth trying out tho!",2
"AJ from Streak Patrol came and cleaned our windows inside and out. We found AJ to be a very honest, hardworking guy. Very pleasant to deal with. His prices are more then reasonable! His showed up early for the job and worked nonstop until the work was done. Our windows look awesome! We were so pleased with his work we had AJ set us up on a quarterly schedule! Thank you, AJ!",2
"Horrible experience! After waiting an hour I got a cold pizza delivered to me! Best of all it had no sauce! Didn't want to wait so just got jimmy johns next door! Called the manager, Denice to explain frustration of what transpired the previous day only to be told to argue with the rude manager. This place sucks!",1
"I came here on 2 different timings during Christmas time and in August. I totally recommend the Christmas timing when is anything never spectacular during Christmas? . The whole garden is basically filled with roses. It's amazing. During August, it's a totally different story it had a ferris wheel and a Route 66 theme.",2
"The nachos at margaritaville are one of the most enjoyable things about vegas. As a late night snack they are one of the best things you can get. And the margarita choices and other drink concoctions are outstanding. Always love coming here, and the live rock music is a nice touch. Overall reasonably priced food and drinks, and real chill setting to just have a good laid back time.",2
"Very crowdy during the lunch time. Choose other eating hours, otherwise you will have to share your table with strangers. nGood food. Amazing asian fragrances. Look for the best recipes on the wall board. nThe fried ice cream is mandatory. The service could be better, the waitreses are always in a hurry and don't have time to explain the menu. The prices are really good for the portions the offer.",2
I go at least 1 every 2 weeks. I LOVE THIS PLACE. I am addicted to there Jakarta Fried Rice. I always look for it when I go to other places but they don't have it. If they do have it they don't come close to Cravings' version. Their menu is really big. Everything that I have tried I liked. I like that people speak Chinese it gives it an authentic feel.,2
"This is my 3rd cirque du soleil. Wholesome, enjoyable show especially if you are a big fan of the beatles. Very good presentation and sequencing of the production but lesser laugh and acrobatics than mystere. My seat was close to the stage cause i got a discounted deal online but i believe every seat is a good seat so dont spend too much on the tickets.",2
"The food's taste is never consistent. They never follow instructions. nIf you ask for your food to be spicy number 8, some days it will be too spicy or for the most part it's not spicy at all. For the , they be able to deliver consistency in their food and make it the right way. Over priced for nothing! Definitely not fine dinning. Even though they try to be.",1
"Barros pizza is average. However, this review is about the kid unfriendlyness of Barros no kid menu? really? and the sloppiness of this particular Barros and its number of dirty and unbussed tables. The highchairs were disgusting and the staff seemed only to care about takeout pizza. I wont be back.",1
"The Holy Grail of children's libraries. They have separate areas for children and teens, daily gaming, a recording studio, and they also have a deal with the Children's Theatre so the preform plays there and have theatre classes. Bring your parking ticket from the deck you park in to get it validated!",2
"This, my friends, is where you take a woman if you're hoping for a second date. And a third. etc. This place is pricey, yes. Its worth every penny. I had a wine there and I've never been able to find again. Its a sparkling white with definite sweet pear overtones. If anyone can help, please please write me.",2
This was one of the better shows I saw in Vegas. I did the yelpon so I got a pretty good discount. For a good laugh a little mystery and inexpensive price tag I had a great experience. The show is suitable for both young and old. Mac King has the knack to entertain. Definitely check the show out when you can.,2
"Walked in the door, my phone reading 856p and we were turned away stating they were closed. Really? Sign said they serving at 9p. Other tables with menus in hand and they were willing to let us walk. We will never be back. As I write this review my car reads 858p. Poor customer service in full display!",1
"Worst service and mediocre food. After being seated, we waited over an hour and waitress never came back to take our order. We had to ask another waitress to serve us and might I add that this place was empty for a Saturday night. I will NEVER come back! Also, the food taste like it was warmed up in the microwave. Avoid Gallagher's at all costs!",1
"Worst Dr. I have EVER been to! He is very degrading and said horrible things to me. He acted like I didn't know anything and tried to pin my sweet husband against me. He is a creep! Stay away from this office! It is nasty, old, dirty, and the Dr. and staff is just terrible! I walked out of my appointment because I didn't deserve such horrific things said about me. DO NOT GO!",1
"Food was decent but service was really slow and there were only one other table who had already finished eating. While everyone got their food, two did not and did not receive their food until everyone was done. The table next to us was extremely loud, in a small area only to discover it was either the owner or manager. Don't think we will return.",1
"I've been to this Denny's a couple of times and its been consistently just OK. The staff is a bit frazzled during busy times so double check your order and be prepared for stuff missing. The food is Denny's, what can I say. Its filling inexpensive and if u become a member you get 20 off coupons regularly. So that's good. Really, its a diner.I've been to better.I've been to worse.have at!",1
"The Good 1.75 per item tapas menu of dips, cheeses, and meets. Gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian options. The Bad The food was ok but the service and atmosphere are seriously lacking. Very slow server. Would have given the place 3 stars if I didn't fall asleep at the table waiting for my bill What it comes down to is that there is nothing that this place does any better than a Pita Jungle.",1
"Went on a random bar hop one night, stumbled upon this place. .Lets fast forward. The bartender was wearing flip flops, they were out of every kind of vodka that I ordered, and the staff was just clueless. A bunch of girls trying to look good for money, lacked really any kind of brains. I hate being that girl, but this place is just a trashy dive for washed up men.",1
"Still trying to search for a Chinese go to place near my new house. Tried Baoding which was the blandest Chinese food ever made. Tried Dragonfly got the General Gao Chicken, veggie lo mein, and steamed dumplings. They were all just mediocre, nothing worth trying again. Still on the hunt for my go to place.",1
"Ordered ""the original "" w jalape u00f1os 10! Not even a combo. Only ate half. It was filling but is the taste quality worth the money? Nope. I'm assuming it has to do with location. nThe look of the pizza was not appetizing. The cheese looked dry which is one of the reasons I didn't order it. nThe inside was clean organized so I appreciated that!",1
"Well, Kevin A. pretty much summed it up in his review new, clean, friendly and very good food! I meant to snap pics of my spicy 4 5, so good basil chicken and whatnot, but I was too hungry. Mango sticky rice was addictive! They have a drive thru and the menu says they deliver. Since I live really close, I walked and did takeout. Everything was cooked fresh and was ready to go within 10 minutes.",2
"PF Chang's is usually a great place to go with quality friends and enjoy as delicious meal. The location, as stated by Penny Lane, has the worst service. We ate in the bar, and while waiting 30 minutes for our entrees, we witnessed a BF by the bar tender and four tables come and go around us. Our food was cold and the sauces were congealed. ",1
"Driver arrived early and beat me to the train station. Car was clean and comfy. The driver was friendly throughout the ride but also let me just chill out when I stopped talking. He even added the nice touch of handing me a bottle of Fiji water for the ride. All in all, great service! I recommend it.",2
"I stop in to Tuvalu once a week for some hot coffee and a delicious bacon breakfast burrito. Served with a side of salsa, this little gem is a great way to start the day! I usually enjoy my breakfast and drinking a bottomless cup of joe Friday mornings when I can read the newest addition of the Isthmus.",2
"We decided to try this place one more time. No one to greet us except for a strong fishy smell. We had the chicken, cheese and bean pupusas. The food was ok, but nothing special. Our server did not come by and offer to refill drinks. Overall cleanliness was okay. We were not impressed, so we won't return here for awhile.",1
"This place has a reputation for hiring only douchebags for waiters and they totally lived up to it. I wish I could tell you about the food but after almost an hour without getting any, we decided to leave. I don't think that a restaurant concept of rude service is a good one. Good service is important and this place totally failed on it.",1
"I've been going here since 2005 and it hasn't changed a bit! The staff is friendly, but seem kind of shy. The food is always great and for the price, can't beat that. So much better than Filberto's. And it's super clean. Thanks for such a great little Mexican joint! The only request I have is you should add Al Pastor to your menu ",2
My wife and I have been driving all the way from Litchfield Park and West Peoria for several years going to this restaurant. We have never had a bad experience and we are absolutely in love with their weekend buffet. The naan is fantastic and my personal favorite dish is the Palak Aloo. Who knew spinach could be so good?,2
"Smells like sugar in this place. I love adore frosting, but had to force myself to finish the amount on the red velvet cupcake. Yes, it was sweetly delicious, but my teeth literally ached from it. The cupcake itself was pretty dry. Like someone else said, I had to lay the cupcake down sideways to eat it due to the top heavy frosting. Just too much.",1
"My first visit was excellent. Had the Ahogada torta.A .and biztec burrito with green sauce which I enjoyed the most. Great prices and great service also! We ended up here since our orig destination Mucho Macho Tacos isn't open yet. Glad I discovered this place. I will be back! The plaza is sketchy but so what who cares? BTW, MMT opens 8 26.previously Taco Attoyac in Glendale.",2
"Horrible!ordered a chicken ceasar on my lunch. Took 20 min for a salad and when it came there is nothing but some nasty ass jerk chicken which consisted of all brown meat. Chickens have white meat and this salad consisted of only ONLY gross dark meat chicken. Yelp you let me down on this one , I was looking the previous place funky food which is STILL listed. DO NOT TRY!",1
"I am right there with Karen. I came in today just to get a coffee and, although I was the only person ordering, I had to wait for more than 5min for my coffee. Worse than that was the attitude of the barista rolling her eyes and seeing 4 other drinks being served to other customers before me even though I ordered first. Sorry, not coming back.",1
"Omg, I love this place! They have the cutest little things, I swear. All from japan too! They have a domo section! Pokemon galore! Mario, final fantasy, everything a japanaphile could ask for! Their snack section in the back of the store is also a real treat! I LOVE TOKYO DISCOUNT! The only downside is, you cannot go here without buying something! Everything is just so cute!",2
"This place was top notch. We came to Vegas for the weekend and ended up eating here twice. The chorizo nachos were amazing, and the turkey burger was up there with the best burgers I have ever had, so juicy and full of flavor, not to mention GIANT. Love this place. It is unique and really holds it's own out on the strip next to the other big time chefs' restaurants.",2
"Just ate there and the experience was lacking nEggs over medium still has runny whites. nPancakes tasted like bleach nWater tasted like the sewer nTable was dirty .we asked waitress to clean it but she never did nWaitress was unfriendly and not helpful nNever got any drink refills nSorry, but I would not recommend this place",1
Today I ran in for butter.reminded me of every other time I've ever run in there for something. They're never stocked to handle traffic because they are accustomed to having none. I guess it's nice that they keep the doors open but it's pretty much a waste of time running in there better call first.,1
"I didn't get to go to the Pink's in LA during my short stint in Lala land, so Hubby and I decided to try it when we were in Vegas. Disappointed. 1 No indoor seating, which meant eating outside in the blazing humid heat 2 Hot dogs were. just like any other hot dog. Their ""extra "" toppings weren't that good 3 Chili was bland and blah Don't go here. just go inside and eat at Earl's. You'll thank me!",1
"I was visiting Vegas with some friends when I checked this place out. I've been to quite a few go karting places and this was one of the worst. The track is too small for 12 13 karts at the same time. Also, the race managers are not consistent about who they stop for crashing into other karts or the walls.it seems that ""regulars "" get the preference. Give this place a miss.",1
"My family of six and I celebrated a grandson's birthday and Chevys was his choice for tonight's dinner. Everything was perfect, the food was great, came out of the kitchen hot and fresh. Maria, our waitress stayed with us and made sure that we were well taken care of. I love this place.! They have to best chips and salsa anywhere.",2
"There are two holiday inn in Edinburgh. Holiday inn at queensferry road is not bad. But service is not so good considering price. Moreover breakfast and wifi is not included. Food is very slow at lunch and dinner. One thing good is to use two devices if you use wifi. Last, downtown is not far about 8 pound distance by taxi .",1
"Great Maki sushi, the rolls are very tasty and the portions are generous. Some place you have to get 3 rolls to fill up, here I would say just 2. Miso is decent, and the atmosphere is energetic. I am not a huge fan of Sashimi so I am not sure of their selection in that area. Happy Hour is a good deal here.",2
I've come here a couple times now and the quality of service and food has steadily declined. Had the famed breakfast burrito finally. It was charred beyond recognition and when I went to return it and I was treated horribly by the girl in the front. Not coming again. This is no longer my favorite taco shop.,1
"This place has the weirdest fish tacos I've ever had. they were good. The grilled cod was ground up and mixed with cilantro and green onions kind of like taco meat . It was well spiced and pretty good. Other than that, the most remarkable thing about this place is how long it has survived downtown. It's fine in a pinch, but definitely not a destination.",1
"If you want to take the Family to Vegas this is the place. The family package that includes 2 nights stay for 2 kids and 2 adults, including 4 movie theater passes, 4 bowling passes, buffet credit is a good deal. It works out for everyone, kids have a good time and parents do some gambling.everyone wins. The only downside is that it's about 20 min away from the strip. Other than that its great.",2
Love there food and friendly staff. nTried something new today. shrimp scallops in their peanut sauce with noodles and it was good. I like that the shrimp and scallops were big and not baby ones like other places. nWe try to go for lunch at least once a week cause they have great lunch specials but today we order from their dinner menu to try something different.,2
They make nice stuff but it's not amazing. They have a lot of hidden costs such as 7 because you didn't buy the shirt there. They claim are a set up fee but things are all done on the computer. 7 to type?! When it's all said and done you have paid for 2 of work and 14 of fees. I'll gladly take my business elsewhere.,1
"I had my hair done with David and Frank when they were at EA Red Door Salon and Spa so when they decided to open their own place on Scottsdale Rd I wanted to follow them. Let me just say that they are both terrific! Their knowledge of color, cut, and style is updated and done to perfection. They are great conversationalists and I wish them all the best as they continue to build their new salon.",2
"The food here was great. We ordered an appetizer of sweet potato fries a with spicy pepper dusting a wedge salad and each of us ordered a burger. The problem was that the fries and salad were served nat the same time and we weren't one third done with those when our burgers arrived. That said, the food would bring me back again.",2
"I was in Vegas for my anniversary and decided to try this place. Overall, I had a great experience here. The food was awesome! I was on a mission to find the best Thai Beef Salad and I think I found it here! The service was phenomenal. If you ever go to Las Vegas and want to dine away from Strip, this is the place to go.",2
"So what if this place has been around for a while. The food is terrible. The only ""logical "" reason for coming here is if you are ridiculously wasted. And I don't mean drunk, I mean you forgot your name and you are feeling pretty hungry, so you stumble in. Other than that, there is no excuse for eating here. You are simply wasting your money.",1
"Monotronics is the worst company I've had the displeasure to do business with. I've been trying to cancel my account since APRIL it's now NOVEMBER. They refuse to cancel, keep giving me the run around to fax, mail, claim we authorized them to continue the contract verbally, which they will accept and have continued to charge me for services that I'm not receiving. DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THEM!",1
"Definitely some of the tastiest sushi I've had in the valley. The place is a bit small, so if you don't like waiting it's better to arrive earlier. And it's best not to come in a party larger than four. I've witnessed many people and large groups waiting for a LONG time outside during dinner time. The AYCE is a good deal here. A wide variety of many tasty dishes.",2
"Quiet and mellow location. Great for work study. There is an outlet with 6 adapters in the corner of the store.The sofa chairs and one table have easy access to it. If you have a long cord, other tables can reach it as well. At the other end of the store, there is a table with an outlet. Staff seem friendly and there is plenty of parking.",2
"The manager of this store should pay attention this kind of attitude. nTheir meats are good, so I go there. One star rating is for last visit only. nThis cashier didn't say hi or thank you. What kind of sales person is that? nThey don't have to be overly friendly, but they should at least say thank you.",1
"We spent 5000 on a TV, surround sound, blue ray, and wall mount. The sales person told us the old wall mount would not work. It actually did. We came back to return wall mount and buy a new kitchen table only to find out there was a restocking fee of 15 for the wall mount. Needless to say they would not accommodate us. Taking our business elsewhere.",1
"01 31 10 Thought I'd update w newer pics. Weekends pack in the multi cultural families that live in the area. Love how it's a lot emptier during the week. Nightfall brings shadier looking individuals, however, and I'm less likely to stay past dusk BTW, there is an area w in the park that I believe was poorly planned. I hope that city park officials see to its amendment soon.",2
The service has plummeted each time I've been while trying to remain a loyal customer must admit I love the Tostado's . This was my last and final visit because my server was terrible and the manager lack of caring sealed this chapter for me. I contacted the corporate office and I was called and received a sincere earnest apology. Apology accepted but the place is off my list when visiting Vegas.,1
"Great food, reasonable prices, good service. Crawfish and shrimp by the pound. Three sauces as I recall with three heat levels for each. I had the signature ""Hot Juicy "" sauce, but got mild because I was not alone. On my own I'd probably get medium. Great flavor. Be ready to get messy. They provide paper towels and bibs.you'll need them. This is on my list anytime I return to Vegas.",2
"I'm not sure if it was just the day, maybe there were a lot of flight delays or something, but the last time I connected here, this airport was a disaster. It was outright dirty, trash everywhere. not enough seating so people were sprawled all over the place. I think this airport should definitely be a lot bigger, Vegas is super busy and isn't going anywhere.",1
"My first visit I tried the Chicken Tikka Masala and I wasn't a big fan but my friend got the Chicken Tikka and it was AWESOME, the best I have every had. So I went back today and this time I got the Boneless Chicken Handi and it was really great. The naan bread is also excellent. A lot of my friends like the Bryiani quite a lot.",2
"Blech. Go to the Piglet instead. The bigger Blind Pig location is crowded, dark and full of hipsters. The beer selection is okay, but not great, and if you prefer spirits I'm a bourbon drinker go to Seven Saints or Boltini. Hell, the cider selection is even weak they have like two or three bottles and occasionally one draft.",1
"Positively transcendent. I've seen hundreds of shows, and this is near the top. Aside from the lame ish crowd, this is almost certainly the best way to spend a night in Las Vegas. Even those who are not fans of the Beatles or Cheap Trick should be able to enjoy the sheer technical brilliance of the performance. Perfect in every important way.",2
"The view is nice. Food was terrible. When we called they made a point to tell us there was a dress code, so we dressed for the occasion. The bar above us had locals in concert t shirts and flip flops hanging over the railing above us. 200 for dinner and the food was really bad. Not worth the price or the effort getting dressed up.",1
"Horrible bloody mary too much spice to drink and I asked for it to be mild . Lettuce wraps were bland with dry chicken and the chicken sandwich was dry and tasted microwaved. Bar tender talked too much, was slow and obnoxious. Wasn't crowded so they can't use that as an excuse . There was just nothing good to recommend about this spot.",1
"The Chicken Pho was good, but not great. My girlfriend had the beef and meatball Pho. It was kind of bland and she had to add a bunch of salt. Service was good up to the point of our waitress getting off for the day. After that we did not get any service except for the bill. Still looking for a great Pho restaurant.",1
"Fish broth soup with fish flavored bean curd and tendon. Broth OK but nothing special. I do like the fact that they don't use MSG. Hardly any tendon, and what there was of it was not at all good. Didn't taste any of that fish flavor in the bean c. It's not as bad as a 2 sounds.more like a 21 2, but there's a lot of competition around here.",1
"Service sucked, waitresess acted like they hated life and people. Went there to watch ufc and have to download an app and listen to with headphones. Volume was super low from app it was super cheesy. Worst service ever! Waitress came around ever 15 minutes and i asked for ketchup and ranch and 20 minutes later she brought it. Smh",1
"I really love this place. Red Robin alone is a good place to eat, but the service here is great too not always easy to find. We were seated promptly, brought drinks promptly and our orders were on point. Nothing was amiss and the services was very friendly. For the price, this is a good place to go.",2
"Best Italian food in town! I love this place. Everything about it was great the family style ma and pop feeling of it, and the service and food. I would come back just for the server we had and I told her and her manager just that! I HIGHLY recommend this eatery. The other great thing about it is that it's gluten friendly, and still incredibly delicious!",2
"Very good Q. Generous portion. Collards are worth getting. Service was super. Asked for outside cut and they said they could not accomodate that request but it came about half and half which was perfect anyway. Have to go back and try the ribs. They looked great. Worth the drive. Parking can be a challenge at lunch rush hour, so arrive before or after the peak.",2
"We came here for a quick bit. I was not impressed at all. The food was fancy American fare, but was only ok. The drinks were off. The menu was big, maybe there are just too many items for them to be good at something. It was an ok dinner, but I just don't think why I would come back. It was not cheap also.",1
This is my favorite Einsteins in Vegas. The crew has their stuff together and manage to fill orders and serve food in record time. They're friendly to boot! My main reason for not visiting the one closer to my work is becuase of the time iit takes to order and recieve it. This one has employees that understand the sense of urgency I'm in when I drop by on my way to work.,2
"This is a very intimate dive bar and the flavors are BIG! I could have used a few more beer selections, but the local beer they did have on hand fit my fancy quit well! Food comes out fast and the beer comes out cold. Great spot to go to lunch and socialize with the other locals that have found this place! I will be back!",2
"I have never been to a strip show before, but being my first time it was great. The music was really good, overall a very entertaining show. I would have wished Holly would have done more then her little parts she has in it, but the rest of the cast was great. I would definently recommend to go and see it.",2
"By far my favorite crap hole in Scottsdale. Can't beat the price to booze ratio. The clientele will always make you feel more sober than the guy next to you, which can be comforting at times. They just started ""Elvis at Noon "" on Wednesday night. It is awesome! GO GO GO. just don't go on a weekend night. Don't go anywhere in Scottsdale on a weekend night. Mwah hahaha",2
"I only use the ATM at this branch. I have had bankers open accounts in the past without my knowledge and when I asked for the District Managers phone number, I was given an assistants name and number under the impression that she was the DM. I understand bankers need to make their numbers but opening accounts without a customers consent so that you can make your ""numbers "" is illegal.",1
"5 stars for the Blueberry Oat Bar extremely delicious! n4 stars for the customer service despite a long line, it went very quick and staff was friendly. n3 stars for the chai latte it was luke warm and I didn't really like the taste of it, despite the fact that I LOVE chai teas elsewhere. Based on other reviews and that delicious oat bar! will be back to try other options.",2
"Great beer selection, mediocre food. The mussels mariniere with pommes frites is generously portioned and one of the better items on the menu. The best part about Le Fripon would have to be their outdoor seating they have a terrace right along Place Jacques Cartier, which is perfect for people watching.",1
"Coffee has went down. No big deal anymore. They used to also have a good sweet selection. Got a chocolate chip cookie which cost over 2 and it was as thin as a mint, and no bigger than a chip ahoy. Also got a scone which used to be very good. Now they come in a plastic wrap, individually wrapped. That means mass produced and not local anymore. Tasted like one you get at Fry's. 10 for this garbage.",1
"This is like a fresh, healthy Asian Chipotle. The ingredients are fresh and good looking, the sauces have lots of flavor, and the shrimp are enormous you get 4 in the shrimp bowl . The place is spacious, with spare Asian decor. The process is quick, the results are head and shoulders above fast food, and the service is super pleasant. A perfect quick meal between activities. We'll be back.",2
"I made it back here about two weeks ago. I must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of July. Whether or not it was an off night I do not know, but the place was loud and crowded, the service was bad, and the food was mediocre at best. I should have just waited it out at Point Brugge. I won't becoming back anytime soon.",1
"I really wanted to like this restaurant, but I could not. nI had an 8 15 reservation with clients and we were not seated until 8 45. nThe steak bone in ribeye was so tough we had to send it back. nThe Cesar salad was very skimpy and very overpriced. The sides were nothing special. nThere are so many great steak places in Las Vegas there is no need to go back to this one.",1
"way too expensive. i bought my 8 weave leather couch here. my wooden desk, my 50 "" tv and my 2 end tables here. it was across the street from where i lived, tho. service was nice. Alot of people in line for returns and delivery stuff. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE PRICE. and i bought my comfy desk jaguar chair here",1
"This place is a joke. I don't know who is so dumb that they pay these prices. Even with a builder discount, you can do much better elsewhere. Their in store selections are pretty much limited to brown and bronze. Stay at home. Use the web. Buy online at a lower price. If you want to see a light in person, call first because they probably won't have it in the store.",1
"I heard about this Halal Thai Restaurant from a gd friend of mine Jihan. We were there last weekend for lunch. Mum had the best time of her life eating halal dishes. Finally, halal thai food. We were very happy with the taste, the ambience, the server Mariam Chef Sakina. Alhamdullilah. Thank you. We will be back soon. Check out the photos I posted on yelp. Enjoy. ",2
"This place is a great lunch spot! The soup and salad buffet that's included with lunch is small but you don't come here for that anyway. The meals are made with fresh ingredients, deliciously seasoned, with nice side features that are unexpected for a lunch under 10. I've had the Pad Khing Sod cause I'm a sucker for ginger but I've got my eye on that one with the kaffir lime leaves.",2
"What a disappointment. Saw on facebook that their fall produce stand was now open. Arrived to a few buckets of greens, one box of potatoes, pumpkins and jars of salsa, butters and a few other things. No one so much as greeted us or tried to assist us. We could not have purchased anything even if we had wanted to.",1
"I've been here three or four times when I was in Vegas and this last time I was sober. Eating there sober was a very rude awakening! I had told my friends we had to come here because the atmosphere was fun and the food was decent. I think I must have just been hammered before. The food was awful and way overpriced. With a million different places to go in Vegas, I will never come here again.",1
"I recommend these guys. Called them after searching Yelp for a company to repair the garage door on a rental we own. Response time was quick, within an hour or two and they had the door opener repaired io time for a decent price. I will be using them for any other garage door needs that I have in the future.",2
"My new favorite spot. The employee is really nice and friendly. This was the first salon I seen using liners for the spa on each clients. It's really classy and the atmosphere was comfortable. Everyone made me feel like I belong there. Beside all the construction going on. new manager It's a place to be! I'm coming here more often! nThey accept credit card, but bring cash for tips ",2
I eat here so much because it's right there has huge portions that I can save for later to eat. Take out portion are good too. I call in for take out cause sometimes there is a wait. I normally like the salmon piccata but lately the salmon is cover cooked. Dunno if they changed the chef or what but I haven't been happy.,2
"Very nice swim school, for 20 a class with the possibility of more classes for free it is a fair deal. The instructors seam informed and good with the kids. One draw back would be the assembly line style of getting the kids in and out of their ""swimming chamber, "" but I'm sure this keeps thing efficient and orderly for management.",2
This place is like a secret or something. As I was walking down St Catherine St 5 people stopped me to ask me where this underground city is. Underground City? I want to go check it out! Its basically a mall with a subway. Its cool! I came here everyday just for the Paysane Gelato that they have here. They earn 1 extra star for that. Its good!,2
"Dirty floors, standing water in the bathroom, 3 hours wait time and only 5 people ahead of me. When I asked how long it would take after sitting in an exam room for 30 minutes, the nurse was trying to tell me how busy they were and so on. 5 people in 3 hours, horrible! Don't go here! I only seen a PA not even a doctor.",1
"We went there for a surprise birthday party and were about 20 people. It was a great night. The service was fast, food was good, so was beer. We got 2 special house shots after 10 PM and a bottle of something for free because we were more than 20 people. All in all a really fuight. I have to go back though to try other things on their menu. We had the wings hot and they were awesome.",2
i love Lombardi's! their food is amazing and they have very good service. i was waited by someone named Cesar and he was very nice and checked on us all the time and we always had our food warm and our drinks were never empty! i cant wait to go back and eat their delicious food and enjoy of their great service.,2
"Yuck! This place has gone downhill. I ordered a salad with roasted chicken and asked for red onion. He said they didn't have any?! Your a burger bar, really? My salad's chicken was soooo dried out. Embarrassing! French fries horrible tasted like doughnuts and burger my hubby ordered was overlooked. I am never going back.",1
I've had Rosatis before and the food is OK in my opinion. I think they are a little over priced. I had it delivered so I can't comment on the restaurant. The food was delivered fast. I ordered a Connolly and thought it was OK nothing special but the fish and chips where good. Overall I would try them again but not my first choice.,1
"One star is one too many. I have never dealt with such pushy, RUDE, manipulative people. They literally, I kid you not, will deny you service if you don't upgrade to their bullcrap detail package. Their manager doesn't give a rats as either. Worst service I have ever received from a business. Just go to cobblestone down the street, wayyyy better.",1
"Ugh! Ghetto! 0 stars if I could! How does a place like this stay open! I mean its outrageously priced,dirty as hell , produce meat is poor quality and it is located in the scruviest place with more homeless people harassing you in the parking lot than anywhere I've ever been in Las Vegas. The Von's gas station ain' t bad but for groceries there's an Albertson's or Smith's down the street!",1
"I ordered my second Grey Goose Vodka martini.clearly it was the WELL vodka.when I brought it to their attn, they treated me like I was a rookie vokda drinker.I have been drinking good vodka longer than Jen, the bartender has been alive.nice sassy additude Jen.sub par service .again! nNext time, I will not let clients choose the location!",1
"If you're walking around NoDa shopping or checking out a gallery crawl, you must stop at The Boulevard. It's a cool showcase of amazing work by several artists. You could spend a long time there checking out all the paintings, jewelry, clothing, glasswork and other items. The work for sale ranges from cheaper, small items to high priced artwork and that variety is very nice.",2
"Goyemon is still my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in town. Their specials have been better and better each time we come and AYCE dessert is icing on the cake. The wait is really long most nights, so we have made it a point to go at the beginning of the dinner shift to decrease our chance of a long wait.",2
"I have been to this place four times now. I am absolutely IN LOVE with their quality, atmosphere, and ingredients. I get the Beach House every time. The consistency of this place is amazing! ALWAYS perfect burgers, delicious chile on top, and amazing jalapeno ranch to go with it. Even the fries are incredible! I would recommend this place to ANYONE, ANYTIME.",2
Maybe they make great burgers but we can't recommend it for drinks and munchies. The atmosphere combines the sterility of a Formica covered Greek diner with the snootiness of haute cuisine. Our waitress seemed put out by our presence when we stopped in for drinks on a Saturday night. Didn't care for the buffalo chips. Onion rings were fine.,1
I've been to this Rubio's several times and never had a bad experience. This time I tried the pan seared shrimp enchilada combo. It was delicious. Usually I have the 2 fish taco especial plate. So far I've only had seafood entrees and they've all been great. The staff is always very friendly. I just wish they were open later.,2
"Fun experience, but when you come with an organization that walks the field prior to the game they make you stand behind the stadium in a smelly ramp by the trash dumpsters in the sun, in Arizona for about 15 minutes. I've done this twice, once when it was 110 and once when it was 95. What are they thinking?",1
The music was good. The star wars show was pretty cool. a show they put on when they bring ya your bottle . besides that this place is to small. I've been to better Night clubs here in central california.For being a club in Vegas this place sucks.Well I guess I remember where I was at on my 30th birthday.,1
We came here 1x so this is based on our first experience the food was fresh and they gave lots of food we were able to share 2 plates of 2 choices with 3 adults and 1 child. It was clean and close to our new home . We just moved from Hawaii and we go to alot of panda express and this was the first Panda that I enjoyed.,2
"Great food, wonderful lighting, gorgeous huge outdoor patio, fantastic brunch, and one of my favorite places to take out of towners. Great for groups, and a perfect ""you just can't go wrong "" restaurant. Literally, date, folks in town, girls brunch, afternoon happy hour with the kids, you name it, this place will do it perfectly!",2
"This has to be one of the worst post offices I've been to. With only one or two windows open, the lines and wait time are unnecessarily long. The attitudes of the clerks range from rude to dry and service is not efficient. I wasted 30 minutes of life waiting in line yesterday because there was only one clerk. The best thing I did was just to walk out instead of wasting more of my time.",1
"Okay, I admit it. I only came over to this place because of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. and it's not a bar anymore. There's no gorilla, and even ether won't make it better. But sometimes you have to pay homage even if there's nothing left except a slow, sad rotation. And it's not like you're hurting if you want to drink in Circus 2.",1
I have been to Starbucks stores all over the world. I think out of all the Starbucks this one is one of the worst. They take forever to do anything. It took them 10 minutes to get make my drink and I was one of the only people in the store. The staff is rude! I have been completely unimpressed by this Starbucks!,1
"This is my new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! It's located in Shadyside, on a side street, downstairs. I was really surprised by how good the food was. I love the ambiance too. I definitely recommend getting a bunch of ""tapas "" rather than main entrees they are far superior. The Hummus and the Risotto are amazing especially the hummus!",2
"I don't think my experience was typical, and they were having an off night at Sierra Bonita Grill. Normally cuisine is very well prepared, but when I got my enchiladas they were cold and watery. The guac was already kinda browning after a minute or two at the table, which made it unpaletable. For the price, I would expect better. I will still give them another shot, their service is always great.",1
"Get the 7.77 deal, you won't regret it. That is, if they haven't stopped serving it. I first saw it on Rachael Ray's 40 Dollars A Day and had to try it. Steak, shrimp, baked potato and salad? And it was all pretty good, and just the right amount of food. And I think you even get a vegetable with that.",2
"I had miso ramen, my cohort had shio ramen. I also ordered karrage chicken and gyoza. nI was in my ramen happy place. My partner not so much. Shio tasted off to her and she felt it had too much oil floating on top. I gave her the rest of my broth for her noodles she liked that much better. Service was great. Need more non caffine drink offerings as a suggestion. Coconut water ect.",2
"Yummy decadent burgers.this was the place for it. I was only here once but it was a memorable visit. We had lunch, sat in a comfy booth with our own personal tv and had the Kobe burger. Delicious! I also had the shrimp salad which was very good too. Feeling like a burger, head over to Mandalay Bay and enjoy.",2
"This place is so much fun,. They always have several flavors of yogurt and tons of topping to choose from. Word to the wise think about how much you'll really eat when you will your cup you get charged by the weight. Once I got an 8 dollar cup and couldn't eat like 1 3 of it. About 2 dollars worth will fill me up!",2
"I've always enjoyed the food, been there numerous times. On the weekends sat. Sun. I expect a wait no matter what time, especially during the school year. But a 15 minute wait at 2PM on a Friday during the end of the semester, for one person? When there was no one at the hostess station in front of me? Forget that walked out and not heading back any time soon unless other people insist.",1
"I try very hard to avoid McDonald's, but today I just wanted a quick coffee and I did not want to get out of my car. So I pulled through this drive through, placed my order, and waited. And waited. And waited. When I had pulled up at the window, there was no one behind me. When my coffee was finally delivered, there were three cars already behind me. WTH, McD's?",1
"I have one word outstanding! I would highly recommend Shaun and his company to anyone ieed of a fast, efficient, professional and job well done. Flat rate, no hidden charges! Very personable! Rescued my ""black pearl "" after being broken into. he drove it straight to the mechanics and it arrived Undamaged and prompt. Again fantastic!",2
"Two stars 9 10 months out of the year. Really just a place with overpriced chocolate you can get anywhere else, a two minute tour, and plants you can see there OR 1000 feet away on the Mesa preserve. During the holiday season, the place looks really cool and is worth seeing at least once. But other than those lights, this place is nothing super special.",1
"We love coming here! Good solid food and great service. Lorenzo the manager is friendly, kind and very accommodating. He regularly checks on his staff and guests and makes sure everyone leaves happy. He even gave both our daughter and Ginny her doll ice cream! A great place to stop for lunch, especially if you have young children.",2
"Don't ever go here. The oysters were slimy didn't taste fresh, the mixed drinks were basically non alcoholic which I expect in the store front places but this is not a cheap restaurant. To top it all off the waiter was a snob not friendly at all, in Harrahs I wouldn't expect snobby waiters. Save your money go anywhere else.",1
Went to 3D Baby Kisses and we had such an amazing experience! The staff is amazing and the facility is so nice. My Photos and video is really nice and they walked us through all our baby's movements. Thanks for the unforgetable experience. Will deffinately will be back for baby 2! By the way It's a GIRL!,2
"So delicious! nI want it everytime I come down to AJ for the weekend. Their food is better than Erikberto's and Filiberto's and at a lower price. It doesn't look like a lot when you drive by it, but believe me you have got to stop into this little hole in the wall. Truly the gem in the Apache Junction mexican food scene.",2
"I haven't stopped talking about their chocolate chip pancakes since I ate them yesterday morning! I don't know that I've ever had pancakes better than this. The 3, 8 "" diameter cakes are enough for 2 I was only able to take a small bite of the included biscuit. We arrived at 8 45am on Saturday, and there wasn't a wait. When we left, seats were still available.",2
"As a previous poster mentioned date 7 26 2013 this place would have been better, if it weren't for the service. Basically, if you're not a Hipster here you might as well forget it. The food was good, but not extraordinary, I've had much better Thai food. I did like the tofu options for all the meals, however! Yes, I am NOT a hipster and I DO eat tofu. ",1
"They always mess up on your order. The white rice is sometimes hard and undercooked. Their meat has a lot of fat and is never cooked properly. The bobas are nasty. They have no flavor and a ton of sugar. When they first opened, their food was ok. Now it's horrible, it just seems as if they no longer care what they are serving.",1
"This is the worst company ever! My next door neighbor built a pergola right on top of our wall, didn't finish the side that faces my yard and has a tarp for the roof. I contacted the HOA a year and a half ago and they have done nothing even though this neighbor violated multiple guidelines for permanent structures. This company brings property values down.DO NOT USE THEM!",1
"After a long trip from Toronto to Vegas we've lost our excitement after finding that there staffs don't have customer service ethics, they seem to be avoiding customers, no smile, no eye contact, the waiter didn't even look at us when he handed out the bill, and the worst thing was.we found the dinuguan meat with lots of ""balahibo "" and the chicken Inasal was still raw, not a good food trip!",1
"I come here for lunch whenever I visit the strip. The food is average but the Mongolian grill is awesome. They also have a really big variety of sushi rolls. Most importantly, the service is excellent and everyone is friendly. They are always busy and crowded so I would come either early around 11 or late around 1.",2
"This is a solid place. The music was a little too loud when I was there last, but this is a good place to meet with friends and have a nice drink. Low key, especially for Scottsdale, down to earth place. nI didn't partake of the food, but the cider I had was exactly what I needed. nThe place is located right near Ray's Pizza too, so that's never a bad thing.",2
"Walked in calling 15 minutes before and got seated right away. They went out of their way to try and move us to a booth, but could not manage. Great effort though. Great selection on wine and accommodated us splitting two meals. Sat for a while after finishing drinks and no rush to leave. Met the owner, very friendly and stopped by table several times throughout night.",2
"GOLDEN WINGS! That's all I have to say about that. ZIPPARITAS! That's all I have to say about that too. nMy only gripe is that from time to time you get an unattentive waitress who you will end up having to call back over. I mean, come on! Who's tippin' who here? Besides THAT, I loves ya Zipp's. The end.",2
"I ordered a pesto chicken pizza to go and ate a red velvet cake there. It was moist and soft but the frosting was a little bit too sweet for me. While waiting at the bar for our pizza the waiter got confused and gave our pizza to the customers dining in. So we have to waited another ten to fifteen extra minutes for our pizza, but it was worth the wait.",2
"Had a meeting at ASU after lunch and picked this place to eat and prepare. No wi fi was a HUGE downer. I suppose I understand the management not wanting people to stay all day, but next time I'm looking for a place to do a working lunch, I'll look elsewhere. Food was okay, too. And canned sodas meant I couldn't take a refill with me. I had the plain chicken sandwich and it was plain.",1
Yeah I hated this place. Better off eating Chef Boy R D out of the can cold. Horrible staff who didn't care one way or the other if you were enjoying your experience. Probably the WORST decor on the vegas strip. nProbably the best thing about the place.the view of the lamborghini off in the distance. Trust me.DONT COME HERE!,1
"Tech support in the store is nonexistent. If you have any issues with a phone, don't waste you time going in, just call tech support. The store locations are only good for checking out the phones and buying. Let me find something positive.it's nice how they open the door for you, but that's where it ends.",1
"Why didn't I check yelp? Terrible service. Poor security. Vehicle got broken into during my last day at their lot and manager on duty couldn't be bothered. She kept asking if we were still leaving that day. I'm giving 2 stars since the rooms themselves are decent and clean. If you want a cheap place to stay and not concerned about security, this is a good place to go.",1
"This place really needs to reconsider what kind of employees they have working late night. I pulled up to the drive thru 12 5 around 130a and the supposed ""supervisor "" denied me service. He just kept telling me ""No you gotta go "" I was really confused but I guess they just didn't feel like working. Management, if this is the case with your employees don't bother being open 24h then!",1
"Bring your own wine here. Call ahead for larger groups . nDelicious meatballs and pasta. This is a tiny place that has a few tables and is cozy inside. If we had known be could bring our own wine we would have, apparently almost everybody else knew to BYOB. I had a chicken garlic bruschetta that was tasty but had too much bread. Fresh and delicious. We will visit again!",2
"Although I have read so many good reviews on this place, but I must say I was very disappointed. The main reason is because it takes almost 40 minutes for our food to arrive. And for some unknown reason, the table next to us who ordered 10 minutes after us got their food faster than us. We went there on Sat. noon, and it wasn't terribly busy. Sad face.",1
"A must know EXPENSIVE I went here for a work dinner. The steak is absolutely amazing, and so are the sides, not a single bad thing I can say about the place. A nice place for a celebration. Very dim dark waitress hands out a small flashlight if required to read the menu Very noisy as its connected to a bar with live music",2
"Montreal has a lot of good pastry shops, and to me, this one is the best. Their desserts are excellent, and they also do a killer brunch on weekends only. I think maybe only Sundays? Can't remember. At any rate, if you are in the area, you should try it. They take reservations for their first seating around 10 AM? , so if you don't want to wait, call ahead, because they are pretty small.",2
"My wife just returned from here. First, they didn't want to do her nails because she didn't have an appointment even though the place was more than half empty and 3 or 4 employees were surfing the web or texting on their cell phones . Ridiculous! They finally agreed and then did a CRAP job! Cut her cuticles until they bled. NEVER AGAIN! BEWARE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!",1
"Love this place! My husband and I eat here somewhat regularly and it is always consistent. They prepare some of the best steaks I've eaten thick, juicy, and tender. Prices are reasonable, plates include salad and potato option. Vegetables are a la carte. Good ambience, friendly and prompt service, and happy hour available.",2
"Well, the staff are hot. And it's awesome that they were offering free mouth shots of whatever berry liquor that was. nBut the atmosphere was really lame. I can't really describe it any better or in any further detail. It just blew. nBut like someone else said, maybe I'm just used to the classier spots in Vegas night life. But most bars everywhere don't treat themselves like clubs.",1
"Best sushi buffet! So good! We definitely ate our money's worth of food! The service was super slow, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. They have a huge parking lot right outside. there was no wait when we went in for dinner on Thursday night. Too bad this place isn't on the strip, or it'll be packed! Should definitely drive out from the strip to try this place!",2
"Wife and I went here one night to try it out. It is down the road from our house. We went in and we were the youngest people in there by about 30 years. This place caters to an older crowd. We sat at the bar and the service was good. The bartenders were very attentive and helpful. The food was meh. I probably will not go back, just not my thing.",1
"This is sub par Hawaiian. The meat was tough and stringy and there is only plastic silverware. The Macaroni salad has twice the amount of mayonnaise needed, the vegetables were cold. My stomach has been flipping all night after eating here. I have had better Hawaiian in the valley for much less. If you are ever in the neighborhood for Leo's, give that a try.",1
"Set Jet is undeniably an amazing experience all around, including the professional staff and the personalized service feel from the moment you arrive at their terminal. It's an amazing private travel experience and you certainly can't beat the cost! I would highly recommend Set Jet to anyone looking for an exceptional flying experience.",2
"Love this breakfast spot! Super funky interior decor with real fruit smoothies no blends of yogurt, milk, ice.or any other thing that has no rightful place in a FRUIT smoothie I bought baked goods last time I was in Montreal from Chez Jos u00e9 and brought them back to Halifax. That's how good the baking is!",2
"great food at their food bar, ready to serve to eat there or to go. Prices are decent and its on a great SW Vegas location. I've had the Carnitas torta pulled pork sandwich and the pork chunks with nopales cactus ears sliced julienne style in green salsa with your standard beans and red rice. The food is great! Then the store itself is well stocked with the basic kitchen must have.",2
"I have been going here for about a year and I absolutely love everyone there! Everyone is always friendly and attentive to your needs. My gel manicures always last a good 5 weeks! I usually have Tony do my nails, but Aiden does a great job as well! I highly recommend this place. I wouldn't go anywhere else.",2
"This gigantic club has 8 separate areas including VIP upstairs lounge. Hot half naked girls dancing to club music. This may sound like a great time, but don't be fooled it's going to be really lame. My only excuse for going is a friend would get me in for free. I would actually recommend it, if you are from out of town and have never been to a high end large dance club.",1
Not bad for the money! The pool was way too crowded. Would go here again if i came back to vegas. We wanted to stay at the paris hotel and we are glad we didnt because it was right in the middle of all of the crazy people bugging you to buys show tickets every 2 feet. That would get really annoying!,2
Prices are good and came for a band which was great. The service however is inconsistent and who and how many drinks they will serve varies based on the bartender. If you have policies no problem but they need to be enforced consistently or not be in place. I will continue to come for shows but would recommend only coming if you understand the poor service you will receive.,1
Second time going to moon valley cafe. Food and service was wonderful. n the only reason I'm giving it such a low rating is because they allowed a couple to eat inside the restaurant with their DOG sitting on the bench of the booth with them. That's unsanitary and they should have been told to eat on the patio with the dog. And this wasn't a service dog. Very disappointed,1
"Love this place! High quality food.fresh, free range, local, organic. We were in Edinburgh for three breakfasts and ate here for every one. I really loved the Raw Cacoa smoothie, poached eggs with salmon, and raw salad. Amazing place! Full of light, yes cozy.made me feel warm and fuzzy and kept my stomach purring all day long ",2
"I have only ever gotten gel manicures here but I love this place. They do the best gel manicures, hands down, of any nail salon I have visited in Pittsburgh. The one I have now has lasted 3 weeks! Every single time, my gel manis as promised last the full 2 weeks or more. They remember me whenever I come in, are warm and friendly, and always fit me in even if they're busy. Great place!",2
"This is a great mountain golf course. I played this golf course when it first opened and there wasn't a home on the course I know it's unbelievable . Now, the course is littered with homes but it still is a great test of desert golf. 18 is classic and Sam and I saw first hand a coyote take a golf ball right off the fairway. Desert Rules!",2
"So excited that an NYPD Pizza opened in my neighborhood! We stopped in with a friend last week and had a great experience friendly server, nice atmosphere and delicious pizza! I tried the Big Kahuna and loved it! The personal pizza was the perfect size for me, but the guys in the group ordered the small since they were hungrier than I was. Love that they have cider on tap too bonus!",2
"Cheap food, but most of the dishes I've tried are way too greasy and that ruins it for me. I would go there all the time if every dish I ordered wasn't swimming in oil. Even at that price there is better in Chinatown. It doesn't matter if the noodles are homemade if you're mostly just slurping oily sauce while eating them. The peanut dumplings are pretty good!",1
"A place to visit for fiber lovers! I have been to shops all over the U.S. And this shop is one of the best! The shop is filled with quality yarns from around the world along with unique Las Vegas knitting accessories, yarns and roving. Classes are offered at reasonable prices for every skillset and groups meet weekly to have some laughs and share their love of needlework.",2
We love it and the veal sage ravioli is amazing. The Osso Buco to die for. This is not a place you go everyday but they own a lot of other places here in Charlotte. So you can get the same qaulity and a little less pricey. Osteria Coco in front is the and I believe meaa luna too.Really good Northern Italian Food,2
"I remember coming here like 8 9 years ago when I first came here to eat. I was so surprised with all the different sushi and deserts you can get to eat. I was so happy and excited that it was so cheap and fresh the food. Ate 6 plates full of sushi with no space left hehee. I'm a fattie. Ate so much, had to unzip my shorts LoLz . Went back to NY and told everyone lolz.",2
"At the top of Palms Fantasy Tower, it's awesome. If your group is hot enough you'll get walked up to Playboy Moon. Soft shell crab is my fave thing on the menu, sorry to say. Their entr u00e9es were kinda mediocre. For presentation of restaurant they get 4 stars, food is 3 at best. Sorry Mr. Malouf.",1
I stopped in here for work purposed and went ahead and tried and Boba Tea. I had never had one before but I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know what flavor I had because I asked for whatever was good. This is a cool little spot with bright colors and friendly staff. I would defiantly stop by here again if I am in the area ,2
"This place is exactly what the name suggests. Tiny menu fish tacos only but they're yummy! Pros Nice salsa and topping selection, the staff were upbeat and helpful, the restaurant was clean and well maintained it's brand new . Cons I would have liked more fresh salsa options, but they do what they do well. Would definitely go back next time I'm over there at Costco or shopping for furniture!",2
This parking lot sucks. Whoever thought of having the drive thru come through the actual parking spaces needs to go back to architecture school. My chicken sandwhich was extremely over cooked and wht can I never get something that looks like the advertised photo? My order always looks thrown together.,1
"Spending a long weekend in Phoenix and out adventuring around, I dropped into Snooze for brunch. From the moment I walked in and heard Erasure playing, I was hooked. I sat at the bar and had the gazpacho bloody mary done spicy and the breakfast pot pie. The food was perfect an absolutely perfectly done sunny side up egg! and the young and friendly staff was terrific. Love the vibe!",2
"I stopped by Molly's stand in Mund's Park with my family and I could not have been more impressed with the tamales. The gentleman working that rainy morning was one of the friendliest people I came across in Arizona. While he tamales were being steamed he asked questions about my vacation a seemed genuinely interested. To top it off, the tamales were outstanding.",2
You do receive a lot of food and this place is a great value. My wife loved the curry chicken and my son liked the orange chicken. My chicken lo mein was bland. No real taste to it. The egg fried rice was bland as well. The 4 stars is because everyone really liked their food and I thought mine was so so. We will order from here again and I think I'll try something different.,2
"First time here, why didn't I come sooner?! Both my malteses look great. They are extra soft now! I really like how open the grooming room is very clean! I was shocked to see no clutter or ounce of dirt! Both dogs were done on time which I am not not use to. nFirst time visit 10 off on yelp check in! nConvenient, easy and friendly service!",2
"I highly recommend RR Limousines Car Service! They are extremely prompt, proactive, courteous and professional drivers. They're excellence in what they do make all the difference in world especially when utilizing their services for airport transportation they absolutely take care of you curb side to curb side, and get the job done!",2
Extremely poor service and attitude! I had a reservation for a Saturday night using the Groupon offer that expires in a few days and is only good for Saturdays. nThey refused to accept it even though they accepted the reservation knowing I had a Groupon. Their attitude was terrible! I would never attempt to go there again.,1
"Horrible, horrible place. Wannabe Paris Hiltons abound as do the greasy Rico Suave guys with their striped, button down shirts top buttons undone to expose their drain clogging chest mat. Semi famous hockey players, people palming Benjamins, washed up celebrities Britney for New Years?! C'mON! and the Pussycat Dolls get to cut in line. Once you're in, you have no idea what all the fuss was about.",1
This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas. The selection here isn't as big as other Vietnamese restaurants but I always find something regardless. Good quality food and the cool thing about this place is that I don't have to worry about leaving the restaurant smelling like pho like other Vietnamese restaurants.,2
"I've ordered for delivery a few times. Although you get small portions for the price.the food is pretty good. This time I and a coworker ordered 2 seperate dishes that came with rice. They combined the rice in one container. Why? My coworker leaves in 10 mins with my rice.ugh! Called the restaurant and all I get is a . ""wellll.I don't know what I can do? "" Are you serious?",1
Well let me say that first off I place a lot of value in great food and ambiance. This restaurant made it for me. In a world of chain restaurants I treasure unique high quality places to dine. One thing that bores me to tears is menus that all look a like. I thrive on trying different places. I savor eating different cuisines. I would go to this restaurant again. Kudos to you Chef Lionel!,2
"Was in Pittsburgh for 2 nights and came here both nights for giant, cheap ice cream loaded with sprinkles for the kids. Didn't like the chocolate ice cream, but the vanilla and confetti cake were great. If I had been there another night, would have gone for the handrolled cones, which smelled great. We were here in summer, so the lines were short and students scarce.",2
"Update to my last review http www.kpho.com story 22420825 customers say ibeach tan closed without notice not providing refunds. Hopefully you others paid with a credit card. I have successfully had all charges reversed through my CC company. Nice little ""fuck you "" to the ibeach owners who will not issue the refunds themselves. I encourage all others to do the same.",1
"I've never been a big dessert guy, but it's hard to say no to some custom made delicious cupcakes. Red velvet is oh so sweet. nNot so thin mint is super minty. nPumpkin spice is such a treat. nThe Carter is so peanut buttery. I would definitely check this place out. Just don't let your dentist find out.",2
"This is so good very pricey though they have a lot good bone marrow, shrimp ceviche, mashed potatoes creamy, good quality cakes, if your a adventurous eater I'd recommend this. Risotto done right, lamb, prime rib, Along with very good desserts except the macaroons This one review is a little late but here it is getting a new review next time ago",2
Granted it is a Sunday evening and it can be a bit busy but the food was bland and scarce for a CiCi's.the women's restroom was DISGUSTING but when I told the manager she seemed caring apologized and sent someone right then to go clean it. we didnt stick around to find out how that turned out but in the future I would rather drive across town to a different CiCis than return here!,1
Got the Fish and chips. Tasted like it had been siting under the heat lamp for a wile. Greasy and old. All for 12.99. Wife got a burger. looked like something off of the value menu at Burger King. nCalled the manager the next day and he is going to send a gift card. That was nice but I don't really want to go back. nNo attention to detail a this place.,1
"Do yourself a favor and do not eat here. I would never eat there again, even if it was free. Everything was tasteless. Who are they trying to fool? The buffet attendants are in chef coats and tall white hats! Lol! The only edible thing there were slices of cantaloupe and watetmelon. You're better off eating anywhere else that's nearby.",1
" 4.99 rib eye and eggs special. it's only available between midnight 8 am. It's well worth it for the price alone, especially for a place that's on the strip. The place may look like a dive compared to the rest of Vegas, but after a night of heavy drinking, this place will look colorful and the steak and eggs will taste even better! Definitely a must after the club and before bedtime.",2
"Great Hotel, Nice simple place with ease of access to highway, restaurants and clean. Friendly staff. Even though there were many choices at this price point and location I feel that my choice of Econo Lodge was a good one here in Charlotte. Look forward to my next stay in early 2013. Keep up the good work.",2
"This is a hard review . On the one hand the zipperitas are great . And some of the happy hour prices are good However I have yet to have good service at this location, every time you order the servers make it seem like you are putting them out and are never very willing to be helpful nI also do not think they have never changed the fry oil since they opened",1
"I currently have three properties covered with them. None will be renewed. They sent out a ""plumber "" to check on a burned out disposal motor. The ""plumber "" stuck his hand down the drain, called the office, and came back with, ""they don't want to cover this. "" And Jessica at the office? Yikes! Develop some customer services skills. They're only in business to collect your 55 service call fees.",1
"I placed an order and was told to expect delivery within 10 14 days. It has now been 7 weeks and still not a peep from this company even though I've called multiple times about the order that I had already paid for in advance. I am considering my options at this point, but please save yourself a lot of buyer's remorse and stay away from this ""business "".",1
"Arrived at 11 30 on a Wednesday and ordered promptly. It took 30 minutes for a salad and a french dip and they weren't very busy . The fries were cold. The sandwich was cool. The au jus was hot enough to burn my lip, thereby rendering the whole thing inedible until it cooled. The ranch was so runny it was like water. And, to top it off, got a touch of food poisoning. Won't ever go back!",1
"Reviewing the Made To Order Drink and Food Bars Unacceptable. At 8 am on a Monday, a client and I waited an hour for n1 egg white omelette n1 cold sandwich n1 iced coffee n1 fresh juice n Total bill about 45. I was mortified and frustrated will never go back again. Staff did not seem to care, nor did they give us an approximate wait time the juice alone took 20 minutes .",1
Quality offering at a reasonable price? Check. nBurgers fresh and cooked the way they were meant be cooked? Check. nGreat fries 2 kinds no less? Check. This is a tweener restaurant perfect for a great casual dinner. Not too expensive. Not cheap and greasy. Just right for that one day of the week when you want something in between. Enjoy.,2
"Great steak with very reasonable prices. I had the filet with prawns and 2 sides for 26 what a great value. Comes with homemade breads and pesto garlic dip, and bacon corn bread. The only downside is very small restaurant and you can hear the casino slots ringing during your whole meal. Will be back soon.",2
"This place was a great surprise. I thought it would be intimidating based on their website, but I felt immediately at home, they were even welcoming to our sleeping baby. The server was extremely friendly, and altered everything to be completely veg friendly for us. The food was great, and the desserts blew us away. We were very, very happy with our visit.",2
"No ""to go menu "", had to stand around or sit at a dining table while I waited for my take out order. 30 for 2 rolls and 2 pieces of salmon sushi, which is bad enough but every bite tasted like warm glue. Never in my life have I thrown out sushi before. This place and its food is the WORST sushi experience in my 20 years here!",1
Service HORRIBLE. nWe had a reservation and they made us wait for 25 min. They did not have the courtesy of apologizing for making us wait. Trust me it was not a pleasure waiting with two kids. The owner was not at all friendly. nFood Good. nBut you will have to pay me to go back there. Never stepping in there again.,1
"The customer service at this discount tire is the gold standard. They don't try to over sell you, aren't pushy, are extremely knowledgeable. I just can't say enough about their service. I bought new tires for my fiances car and after talking to them on our needs, they ended up selling me the least expensive tire. That's rare but they definitely look out for the customers best interest.",2
"We love buffets, Vegas had bomb ones. This one wasn't as good as others we've had. It was great, don't get me wrong but not incredible. However The eggs Benedict, the French toast the wicked passion fruit juice were 5 stars the rest was meh. A lot of the other items were dry from the heat lamps I though. Service was great too, very friendly and helpful",2
"If you love butter, then this place is definitely for you! I went on a mission to find the best prime rib steak place, and Ruth's Chris has failed in my eyes. The place is way to buttery and takes away from the natural flavors of the beef. Your money is better spent at Houston's, Morton's or Lawry's. Take it from me. someone who has gout because of the steak quest!",1
"James and his staff are amazing. They are extremely knowledgable, and go well out of their way to help their customers. I've had them do driveshafts, ball joints, and gears on my JK and they have bent over backwards to work around my schedule and budget. nI can't recommend these people highly enough!",2
"I went to Starbucks in target this evening, I ordered a cheese danish and tall coffee, I asked the gurl to warm up the cheese danish and she told me that they don't have a microwave! nThe coffee was even cold and I asked her to make a new one and I stayed waiting for another 10 minutes cause me to arrive late to work!",1
"I got the Breastfast Burrito sans eggs and tofu because of allergies. It was amazing! Their fruit bowl is versatile and fun. Noisy ish if you're dining in, mostly because of the juicer yes they juice your drinks right there. but think of it like a cafe. nFun and original! Great varieties and options for vegans and people with allergies!",2
This chippy has been run by the same family since 1967. It's fish and chips are excellent and it also sells kebabs and pizza. There's always a queue but don't let that put you off. There's usually a staff of about 10 people behind the counter so queues don't last long. Their prices are the same as anywhere else and they deliver.,2
"I was exceedingly ieed of nourishment so I willingly shelled out 10 for a mediocre gyro salad. The gyro meat was of a sizeable serving, but much too salty, and placed atop a pathetic pile of iceberg. The pita bread was over charred and crunchy. My Mediterranean ancestors would not have been pleased.",1
"This is my favorite macayo's. I really like this place been coming here for many years. I always have the baja chimi and a margarita. I know its run of the mill, but they have this dish nailed down. I worked at the one on central when I was a young muchacha and their chimi is good too. But Im always disappointed with the one on warner bummer cause its closer to me",2
DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. They messed up our order. Then tried to charge us for their mistake. They said 30 minutes. 1hour later food came. It was missing a whole meal. When we called they said they would send one out. Then called back and tried to charge for their mess up. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!,1
WHAT A BUNCH OF IDIOTS! My parents moved from Az to Ca. Requested a forwarding from the old phone number and four phone calls later the mental giants nstill can't figure out their job! I guess even though the pool of people to hire from is probably better than ever they still manage to scrape the bottom of the barrel.,1
"I have no problem with the product of the actual store but the delivery service they use is delivering the piece of furniture I got 1 week and a half after I bought even though it was in stock at the store on a weekday with a 4 hour time frame. I paid 125 for shipping. What a rip off, I will never buy anything from restoration hardware again.",1
"I have celiac disease and usually don't have an issue with Chipotle. However, today at this location the girl was a complete mess. She didn't understand what celiac disease was, my specific instructions or the need to change her gloves. It wasn't even busy, I won't ever be back. I'm extremely annoyed that I can't eat a simple corn taco without getting sick. Step up your game, Chipotle.",1
Where else can you rent dvds or cds for free! Wi fi is free and as long as you want. There's even a cafe downstairs if you really need a pick me up. The second level has a good selection of magazines and newspapers if you need to look at a past issue for school or work. Get inspired by all the books or just by the views of the city on the top floor!,2
"We arrived for Saturday brunch and we didn't see foie gras on the menu, but we were able to order it anyway. It was amazing. It was seared perfectly and the proportion was pretty generous. The texture was silky and buttery. Mmmm, that was the best I've had in years! The only drawback was the food took forever to come out.",2
"My waitress was fine but pizza seemed like something out of the frozen food section at Walmart. I ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza, which i've had before at a regular non airport CPK and the toppings looked a bit wilty and it just didn't taste like much. Not a bad experience overall but not near as good as a regular CPK.",1
"Do I have to give it a star? nVery disappointed in this place! I can't believe all the hipe! We just got the basic chicken. nI will never, ever go back to this place! Why pass by Popeyes and Churches chicken to go to this place! Kudos for opening a business, and creating jobs. This just doesn't float my boat!",1
"This crappy hotel refused to refund tickets to a show they sponsored, the Rockin Poppin New Year's Eve show of Phixation. This ""band "" lip synced all their music and didn't even fake play their own instruments. The VP of Even Managment said, ""tough luck "" when we left the show and requested refunds. Don't stay here.",1
"I can't speak much about the line a party of 16 bachelorettes has no problems with lines or cover charges at Vegas clubs but the decor was okay, though it is an obvious ripoff of the now outdated and tourist overrun Buddha Bar in Paris. However, the stairwell leading to the Tao Beach dance floor was hot, stuffy and emanated a definite miasma of vomit. Lovely.",1
"I was never a fan of Chicago style dogs and never thought of patronizing this place. But I happened to stop by after Legend's and had a Polish sausage there. It was just okay but it was a little burnt. Their fries is also a little too greasy for me. Seriously, don't expect great food at this place. But it's okay if you're looking for some grub after a few drinks at the bars.",1
"Places like this are why I love yelp. With less than an hour for lunch while visiting from out of town, my wife and I were delighted to find this place. We shared a delicious lamb kabob perfectly marinated and tender, with a simple rice pilaf and pita on the side. Super friendly owners, who answered all of our questions with grace and humor. Nice to know the lamb is halal.",2
"My bf and I love going here when I visit him from out of town. his favorite is the pulled pork and I love their ice cream sandwiches. The ice cream sandwiches are literally to die for. Last time we went we were too full, so we ordered one to go! The Hoochie Mama is my fav drink, so yummy. The inside of the restaurant is great, lots of tvs and great service!",2
Don't putt putt here! The greens are ripped up and the holes in disrepair. We made it to hole 10 when their bulls eye attraction are our balls. Someone had kicked it in. How do you not inspect your greens? What's more. They refused to give a refund and tried to give us another round. I will not go back and explained this to the manager who finally gave me my money back.,1
"Back in 2011 I was working for the US Forest Service at the Tanker Base out at Phoenix Mesa Gateway Airport and had to find a place to stay. A few of my fellow aerial firefighters suggested this hotel. I was glad I did. The rooms were great, everything that I needed to shop was nearby, and the staff was great. I stayed there for three months.",2
"Do not go to this venue at night unless you have a reservation, otherwise you will be wasting an expensive cab fare. They are very inflexible about adding late comers and can only accommodate 20 max per tour. Even though the website says they recommend reservations, they should probably just require them in advance to save everyone the headache.",1
"I honestly do love Trader Joes because of the variety of people that patronize and work there. I think the prices are decent, and since I am a vegetarian and try to live a healthy lifestyle, I generally am happy with Trader Joe's. I wish it actually provided most of the things you need for everyday life because we all know chocolate covered toffee isn't a necessity . Other than that I am happy.",2
"Let me start by saying that I am Argentine. I recently moved to Pittsburgh and I was VERY hesitant to eat here. I was pleasantly surprised. The Chorizo is not authentic Argentine Chorizo, but the Chimichuri, and the steak sandwich was phenomenal. The service was great and the menu was quite impressive considering the size of the restaurant. I will be back for sure.",2
"Beware of this location. I accidentally left my jacket in my rental car and 10 minutes later it was no where to be found. I was originally told they found it but that was a lie. ""Take your belongings "" doesn't mean steal your customers belongings. I will never use this company again. What a shame, I travel a TON for work.",1
"It is what it is with this place. Its not Mastros but its priced were it needs to be for what it is. Burgers are good, steaks are decent and staff is friendly. Been here alot. Its always the same. Big problem is the low quality margarine with the rolls. Disgusting. They would get 5 stars if it wasn't for that.",2
"We were thinking this would be an awesome place because we could bring the dog but from the second we got here I was ready to go. First off, you can smoke on the patio? I don't enjoy eating my food with other people's second hand smoke. Secondly, the food was less than mediocre. Needless to say, we won't be eating here again. There are tons of other real cool places to take the pups!",1
"Most of the food here is adequate, but that's about all I can say. The service is okay, but not great. The wait staff is generally nice, but not friendly, and not very quick. I can say that I was VERY dissapointed by their idea of ""bruschetta "". I refused to eat it. It was pita bread, cold tomatoes, slabs of mozzerella cheese, and avocado. Awful.",1
"Everytime and friend of mines comes to town we always come to eat here because the staff is amazing especially the manager and the rolls are awesome! Last time we were here the manager allowed us to be seated, even though it was close to closing, and gave us free desert. She is an amazing person.MmmmMMmmm, it's pricey but worth it.",2
"As a piano guitar teacher, I frequent music stores alot. Had mixed experiences here over the years. A few days ago, the Guitar dept guy was very helpful and nice. Just now, I went to purchase a strap and was totally ignored which has happened before. Sam Ash has always noticed me I'm actually hard to miss so this is where I send my students.",1
"This place sucks, they milked a extended warranty we had purchased with a used car years ago. Every week like clockwork some other expensive component was broke, but it was usually covered. They also almost blew up my car and me in it when they did not install a hose going to my gastank after fixing it. It came off while driving and I dumped a full tank of gas in 30 seconds .",1
"The Crepes are delicious. But the wait is horrible. On a Saturday or Sunday expect to wait an hour to get a table, even if you are told it's ""about a 15 minute wait "". After you get seated expect to wait another 30 45 minutes for your food to arrive. The crepes are great, but waiting for an hour and half for your food to arrive from start to finish is incomparable.",1
"This place is great! I've been though a few groomers with my Standard Poodle,non of which groomed him they way I wanted. The gentleman at Lazy Dog took the time to get to know my scared little guy. He asked specific questions pertaining to my dogs needs and personality. When he was finished I came back to a happy and perfectly groomed poodle. Not an easy task!",2
"The entire office was very professional and friendly. I was promptly seated and introduced to all the staff members. With a history of traumatic experiences with other dental offices, Dr. Kang made me very comfortable and at ease. Overall, I was very pleased with my first visit at Pure Dental and I would highly recommend them to all my friends family.",2
"This place is ridiculously expensive for meh food. I tried some lasagna, also had the quesadilla and some chicken strips. The food was fine, nothing special, but it cost a ton of money! I have no idea why they charge so much, this is the simple casual place. There are many other restaurants in Vegas with similar price points with much better ambiance and food. Go to one of those.",1
"I am so done with this place! This is the third time I've shown up to a closed Haven Burgers during their ""business "" hours. Burgers are good but not worth the annoyance, waste of time and gas. Seems like the owner changes hours of operation like he changes his underwear. Note to all they now close at 5pm on Mondays.",1
"Fantastic property. Very luxurious, excellent service from everyone. Beautiful views of Vegas from the rooms. Close to the action. One of the better casinos on premises. A couple of cautions. On property restaurants are VERY expensive and not always great. And there was no coffee maker in the room, so it meant a 1 4 mile walk to Starbucks every morning. But all in all two thumbs up.",2
"I was so excited to have a cupcake from Carlos bakery because on t.v they make it seem like they are the best in the whole world so I figured I would try them. I had a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate cupcake.I was quite disappointed actually. It wasn't by far any better than cupcakes at my local bakery "" Sift "".",1
"pickpocketed do not come here unless you want to get pick pocketed. i was pick pocketed 700, mine and my best friend who had just turned 21 an hour before ids, a 800 iphone, and 4 credit cards! nall mandalay bat had to say was ""sorry "" and hang up the phone. they let the sketchiest people in. there's a ton of creepy old men trying to hit on young girls. totally disgusting. dont waist your time.",1
Great new place. I believe they've been open for six months. I went here for a business dinner. The staff were very friendly and attractive as you'd expect from Montreal. nWe opt'd to let the Chef decide on the tapas for the table and we finished with fish to share. Every plate was well presented and we enjoyed every one. nI would go back in heartbeat.,2
Every time we tried to put in gas it kept saying please visit another pump or pump in use wheo one was there or using the pump. Multiple cars have come and gone without filling gas or using the store inside. Horrendous. Skip this if you have the chance. No public restroom unless you are an employee. Fail.,1
"The food here is ok. Service is decent. Realistically, there are several options in this area ie. Pei Wei or Rumbi where you can get similar style food that tastes better and wont cost as much. 3 for an iced tea. 9.99 for a basic, regular sized bowl. I figured it was worth a try.but likely won't be back.",1
"This spot is great, great location, great service, not the best for glass tho. A lot of smoke shops in the area, this is in my top two for price and service. This spot is great, great location, great service, not the best for glass tho. A lot of smoke shops in the area, this is in my top two for price and service.",2
"When you're on a trip and forget toiletries.toothpaste, etc.there's nothing like a 99 Cent Store to bail you out. That was the case on a recent trip to Vegas. We stopped by this store and was able to get what we needed for under 3. I love it. The store was clean and the lines moved quickly. The employees here are efficient, which is not always the case in these stores. Return Factor 80 ",2
"4am in the morning? only place open at the MGM grand, ordered the french dip sandwich and it was pretty good but expensive.i guess its expected when your in vegas. Ok place to head to if your staying at the MGM and too lazy to drive out for something better They have a small selection of food and nothing really worth talking about.",1
"Disappointed. Again, another Summerlin McD's just doesn't cut it. The burgers were tasty and at least not dry but not hot. They were just a bit over room temperature. Granted, business was slow when we arrived, with only two other guests. Not sure if we will come back here again. If we do, maybe we should take our food home and microwave it just a bit. Ugh.",1
"Easily my favorite coffeehouse in SqHill. Their coffees are reasonably priced and high quality. I used to be a big fan of another SqHill coffee institution that shall remaiameless . One morning I had to go to said place in stead of Commonplace, and, no lie, I almost spit out my coffee it tasted so bad in comparison.",2
"Very good bar food and inexpensive prices. But even the ""smoke free "" dining is a little smokey. But NOT as bad as the bar side for sure. Their fried zucchini is a favorite of my wife and I and even with a few beers added to the burger and fries our bill has always been under 40. We moved out of the general area but we still make it back every now and again for the food.",2
"What brought us here tonight was a one time collaboration with chef Nick Hodge from Icehouse. The 75 ""Kyoto vs Austin "" menu listed seven courses, with each chef alternating a course. As big Nick Hodge fans, tonight we got what we came for a more upscale version of Icehouse spiced up by Junichi's creative, exotic side.",2
"Awesome service! They let my Korean friends have a taste of almost everything I was full from that! The food was fresh and tasty. The only disappointing part was my garlic rice it could've been more garlicy is that a word? and there were sections that were hard, like 5 day old rice. Yuck. My non Filipino friends really enjoyed the experience. Thanks!",2
I made reservations for a mini van 3 months ago. I get to Thrifty at 1145 pm and they didn't have ANY cars available. Unbelievable. There were 2 customers ahead of me that got turned away and about 10 more behind me. All of us had reservations and all of us were told to catch a taxi to the hotel and come back in the morning. Never using them ever again.,1
"Food is good. Great for happy hour but often extremely crowded . You can see the woman making corn tortillas from scratch. I've only eaten in the bar and during happy hour. The tacos and appetizer platter are very good. The happy hour margarita is a good deal, don't miss Cinco de Taco on the 5th of every month.",2
"Beautiful apartment full of scorpions. Whole complex is invested with scorpions and pests. They don't care and they have a really lousy pest control. When we moved, they tried to charge us for a scorpion infested rug. And they have no security. We were there 2 days, when they had a drive by shooting. Serious crime problem.",1
Stopped by after a quick trip to Bass Pro and ordered a ton of food to take to our hotel. First timer and I like it. We ordered 20 of the meat tacos and several street tacos. The street tacos ain't as good as the taco trucks in Hawaii but it was delicious. The workers here were pleasant. I'd return!,2
"I am not even going to waste my time or your time in going on about how sad this place is. You're better off going to Tabu at MGM, trust me. This place could have such better potential, maybe actually going through all the way with the ""rock "" image. But what do I know? All the nightclubs in Vegas are the same.",1
"What the heck am I missing here? The rice again was ooey and gooey again on my last visit, sticking to the roof of my mouth and having a waxy feel about it . I guess some people like it that way? I was hoping that it was just a fluke the first time but now also the second time. Other people's review I trust give it more stars. I just don't get it.",1
"Love this store and there clearance racks. Found 4 compression shirts, all at 7.93 a piece normally 29.95 and up and all name brand. This store has a great selection and holds more then the stores in henderson and arroyo park. Customer service is always on point as well. Always friendly and courteous to me.",2
"Alors le Dundees, on y va seulement pour un verre quand tous les autres bars potables de la rue Crescent sont bourr u00e9s ou remplis de jeunes tr u00e8s jeunes. nLes cocktails sont corrects mais la nourriture pas du tout, elle est ch u00e8re et de basse qualit u00e9.

"Ok so to start I didn't expect much it's a resturant in the hotel. I figured it would be ok. But no the food wad amazing. Our waiter was ok. But Louis the bust boy was working his a off I have never seen someone work so hard before at a ristorante. We complement mangement and I hope they took us serious, the food was geat but louis really impressed us. I hope to come back soon. goose",2
"I love the Helzberg Store at the San Tan mall, it seems like San Tan hires. younger employees. I have been to this Chandler store 3 times to browse and look for wedding rings. They always seem to have a not so pleasant attitude. When your in the jewelry business you need to find a happy medium between giving your opinion and listening to what the customer wants.",1
The decor is nice. The salad was beautifully described as mixed organic field greens with feta and toasted almonds etc. I would have laughed at how far below the description the salad fell had it not been so pricey. Should have chosen a scone. Oh and I could do without the Christian tunes piping through the entire cafe.,1
"Great food, great atmosphere, great service, reasonable prices and the powdered donuts with raspberry jam are to die for. This was our first time dining here, and it was a very refreshing change from traditional steakhouse dining atmospheres. I almost forgot to mention that the ""Steaks "" are way too tender! LOL , the steaks really are the most tender I have ever ate.",2
"My husband and I went there for our first time today. What a mistake. First of all, the ladies bathroom had no soap or paper towels to wash dry your hands. My husband had the steak sandwich and I had the chicken ranch. There was so little meat on the sandwiches that we were perplexed when we were finished. The inside trash was overflowing. I have been sick to my stomach the last hour.never again.",1
"Way to expensive for bland unoriginal food. I had the Cowboy Burger which had a small dot of BBQ, had to ask for extra. The beef didn't taste fresh and was not well spiced. The staff was attentive but not very friendly. I have no plans on going back. There are much better options out there than an overhyped celebrity named American restaurant.",1
"This is a great company! I have never written a review before, but I am so impressed with this company that I had to write a review. They have excellent customer service they show up on time, call beforehand to let you know they are on their way, installation is quick and clean and the product itself is great. I cannot say enough good things.I highly recommend them!",2
The staff is so unprofessional from the cashiers to the manager. Take your job seriously for once and stop talking like your in a break room! I went to go buy balloons and got the worst customer service ever. And all the manager did was kiss up to every customer that was annoyed. All they do was lay back and relax.,1
I just had Wave House Cleaning Services deep clean my home for the first time.They did a wonderful job! They were friendly and made me feel comfortable having them in my home. They were extremely receptive to my input and truly wanted to do a great job for me. I am so grateful to have found them and will be using them regularly.,2
"It's my first time ordering from the China One near my house. I ordered delivery from them last night, Mu Shu Chicken. Not my usual dish from Chinese restaurants, but I was feeling adventurous. Rice good, cookie good, Mu Shu chicken makes my entire body cringe and convulse! Big ass bug in my meal. Made it to my mouth! I crunched down on this wing thing and it was hard! Big beastly bug! Disgusted!",1
Dissapointed. Filet was dry.for the money you spend.they should serve a better quality. This was our third time different cities of course and I will not frequent the restaurant again.there are to far too many good steakhouses out there to waste my money on this one.one large potato for 11.silly.I am done with them.,1
"I came here on a Saturday afternoon for some Bloody Mary's with a friend. This place is a nice dive bar and surprisingly large in size. Perfect if you want to bring a group and host an event. They have beach volley ball in the back along with another bar. The crowd here comes in a variety as well, it's not like your walking down Mill. Can't wait to come back!",2
"Horrible drive thru service. After placing our order we waited at the window for over 5 minutes with no one completing our order. Lady at the window looked at us but never came over. After going inside we placed a complaint, no we are sorry, no explaination, only a dirty look as though we had done something wrong!",1
"This is one of my ""go to "" restaurants when I want to be assured a good meal. I have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered. Service is consistently good the wait staff don't interrupt conversations just to ask if everything is OK. If you haven't tried 131 Main, you should! PS. Save room for the banana pie. Death by dessert.",2
"Such a great breakfast and brunch spot we frequent this place and LOVE the bloody Mary's, the scrambles omelets are amazing and it's always hard to choose which one to get because I love every one I've ever had. The wait might seem long but they always get us in faster than expected, like magic. Parking is a little tough so go before the rush.",2
I enjoyed it. It was affordable and you go at your own pace. The staff was friendly! It was interesting to learn about the subject. I was hoping for a little more about how the mob was here in vegas vs just about the mob in general. Would definitely recommend and its nice to get away from the crowds a bit.,2
"I just went in because I always hear great things. Definitely lived up to the hype, the crepe I had was amazing. I don't really eat crepes that often but it was the best one I have had, the espresso that I ordered along with it was smooth and well pulled. The staff seems really nice, and they play great music. Ill definitely recommend this place to everyone I know.",2
"Gourmet food at affordable prices! We didn't know what to expect when we went there, but was pleasantly surprised by the food quality and service. Being a new restaurant they have some kinks to work out but as long as you have good food and service, can only get better! Between the 3 of us we split between the new yorker, kalua pork, and tips and taters and they were all fantastic.",2
"Coffee was good. I had the vanilla creamed donut. The ""thimble "" sized amount of cream officially made it a ""cream donut "" I suppose. The stale tasting, dry as a bone, shell officially made it a donut. Honestly, the continuous line in this joint is a true testament to Las Vegans' taste for lousy donuts. I have yet to find a great donut place in Vegas. I will continue my search.",1
"This is definitely a great option for eating or taking out. We've eaten here on many occasions and the food is delicious. This is not a quick dine place, plan on relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere and drinks. We have also have take out here it is packed well and tasty! We love the specialty hummus. The cilantro is my favorite.",2
"I can't stop eating at this place! The owner, Kevin, is awesome and each time I try something new, I fall in love. I never liked Pho and wasn't going to start now with so many other choices for me. However my husband ordered Pho on this trip and GUESS WHO IS GETTING PHO NEXT TIME. This man is a genius with his use of spices and flavors.",2
Terrible WARNING please don't waste your money our steak was 250 bucks tiny full of fat and ice cold GROSS ! I can't believe a new restaurant would be soo disgusting ! Our server was a nice guy and gave us a discount but still it was nasty ! Never again ! Soo many better spots togo to in Vegas for steak !,1
Pink box is brand new in what is quickly becoming a very crowded bakery rich stretch on Murray ave. Pink box is a Chinese bakery with lots of buns. We a each got one. One was like frosting covered and the other was cream filled. All that and they have a cookies and more traditional desserts. I haven't had anything bad from here yet.,2
would not suggest you go here if you are on a tight budget i went to get just a basic wash done exterior only yea it turns out they require at least one special upgrade to go through so i did it because my lexus was really dirty from the dust storm and all the rain the previous day the car came out good cant complain there but come on just wanted to go in and out thats it wtf,1
Checked back in after a hiatus. Had a special of the day pizza which included porcini mushrooms and buffala mozzeralla. no sauce . FANTASTIC. Looks like they spent some additional money upgrading the facilties too. Good to see a local operator that cares enough to keep investing. Will for sure recommend to others.,2
This place is awesome. My boyfriend and I went there and loved this place. The food is perfect. I ordered the turkey chops. But what made it better was that there was a live band that friday night called Snazzi. They were awesome. Great combination of new school and old school and the lead singer was perfect. Her name was Tina. I will be going anywhere they'll be in Charlotte.,2
"My favorite product from Trader Joe's is frozen mushroom tart appetizers. I heat them in the toaster oven and serve my mother in laws homemade pear relish for dipping. They are delish, little savory pie bites from heaven. Sometimes I findT.J.s limiting in their selections, I treat it more like a special treat when I am near one, more than setting out with my grocery list.",2
"Service was slow, food was forgettable. They also seemed to be out of a lot of things on the menu. My burger came out on soggy toast and basically fell apart in my hands, and my wife's ""brioche croque "" looked like it was on a hamburger bun. Apparently they think adding an 'e' to the end of words like salad and soup makes them better. I don't know. Avoid this place for lunch and dinner.",1
Gross food. Bad service. The servers always seem friendly at the beginning and then two hours later when your food hasn't come your realize that you've been had once again by the 'charm' of Macayo's. My friends used to always meet up here my freshman year in college and it always sounded fun but after eating the very low quality food.we all regretted the decision the next morning. Steer clear!,1
It's back to Silver Dragon and it is delicious. Really good Hong Kong style. We got it to go and it was ready very fast. The place was PACKED Friday night when arriving to pick up. Ample portion sizes and very fresh ingredients made for wonderful earing. We got the egg rolls and OH MY were they good crispy outside and cool fresh inside. Amazing and best of all local.,2
"Worst service ever from a server named, Lisa. You'd think at a 30 buffet, some form of liquid would be brought to the table in under a half hour. I've been waiting for my second orange juice for 45 minutes. This is a joke. We'll never be returning here. Food is good but service, at least from this horrible host, is awful. She shouldn't be working here. It's not even crowded.",1
I have a problem with the title on the car I purchased from Cadillac and I've called them many many many times to get the problem solved. Each person I talk to passes the problem on to a Sales Manager. But here is never a Sales Manager there that I can speak with and he or she won't return my call. I guess Customer Service ends the minute the car rolls off their lot!,1
"We heard back from corporate on the terrible treatment we received at this FedEx location in July 2012. I am happy to report he more than made up for it. The person we spoke with listened to us, apologized, refunded our entire bill and said he would speak with the employee. Wow. Thank you FedEx you've won our business back.",2
"I just called to bring in a hard drive for a simple repair PCB board replacement . The guy on the phone insisted that it was IMPOSSIBLE. It is very possible, I just don't have the desire to do it myself right now. I guess I'll be doing it myself or taking it to someone with the skills to actually fix something. I won't ever bring an item to a place that is staffed by such dense people.",1
"Had to rush the order for lunch. I picked the Chicken wrap, it was such an easy item to make, but they managed to find a way to do so. They drenched it with dressing which made the sandwich soggy. It's in the Mandalay Bay, so the price had to be expensive, and it was. I could not complain about the service, it was very good.",1
"Went for dinner and didn't stick around for the club scene. The food was nothing special and very over priced. You go to Vegas and expect to be charged higher than most places, but you also expect a higher quality product. This place did not deliver. I will say the setup and atmosphere were pleasant, but that's where the compliments stop!",1
"F k this place. I used to love it but the drink prices are way beyond nightclub absurd, the girls are as pushy as Rhino which has a better lineup , the ATMs have been broken three times while I've been there, the valet guys are a s holes and generally you're just paying out the a s to be treated like complete s t.",1
"Too far off the strip, average price of a cab to the strip is about 15 each way. There's not a lot of places to eat and the buffet closes at 10pm. nTheir main attraction is ""Thunder from Down Under "".well that fine.if you're into that! We're not and those damn pictures of half naked guys everywhere gets irritating.",1
Horrible please do not go here I went here last year and they cleared our VIP table after we stayed away from the table for a bit and went to the stage. Paid hundreds of dollars and when I threatened to call the manager and or call the cops they had dickest attitude. Would give no car if that place blew up with the bouncers inside. Wannabe gangster mafiosos,1
"The most expensive trip to Vegas. They charge for everything. If you would like to carry on a bag. There is a fee. The fee to check in a carry on while booking flight starts at 25.00. At the kiosk machine 44.00. If you check in the old fashion way 100.00. Wow. Nothing is free not even .peanuts, crackers. The prices may be inexpensive but you make up for it other ways",1
"I was excited about this shop opening for months because it is walking distance from my house. However, since its opening, I have gained a new found appreciation for the WIne and Hop Shop. I mostly don't like that I can't pick out my own yeast and hops they're all behind the counter. I also don't particularly enjoy the personnel, who strike me as being a bit smarmy.",1
"Stopped in yesterday for a couple of G T's. Paid my tab of 9.50 which the receipt indicated was owed and left a tip. The next day a charge showed up as 25.00 to my debit card. Talk about up billing! It is 150 of tab stated on the receipt. Needless to say I won't go back, what a unscrupulous business practice.",1
"I used to love coming here until I came to pick up food for my office building and the staff on the clock didn't know how to use the register and could only accept cash. I had to sit for 20 minutes to wait for the manager to come back from wherever they were to take my card. Thanks, now my food is cold.",1
Best sushi in town. I loooooove the nigri here more hamachi por favor! . This used to be my ex's and my go to restaurant for. really anything and everything. He's left Madisoow but I still stop in regularly. Their lunch special is pretty freaking awesome too Avoid the hot and sour soup but everything else I've had here is great.,2
This place is horrible with customer service! I have come here a couple times at lunch and they have been packed so the host told me to make a reservation for lunch next time I came. I followed her advice and did just that. I came here at the time my reservation was due and our table was not ready. The hostess was snobbish and rude. I will not return here again. Not worth it. Food isn't that great,1
"Absolutely terrible service. Too many people standing around socializing and not servicing. Meal was decent but the appetizer was terrible and after one bite, we left it untouched but were never asked why. Bland food and watered down drinks. I'll even complete their online survey to help them get a clue but wouldn't return for the freebie for doing so.",1
"Another great addition to the growing third wave family in Montreal. Friendly knowledgeable staff serving up te aro on a little 2 group marzocco. Tasty shots, great milk and attention to detail. As others have said, more of a bar than a full cafe, so leave the laptop at home. Take a look on the chalk board where you'll find the day's selection of beans and don't hesitate to chat up your barista.",2
"All I can say is wow! I bought a ticket for myself and my bf. He had such a great time even with our heights phobia, hahah. Doug was our pilot and let me tell you he's one funny man. He makes the ride quite an experience. The landing was super easy. We had a champagne toast and the end. To top it off we had a wonderful breakfast. I would definitely recommend.",2
"Rachel and Andrew are awesome at what they do. I've worked with many great photographers, but I feel that Andrew has a bigger artistic vision of what he's looking for during a shoot and he's good at communicating that! These two have given me some of my favorite photos. Whether you're new at modeling or a pro, I seriously recommend Radiant Inc.",2
"They showed up 20 minutes late at our hour long party, many kids were disappointed that they could not get their face painted nI tried to call them several times to find out what was happening and nobody answered. Nobody has contacted me to apologize, nUnfortunately I had not seen previous reviews on this service, it seems that been late is normal for them nI would not recommend them",1
"Three words. Macaroni and cheese. Gooey, cheesy deliciousness. Yeah, the bar area is nice and colorful. Big screens everywhere and nice booth seating. Waitstaff was quick, friendly.and accurate. Price was nice. yeah, yeah. Their Macaroni and cheese is a penne pasta with diabetes causing cheese glue sauce. golden brown crispy crumbly goodness sprinkled on top. Enjoy.",2
"I ordered the chicken kabob on pita and that is all I got. No veggies, no nothing. Marinated chicken with fatty bits laying on a whole wheat pita. It was gross. nAlso unpleasant the key to the womens restroom is on giant table leg so the guy working there can make some joke in front of the entire restaurant when he hands it to you. No thanks, I'm not amused.",1
"Spicy hot is a very subjective thing. Arriba's dishes are made with Hatch chilis from New Mexico. For the lightweights, they have a heat scale next to the chili items. They can't make their food too hot for me. Everything I've had here has been good. Service is usually good, but have had a couple of issues with the service in the past. I've been to the Chandler and Scottsdale locations.",2
"Great place for drinks and fun! They have a nice patio out back and seating outfront, large on the inside. They have excellent drink specials and a good amount of TVs to watch the games. They have pool, corn hole, skee ball, basketball and a few other games, also have a checkers bar so you can sit drink and play. Their food is decent, I usually stick to burgers wings.",2
I ordered a pizza on the phone.the price was 10.95 when I went to pick it up I gave them a coupon for 5.00 off I was charged 12.82 which was more than it should have been even without the coupon.why oh why I live around the corner from this place and we have flyers in the lobby from them.I guess I will have to tell them to remove them,1
Stopped in with the family before I flew up to Vegas and was really disappointed. I stopped in because this is one of those places I really wanted to check out but I wish I'd stuck with the actual restaurant. It really doesn't translate well to airport. Food was so so at the very best. Service was slow and seemed inconvenienced.,1
"Super cute cafe in an out of the way location. I ordered a turkey wrap and while the wrap itself was really basic, it was delicious. Very fresh ingredients eliminated the necessity for fancy pants ness. My only complaint was that my chai was so sweet that I wasn't able to drink it. As other reviews have mentioned, it was quite empty so I hope the word gets out. Or not. ",2
"Angel and the rest of the girls at ""Scent From Above "" were absolutely amazing. They cleaned my home I just put on the market and it is definitely MOVE IN READY. The buyers will be happy to not have to do a thing but move in nI would recommend ""Scent From Above "" to all of my friends and co workers.",2
"I get my eyes checked about 1 time a year, sometimes once ever 2 years. Lucky me has perfect vision. I see Dr. Maury Kessler. Nice man. Wish I had more to say It is a really nice office space and the people working there seem really friendly. Now I know my vision is going to be flawed for my next check up simply b c I said I have perfect vision.",2
"Very nice service. Very family friendly restaurant. We went after church on a Sunday. Lots and lots of choices on the menu. Lots of Asian people eating here good sign right?! My kids had chickeoodle soup, Kung Pao Chicken and lo meioodles. They loved all of it. I think the lo mein was the biggest hit with them. My mixed vegetables were somewhat bland but fresh and edible.",2
Excellent excellent excellent! I ordered the Jalape u00f1o Chicken and it was absolutely amazing. Extremely flavorful and just tbe right amount of food Our server Danny is excellent as well. Very friendly and he took the time to answer all of our questions thoroughly and in detail. I would definitely recommend this spot,2
"Small menu but it packs a yummy punch! The chicken is outstanding, huge portion and chicken is super juicy! I wish they offered some sort of veggie just for the option of a balanced meal but I suppose if you go for Chicken Waffles, you don't usually think of having your daily veg with it. Yummy and worth a try!",2
"Walked into Jimmy John's at 6pm on 10 31 to see a man with a large dog waiting for food at the pickup end of the counter. The dog was not a seeing eye dog, or one in training. Dog had its front feet up on the counter, and the people behind the counter were talking to the dog. Pretty disgusting for food being prepared 1 or 2 feet away. No thanks.",1
"My first trip to my local TJ's proved AWESOME! Jeff is a great, energetic cashier and is always able and willing to help. For example, I once grabbed a thing of Roma Tomatoes and when we rang it up, we found they had spoiled. Without question or contest, he tossed them out and ran and grabbed me a new container. 5 stars all the way!",2
"Just got back. I had the grilled vegetable salad. It was small and didn't have enough dressing. The waitress didn't come back to see how everything was till we were done. My friend had the grilled chicken. Nothing special. Kind if foo foo food. Not a big fan. Food was fair, service poor. Wont go back.",1
"After reading reviews of this place I decided to give it a try. I am VERY picky when it comes to how my nails are done. I like them a certain way and the nail tech, Kevin, was amazing! He asked me how I wanted them, what I was expecting, the whole deal. And the best part was the price. Only 35 for a brand new full set of acrylics! I will be back!",2
"We still frequent the Matador when we get to that part of town, and they are STILL amazing. Sarah, I believe is the owner of the place, and she is always working hard, and always remembers us. Still love them, have never ever had a bad experience with any of the staff or any of our drinks or food. YUM!",2
"Condescending staff at reservation desk, rude waitress nGreat mac n cheese appetizer nTuna tacos were overly salty and inedible nSalmon was cooked well but the seasoning on the kimchi was odd and distracting nVery overrated restaurant nSpend your money at one of Pittsburgh's better restaurants with more considerate staff",1
I went here for the first time tonight as it is right down the street from my place. Delicious locally made ice cream and freshly made waffle cones are as good as it gets. The Super Farm and Cookies n Cream ice creams are my favorites. Will definitely be taking many trips back to this spot this summer.,2
I went to the Herb Box for the first time on 12 2 with a group of ladies for brunch. I had the chilaquiles and it was delicious. They also had bottomless mimosas with the option of mango or orange juice. I got mango and it was yummy. Our waitress was very pleasant. She split our check we were a party of 14 without a hassle. I would highly recommend The Herb Box.,2
"If you want to watch t.v. and enjoy a cold beer, Zipps is fine. If you want good food, go elsewhere. There is much better bar food to be had at almost anywhere. nOnion Rings.very oily nFrench Fries.Fresh cut, but they come out very soggy and poor flavor. nGreen Chili Burger.Decent nWings.Okay Service has been very slow all three times I have been here.",1
We just moved to the Surprise area and wanted to try out local pizza places. We got a menu in the mail from this place so we gave it a shot. Delivery took over an hour for just one pizza and one order of cheese sticks. The pizza was not good and all it was a simple pepperoni and cheese thin crust. Most likely will not reorder from this place again.,1
"My first ever Five Guys experience was at this location. The staff was quick, friendly and efficient. They had customer service down to a science. the food was great and the drink stations never lacked in anything. The only problem was with the seating.it was hard to move your chair and not accidentally bump into somebody else. But I think it was because I visited this place on a weekend.",2
"Great for kids of all ages. Free circus shows every few minutes. Is it me or were the shows dominated by Russian people? The games were fun and easy to win too. Unlike the county fairs its not like you have to drop 10 just to win a small toy either. Unless you really suck or have horrible luck, you'll be able to win some sort of prize.",2
"This place has the worst customer service. They would give you a hard time if you ask why your food takes so long to come. They yelled at me when i asked for a tea cup and sort of throw it to my face. And be aware, tips are included in your bill. Would you pay 15 tips for that kind of service? I would never come back to this place.",1
"Alright, I am bumping Sens up to a four star. I tried the Mint Shrimp and was floored. Uh Mazing! The serving is small, two pieces, so order two. The Fried Wontons did not disappoint once again. I tried an unfiltered sake. This was great as well. Our server was attentive and fast. I can see them going to a 5 star with another visit or two.",2
"Huge menu, fresh tasty food, reasonable prices. Beats a chain highway place for sure. The chicken dumpling soup alone is worth a trip fresh made every day and it caused my vegetable phobic daughter to eat carrots and celery of her own voltion! the steak cut French fries were great and the coconut cream pie was wonderful.",2
"We had not been here for a couple of years. The food used to be great. Not anymore. Bad service. Horrible food. When we complained to the manager that the egg rolls were cold, his response was yeah right they were made in the 1st batch earlier on. Well how about the food. Same response. The place was in shambles as well.",1
Well I can't really comment on their food or their service. We decided to order from them one evening but the guy told us it would take over an hour and he sounded like we were really inconveniencing him. So we told him to forget about it. I don't mind waiting over an hour but I'd like a little courtesy over the phone.,1
"more like 3 1 2 stars. this hotel has come a long way.they remodeled all the rooms, which was very clean, modern, and comfy. it was only 69 a night b c I got a deal. It is only a 5 min walk to the Wynn, which was great b c they have great food there. The bad thing bout TI is that all the food in this hotel sucks.",2
"eh location is good and the lunch special is cheap 8 for two rolls and soup or salad , but you could probably do just as well with grocery store rolls. It's usually busy and can be fun for groups for this reason, but don't expect to be impressed the unique rolls are expensive and the rest are boring and average.",1
"So I'd love to write a great review but I'm elsewhere eating dinner and drinking beers. Why? Because my friend and I both women could not justify paying a 5 cover to see a fight that 1. We could careless about. 2. Could see up the street for free 3. Could have parked in the parking lot and watched. So, sorry to say we will be spending our money and tipping well here at Gordon Biersch.",1
"Food are ok but they have the best ube boba tho. I use to work here like 2 years ago and I decided just to order something that doesnt involve them cooking because truthfully they dont wash the dishes correctly, they reuse the sanitize water over and over even if it had some food in it. YUCK! I am sorry.",1
"My husband and I recently tried Rita's after so many friends raved about it. nWe were so so disappointed. The combined outside patio area with a group singing so loud we couldn't hear each other in a conversation. The food and Margaritas we fair, the constant fly's made it difficult to relax and enjoy the atmosphere. nNot a fan.",1
"They did a WONDERFUL job caring for my pups while I made a quick trip back to NashVegas. Brittany taught Toffee how to fetch AND to bring the ball back! She created a monster. but, I'm good with it. Prices are reasonable for the service they provide. And, they are so kind and friendly! I HIGHLY recommend them.",2
"I just tried this place for lunch today and it was fantastic. The guacamole was so fresh and chunky, the tostadas were crisp, the tacos were super flavorful, and the service was great. I can't wait to go back at night when I can try one of the margaritas with their huge selection of tequila seriously, it, like, takes up the whole back page of their menu .",2
"It was all right. My boyfriend had a craving for fish and chips, but we were too lazy to drive anywhere. This place delivered, and it delivered fast about half an hour. The fries were too salty, and the dinner came with three small pieces of fish. I would like to try a pizza off their menu sometime, since those sound good.",1
"I remember coming to Popo's in the 90's and it was tha shiz! I'm not sure why I liked it so much. Maybe the recipe's changed since then, but it really isn't as great as it used to be. It might be that my palate has matured with all the great Mexican food I get in San Diego or maybe the thrill is just gone.",1
"I have been here twice and both times the waiter has made the experience great! The food is very good and fairly priced, but Joe our waiter, made the experience great! nI got the Pad Thai and the my girlfriend got the duck. Both excellent. The first time we got the red curry chicken and the pad see u. Both fantastic. The Basil rolls are awesome too. nThanks Joe!",2
"Called ahead and put our name in and were told 25 35min. Ok, time to drive there get gas on the way. Showed up 25min later and they told us 25 45min wait. What?! Not so brilliant hostess says your wait time was cut in half! This service didn't meet any expectations. Fuzzy math left us laughing as we eat at Charleston's next door with no wait.",1
"We stopped by briefly this evening to see what changes Restoration Hardware have made in the new location, but left somewhat disappointed. There's still no color here, just beige, off white, oyster, etc. The old Restoration Hardware is gone, now it's a furniture housewares store which carries only. beige, off white, oyster furniture. Ugh. We give up.",1
"This location is really friendly. They offer the free tire air check, and have no issues with someone who has NO idea what they're talking about when it comes to cars. Not that I'm talking about me.no way. BUT if I was talking about me, I would say that I've never been overcharged at Discount Tire, and everyone is always so nice and happy to be of service.",2
"NOT THAT SPECIAL nfor the insane prices I expected insanely good food but no it was only OK, my husband's steak was was just that and when they prepare it with peppercorn it is way overpowering all you can taste is the pepper no meat, My ""freshest sea food in AZ "" was a little dry. all in all it was fine but not for the price we definitely wont be going back",1
"I was a customer for approx 16 yrs. Only because they were my only option. Came home one day to find out they had cut off my service because I had a balance of 28.00. It was gonna be 150 and 2 wks before I could get it turned back on. Needless, to say I told them to bite me and welcomed DirecTV which I love. !",1
Fantastic food and great service. Had reservations on a Sunday night and all the staff members was very attentive to our table. Every dish we had was mouth watering. The tuna tataki was so delicious. The Sao Paulo roll is unlike any sushi I've tried the blend of flavors and texture is so tasty. Even the drinks we had were very good. I'm looking forward to going back next time I'm in town.,2
This is a normal Fry's Marketplace that is currently undergoing a remodel. Spacious aisles and friendly workers many times I've been asked how I was doing or if I needed any assistance. Generally good prices permitting that you have a Fry's card and with that said you can use your phone number that is one file if you don't want to carry the card around I'm somewhat of a minimalist .,2
"Receptionist was extremely vague in available times for a blowout and was unprofessional gave the impression that the facility did not want to work past a certain time. Could be that facility did not have enough stylists which in effect, means it is likely not prepared to provide convenient services for women.",1
"While Dobra Tea is absolutely beautiful inside, the male owner is rude and unfriendly, and the wifi has not worked for me I'm a grad student, and need to do homework there . Te Cafe right across the street has way better customer service and their tea is equally as good if not better . I've given this place three tries, and will not be going back.",1
This place is a joke. And I ain't laughing. Came here with the family. Sat down another family party of six sat down after us. Got there order first and corn bread. Water. And table set ups while I watched her give out to go orders. Then I got fed up watching this nonsense and told her I'm ready to order. Took way too long horrible customer service. what can I expect from a place like this.,1
Good food horrible service. I expect top notch service when dining at supposedly top notch restaurant. Sat our group at a table that was practically falling off of the hinges. We were offered to move to a smaller set of tables where we all sat in a line versus a circle.so we declined. Called the manager over and he was at best indifferent. Taking my business somewhere else next time.too bad,1
"This place bridges the gap between Costco and Metcalfs for people who want nice things but can't afford them. More importantly, they have one of the best alcohol selections in town their bourbon selection is as good if not better than Steve's, and theyve got a ton of local and regional beers. Good stuff.",2
Came here for lunch. Was greeted and seated promptly. Everyone was extremely warm friendly. Our waitress was fantastic! Wish I remembered her name. The food was fresh good. Also didn't take too long despite the place being full. My favorite thing about this place was the decor! Very fun authentic old Vegas atmosphere. Love coming at night as the fire pits are lit. Love this place.,2
"The wait sucks.so i recommend you go as early as possible. Portions are HUGE. No better place for breakfast and brunch than here. Had the Andy Sage Fried Chicken Mahthingy, and the meatloaf and eggs. Freakin sooooo goood. Service is good considering how busy they are. Food is fairly fast. You will leave happy. Cant wait to go back this month. Vegas baby.",2
"Started out with wedding soup that was so salty it was almost inedible. Asked for the house wine and was given a glass of wine that cost 9.00. My fault, I should have asked, I guess. Meals were OK, but nothing special. Even the bread was just so so. My dinner partner and I both got entirely different meals, and we both experienced serious gastro intestinal problems after our dinners.",1
"I can't speak highly enough about this place. It's a good thing so many positive reviews have come before me, because I'm so stuffed with Laotian goodness right now that I can barely think straight! nThe staff is courteous and down to earth, most are native Lao. The American servers do a good job of letting customers know what best appeals to a Western pallet.",2
"Wasn't really in the mood for sushi after a long week in Vegas working a trade show, but my pal saw Kaizen in Yelp, and insisted we go. Quiet at 8ish on a Wed. evening thankfully woulda had NO patience for a loud party scene that night . The drinks were great and the food was remarkable fresh, beautifully presented, unusual combinations all delish. I will definitely return!",2
I love this place! I love how clean and organized the store is. Normally stores like this are a complete mess and I feel like I'm browsing through someone's messy closet. The quality of clothing is still great with prices that are more affordable. There are a ton of styles to choose from and they constantly get new merchandise in. Love it!,2
I have been to a few Little Caesars locations over the years and this particular one is the worst. I have been here twice and they are so cheap on the ingredients. THEY SKIMP on the cheese and toppings compared to other locations. If you have to go to Little Caesars.avoid this location and drive a little further! Whoever owns this particular franchise location is a cheap piece of s ,1
"HUGE salads. You can have your pita without the bread and eat it too! The roast beef here is GREAT. I came in at lunch and it took forever to get thru the line. Order was taken quickly, but then to actually get to my order took like 15 minutes, and by then she had forgotten what I ordered. But. the salad I got was worth it.",2
"I'm so confused by all the rave reviews. I was craving a donut and I'd kept hearing about Bosa, so I made a run. Tried the chocolate raised donut and a glazed donut hole. I'm beyond disappointed.I've had better donuts at the gas station! Besides being mediocre at best, they left an awful aftertaste that wont go away! Bummer.",1
Today I was denied entrance in SAMs club and I have spent well over millions of dollar in the past 9 year I have had my business witch is mind boggling and I know Most of the employees and friendly with them but this shows u that big corporations do not care about us small mom and pop business and the consumers that bring in money,1
"I have a gluten allergy, not gluten friendly. I just wanted to order the burger pattie and bacon and the server was informed by their manager that they will have to charge me for the entire burger but I am not wanting the lettuce, tomato, pickle, cheese, and fries. Why do I have to pay the full price?!",1
"Carne asada burrito. Carne asada tacos. Tortas. And watermelon Aguas frescas. I don't think I've ordered anything here that wasn't good. This is a great place for high quality mexican food, that isn't too expensive. The only downside is there is always a wait, but grab a drink at the bar and set your view to the pool where you can view a waterfall wall of wonder.",2
"Do not come here to eat. This is a nice place for drinks and decent music, but the food service was awful. The prices were outrageous, even for Montreal standards. The quality of the food was very poor and the waiter seemed inconvenienced that he was serving us. This was relatively early in the dinner service and the place was only about 50 full, so there was no reason for the poor service.",1
"This was the first time I ever just threw away food I had ordered. It was thoroughly disgusting. Brown overcooked slop. And it took twice as long as they said it would. I ordered Ma Po Tofu, and my wife ordered the Beef with Garlic Sauce. Both basically tasted and looked the same. Words don't really describe how gross this food was.",1
"Thanks so much Mike and Jay. You did a great job on my car. I love it when I can refer a friend knowing that they will receive exceptional service. You guys are so professional and do such a great job explaining all of my options. As soon as I purchase my home, I will have you do my residential windows also.",2
"My wife and I had a bad experience at this location right before we went to watch ""The Phantom. "" The pasta with marinara sauce was pretty tasteless, the seating arrangement is tight and the place is pretty small. I recommend that users go to Grand Lux Cafe over Valentinos, Grand Lux is open 24hrs a day as well.",1
"The wireless router I rent from Cox was getting flaky, so I packed it up and headed over to this location to get it replaced. There were tons of staff to help, they didn't ask me a bunch of questions, and I was in and out with a new wireless router in literally, 3 minutes. Great experience, particularly compared to Comcast, where I almost killed myself once.",2
"Everything was freaking delicious and the service was excellent. It is priced fairly, in my opinion, and the dudes working here are super cool. They asked us how the food was, and we had some short, funny conversations with the owner worker as well. nPortions are huge! There will probably be a wait, so while you wait, you will salivate!",2
"Called at 7pm, they are open till 11pm, nI was told they are not delivering, I live a 20 minute walk away from this store, the weather is clear, i called the last 2 days and the same thing at different times, nThey have a track record of closing early, and not delivering past 8 pm, back when i ordered more regulry, i don't recommend this place unless you are desperate!",1
"Ordered the veggie pizza, came on time for a great price for something with no flavor. Cheese had a plastic consistency and the crust was bland. Sauce was also very plain. It seemed like the vegetables even forgot how they're supposed to taste. Fried zucchini was good though, whatever they did to the zucchini they should do to the pies.",1
"I have replaced 2 CV axles on 2006 Honda Odyssey last only 4 months then had a leak I brought my van back for repair then told me it's loose on the clamp they will re tight the clam but, They never re tight on my 2006 Honda Odyssey. Never go back that place again. the worst auto service every see in AZ.",1
One of the best places I have been to in a long time. Not just the fresh food the staff is the best in valley. The seafood is flown in fresh every few days from around the globe. If you want FRESH Seafood and the best service this is the place to visit. The place is packed for dinner most nights some come early and enjoy some of the best fresh seafood in the valley.,2
"By far the juiciest most flavorful burger I have ever had, better than my previous favorites BLT burgers and Holstien's Burger and Bun, which are fine burgers in their own right! Farm Burger is outstanding, Hell's Kitchen Burger also first rate! You can tell it's great food when it just gets better bite after bite! Great service we were pampered!",2
I had a great experience at Verde today from my reception when I walked in through my color cut with Austin! She did an amazing job making my gray streaks into a warm chocolate I love it! Everyone there really seemed to like being there and the work environment seems very warm and welcoming. I will definitely make this my new salon.,2
Place was recommended to us by a staff member at the Hard Rock. Thank you ! nI am pretty sure the mahi mahi fish taco was the best I have ever had. I also got a shrimp taco just as delicious. My husband said his 4 were off the hook. Great selection of Microbrew beers on tap Homerun ! Friendly helpful staff and very good prices.,2
Excellent selection and extremely knowledgable staff. Make sure you check the web site prices vs. the in store price. I went to buy a Lasermax center fire for my LC9 which I purchased a couple of months earlier at Hyatts. The in store price was 50 above the web price. Ultimately they honored the web price but I had to prove it to them.,2
First time ever there! Ordered a salad with apples and cranberries among other things.no apples in the salad.what's the point of paying extra for a salad if you are not getting what is supposed t o be in it? Never again! I hate rip offs! P.s. Their french fries suck.my husband ordered them and their hamburgers were not even thick!,1
"First the cons Yes, the decor is dated. With full on Italian music playing. And it was a little pricey for a neighborhood Italian place. But it gets 4 stars because the food was really good and the service. Everyone there was very friendly and warm, and they really seemed to care that you enjoy your meal.",2
My boyfriend and I got takeout here on New Years Eve. We both got a bowl of traditional Pho and loved it. Everything was separated into perfect portions on the side so it was ready to throw together when we for home. We also got a fantastic Panang curry dish. We will definitely come back to try other items on the menu.,2
"Stopped in here for lunch today, joined by Robyn N. Mike C. It's just a mid sized cafe sort of a place, but I thought my meal was terrific! I had an Alligator Po Boy fries well done . It was the first time I had ever tried alligator, it was delicious, as was the whole sandwich. The fries were tops too. a generous serving, crispy outside not greasy. Alligator Po Boy Fries 9.50 Yum! ",2
"LOL, it's called The Cup and they have the WORST CUPS EVER! I live at Veer Towers which is right around the corner, so I gave the place three chances. All three times, I laughed and said to myself, ""Never again. "" The cups leak from right under the top. Also, the coffee is subpar and super expensive. 4 for a 16ounce. For realsies this time, NEVER AGAIN!",1
"I don't get this place. First Chicks don't like to go to a place where girls are being hosed down with water. Why would I want to see a girl in a bikini look like she's showering without soap in front of me? I get that guys are all about this, but no. don't do that. Second Why the hell would an artist be painting in a night club. I just don't get you Myst!",1
"Some awful, awful service. After an incorrect order, the replacement order took 20 minutes to come out. It was a waffle. Server was also rude when we asked about that replacement waffle. Nobody stopped by asking if we'd like anything, no coffee refills. The food was the one redeeming quality it was all tasty. If you dare to brave the lack of service, get the crunchy French toast.",1
"You can't do much better for breakfast in Surprise than Nick's. Every time I go in I have to hold back from ordering something I clearly won't be able to finish.and where to start?!?! I'd do a poor job embellishing on what others have written all I'll say, is that you like a cooked breakfast, eat here! nom nom nom. ",2
"Co worker recommended it, so i stopped by and order chicke waffle.I'm really disappointed and I'm not coming back here. first to pricey 1pc chicke 1 lousy waffle for 10.50 to much. It's OVERPRICED! Then i have to wait for 30 min. For a chicken waffe.UNBELIEVABLE! Just go to IHOP better pancake ot to pricey!",1
"Holy balls. In N Out does NOT disappoint! This was my first time at In N Out and it was so good we came here twice on our 4 day trip in Arizona. Double Double Animal style is the way to go. It is the perfect mix of a study yet not too hard bun, tons of crunch lettuce tomato pickles, grilled onions are so tasty and the mix of the cheese and spread are SO GOOD. Definitely a must try!",2
"The corned beef hash made me feel good about eating here, no cans allowed. Then I had the Lobster and Jack cheese omelet. The lobsters were fresh caught from Lake Mead earlier this morning. They had to open two more locations to handle the hungry throng of diners anxiously awaiting the best breakfast grub this side of the Rockies. Ask for Terri, she'll treat you right.",2
"I would give this place no stars or negative stars if possible. Horrible service, place is filthy, and the wait time is ridiculous! What a joke. For that price you think you were getting gourmet food! I got a stale, wilted salad and a overseasoned, soggy chicken fraco. And their ""specialty "" drink, is juice with club soda so they can charge an arm and a leg?! Never again!",1
"12inches of Bobbie goodness! The sandwich cost 8.65. This place is a bit more expensive than other Capriotti's because of the location inside of the Red Rock Hotel. The Bobby is Thanksgiving on a hoagie! Roast turkey, mayo, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. My go to sandwich. Naps are optional but encouraged.",2
"Organized a business breakfast here and was impressed by how attentive and efficient the service was. We were seated at a great table facing the windows. I really liked the little chair they offered for purses, too cute. I had the duck hash eggs which was delicious, although the pancakes looked great too. Tableau is perfectly classy and elegant, yet casual at the same time.",2
"Good bar food at reasonable prices. OK bar atmosphere. Management seems nice and greeted me personally but the bartender really didn't seem to be enjoying herself. It was a slow afternoon when I went there for lunch. She offered no water refills, had to be flagged down whenever I needed anything, was only paying attention to her regulars, and never checked to see if I was happy with the food.",1
"This company is awesome! Our service guy was Craig which is a subcontractor of Jeff and he was amazing! He truly gave great customer support and helped us with every aspect we needed! I used this company based on everyone else's great reviews and had to, too share their recommendation with others! I recommend this company above any others!",2
I was looking for a new BBQ joint for a while now and I spotted Andrews BBQ I entered the restaurant really clean and friendly staff. I ordered the BBQ sandwich includes 1 side dish. Slider Trio pork beef chicken Green chile macaroni and cheese. The Andrews spicy BBQ and the regular BBQ sauce were really good. Really good BBQ great prices will be back for sure.,2
"I have been coming here for 20 years and I have never had a bad meal. This place is incredible. The prices have hardly changed in all these years. The food is super fresh and very authentic. They also have a grocery store located in the same building with everything you could want and imagine from middle eastern food, beverages and spices. They're big gyros sandwiches are around 3 dollars.",2
"Came here on a Friday night and was pleased it wasn't busy. Food was good but the customer service was some of the worst I've experienced. In fact, the only reason I'm being generous with two stars is because the food was decent. I'm almost certain the woman serving us was completely wasted too. All in all, the experience here was garbage and I won't be back here again.",1
"Okay I am ashamed to admit I eat here at least twice a week, but it's almost justifiable with the lard free beans and fresh ingredients! Though I must say the service can sometimes be questionable, it's WORTH it and Im a HUGE stickler about service so. ! My must have, bean and cheese burrito ADD their famous carne asada with guacamole! And warning the chips and salsa may be habit forming ",2
This is probably the worst company I've ever had to deal with. To arrange a pick up of their containers is nearly impossible task for them and requires lots of phone calls and patience on the customer part without any guarantee of success. Save your time and nerves and avoid dealing with this company.,1
"My review is about the service department. Talked to an a hole about a recall on my truck. Gave him my vin and apparently letters and numbers were to difficult for him to type on the computer. All I can say is what an idiot and never will I ever bring my business to you guys anymore! Because of one person who has no knowledge on customer service, you just lost a loyal customer!",1
Great cafe for brunch and coffee. Lots of vegetarian options and nice atmosphere. Come check out the place if you're in the area and would like to try some healthy foods. Was here for some brunch with friends and our food did take a while to make it to the table but everyone enjoyed their meal. If you come too late during the evenings for dinner the food options are less then what's on the menu.,2
"Overpriced. Nice staff, in spite of having to listen to the owner or whoevers stupid self produced ""country "" music all night. That didn't help the dining experience much at all I was annoyed after 15 minutes, I can't imagine having to listen to that all the time. The walk home through the silent construction dinosaurs on Willy street at night was more interesting than the food.",1
"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in All of East AZ. The fish is fresh. They are fast,efficient, authentic, and polite. This atmosphere is conducive to a family and while the location is in a strip mall of sorts do not let that deter you in any way from getting awesome Sushi. I highly recommend it .",2
Went here this morning for breakfast and was verry satisfied with the customer service but the food was not very good! I had the chicken fried steak and the meat was over cooked and the gravy tasted like flour and had clumps of something in it! Will probably not be back! I'll stick with egg works lol,1
"I've gone many times. The bartenders are awesome and very personable, and the staff all together are great! Chase and Alex are the best bartenders, and they have really really good food. Chicago style and really good. Also they have shuffle board, darts, and 2 pool tables with an outside area. Really big spot.",2
"Where to begin? nThe staff is cold and uninviting. Rolling eyes at the inconvenience of patrons trying to navigate past servers, searching various corridors trying to find the bathroom. Design architecturally is fine. Very current. The atmosphere at the bar was horrendous. Vulgar. Drunks. If you are a twice divorced post middle age slightly overweight dude. this is your place. Enjoy.",1
"As with most Wendy's, this one was busy and got the food to you. I went at lunch, and most of the workers were very on top of their game. Of course, the woman behind the counter made my name totally wrong because she couldn't read my debit card. I was right there, ask me my name. Anyway, other than that it was great.",2
"Wasn't too impressed with this tea shop. The herbal iced tea I had wasn't that great, and they did not include boba in the drink despite asking for it at the register. My friend's iced tea took forever to make 10 15 minutes or so and she wasn't too happy with the taste of it either. She said the boba wasn't very good so perhaps it's best that I didn't have any in my drink anyways.",1
"This place is hit or miss. I work in the South Side so it's probably the only reason I go there. Their customer service sucks half the time, its very inconsistent. You are never sure what you are going to get, it all depends on who is working. But on the other hand, they do get the job done, so it will do until I find the time to find a new place, I'll continue to go here",1
"This Starbucks is the ideal spot for grabbing a coffee on your way to your uptown office or for a business meeting outside the office. It's open surprisingly late most non bar establishments shut down once the banks do. So if you find yourself uptown late on a Friday or Saturday night and you're just looking for a place to chill, you can head there, grab a latte and people watch until 11 30 pm.",2
Ordered several of the dishes for dinner. Despite my communication hiccups with the wait staff the dishes that try brought out were phenomenal. If you like spicy food then get the fried rice cake with chili. The Mongolian beef was sweet but pretty good. All the other dishes were authentic n but keep in mind the portions are large so order like you would family style,2
"They use hydrogenated oils by the truck load, nothing more to say but I will go on. The food is eh and the portions are huge. Is it really necessary to add a billion grms of fat in everything, especially Genetically Modified oils that are completely unneeded. If your food is any bit fresh than get that gross trans fat out of there Your service is soo to fyi",1
"Worst Nightclub ever, let me tell you about my experience. First of all its way to expensive 40 to get in the club and the line is too long. Its too packed inside and the drinks are expensive. To top everything, the bouncers get power hungry and push people out of the way for no reason. I would strongly recommend that you will never come here.",1
"I was a bit hesitant from the looks outside and that there was not a lot of patrons inside so I passed, but came back the night after. Come to find out, the patrons are mostly Indian good sign , the food was delicious, I had the fish masala spicy with rice, onioaan, plus tamarind mint chutney, everything was great, service was more 'human' than other restaurants on the strip, prices were not bad.",2
"Strong drinks, dark and smoky, cozy booths, great juke box. This is a bar, this is your neighborhood bar. If you need to meet someone for a drink and just talk it out this is the place. A good friend of mine always points out the ugly carpet. Yep, the carpet here is ugly, but at least it is new. And the place is dark so you never really see the carpet anyways.",2
"This is one of the better buffets in Vegas. It was surprisingly priced at about 28 per person. I swore I paid more for this place before or it might've been that we came here on a Sunday night. The food selection was abundant unlike most buffets. They had foods from various cultures like Chinese, Mexican, American, etc.",2
"This is good Mexican food. The family ate here for a birthday. Everyone like the food. They speak of returning. That's pretty near to a miracle in my little universe. The chips were thin, crispy and delicious, the salsa warm, not scorching but as I said in my check in, probably not suitable for the average Canadian. The Sonora Enchilada is an excellent vegetarian meal here. We're coming back.",2
"I love Pier 1, they have some of the cutest xmas decorations at all different price points. This year I got some adorable ornaments and then some other decor for my end tables, and I had to restrain myself from just piling more into my basket. There regular merchandise is really nice as well, and they have some great looking, but priceyish furniture.",2
"I lived in Madison for a couple years. Now that I have moved away, there are a couple things that I sincerely miss. Sausages from Bavaria Sausage Inc are some of those things. This place is amazing. It is outside the main part of the city, but it isn't too far away. Do yourself a favor and purchase some delicious tubular meats from these guys. The cheese is pretty tasty as well.",2
One star is too kind. Slow service most of the time. Old tall thin lady slowest of all. Moves like she has all day. Didn't know the meaning of convenience store. It doesn't mean customers have all day to wait for your slow service. Move with some haste why don't you. QuikTrip is so far better. Like living in the white house vs. A trailer park.,1
"This place is boring and tries way too hard. The menu is limited. I had the ""pigstrami "" sandwich. It was ok, not great. I ordered the side salad but the brought me fries. They couldn't leave the ketchup alone, it was gross because they tried to make it special. I will never go back because there are too many other great options in the area.",1
"Always great. It's a restaurant that is consistent and that is to be valued above all else. It is one thing to say, ""let's go eat there, "" but a whole other thing to say, ""let's go eat there again. "" They always have my family saying that. nThe mussels with the white wine sauce is fantastic, best enjoyed with one of their belgian brews. Was a great place that can be enjoyed time and time again.",2
"Vibe is good and it's clean, people are nice. However both mine and my husbands food lacked flavor. The gyro meat tasted boiled and salty not fresh. For 30 we left with carryout with one small bag. The same order at our previous spot in NV would have given us lots of extras. Even another nearby spot would have given much more on portions. Just disappointed because I love Greek food",1
There are VERY incompetent workers especially Angel Rodriguez. Extremely rude and unable to complete the simplest of tasks. I called to look up a part and got there to pick it up but they didn't have it due to looking up the wrong part over the phone. NO WONDER THEY ARE HIRING. THEIR CURRENT STAFF IS SHIT!,1
"I am obsessed with this place! I have had their breakfast bowls, protein bowls, salads, protein shakes, and juices and I have never been dissatisfied! Food is affordable and delicious and the Scottsdale location has a great set up. I love everything about Chop Show and I recommend it to anyone and everyone!",2
"Best happy hour in Las Vegas! Wow! Great service, food and atmosphere. Lisa the bartender was awesome! She made some great happy hour suggestions and you can tell the manager Gary cares about the dining experience of all the guests. All locals are treated very well. Let them know. Happy Hour is Monday Thursday 4 7 and Friday Sunday 4 6. The Lava cake is the best!",2
"We really enjoyed the Van Gogh Live presentation they have of his paintings this month. Other then that, I really do not care too much about this place. I actually find the AZ Science Center as one big headache. Lots of walking around.for nothing really. Yeah, this is how electricity is made they tell you but if that's not your thing.you will be bored.",2
"Eggs are bad other food is pretty good. This place is nothing special, they try and are friendly but the eggs are gross, as is the coffee. Home Fries and such are pretty decent. The atmosphere is nice and homey and very country. Seats are comfortable and no real complaints. But for the most part the food is bad. I will not return intentionally",1
"Overall was very disappointed the good nservice is good, waiter and servers were friendly and prompt with food. the bad nthe meat was overcooked mostly ndecor needs updating nkind of pricey for the quality Spent 100 with tip for two drinks, two meals, bottled water nonly one guy brings around the meat.seemed awfully rushed",1
"Food is so good, portions are good! Best egg rolls. Want food to go, they at every quick! The sweet and sour chicken is perfect as it should be. Make great hot and sour soup as well as wonton is great. We usually leave with food for entire family for around 20 and enough for 2 days! Absolutely must try. There lunch dine in meals are also great and real cheap!",2
"I came in around 1am on Saturday night for lounge. Only ordered one drink, a mudslide and it was DELICIOUS. However the lounge vibe felt kinda dead despite it being about 75 full. Everyone was just sitting down without any mingling or activities among each other. So after I finished my drink I seeo point in hanging around and left.",2
"A super collection of very eclectic and unique jewelry, trinkets, glassware, scarves and all sorts. If you're looking for a gift and been through all the usual places and not found anything that lights you up. I thought the beer bottle tumblers were really cool, but I ended up with a set of unusual fridge magnets.",2
im just confused on what the hell this place is trying to be.it looks all cool and modern on the outside.but the menu has low end sandwiches and then high priced steaks? The atmosphere inside is that of a fancy restaurant but it seems like an overdone chili's or applebees. The couscous was decent and their bread pudding is what made me give it the second star since it was made with croissants,1
"In my opinion, Lee Lee's is king of the Valley Oriental markets. That said, LF's is my 1B. LF's has a nice selection of produce, seafood fish, beverages, and everything else you can think of that an Oriental market would offer. The prices I find are competitive, and overall appearance very clean. Competition is a good thing and LF's is a winner.",2
"I only came for the Marzen and Hefeweizen. These are my favorites of this brewer. I remember when the San Francisco location opened in the 90's. Since this is a Palo Alto, CA California Baby born business, I thought I would throw a few pennies their way. I came, I drank, I got a beer buzz and I left.",2
"Kurtis and his team service all of our personal and fleet vehicles. We are extremely pleased with the quality and professionalism he and his staff bring to the table. His prices are competetive, and we are confident we can drive our vehicles up to 200k miles with Kurtis's care and guidance. Thanks Absolute Auto Care! Brandon Cross nMaid Brigade owner operator",2
"This is a nicely remodeled Smith's. You can find anything here. They really redid the deli very nicely with lots of prepared foods. The soups are good. There are also wine tastings. The cheese island, however, is never staffed. The aisles are also very thin and hard to get around. Parking is also hard and the lot is very scary to drive and walk around, because no one can stop in there, lol.",2
I had an awful experience will never be back. Don't make the crepe before you confirm my payment voucher and then reject it then ask me to pay for it. On top of which it wasnt a very good crepe the topping is in a heated container so the fruit is dense and thick. I am so sad I waited for months to have this crepe.,1
I am absolutely in love with the YAO. The food is huge and is the best Chinese I've had in the valley. Great bargain and the folks are most awesome. They do everything they can to make you feel at home and they made me feel like family and they're just being themselves. Just an awesome experience you'll keep coming to over and over again.,2
I have been here about 20 times and never had a bad burger. The buns are always fresh. The meat cooked perfectly and it has a real backyard BBQ style to its presentation. Simple but very effective. The fries are a very large portion so a small fry will probably feed two just FYI. nDefinitely a good choice in the mall for quick lunch.,2
"I went here for the first time for a first date and it was really good sushi and the service was great. However it was really pricey since we both got drinks. While I was there I asked about their happy hour specials. I went back during happy hour and was very satisfied by the food, service and price. My martini was amazing and I suggest the Marilyn Monroll.",2
Update. As of recent the George Street Area is now single lane. They have expanded the outside space for catering and introduced bike only lanes. Finally. nYou'll now find many restaurants and bars have erected catering tents to dine drink in the outside spaces. Parking has been restricted and in all it has become a after more pleasant area for pedestrians and bikers. Big improvement!,2
" Salon review I needed a haircut so I made a last minute appointment with this salon. I was scheduled with Larry, who could not have beeicer. He cut my hair beautifully, I could tell he's a perfectionist, and he carried on a really pleasant conversation with me. I will definitely be returning to this location to see Larry.",2
Ok. Here we go. Bread? Awful. Meats? Horrible. Service? Non existent. WHY ARE THEY ARE STILL IN BUSINESS?!?!?!?! Late night delivery. THAT IS IT. I have ordered from here a ton of times and every time is the same. Late night but disgusting. Last night was the last straw. It is the worst sub shop in Madison. That is all.,1
"Stopped in on a Sunday after having lunch at Wildflower Bread Company. There were no macarons to try, and a limited number of cupcakes displayed, I bought one Vanilla Salted Caramel cupcake. The icing was far too sweet and grainy, and the cupcake itself was dry and crumbly. The Sweet Tooth Fairy does a far better job.",1
"Common Grounds selection seemed very average. The did have some local vegetables for sale, but the fruit came from California, New Zealand, and Chile. We've been here once, but on the next visit to Urbana, we'll try another healthy food store. The staff was very friendly and sociable, so that's good. 2.5 stars, actually.",1
"Shoot me now. I'm actually in the show right now, so unimpressed that I'm going to leave my first ever Yelp review during a live performance. That's bad right? Could be worse, you could always overspend on tickets to this show. If you get tickets comped, say no, unless you are trying to get your kids to fall asleep so you can go gamble some more. Shoulda gone to see Jerry.",1
"This restaurant has horrible service, blah food, with high prices. I ordered the shredded beef tacos which was 13.95, they charged me .99 for flour tortillas and 1.50 for shredded beef which was already on menu? Was going to complain to mgmnt, but was in a super hurry to see a show so I just paid these extra charges. They ruined my nite out . Stay away!",1
"The pan dulce here is so delish. Seriously, the cochitos here are the best I've ever had, so sweet and moist. I love the fact that everything is made fresh daily. I've always received great service and the store looks immaculate even though it's dated. The store is always packed so be prepared to wait a little and the register is cash only.",2
Worse service ever. Left us standing in line. No one acknowledged us again. I have tried to eat in this restaurant before and left because of poor service. My girlfriend walked up to get an ice cream cone because we had waited so long and the girl at the counter turned and walked away four big thumbs down. No wonder the restaurant is half empty.,1
"What a pleasant surprise! I found this place on Groupon couldn't pass up the price. With all the 200 treatments on the Strip, it was refreshing to spend less than 50 for the same treatment. This ended up being of the best massages I've ever had. Excellent deep tissue massage, very professional, relaxing and overall a wonderful experience. Highly recommended.",2
I've been coming here since I was a kid and absolutely love this place. If you have never been just know that the raw food looks like a lot but it cooks down to about half the size so pack the food in. You get to make your own sauce I recommend the chiefs choice thats my favorite and I add some of the spicy thai sauce to give it a little kick its not too hot.,2
"Busy night but still got sat within ten minutes at a nice booth for five. Server was friendly and attentive. All of us ladies enjoyed our food greatly and not one complaint was spoke, that's pretty good with five chics at a table. My chicken was tender and the cheesecake was amazing. Definitely will be back! Best wings with blue cheese I've ever had as an appetizer!",2
"The service here was terrible. How do you screw up an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich? I knew that I was in trouble when the guy asked me if I wanted the bagel toasted. Yes, and please cook the egg and melt the cheese. I award you no stars and may God have mercy on your soul. Yelp won't let me give zero stars. ",1
"Do NOT purchase anything from Big Balls kiosk. What kind of ""business "" won't give you a refund on something you bought 10 minutes ago and realized it will not make the plane ride home?!? It's cheap plastic crap, and they would only do an exchange, even though it's not posted on their crap cart, or the receipt.",1
"For a high end steak house I felt I was eating at a Denny's. Service was sub par. Manager was an idiot. Can't believe Mr. Wynn chose that manager. No wonder you can always get a reservation there. I would not eat there ever again. Lakeside is 1000 even though that number doesn't exist better. Sorry to have to give a Wynn restaurant a poor review, but service is a key element of a restaurant.",1
"I've only been into this location a handful of times. Each time it has been incredibly messy, poorly organized, and unless I am looking for something in particular, I walk through and walk out. Poor quality for what you pay and inconsistent customer service paired with being put on edge with the amount of clutter is enough for me to stay away, no matter how many coupons you try to throw my way.",1
"Not all Taco Bells are the same. I don't know what has changed in the last year or so, but this location is soooo sloooow. Several times I have had to wait 15 minutes in the drive thru after placing my order when there were two cars ahead of me. Today, I ordered a mexican pizza and a potato soft taco and they were both tasting of stale oil. Potatos were dry too. I give up on this location.",1
"Called up Charles to fix a drip irrigation leak, and he was even able to come out the same evening I called. Very professional, efficient, and reasonable. I had tried to do some digging myself, but just enough to keep my Man Card Charles also gave me some tips on landscaping, and answered my questions about various landscaping topics. Most definitely, I would recommend him.",2
"Nope. Sorry, I grew up in pgh. Heart of a true pittsburgher. But my gosh. One word for prantl's crisco. Seriously, my arteries hurt after eating a desert from this place. Not half as good as a few of the French etc bakeries around. Why waste your cardiovascular health on this place go get gelato next door and you'll be better off!",1
"With the addition of AYCE, Krazy Sushi is now a bargain. Price includes apps, soups, salads and a dessert 24 for lunch, 26 for dinner . I have never had any issues with freshness or the taste, although some times the rice falls apart under the Nigiri when the garlic sauce is added. Have been there many times, and the service is superb, we will be back.",2
"Food here is not good. We came here for the teppanyaki but was disappointed. The fried rice was so bland and tasteless. The quality of the seafood and meat is mediocre at best. My hot and sour soup was more sour than anything. Our server was great but the food. No. Sorry, needs a lot of improvement.",1
I am very disappointed in their services. I agree that navigating the phone system is a nightmare.and they don't get back to you.ever. I had a very minor procedure done in the office and they didn't fix it.but they want to keep charging me a copay and also charge my insurance company repeatedly to get it right.,1
"Don't go into Party America if you and those you share your life with won't be OK with you bringing home a rainbow clown wig, neon green St. Patrick's Day hats, plastic Sponge Bob tableware, 1000 Mardi Gras beads, and 10 pounds of assorted hard candies. But if this sounds like your idea of fun, then Party America is the place for you. Maybe I'll see you there.",2
"Best pancakes EVER! Enough said. Can't vouch for anything else though.so you're on your own. Seriously, if you find yourself in Las Vegas with a car or money in your pocket for a 4 mile taxi ride against traffic so it's only about 10 minutes , then make sure to visit BabyStacks Cafe 2. It is well worth the visit and a good break from all the nasty cafe food on the strip!",2
"I read some of the mixed reviews and felt compelled to write a good one because my experience has always been good here. I usually stop by in the morning and the service has always been fast and friendly. I'm usually just getting coffee and working on my laptop, someone always stops by and offers to refill my coffee and it's never super crowded in the morning. So far so good!",2
"They have great beans. But I'm writing this review because I ordered take out and there was some confusion because I pre paid online, but then they gave me a whole burger and fries for free along with my order! That, or they accidentally gave me someone else's order with my food. Whatever. 5 s because I love the beans.",2
"We need to come here more often. I say that each time I go but somehow end up at Gilbert Pizza when the mood strikes. The thing that sets Nincantonis's apart is the fabulous super thin but crispy crust. A pizza is only as good as the gravy sauce and that too excels. I appreciate the sausage is the real deal and not frozen bullets like some pizza joints. Yeah, we need to come here more often.",2
"Lunch at Cibo is a 3 star, however dinner is wonderful Close to a five star . There's not much to say that hasn't already been said. All their ingredients are imported from Italy. Perfect patio for Phoenix winter weather. Parking is horrible, however to have a great restaurant you have to have horrible parking. Definetly top 3 places in the valley to have pizza. Dessert is too die for.",2
"This place has the best carne asada tacos and burritos in town. I order my carne asada without sour cream.and always with fresh cilantro, guacamole and queso blanco. There isn't a messy sauce bar, but delicious verde sauce in squeeze bottles. The food is relatively cheap and the meat is seasoned.unlike at Roberto's. This is amazing food for a cheap price. Check them out if you haven't yet already!",2
"Such a lovely restaurant with peaceful ambiance and well made meals. I had 2 separate meals here breakfast and dinner , and enjoy each thoroughly. Service was superb. The meal was cooked perfectly and the presentation on the plate was outstanding. I would highly recommend the Mandarian Oriental and this restaurant to friends visiting Las Vegas.",2
Worse KFC ever! Drive through takes forever they only do one car at a time a each car takes about 5 6 minutes. Service is horrible. The inside is filthy. And there phone is disconnected so you can call to complain. Today they have someone who has a very strong accent over a horrible speaker so you can't understand anything she says. Don't waste your time as it will take a lot of it if you do.,1
Went in today and had a combo platter with fries and corn. The waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu and the food came out pretty quickly. Everything was really good and the combo platter was a nice way to try a bunch of things all at once. I only made it through about half of it before needing a to go box. I will be back if I'm in the neighborhood.,2
"Always like this Macy's it used to be The Broadway many years ago. It was nice back then and it is still nice now. Lots of parking and there is even covered parking in the garage ,great in the summer months. They carry a nice selection of clothes, jewelry ,cosmetics, and household goods. The customer service is always good. So i really like them and give them a 5 star rating!",2
"I appreciate this hilton location because they made me feel appreciated. The great things about it were nice rooms, nice service, nice ambiance and enviornment. Nice food drink market, nice spa, nice pool jacuzzi bar area, nice perks for listening to their timeshare presentation. A cool alternative to the usual ""vegas hotel "" experience.",2
My husband and I have been clients since moving to Las Vegas in 2004. They are fantastic! They are genuine and care about their clients. I know if we did our own taxes we would never come out as well as we do with their help. They are professional and understand the ever changing tax laws and can explain them perfectly. We will continue to be loyal clients and refer everyone we know to them!,2
"I told my friend that I'd rather eat out of a vending machine, and he said. ""Yelp THAT! "" I had the calamari app, the caprese salad and the eggplant rolotini. The salad was served in what i can only describe as a burnt, upside down bread ""hat "" that was inedible and in the way. The rolotini was a hot pocket, only dry and crappy. Boo on you, Crust!",1
King Cupcakes! Is posting a review on this! This is my specially! Sprinkles cupcakes is very good! The cupcakes here are not to bland or too sweet. A combination between the cake and the icing is quite perfect. This place is highly recommended by King Cupcake among other cupcake restaurants in Arizona.,2
"Just recently had my car washed here. I was very disappointed the car wash was poor, car was water spotted, and still dirty. I went home and tried to wipe down the car to fix water spots, dirt spots etc I was amazed at how much dirt was still on the car andf what a poor job was done. Worst I have ever seen. Really just a waste of time and money.",1
"Foods mediocre, kitchen service is horrible and constantly puts tickets out out of order. Two peoples ticket took 40 minutes. By the time our order was started the other four people at the table who ordered at the same time were done and ready to leave. U have a POS system for a reason, use it rookies.",1
"I absolutely love Dr. Michaels. Sometimes there is a wait but it is well worth it. She is great, answered all my questions and truly offers the best medical attention. I went to Women's Speciality Care for a year a literally came running back once I saw they were on my new insurance. I will NEVER go anywhere else again.",2
"Such a disappointment. My wife and I are huge Beatles fans. We have never seen a cirque show before, so we were thrilled to get the chance. This did not live up to expectation. There were three ""stunts "" that wowed us, but we were expecting a show of that. It was much more of a dance performance than a circus performance, and one without a coherent message or story at that.",1
"My 2nd visit at lunchtime on a weekend Staff is welcoming Food is fantastic. Plenty of seating, tv's, pool tables, and beats every other Grill Bar in at least a 5 mile radius of McClintock and Guadalupe On second thought, not sure that I should yelp this because I don't want it to get so popular I can't get get a seat when football starts Great place so far .",2
"So I was excited to try a new place. I loved the country music but that is about all. After being seated at a very wet table I sat for almost 10 minutes and was never greeted by a waitress. Many walked by me, but no one stopped to say hello. So my husband and I left. Will never be back. Sorry. I love to support my Chandler restaurants, but that was horrible service.",1
"This is one of my favorite ""hole in the wall "" places to eat. The prices are great and the sushi is always fresh. They also have some pretty decent appetizers. nThe Lemon Roll is very refreshing and you really can't go wrong with their lobster roll either. The only roll I haven't liked is the southwest roll and only because it was so spicy I couldn't enjoy it.",2
"I have been visiting Vegas at least every year once since 2000 and have gone to the Pepper every time. Breakfast food is great. Huge, huge portions. I advise a compromise and sharing if u have a partner in crime. Fireside lounge is great. This place to me is the best example of a Vegas diner! n nGreat cheesey interior. Love it!",2
"Not only delicious, affordable food, but an incredibly pleasant staff. Looking forward to their expansions as the only problem right now is the lack of seating. I would avoid it during the peak lunch hours as you will have to wait a decent amount of time. Favorite is the skirt steak sandwich with a side of corn.",2
"I must have ordered the wrong thing here. My hand pull noodles stuck together the same way the Safeway brand noodles I undercook at home stick together. The beef and its sauce was pretty darn tasty, but isn't this place supposed to be all about the noodles? Service was completely rushed and they stared at us while we ate. It was so awkward.",1
"I was a bit confused at first with this restaurant turned night club, but once the drinks started flowing, I became a lot more comfortable with dancing with my friends in front of our booth. Endless supply of mixers and top shelf bottles! Great service, except it is possible one of our waitresses was a bit tipsy at the end of the night.",2
"I'm just not a fan of Fremont Street. As much as it is trying to be revived, and people love it, I feel as though it is just dirty. Fremont street is not my personal cup of tea, and I think I'll pass. I won't bash it because I know some people love it. I'll just say that it is not for me. It just does not feel comfortable to me.",1
"5 stars for catering! I was a little hesitant on getting Pita Jungle for a catered corporate event. They blew it outta the water though, all the platters looked elegant. The staff was absolutely top notch and went above and beyond. Kudos Pita Jungle for having amazing staff! Makes all the difference in coming back. Thank you!",2
"Go to Pio Pio much better choice if you want authentic. While this place isn't bad it's more of Peruvian fast food. The rotisserie chicken is much more tender, juicy and flavorful at Pio Pio. Here it is dry and bland. The sauces are so so. Didn't seem authentic. If you have a choice Pio Pio is much tastier and better value you get a salad in addition to 2 sides.",1
"El stinko grande. There isn't a single thing I would recommend about this place. The ""BBQ "" is lousy, the service is pathetic, and it just isn't worth the effort. The sides are passable, but not at the price. A McDonald's McRib sandwich is better BBQ that what this place puts out. Go anywhere else but here.",1
We hit the drive thru for dessert tonight and I was very disappointed. I ordered a snack size M M McFlurry and a sundae. The McFlurry ended up being vanilla ice cream with M Ms sprinkled on top. Perhaps children don't notice that laziness but I'm no child and mixing the topping in is the entire point. Lame!,1
When I got the bill it was a lot more than I respected because they charged me 3 for a 1 4th of a cup of sub par gravy. She never told me it would be extra and it is just over priced in general. Also the country fried steak was some very poor quality meat. Only good thing about this place was their home fries and decorations. Never going back.,1
"Gosh, we love this place but not at this location. Slow service and terrible food. We nearly missed our flight to bring breakfast on board. The burrito was filled primarily with potatoes. I don't mind spending money at the airport for a good drink and grub, but our 60 dollar tab was a huge disappointment.",1
"I'm not an avid sushi eater, sushi is sushi to me and sushi everywhere seems over priced for what it is. This sushi seemed good and fresh to me, they lost stars due to horrendous and irritating service. Coke products are a big plus, tho they are served in Pepsi cups? I would come back without a doubt, but again, I eat sushi maybe twice a year.",1
"This place is wonderful! I had one of the best reflexology massages I've ever had. Everyone was so kind and made me feel so comfortable. I had a sensitivity to their scented candle and they took them all away! So responsive to my every need. I would recommend them for a wonderful, stress relieving experience. Very affordable as well!",2
"Wow, what a wonderful experience I had yesterday with Dale. I purchased a full body scrub and I was so impressed with the entire experience. The body scrub and massage was by far the best I have ever had. Dale took his time and was so professional. I will definitely go back and try everyone of his services and refer all my friends and family to this sweet man!",2
"If you've never tried Korean food, gotta check this place out. Kimchi jigae is piping hot and delicious. Tofu, pork, kimchi, broth, scallions. yum. Side dishes are nice. Sprouts, kimchi, potatoes. varies by the day. Kpop on rotation on the flatscreen! I spent a few years teaching ESL in Korea and this place always takes me back. check it out!",2
I am very happy with this market. They give great attention to your needs and all the meats are FAR superior to anything you can get at other markets. You do pay a bit more but it is well worth it. I refuse to buy any meat at another place as the quality just isn't there when I buy from Albertson's. You can't find better meat anywhere ,2
"2 stars just because they do have awesome food. The service is horrible, and the staff is very rude even the owners. You are also packed in there like sardines, a very uncomfortable feeling. Prices are high for pizza. Parking is a nightmare if you can even get in. I won't ever return unless they get a bigger place, improve service, and not act like a bunch of snobs.",1
This is the first time I've been here. First of all the Singapore Noodles was the best I have ever tasted in my life and I've had several. The waitress was great. The bus boy literally came around every 5 minutes to make sure everyone had water and he took the dirty dishes away right away. I don't mind saying I may eat here again tomorrow!,2
"This resto is not known for its food or the service. The food is mediocre but you're really paying for dinner to avoid waiting in line when it turns into a supper club. So for the price, you can get better quality food up the street. The resto is spacious and has a nice lounge atmosphere. I love it best for drinks in the summer when all the windows are open and there's a terrasse.",1
I've eaten here twice since being in town. I loved the summer rolls and the Philadelphia rolls. My husband had the spicy California rolls but didn't like them. I would eat here again. I liked the waiters and the atmosphere. The place seemed clean and well maintained. I would recommend this place to others.,2
"My husband will be the first to admit that he is not a foodie. He doesn't get as enthusiastic about planning, cooking, or eating meals as I do. For him to say that the burger we shared here was the best he's ever had is a testament to this place. Outstanding burger, appetizers, even the condiments were phenomenal. And their beer list is GREAT! I can't wait to go back.",2
"Decent hotel. I normally stay at a Hilton. nExcellent service from the staff. nHotel is clean. nBed was comfortable. nShower pressure was good. nNo room service. They have a kitchen, but you have to go there and pick it up. nSaves on the auto gratuity and the high risk of cold food, but OK. nGrounds were very clean. nDid not use their Wi Fi so cannot speak to that.",2
"Stayed here just this past weekend for two nights . The price is decent, i guess for a hotel on the strip. Needs a little renovation. I liked how the security checks your card key before entering the elevator. Make sure you belong and aren't an intruder .Very comfy beds and fluffy pillows. Overall , i liked it .",2
"My family and I go to Sushi in Summerlin on a monthly basis, and they are so good to us here. We order all you can you eat sushi for an amazing price during happy hour like 18.95 , and the minute we sit down, the sushi chef is already bringing us stuff that we order on a regular basis. At the end, they always bring my little sister chocolate desserts, and they are incredibly quick.",2
"I was amazed how much the food sucked at this place. I had the Sicilian w chips looked like Lays chips . I had a much better experience at the OSF in Seattle. You would think the 2 would be the same, right? I give this place 2 stars for having the old Paperboy video game present. but the food. nah. I'd rather go to a Olive Garden or Buca Di Peppo next time unless I'm in the Seattle area again.",1
"Well, believe all the others this is some damn fine southern BBQ. The mac n cheese is baked with nice sharp cheddar scrumptious! Big salads with homemade dressing served as a side. The beer selection is extensive and inclusive to whichever type one would prefer. A good option close to town for casual, moderately priced food. Oh and try the mustard sauce it's yummy. We'll be back.",2
"Visited this afternoon to try out the sushi menu. I wanted to try Tempura Rolls on sale along with California Rolls with Cream Cheese. Chef did not have Cream Cheese, so I went to the grocery store and bought some to place on my California Rolls. Taste was good, sushi was wrapped tight and the price was about 12 20 cheaper than other places in town making for a good value.",2
"Have you ever wanted to have airplane food served to you IN the terminal? Then you've found the right place. Seriously though, this was the worst meal at an airport I've experienced. The service was painfully slow, the food was borderline uneatable, and it was pricey. Wish I'd read the Yelp reviews before entering the shiny exterior!",1
DO NOT HIRE MJ CONSTRUCTION! This GC is not honest. He holds no responsibility for his work and blames everyone and everything around him for HIS mistakes. He will say anything to get your business and bleeds you dry while he takes his time to complete any construction or pass any inspections. He is shady with his employees and sub contractors. DO NOT TRUST THIS GUY.,1
"The service was decent, nothing to write home about. I had their signature chicken sandwich on a pretzel. It came out stone cold. The waitress took it back and reheated it. The roll was stale and it did not taste as good as it sounded. I got a side of brussel sprouts. They were as underwhelming as they were undercooked. My overall impression was ""meh! "" And, I would call that generous.",1
"It is the ""Chipotle "" of Greek food! Portions are very generous. You can choose your protein, veggies and sauces. They have a yogurt based tzatziki and a sour cream based. We had one of each between us, and really liked both. I had the bowl which was an awesome salad. It comes with pita triangles which was just right for lunch. Very kid friendly in here, but no kids menu that I noticed.",2
"I love gay clubs. I had attended this place because a friend got me on the guest list. Well, who knew that me bringing each guest the cover was 20.00. So ridiculous. I have never went to a club with such high cover and no entertainment. I ordered 2 small adios' and they were 26.00 tip. nSo expensive, and really not that classy. They play the same music over and over and over.",1
This place was a lot smaller then I expected and the music was bad. The mix didn't flow and they didn't play any music that's popular. I also found some if the workers running the guestlist to be rude. Not a club I will go back to nor recommend to anyone. The club Eve at the same hotel was WAY more fun!,1
"Great food. Awesome atmosphere. Killer staff. Went in on a weekday around 5ish and was seated promptly and a waitress came right away. Was hoping to get a better happy hour special than I did, but that wasn't the reason I was there. Ordered the lamb shepards pie pasty and was blown away. The little red wine gravy was mind blowing as well. I'll definitely be heading back here more often.",2
"Here at Pizzeria Bianco Truly the best pizza in America experts choice and definitely my choice! Service is amazing and food is truly the best tasting I have ever had. I tried NY Pizza, CA Pizza, Chi Town Pizza and even when we went to Italy where it all began and this spot is truly the best out of all of them! Plus it's in Phoenix! Yeeeeaaaahhhhh!",2
I have the worst and most expensive 10 minutes pedicure here. For 45 the pedicure was not special at all! The pedicure chair was not comfy at all. It doesn't have where the water was bubbling. All you do is soak your feet in a garbage bag. The worker there is not friendly at all especially Nina! She is very loud and rude. I will never come here nor recommend anybody!,1
"I couldn't unlock the trunk of my car, which was a problem because that's where the battery is located and it had died! Reached out to Pop A Lock to solve the problem. Jordan came out the same day a Sunday and io time at all had the trunk open and I was able to replace the battery. Friendly service, knowledgeable and fair price.",2
Place is horrible. Worst customer service ever. Hostess actually told me if I don't like my table I could leave. Wth! I asked if there was another table and she told they were only reserved for platinum members. Really there was no one over there. They need to work on their customer service. My 1st time there and will never go back.,1
This place rocks! nProper old time barber vibe from the decor to the music and even the customers! nI told Neil that I was in town for a rockabilly festival and needed to look the part and he nailed it straight out of the 50's while telling me stories and talking about music. nThen he only wanted 19! It's well worth the 20 minute drive from our hotel. Thanks guys!,2
"The restaurant was amazing. The food was great and the service was very quick. I ate a full slab of 12 ribs and I wasn't very hungry. First time coming here and will definitely add it to the list. Pricing was normal but the server didn't really know much of the pricing. Overall I would recommend it to anyone ! No wait and great food, open late too!",2
"This is a great little place to visit. I love going for runs outdoors and this place is cool to explore. There's lots of vegetation, wildlife and water! Which is a change of scenery in Arizona. Lots of people were fishing but I wouldn't trust what you catch in those ponds. It's a nice place to go for a stroll and explore!",2
"Fun little place out in the middle of nowhere. I don't think I would make a detour for this place in the future. But if you are in the area it isn't to bad. The Onion rings weren't very good. The burgers were pretty tasty and the fries were good. Overall kind of greasy. But again, not a bad spot if you are in the area.",1
"Fine restaurant where the food is delicious, service quick and friendly and location is spot on. Carnitas is always good, especially is a burrito! This place always goes down well with all my friends who visit Edinburgh as everyone can find something they like or something new to try on the menu, depending on how adventurous they're feeling!",2
"In our neighborhood and now our go to local haunt! Great, consistant, friendly staff and talented chefs. Love the specials, love the burgers! Not the least expensive place, but fair priced. Can get loud, but worth every visit. We've probably tried the entire menu with few let downs. Highly recommend.",2
Saturday night out with the whole gang five is not always easy. Decided to try old town. We were greeted by friendly faces and seated promptly despite the place looking full. Our server was all over it. My wife and I were sipping drinks and the kids had their drinks within minutes. Food was great. We left happy with full bellies. Easy dining experience Definitely on the regular rotation.,2
Don't eat the breakfast.utter shit. Wish I had eaten the less healthy McDonald's a few hundred feet away at half the price. The wife and I only at the breakfast here where I'm assuming is not where they excel based on the other reviews. Either that or nobody in the area knows what Mexican food is supposed to taste like. Will not be coming back.,1
"They were quite busy when we arrived and it maintained the entire time we were here. I ordered French toast with a side of bacon. The boyfriend ordered eggs Benedict. Unfortunately most of the food was lukewarm at best, room temperature at worst. The muffin was good tho. Don't think we will be back since there are other places to try.",1
"One lovely morning, I had a wonderful breakfast on the patio here. It was about 30 for two OJs, one coffee, an omelet and pancakes. A little much but the food was wonderful. I always enjoy when the servers let you linger a little on a Saturday morning after you're done eating so you can sip your coffee and enjoy the day.and they definitely did that here.",2
I was walking with my friend checking out the new Palazzo when was stumbled on crowd. Out of curiousity we took a peek and saw 3 women moving to harp music dressed as garden statues. I didn't know what the show was about and what it's trying to show us. I'm thinking an enchanted forest or garden with plants blossoming into beautiful women.,2
"My girlfriend and I came here for dinner on her birthday. This place is really nice inside, food was really good but very pricey. The appetizers were very delicious, sushi was OK considering price for them. I'm not sure if our server was busy or just not in the mood but he was really slow. I would recomment this place for special occassions or groups.",2
"A beautiful restaurant located in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle. Superb food and a nice atmosphere made for an enjoyable evening. Took a bit of a chance with venison in a chocolate sauce, but it really added a nice subtle flavor. The bread pudding was also nicely done even for a traditionalist like myself. The service was very good friendly and attentive. The Witchery is well worth a night out.",2
"this place has great coffee. the food looked delicious, sadly i didn't get to have any. very relaxed and open pretty late for the most part, its just calming and happy in there. definitely great for a first date or just to unwind. love their iced coffee with soy. had a nutty flavor to it, so delicious",2
"Am I the only person who wasn't super impressed with this Bellagio offering? Yeah, the flowers are nice.there are teeny, tiny signs with their scientific names for the wannabe horticulturists. There are some pretty birds, and last August, there was a ferris wheel and a Liberty Bell replica that were, you know, nice. But really, an indoor garden is a MUST SEE Vegas location? I think not.",1
"I know this is supposed to be mentioned later but the food was excellent. I had the shrimp and grits plate and my wife had a airline chicken plate. This is on their March 2014 menu. Service from the host stand to the server to management touching our table mid meal, to being thanked on the way out was extraordinary. The price per portion was equal. We will definitely go again.",2
"They draw quite a crowd for a pay for view event, but they do not have the capacity to serve this size of crowd. Required to spend a specified amount on food, but waited over 1 hour to place order. Then waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for food to come. Gratuity automatically added to bill, despite lack of service!",1
"I just moved back to AZ from LA and I've been dying for some GOOD pho. There are not many places here like there are in LA and when I found this place I was super excited because it was nice, not dingy, and looked clean and well kept. I got chicken pho and it was very fresh and delicious! I can't wait to show my boyfriend my new find he loves pho too! I will be back soon!",2
"Pretty good selection of clothes here. They have a better women's collection of clothes I believe. I prefer TJ Maxx for guys clothes. The lady at the register was very rude to a lady in front of me and it bothered me. I understand you work at Ross and hate your life, but chill out at least you have a job.",1
"Stayed here this past Saturday night for a Steelers game. I was fearing the worst from the reviews, maybe setting low expectations improved the experience. The hotel was great. Clean, comfortable, decent price, friendly people, free shuttle to and from the game, and quiet at night. No complaints, i'd stay here again if I was in town for a Steelers game.",2
"The atmosphere is to DIE for, and the crepes are the best I've had outside of France. The pasta dishes are exquisite, and the wine is even better. The servers are very knowledgeable. My server was fantastic, and had a great palette. He even creates and distributes his own line of wines. The freshly grown ingredients really made a difference.",2
I'm so tired of being stereotyped here. Don't ask me if i know wtf ph u00f3 is or if I know what's in it? Especially if I can pronounce what I'm ordering. Do honestly believe I would eat here alone if it where my first visit? I like the food here but my last few visits have been less than pleasant with the staff. It's time to find somewhere else.,1
Back to ferraros thursday late night and this time we enjoy some pappardelle mimmo and pollo parmigiana. we love tha ambiance at the late night and specially service and music. and we love to meet with friends after work. we really love the selection of wines by the glass and the service. a touch of italy. see you soon!,2
"I'm newly obsessed with this place. I love the fresh fruit cups with ice cream and the shaved ice was tremendous. They have so many flavors it's unbelievable as well as an extensive sugar free selection which is nice. The shaved ice are huge but super delicious. The prices were very fair and the staff was wonderful. I will for sure become a regular here, it's too good to pass up a frozen treat.",2
Came in here late after the bar ordered some breakfast and some hamburgers because you can get them both at this location it took us 45 minute wait before we got it it was crazy ridiculous. Called the corporate office they said they would take care of the problem Scott in a little bit better but not hundred percent.,1
"We had a great experience here! Fantastic service, absolutely delicious vanilla drip coffee, delicious bread, yummy omelettes! My daughter got a burger gluten free style with no bun and it was cheesy, juicy and delicious! Delicious milk shakes too! Big time yummy there! We will absolutely go back. Today was our first visit and we enjoyed every minute!",2
"Awsome spot in st Henri. nRight Next to the m u00e9tro st Henri. nWonderful terrasse for sunday morning breakfast brunch. nSweet house donuts and brioches With its jams homemaded too . Excellent ! I am really a fan of jams ! Salty dishes offered for brunches too 15 20 Worth it, very original Inside restaurant deco is amazing! Private room downstairs for group or d u00e9gustation.",2
"Best flavors and choices! So yum, yum, yummy. I think I had island coconut, pink lemonade, cherry amaretto, banana pudding, orange pineapple, and more all in my little cup. I love it! nThe only bad thing.I have to drive a half hour away to satisfy my cravings. nSo, I am still on the hunt for something closer and similar, but at this point Yumberri is my favorite frozen yogurt shop!",2
"Wow this place is great for kids of all ages. For the little one's there's giant foam block and play kitchen for the old ones they have a gigantic light bright, glow in the dark room and so many art projects. Cost is 7 per person even for the parents. Bring a picnic they have a wonderful area to eat.",2
"A very poorly run youth hostel. The staff is unprofessional, the rooms are small and poorly designed. The bathroom is shared with 5 rooms. The breakfast is just continental, nothing substantial. I have never been so glad to leave a hotel or B B. I go to Montreal often and would never stay there again.",1
"We just had the fried chicken , greens, cabbage , mac cheese, mashed potatoes corn muffins. Everything was very good the people were great it is real home cooking , small business it's best they are happy to have you you can tell it. Tried to come yesterday but they are closed tuesdays 10 min off strip again you get great value quality we will be back",2
"Excellent steak, great prices, and best of all, a classic vegas expierence. Love this place, have been several times and will continue to go back. I had the filet last night, it was delish! but my husband had the rib eye, and i am thinking next time i am going to go that route! it was really good over the wood fire!",2
"First timer here at the Boiling Crab and boy was I satisfied! Food was great but a little pricy. Service was fast and on it! My family and I were thinking it was going to be a small portion but boy was I wrong. 1 lobster, 1 dungeness crab and 2 lbs of shrimp was enough for us. I will be definitely coming back here. 5 stars!",2
"As you can see, this place has gone downhill. The service was never great, but my last experience tells me that it's worse and the food is not that great. If you live in Vegas. then this is an OK option. If you're used to good Soondoobu in other cities like LA and the Bay area, then you'll be disappointed. Side dishes are weak here and they never come back to refill anymore.",1
"I like this place a lot. The wait can get obnoxious since it's fairly small, but the excellent beer selection at the bar makes it worthwhile. The food is great. I loooove the sweet potato fries. The one thing I could do without is the live music. The space is way too small to be able to hold a conversation over some crappy jam band.",2
Best restaurant in Waterloo! nI've been in Waterloo for 4 years and have never been till now. They have really good fusion dishes as well as special entrees such as deer and ahi tuna. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody. PS. The menu might make the food seem very cultural but its actually light so its easy to adapt.,2
"Prices seem to be a little high for the work they're doing. The biggest issue though is definitely the customer service, or lack thereof. Tall man in glasses working the counter has been short and rude with every single customer I've witnessed including myself. Too bad I didn't have much time and just wanted the battery replaced. Won't ever be spending another penny inside this place again.",1
"Sapphire Cool strip club, not as club feeling as seemless, it feels more like a huge restaurant with no food, and girls walkin around. LOL. I heard the champagne room was really cool. Cost a couple g's to get up there but F that! I'd rather play it on a table! Hahah did get bottle service here and got really drunk. They say this is the biggest strip club in the world.",2
First time here and will tell u we sat there for 20 min and didn't even have anyone approach us for a drink order! Everyone that came in after us had service and drinks right away! First and last time we will ever go there! Guess there was a reason we were avoiding that crappy service establishment!,1
"Tart tasty! Clean, well kept toppings bar and quite a selection of flavors. I really liked this fro yo shop and I am pretty particular with my fro yo. Did I mention they carry yogurt chips which is one of my requirements when giving a nod to greatness in the fro yo market. You gotta give them a try.",2
"We love this place. Inexpensive. Huge portions the husband and I usually share a main course and rice . Fresh, very tasty food. Great service. nI've decided to up this from 4 to 5 stars. It's not the BEST or fanciest Chinese restaurant in the world ever, but it IS the best Chinese food for the price and convenience. It beats the local competition hands down.",2
"I'm not a huge walmart fan as it goes but I have found this store to be in consistently good condition, very clean and well stocked. However I recently had a very poor experience with their customer service department and I was extremely disappointed in how rude and short they were with me. This experience left such a negative impression on me, I do not think I will be back.",1
"The best food I've had in Las Vegas. One of the specials was a mushroom pasta with wild boar sauce I was curious to try this, as well as the chicken vesuvio, so the waiter encouraged our party to split a few dishes. Everything was excellent and not one person was left disappointed. nThey make all their pasta fresh everyday, and the service alone is enough to go back for.",2
Nothing special. They had a special for 3 old fashions which was a good deal. The food was kind of bland. I ordered the ahi tuna tacos and there was a lot of cabbage. The wasabi sauce was decent. Probably will not be going back here much. The mussels were decent at best. The best thing might have been the little cornbread muffins and honey butter they bring out pre meal.,1
"Can't figure out why this place is reviewed so low? Awesome place! We ordered club sandwiches with pop. Best sandwich we've had in awhile. Brought our dog, Duke, and sat out on the misty patio! Service was great and was asked if we wanted dessert so we got chocolate ice cream! We will return! make sure to check out all the pictures on the wall. Our pic is the cutest one by far!",2
"One of the best restaurants, hands down. The food was just amazing. The live entertainment was great too! I really want to knock off a star because the server spilt a cocktail on me, but really can't knock a star because the food is divine. Also, the hostess was so awesome, she gave us a tour of all the rooms, I really enjoyed her company.",2
"sandwich place that does not know how to make a sandwich. Lets say a place that sells slices of pie, lets call it ""pie pie "" If they were anything like Which Wich you would order a slice of apple pie and the waiter would say all am going to bring you is an apple unless you tell me how to make an apple pie. Terrible!",1
"Well I'm a fan of curry and decided to try there's red curry of coarse, wen I got. Back to work with my food I wasn't happy that there was so much vegetables and barley any chicken. Also I order a side of noodles and they gave me steamed noodles I wanted the flavored noodles, the counter lady barley understood me and had no knowledge of English, the atmosphere is dull and lifeless",1
Rox was a great instructor and she was willing to guide us individually whenever needed. The brushes were like new and not overly used like I have had at other painting venues. We had a group of 8 and we all had a great time and painted better than we ever thought we could. I would recommend Vino and Canvas to any group or individual that wants to get out and find their inner Picasso. Lots of fun!,2
"Hands down one of the best in town. Awesome food, service and ambiance. Our server was knowledgable about the menu and gave great recommendations for wine selections. If he didn't know something he brought somebody over that did. The apps were amazing and so was the ribeye. Great whiskey list too. Will be coming back very soon",2
"Met the girls for lunch Tuesday, some of us got sick. nMost everything is fried, no healthy choices. nWay overpriced, for what is is. I had fried shrimp with dirty rice. nThe rice was really undercooked and there was something off with the shrimp. nMy friend had the shrimp and lobster salad, She ended up really sick. nI say Papa Don't.",1
"I have been here for lunch a few times, but recently my wife I went here for dinner. Have to say the service and food were very good. Both of us really enjoyed ourselves. Even though we didn't step up to the 3 pepper "" meals, our food was plenty spicy. Huge menu and great looking deserts too. Give it try, you won't be disappointed.",2
I probably liked this place more than I should since we got in free for being a Mandalay Bay guest. The view was extraordinary and the drinks weren't over the top expensive. I realized that Belvedere is my favorite vodka.and SKYY Vodka is the well at every place in Vegas. The music really wasn't bad either. And I didn't feel like anybody's mother.which was AWESOME!,2
If it wasn't for yelp i would never knew that there is a Gurudwara Sahib in Las Vegas area. Beautiful Building and open to all regardless of gender and race. i uploaded few pictures i hope you guys like them. This place is 20 25 minutes away from Las Vegas Strip. There is another Sikh Temple which is very close to the Las Vegas airport.,2
"Came here for lunch yesterday and I really enjoyed everything I thought all the flavors were a solid ""Good! "" were they amazing? No. but it was good. We ordered a variety of plates ranging from dim sums like sesame sweet dumplings, crab claw, shu mai, and beef noodles. Service was efficient and drinks were delicious. 2 thumbs up!",2
"Cowboy Ciao will serve you a nice plate of food but will fail to excite. I could serve these plates out of my own kitchen. For example, braised short rib, red quinoa, steamed bok choy and a side of dipping sauce. Pictures all these components separated on the plate as opposed to being plated on top of each other in any way. Take your money elsewhere.",1
"the food isnt bad at all. nthe reason im reviewing though is for the banana split. OMG. ndefinately one of the best i have ever had. and definately worth the 8.95. if youre around that part of town and just need a quick desert or meal, stay away from the pricey food courts and restaurants in the big casinos. peppermill is definately worth it.",2
"This buffet has got to be the most disgusting place in Las Vegas. The restrooms were nasty, the food was cold, the food was mis labeled. The Asian workers didnt seem to care when I told them that food was cold. I will never visit this nasty buffet again unless I hear that they have cleaned it up and improved the temperature of the food. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE",1
"The Panachos nachos fries where both cold and old. Ti bad, it would have been pretty good. The Sonora Hotdog was good thought. nThe wait was almost 20 minutes, with NO line. The cooks in the back must not be on the ball, oh thats right, he came out from ti have a coke and a chat. nWe will by pass this place nwxt time.",1
The guys here are absolutely amazing at being honest about pricing and labor along with completely backing there work. I have always brought my car here originally via referral from a good friend and they have always done an amazing job. Also everyone i have referred to them has had the same great experience that i have had.,2
"First time at a Rally's, last time at a Rally's. Their fries were good but the honey mustard sause was a weird gelatin consistency. I asked for another one at too looked like brown jello. The ""chicken "" strip were paper thin oddly flavored strips. The big chicken sandwich should be called the big mayonnaise sandwich. Fries aren't worth coming back.",1
"Love this place. Only ever eaten breakfast here, but the atmosphere is great the owners are very nice and the staff is efficient but caring. The food is GREAT. The breakfast items are REALLY fresh and makes me think they get them locally. I saw a lot of ""organic "" on the menu, so I know the actual ingredients are very good. Highly recommend this place!",2
"I don't like giving bad reviews but this place earned it. I wish I took heed to warning from all the other reviews. This place doesn't care about there clients, they tampered with my food and I ended up with food poisoning accommodated with stomach muscle spasms immediately after eating there last night.",1
"Have again the Philly sandwich was actually not bad because the bun was delicious and the meat onions was good. nNot have again the bacon cheese fries were marred because of the cheese, which of course is not really cheese. Service was not very good since I had to remind them that they still needed to give me the fries twice.",1
"I got the ""Express Wash "". Only 5, yay! It was done really fast. So I was really happy about that! The only thing that is preventing me from giving 5 stars is that they did a shoddy job drying my car. I inspected it and had them dry it again. They're explanation was that ""it's only an express car wash it's not suppose to be perfect "". They dried it again and everything was good to go!",2
"This busy bakery has several different pastries, desserts, ice cream, and coffee. We tried the red velvet cupcake and a large chocolate chip cookie. The cupcake was large and moist with delicious tangy cream cheese frosting. The cookie wasn't too hard or too soft, and the chocolate was rich and plentiful. I would definitely stop in again to try their other desserts.",2
First time here. Really like the open and fresh feel of the place! Yummy Bellini to be had! Had eggs Benedict with jalape u00f1o English muffin and hubby had chicken fried steak. Super tasty! Server was really knowledgeable about all the items on the me u and was able to give great recommendations base in my vague explanation if wants. I would totally recommend this place.,2
"I would like to thank who ever is responsible for planting the beautiful plants at the Look Out Area at Charlotte Douglas Airport. My husband and I are avid plane watches ,being surrounded with pretty things makes the day special. nThe South Western Plane and the new merged US AIR American Air are best in show.",2
Been sometime since we stopped here. Didn't care much for it then was disappointed again. Ordered simple takeout spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs tasted like meat mushed together and didn't even taste like meat. Even more disappointing getting home and wondering where the heck was the meat sauce! Come on guys you think for that price you can place more than a scoop of sauce on the pasta.,1
Tim! You are awesome! Your crew was amazing! Being from a military family we go through a lot of moves. We've seen the best and the worst. Master Mover by far has been the best movers we've ever experienced. No hidden charges! They take care of your furniture and your home! The crew is very professional. Thanks guys! GO ARMY!,2
I understand most people like strong drinks but I like my drinks normal and I had to return my martini and get wine. It tasted like robitussin and rubbing alcohol. I've bad a better steak at outback and it only fake with. Literally. Four potatoes. The bruschetta tastes like I'm drinking olive juice. well. It just wasn't my favorite place.,1
"Sat on the dining side and while we were seated promptly to a dirty table that we ha to stand there while she cleaned it was all downhill from there. Appetizer was undercooked. Drink tasted like straight NyQuil, which I didn't get until reminding her I ordered a drink, and filet mignon was brought to our table COLD. Will not be back.",1
Service was excellent waitress was very friendly my wife and I both ordered the filet mignon which was perfectly cooked we sat outside so you could not ask for a better view definitely worth the money in fact kind of inexpensive considering the quality of the food and the fact that it's directly across the street from the fountains at Bellagio,2
I am writing this litterally as I eat a piece of their pie. I caot get why people find thing place so good for pie. The chocolate Satin is a little salty and the crust breaks a little too easily for my taste. But you cant expect much I guess since they do not make pies in house. nStick with small bakeries .,1
If I could give this place a lower rating I would. The security guards were so rude. I'm never going back. My bachelorette party left feeling like it was a waste of time to even step into this club. We were planning on spending the entire day at this pool and drinking the day away. Instead we left after we had our two free drinks and left unhappy. This was truly an awful experience.,1
"I love it cause its so close to the house and the food was really good. But the person taking the order did not make eye contact with me once. The food took longer thaormal. And when I received my order, I kindly said, ""thanks. have a good day. "" He ignored it and said next in line. No bueno. First impressions are big when eating at a spot.",1
"An upscale lingerie shop. High class european under garments. Take a step beyond the secrets and Hollywood into the boudoir of France. Italian stockings and leg garters are the only things that should be on a ladies legs or mans if your into that. Prices are definitely not what you are used to, but they are what you would expect to pay for real garbs. Not costume. Treat that lovely lady right!",2
The frozen yogurt here tastes artificial and its always packed with kids. The sample cups are inconveniently located in the back so you have to go against traffic to get them. Annoying. I only come here when I have a desperate craving for frozen yogurt because its the only yogurt shop in my neighborhood. I have been to all kinds of frozen yogurt shops and imo Yogurtland is the best.,1
Wow. The slowest fast food ever. Waited 40 minutes for food.When we get to the window she hands me our ice cream and we wait at the window for like 12 more minutes as the Ice cream is melting. Total wait for 2 burgers and fires and ice cream 45 minutes. Ice cream is totaLLY melted. Not sure how long it sat before we got to window. And price is ridiculous for OK burgers.,1
"Last chance is a great store if you love bargains. I went here last summer and got lots of great outfits. Some things didn't fit but its okay. This store is huge with shoes, clothes, etc. The only downfall was how the dressing room was open. No privacy. But it's a great place to shop if you love cheap designer things.",2
Great bar with a very classy feel. Won't find an immature crowd here. Intimate feel with great martinis and cocktails. Also a few good tap beers. Employees are knowledgeable and have a neat appearance with black shirts and red ties. There is also a good variety of music that's not so loud that you can't have a good conversation. Capitol Bar esque feel but on state street.,2
"Are you guys serious? My meal at Rose Tea Cafe was the saltiest thing I've ever had, and I've eaten a big heaping bowl of salt. Greasy, too. I felt sick after eating here. My bubble tea nearly gave me a headache from all the sugar, and I usually love sweet things. Maybe this is authentic, but it isn't good.",1
Oh snap you have try this little joint! They have such a great and well executed menu that it had me saying oh my lord good food like this is just pure bliss. From beginning to end I was treated to such a great and flavorful dishes that were carefully crafted and made to delight our palettes. Make sure to give this wonderful place a good try and don't skip on desert they are to die for. NJOY D,2
"The donuts are really good, 79 cents for a donut and a 1.29 for the bigger one. Nice soft, and good size. Right near my work. I will admit there is another bakery that I do love that ha s donuts and other breads there service is better.but the lady who served me today was nice at the end. I will come back especially since this one is closer.",2
"I am a patient of Dr. Andersen and he is amazing! Had surgery on my foot and the scar is barely noticeable he answers any all questions I have and is not rushing out of the room. Office staff is always super helpful, professional, and polite. Very friendly and understanding. I would highly recommend this practice to anyone ieed of podiatry work.",2
"I tagged along with my girlfriend for her eye check up and was blown away by the service. The office manager waited on us. She was knowledgeable, professional, and efficient. She even sold me a pair of T Charge sunglasses that are perfect. I was so impressed I decided to change optometrists and have a check up scheduled for tomorrow.",2
"Malaya Kitchen is exactly what the Arboretum needs, a restaurant that isn't vanilla. I saw the ad in creative loafing and it spoke to me. So I wanted to go check it out. A modern restaurant, the portions are generous, 8 lunch specials. The waiters are all friendly and helpful. A great little find to get your Asian on.",2
"Very long wait. Food never came. Manager on shift on June 22, 2913 around 11 pm, said he lost our order. We asked for a refund and didn't even comp our water or say sorry. He blamed us for the whole ordeal. The manager that night wasn't wearing a name badge and wouldn't give me his name. The customer service royally sucks. ZERO STARS.",1
"Great food and great service. The place is so much nicer on the inside than it seems when you see it from the street. Every time I go there I leave happy. Their Thai ice cream is amazing. One caution, the food can be very Spicey so if you are not sure what level of spice to choose go at least one level lower.",2
It started off promising. BBQ smell was amazing and had my mouth watering. Got some wings as an appetizer. They came out fast but were really bland and lack that BBQ flavor I was craving. Next I waited for my brisket. and waited. and waited. An hour and a half later I got my food and it was flavorless. They wouldn't even comp my appetizer for the wait. I will NEVER eat here again. Such a shame,1
Wow! I won't be going here. I called to ask a simple question about whether they carry an item and was treated like I was stupid because I don't know the details of their business or what kind of inventory they carry. If this is how they treat their potential customers on the phone I'm afraid I won't be one of them.,1
"I've been here twice for brunch and am in love! I had the ricotta lemon pancakes which were heavenly, light and delicious! they come covered in a blueberry coulis and come with a side of thickly cut smeared in maple bacon. It's delicious! All the menu items are very well thought out, and the staff is very friendly. You can tell that the people here love what they do and their food shows it!",2
"I got one of the crepes here and was somewhat disappointed. Well the fruit in the feeling was fresh and Nutella is always good, the pancake itself was too thick and tough. I can't see myself spending 7 or 8 on another one of these PS they are very large so I recommend splitting it with someone if you choose to spend your money.",1
"We ate there yesterday and first, the guy at the bar was rude. We didn't tip him at all! For what? We were seated at the table and the appetizers were brought to the table, they were good. Well the chickeuggets, the fries and the sliders taste like crap! Don't go there to eat, staff not great, not accommodating. Too pricey! Don't bother eating there.",1
"One star for nGreat tasking House Margarita, however expensive 10.50 and small maybe 5 oz. . nPatio seating on the roof was great for fall. But nMy ""Vegetarian Chile Relleno "" was stuffed with chicken. nOur waitress didn't bring a drink to my kid after he asked for water. nSlow service on the roof. nFood is overpriced by about 20 . I know it's Carefree, but it's silly. ",1
"I would rather throw my money into a fire fit than spend it here. They don't know how to cook steaks, the food has no flavor, and their ""crab "" tasted like it was frozen and in a can. There was a group of 10 of us and we unanimously agreed this place was one of the worst steakhouses we'd been to. I've had better steak at Norm's for a fourth of the price.",1
"Why eat here when you can go to Luisas? Because it is Sunday, that is why and Luisas isnt open for lunch. Place is run by a gaggle of freaks with face tatts and all kinda disorders. That doesn't bother me. Just save the attitude for the rest of the Yung Jeezy Crue, OK? OK pizza when Luisas is closed.",1
The family saw the show and was pleased. The kids really had a fun time they were laughing and were amazed. The opening act was hilarious! We also got a little glimpse of an up close magician do several card tricks. For the amount of money we paid it was worth the price. They have additional deals if you see other shows and or buy the DVD and picture.,2
Breakfast is good. Salad's are a mix of greens and romaine I detest an iceberg salad and the tea and coffee is fresh. They definitely make the cold salads fresh daily because when we visited our only option was macaroni salad because they had been busier than usual and hadn't had time to make anything else. I'm good with that as I prefer fresh foods over instant gratification.,2
"Cindy seems stuck in her past to me! Too bad. I loved their shop, but just don't need the baggage of people who need to needle people over the effects of their former profession. Get over it! We all have to be professional and personal gossip never flys. Always a hazard in a salon, but who would have thought dogs would ever talk!",1
"This place is just super disorganized. Everytime I come through here they always mess up an order. I don't usually come here at all, but sometimes I have to for school meetups or what not, and everytime I do, something is always wrong. They forgot to put egg in my egg and cheese breakfast sandwhich. They need to go out of business or hire better people.",1
"Oh gracious, I could not love the tacos here anymore than I do. They are double the size you'd expect, and are filled with yummy goodness. I had heard about Costa Vida for so long without trying it, and why o' why did I wait! The cheese quesadillas are something I get cravings for, and they are just too good to not order on a regular basis. Go, don't wait, go.go now. Right now.",2
"My burrito was given to someone else and I caught the mistake. Then our chips were not cooked so we asked for done ones and the manager comes back with a smart alec answer telling his cooks we want them extra crispy. No buddy, we just don't want them raw! The drive to Stephanie is world it. When you get the right food though it is very good.",1
"My main riff with this place is that it is IMPOSSIBLE find a cocktail waitress. We would have been better off using the water fountain waiting on them. Other than that, its an ok place, alot of older people there but nice. Rampart, we spend a lil more when we've had a few drinks, you guys know that though. o ",1
"One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. I can say this is THE BEST PERSIAN food you can find around here. In fact, Im ready to go out on a limb and declare, its the best Persian food Ive had! My favorites are the beef kubedeh and barg. Their bread is baked fresh and is devine as well. Dont forget to try their ice cream",2
"This place is awful. Drinks are way overpriced and weaker than a popcorn fart. The place is filthy inside and smells like a old, sweaty jock strap. Staff is slower than molasses and you'd see the Minnesota Vikings in the Super Bowl before you get served. Always a testicle festival. No hot single chicks here. Rather buy a 12 pack of Ultra and spend my Friday night under a bridge. Go Packers!",1
Service is great! This is a family owned business and are very friendly and helpful if you don't know some items on the menu. Pho is great. Even better for left overs. Sushi is super fresh and delish. Been here 4 times and I try something new each time. I love it. The atmosphere is very nice as well. It's pretty. They also have a very nice bar.,2
"Come late at night early morning when you can meet the coolest bartender Justin, and happen to come across an old timer named John.Justin is informative of the menu, makes you feel at home, and just nice as hell! The food is super good we had the fish minus the chips and a ""Boli "".YUM! But look for John, he has a story or two! Seriously going back just to see these two guys!",2
My husband and I loved this place. The staff was very helpful with ordering and allowed us to sample six of their most popular items. We had enough food for leftovers the next day for under 25. It was great to see everything from ties to tatoos having a good time. My only complaint is that the restaurant could be a little cleaner.,2
"Bought a suit online from one of my favorite vendors. Knew I needed to get it tailored locally, but didn't know where to go. Asked some friends and Myers Park Tailors was recommended over and over. Walid nailed the exact fit I was looking for at a lower price then I expected to pay. Great work and customer service. I'll be back.",2
This place is a must I make a point to eat here every time I go to Las Vegas. The food is amazing minus the pork chops and they give you really big portions . Allison was my waitress twice during my last las Vegas trip and she was amazing . If you go I recommend the biscuits and gravy or the Philly cheesesteak omelet .,2
"I just had the Bobbie, billed as the best sandwich in America. The medium version was everything i expected, stuffed full of homemade turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo. The service was super fast and the girl working at the counter was super cute. All in all, Capriotti's was awesome and i'll definitely go back later this week before I leave Vegas.",2
"Friendly and informative front desk staff, beautiful waiting space in the entryway, need a few details looked after like their too dark elevators, but their conference washrooms were clean and the Jackie Robinson room was absolutely beautiful whether it be for a conference meeting or small wedding reception. Gorgeous view and window fixtures make it perfect for any time of day.",2
"It seems like some people in North Scottsdale have low standards? The place is overly crowded I cannot understand why it's not that great. I ended up getting sick after eating here, not just me but my boyfriend too. Oh well, I gave it a try several times only because the location, I will make the drive to find something else.",1
"It's Jimmy Johns. Get in, get your sandwiches freaky fast, don't forget to order a pickle, look at the cool signs, eat it, and then beat it. The staff at this location knows how to smile and is friendly.and the food is consistently good. And the fountain drinks are mixed properly and don't suck. What more do you need?",2
"The quality of ingredients used in their excellent galettes is admirable. My Savoyarde was stuffed with lardons, ratte potatoes and oozy raclette, and a companion's shredded duck and roast onions was full of savour my thesaurus is overheating . Add nice service, gentle pricing and a funky interior and Spanel is an unqualified success.",2
"Tried it a few times. Hardly a warm welcome from the young girl up front. Thought I'd give it another chance since I love how close it is it my home, only to find out that when they say they are open at 7am, it's a tentative 7am. I didn't want to drive around looking for another dry cleaner so like an idiot I waited till 7 30 and still no one. Needless to say, it's time for a new dry cleaner.",1
"This is the first time I used Bobbies, but it won't the last. I wanted to send my wife flowers for our anniversary. WOW! they did a fantastic job. We were both blown away by the beauty and the size of the arrangement, I wish I could upload a picture, words cannot describe how beautiful it was. nThank you",2
"Waited 45 minutes for a salad? Our server didn't check on us and we had little ones with us. The kitchen was backed up. It is a restaurant right, it's what you do? nToo bad, we have given this place a chance and every time the service is lacking. Go when you have plenty of time and aren't hungry, it takes a long time to get your food.",1
"I'm a local and really wanted to like this place! However, the food besides the cod is not very good. The boneless buffalo wings taste like they were nuked out of a frozen bag. Yucky quesadilla. Bland salsa at least the beer is cheap. But I usually go to the dutchmans hide out if I want something that actually tastes good!",1
"Horrible service. My gf and I brought our cars there. She paid 25 and they did a horrible job on the interior and my car they refused to wash bc the rear window was missing on my convertible, it melted off bc of the heat .I brought it down the street and Danny's car wash washed it by hand without a problem.",1
"Service was super disappointing. Our waitress simply lacked any hustle. We were greeted for the first time 5 10 mins after we were seated. She served a warm bottle of white wine, and simply missed submitting several food drink orders. She seemed busy hanging out with her friends. There are several other competing establishments in the area that I'd recommend over this place.",1
"I would say this is one of the best Vegetarian Vegan restaurants I have been to in a while! Their mock meats are seasoned so well and the food is really healthy you feel good leaving there! Appetizer Chili Fries.Yum! Entree Kung Pao Chicken.Yummier! Dessert Tsoynami with bananas, peanut butter, mallow.Yummiest! So good you must go!",2
"I loved a lot of the styles.but the prices, my goodness! n 48 for a polyester blend cardigan?.You'd have to be born yesterday. nAside from clothes they also have a lot of useless kitsch you could get for your friends as gifts if you have no idea what to get them. You gotta REALLY look to find a deal. Probably never going there again. p nThe atmosphere feels kind of.douchey in there.",1
"The completion of the new shops and waiting area in terminal 1 has defintely elevated McCarran from the ho hum airport it had been to a functional, modern, transportation hub. The facility is clean, efficient, and well organized. I was able to move from ticketing counter to gate in less than 15 minutes the last time I passed through.",2
"There was a lot of hype coming into this place for me. Their pizzas are brick oven and have a flaky crust. I enjoyed a beet salad for the first time and was also very impressed. The best thing I had was the arugula wrapped in prosciutto. I definitely would get that again. Overall a great experience, however nobody will have my experience because I had a smoking hot date ",2
"Had sushi here 2 times and it tasted alright for the most part, though the fish tasted a bit ""fishy "" not very fresh, and the ginger had a weird forresty taste or as if it had fermented for a while. BOTH times I got bad stomach aches and got the squirts! THE FOOD HERE IS NOT FRESH IT WILL MAKE YOU SICK!",1
"I recently bought a Groupon coupon for half off of a meal delivery service called Mama Mimi. I just redeemed the coupon this week and I am really impressed. I ordered a home made lasagna and some seafood linguini and both were divine. And the lemon loaf for dessert was really great too. All in all, I will totally order from Mama Mimi again as it gives me a couple of nights off from cooking ",2
"Ja nun was soll ich sagen. Die Steakts TOP 1a, First Class, daf u00fcr 4 Punkte aber das Ambiente h u00e4tte dringend mal eine renovierung oder Aufwertung notwendig. Ich bin ja ein begeisterter Steakesser aber ich finde das Lokal mittlwrweile langweilig das ist hier nur ein Punkt wert geht es anderen ebenso?",2
YUM. My first time here! I loved it. I got the French scrambled eggs with sausage and baguette. Everything was GOOD! The green ice tea was good and better cold. The ice machine was out of ice. It took them about 15 to 20 mins to get more ice into the machine. The chocolate croissant was super good. Got 4 macaroons and I inhaled them at home. YUM.,2
"Place is clean, looks new, server Liz was great and food was really good had a grand slam. Asked for the bacon to be really Krispy and I didn't have to send it back. Just for that I'm impressed, my gf asked for black coffee and the server didnt ask ""cream ""? So obviously they hire people with some form of intelligence.",2
My wife and like to go here from time to time. We enjoy sitting out on the patio by the rail and people watch and drink a couple of beers. My wife loves the shrimp cocktail and orders it everytme we go. Along with chips and salsa. Had fish tacos a couple of times and it was good. The staff is always freindly and give great service everytime we go.,2
"We had great burgers on Friday, 11 23 12. My husband had cheeseburger.traditional style. I had a Sicilian no wheat for me, I am gluten free. The burger was served in their spectacular style with a small head of lettuce cut in half which served as a bun. Also, their serving of french fries was very generous for husband and I loved their version of coleslaw.",2
"Alright so classy I know, but we had the corn dog puppies and lobster roll. Both were really good. Drinks were good. Decent happy hour deals also The bartenders were great. I really enjoyed the music though.I heard Korn, Alice in Chains, and Metallica while I say at the bar. There aren't many places that I've been to where I could say that. .made me want to stay longer",2
"This branch is so slow, especially around 10 am to 2 pm. Always seems to have 10 employees but only 3 windows open. Random employees walking around saying ""thanks for coming in today "" ""how's your day going "". My day was going well until I came in. I recommend using the atm for every possible thing that the atm dose, instead of going inside.",1
"Ehh. Ordered the house special noodles with beef, chicken and shrimp. Also ordered an order of spring rolls and a watermelon boba. They are a bit expensive and also my noodles in the spring rolls are undercooked. Not cool. And the house special noodles were extra extra crispy and I'm not talking about the good crispy either. LOL. The upside is that it's open 24 hours which is really cool.",1
UGH! Typical diner and not in a good way. The problem with this place is that it's never the same. If Costco has bacon on sale she's buying it from Costco. If Restaurant Depot has it on sale she's driving all the way down there. Biscuits Cafe is so good because it's ALWAYS the same. This lady just buys the cheapest and it shows! I won't be back!,1
"Amazing club, Amazing food. the only thing i wouldn't suggest is the sushi. Its just better on the east coast. The dj was great, club was packed and the crowd was very mixed. As for the food, I got the steak and it was spot on, my girl got the chilean sea bass and it was the best i have ever had. Wasnt too expensive either.",2
"As a follow up, it's been long enough where I could have heard back from the owner, but haven't. nHowever world headquarters returned my email with a call, and gave me the list of shops in Arizona this man owns. nI will be avoiding them going forward. 1106 n gilbert mesa n1221 s gilbert mesa n3550 esouther6140 w chandler blvd n1900 w chandler n1561 n cooper rd gilbert n876 mcqueen gilbert",1
"Service was okay, but like most breakfast spots the wait between getting seated and ordering the food drinks was longer than I'd prefer. The food was decent. However, the biscuits were undercooked as well as the hash browns being too soft for my taste. The benefit of coming here is that its open 24 hrs. Nothing else around the area was open at 5 30 am.",1
"Very courteous staff and more health conscious options than is usual even for California! They sat us with a smile 10 minutes before the breakfast buffet was over, and, along with the regular fare, there was soy milk, tofu scramble, tons of fresh fruit, granola, and oatmeal with all the fixins. Rennick's for the win.",2
"Wonderful show. Great dancers and acrobats, great lighting and good music. There were also videos of some parts of Michael's performances which were so compelling to watch that I was sometimes conflicted as to whether to watch the live show or the video! I suppose if you don't like Michael Jackson at all this might not be a good fit for you, but I loved it.",2
"Just tried Laurel Market today for the first time, thanks to my fellow Yelpers I've driven by a bunch of times, but like others mentioned, it doesn't look like much from the outside. I had the Athena wrap. YUM! It was fresh and I loved the dressing on it. I could taste the hummus in every bite.mmm, can't wait to go back soon. If you haven't, definitely give Laurel Market a try!",2
"Very average if so, and expensive for the product. Coffee is again very average with almost bland consistency. Bought 2 different baked goods and they were dry and slightly oily as if the had been sitting out somewhere all day. Location was the only thing which made me try this place. I'd suggest go to Bouchon or Cafe Presse",1
Extremely rude lady works there on Sundays. Called at 1 50 p.m.and wanted to pick up a cake for my daughter's birthday. I was told that they had cakes available but to hurry because they close at 2 00 p.m. sharp. I arrived at 1 58 p.m. and the rude lady would not let me in. She kept pointing to the clock. Pool customer service. I will NEVER go back.,1
"My food was delivered an hour later then they said to expect it. That wouldn't have been as annoying if the food was worth the wait. Chicken fingers were burnt, salad was limp and slimy along with having bits of black debris mixed in it which was definitely not pepper or any seasoning of sort. I didn't even eat it. This was my first time ordering from this place, and my last.",1
"FOOD POISONING! Had oysters, beef tartare, and tuna tartare for appetizers! 12 hours of excruciating vomiting from both ends of my body. Plus our server kept touching my arms and shoulders and sat down at the table every time he stopped by. If you want to have a conversation forget it, the DJ plays way too loud to hear anything. Stay away!",1
I can sum it up in one word. Lame! Nothing really happening at this Hotel. tables are overpriced and you may get t know your dealer to well just for lack of having another person to have a convo with. Almost no night life if it wasn't for the late night cleaning crew that came out to jam. A pretty un memorable hotel. for the price you can do much better!,1
"Wow. This flowers were amazing. I have gotten tired of the crappy service from FTD and 1 800, so thought I'd find a local florist I could contact directly. This shop was great! The flowers looked so much better in person compared to the picture online, which has never happened when I've used the national companies. Now to find the same service on the other side of town!",2
"a non smoking haven in the heart of vegas. I loved our room here. Super comfy beds, incredible customer service, nice gym and quiet. You can see paris from the balcony well, we could from ours . It's passcard protected from the MGM grand, but easy enough to walk to get there. Would definitely stay again!",2
"Typical over priced coffee shop. I payed 4 for a small tea and they wouldn't even refill my press pot with hot water. ITS ONLY HOT WATER! Instead they told me I would have to pay another 4 for another tea. I don't want another tea or new tea leaves. All I want is some HOT WATER! Is that too much to ask for? Apparently. Besides that, the place is fine, good music, and very lively.",1
"This place rules. I didn't even have to drive to the office. Rather, I emailed a photo of my traffic citation to them. I paid 50 for them to take care of it. No points, and just got a call yesterday that it's all taken care of and I don't owe anything more. Thank you so much for the convenient and amazing service!",2
"I love 1. Super refreshing and the pandan jelly is yummy. It also has basil seeds, longan, and coconut slices. I've only been to two bambus and I feel like the one in my area taste a little more refreshing and crisp. The drinks come out pretty quickly but I wished this location would be opened later since it's Vegas.",2
"Food is Good, Not GREAT, especially when you consider the SERVICE is Horrible. every time you call to place a delivery the guy answering is rude and short, dont ask for reccomendations or specials, he will chew your head off. Make sure to know everything when ordering and have CC payment ready or he will lecture you.",1
"I absolutely adore this restaurant for its decor, service and delicious, flavorful food. I've thoroughly enjoyed each dish that I have ever ordered in the past year. This is one of my ""go to "" places to take out of towers and locals. Their farm to table inspired lunch and dinner menu is fantastic. I'm looking forward to trying their brunch!",2
"My date said the turkey sandwich with avocados was delicious. I ordered the ribs with chicken wings. The chicken wings looked very unappetizing with the re cooked yellowish color to it. The ribs were too sweet. The server was very personable and had great social skills. I appreciated the service, but I wouldn't return here.",1
"I felt that the Caesar salad for 12 was extremely overrated. I wanted to see what all the hype was about at Honey Salt. Ordered a carafe of wine.mediocre wine and it was 24. The service was slow and lacked in personality. I don't like to be ""bothered "" but she never came by. nI didn't know that I'll go back.",1
My first yelp review. 0 stars for this place! Horrible customer services. If you go here you will ruin you are day. They have worst manger in the entire apple sotres as well as their horrible employees. They have to learn how to talk to their customers and stop lying to themselves. They will make you feel stupid nomatter what. WORST APPLE STORE EVER PERIOD!,1
Welcoming and Nice Service. nFood is too Expensive for the Taste.I would not rate this as the best Indian restaurant in Vegas. Its just one among many. so if you live close by there is nothing wrong to try this one. nI am some one who give more value to the taste of the food than decoration so i am giving only 2 stars as i have experienced better places than this one.,1
"I can't say enough about the care and support we received from St. Joes when our baby was born. From the doctors to the nurses in NICU, everyone was compassionate, professional and went above and beyond in caring for us. Not only do the doctors and nurses have a passion for what they do, but a love for people. I wouldn't go anywhere else.",2
"If you're a hipster who wears skinny jeans, giant non prescription glasses, and porkpie hats, a millionaire who doesn't mind paying 75 for appetizers and drinks for three people, and a non claustrophobic person who enjoys being crammed into tiny spaces with no room to move your chair, you'll love this place .",1
Armando is amazing! I pulled my neck muscle the first time I went in to see him. He magically soothed out my pain made me very relax. It is crazy what a great massage can do to your body. I'm going back to him routinely for my monthly fix! He also accommodated to my request needing the day of appointment!,2
"Put your dinner in their hands! Best nobu meal i have ever had. We just asked them to bring out dish after dish after dish for our group of 12 without ordering from the menu. Every dish was spot on and better than the last. Delicious rare ingredients from parts unknown. Awesome service, awesome drinks. One of the best meals i have ever had anywhere. Expensive but amazing.",2
"If you're going for two, save yourself 70 and go to Pei Wei. Their wontooodle soup that they recommend is the biggest rip off. Ramen is 100x better. The wonton soup was not all we had, but everything we ate was so disappointing. I don't know what the people that rated this place good could have possibly eaten that was decent. Don't eat eat here. There are much better options in Vegas.",1
"Very disappointing. For a 100 meal for 2, I would expect something more than amateur, overcooked, falsely seasoned entr u00e9es. Gordan Ramsey please yell at these bloody clowns! Forgot to mention I felt bloated for 4 hours following our dinner and dreamed of vomiting over 50 worth of food. The only thing that kept me from doing so was the thought of tasting this food again.",1
"oh hell there isn't much i can add to fez to convince people to come here. they have an awesome mens restroom. oh yea.and the hummus is awesome.but i'm sure you all know that already. burgers are good, breakfast menu is pretty good. drinks are always good. never weak. service is good. figured it was time to yelp it since last night was the first time i've been here in 6 months. lol.",2
"I'm going with Gabi on this one kiss ass that I am and raising it one star. I'm all about customer service. And the ladies serving up the joe at yelp office hours were perky and aromatic. Just like the coffee! Just remember. No cell phone at the counter.we don't want Mama Dearest Java Coffee House now do we!? ""NO CELL PHONES AT THE COUUUUNNNTTTER! """,2
"Stunningly mediocre. I had never had bland oysters before. The saltines that came with them were stale. I couldn't finish the beer the server recommended, and the steak required significant amounts of A1 to even attempt. The mashed potatoes were passable at best. Drive the extra ways into Charlotte to get a real steak or seafood dinner. Bleh.",1
"So it's no Lawrys, for for less than 20 for prime rib, you can't go wrong. I heard about this place from my cousin, and we all decided to try it. It's off the strip, at The Orleans, but it's pretty good for it's price. If you don't mind driving, I'd reccomend it to people, and I'd probably go there again. The service was very good and the wait staff was very attentive.",2
"remodeled rooms are nice, w bigscreens, new carpet cool sinks. it is total BS that with about 21 floors, there are ice machines only on floors 18 21 , and of course they are tapped unless yer extremely lucky. i get comp rooms here with my modest play i've never had a negative experience on the casino floor. i dig it",2
"Super slow service. The pretzels were just flat out yucky, they were hard. The pizza was okay, pretty skimpy on the toppings. There was no feta literally 4 pieces of sun dried tomatoes a few very finely sliced onion. The crust is different a bit soggy. Never offered a drink refill. Had to ask for the waiter to take our menus. n We will not be back.",1
"Awful. Don't waste your time and money on this ""burlesque "" rip off. I've seen burlesque and cabaret shows before, and typically there is some talent and humor involved. Although a couple of the dancers were somewhat talented, Peep Show was not funny it was depressing and pathetic and hard to watch. Seriously, people. Just say NO.",1
"I will be surprised if this place is open another 6 months. Not because we were the only ones there from 6 7, not because you couldn't find a bag for the carry out container, not because the food was bland and tasteless. Because there are so many other great choices at Mekong that try to at least appear to care. Step it up or step aside.",1
"I was excited to have a pita shop so close to home, however watching the cook heat up pre cooked meat was not what I expected. Watched the cook open the drawer under the cook top to retrieve the pre cooked meat and then slam the drawer with his foot numerous times. The chicken pita that I received tasted like pre cooked boiled chicken. For the price, I expected way more. Wont be returning.",1
"To all those who join Planet Fitness, make sure that you read your contract! I thought that my contract automatically ended in 1 year and it did not, according to Planet Fitness your contract renews itself month to month after 1 year Planet Fitness ""Say "" that they review your contract with you, and they do not, so make sure you understand your contract!",1
"Wait staff at the front counter were awful! Not kid friendly in menu choices drink counter. Only accepts cash or checks, does not take debit credit cards. Pizza is below average over priced. Caters to white headed senior snowbirds. The organ is the obvious highlight. Stay away during snowbird season or if tour bus is in the parking lot!",1
"one of the best places on town for finding anything you want from the past. the owner, cindy, is an absolutely amazing woman who has given the city of las vegas a venue to show art. she supports the art community with so much enthusiasm. her shop is a MUST GO if you like the weird, the zany or just love looking at old vintage things. i would highly recommend this place to anyone.love it.",2
Passed SW Swelch on the way to get bagels from St Viatur. A photography book in the display caught my eye so I went in to have a closer look. The owner is a friendly guy and we had a chat about phones and cameras. There's a good selection of what appears to be out of print and collectible books. The prices are very reasonable. I got a coffee table book for 20. Visited on 12 Nov 2013.,2
"Sound system music was too loud to hear Popovich. Show was not worth the Groupon discounted rate! Sorry, people shouldn't waste their time with this one! I really didn't like the Pre check in fleecing, trying to sell upgrades for seating, alchobol and discounted coupons for another show. They just use up your time and ruin a casual wait before a show! I'd rather spend that time with my wife!",1
This walmart is definitely a total shit and some of the employees suck.u can't find anything here also I went 8 pm to buy a cake and there was no one at that counter.they also closes their customer service center 10 pm.if u go at 10.01 pm u will find it close.how punctual they are!then why it is written that they provide 24 7 customer service. Ughhh.,1
We like coming here though we are not regulars. You can get decent Mexican dishes in what I think of as TexMex style. My wife loves pollo fundido. I get a burrito. I enjoy the margaritas. Service is always good. Parking is normally easy. There are lunch specials and then a happy hour so there are bargains most of the day.,2
"Friendly Staff, Great Tanning beds, The baskets are the BEST! I suggest signing up for a membership. I have tanned all over the valley and by far, I have gotten the Tannest at Sunchain. They never try to up sell you or trick you into buying anything that doesn't work. I have loved every lotion they have suggested. The Mystics are great as well. They have good packages if you buy in bulk!",2
"This was the first five diamond restaurant in Las Vegas and essentially started the celebrity chef wars in Las Vegas. That is, after this restaurant came out casinos started to grow out of their 5 buffet strategies and moved into recruiting heavy hitters from the culinary world on to the strip. After all these years and all the moves, Picasso is still a player on the Las Vegas food scene.",2
Ashley has moved locations! She is now in a much larger location with multiple rooms and even a cute waterfall. She now offers nail and massage services at her place. Her new combined service option is so awesome! I was there for under 2 hours and got a gel mani pedi and lash fill. Pretty awesome! Go see Ashley!,2
"SUPPORT THIS DRY CLEANER! I love them! They are quick, awesome and affordable! I also love that in early 2013 a clerk gave me a heads up my metro cop x husband was a liar and a cheat and I was able to call him out.he obviously was so mad he started using a different location but THATS GOOD QUALITY SERVICE thank you!",2
I have been here probably 4 5 times and havent been disappointed even once ! The coffee is very gud.On Fiday nites they have a karaoke outside on the lawn.I think most of the local folks stayin in and around glendale downtown come here to have a fuite ! The coffee shop is a house converted.It has room with nice neat things which is nice to see.I have a gud time every time i go here !,2
"My full set with gel cost 50, however they did a fabulous job! Way better than any salons I've been to in Southern California! I showed her a picture of what I wanted, and she replicated it perfectly. I will be visiting this salon again! The staff were friendly, accommodating, and I'm very satisfied with my service!",2
tip best buffet from the buffet of buffets that do not need to add additional money to get in. the thick steak sauce with mushrooms is very good. crepe station has a handful of sweet and savory crepes to choose from. the potato leek soup is shared with other buffets like the spice market. has refined items like smoked salmon. grilled foods were very rough. cocktail shrimp small and unpeeled.,2
"I know better than to expect great sushi in Charlotte, but I just ate here about a week ago and I wasn't just disappointed I was grossed out. The raw fish sushi was warmer than room temperature. How dangerous is that? My dining companion eats here regularly why? and states that is normal. I value my health too much to try it again.",1
"Visited with clients for an evening out. Two of us ordered the meatloaf, one ordered salmon, and the other the chicken. Everything was prepared exceptionally and they did not skimp on portion size, either. Even though it was a slow evening for them, our waitress allowed us plenty of time to converse and enjoy the evening. We'll be back! One note I wish their wine list was more extensive.",2
"This place is a great idea. I have been wanting to check it our for months and finally got in. I was hoping to get some new pots and pans, but nothing caught my eye. They have a little bit of everything and it is all in good shape! My mother bought 2 sets of glasses from the 50 off room in the back for 25. What a deal!",2
"Very disappointing. 100 bill and poor service, sub par entrees. The place has a great vibe but for what they're charging, I expect better service. Even with 2 servers assigned to our table, we never saw either of them. Suckling pig, although recommended by the waitress was very dry and lacked flavor. Sadly disappointed in this one, Emeril.",1
"The service here was horrible. Homeboy was giving dirty looks and staring off at God knows what the entire time. I guess the kids behind counter were so preoccupied with how long the line was getting, they decided to quickly make my Mint Oreo blizzard crappie. So the outcome was more of your typical Oreo blizzard with random tastes of the mint flavored syrup. Yuck.",1
"JANELLE at R Salon is THE BEST with color! Shes the kind of colorist who knows what you want before you do. Ive gone to her for years and always have people asking me where i get my hair done at. And the salon is great! Very welcoming! Always have had a great experience with her, youll never leave without fabulous hair!",2
Not worth the time or money. Disappointed. Dunkin donuts is one of my family and Is favorite past time from the east coast. However the quality of food and service at this location is terrible. Customer service should always be a priority however here they are extremely rude. You will wait forever and your food comes out spilled upside down in your bag. Don't go,1
"The first time I went to Al's was on a cheat day during a no carb diet. The first donut I had was a freshly made Cronut, he was icing a batch with a honey glaze when I walked in the door. Biting into that hot and still sticky b c the glaze hasn't had time to harden yet donut. been chasing that dragon ever since. Great donuts. Get them fresh and they are even better. Non donut offerings? meh.",2
Thought this show was great. There was way more interaction with the audience than other Cirque shows I had seen. Very funny. There was talking dialouge where that doesn't happen in shows like Mystere or Ka. Found it highly entertaining and we had lower bowl seats that were amazing! It's not quite as raunchy as one might think.,2
"Gotta love this restaurant ! Been going there since 1995. When you go there, make sure you talk to Olympia the owner. Ask.her all about her favorite vacation spot, Amalfi Italy. All the recipes are from her home country Italy transported to America The atmosphere is very simple but the food is wonderful!",2
"Disappointed. First time when I went there, the line was too long so I left. A year went by, I had another chance to try the place. After waited in such a long line and paid that much money. I was very disappointed. The food was so so, nothing stood out. The services were average but below par if you considered it's in a hotel. You will have a lot better buffet in Paris, trust me.",1
I've been here about five times now and it never disappoints. This is the first time I've strayed away from Ribeye.I went with the bone in filet. And it was one of the best steaks I've ever consumed. I seriously considered picking up the bone and gnawing on it to get more meat. My must haves on the side are the lobster bisque and the creamed corn. Can't wait to go back again.,2
If you like to be deaf for two nights after a night of partying this is your place. It's a trend place like all night clubs are. I felt there are better clubs in Las Vegas. My two warings are drinks are way over price and don't set napkins on fire. Outside of that you have a good time waiting inline.,1
Every time my group of friends go to Millers we sit down and then get up 5 10min later to get our own beers because the service sucks so bad then about 30min after that we all decide to go eat somewhere else because we still have test to be asked what we want to eat. So it's a good place to go grab a pre dinner drink at the bar but don't bother going there to eat dinner.,1
"yum! I was super happy to see this location open up here iorth scottsdale, i was tired of driving over to the biltamore location. The seating is nice and the patio will be a great place in winter to sit! The kobe beef is some of the best meat you can get and the spicy burger is the best, not to spicy but just right!",2
"My mom and I went there for happy hour. We ordered the tableside guacamole. It was ok. Nothing special. When we received our bill, they not only tried to charge us full price for our drinks, they tried to charge us for premium liquors we never ordered. We had to call a manager over to fix it. They tried to overcharge us by 30. I will never go back here.",1
"My friend Kristen works here as a piercer, so I got to hang out with some of the staff recently. They are all super cool people, and from the looks of it, they all excel as their jobs. I'm not pierced or tattooed, but if I was, this would definitely be the first place I would go. Haven't heard of one complaint yet from the people that have gotten their work done here.",2
"Was there Saturday, 6 28. Worst DJ I've heard in years. Security staff was very nice, but waitresses only interested in the parties of guys flashing their credit cards. We had a private table and were basically ignored by her most of the night. Oh and 55 for water? That's why I love CA they are required by law to give you free water!",1
"This will get 2 stars from me simply because it's closed on Saturday. I spent the day shopping for furniture wanted to see some cool designs get inspired. How are you closed on a Saturday only open Monday through Friday. Unless theres something I'm missing about this place. I will update my review when i return during the week. But for now, meh you gets the 2 stars buddy! lol",1
"One of the best places I've eaten in a long time! We split the new york strip steak, roasted asparagus, mashed potatoes, then the funnel cake for dessert. Everything was so delicious and cooked perfectly! Service was excellent and if you can, get a seat outside cause it's a great view and they even do a show. Definitely coming back here next time we visit!",2
"The decor is great the service is good, but the food isn't very good. I want to like it because it looks so nice, but the sushi is no better than any average place in Vegas. We had lobster miso soup,Caliorina rolls, tiger rolls kenko rolls, none of them anything special. For the price I was expecting to have much better sushi. Nearly any place in Vegas is better than this. I wouldn't return.",1
"Drove up from Tucson to catch The Airborne Toxic Event last week. ATE kicked ass, Marquee, not so much. Overpriced, piss warm brews and sound work could have been better. Would I make the trip again to see another kick ass band? Yup, but this place could really be bad ass with a little attention to detail.",1
"It was around 6 pm dinner time and they were out of a lot of food. I then decided to order something from the ""anytime "" menu which is mostly breakfast sfuff. I figure I can wait for them to cook something from the ""anytime "" menu. Well, the lady working said they weren't serving anything from that menu at that time. Wtf? Why do you have that on your menu then? Get it together!",1
I used to stay here in the past but not anymore. They cut way back on a lot of things like quality of service for drinks and cocktails. Forget the buffet they don't have one anymore they expect you to fork over money to eat shit at the house of lords. This used to be an alright place to stay but not anymore. Better to go stay else where.,1
"BEWARE THE 12 LAULAU PLATE FROM ISLAND LOCO! No chicken or fish, the whole container was dripping with fat I got it all over my clothes and phone , when I opened the taro leaf it was full of big chunks of fat, and the lomi salmon had exactly 3 little diced pieces of salmon. I took it back for a refund, and he would only refund half the cost. What a ripoff!",1
"Celebrated my Valentines dinner here with a beautiful view, wonderful service, and unbelievable food! The taste of that hanger steak and frites still lingers in my memory, each and every day. This place has made it's way to the top of my ""must dos in Vegas "" nUntil we meet again, hanger steak. Au revoir ' ",2
"Best. Thai food. Ever. My boyfriend and I discovered this place on Christmas it was the only place nearby that was open . I think we went back 5 times in the next month after that! The food is THAT good and I am not a huge fan of thai. I recommend to anyone in the mood for thai food, novice to experienced!",2
"Excellent food. nThe proprietor is happy to come out and explain every dish. The menu is not limited, and the bar is stocked with top shelf liquor. nAnd what you can eat here is not restricted to what is on the menu. For example, the owner mentioned several additional types of naan they would serve us. We ordered the naan with raisins.",2
"I came to Rita's with a rush job and she was wonderful! She had my dress done within 24 hours. She did a beautiful job and my dress looks very professionally done. I would give it 5 stars except that she takes cash only. My job was small and not over priced but if I had a large order, I'm not sure I would have cash to pay for it.",2
"Dinned there with my family. The food was very good but nothing really special. We ordered few salads, pea soup, asparagus, risotto, baked potato, salmon and most of it was good. The only thing I would skip is the asparagus salad. nThe service was excellent! nI recommend the restaurant. Maybe I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't eat meat.",2
"I have never, in my 30 years, experienced a dental office as great as this one. From the first phone call to schedule my appointment to the cleaning, exam and beyond, I have been blown away by everyone I've had the pleasure of coming into contact with. Great staff, great doctors, everything is explained, no pressure to do unneeded procedures. I literally cannot find one negative thing to write.",2
"Hands down my favorite Mexican joint in Vegas. Being from California I'm used to the real authentic flavors that places all over back home have Roberto's provides that here. My favorite is the Asada Burrito, the meat is super flavorful the burrito is the size of 2 at other joints. This is perfect for anytime of the day or night with most open 24 hours Roberto's is always an option",2
" 3 for Sharing. What a rip off, we had a sandwich family style and they charged us 3. We got nothing extra for sharing. Basically they bring you a sandwich, get an extra plate, 3. Its not like they are splitting the sandwich up inside the kitchen or giving you extra bread. If a Chinese restaurant had that policy, it would be 3 more on every item. Crazy business practice.",1
"After reading so many positive reviews for Lights Out I thought I would give them a try. Long story short, I called and left a message. The following day I received a voicemail from them. Over the next 3 days I called and left 4 messages asking for a call back. I am still waiting. Every business can experience some snags but not returning voicemails is unacceptable.",1
"It's fun to visit this store once in awhile. If you are a fan of M M's, then you must visit this place! The store is located beside MGM Grand on the Strip. It has four floors filled with M M merchandise! So they have pretty much everything one could ever want related to M M candies and characters. It's worth visiting especially if you have children or just like M M candies.",2
"Screw the prime rib, the crab legs are where it's at! I came out here a long time ago and had one of my first Las Vegas' buffets at Mandalay Bay. So when I came back here a while ago, I decided to try here again. And I wasn't disappointed at all. Sure, the prices may have increased over the years, but the quality of the food is still there in my opinion.",2
"I go here all the time. I like buying random books though. Plus they are half price and they have a clearance section on top that. They also have cool little knick knack gadget stuff, which is always fun! I don't find the staff to be particularly helpful but I'm able to find stuff on my own so it's not a big deal!",2
"I did not partake in sampling their GINORMOUS scotch collection, next time better watch out Burgundy! The Poutine week special with the rabbit meat or was it duck meat added an interesting twist to a classic. Had a random celebrity sighting shook hands with Justin Trudeau and merriment with friends was had. If you are a scotch lover, this is the place to be.",2
"Best pho I've ever had, hands down, coming from Sacramento, I come from a very heavily vietnamese populated area where pho is always readily available but the stuff here takes the cake. It was bomb af and the portions are heavy, I'll definitely come back here and try the phozilla challenge, win that jackpot, baby!",2
"Best NY pizza ever! You will love the garlic buttered crust and their perfect sauce. Get there! Now! Bad reviews are likely competitors or agents for competitors IMO. The pizza business is super competitive. These guys will crush their competition. I work in Mesa and stumbled upon this place one day at lunch. Brought it back to work and EVERYONE who tried it, loved it.",2
"As long as you don't mind a bit of a wait, this place is great. The chicken tiki masala is to die for. The staff is super courteous. They have a ton of different craft beers a huge plus and 3 dollar Irish carbombs. Perfect Friday night dinner. Just don't attempt to come with more than 4 people. you will never get a seat together.",2
This hotel is old and outdated. It needs to be torn down and rebuilt. The non smoking rooms smell of mold. The spout in the bathtub fell off when I touched it. We saw a leaky roof in the hallway. It's probably the cheapest hotel on the Strip though. So it's a good place to stay if you can't afford something better.,1
"This massive bar on St Jacques is plastered in TVs and screens so that you can catch every moment and every play from your favorite sporting events. They have a vast food menu for a bar, quite a few choices of beer and drinks and really low prices. If you're in the area or if you want a change from the regular downtown bars, PJs a good bet. Try their Subs, I really enjoyed mine!",2
Having moved 15 times and having been referred to Classic Delivery WHAT A NIGHTMARE. VERY unprofessional and S L O W! A move that should have takeo more than 6 hours stretched out to 10 hours. The movers seemed to be strickly out of prison.just a TOTAL HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Would DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMEND.,1
"We stopped in for take out, so I can only comment on the food. We had the ""Lion "" Roll, ""Super Shrimp Tempura "" Roll, ""Spicy Crunch Dynamite "" Roll and a modified ""New York "" Roll. We were both pleasantly surprised with all the rolls we ordered. I can honestly say we will be ordering food from J.K. Sushi again soon.",2
"Food is terrible! Ordered a rueben and what I got was burnt, soggy bread with tsp. of cabbage slaw and rubbery deli meat! Service was lacking even though the restaurant was empty on a busy Saturday at the Mall. should have been a warning ! The manager erased the bill but left me lacking for a real rueben!",1
I was not disappointed with the church itself but by a few of its parishioners. Two people were nice enough to hold the door open for me and my 6 year old son who uses a walker he has cerebral palsy. But three others rudely stepped OVER him and his walker as he slowly tried to go through the first and second set of doors. Very disheartening. Very rude!,1
"From the moment my friends and I drove up to the restaurant, I knew I was in for a treat. I feel so welcomed at the restaurant. I was very impressed with the food and the service. I ordered a ribeye steak and that was the best steak I have had in a very long time. While the prices are a little steep, you do get what you pay for and I will be back! I love Donovan's.",2
"If you are rushing from point A to point B, and find yourself at the intersection of 27th Ave and Camelback, this Jack In The Box will get your order right. I've picked up many a Diet Coke here, plus the occasional lunch. Sometimes it's busy, but you can count on friendly service and accurate order fulfillment.",2
I walked in with very high hopes and walked out very disappointed. It really reminded me of one of those weird grocery stores in London where all the food is pre packaged and icky. All I really wanted was a head of lettuce and some nice produce. I walked out with nothing. EVERYTHING is packaged. I had know idea! This place is anything but Fresh. Easy yes.fresh no. I will stick to Trader Joe's.,1
"Extremely rude and unprofessional, not to mention they do not know what they are doing. I took my scooter in for a check up and asked if they could fix my oil leak since it had been leaking all over my driveway for a while. They said they would not fix the leak because ""it would take too long and be too much work "". I don't understand how this place is still in business.",1
"This is my ultimate favorite restaurant bar in Henderson! Food is always great, the experience as a sport fan is phenomenal, and the management and staff are A1! Tony and Jasmine are always on top of things and are there everytime I come in. They make you feel like family I can't wait till football starts!",2
"While not your typical cirque, still an amazing show! If you're looking for the crazy aerobatics, another show like O at the Bellagio might be better. However if you love the music, amazing dancing, crazy lights and effects then you'll love it! And as amazing as the dancers are when they're dancing with MJ you know he's the king!",2
"I come from NY so I have had some good Japanese food. This will be the closest Pittsburgh will ever get to it, and yet something about it just turns me off. It's not the best I've ever had, and yet they charge you as if it is. Maybe the reason I hate this place so damn much is because they're just unnecessarily expensive.",1
"This is a crappy store. all they have is bulk Ashley furniture and the manager of the store Veronica is a scam artist.they just rob you off your money.I ordered some furnitre and had to wait a week to get it from the store, when i went there there was only part of the order and new they wanted me to pay 99 for delivery.Avoid them by any means.",1
"Bun thit nuong i order was stale nWhen i told them about it nThey brought out a side order of fresh vermicille right away nI m like you guy probably try to give me the old vermicelle one first, nkind of pricey ,guess cause it s in Vegas nPho was good portion size was kinda small ,i can eat 2 bowl to fill me up",1
"What a wonderful staff they have here. Great customer service. Very friendly and energetic. I'm so glad they open this place near me. I always get the vegetarian sandwich. It's perfect and it's delightful. The nuts about berries salad, is phenomenal. Strawberries berries and a hint of cinnamon with nuts. Im obsessed ",2
"Loved my nail appointment! nJust had a great nail experience at Bond with Valerie. Meticulous. Very nice girl. nThe decor is very cool. Sitting next to me the client was getting a great design set . nVery pointed and Black, Grey and White. nThat tech was very nice too. All in all a great experience. Clean and felt good to be there. I will go back!",2
"We went there just because the restaurant is rated 4 star, however, the chicken was overcooked both in the Tom Yum Soup and curry dish. The 10 dollar overprice lack of ingredient Tom Yum Chicken Soup was extremely sour, the lime flavor was too overwhelming, curry dish was too watery. food was ""ehh. "" but the service was good!",1
"Visting Las Vegas for the first time, staying at the Rio was a true Las Vegas expirience. The ambiance is amazing. The casino is clean and busy all the time. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful and the food and bars were great. The pool has an amazing set up and the whole hotel promotes true Las Vegas style fun!",2
"Been going to XS for three years now and I'm confident to say that this is one of the best clubs in the world. I've been all over the world and have partied in all the hot spots including Ibiza. Great layout, draws a classier and very HOT crowd. Plenty of room to dance and the night swims during pool season are EPIC. I just hope they revamp their dj residency. Avicii is old.",2
"Friendly, very clean and lots of color choices. Had a pedicure with Miley and she did a great job and did not skimp on the services or products. I upgraded to callus removal and got the spoil me rotten pedicure which included a leg mask and generous foot and leg massage. I asked for additional callus scrubbing for certain spots and it was received well.",2
"The food here is just as good as any other Greek place. But that woman behind the counter is just a B ! The way she talks to her employees, like they are her slaves then turns to the customer like nothing happened. If a mistake is made she blows it off and infers it's the customers problem. I'd rather go to the mall rather than take her crap!",1
"Walking distance to Chase Field makes this a popular destination. The Mexican food is very good, the drinks are cheap, they have a huge outdoor patio, a large bar area, and you can wobble over to the ballgame when you're finished. If you get here early enough you can park in their own private lot for free.",2
I just accepted a beautiful ring from Hennes. I have had nothing but compliments and I must say that the ring was beautiful. Unfortunately within 4 days one of the diamonds on the halo was missing. I'm sure that this is a fluke and will be taken care of. But my new fianc u00e9 is very upset by this.,1
"I visited this location a few times during my stay in Las Vegas. This location is far better than my home gym, the 24HF in downtown Oakland it's cleaner and just in better condition overall. The machines and equipment are new and in excellent condition. The layout is pretty good and it never seemed to get very crowded. I would definitely return if I were in the area.",2
Great Mexican authentic food. Read about this place and decided to try it next time I was in Vegas It's like El Toritos Mexican food but better. The hot bean dip they bring to the table is good. I ordered the chese enchilada and beef taco hard shell you don't see hard shells these days anymore. Service and ambience were good. I would returext time in Vegas.,2
"I called at 3 30 before I left home and verified that they served lunch till 4 00. I came in and sat down at 3 50 and was handed a dinner menu. After that I wouldn't have eaten here at all if I wasn't meeting someone for our late lunch. The food wasn't anything to brag or complain about. With the great selection of chinese food within two miles to the West, I won't be coming back here.",1
"SO happy I called Bobi at Your Helping Hands. The team of ladies she and Cindy sent out were punctual, friendly, and very thorough in cleaning our home, and getting it ready for sale. The work was done within the time frame I was given, and I am very happy with the results. I know who to call again when we need helping hands.",2
Had a 6 00 pm reservation and let them know that I was attending an 8 00 pm concert in the hotel. Service was terrible. We didn't receive our salads and soups until 6 55 and our entrees didn't come until 7 35. The steaks came rare which is not what was ordered and the shrimp was way overcooked. This place is way too expensive for such crappy service and food.,1
"Mozen Bistro at the Mandarin Oriental gives their customers EXACTLY what they pay for.tasteful decor, outstanding service, excellent food quality AND presentation. Adding to my brunch love affair, their unlimited Veuve Clicquot for only 35 seriously had me considering forwarding my mail to Mozen Bistro.",2
"Honestly. How can you mess up a simple order of grilled cheese with bacon and give NO BACON. The beer was nasty and bottom of the barrel, the 'tap was out' and then you proceed to give me a cold plate of COLD LIMP BACON to make up for the mistake. This is a MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT. I'll think twice before I come back.",1
"I ordered the Billionaire burger with sweet potato fries. I had high hopes from the reviews and was anxious to try a burger with foie gras. How can a burger that cost 28 with foie gras let me down? Unfortunately it did. Worth a try, but I wouldn't be back. The highlight of my meal the sweet potato fries.",1
"This is the worst post office I have ever been to. I have lived all over the world and used scores of them. The people here move like they have no purpose and couldn't care less about you and your needs. If the government is going to shut down post offices to save money, this should be the first one to go.",1
"We have not had Burger King in years, and decided to give it try. nQuite a mistake! We even had a ""Buy one original chicken sandwich and receive one free. "" Wow. This was the worst excuse for a sandwich ever! nSome type of microwaved patty . Absolutely horrible. The fries were terrible as well. nDo yourself a favor, cook at home!",1
"Very cool and personable staff. They smile and you can see they have teeth. Lisa the hygienist is awesome, friendly, knowledgeable and makes it a very comfortable. Dr Steinberg treats me like a regular guy and was very conscious about making me comfortable and limit the pain. Even apologizes every time I winced. State of the art equipment. I've never seen my teeth in HD.",2
I have never written a review on yelp. I actually signed up for yelp simply to write this review. I have been to some of the best and worst places all over the country. I travel quite a bit. The service and unfriendly staff needs to be fixed. Waited 20 minutes before someone even looked at me. The chili was awful. But the beer is fantastic. Awful service!,1
"There pizza is really good, I love their buffalo and BBQ chicken Pizza's. I'm heard that their sandwiches are pretty good, so I plan on trying that next time. The only thing is that they only have halal grilled chicken and nothing else is halal, so hopefully they'll be adding some more halal options and I think they should be open 24 hours. The owner and employees are really nice too.",2
"Been customer for years, got home with my white 3 meat large pizza and wings! Wow wings always good and as expected for my 25 honey hots! But my 3 meat white pizza was missing meat! Every edge and 2 in from the edge had no stinking meat? I'm like what went wrong when I got home! nWe should have called but what's the point nWhen I have super hungry people, so next time I have to check it I guess!",1
OK so my problem is not with the dentist. No my issue is with the idiot nurses who have no clue how to work with children. The attitude and the negative vibes these two douches put off made my kids uncomfortable and made them cry. Then these two douches look at me like it's the children's fault. Avoid this place it may be new and flashy but terrible service,1
"Plus points for decor, minus points for price. I was a bit surprised to find that the basic pedicure was 32, when anywhere else you'd pay 25 or less. I thought the experience was pretty comparable to anywhere else and couldn't really justify coming back to pay more just because the walls are pretty.",1
"This is a nice cafe which overlooks the hotel's swimming pool. Outdoor or indoor seating is available, along with a separate bar area. The food my party ordered was very good. The French Onion soup was quite enjoyable, the club sandwich ordered was a large portion and tasted good, and the Vegan Blackberry Tart was delicious the crust is a bit difficult to cut into, but delicious nonetheless .",2
went this weekend after someone recommended it. Very good! We enjoyed the black and bleu sliders with sweet potato fries. I liked that the fries were very thin. Their milkshakes are amazing. My kids had the chocolate peanut butter and malted milk ball and they LOVED them. The staff was very friendly and helpful.,2
"Amazing place. Service and food was off the chain! A MUST HAVE IS THE FISH BURGER. THE LAVA CHOCOLATE CAKE.I'll take a picture of it before it's all gone lol. Love this place even with the long wait I had the Emily the waitress, loveedd her earrings, and she was really courteous, informational just a complete pleasure Ryoji who periodically filled for water, who btw is complete eye candy ",2
We had breakfast at the Buffet. I figured breakfast is pretty difficult to mess up. Paid 40 for two of us. There was no fruit. The coffee and juice were horrible. The pastries were bland. The only reason I gave it two stars is the omelet bar. The chef was working his butt off and my omelet was pretty tasty.,1
"For the love of God, please tear this location down or revamp it. The adjacent Campus Vista neighborhood is well kept up and this eyesore only serves to make the neighborhood seem run down and sketchy. There is always a security guard out front and a constant cast of unsavory characters every time I reluctantly venture in. Please make better use of this great real estate!",1
"Waren zum Brunchen da, das Angebot ist preisleistungstechnisch nicht angemessen. nObwohl das Bruncheoch einige Stunden andauern sollte, wurden die kleinen leeren Platteicht aufgef u00fcllt. nEs gab keine gekochten Eier sonderur R u00fchrei das zum eineicht jedermanns Ding ist und zum anderen recht sp u00e4t kam. Alles in allem ist das Brunchen hier nicht empfehlenswert.",1
"Good location. Good service. Delicious drinks with a great selection. Delectable food with a simple menu! Awesome music! Low key crowd. Never been unsatisfied. Only 2 cons in my opinion, parking on the street if there is no where else to park and smelling like the restaurant if you decide to sit inside once you leave, but worth it for the awesome food? A must try!",2
"cute, slightly touristy place. the staff kept weirdly singing to ""hit the road jack "" and other random tunes. This was entertaining odd, but we enjoyed our food No surprise chicken wrap and a pesto chicken wrap . Both were VERY good. I would eat here again. PS This place needs to make their own ranch! Homemade, buttermilk ranch dressing.",2
"What a great place for lunch. Service is fast and efficient. We loved the hot salsa, so spicy. Would definitely bring a group here. Food was delicious. Dirty Martini made pretty good for being a Margarita type restaurant. nThe beans taste homemade and not from a can. Homemade tamales are delicious. Going to take a dozen home with me! Will be back.",2
Awesome free attraction! It's so beautiful and amazing to watch! There are shows every half hour and a new song each time. That means you can watch it multiple times and get a new show each time. I've lived in Vegas for almost three years and I still don't get tired of seeing this show. Great to see if your with your family or on a gambling vacation.,2
Place is for suckers and tourists. I love the show and all but the actual store is full of overpriced crap. Example. Bell Ross watch with NYLON band is over US 3800.00 You can buy this same watch at almost any decent pawn shop for approx. US 2500.00 . So why the jacked up price? I bet you can figure it out. 100 tourist trap.,1
"This is another example of a foodie place. The food is actualy real good but the price is just inside of outragous. Come on, it's a burger. not fillet minion. Don't get me wrong, it was good but total bill was just too high for me to want to go back there. Oh and don't get me started on the parking.",1
"The service and price are fine. We are very disappointed with the food. Fried rice is the best dish that we had. Way too much batter on calamari. Shrimp tempura was very fishy. Most importantly, the sushi was not fresh, you can see it by the color of the fish. I really would not recommend this place to anyone.",1
This old lady who is working 4 17 14 11 13 am as a cashier gave me the worst service ever. I couldn't see her name on her name tag but she was rude VERY rude. Never coming back to this one. To be honest I don't even want to give 1 star but I did because I have to. She's lucky she's old. I really wanted to say something to her. Ugh.,1
Never again! 5 years and still AC that doesn't work! What a shame. Mr. Binkley is better than that. Perhaps spend less on opening new locations divert some to get a new AC! Seems obvious. Not to pick on staff also suffering through the heat but absolutely no attempts at comping anything to try to appease diners. Ample servings of excuses served instead.,1
"I've been coming here for years for the dim sum. Overall I think their dim sum is the best in Arizona especially ever since the closing of China Doll years ago. There are other places like Phoenix Palace they might have some better pastry options, but when you're wanting some good old pork shumai and shrimp dumplings which are the crux of dim sum, this is the place to go.",2
I have been eating here forever! Since I was a kid! The food is always good an the salsa is good but not the best I've ever had. The beans are eh. I would give it 5 stars but last time I went our waitress ignored us and we had to get up and find her when we needed something. Every other time the service was great. I have noticed the the staff gets a little older each year.,2
"This store has to be the worst store with worst employees! nI always shop at Amazon or Overstock but, I wanted to help the local nstore and shop here but, it was a mistake! I regret it so much I had to nput it on here at yelp. nNo wonder Sears are on there last leg! The people there deserve to be nlaid off!",1
We found this place because my doctors office wouldn't do an ultrasound before 20wks. What an amazing experience! The office is very clean and inviting. The staff is very friendly. Our little one wasn't cooperating. Just didn't want to show his face. The ultrasound tech took extra time to make sure she got some great pictures for us! We will definitely be going back for the 30wk hd ultrasound!,2
"as far as vegas buffets go this is the benchmark. super clea super accomodating n plenty of vegan options including sorbet, asian options, oatmeal, fruit, salad, soy milk n fast service n FUN TIME i had the best time at this all you can drink buffet and i think the value for the dollar is fair. while this is expensive you do get a quality experience.",2
This place a is absolutely the best all around. Been here several times and the quality and freshness is superior. Happy Hour is always happy for us. The prices are very reasonable along with a good selection. Chef John has always made a point to come out and say hello. I tell everyone about this place.,2
"We went there cuz was recommended on one of the food shows. Aside from alot of food, I was really not impressed. Was just so much and flavor got all mixed together. Very good service. But will also cause a heart attack if go too often. And we also got a mango drink. Was in this hug glass. But too sweet for my taste bud.",1
"The low rate is primarily for the service. 4 employees wandering around behind the counter yawning while acting like the customer me, being the only customer in sight is interrupting them. Every table top was dirty, no customers sitting down, just empty dirty tables. nThe food was average, but slightly better than the usual airport meal.",1
"Food was excellent. Service was horrid. Had to ask for a wine list and then they proceeded to actually ""ID "" a well known actor friend of whom the reservation was under their name. I would go again but would call ahead and make specific arrangements for your group first especially if its a business dinner.",1
The show was great. It was reasonably priced and the theater was relatively small so there were no bad seats. The story line itself was enigmatic iature so I would not recommend taking younger children. It definitely lived up to its name of Mystere because I found that the group of people I went with had several different interpretations of the show. I really enjoyed the production as a whole.,2
"I am from Missouri, the land of Steak 'N Shake. I was excited when they announced plans to open a restaurant in Vegas. I thought it would be a taste of home. However, this is NO real Steak 'N Shake. The food and service is very inconsistent. I keep coming back and hoping it will be better, but sadly, it isn't. Cold burgers and fries, watery shakes, rude waitresses.",1
A A great place to let the kids go nuts considering there's not much in Vegas for kids to do. Not a bad price either 15 for 1 hour of jumping a round of laser tag. Hopefully by summer time they'll have the rock climbing wall ready. The warehouse wars laser tag is great to. I haven't seen another place in Vegas where there's different floor s just to play the game.,2
Extremely poor service and not helpful at all! My wife and i just spent the past 2 weeks on our honeymoon and Delta has done its best to make sure we NEVER use their services again. What spells romantic is 2 flights next to the toilet and the final flight my wife and i wont be sitting next to each other! So romantic! DELTA helping other airlines stay in business!,1
"Nitemare. Never been a huge fan of the franchise but most could execute the basics. Not this one. Rafts of staff wondering around aimlessly, lotsa phone chat and grab ass, poor training. Some folks seemed to care, but most thought they were at Dominos. If all they want to do is takeout they should shutter the dining room and move on.",1
"Love this place. Fantastic espresso, cappuccino, or their unique, proprietary cafe crema imported from Italy similar to coffee ice cream . Tremendous ambience with indoor and outdoor bench seating. The place is abuzz with energy, friendly and great staff, and is a wonderful people watching spot in the heart of Mile End. Muah.",2
"I hate going to the dentist, but this staff always makes it much easier to go to the dentist. They are all very friendly and professional. Dr. E Bigos has been my dentist now for six years and she is awesome. They have done my crowns and a root canal and did an excellent job on all occasions. I highly recommend North Valley Family Dentistry and all of their staff.",2
"The only good thing about this place was the chips, salsa, and bean dip. My sister and I both got burritos enchilada style. When we got our food, all we could taste was SALT. Then when we took the leftovers home, my brother in law ate them and found a hard dirt clod in the beans. We will definitely not be back! And to be honest, I wouldn't have even given it one star if I didn't have to.",1
The food was amazing and we didn't have to wait very long for it. You will get your money's worth if you love good tasting food. I don't speak French and that wasn't an issue. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to spend a bit more money for a nice dinner without having to dress too formal.or just anyone really happy guest PS try the calamari,2
"I am a big Gordon Ramsay fan so when I booked my trip to Vegas it was a no brainer that I made reservations for my wife I to eat dinner here. Though it's costly , it definitely made any every expectation I had.and then some! Food, Service Ambiance second to none ! Do yourselves a favor dine here! Gordon Ramsay IS the man!",2
"Both appetizers are cold. You can blatantly tell that the potstickers were frozen beforehand. Since no mini plates given, my napkins aren't sufficing. Asked yet still no plates. Oh, I was waiting for my entree to come but I felt like leaving since they took forever. Didn't stop by for a status either. Do I have anything more to say? No.",1
Was looking for a good Mediterranean restaurant in Phoenix as I was on vacation from California and came across gyrosology. I had the chicken shawarma and my wife tried the gyros sandwich. Both dishes were delicious with the right portions and great prices. We will definitely come back and eat here one more time before we go back to California,2
"I loved La Croissanterie Figaro. It's a perfect setting for lunch after the hike up Mont Royale. Great cafe au lait, sandwiches. The atmosphere is art nouveau cafe. Highly recommend for a relaxing break while walking around the city. The only thing that would have made our experience better was a clear day. I can imagine that lunch outside on the patio would be idyllic.",2
" 13.99 for 3 lbs of Carne asada, and cooked! This place is a must if you like asada, carnitas, and other Mexican products. Great prices! I happened to stumble in and I'm glad I found this place. It's great for pick up and go. I'm not from Phoenix but I will visit when I return. Make sure to call your order in and pick it up in about 20 30 min.",2
"What a blast! I haven't picked up a bow in 20 years, my DH had never used a bow so we were definitely amateurs. Julie was a delightful instructor, and had us all up and going io time at all. She managed to give everyone individualized attention no small feat considering there were 10 in the class. Fun date night worth the trip.",2
"Would give this shit place zero stars if possible. worst customer service ever, people are rude and inconsiderate. Booked a one night stay in a patio suite and was downgraded to a double bed when I was supposed to get a king. Sorry sir, since you booked your stay online we give you the worst rooms available.",1
"La vieja desgraciada de la panader u00eda me maltrato y me hizo sentir como s u00ed iba a pedirle el pan y no q compr u00e1rselo ,adem u00e1s insinu u00f3 que me ve u00eda como santa claus porque yo vest u00eda un abrigo de peluche, est u00fapida ojal u00e1 un d u00eda se arrepienta de causarle da u00f1o a los dem u00e1s ! Im so piss",1
"Came here for dinner as it walking distance from my hotel. Was hungry and ordered the bruschetta and some pasta. The bruschetta was on toasted wheat bread? The pasta was good. The waitresses were no doubt pure eye candy, but took them 45 minutes to give me my bill. I asked three times.I was very irritated after being on a long flight.",1
"They did a great job! Had an ant problem come out of nowhere! After hosing my patio down with three different bug sprays, ants were still all over the place. I called on Monday wanting someone today and the owner of the company came to my house same day and waited for me as I ran a little late from work. I will surely use them again!",2
"Service was slow, don't go there if you're on lunch break. I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches, poor choice and crazy EXPENSIVE! The cost for 2 sandwiches, and french fries NO DRINKS 22.00 The chicken was some kind of rubbery processed junk Dont bother going here! For 22 I could have got food for a week at In and Out",1
I give.this store four stars. I'm a fan it's true. nYou have at this location happy friendly staff who are more than willing to help you and order items for you. I own just about every system so Gamestop is my place to shop. Just give me kind staff and my life is mo better! Each time I enter I have knowledgeable staff at my finger tips so I'm as happy as a fish in water.,2
"I was so excited to try something new! I went inside and the place was really cool. When I got back to work to eat my chicken, it was raw, my chicken was bleeding. I am not sure if it's a mistake or what is going on. The portions are small for what you pay for and I like my chicken cooked. I will never go back I don't even want my money back.",1
"So with the bachelorette party of 10, you would think they could find a table for us where the girls didn't have to sit on counter height stools with their feet waving like a class of preschoolers. The service was lack luster and the food was good, but not worth the 50 per person it cost. The 'worlds best key lime pie' was gang banged by a dozen forks and voted clearly not the best.",1
"if you're a seafood restaurant and manage to botch up a raw seafood platter, something is very very wrong. half the food on ice just did not impress not to mention the ridiculous prices they charged for it. decor was gorgeous though, don't get me wrong.but if you're looking for fresh seafood go somewhere else. this place is a total rip off.",1
I am a vegetarian so I ordered a tofu entree which was pretty flavorless unless doused in soy sauce. The real reason I gave only 1 star is because my boyfriend who is only in town for two days ordered a beef entree and then spent the rest of the evening throwing it up. I expected more from this restaurant. We spent too much on our meal to spend the rest of the night throwing it up.,1
"I tried the place for the first time this morning and ordered a red velvet bagel. It took a while for them to toast it and when I got my order, the bagel was burnt. The lady said she will give me a new one and after 20 mins waiting, I still didn't get my bagel because she forgot about my order. The food looks very good but service sucks. So disappointed!",1
"NOM NOM NOM. Whenever we come here, the first two things we order is the fish ceviche and the mussels! The ceviche is perfectly limey and sour and delicious and the mussels have this awesome pico type garnish on top of them! SOOOO good! I really don't need to eat ANYTHING else when I come here as this is thje main reason I come here! Those two items are a MUST TRY!",2
"Terrible. Waitress was a sad sack of sh . The ""handheld "" we got was ridiculous and awful. Waitress was slow and discriminating on me for being with another guy. How do I know. The people beside us said she was. Will never come here again. And all my gay friends won't come here either. Absolutely awful.",1
"This is really more like 3.5 stars, but I wanted to give them more of the benefit than the doubt. Overall the food is decent, by far, one of the better non chain's out there. The pot stickers were so so, but everything else was decent. The place got busy and noisy and all of the cool air rushed out. I would go again.",2
My room was disgusting. There was trash still left from the last people that stayed in it. Dirty cups and broken glass. I could tell the beds had been laid in. I call the front desk and it took over 20mins to get me a key to a new room. I will never stay here again. They comped me the resort few. 14. Wow. Impressive.,1
Now they have ice cream! They remind me of the candy store you use to have when you were younger. They have snapples for 1.50 and can's of soda's and bottles of water for 75 cents. Now they have the ice cream cooler next to the drinks for prices 1.00 to 1.50. It's a great snack to eat when your waiting for your food,2
"Good food and beautiful space. My family and I were here the other night. We had gnocchi with duck lamb chops the fish of the day grilled salmon and the pasta trio. nThe gnocchi with the duck was outstanding. The other entrees were very good. The pasta trio last night was slightly disappointing. Ravioli, Papardelle and Penne a la Vodka lacked something. Overall, a nice meal. I would go back.",2
I was a little skeptical going here because some of the bad reviews but tried it anyways. There was no smoke smell that someone mentioned.in fact there was a sign that didn't encourage smoking in the restaurant. The sushi rolls were satisfying. My favorite was the spicy tuna roll with the ahi on top. The hamachi roll was very small and didn't taste very good but everything else was decent.,2
"This is the real deal. I HIGHLY recommend this place if you are in the mood for burgers, fries and milkshakes. The owners are friendly. The prices are unbeatable. The quality is spot on. I do not recommend the deep fried mushrooms or the grilled cheese sandwich. However the other items I mentioned are phenomenal! You must splurge on a milkshake. i love chocolate cherry.",2
Unbelievable bad service. We were at restaurant for 1hour they never say thank you and no smile. Hirame had bad smell. We tried to order ice cream she say she can't take order because her wrist hurting? Really . One ice cream she can't take the order. We ask another waitress she give us a one finger to tell us to wait! Seriously?,1
I have had quite a few items powder coated for my car from Snail Motorsports and have had nothing but a great experience and tons of complements from the work that was performed at this shop. Pricing was every bit of what i paid for. Quality and professional work and I definitely recommend this shop to anyone and everyone who asks where a good place is to get this type of work done! ,2
"O MAN! This place RAWKS! Ya baby! Luved everything about it! nStaff was patient, helpful, full of assistance. nThis was something i wanted to do for ages! na Stressed out? nb Wanna impress the significant other? nc Cool Date Nite? nd Want to do something DIFFERENT? ne all of the above Can I go back now? Pleeeeeeeeeeeease?!?!?",2
"You know that I could not return to Charlotte for a long weekend without having a meal with my friend, Louie Suppa. After Saturday night, all I can say is, ""GRANDMA! GRANDMA! GRANDMA! GRANDMA! "" This time we topped half the pie with pepperoni and meatball slices. I am really diggin' my meaty Grandma!",2
"My wife and I purchased a used 2012 Hyundai Sonata with low mileage. Our salesman, Tim, was very friendly and helpful in making the right decision on what type of car to buy. He never pressured us and he was up front about everything with the car and the buying process. We would definitely recommend Zimbrick Hyundai West to anyone looking for a great vehicle and smooth buying experience.",2
"As far as I can remember, I have yet to feel such warmth and comfort at restaurant! With the dim lights, dope beats, and friendly faces, you can't help but to want to visit The Main Ingredient more often thaecessary! The staff is amazing and I look forward to sharing a meal at The Main Ingredient with many of my friends in the near future. Regards. nE",2
Raul was the best! He was able to keep the flow of napkins coming to control the spaghetti explosion happening on our 3 year olds face. Attentive and never let our drinks get low. Great suggestions and honest opinions. Always a smile on his face helping patrons or interacting with coworkers. Thanks Raul! Ben and Brenda.,2
"I had carryout. Very quick but kinda confusing to find the place. I was expecting good things because the reviews seem to rave about this place but honestly I was really disappointed. The food is mediocre, I have had WAY better and I can't say that anything I had was really that great. I'll be looking for a different chinese place to eat at.",1
"So you're sitting at the Canopy Club, maybe you're drinking a beer and watching the band and or gawking at the scenery why not have a slice of pizza as well? The super slices are 1.75 for cheese, 2.20 for 1 topping and 2.75ish for specialty. The slices are a double slice, but they are thin, which is great if you like thin crust. They are excellent!",2
"Ordered an eggs Benedict, the chefs forgot the English muffin. Waiter then forgot to bring out the English muffin for 20 minutes. Had to ask the staff to check on the English muffin and had a side of toast brought instead. Was there at a slow time of day, shocked by service here and no apology given the entire time.",1
"Came in for breakfast lunch crowd. Told 15 20 minute wait and was seated within time told. Nothing spectacular with the menu. Typical stuff kinda small portion size, but not horribly expensive. Not really tons of flavor, but it was alright. My husband and I may go back one day. But for now I'd rather have some hearty diner type food.",1
"Wayyyy overpriced. I know its vegas, but I just can't justify spending 30 on a mediocre lobster roll. Yes, they are generous with the amount of lobster inside the roll, but my local lobster roll join is equally as generous at 13 a roll and it tastes much fresher. hmmm. I think i'd rather spend that 30 at the slots or on a buffet.",1
This IS the place to go for any shoe or leather repair. Luis has been a miracle worker. Puppy chewed the leather couch and he fixed it three times countless designer shoes have been refreshed heels fixed belts mended. He's a sweetheart and doesn't overcharge. God knows I love my shoes and I know I'm in good hands with Luis!,2
"It's a little pricey, but it's in a casino. What can you do. Their menu is HUGE! I mean, you can get just about anything your heart desires. For instance, I had the crab legs pre cracked, Amen to that and he had a jumbo hot dog. That's quite the stretch on food selection, if you ask me. We were both happy and satisfied, even if his giant hot dog cost 16.",2
"I love this place. I live in San Diego, but have to visit about once a year to deal with my rental properties,after driving around looking for a non chain dive bar, I spotted this place.it's more like a sports bar, micro brews,tv's and the food is pretty darn good. Makes dealing with rentals almost something to look forward to. I don't classify it as a dive bar though,don't think that.it's nice.",2
"Found the sushi to be very overpriced compared to other places in the area like Stingray or RA. Service was Ok, but you didnt get a warm feel from servers. The sushi itself was fine, but took a long time to prepare, and they def seem to love their tempora and specialty rolls. The prices themselves just are not worth the experience, and I would not go back again",1
"Don't bother with dollar margarita Tuesdays. They're so syrupy it's impossible to drink an entire glass. I recommend splurging an extra two bucks and going over to Madison's where they serve a delicious, fresh 3 margarita on Tuesdays. I also was not very impressed by the tacos. I don't get why there are such mediocre restaurants in such a prime location in Madison!",1
it's as bad as people say it is. nnot close to airport. n2 shuttles. ndisorganized employees who don't know what they are doing. nwaiting over an hour to get a car nhardcore upsell nonsense. ncharging an extra 10 day if you call to extend your reservation. nthe cheap rates hardly justify this kind of bs.,1
"Have been wanting to go here for a few years. Today I went, and very much enjoyed the experience. I had the Catalan omelette Schreiner's chorizo, kalamata olives, provolone, tomatoes, onions. It was quite delicious! I also had the Mexican chocolate latte, which was soooo good! It being in Scottsdale, I'm not likely to go often, but I'd return.",2
These guys wanted to charge me 100 to change a cabin air filter on my Toyota. It took me 45 seconds to change it out myself in their parking lot. Then they kept hounding me about buffing my headlight lenses for 37 a pop. They used to be really honest and reputable. Now they seem to want to prey on female patrons. It saddens me. Don't do business here if you're a woman. They'll gouge you.,1
"Great drinks, awesome late night menu. My friends and I tried to re create their Key Lime GImlets at home with minimal success, and the waiter kept his cool when I mistakenly called the Nuts and Berries drink ""Twig and Berries. "" The steak sandwich is quite possibly the most delicious thing I've ever eaten, and it is one of the things I miss most about Madison.",2
"After arriving in Phoenix, my wife and I had to get a burger at Five Guys. We then were craving some good ice cream. Checked out Yelp and the reviews definitely didn't disappoint. This place is awesome. Great atmosphere and fun environment. The ice cream was out of this world. Would recommend to anyone coming to Phoenix to check this place out. Would give it 6 STARS if I could.",2
"Broken rice and 10 different meats. There are 2 egg rolls which were really greasy and salty, there is 1 pork patty, 1 shrimp patty, 1 shimp wrapped with tofu wrap, 2 grilled shrimps, bbq pork chop , pork sausage, and shredded pork skin The meats are not flavorful. Nothing special. They can make the food less greasy so there won't be an after grease taste afterward.",1
"We are never going back! We ordered the crab cake. It was cold in the center. We also ordered the rachlette, bacon, potato pizza. There was no rachlette on the pizza. Potato was the dominate flavor on the pizza. The service was poor as well. We asked for a Bellini and we got champagne with peach schnapps inside.",1
Don't stop. Keep driving! The prices were really high for IHOP. We ordered soda that came out tasting nasty. The feel in the place was off. We packed up and left. No need spending our money on bad food if they can't even get the soda right. We even worried about how the water would taste if they thought the soda was ok.,1
"You have to try pretty hard to mess up chicken shawarma, but these guys do it in spades. Every place I've ever had chicken shawarma, its made from chicken breast that's been roasted in and sliced from a shawarma cooker. This place however, uses cut chunks of thigh meat full of grisel and connective tissue. Seriously disgusting. And don't bother with a salad unless you like it swimming in dressing.",1
"service issues have been accounted for and fixed. I have been twice recently, and the food is still the BOMB! The Bahn Mi burger is probably my favorite and this is a go to burger spot for me! Lucky for me it's close to my house and half way to the airport. Great spot to catch a bite before you get to McCarran.",2
"right on the pulse of old towight life scottsdale rd 5th ave a great place to start the night with great food and a better place to end the night best margarita i've had Ask for JJ to make you one you'll be hooked, and make sure to get a plate of fried ice cream ,yeah i duno how its done but its good.",2
"Miss Krissy. Bad customer service . In isle 5 there is a product on sale, ""lucky Charms "". Let me know I'll purchase it for you. That is why establishment close because if bad service. Lucky your store has great people like Suzy . To pick up your slack. Two thumbs up Suzy. Krissy "" god Bless you "" remember Isle 5.",1
"oh my. wow. ain't had scottish chips for quite a while. I used to actually live off these things! like everyday! salt n sauce is a special creatioo other nation seems to have got a grip on! would come back here in a heartbeat. like seriously, 2 fishcakes and a decent portion of chips for only u00a34.60. i miss scottish prices!",2
"Large pizza slizes and the prices are pretty fair. The quality on the other hand is not that great. The doe I feel like is the biggest problem with this pizza. It doesnt taste right, very bland. The pizza was also extremely greasy. When i eat 2 large slices I just felt sick because of the amount of grease i consumed. Make sure you blot some of it off.",1
"Subway is like that slapper friend of yours that you love to death, but don't like to admit to anyone that you're actually friends with. ""Where did you go last night? "" n cough cough ""suwy "". n ""Eh? Where? "" n ""Hey, look, someone dropped a fiver "". Subway is dark, cheap, and you will leave with loads of drink spilled all over you. Damn this place is fun.",2
"Renovated with new equipment and big tv s. P25 program of 8 weeks is helping me to lose weight getting me to back to shape. It is convenient if you work in Phoenix Business Plaza and workout before or after work. The staff is knowledgeable and costumer oriented. Drew, the manager is great to work with. If you don't like crowed gyms and work around the area, this is the right gym.",2
"An update to my prior review to add the final star. While I've only checked in 3 times, I've been here much more. I only gave 4 stars before because of shoddy service on one particular Saturday night in the bar. But after having been on very busy nights since then, I realize that was a one time anomaly. AG is fantastic food and service. It is my wife's number one choice for date night.",2
"First time, ordered the turkey. The sandwich was plain, cafeteria style. The tomatoes were mushy and the turkey tasted like it had been refrigerated for a long time. I only ate half of the sandwich before I couldn't stomach it anymore. The staff was friendly, and they did get my order right. However, the music was too loud.",1
"When in Las Vegas a stripclub. Visit is always in order for me and my girl! You CANNOT beat the free limo ride and entry to the club. The place is rather small and hard to find a place to sit on a crowded night. But the amount of beautiful ladies.wow! Me and my lady had a blast drinking, talking and a few dances to make the night complete. We will go again on our next. Vegas trip!",2
"Pura Vida is my favorite Vegan Restaurant in the Country hands down. The service, food and atmosphere are phenomenal. Chef Mayra created an all vegan, organic, non gmo menu that cannot go without mention. Las Vegas is a soul less hole of a city and Pura Vida is literally a place of healing. Get yourself here, it's just what you need and you will want to come back.",2
The worst fast food service I have ever received. I was asked what I ordered 3 different times at the drive thru order box and then twice more when I got to the window and it was still wrong. Took us about 20 mins total just to get through a drive thru. The food was bad as well. Overly salted and kinda rubbery and cold.,1
I had never had tapas before. Did not even know what it was. My son suggested this for lunch. nIt was amazing. the food was so good. by far one of the best meals I have ever had in Las Vegas. nThe Artichoke Toast was my favorite. Everything I tried was delicious. nThe service was excellent. nI can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.,2
"So good and you can tell the food is made from quality ingredients! Our favorites are the gyros and the feta fries, which are definitely worth the upgrade. The tzatziki sauce is really good, as is their Greek yogurt dip. I love their pita bread, it's so fresh and soft! This is our go to place when we want Greek food!",2
"Good food and better than average service in the heart of Montreal's Village area Quartier Latin . Try the Chateaubriand for two or my favorite, a rib steak. They'll bring you fries until you pop if you don't tell them to stop. Don't forget to get a bottle of wine and take it with you before you go SAQ, the liquor store in Quebec, is a block west of the restaurant.",2
"You can't go wrong with this place when you want dessert but don't want 500 calories. Almost every single one of their flavors are awesome, they switch them out on a regular basis with new ones, and all the toppings let you get a little more decadent if you want. Barely even tastes like you're eating yogurt.",2
"F u00fcr mich leider kein Einkaufserlebnis. Ich habe ein Problem mit der Frische der Produkte Haltbarkeit der Produkte z.B. im Molkerei und Fischbereich und leider bessert sich das nicht. Da f u00fcr mich die Frische das absolut wichtigste ist, kann ich dem Markt nur einen Stern geben. n Meinen sehr ausf u00fcrhlichen Bericht habe ich zusammengestrichen.",1
"Buckets of Beer are 25. Set yourself up with a few of those, chill in the sun for a bit, then hop in the lazy river and float for a while. If you want to meet some ladies, hand out ""best in river "" to the hot ones. as stupid as it sounds, it works in Vegas. True story. Oh, wear sunscreen. learned the hard way.",2
"The coffee is terrible, the bagels are nothing special, and the service is beyond slow. Maybe I'm just too used to pulling up to a Dunkin Donuts back east and watching them blow through a line of 10 people like nothing, but what was supposed to be a quick breakfast run before hitting the strip turned into a lesson about how in Vegas you need to wait in line for everything .",1
"Great service, awesome attitude and fun conversation. Andy's shop is small but BIG on service and is full of life. Your dress shoes, sneakers deadstock , holygrail , specialedition , nike , airforce1 etc.are in exceptional hands here. Swing by for a shoeshine and support this local small business today!",2
Sitting here trying to have dinner with my family and they have a DJ playing nasty explicit music and the manager said his hands are tied. The owner Bob knows about this and is fine with scaring away the families for the dinner hour. This has been going on since 430pm and its not 830pm. We will regulars but we will never be back again.,1
"If Angels came down from heaven and started a business, and they made it a sof serve business, it would taste like this! The combination between the whipped pineapple and the pineapple juice is perfection. Its the same as the one in Disneyland but sans the annoying kids, horrible lines and the 90 entrance fee. Do your self a favor and come here instead.",2
"My first time at Pho Van in Chandler. Had a order of the springs rolls and a nice bowl of pho soup. The restaurant was clean and the service with good. I would highly recommend this place to others. I normally visit Saigon Pho in Chandler, however the quality of food has gone down hill lately. This is now my fav Pho restaurant!",2
"Mirage is one of the first hotels on the Strip. At first I thought it would be some 3 stars hotel. But hey I was wrong. The pool is so huge with nice design, I loved it when I was floating around. Also many good restaurants are located here. On top of that, my room got upgraded and we got a very nicccccceee room. Yippee Did I mention the pool?",2
"I was here last week volunteering for the Special Olympics. It's not your average community pool. The Aquatic Center is huge, clean, and beautiful. They have a nice kids swimming area, lap lanes, diving boards, and few tube water slides. They have plenty of parking spaces. It is located nearby the Surprise Library. If it wasn't so far away, I would come back for a swim.",2
"Have been here multiple times, and have never been impressed. Probably my least favorite bar around Madison. The only reason I end up their is because I live so close. Food? Terrible. Every time. The last meal I had their Ruben I couldn't even finish it. It was cold, and so chewy it made my mouth soar. Also, never impressed with the bar tenders. Would not recommend to anyone.",1
"Whoa. Charlotte is just the best city, that we have a restaurant like this. nI went before the Lion King and had duck over red cabbage with fig sauce. YUM! nMy beau had kangaroo which tasted very much like beef. Excellent! nLemon drop martinis and Gay Pride outside I'm very proud to have this restaurant in our great city.",2
"I didn't really like this place. The food was really overpriced. Not shocking for a strip restaurant. The filet mignon sliders were the best thing we had. The nachos were all right, but everything else we ate was really bad. I didn't like the shrimp appetizer or the steak frites. That was the worst steak frites I've ever had. Service was ok.",1
"Review on the PH pool. nI was so excited to head to the PH pool on my recent trip to vegas. It's literallly 2 pools on the side, one for 18 and the other for families. AND THAT'S IT. The area where we you walk in from is just rows of pool chairs and concrete. nI was SO disappointed. I think I only stayed there for about 5 minutes before leaving. Waste of time.",1
"We used to love this place but yikes it has gotten pricey and the food is not that amazing. We spent 65 for two burgers, onion rings and a beer! Even by vegas standards that is pricey for a couple of burgers! The wait is long and the atmosphere is crazy noisy at best. This used to be a favorite vegas stop, but I think I have been there for my last visit.",1
"I can't believe I went to this store, every time we passed by it. All the hard candy and the gummies.the chocolate.the pastries.they're all just too inviting! So i got the bling hello kitty lollipop for 25 and 2 sets of a mix of lollipop toppers. I super love the watermelon and the blue raspberry flavors. I love it!",2
"I visit Rueben's once a year when my dad and I visit Montreal to go see a hockey game. Every year this is our dinner of choice before the game. It has never let us down. We usually order burgers or sandwiches since we are in a hurry to get to the game, and we are always served in a timely manner with a large portioned meal. Highly recommended!",2
"It's like that movie ""Showgirls "" meets the worst 90's female pop group video ever. I'm not going to completely knock it though. The pyro is fun. Especially if you're watching it from the Lavo patio. And the guys ship sinking is cheap entertainment. Certainly not worth waiting for in the middle of the summer when its totally packed. I would rather be anywhere else. One word REVAMP",1
Just walked out of this place. Wait staff flat out refused to serve me. They were too busy arguing over whose turn it was to wait on customers and I stood there for 10 minutes at the host podeum while they argued. Then they all left and ignored the customers. This is what happens when you employ 21 year old blond bimbos to run your restaurant.,1
Im not sure of we went on an off day but the service was slow. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the crab pastry with hollandaise. It was imitation and the hollandaise was obviously a powder. I could taste the butter flavored margarine on the potatoes. we will.not be going back. 30 for two people plus tip. Such a waste. Also the tables and high chairs were gross I had to wipe them down.,1
I wanted a simple oil change with a free basic wash. I didnt like trying to be upsold at every corner. I am pretty sure I was asked 10 times for additional services or upgrades. NO THANK YOU. The glas guys was WAY TOO PUSHY. It took 45 minutes for the oil change and wash. Wash was decent for being free with oil change. I probably will not go back.,1
I used to be a regular Applebee's customer at another location. The chain as a whole recently changed their Happy Hour menu and now the dishes that I used to get are not included. My boyfriend and I went out for appetizers and drinks and to sit an watch a football game and our bill was huge. I will not be going back again anytime soon.,1
"They let me fill up a competitors cup. I should have gone to the original. They told me all the frozen drinks have ten percent alcohol in it. After drinking 48 oz theirs is 50 oz while ""obese day of the week "" serves 48 I felt nothing. I even had them put in a shot of Malibu. nYelp has correctly categorized this place as Ice Cream Frozen Yogurt. Here's to Mardi Gras.",1
"Delicious sandwiches! I pass by this place often and finally stopped in to pick up something to bring home for dinner. I ordered the meatball sandwich. Very good meatballs, tasted homemade to me. I ordered a cheesesteak with jalape u00f1os for my husband. He really liked it. Good and spicy, he said.",2
"They definitely did a good job on my eyebrows, but personally the long wait, lack of customer service, and the price were not worth it. Granted, it is decorated modern and chic, but I would rather go to my hole in the wall place, where I'm in and out in 5 minutes, its cheaper, and they do an amazing job and always provide service with a smile.",1
Grrrosssss.sorry only way to describe this place! Did anyone else have the worst shower? No water pressure and just disfunctional. It was like pulling teeth to get an extra towel. I'm glad. A. I only was there for one night nB. There was a burger joint downstairs that served 2 burgers after midnight YES! nC. I did not leave with cooties,1
"We needed to accommodate 24 rugby players and this restaurant pulled it off without a hitch. Great service. Numerous chip and salsa refills. A skinny margarita made of only three ingredients agave nectar, tequila, and lime juice! One word of caution almost every dish was spicy. Perfect for my palate but not for everyone.",2
This UnAttentive nServer Melody ninside TGIF nAt the location inside of the Aliante Station is a freaking Joke . This Hoe took my order never came back to check on me .Only to ask if I needed a Freaking Box ! Do I need a Box ? This hoe will not be getting a Tip from me . she really needs to be Bishhh Smaked nLocation 7300 Aliante Parkway n 89084 1 13 2013 check 50016,1
"A lot of confusion during the entire transaction, things were not explained to me clearly. I asked several times for closing cost amounts and didn't get the amount needed until the day of closing and it was several thousand more then i was told, also they needed certified fnds at closing so this required me to make yet another trip to my bank and to Chicago title.",1
"This place is great but it's also not the best. It's nice they serve food to you but It's very pricey. Nothing on their menu is too Wow.and the selection of music is okay. They have different folders of music, and have separate singing rooms. It's like a typical asian karoke place. I like their soju though. Other than that eh. It was okay.",1
"Becca is awesome! A few of the folks there aren't the most outgoing and before I started going to Becca regularly I wasn't thrilled with the mani padi, but Becca fixed all of that. I've been going there for close to 10 years. Even though I live in Mesa, Becca at Smiley Nails is my first choice for mani pedi and waxing.",2
I called VIP taxi and told them I needed a cab ASAP and the lady Argentina said it would be there soon. I called after 10 mins and she said I would have to wait another 7 10 mins I ended up waiting 25 mins for the cab and when I got in the driver told me he just received the call to head over a few mins ago. I normally wouldn't write a review but I have a flight to catch. The driver is nice though,1
"Awesome, awesome price for Las Vegas! Our family stayed at Bally's and the Cafe was just a short walk from our hotel. The portion sizes are LARGE. They are usually very busy because of all the good reviews and services. So get there early! We had the same waitress twice while we were there. She was very warm and nice. My husband had the bigger ham steak for breakfast he's ever had here!",2
Service was not good super slow. not much cream cheese added. Bagels are ok but super small size some look bigger than others. There special cream cheese is nothing special. 3 gets you a mini bagel with lite spread of cream cheese. The place shares a space with a sandwich shop. If your looking for a good bagel skip this spot.,1
Outdoor museum so don't go in the summer. Took a class field trip here and the docent spoke clearly and was very patient with all my students. She was well informed and knew how to navigate the hundreds of questions a group of 8 year olds will ask. The museum is a must for gaining a deeper appreciation of the rich history that truly exists in this young city.,2
"If you get it to go is the best way . Food is very good. Luckily my girl friend ordered for pick up and when we got there to pick up, there was only one older guy who doing everything including cooking . We were little shock but after we tasted the food , it was great. Drunkeoodle and beef salad was great",2
Great Gyro lot of meat great bread got takeout for my wife and mother in law they had the grilled chicken salad was excellent as wel pita bread is the bomb. The falafel was decent could use some work. I have a gyro place closer to my house but Yelp rates the Palace better. Prices are fair but not amazing.,2
I've tried several of the smoothies here and they're all pretty good. Blimey Limey and Sunrise Sunset are my favorite since I don't like banana. On my most recent visit I tried the Sunrise Salsa. It's a breakfast burrito with salsa. Not bad. In the past I've had some of the chicken wraps and they've been ok. They are fresh and better than any fast food sandwiches. Also it's open 24 hours.,2
"I love going here for breakfast and lunch, mostly breakfast . Their longanisa is the best, along with the tocino. I was kind of flustered by the ""cash only "" part. They were nice enough to let me drive off and grab some cash. It's an overall good place for cheap eats. I seriously recommend breakfast. It's the best.",2
This is place is great. Hands down the best price for almost everything they have to offer. Will definitely have catering done by them. As for the taste it's close to where I used to go out of Vegas and better than a lot others around Vegas. I only tend to get the large fried rice combo that feeds 3 4 people all for under 9.00! Recently tried the wanton soup and was equally impressed.,2
Jamaican Beef Patties! It's worth the drive just for the beef patties alone. My husband likes the oxtail and we both love the rice. The spice level does vary day to day so be prepared to sweat every once in a while. LoL Just be aware it's take out only. Don't plan on eating in the actual restaurant.,2
I love all the other Cirque shows and my wife and I were very excited to see KA. It was bad. Real bad. I have no idea why anyone would rate this 4 5 stars. The story line was non existent and there was very very little action. 'O' is one of the best shows I've ever seen. This is not in that category or even close. KA gets a big thumbs down from my wife and I.,1
"If I could give 0 stars I would. We got our locks changed for one of our shops today. And Russell is who came for the call. Very unprofessional and cold. Acted as tho we inconvenienced him by scheduling services with this company. Needless to say I will not be using this company again. And Russell needs customer service training. 189 to change a lock, and be treated like nobody? NO THANK YOU!",1
"Very addicting! Fresh, moist, awesome flavor combinations. Nice, friendly, helpful staff. Hidden gem of Avondale. If you still say Sprinkles is the best you've never been here! Very disappointed in my self for living less than a mile for close to a year and not knowing about them. But maybe for the best or I'd weigh about 200 lol.",2
"Over priced bartenders who act like they are doing you a favor! Here for happy hour and ordered a beer at 3 05pm, the bartender asked for credit card, swiped the card at 3 07pm and charged us full price 9.73 per DRAFT beer . Absolutely no interest in eating here if they are this cheap on their happy hour, who knows what other shortcuts they take in the kitchen to make more .",1
"Local Queen of Chocolates, Ms. Juliette has created a modern chic cafe style ambiance, delightful desserts, and impeccable buckwheat crepes and classic flavors. One of the best crepes in my humble opinion outside of Brittany. It's open all day from 11 AM, so stop in any time for a cup of coffee, glass of wine with some classic french sweet and savory offerings.",2
"Weak. This place has gone down hill fast in the last year. The fish was not fresh the salmon had dark patches all over and the rolls kept falling apart. The chefs weren't even trying it seems, and the place was practically empty. I was a loyal customer for 5 years, but with so many sushi options in this town there is no reason to settle for poor quality and mediocre service.",1
"Don't order take out. You'll get your food faster if you order in. I've been waiting 30 minutes for the chicken tenders I ordered a half hour ago. My refund is taking even longer, and apparently, they burned my food twice. It's called lunch hour, not ruin my lunch waiting all day on twice burner chicken tenders. FYI I orders it b c I figured it's the easiest and fastest thing to make.",1
"HOORIBLE. you ask for something special on the order the pizza cooked well done and it doesn't happen. Worst thing is in got bread sticks that were coated in butter. What the world. I called the store and spoke to them answer on duty, Brain, and he acted as if this was a bother and didn't have time. Go across the street to the other pizza places.",1
"I've eaten here way too many times. I still like it once a month now. I have been weaned off my edible crack, however I can and will have that relapse. I suggest the Orange Chicken. Damn good cheesecake! The specials never change. I never order them. I will eat at least 2 baskets of their wheat bread.",2
"I love this bar. The food is healthier than other bars. Have delicious Moscow mules. The atmosphere is relaxed and lid back. There is Jenga, connect 4, battleship and skeeball. They have the coolest American Flag couch. Great atmosphere for after Giant sprig training. There dessert menu is a treat too. We had the crepe and it was delicious.",2
"The 92nd Street Cafe is a very nice place. I give it 5 stars because I go there whenever I want a Monte Cristo sandwiich. I've had other menu items as well and they are also well prepared and a pleasure. However, their Monte Cristo is why I mostly visit. They have some seating outside that's quiet and nice during the spring and fall. Definitely an option for a nice afternoon meal.",2
"Had 2, 2 tacos combos and 1coke, 18.94! What are these people thinking? Are they joking? It's unreal how these restaurants keep ripping people off, 4 tacos for almost 20 dollars, unreal, this shouldn't be over 12 dollars, if you are unable to provide food at a reasonable price, close and do something else, bc the end will be the same",1
"I heard from a couple of people that the fish and chips Friday special was something I needed to try and they were not wrong. Thankfully we were able to order our special around 12 50pm because by 1pm, they were all sold out. The service was great and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.",2
"This place is excellent for lunch or take out dinner. The Pad thai is the best in Charlotte, the green curry dish is also excellent. If you like spicy food really spicy , you need to try the Sum Tum Salad. it is made with green papaya, tomatoes and lettuce. It is fresh and flavorful. On a hot day, I can't think of something better.",2
"Frustrating. Went online yesterday to do an online transfer of my meds from another pharmacy. Got an email confirmation. Stopped by an hour after my designated time.no meds. Nothing. My transfer did not go through. nNow I have to wait three hours for my meds to be filled. Not cool. What is the point of using their online services, then getting a bogus confirmation by email?",1
"So worth the trip to Vegas! I loved the hot n spicy mild seasoning, although mild it still has a kick that will keep ur mouth burning. Trust me get at least two pounds per person, and add a pound or two of the shrimp! After having crawfish at hot n juicy, nothing else even compares. Bring it over to md pleaseeeeee!",2
"My only ""complaint "" about this hotel is that hilton.com doesn't let you select a smoking or non smoking room. I called the hotel, and was told that they only have 8 smoking rooms, so everybody gets a non smoking room by default. Although HGI has a standardized breakfast that you can get anywhere, somehow, the omelettes at breakfast somehow seemed tastier than other HGIs.",2
"I was always pleased with my cheese steak here, until this past visit. I bit down on my sandwich and drove a piece of sliced up bone into my gums. I searched the sandwich and found four large pieces of sliced up bone. No way I can go back here. Good if you don't get one with a bone, but now it is always going to be in my mind.",1
We became members of Willy Street Coop yesterday. Their produce department is great with a wide assortment. We have only shopped at the East side location. We wish the parking lot was larger and they had more parking. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Looking forward to shopping here again. Hoping they move into Sun Prairie.that would be fabulous!,2
"It was ""under construction "" when I visited yesterday, but I enjoyed dining in their cantina nonetheless. Good quality from the chips and salsa to my chicken wrap. Reasonable lunch specials, and I am guessing an amazing atmosphere from the look of the work going on in the dining room. I shall return!",2
"I tried this place because it had good reviews on Yelp. Big disappointment! As soon as I walked in, I thought to myself, ""what the hell? "" The decor in this place is non existent. Both my lunch order, as well as my girlfriend's was just as appealing as the decor in the place. Would definitely not come back here!",1
This is place is AWESOME! Don't get why it's not rated higher. They have Delicious Vegetable Curry and really good lunch buffet. The Naan is off the HOOK. Everyone I know that has eaten here loves it and this place has been awarded by NEW TIMES as well. Seriously you should come here. I usually get take out because I have small kids but the service is always great and the food is Delicious.,2
I had been here once before and I thought it was okay. But since it's close I decided to try again and it was awful. The girl was not friendly at all and all she did was gossip with the other lady. I tried asking a question and she was rude. Then she was buffing my toe nails and buffed my skin. It hurt so bad and I had a a cut for awhile after. I would never go back ever.,1
"The music, ambiance, and vibe are amazing ! Everyone dining is so happy and you can see they are really enjoying their food. My pear endive salad was great and my filet mignon medallion was phenomenal! We were a party if 8 and everyone raved about the food! I have dined here several times and have never been disappointed!",2
"Super unique menu, excellent atmosphere and definitely one of my favorites in oldtown. I just recently moved to the area and have been really enjoying all of the great venues in the oldtown area. This place however stands out above most of the other places and is one of the best places to bring people who come to visit. I highly recommend!",2
"NEVER, ever go here. Worst service and unprofessional management ever. Ordered 4 tacos and a Coke. Couldn't get that right even after 10 minutes of time. 2 cars total in the drive thru. Poorly handled by ""manager "". Just awful service! nBy the way, the 2 tacos that they did give me where barely warm. Embarrasing.",1
"cool decor, love how the grill is set as in the center of a stage. Had the BLT burger can I just say life in plastic is fantastic.a dry, juiceless burger with no flavor,no nada. a frozen patty to me. I have had way better burgers. hey, but it looked pretty and cost a pretty penny too. i say skip it or don't eat the BLT burger but all in all a major rip off!",1
"A wide variety of people mingle at this bar.classy, trashy, young, old, professional, you name it. The band was o.k., the beer was not very cold but the prices were ok for the area. This place needs to place more emphasis on bartenders that are courteous and clean in appearance. Probably the longest wait for a drink in an unpopulated establishment! Tip accordingly",1
"Absolutely LOVE this bar! The ambiance is beautiful I love the long walk down the stone steps careful ladies in high heels , the fireplace and comfy seating. My only complaint is that it is REALLY small not the place to go with a large group. The bartenders are phenomenal as is the food. Check it out for a romantic date night you won't be disappointed.",2
"This place rocks the house. nThe Foie Gras was truly to die for. I know it's been said before, but the way it melts in your mouth is unreal. The flavor is off the charts. nThe Steak Tartare was also pretty good, about on par with some of the other French restaurants I've been to in other states. nBut for a French restaurant in Phoenix, this place is a true gem.",2
"TRUE Crafted Pizza is amazing! Food is great! Atmosphere is great! Service was fast on on point! Employees very nice and friendly! I live in Los Angeles, CA and was visiting Charlotte, it reminds me of LA pizza. The variety of pizza are great! Meatball sandwich great too! Love this place, added to my list of favorite restaurants in Charlotte! TRY iT! you will love it and will return every week!",2
"Not the best italian food but if you're in the mood for italian and dont want to pay at a sit down restaurant, this place is a good option. Their spaghetti with ""meat sauce "" doesnt have that much meat. The alfredo sauce is a bit salty, but their breadsticks are yummy. Sign up for their emails for coupons!",1
"We needed something quick before a big dinner later on, so we stopped here. I had the hot caprese sandwich, and it was delicious. They put the dressing on the bread, so you get that great vinegar taste to couple up with the big chunks of mozz and tomatoes. I also had the earl grey lemonade, which I recommend trying. Wasn't overly sweet like most tea.",2
"I went there tonight for a take out and it took them an hour to finish my order, plus it took another 15 minutes to be bagged. I saw my order on the counter ready for bagging, but nobody was minding it. If I did not asked about my order, it will be just sitting there. They also forgot to put dressing on my sashimi salad. Hence, the 2 stars.",1
"The food at Dragon Noodle is actually worth 3 stars, but I'm downgrading to 2 stars for the exorbitant prices they charge. The XO string beans and the salt pepper calamari were good, but the noodles that you'd expect to be good, weren't. It's worth the cab ride to Noodle Palace on Spring Mountain. Even with the cab fare, your lunch would still cost less.",1
"Tasty filipino fast food I love their pancit miki bihon and moreover, the palabok. Fried chicken is fried chicken so there's no real way to mess up cooking regular breaded fried chicken but this is one of the must stop by places if you are pinoy visiting Vegas and live somewhere without all the filipino goodness!",2
We didnt have a reservation on a busy Saturday night. They found a high top for us with no problem. Within minutes we had drinks and our order was taken. Service and support staff was A ! sushi came out fast! Top sushi experience of mine. Thanks Yellowtail! The tuna pizza was to die for. The protein roll amazing.,2
Food is kinda tired but not as tired as the people that work there. nEveryone who works here has soo much attitude its beyond belief. 1. Get over yourself n2. The pho is horrible n3. Horrible Horrible music Life is too short to be rude all the time. I actually stopped going there because everyone who works there is sooo rude all I order is takeout.,1
Famous Dave's service has always been one of my favorites. They are always super positive and smiling ear to ear. It looks like a fun place to work as well. My favorite thing is the Dave's Burger or the Pulled Chicken Sandwich Memphis style! Go on an empty stomach because the food is so filling but so so good.,2
They serve up some huge portions but does it help that it's huge portions of very mediocre food. I think this place is popular just due to their oversized portions and interesting plating but not so much on the actual tastiness of their food. The chicken and waffles were probably my favorite dish that I tried.,1
Stayed here last week and it was a very nice hotel. I really liked the architecture. My room was very good. Used the meeting and conference facilities while here and they were very good as well. Really liked the service at the fire pits at night when I was allowed to bring my own wine down to drink it with friends. Lunch at the pool was very good. I would stay here again.,2
"One star is generous. Too bad I will still go here because it's close. Happy Harry's was hands down better than these clowns. After you see the job they do you'll feel like you got raped, with no lube, by the salesman issuing wash tickets. I'd tell ya to go somewhere else but up here there just ain't nowhere else to go.",1
"This IS the place I've been dreaming about. Stumble upon this place a year ago and have been thinking of the food since. Every time I get to Phoenix, this is the one must stop. Everything is good, but I recommend getting your enchilada Christmas style both red and green sauce ! nGreat value, great food and great service.",2
"As a vegetarian I was really excited about the food here! I got the Tempura Avocado Bahn Mi Tacos, as well as black bean dip as an appetizer. The tacos were delicious but missing a little something. Put the black bean dip into them and OMG even better. Really impressed, and my mouth's watering just thinking about it! Hope to return soon ",2
I love this place. I found it today and had a one on one lesson in crochet. Chris was so patient and kind. I left with some great new tools to help me stay on track and a boost of needed confidence. This place is so awesome. They have crochet and knitting circle meetings on Wednesday nights at 6pm. I can't wait to try it out. Thank you Chris. I am so excited about my new project.,2
"Delightful! Been a customer for over a year now.happened to notice it by chance driving by. Tried 60 of items on the menu, and there are a lot. Live close by and so when jogging or cycling through the neighborhood, LOVE that I can just stop by here and get a freshly made juice and not have to go home and deal with my own juicer ",2
"If you want to remember junior high style cafeteria food then this is the place to be. Cardboard pizza and burgers, taco meat that smells like armpits, and egg rolls filled with rice. ""eeks methink not "" is right. nThere is a reason it is 6.99 for lunch, there is so much salt and artery blockers, that you will need to save money for the hospital visit.",1
"I ate lunch here yesterday or stated to and realized pretty quickly that the pork chunks in my dish were raw in the middle. I alerted my waiter, who argued with me that the pork could not possibly be raw due to the fact that it was deep fried. Did not finish, not going back. Trichinosis? I'll letcha know.",1
Had poppa Naps cater my dads 50th birthday when we went to Las Vegas from California. Absolutely amazing! We eat a lot of barbeque in California and the food that was prepared was some of the best bbq I have ever had. everyone loved it and would recommend poppa naps to anyone looking for just good food!,2
WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS HERE AGAIN! I was told that if I had any issues with my toner it would be exchanged NOT the case. nThe owner Goldstein was VERY rude to my stepdad grabbing the toner and phone from his hands! Look elsewhere or simply buy the products from the store as I have had issues with their toners in the past as well.,1
"Accomodated our 16 person party with ease. nI was truly impressed with the quality and portion size. A real value for money. I also think the waitstaff is spot on wasn't hovering like a comic book villain, but didn't ignore me either.not easy to do in a huge party. Will be back the next time in the North Las V area. WOOT",2
"I work in downtown central Phoenix and I've been going to Focaccia every morning for their french toast. It is delicious, and apparently addictive. Beware! The french toast comes with bacon or ham and a couple pieces of fruit for 5.25, which I consider a fair deal. I've also had their pizzas and they're very good as well.",2
"Apparently, I managed to visit this place at one of the few times it's not completely packed. Which was awesome for me because the 4 cheese omelette I ordered was insanely delicious. The waitress was super nice and the atmosphere was very relaxed. I will definitely be making a visit the next time I'm in town.",2
"Dr. Lieber is very professional and he is very knowledgeable. Appointments are usually easy to make and there is usually not much waiting in the office. My only complaint is that he won't renew prescriptions for a long enough period, so I have to come back to the office more often than I would prefer.",2
"The pizza here is just so so. They claim to have excellent New York style pizza that rivals the East coast, but they fall far far FAR short of that mark. We tried the carne and the meatball. Both were alright. Nothing spectacular. If the pizza were cheaper and if they weren't making such huge claims, I probably would have tacked on another star.",1
"Pros Gym is close to my home and is in a nice area. Lots of cardio equipment, treadmills, etc. CONS Trainers will interupt you during your workouts trying to get you to sign up with them. They also call A LOT.got two phone calls yesterday alone from two different trainers. Gonna cancel my membership tomorrow.",1
well. everything might have changed here but one thing remains the same my food was just as cold as it was every time i went to palette. i'll probably be back i gave palette six tries before i realized NOTHING was going to make my food hot. but what the f ? get some warmers or something. this is silly.,1
"The service was friendly and professional. Very good price for a Rio French so close to a full, I don't think I'll switch back! Best thing is that she trimmed me up before waxing. The only complaint was that I couldn't tell if the linens were just stained or used. She put a towel over the area I was laying, but still left me wondering.",2
"Forget this place, we came in at 2 45pm. They state that their restaurant closed at 3pm, but they kicked us out for no reason. No respect and they give no customer value. Change your damn closing time if you won't even work up to it. Pathetic. Thank god we didn't even go there. Their sushi sucks. Worst sushi in Vegas honestly.",1
"Took forever to get our order in. Had to retake our order after 20 minutes of waiting. Then our order was messed up again. Looks like only one person working the front. All in all, it took the server 4 tries to get our order right. No one at the table got their food at the same time so we ended up waiting even longer for everyone to finish. Service sucked. Food was average.",1
"This was a terrific find this past weekend in Montreal. nThe arugula salad was delicious, as was the salmon tartare and seared duck appetizers. Excellent wine and a perfect martini made exactly as ordered. nOur server was very attentive and always happily smiling even though obviously busy. nIt was in a fun, active part of town as well. nI would highly recommend this restaurant.",2
"In retrospect, I wish we'd just bought a few cans in the shop and drank them on the train. It was full of wasted folk who I suspect weren't waiting on trains, was reasonably dingy, and was just generally the kind of place where you drink up quickly because you just want to get away from the clientele.",1
"Came here on a recomendation. Food isn't bad unless you are expecting authentic Cajun food. Jambalaya had a layer of oil floating, the fried catfish was overcooked and thin. Overall disappointing. nReminds me a little of the tryouts on American Idol where the people think they can sing but they can't. nDon't get me wrong, the food is ok, but this is hardly fresh and authentic.",1
Good ole southern food n MOST of the staff is awesome its like seeing an old friend with a famaliar face. great cakes and pies and the chicken is what I live for.! Merts has an amazing down home southerm charm feeling. it can drown out all the excitement of center city with its cool southern down home meets the city vibe. dones sometimes smell like grease but I still love it!,2
"I had the ribs at 11 00. They looked nothing like the picture. Were average at best. Worst than that was the service. I sat for 10 minutes before the waitress ever came for a drink order. Then, after she brought the food, she never came back until 10 minutes later. to drop off the bill. Didn't ask if I need anything else. Didn't even come back to collect. The place is a dump, too.",1
"Hello, I got into a car accident this past summer and Dr. Mike and his crew really helped me out a lot. I was referred to them by some friends and I was surprised at the rehab they do along with the awesome Chiropratic work. All the doctors and staff know what they are doing. The office is always clean and a really nice place. Try them you will be happy, I was.",2
"When the Gelato is actually made and served by a real Italian, it just tastes better. This stuff is the real deal. I would say that when I go there I feel that I'm transported to Venice and that I'm eating the Gelato in the home country, but that would be an exaggeration. It's still darn good even though I'm stuck in Scottsdale. Ciao.",2
"On Friday the ""Friends of the Orphans "" sponsored a fundraiser dinner here.Everyone really enjoyed themselves the food and wine were great Zoran, Chris, Tim and Taber were more than accomodating all enjoyed the various pastas, fried calamari with a great variety of sauces , and fish. Also, on weekends there is life music, which makes for great atmosphere.",2
"First time at this 24. This place is falling apart. The steam room smells like piss. The sauna is dark and creepy with the boards in the ceiling falling out. Doesn't seem like it's been cleaned or anyone's given a sh t about this gym in a while. For shame 24 hour fitness. Also. In California this would be considered a super sport, what the point of a wet area if you don't offer a towel service?",1
Baked Potatoes are saving me from an early fast food grave. Mr Hot Potato have more fillings than you can imagine some extremely questionable. pineapple? but rest assured you'll be catered for however you like it. As Stephanie says it rarely costs you more than a fiver for a good wholesome meal that won't leave you bloated or hungry!,2
"This LV is still the best stocked LV I've been to. The last time I was here, I came with my family and they were waiting to use the restroom. One of the male employee came and told them they couldn't wait there and stood by them until they moved from the area. He acted like they were about to steal something. It was totally unprofessional.",1
I went to Pita Pit after a night out at the bars and I was very impressed. Bert the guy behind the counter made me a Philly Cheese Steak pita and it was incredible. He put southwestern sauce and jalapeno peppers on it. It was my first time at a Pita Pit and I am slightly upset there is not one on Long Island. nNext time I visit WVU I will have to pay Bert a visit.,2
"I've always been happy with my meals over at AZ '88. They have an interesting take on sandwiches and blend in spicy wing sauce with a few of their dishes, so that's worth atleast two stars by itself. The decor is creative and unorthodox, but charming in the Bird Cage sort of way. It is great for lunch, and a fun spot to people watch and drink cocktails after work.",2
"Seems like people who use the butcher shop rave about the place. Perhaps there is a disconnect between the level of quality on the butcher shop side and the restaurant side. One of the more difficult to eat cuts of Prime Rib I've had in a while. For a place that is supposed to specialize in meats, I guess you'd expect more.",1
"I had an issue ordering over the phone and the lady having a very poor attitude. My Inlaw went to pick up the food and waited forever, the order was my near ready. And the lady had forgotten most my order. She also had a very rude attitude while dealing with customers. I wrote the store and still have not got a resolution. Needless to say I have not returned.",1
"The service was top notch. nThe manager and several wait staff came by to say hello and to see if we were enjoying our food. nWe got 8 oz filet special for the grown ups and burger for the kids filet was a little under cooked asked for medium rare but it was more rare but still good. They didn't have regular fries, it was potato wedges which didn't work out for the kids.",2
"Total lack of staffing you can walk all over this store and not find an employee. Its dirty, disorganized, and most the time you are left to having to use self checkout, the have virtually no carts or trollys. To top that off you get accosted by illegal immigrants as drive in to the parking lot and while leaving.",1
"Now called ""Fleur "" and a casual tapas menu. It is absolutely delicious. My recommendations would be ahi tuna tacos, skirt steak, mac n cheese and the mussels were my favorite. You can also order anything off the dessert menu, they are all incredible. Keller was very nice and came to our table to say hello and take a photo.",2
"Unimpressed. Met a friend for drinks and ate from the bar menu. She said her burger was super salty and the homemade chips were stale. My tavern steak was a lot of gristle, although the sauce and saut u00e9ed spinach and nmushrooms were good. The prices were good 6 for each , but if you're using low quality or leftover ingredients, what's the point?",1
"The restaurant is kinda hidden in the plaza on Dobson and Guadalupe. The place is small but clean. Service was good and we didn't have to wait to long for the food. We ordered some Gogi, spicy chicken, tofu soup and some Korean street tacos. Everything tasted delicious and the portions were generous. I highly recommend the Korean street tacos!",2
"This place is simply good food at a great price. I love their authentic chicken tacos and the salsa is wonderful, but some of their other dishes are just OK. The atmostphere is nothing special and they don't serve alcohol, so don't expect a whole lot more than a good meal and some awesome chips and salsa.",2
"This is a newer IHoP, so you would think it'd be a nicer one. It isn't. This location is close to my house, but my daughter and I drive all the way to Power and Baseline because it's so much better than this one. Every time we come to this location the tables are icky and there are always flies. In fact, my daughter and I call this location FLYHOP.",1
"i'm not in love with this chain, and this location in particular is pretty bad. nusually dried up or slightly brown lettuce, dirty floors, etc. when you go out specifially for fresh salads, it's just the last thing you want to be surrounded by, i guess. ni lived in an apartment in the same complex as this one for a year and literally went there one time.",1
"I LOVE coffee and try places all over. I really, really wanted to like this place. The coffee is average. The pastries are average but expensive for what you get americano is 4, muffin 3 . The wi fi is ok but don't expect to stream music. It often cuts out. The air conditioning is set at a high temp so if you like it cool, this is not the place for you.",1
love this Italian bistro! my fav. i would have giving 5 stars for dinner you need sometime. well about 2 hours. so do go here for a quick bit because you will be there for ever. but for an evening out this is the place for you the best Italian food comes to the table hot hot hot! i can't ever get enough!,2
"I usually love Benihana, and this one is really nice asthetically, but my entire party became ill after eating here. The only thing we all had was fried rice, so we suspect chicken that wasn't quite right. The service was good, but to pay over 300 for a meal and get sick from it is just wrong there were 5 of us .",1
"3 stars for the food n1 more star for the love at the register Ordered the 1 and 3 gyro fries and drink, steak gyro fries and drink nA couple pieces of the steak were chewy, jaw sore chewy. But it was loaded with steak so no complaints for only 2 off pieces. Spent a couple pennies under 20 for the 2 combos and a pea cup of hummus and a pita for the toddler.",2
"This is a truly terrible distributor. The staff always seems incredibly inconvenienced to help you, the service is curt, the prices are higher than anywhere around, and the only time you can get a cold case seems to be in the winter when they leave the garage doors open and use mother natures refrigerator. Avoid this place, there is a much better distributor on 10th street.",1
"I was looking for that Pittsburgh experience. Pirates game and a Primanti Brothers sandwich. The Pirates got shut out and my sandwich left me disappointing as well. I KNOW ballpark food is overpriced and not the same. I get the gimmick that the sandwich is stuffed with coleslaw and fries. Interesting and worth a try, but not something I will try again. Next time I will get a sausage or brisket.",1
"Disgusting! I would rather stay in a Motel 6 then stay in this casino. First off the staff were really rude and unprofessional, second the rooms look like they're from the 60's with stained carpets and grimed wallpaper, and last but not least the entire casino smelt like a convalescent home even ion smoking sections. I will never step foot in this place again and recommend you don't either",1
Just okay. Often crowded on weekends for food that while I'm sure well prepared is not the most flavorful. This store is literally NEXT DOOR to the headquarters of Eat N Park so it's a safe bet that this is the best one there is. Strawberry pies being the exception to the rule. There are better places to eat for the same money.,1
"The food is good with big portion compared to the money paid for it. However, the service quality is not that great. When I bought take away or ask for delivering for lunch combination, frequently there were missing things in the portion ex fork spoon missing, no soup . I am just curious how can this place still in business with its terrible service.",1
"I love Freeds. They did my wedding cake and Baby shower cake. Although they got the color sceem incorrect on the wedding cake, it tasted and looked amazing. I explained to them the mistake and they apologized and gave me a discount on my baby shower cake. It was amazing as well. They are always friendly. Whenever a staff member has a Birthday i pick up a cake from Freeds! Its worth trying!",2
This is for sure one of the best breakfast spots in town! They are always slammed with customers and are at a great location in Scottsdale! There food selection is good and their food is always fresh! Their orange juice is freshly squeezed as well. If you are hungry for breakfast this is the place to go! Love it!,2
I was so excited to hear about this place since they claim to make popcorn as good as Garrett's. I LOVE popcorn from Chicago.cheese and carmel mixed together is my favorite. I drove across town to try this and was disappointed because it doesn't even compare. I'll stick to ordering online or wait until I'm in Chicago to get the real stuff.,1
"Loved it! I'm normally very afraid of heights but this was so inviting and since I was doing it with friends I thought 'What the heck! "" and I went for it screaming ""Yahoooooo "" all the way down the slides! n nIt was a little cold out so I didn't do the wreaking balls. I was already soaking wet. Still yet, I loved it and it was super fun.",2
"This is an awesome park! It is huge and it has great areas to grill and hang out. It also has a great dog park! Lots of people and lots of things to see and enjoy. The skatepark is a decent size and brings all walks of people. If you are looking to bar b que, take your dog for an adventure, skate, chill out, or just people watch this is a great park to come to!",2
"This place so completely failed to make an impression on me that I almost forgot we were here. We stopped in for something to drink on a HOT Las Vegas afternoon. We sat at the bar and ordered two Absolute and Cranberries. Our Bill was 30.00! That's high even for Vegas. In my younger days, the very attractive staff might have been enough to draw me back here, but not anymore.",1
"Was told this was really authentic Chinese food. I'm not judge of oriental authenticity. but I can tell you I did not enjoy the food. Lots of grissle and fat. Kind of gross. The sauces were a little bland. My ex bought a copy of Legend of Zelda with the gold cartridge from this place, though. Tell me that that's something you look for in a Chinese food restaurant.",1
"Great place to grab a quick, cheap lunch in a laid back environment. The 5 Burger Box comes with three toppings cheese, bacon, avocado, red onion, to name a few and a side of fries. I like the sweet potato fries. The bar staff are friendly and attentive and I always here the most random statements from day drinking patrons.",2
"About 40 of games broken, this location used to be fuow u gamble when u put a quarter in any machine. Good luck. If it was not for my daughter I would never set foot inside this place. I would rather pay 20 dollars for games at Peter Pipper and atleast ALL the game will work. Thumbs down. I guess the creator of Chucky Cheese does not care if its franchise drowns.",1
Ichiban is up there with the best Chinese in Madison. Most of the menu is authentic with a few American standards thrown in. Think General Tso's chicken. It's best to come with a few adventurous friends and order several items. The portions are huge for the prices. String beans with or without minced pork and cumin lamb are my faves. I will be back. Soon.,2
"WOW. Went there for the first time Friday. Thought it was good until today when my friend sees they added 20 onto his tab. Tipped the tender each time a drink was purchased. He has all the receipts and it was way less than what they charged him. So if you enjoy being robbed, this is the place for you! NEVER returning.",1
"This place is the pinnacle of what makes a great pub instead of using their recent refurbishment to make it young trendy, they kept the traditional style and just cleaned it up a bit. Friendly landlord and locals, an impressive range of guest ales, and a decent beer garden to soak up the rays on a sunny day admittedly something as rare as a beer garden itself in Scotland .",2
"Tried giving the local coffee shop some business over the Starbucks near by. Cozy place not very friendly, all I can say is that my almost 7 triple latte was served warm at best with 2 shots at the most. I struggle with the price for such a poorly made product. Haven't been back since although I hear their liquor filled chocolates are great.",1
"I give this review a total 1 star If I was able to, I would have rated no stars at all!. I would NEVER reccomend ANYONE to live here. The office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year I lived there based on THEIR MISTAKES! I caot express how disappointed I am with the way that they have treated me.",1
"My favorite things I've had at Heritage are the roasted beet salad and the ""don't call me Alexander "" ice cream dessert. The salad was seriously amazing. The macadamia nuts and the dark chocolate play off the tart beets very well. The ice cream was boozy and delicious. I'd come back for either of these any day.",2
"I have to say that I'm pretty fond of this place! There was a smoothie shop that I enjoyed going to when I was a kid but that was closed down several years ago and I could NOT find anything like it, but I did. and it's called INTA JUICE! and its 10 times better than Tropical Smoothie Cafe and Jamba Juice! I recommend the Strawberry Blast !",2
"I understood that this show was an 'adult' show, however, it was nothing more than unexplainable breasts. I do not consider myself a prude at all, but I found the show off putting. I do not think I knew what I was getting myself into. This show is not the Cirque performance that I was expecting. I really wouldn't recommend this show to anyone.",1
Went here with a friend last week to see what its all about. Was good sushi but was limited in the spicy department. I was a little disappointed that they didnt have some spicier options. Overall was good and I loved the bartender. She was a realy great host and made sure we got all the specials. I will go again!,2
"Que Mas is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Friendly, efficient service and delicious food. Love their salsa and chips. My husband usually orders enchilada plate with pot beans instead of refried beans. And I love their steak tacos with avocado. Great food generous portions. Good service and descent prices.",2
"I'll give a more extensive update after, but.the Sandwich tip worked again! 20 between the Driver's License and the credit card when you hand it over to the Front Desk clerk and ask for an upgrade and Voila!.they upgrade my room that was already comped. So far has worked every time. Very nice room that includes a huge bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub, shower, and double sink. More later.",2
"Great movie screens and a generous facility with state of the art digital screens make this the place to go for those big budget visual spectaculars. The snack bar and popcorn are above average, tho I wish were a bit better to match the quality of the facility. You will need to walk a bit as the theatre is set in the middle of an outdoor mall meant to replicate a small neighborhood.",2
"Ordered pasta and salad and the salad didn't make it to me. When I called back in the ""chief "" got on the phone to tell me I was a ""lying "". I was shocked! He finally said he would send my salad back. and an hour later I called back to check on my salad. I was told ""if "" they got a driver free they would send it. Absolutely the worst customer service ever!",1
"We just got a couple cherry dipped ice cream cones and they were almost white we thought they just didn't dip them good enough because most of the employees don't, but this time it was like eating wax. This Dairy Queen is BAD and even the stuff the managers make are terrible. Find a better location or place to go!",1
"The Rivers is a great spot downtown to play some slots or table games! They have non smoking sections, a wide variety of machines, beverage service, great buffets with a ton of freshly made cuisines and free parking. Everything is incredibly clean, too! The machines are usually pretty tight but it's still fun to go!",2
"Just what the neighborhood needed A family restaurant open long hours with a real bar and a nice patio. Breakfast menu features a nice selection of omeletes and pancakes among other things. It's served until 4PM. The coffee is very good. It's not cheap, but you tend to get what you pay for. No real downside perceived here. I'll be back.",2
"Great atmosphere, superb service, and GOOOOOD FOOOD! I usually expect the healthy choice in any restaurant to be a compromise. Not at Green Dacha! I ordered the chicken breast plate, and honestly this was the best I've ever had it prepared even the rice was seasoned and tasty as is and needed absolutely no condiments or sauce! Will definitely come back to try the breakfast.",2
"This place is our absolute favorite breakfast place in Madison. Good, healthy, yummy breakfasts! Kids menu is very reasonable and has great stuff for them. Because of the Farmer's Market on the capitol square mid April through November , this place is VERY busy on Saturday mornings, so arrive before 8 00 AM or expect to wait in line to order.",2
"Apparently the same people who own Zipps, own Goldie's as well. I went here with a date and we had burgers and beer how can you go wrong?! I liked the layout and was impressed it had 3 huge screens on one side and an upstairs with shuffle board and pool tables. The food was good and portions were huge.",2
"Service was very slow, had specials on a board but couldn't get them because they aren't available on weekends which isn't listed, asked for creamer for coffee took 15 mins to get it, food was salty, no butter for toast. Got 3 full pieces of toast and only 1 grape and 1 strawberry jelly, this place is a joke if you want to eat here! Don't do it!",1
"We came here for a late night post show dinner recently. We were seated promptly after arrival. Though the restaurant was crowded when we arrived, it had mostly cleared out by the time we left. Lots of wine choices and a helpful sommelier we enjoyed a California Chardonnay and a California Pinot Noir . The lobster role appetizer was outstanding. The mixed grill was artfully presented.",2
"Filly Bs. I LOVE this place. This location is particularly good. I love their taco tuedays, something about their chicken tacos is just good. I love their carne asada tacos, chicken tacos, and their bean burritos. If you want cheap, big portions of good Mexican food, Filly Bs is it. It's not by any means fine dining or a ""restaurant "", but it's a good quick stop place.",2
I was NOT a fan of this place. At 1st I thought hey cool place but quickly changed my mind. The bowling sucks because you have to pay for the hour and then you get kicked off your lane. The drinks were terrible I guess the waitress said something was wrong with the lines. Nope nope not coming back here. Waste of money.,1
"Great place for Dim Sum. Food quality was great and they had plenty of items to choose from. We had large party of 25 people and they were able to meet our accommodations quickly. Food service was great, the cart ladies were constantly making their rounds and they made sure our tummies were full. We definitely did not miss out a thing!",2
"Ate here with my parents while visiting them last week. I have had authentic Chinese and fast food Chinese. This was neither. It was just incredibly greasy, poorly prepared food. The only dish that was decent was the pork fried rice. Pretty tough to really mess this up but surprised they didn't! nFood served quickly. Then service disappeared. Strange place. Never again.",1
"Great ambiance. Love the colorful artwork. Started out with the guacamole.it was delicious. I've never had guac with oranges in it, which may not sound that appealing, but it's awesome. The fish tacos were great too. They look small, but two were enough to fill me up. They pack a lot of fish into those little tacos. Great flavors and love the hot salsa.",2
The people that work here are lame. Don't accidentally rip a barcode. They aren't smart enough to type in the numbers for the code or at least know how much a product costs to manually type in the price. It was annoying. A lot of items needed to be restocked. Fine array of sandwiches though.didn't eat one. Never returning to this one again.,1
If I could leave less of a star I would. Wasted so much time in lines. They were completely inaccurate in assumptions of line times. When told 45 minutes it was more like 2 hours. There were far more people coming out then they were taking in due to the incompetence on the computer. The manager at the buffet at ceasars needs to be fired for her attitude. Don't waste your money!,1
"This is hands down one of my favorite places! If you love homemade pasta and good quality authentic Italian food than Evo is for you. Servers are awesome not to mention the owner Nick coming up and introducing himself to everyone., super friendly and inviting staff. Atmosphere is trendy and intimate. Grapefruit basil martinis are a must too! Def worth checking out!",2
The Luxor was nice however their service was the worst I've ever had. We called several times for towels and other essentials we needed and they finally brought them up after 2 hours the lady had an attitude. We also requested room service while we were gone and that never happened. I was very disappointed with them.,1
Ive never been a huge fan of this place. Buffalo Wild Wings is good for one thing. their wings. However I was pretty disappointed in the wings this time. Im a dry rub person when they are available. Tasted like their wings were cooked way too long. So they were not great. Best Buffalo Wild Wings was the one of Scottsdale 101. but they closed and are another sports bar.,1
"Not worth it! nI wasn't expecting to have to fork over so much cash. Luckily we had half priced tickets. If we ended up paying the full 12 just to get in the doors then pay an outrageous amount at each of the vendors, I would have been even more upset. The only plus was, I had some amazing tacos. But, that's it. We will definitely not be going next year.",1
"I tried this place for the first time last week. Went there for their prime rib special. All I gotta say is WOW! Their prime rib is cooked to perfection. Medium rare, just to my liking. The meal also comes with a side of veggies and potatoes and all you can eat salad bar, which is somewhat decent, and also comes with a cherries jubilee dessert. Great bang for your buck!",2
"Wish I could give them 0 star. Reserved and paid online, waited for 1 hour to pick my car! I've been rent cars with budget for several years, but this Vegas site is the woooorst one I have ever experienced. My device is, don't rent with them, turn to some one else unless you want to wait endless like a dumbass in their line.",1
Love the store they have very competitive prices on their organic products except for their apples! They do need to try and expand their organic produce more even though they've come a long way . I really think I would give them a 4 or 5 stars if it wasn't for their employees! They have Some of the rudest people I've ever come across working at check out.,1
I'm so glad that there is a new location by this area! Cafe rio is a great Mexican restaurant at a pretty reasonable price. This is not an authentic Mexican restaurant but the food is still delicious. They are well known for their sweet pork and their enchilada style burrito. I would recommend to try the salad or the burrito although you won't be disappointed with anything you order here,2
We called to confirm price AND went online for estimates. The dispatcher told us it would be less than 15. We got to our destination the clock said 10.50 but they said they had to charge us an additional 12! He blamed it on a new dispatcher. Sorry that is not our problem. We will choose another company next time.,1
"As usual.the Yelpers led me in the right direction. We needed carpet at the last minute for a remodel which is no small task during Christmas week. Gave TLC a call on 12 26 and Ramin had an in stock carpet ready to go out the door for a very fair price. He was helpful, friendly and efficient.all the things I needed during this stressful job. Thanks Ramin. I will send everyone I know your way.",2
"This place is great. There are enough reviews on here that go over the concept and the process of making a good Mongolian bowl. Best advice 1. Pack your bowl with your fist 2. Use at least 5 scoops of sauce 3. Don't forget that there is rice, soup and ice cream still waiting for you after you get your bowl cooked.",2
"I'm giving this place four stars, let me explain why. My family thinks it was a five star place, but, to be honest, the wings definitely didn't impress me, and the buffalo chicken sandwhich was acceptional, but not outstanding. The service was absolutely outstanding! The price is well worth it! Definitely a place to check out!",2
"What's with the rave about their tortillas? I get it. They're thin, fresh and comes out the foil steaming, but what's so special about them? The original was tasteless for obvious reasons . The butter tortilla was just you know.the original slathered in butter. Most of the food is just carb overload. The machaca breakfast burrito was pure MUSH.",1
"It's not even freakin busy in here and it's been 10 minutes before they even started making my order. Some chick is just mopin'around not anything I wanted chipotle but came here to be quicker, well the long ass line That was at chipotle was done before they even started making my order that's bullshit I'm not coming here ever again",1
Food great. Service great. Live Music AMAZING! nWe attended brunch this past Sunday for the first time. Everything was great from the food to the beverages. What made this brunch special was the live musician they had. The young man had a very John Mayer ish vibe and the volume was perfect. Hope to be back soon to enjoy the whole experience!,2
"Walked in to place a to go order. Lady told us to have seat and she'll be with us soon. Another family comes in, does the same. Then about 5 more people come and she took all their orders without acknowledging us so we left after 10 mins, they didn't eveotice us walk out. Might try again another night but not anytime soon.",1
"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. After reading so many reviews, I was having a high hope to find another good Japanese restaurant in Madison. Sadly the food is very bland, the sushi is not fresh at all. We ordered sushi for two and you can see some of the meat are cooked due to microwave defrosting.",1
"Horrible customer service the guy getting our cab RANDY was a duch u00e9 bag he wasnt considerate of peoples mood he just immediately judged and gave EXTREME ATTITUDE. WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF RANDY. Thanks VDARA glad I stayed here. Suggestion, get rid of your horrible terrible employees such as RANDY getting people cabs. Not a very informed guy.",1
"Eaten here numerous times. Had take out numerous times too. Always yummy Middle Eastern food. The owners are very nice. My experience has always been positive with the service. nIf you go on a day when they have freshly made couscous, do try it it's very delicious! So flavorful! nAlso their Chicken Fatoush Salad is mmmmmm!",2
"Maybe I'm not a ramen expert but this place does it for me. Good prices, nice casual atmosphere, friendly staff, great T shirts, great bowl of soup with many options. The standard bowl, 7.50, is a fine meal anytime. Just make sure you get there by 10 30 p.m. even though they are open until 11, they stop taking orders at 10 30.",2
"Buffet only review. Horrible food. Really dreadful. It gets 2 stars because the place was acceptably clean, and it was cheap. The casino is similar to other Station casinos around town, but parking and way finding here is not quite as good as Fiesta or Texas Stations, which are similarly suburban locations.",1
"Wow. Just wow. I really can't believe all the great reviews for this place. It's pretty run down compared to similar places anywhere else I've been. Even small towns. Maybe if you've only lived in Vegas, you might think this is super duper cool because it very well might be the best there is. I'm not impressed. Not at all.",1
"Danny the sales associate is so friendly. We use Legend Cleaners weekly for our business attire. Always comes back clean, crisp and looking sharp. Very affordable and prompt. Takes a day or two for cloths to come back, but if we ever need a quick turn around they are always willing to do it, just ask. Great cleaners!",2
"Was at the alteration place next door waiting for a friend and needed a snack. I ordered a appetizer order of shrimp tempura. Yuck, the shrimp tasted like it just came out of the freezer, and these were sliced in half so it was half a shrimp. There was too much batter which made up for the size, but seriously, that doesn't count. I would not come back, ever.",1
One of the absolute best Mexican restaurants that I've been to in the U.S. Simply amazing. Very small and quaint atmosphere. The prices were awesome and very affordable. I enjoyed the authentic Mexican beer and their beans and burritos were one of a kind. As soon as you step out of the restaurant you have an awesome view of camelback mountain.,2
Filiberto food with high restaurant prices. Tried it once before and thought maybe I got something bad. But I was wrong. This is just average mexican good posing as fine food. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Mexican food. I would recommend restaurant Mexico on mill if you want great Mexican food that doesn't try to church up it's prices,1
I've been coming here since it was called Papa Chuys it was changed because Chuys sued them for the name . The food has always been consistently good. It is hard finding a breakfast burrito any better. The carne asada is just as good and the tortillas are soft. The place is always busy. That has to say something!,2
"Pretty cool.didn't go in the water for fear of getting several unknown diseases. Drinks are ridiculous but that's what you can expect. 80 bucks for 8 beers. No joke. Nowhere to sit, if you don't want to be shoulder to shoulder in the disgusting pool, and don't want to stand and dance all day, then get a cabana or an umbrella.if you've got the !",2
I love. love. Spak. The only reason why I'm not obese and broke is because Spak doesn't deliver or else I'd order their food. every. day. nI love their sandwiches and sweet potato fries. I don't think I ordered anything that I didn't like here. Couldn't go wrong with Spak. nThe food is pretty fast and the staff there is friendly enough as well.,2
"WOWZERS! This truck was parked in front of the State Capitol downtown Phoenix where i work and MY OH MY! iI had the gangsta Grilled Cheese Sandwich which was pretty gangsta! Brisket, melted cheese, and mac and cheese on sourdough bread. I didn't want the sandwich to end it was SO good. Highly recommend Q Up. Service was fast and SUPER friendly. Thank you!",2
"Mickey's is always packed with the worst people in town. It smells. It's loud in a bad way think a constant stream of brospeak. I gave it an extra star just because they serve beer hey, I'm easy to please but then took it away because they serve Schlitz in a can. That was a lot cooler when I was 21 and broke, now I just find it in poor form.",1
This place is awesome! This was my first time here and the food is grub! Sandwiches here are huge and is less than 8.00. best bang for your buck!. Be warned that these are no average subway sandwiches. These will feed you lunch and dinner. I got the beef and italian sausage sandwich which was really heavy and delicious. Good Stuff!.,2
"I discovered this place about 3 years ago and I've been coming back ever since. I love the little old man who is usually there to take your order, he is so happy and positive, and because of that I always leave a tip. I eat in and take out often. My favorite is the teriyaki chicken and house rice! The house rice is the best I've ever had, I don't know what they do, but it's amazing!",2
Unfortunately this show was awful. We thought our pet crazed 11 year old would love it but even he was rolling his eyes. Besides being extremely corny which I expected there were many tricks that did not even work. The audio was pre taped and it was like watching a Godzilla movie with bad dubbing. Don't waste a dime to see this ridiculous show.,1
"Since I found Great Wall 35th and Camelback and Little Saigon 58th and Glendale I don't like Panda Express. Plus my favorite SweetFire Chicken Breast is nothing but fried dough and not much chicken in it. If you want to spent 7 9 I'd rather want to eat dim sum at Great Wall or Pho noodle at Little Saigon, it worth to drive there.",1
I'm not certain how this place will stay in business.maybe the hotels around it will help. We've given Marie's 3 chances each time I went there was a laundry list of items that they were out of or their 'pie guy' didn't show up to make the pies. Prices a bit expensive for very bland food. I had high hopes for this place.,1
My Merlot was decent but the calamari was not. The calamari while had hints of Italian seasoning was bland and became soggy of the cooked vegetables that they had underneath it. Plus I think I found a fry or two with the vegetables. Also Lot 17 had some funky smells throughout the time that we were there. Service could have been better. I might return for drinks but only drinks.,1
"Food is good and service has gotten better. I feel bad that they don't have more business. They have the 2, 4, 6 menu item.what could be better than that? All you can eat pancakes for 4. Yum! Give it a try. I don't think you will be disappointed.but then everyone has their own opinion. Kids eat free on Tuesday and Thursday I think, call to verify ",2
"I absolutely love this gym, since the new management took over this gym has become so much better. Trainers are ALL Awesome, they help you on the proper technique. The change has been very good. The workouts are so much better and seeing results faster then I was before. Would recommend this gym to everyone",2
"My friend and I just went in, asked for cocktail menus, and then sat for 20 minutes trying to get the bartenders attention to take our orde.r, while he immediately took the orders of groups of men who .walked up to the bar. It wasn't even crowded and it was completely futile to get a drink in there. Needless to say we walked out drinkless.",1
"the tea is nicely priced and is to die for. although the food is a bit pricy, it is well worth it. basically, everything that you get there WILL taste like love. and you'll leave pleased with yourself. the staff is also very nice and very attentive. i would recommend trying one of the chai teas. they are fantastic.",2
"Everything is wonderful at Amelie's. When I take people on the 30 minute journey to get there they complain about the distance. As soon as they take their first bite, they never complain again. I always get a salted caramel brownie. My boyfriend loves the petite gateaus. I have also had their sandwiches. They are awesome, too.",2
"Odd Design, low ceilings in casino and hallways result in an overall uncomfortable feeling. Seems like 20 designers worked on this property who were not communicating with each other. Feels like an upscale version of a ""thrift shop "". nBed was directly underneath window with decent view which resulted in staring at the door when in bed. nTo sum it up very odd !",1
"My visiting daughter from Montana took us here following a hike up Echo Canyon at Camelback Mtn. We were completely impressed. Had the cubano panini and it was delicious! Very hipster location with a nostalgic candy section, interesting books ala Urban Outfitters, and wonderful freshly squeezed lemonade. We'll definitely be back! Great value and incredible food.",2
"This place was excellent! It was very, very busy, but they got us to a table quickly. Our waiter despite the noise and crowd, there were a lot of people there was incredible. So attentive and accommodating. Warm and relaxed ambience. Beautifully decorated. It's not cheap but it is reasonable and it's well worth the quality of food and service you receive. Love this place",2
"Truly an underwhelming experience, especially given the standards of quality at the Wynn. Food was unoriginal and bland. Service was MIA. Despite making reservation well and advance, was seated at the first table in the restaurant. Lesson? Dont make early reservations, or specifically request a good table. Better yet, skip the reservations altogether and enjoy Aquanox.",1
I found the Trump Hotel in Vegas rather unusual but in a good way. Its the only large Hotel without a Casino and completely smoke free. Service was impeccable and I was there during CES 2011 which is a complete mad house for Vegas. I didn't venture to the pool bar area but will next time I stay there.,2
Incredible tequila selection! The food is consistantly very very good. Service is always attentive. Both the mild and hot salsa are two of my favorites but I'd suggest asking for some of the freshly made pico de gallo. This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. The shredded beef tacos are very good but the machaca are even better.,2
"The atmosphere is nice with romantic lighting and live music. Service is helpful and considerate. But the food is mediocre at best the short rib is as dry as beef jerky, sea bass is dry and flavorless as well. And the price is much higher than we expected 3 on yelp we ended up paying 160 for two entrees and an appetizer plus a glass of champaign. Would not recommend.",1
We had high expectations based on the reviews but were very disappointed. Calamari was extremely salty and overcooked dark brown . Lasagna was cold in the middle. Seafood was strong flavored suggesting it was fresh. Paste was overcooked and mushy. Bread was stale. Price was way out of range from quality 100 for two people .,1
Loved this place! Came here because of a recommendation from a coworker and I am so thankful for it. nMy fiance and I decided to go for dinner and ended up there during happy hour although that's not tough because it is from 4 8pm. That is unheard of! nGreat local beers and the nachos were delish! And such good prices! nWill definitely be coming back here.,2
"OMG! Delicious comfort food. The grilled cheese is amazing. We had the Mac and cheese grilled cheese and the pierogies n at. Grilled cheese. Both were delicious! My only complaint if it can even be a complaint is that it was too large. I would prefer a half sandwich option especially since each sandwich comes with a small cup of tomato soup and fries. Again, delicious, but a little overboard.",2
"I'll make my first review a positive one. KO's is my families' go to restaurant. The servers and managers are always polite and friendly. It's a nice mix between bar and restaurant atmosphere, so my kids love it. There are time when you wonder if your server is ever coming back, especially when they are busy, but overall, the good food, service, atmosphere and price make this a solid pick.",2
"The most traditional stadium in the NFL with great sight lines from every seat. The most fan and kid friendly stadium as well as the safest. Great food with Bojangles, Krispy Kreme and JJRs BBQ. Wifi from ATT. New video boards and a sound system for 2014. Watch multi camera replays on the Panthers mobile app using wifi.",2
"I have never really had any bad experiences while flying, especially on Southwest. The fact that you can have two checked bags and a carry on free is awesome for the wallet, and their planes and staff are nice. The only problem I had in Phoenix was that there was a delay, but when it's about the plane it's not on the airline. Great job SWA!",2
We stopped by on our way to the Scottsdale Film Festival. I couldn't have been more impressed. What a cute cafe! The food was fresh and delicious! We split a specialty salad and the veggie wood fire pizza. The prices were very reasonable and the service couldn't have been better! I'm definitely coming back!,2
"Came here a month ago while staying at the Palazzo restaurant is in that hotel . Service was good. Prices, quality, and quantity of food was not. The crab appetizer tasted ok, but was small and expensive. The lobster pot pie didn't have much lobster in it, and had a lot of here and there vegetable scraps or something like that in it. Sorry Emeril.",1
"Best way to describe Wicked Spoon is to hold up your pinky finger ever so delicately and sneer. While I will admit that it is definitely one of the prettiest buffets I've ever seen, the food was definitely lacking, and the dessert selection was pretty boring. Highlight of the meal make your own mac and cheese. Definitely not worth the cost. There are definitely better buffets on the Strip.",1
"Amazing night all thanks to All Night Long djs! They provided all the entertainment for my wedding night. They were so professional,polite and covered everything. They played every song on my list and played requests for my guests. I was so happy with them I already booked them for my company hokiday party. Thanks to the owners Jeremy and Jeff! You guys were the best! See you in December.",2
"POOR SERVICE It took a very long time for the waiter to greet us and get drink orders. We received silverware that was not cleaned. Once we ordered our food the waiter never once came to ask us if we needed anything. We ate out entire meal without any refills of our beverages. When we discussed our concerns with the manager, his only response was sorry.",1
"Went with my.family Friday night. Our drinks were wrong, she forgot our waters, side of ranch, didnt check on us. My sisters steak was way over coockrd but by the time the waitress returned it, we were all ready to leave. Its obvious our food was sitting in the window for some time. I dont expect a great meal at this place. I only expect OK but this experience was simply terrible.",1
"Great location, close enough to walk but far enough away to feel like you are away from the smoke and noise. Room exactly as pictured but with some wear and tear. Concierge was great. Blue Chip was fine but had delayed response when calling to ask about early check out and never responded to call about late check out.",2
"Amanda Dustin are the owner of the place, Dustin was the one who also introduced me into the builder gel that they have which i absolutely love, they last so much longer than my normal acrylics that i use to get, so i end up saving money. Amanda is absolute amazing. i recommend both of them, they're normally busy so i would make an appt or call ahead of time ",2
"We made a reservation for indoors, and when we arrived they made us sit outside where it was freezing. The hostess said we would have to wait for 15 30 minutes if we wanted to sit indoors there was no one inside ! The food was disappointing and overpriced. Really a poor restaurant for being in the beautiful Palazzo.",1
Best pedicure I have every had! The salon is very clean and friendly. Oegative is that I didn't start getting my pedicure until 25 minutes after my appointment. They pay close attention to detail with my feet. The longest and most relaxing calm and foot massage I have every had. They must of worked on each leg for at least 5 minutes. Will definitely be back.,2
"I ordered the gyro combo. The guy behind the counter was rude with no personality whatsoever. It came out to 9.99. The gyro was burnt, dry, and chewy almost like a beef jerky! How do you mess up a gyro? I only took a couple of bites and I had enough! I only ate the fries which was the only good thing. I don't even want to give it one star because it was the worst gyro I've ever had. Yuck!",1
Stopped by this place for a drink and ended up staying for a couple more! Had a blast talking to the bar tender and playing video games while sipping on my PBR. We ordered up some fried mushrooms and another round. Seems to be a great place to hang out with a group and have a good time. I'll be back!,2
"For me, this is heaven. I love to see all of the new styles and seasonal colors on display. It truly makes me happy. The very best part is the sale wall all the way to the back. It's a glorious oasis of size 4's just waiting for me to come by and pluck them, like ripened grapes from the vine Delightful!",2
"The instructors at this studio make this place amazing! Eliza, Lisa, Alexis, Lauren, Greg, and Diana are all fabulous and make this studio worth coming to! Thank you guys for always giving 100 to your students. The instructors at Vegas Hot have truly made me love yoga and Pilates. If you haven't tried this studio yet you are missing out!",2
"Everything was OK except my 60.00 ! NY Steak was so gristly my jaw gave up the ghost trying to gnaw through it. My friend's Filet was just ""OK "". nForget about the ""old skool "" steakhouse feel and the fawning staff, how about turning out your key product at the highest, or at least, acceptable standard? nOr, change the name to Bally's Tendonhouse.",1
"We had a lovely inside dinner on a cold evening. The view was great, the atmosphere was warm, the service was perfect, and the food was excellent. The only drawback were the oddly Parker house style rolls that seemed to come from the grocery story. My fish stew was fantastic. Nice wines and drinks. Worth another special occasion visit.",2
"I haven't been here in quite a while but my opinion of it is that it's distinctly average. It has a few average chain pubs and restaurants. The Vue cinema and Virgin gym are pretty handy but not my favourite cinema and gym brands. The crowning glory that warrants its 2 stars is the awesome giraffe sculpture outside. Even if you just walk past the Omni centre to see them, that is worth it.",1
"Tony is awesome. The best hair cut I have had here in the valley. I will be a regular. I am glad I found him, my hair is cut perfectly. He worked with me when I really had no idea what I wanted. He came up with a game plan, and I could not be happier. Had a beer while I was waiting and watched ESPN in a comfortable chair. I will be telling all my friends to go see Tony for their grooming needs.",2
"good coffee, arts, music and overall vibe.as mentioned in other reviews reminds you of other independent coffeehouses in Cali, Texas and Pacific Northwest. It is interesting that it is over 21 in the evening.the guy checking id's s was nice enough. I didn't understand there being no lock on the unisex bathroom but maybe I am missing something?",2
its a hit and miss. there was one guy that was actually funny. nand actually did stand up. Harry Basil was the main act and it was terrible. na room full of adults and hes changing is to cheap costumes. nhe should do kid shows. have a few bucks and want to take the chance.like i said hit and miss ntotally went on a night where it was a complete miss.,1
"This place is just ""okay "" I am willing to give it another try once they have been open for a few months. I felt like they were a little unorganized. They keep the creamer behind the bar? I tried the iced tottie and it literally tasted like they added lime juice! Gross! Again, not trying to be negative nancy. but this place needs some work!",1
"Not a total sit down restaurant, not fast food either. Order at the counter, and have the amazingly friendly staff bring it to your table. For some Greek American food it's not bad. By no means fancy, but it tastes pretty good. I would say it's a step above a burger joint, for some simple, inexpensive food, come here and enjoy.",1
"Not pleased with the thai food. The dishes weren't nearly spicy enough, and there was nothing special about it the dish either. It was like every other thai place but this one was more expensive. n I got the pad thai fusion with red sauce. While the presentation was very impressive, the taste was nothing even coming close.",1
"I initially booked a room at a specific rate with Bridget, then I received a promotion and a confirmation for a lower rate from Alicia. Then, the GM Dillon called me and said he cannot honor the lower rate . I've never had anyone in the hospitality industry refuse to honor an agreed upon price and confirmation. Additionally, they did not offer any accommodation for their admitted mistake.",1
"The food is bland and service is suspect slow . clientele is senior citizens which I personally don't mind. food is a little expensive given the mediocrity of taste. I have been there twice now, and was underwhelmed both times. Probably wont go back, but if your 55 you should check it out as you might see some of your buddies.",1
"We love dim sum and this place satisfies the craving. We have been here at least 12 times since moving here a year ago. The chicken feet are always good as is the calamari, the taro cake, the custard tarts and pretty much everything really. I've always had good service and the price is average. nIts usually busy when we come and we have to wait for a table but its worth it.",2
"Fantastic restaurant for syrian food. It is like a hipper, younger, light spirited version of Aleppe. Highly recommend the potatoes, the hummus, and the chicken breast. Fattoush is good too. Youll need reservations on weekends not because theyre overwhelmingly busy, but because they arent very effective at distributing tables. Nonetheless, worth it!",2
We upgraded upon arrival. They gave us a suite with cum stained furniture and non workable TVs. The Mirage used to be my go to place but now will stay away until they clean up there act. Customer service was next to non existent. Management is not watching or don't care anymore. To bad cause it used to be a great Vegas stop. But that is now just a memory.,1
VEGETARIAN options in every food category! Awesome happy hour specials 3 6 am and pm where else can you get a glass of Stella for 3!?!? Football specials during every NFL game! Phenomenal staff super nice and friendly! Open 24 hours! And breakfast served 24 7! My new favorite hangout! Great gaming incentives! You must go!,2
"During my stay all of my jewelry was stolen. When I reported it to security, they didn't investigate or seemed concerned. They just told me nothing was turned in. Well, if someone from housekeeping stole my jewelry, why would they turn them in? These pieces were all Mother's Day gifts from my children and grand children. Shame on LVH for doing nothing!",1
"We've had the pizza from here a few times. It's good when your order comes out correctly. They are one for 4. The last time we ate their one of the pizzas was supposed to be a white pizza and it had buffalo sauce on it. How do they screw that up? AND they didn't bother coming over to apologize, get us a new pizza or comp their screw up. We're sticking with Grimaldi's.",1
"I love this place. All the girls are funny and sweet. My technician Gaby is beyond perfect. I give her a basic color and she finds the best shade and she can do any designs! Prices are good and I love the fact they take their time. You'll never need to worry about them rushing to get the next person in your seat. Clean, stylish, and fun atmosphere!",2
"I ordered the pine nut salad, tomato soup and also have had the mac and cheese kids size . Everything was delicious! The location is in the middle of a strip mall next to orange theory which I think is a little crowded, however the ambiance inside is great! They have eating outside as well if you would like.",2
"This place has gone downhill from years ago. In the past it was a really awesome Kosher style delicatessen. The menu was fantastic. Now when I went back to Vegas in December it's cafeteria style, and the menu is watered down. Whoever had the audacity to change a winning formula should have their brain examined. No longer will I consider the Carnegie delicatessen a must visit destination.",1
"I'm a big Starbucks drinker so I was super excited when I found out how close this one was to us! However, to my disappointment this has been the only Starbucks that does not hold up to par. Every time I have gone my drink has been messed up. Even simple drinks such as a hot green tea. So sadly to say we won't be going to this Starbucks any more.",1
"This company is not even worth 1 star. It's a SCAM, they take your , make all these promises and then do not fulfill any of them. Especially the cash exchange for your time share which is the main reason we purchased this . I feel so ashamed that we fell into their trap. Please do not let this happen to you.",1
"Service is friendly, pancakes are great. I had the veggie omelet, and it was alright, really nothing special. It does come with home fries cooked in bacon, which would have beeice to know. I only found out because I notice the bacon in my home fries. Small menu, not a lot of choices, only one lunch vegetarian option. I probably won't be back, but I wouldn't avoid the place.",1
"I have gone in 3 times for 3 separate reasons trying to support a local ""mom and pop "" store. Each time the owner has just been rude. He acts like everything he does is a favor. I am truly disappointed because I'd love to support another local business but he makes it just impossible. With a better attitude I'd do so much more business with him.",1
"Great company. Reasonably priced. They showed up a little late because of car troubles but called to say so.hey, it happens. Very professional and fast. Ran out of room in the truck I rented, didn't know I had that much s t, so they put the last item, our tv, in their own vehicle. Went above and beyond.would definitely recommend them.",2
this is the worst place i have ever eaten at. it was like walking in to a old folks home. the only thing that had flavor was my beer and they could not do that right. wast of my money and wast of my time. you are a mexican restaurant why the hell do u have a guy on the piano playing the girl from ipanema?,1
"The food here is a hit or miss. Some things on the menu are better than others. I had eaten here several times in all hours of the day and middle of the night. The price is decent. It's like a mini Cheesecake Factory open 24hrs. So for really late like 5am after club dining get the pho soup, pasta, or burger. The salads and soups I's pass.",2
"Agree with some other posts, this location is tough to make a success. Just left a completely empty place after my drink had flakes of some crude in the glass. They had only one bottle of red and nothing but Muscato for white. The bar tender was nice and friendly but the place is a mess. Hope First Ward can get a place that can make it some day.",1
"Go to meal cheddar butter burger, fried cheese curds, and flavor of the day custard. The difference between a deluxe burger and cheddar butter burger is that in the deluxe, you'll get American cheese. And you have to pay 25 cents extra to add lettuce, tomato, etc. to the cheddar butter burger. File that away in your memory bank.",2
"Gorgeous photos backed up by great customer service and friendly photographers. Tonya understands that the photos are not the center of the event, but meant to enhance the experience and when you see the results you know she has understood your event. I've worked with her on weddings, children's shots, studio work and special events. She's my first call.",2
"Won't be dining here again. The meant is like flash frozen, and once it's cooked it's like trying to chew rubber. The only thing really selling this place is that it's all you can eat. I'd rather go to Flat Top, same dining experience mongolian grill better ingredients, better food. I'd rather get full on good food, than fill myself with bad.",1
"We were lured up here with free drinks and glad we came up. The outdoor patio is filled with serveral little nooks and some cool furniture. Great views of the watershow at the Bellagio. The Rosemary Tapenade on warm flat bread was so delish. The sandwhiches were good, but a little dry, had to ask for more mustard. Overall we liked it so much, we came back the next day.",2
"I was happy to see another ""non hookah "" related establishment go up in my neighborhood. I tried a crossaint breakfast sandwich and a GIANT green tea. Came out to 11. The tea was great. The 6 sandwich was smaller than my fist. I realize this is a ""health "" food place and that ""we use fresh produce whenever available "" but I left hungry. I hope they realize how tough the summer will be.",1
"We were there for drinks and hanging out. There is a 5 cover charge for men. Got there noticed 3 different bar stations, 1 dance floor, 1 bull ride area, and outside patio. The music was a weird mix hip hop, pop, rock n roll, with a mix of country . It is OK. The crowd was a mix of 20 to 30s, and drop in a few 40s . Drinks were expensive!",1
Been here a couple times. Good home town cooking. NOT for the dieter. Come here and expect to gain some calories. They do have a happy hour where they have these 1 10oz'ers from draft. That was pretty cool. Prices aren't bad. They have a HUGE room in the back for large parties. I went for a friend's retirement and it was very convenient considering he knows MILLIONS of people it seems like.,2
"Nothing like Capriotti's in other cities. They don't have the same menu offerings as east coast locations, and even though I ate here wheot busy it took a very long time for the food to arrive. Parking is frustrating too because of the adjacent Starbucks patrons occupying so many spots. Very poor chips selection as well only two choices. Really? 2 chips?",1
Seriously? nMy cheesesteak had barely any meat inside. It was a pathetic combination of meat to bread. Are you that incompetent that you can't even compile a correct sandwich together. They must have been in a rush. THE QUALITY IS LACKING. nWhat a shame. I thought I lucked out having it so close to my house. I'll stick to the one on paradise and harmon.,1
"Been here twice, loved it each time. I ordered it for the office and everyone else agreed that it was delicious. They are true NY pizza and their garlic knots are TO DIE FOR! I'm not sure what kind of expectations people have if they call this pizza terrible. It's on par with any other place I've had in the Valley and definitely one of the better ones in the East Valley.",2
"The best European Pastry's I ever found in the Phoenix Metro Area. If you are used to have a beautiful and very tasty European Pastry's for the Holidays and don't have the time to make it, this is the place to pick up some goodies for any event! Always Very fresh! Also try their bread it is Best in Town!",2
"A buddy of mine that is a local in LV recommended a GREAT breakfast joint after a night of partying! This was such a treat. The pricing is slightly hefty but what they bring out of the kitchen, leaves you pretty stunned. The food is enormous and the preparation looks awesome. You truly get what you paid for and more. Had the Chicken and Waffles, no complaints! Food 8.5 9 nService 8.5",2
"The food is excellent. The prices are very reasonable. The people are pleasant. In addition to the four tables for dining in, there is a fascinating array of groceries for sale. We always end up with a few items to take home. The ambience is fine except for the constant sound of refrigerators, which sound ieed of help. This is overall a gem.",2
"If I could give zero star I would. Awful policies.I asked them to put my beans on a separate plate but Then I would get charged extra.just to slap it on a separate plate. I then asked for an extra empty plate and they charge you extra for that. This place really needs to rethink their policies, they could care less about customers. At least the server was nice.",1
"By Las Vegas standard this hotel should be one star. The new Tropicana is ""lipstick on a pig "". The rooms had no sound barriers, you can hear your neighbor talking, flushing, and . The service is even worst. No one in this hotel has any idea what customer service and guest relation is about.so don't bother complaining.",1
"I was so disappointed when I came here. I'm from Los Angeles and was expecting the same taste as the la locations but boy was I wrong. Granted I had breakfast, but can you really mess up breakfast that bad? YES! I don't even want to try anything else from here. I've been so disappointed eating at these ""soul food "" places here in las Vegas. Inspiring me to open my own!",1
"This is one of the nicest gyms in town. Aside from the outdoor pool I'm not a fan , this gym has all of the newest equipment. I enjoy the cardio equipment with Nike along with personal monitors. The Hoist equipment is awesome. The staff is never rude to me and I enjoy the Group X classes, especially Yoga with either Susi, Gez or Rabeeya.",2
"The illy coffee when made correctly is to die for! But the croissants at 5.00 a piece, W O W! The quality of the coffee beverage that you order can differ from day to day based on who makes it, so I have to reduce my rating of them by a few b c of the cups of coffee with little to no flavor in them that I received. nLiked Service, Atmosphere, Decor Disliked Food, Value",1
"Customer service was great.I ordered a hot n ready FRESH with butter parmesan on it. It was delicious fresh hot.all for 6.50.the interior was pretty clean, but as I walked up to the door there was a homeless person who made kind of like a couch and was sitting outside asking for as you leave the store ",1
"I love the Orbit and have been using it more now that the Light Rail has started. It's a great service, but I really wish the bus drivers would do more to keep obviously drunk homeless people off the bus. It's easy, it's free, and the drivers are mostly accommodating. They just need to start kicking people off when they're acting a fool.",2
"The food is way over rated. Good but amateurish service. We had to wave down the staff all dinner for chips and salsa, water, extra drinks and our check. The food was maybe one star plus. Go to Los Sombreros for nThe real deal. I forgot, the chips were a massive grease pit. They actually dripped when you took them out of the bowl.",1
"line moved wayyyyy too slow. If you want to get in here you have to be in line be at the very latest 10 oclock. I stood in line from 10 to 12 and still didnt get in. some people in other reviews said the bouncers are pretty mean, i think that's true but i did have an okay experience with one of them. don't expect to get in here unless you've got fat pockets or are freaking ridiculously hot.",1
"This place has a fantastic atmosphere, was extremely clean, service was excellent, and the food was just as good as I was expecting. Fresh! There is not a good bakery around like this and it is about time. Very busy restaurant.but worth the wait. I recommend getting lunch with a pastry to go. Very fulfilling and good value for the money. I'll be back!",2
"If you like your food hot, right, or fast this is not the place for you. If your idea of a ""bottomless cup "" is more than 0 refills this is not the place for you. If you expect flatware or napkins or waitstaff that checks on you at all, this is not the place for you. Too bad because I love Red Robin burgers and shakes but this place has some serious problems with their dinner service.",1
"WORST MCDONALDS EVER! Every single time we have been to this McDonalds on Southern Highlands Parkway we ask for our burgers and fries to be made up fresh. They never are, in fact, they are cold and the buns are cold as well. Step it up McDonalds! Your reviews are bad and this is the Manager's fault!",1
"Take note of the string of bad reviews recently posted.and respond accordingly by not patronizing this horrible establishment. Bad service and worse food. Everything is way over priced and disgusting. On a bright note, my server cared about her appearance as she spent the entire time at our table staring into the mirror on the wall behind us.",1
Red dragon continues to lead with money first customer second so this one is no different than the other foodie fest . They keep changing venues which lets you know that they are gonna run out of places willing to host . Las Vegas is full of great places to eat without having to fill the pockets of a greedy company that doesn't care about its ticket holders or your feedback .,1
"I bought a groupon and it seemed like a great deal.however it was not! The nail tech was late and I feel like I got a regualar mani pedi, nothing felt spa like, I have gotten a better pedicure at wal mart.def not worth the full prices listed! It was hard making an appointment but I eventually got one. The color options are very slim, no OPI or essie.don't waste your money or time!",1
"We went there for the lunch special. I'm not sure why yelp said it was closed? We are outside on the patio, under the umbrella, very nice. nI got the salmon and my boyfriend got the veal Coleta. They gave us a bottle of wine for 30 which was delicious as was the food! Our Italian server was nice and very fast! We had a great experience and will definitely be back.",2
"The food and our server Nay were great. We sat at a table at the bar and 2 guys we thought were patrons who turned out to be employees of Applebee's were out of control loud and dropping curse words left and right. No one, not even the manager, asked them to quiet down. There were children in the restaurant.",1
"I came here because they were the only ietwork place I could go to that's open on Saturdays which is nice for someone who works Monday through Friday. The only thing about going in there is that you smell cleaning solution that is good for a doctor office, but then they go get food for lunch and both of those smells together make you wanna puke. The doctor and staff are very nice!",2
"A Pittsburgh version of DeBruno Brothers in Philadelphia, Zabars in NYC. On entry, you are immediately hit with food smells. They have everything for your charcuterie and pasta needs. Cheeses, cured meats, breads, home made pasta. I wanted everything there. Don't go hungry or do Very reasonable prices.",2
"Very friendly service, very pro active! They were fast and asked questions to make my Wich the best tasting instead of just how I ordered it. I almost put mayo and mustard on a French dip. That woulda been super weird. I was totally not thinking! Too used to ordering regular sandwiches. The Wich was skinny looking but was very filling. Overall, I would definetly come back!",2
Salsa was ok but the eggs were awful how does this place stay open? Its disgusting food. They served us huevos rancheros with burnt fries dried up cheese. The best way to judge mexican food is by the beans.they were awful. The cocinero was horrible .I had to quit writing this because I was sick for a few hours .,1
"Contacted them because of the stellar reviews. He wanted me to text him, which was great at first. Said he'd contact me to set up an appointment and it's been over a week and I haven't heard back. Guess I'll take my business elsewhere. Really disappointed because so many good things were said here on yelp.",1
"Personally discovered this place a couple months ago and I am trying to eat here as often as possible before I move this summer. I have tried 5 6 different bowls and have licked every one clean. Fresh ingredients, all together delicious. My favorite so far Drunken Noodle. Kind of weird entry behind the Party City, but very cool vibe inside and amazing food. Try it. Thank me later.",2
"Fischer's pest control is one of the local LV businesses that wants to stay in business! They were really helpful walking me through my initial pest questions, provided timely service at a rate that I couldn't beat elsewhere. When I wanted to switch services it was painless, and they are proactive so it makes the problems go away from their side! Recommend highly.",2
Mexican food is one of my favorites so every time I get a chance to eat at a Mexican restaurant I have to try the chimichanga. This is by far is the best one I have found and I've tried a lot of places! They also have wonderful tasting enchiladas and tacos. The food tastes super fresh and you can tell they take the time to prepare their food the right way!,2
"For those of you who wanna try something different and delicious this is the spot! From eating Platanos Fritos fried plantains for breakfast to eating the mostpopular dish of Pupusas for dinner. I love everything in the menu, never tried the Salvadorian tamales? Well try them they're soooo good! Enjoy!",2
"Love this place. Whenever I'm back home, I get my dry cleaning done here. Their prices aren't the lowest in town, but this place reaffirms the aphorism You get what you pay for. Really, really friendly staff. If you're like me you just want your dry cleaning done right and fast without the person behind the counter snarling at you.",2
Absolute best place to get waffles in Vegas. The waffle has an excellent texture and is soo tasty. The whipped cream on the top is one of the best parts. nThe sandwiches are also really good. nThe kale champ smoothie is good if you're a fan of kale. If you don't like kale try a fruity smoothie because you can still taste it. nSo far I haven't had a bad meal here!,2
"I asked for a laffa and got a totilla wrap, staff are clueless, pita bread was not soft and just crumbled. My son ordered a pita pocket, with just salad and hummus, 8.00. nNot worth the money. Dont see this place lasting very long. Will not go back. Falafel is from frozen. I lived in Israel for many years, and this is an embarrasment to Israeli food. I am so disappointed.",1
"Sammiches are always delicious, love the music. had live jazz last time i was there. Big fan. n I will say the first time we went here we weren't sure if we sat ourselves or were seated by someone because we weren't greeted so what seemed like a couple of awkward minutes just standing by the door, I think we just sat ourselves.",2
"We went to Red Rock today to experience Pinks and it was CLOSED! Not just closed due to operating hours but CLOSED! What is going on?!?! nBased on the fact that we didn't eat or get service I'd have to say one star gets it for now. Yes, we know there is a location at the PH but being local we don't want to deal with that.",1
"Went on a Sunday night for industry night. Started a little slow with music I wasnt into.house techno. There were moments of hip hop songs that I knew, but they were rare. It's a good thing they had discounted tables and I drank a lot or else I would have had to give them 3 stars. nWent on a Saturday night and LOVED it though.",2
"I really don't understand the snarky reviews. We've stayed at LVH for years. We've always had very nice rooms. And u00fcber cheap. I agree casino isn't massive. Don't understand 20 resort fee. But when in Vegas! Maybe new owners will make some positive changes,who knows. Great front desk staff. In fact we're returning next month.",2
Very knowledgable and friendly staff. I have a dog with allergies and a sensitive stomach and they were great in pointing me out to a few different foods that would be suitable for her. They have a wide array of samples as well. Great treat and toy selection as well. I'd definitely recommend to any dog owner. This place pretty much has it all.,2
"Absolutely adore pita jungle. I'm not a vegetarian but I love their food. I get the fattoush salad which is warm rice and beans and tons of garlic on romaine. I've had their schwarmas, their falafal and their hummos and have never had a bad experience. The new location makes me super happy. Parking can be hard sometimes but there is a garage just next door.",2
"The night i went to this was on a saturday and it was a old crowd. If that's how it is on a Saturday night. Then that's probably the norm for that place. It's not a bad place to go to if you wanna find a cougar or a milf. Or a sugardaddy for you ladies out there. or men, However you get down . I did like the live band that was playing there, Party Mcfly. Nice Back to the Future play on words.",1
"Nice design and atmosphere. Very mediocre service. Extensive menu that gets your hopes up, but I've never really had anything very good there. As I live nearby, I can't wait until they are replaced by something else. It seems popular, but I think people are all pretending to like it. It's far from a bad place, but it's not good enough to go to in my opinion.",1
Horrible service but the food is good. I went to the Zipps on camelback all the time and was so excited when this one opened up in Glendale. Other than the food this is NOT the same restaurant. I always order my food to go to avoid the horrible management restaurant chain atmosphere and poor service. Disappointing.,1
"I made a reservation for next Wed at 7 pm. Two days later, Aquaknox called me and said ""We have a big party coming in on Wednesday and we can't accommodate your reservation, but we have an opening at 9 pm "". I'm going elsewhere. nNot the kind of service I expect in a city focused on entertainment and trade shows.",1
"SEA BASS HOT POT.sooo gooood. 8.99 lobster.how do you beat that deal?! My family comes here at least twice a month, it's a bit far from the strip but well worth the trip. I've never been disappointed with any dishes here and just found out it's opened really late. also if you order 4 dishes, they give you free soup and boiled whole chicken. Definitely worth checking out",2
"I don't understand why this place has bad reviews.I've been coming to Tom for a couple years now,and he is fantastic. Not only does he do a great job on my nails that NEVER lift or break but extremely friendly. At one point I was driving across town just to have him do my nails! Everyone is friendly and it's a relaxing atmosphere not to mention good prices.",2
"I love this place. I was sad when I saw the Roberto's close here but was pleasantly surprised to see Algoberto's opening. I eat here at least twice a week, and I ate the Carne Asada Fries for dinner last night. nI love the food here, the only thing negative is it can be a little pricey. Their drinks are a major up charge, but there is a gas station across the way to get cheap drinks from.",2
"I really wanted to like this place but i had an awful first experience, and that's enough to turn me off. Yep, i had the dreaded, HAIR IN MY SOUP! Then the staff looked at me like it was my fault. WTF, take it away and comp it. Don't you dare try to not take full responsibility. It can happen, i understand, but it's your job to make it right.",1
"horrible, i felt raped. the salad bar is inadequate, u are paying a lo of money for a a little. have been to shima in charlotte, what a difference. u at least get steak, here the pawn off kielbassa poor quality pork something, very fatty all in all if u want a brazilian steakhouse go to another restaurant, this falls far short of being a steakhouse.",1
"excellent service! it was super busy here early in the morning, but the staff was speedy and smiley, and made changes to drinks according to food allergies as needed without any protest. they also serve drinks that are not typically on the menu, which is appreciated. great way to sweeten up my layover!",2
"The music was really loud by the pool, I could hear it from my room on the 14th floor, I prefer the night club action at the night club. Their gaming promotion, first 200.00 on them, is very misleading, very very misleading. The gaming machines are tight, don't mind losing if I can at least play a while.",1
"Pretty solid pizza joint. Now, let me preface, I am staying at the Cosmo.would I trek up and down the strip searching for this place if I wasn't staying here? Maybe. I would say if you are in the nearby vicinity and have a hankering for a decent pie that wont break the bank this is a great place to check out.",2
"One F'ing word to share about ""White Cock "". BRAVO! Let me just say. the morning coffee was blended, roasted and brewed to perfection. and my breakfast. I don't recall what I had. it was THAAAAT GOOOD!. All's I remember is having several orgasms. And Lunch. whell! It's simplely divine. I certainly am a fan to Gallo Blanco. It's Yummm 4 Days.",2
"Defintely will be visiting this place again! Followed fellow yelpers there and is did not disappoint. Great fresh burgers at good prices. Any place that offers FAT or skinny fries is good in my book. I need to try those Chencho fries next, they look good. Only drawback is its on the opposite side of town and is really small.",2
"This Giant Eagle is a small version of the chain. Not as much selection as other Giant Eagles as you may expect. They also tend to be pretty busy. My experiences with their customer service has been OK. My questions have been answered accurately and in a professional manner. Not a bad, smaller neighborhood store. They always seem to have plenty of parking.",2
"This restaurant is located in the Venetian. The food was delicious, although customer service is extremely slow. I ordered the Pea Soup for an appetizer, which was very tasteful. Thick creamy, topped off with dungenous crab. The white corn ravioli entree was good too, but could've used a little more flavor more cheese perhaps? Heard there's one in SF as well. I would definitely go back.",2
"Food is awesome and huge portions so there's always left overs! My favorite is the Alfredo the Dark or the Big Rig, I tried the El Diablo shrimp pasta but was disappointed! It's very spicy which I like but not nearly as good as their other pastas! Wouldn't recommend that dish, other than that their food is always my go to. End your meal with a pizookie to top it off, their delicious!",2
"Equipment is new and up to date. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Frequent specials going on. They are also very flexible with scheduling, which is much appreciated due to my crazy schedule. I never have to wait long. But if I do have to wait a little bit I don't mind because I know I can expect to get the same unhurried care that the previous client received.",2
"I go to Whole Foods from time to time to get groceries, but they tend to be on the higher side to use them as a constant option. Instead, I like WF for their bulk beauty supplies, their pre made foods, and their smoothie bar. Compared to the one in Town Square, it is lacking in the last two fields. I came in and ended up walking out. I could not find anything.",1
"Aunt Chiladas hosted the latest Yelp event and what an event it was. The food was excellent. i was especially partial to the tamales.ate several. the chips and salsa at each table were excellent as well. the margaritas from the bar were nice and sweet salty, just the right ratio. we'll definitely check them out again for their regular menu!",2
"Perfect location,perfect atmosphere,perfect view.Nice sofa , nice chair position setup with huge Starbucks LOGO on the wall. It's awesome Starbucks store that I have been l love to hangout at here whole days . Back yard is Mandarin hotel . At left side opposite of the street is Crystals GUCCI store .",2
I Dupar's! I have only ever been to one location. GoldenGate Casino on Fremont Street Las Vegas and can only assume the whole chain is as excellent as my fav go to in Vegas! nProTip Pancakes! weird that I show only one checkin here. I've been to Vegas 8 times in the past 3 years and I've been to Dupar's at least half a dozen times!,2
I was in Vegas this week and purchased a travelzoo deal for Andre's. It was a three course prefix meal for two. My expectations were definitely surpassed. Everything tasted so good that I didn't want to stop eating even though I was stuffed. I will definitely return to Andres next time I am in Vegas. The creme brul u00e9 was amazing. The steak was flavorful. And the lobster bisque was to die for.,2
"The staff is extremely rude. They have absolutely no knowledge of customer service. Placed an order and the person who answered the phone said 15min for delivery. After over an hour, I called to check on the status and the they said we dont deliver and hug up on me. They've definitely lost myself and my friends as customers.",1
"The haircut was nice and so was the styling, but I shouldn't have paid as much as I did. I was told over the phone that the haircut would be 25.00, but they ended up charging 35.00 real price 40.00 it was a ok experiance, but not worth the money. I would suggest telling them you're age, hair type, and length before going to get your haircut.",1
"Have to applaud the service and camaraderie at this awesome place! nThe band we got to hear, Black Bottom Lighters, were not only great musically, they were really nice guys. nThe manager, Jackie, is one of the most accommodating ppl I've met and extremely professional. nThe bartender, Jaramie, is as cool as her name. nAnyone who is smart enough to come here will be glad they did!",2
"I came here at least four times, so I don't think it's a one time deal. nThe food here is VERY BLAND. nMaybe it is because of the organic ness of the ingredients, but I do not like this place. It is a nice place to meet up with people who live on campus and such. nBut I will rather go to other places on State.",1
The older over weight Asian lady with the glasses that always works the counter needs to be fired she never makes dropping off or picking up your prescriptions smooth or easy. She is extremely slow and has a terrible attitude like she hates her job. When I see her at the window I just want to walk away.,1
"Going to make this short and sweet like my review of Grimaldi's at Palazzo. get a meatball, pepperoni and ricotta pie. You won't be disappointed. Ceasar salad is simple and just right. Definitely one of the better options at the Fashion Show Mall. Service was good and food was on point with other locations.",2
"yes. yes. yes. or oui. oui. oui. had a lot of fun here. it was very french indeed, and i ate it all up in some ways literally . i would definitely go back and would recommend it to others. great location on the strip, nice casino, really nice rooms, great amenities. just overall a really great hotel experience.",2
"Food took forever to cone out and was cold when it did. Nobody ever checked on us and we saw our waitress a whole three times between our food arriving and paying our bill. Despite the restaurant being empty, the manager never checked on us. This place obviously is not in business because of the service.",1
"This place was great few months back. They had an amazing staff, little by little they are all leaving due to owners yelling screaming and controlling behavior. We used to be regulars, I think the success got to the owners head, who likes to be called ""The Chef "". Unfortunately last few times, we have been there the service hasn't been so good. We need another high end steak house in Peoria.",1
"Had lunch at season's buffet in silverton casin salad bar was good. Did care for marinara sauce that I had with spaghetti. NONE of the desserts were any good. Had good iced tea good service. My husband liked the beef green beans, mashed potatoes, so don't get Italian food. Ham was good but barb b que sauce no good he said.",1
"While looking for a deal on good quality furniture for my new condo I was somewhat disappointed in this place. They have quite a selection and you can't tell any of it has been used, but the prices were higher than what I would expect for consignment, the staff was inattentive, and many bedroom pieces were being sold as a set.",1
"Our waiter was laying on the French accent thing really really thick. I thought he was faking it for the benefit of the tourists, but when he started conversing with the Qu u00e9b u00e9cois to at the next table i realized he was legit. Food was great, the fries that come with the steake frites are a thin chip like version, I'd prefer thicker shoestring ones, but a small quibble.",2
"So happy we ate here with so many great restaurants listed in Scottsdale to choose from. Our server, Bradley was casual, but so professional. The atmosphere was fun and loved dining in the patio area. The cocktails were great and the food even better! Had the meatloaf and pork belly pastrami. We will be back.",2
"The only problem I've ever had here was one in October when they were out of pumpkin, but they said all Einsteins in the area were. Aside from that, I've always enjoyed this location. It feels like a coffee shop inside, with people gathered to read papers and star their days. The ambiance almost makes me feel like I am back in college while I am there.",2
"Best pancakes around. Staff is always friendly the breakfast is always delicious. Portions are massive , makes a great brunch location, 7am 3pm. My favorite is the cinnamon apple topped pancakes . However they are best known for. n Omelettes. With 38 to chose from you will definitely find something you like. Give it a try and you'll see.",2
Took the Bin Bo Hue and some spring rolls home. Bin Bo was boring at best. I would say more if the spring rolls weren't so toxic. First bite only stayed in my mouth for a second! Sorry about that image. The shrimp were past their use by date by at least 2 weeks. That the cook didn't smell the biohazard smell coming off of them may explain the rest of the food. Never again!,1
"Made reservstion months ago. I was here at the appointed time. I have now waited for 45 minutes ao car is yet available. Manager at the counter says , more or less, "" too bad keep waiting. "" n Wouldn't Hertz charge me if I return the car late? I paid extra because I thought the Hertz brand meant something. No more, next time I'm going to discount brands.",1
The food was really fresh and good however the building was really dirty and the bathrooms for filthy. The dining room is dirty and there's no napkins or lids for the drinks. The only way this place is open it's because the food is good the rest of the staff is lousy the dining room is lousy and everything else is dirty!,1
"while the price is appealing, not much else is. the rolls are not original or particularly well executed, they use too much rice and the seaweed paper is chewy, the fish was not fresh but tasted OK. maybe its a culture clash myself being from California, where I can find a better sushi place by sneezing onto my GPS.",1
This has become my all time favorite place to eat in Vegas. . especially when friends from out of town are visiting because not only is the food delicious and the service great but if you sit on the patio you get the best view in town with the Bellagio fountain show going off across the street and all the people watching you can do on the strip,2
"its been over a year since I've had this pollo! I dont eat fast food often but when I do I make sure to take advantage of the coupons which is what brought me nin today! I got an 8piece chicken w tortillas and the mango chicken tostada all for around 11. their chicken is still bomb.com is that saying still used? bomb.com ahahhahah! anywho, make sure to try their green salsa made with avocados.",2
"I would have given this place a 0 if it would have allowed me to. Check my check in for the whole story. Please, insist on making sure your order is put in. If not and your order is lost like ours were, it's on you! I'm being honest and trust me when I tell you we walked out after no food was ever served.",1
The staff were all very polite. We were seated right away and able to order quickly. However we noticed that orders sat for several minutes before being delivered. When we received our food sure enough it was cool. However the country fried steak was steamy hot. The cooks need to learn the proper food prep order so everything is hot. Won't be back to this location.,1
"Excellent food! The biggest problem is deciding what to eat, given their extensive menu. Lots of excellent rolls for under 6. And, if you want to get deluxe rolls, there is no shortage of unique combinations that are well worth the extra expense. The place is on the small side, so make a reservation on the weekend.",2
"I enjoyed my first visit to this fun boba joint. The menu offers a large selection of delicious slushies, teas, coffees, etc. Prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly. Wi Fi is available. So many flavors to choose from. They even offer to adjust the sugar levels! I'm definitely coming back.",2
Went here for dinner got there at 5 45 to get a burger and relax with friends. They tell us the grill is already shut down for the night. We point out the grill doesn't close until 6pm and it's only 5 45. Waitress agrees it is only 5 45 pm but they shut the grill down early. This was the second time that they closed the grill early. So if you looking for dinner out better get here REAL EARLY.,1
"For a ""fruiterie "", they don't actually have a lot of different fruit to choose from, and most of it doesn't look very fresh. You're really better off going to a supermarket. Most of the space is actually taken up by tea, spices, and other dry goods. Likewise, not a particularly interesting selection of them. It's cheap, at least.",1
Horrible! Assaulting people! Bad bad servers. horrible experience. Food good price not so good. Charges extra for big groups. Automatically charges tip. Family vacation ruined. Lady pushed my aunt for no reason and came at the rest of the family. Trying to kick us out for no reason. Terrible terrible! Calling police.,1
"ehhhhh, that sums up this place. I felt like I was paying way too much for the quality of food I was getting. But wait I know people are going to talk about the ""huge selection "" they have, who cares! So, because a place offers a huge selection of crap its somehow good? Wrong! If you are looking for a huge selection and large portions check out Claim Jumper which is much better.",1
"Arrogant, a hole bartender with a condescending attitude. Not one compelling menu item. Intelligencia sort of atmosphere, that was not appealing to me. Very comfortable patio chairs.great view for watching people.but if you are craving dinner, walk 100 steps to another Kierland establishment. nI will never darken their door again. nVery French in their attitude.if you know what I mean.",1
"We had a cheese pan pizza. If you are looking for Chicago style deep dish, this is not the place to find it. The crust was pretty bland, there was very little sauce and the cheese was just ok. Overall the pizza was bland, with too much crust compared to sauce and cheese. We probably won't return here, at least not for the pan pizza.",1
"This is the first place I ever did yoga, and it was by far the best experience I've had. The teachers were VERY patient, NOT snobby at all, and the students all generally seemed to be pleased with their experience. And at only 10 per class, you can't beat it. The Squirrel Hill studio is my favorite. I recently have gone to several other studios, and none top Schoolhouse!",2
I love this place. Possibly another new favorite place of mine! Jason and Lindsay were amazing servers. They have trivia on Wednesday nights and the place was full! I tried the beer sampler which was great and fun. Also tried the nachos they weren't really anything to write home about. Had a great time here!,2
Order a dessert here and call it a day. The entrees and appetizers tasted mediocre which was voted unanimously by my group of 20. Cardinal restaurant sin occured when one person did not get her meal for over 30 minutes after everyone else so we saw her just starting to eat after we all finished. Plus star for comping her meal but not enough of a gesture to salvage the offense.,1
"Yup, just what you'd expect from the Vegas strip. Too salty or no flavor is pretty much the overall feeling. The asparagus was too lemony and the onion rings too hot, duck breast too much cumin and the filet was better with ketchup, just to round out the flavor profiles that didn't work or needed help. VG wine list worth one of the stars . Expected high price and mediocre service.",1
"The ""Protein Pancakes "" are always a treat, but the ""California Eggs Benedict "" was just awful today. The biggest disappointment were the hash browns though. They tasted like shredded cardboard. I am tired of going to a restaurant 20 to 30 times and getting such inconsistent results. Shame on you US Egg!",1
The worst place to rent a limo. I made a reservation 3 days before my wedding then the have the balls to call me in the middle of my wedding demanding more money from me. Are you serious? I made a reservation 3 days before my wedding and you find the mistake an hour before I'm scheduled to get picked up? Never again.,1
Horrible ! Not kid friendly the staffers rude honestly. Someone had confirmed my appointment for my. Kids at 9 came in and they said it was at 945 and they didn't say sorry rude no smiles unfriendly ! I would not recommend them I will defiantly transfer to another clinic still isn't he waiting room been here since 840 now it's 10 am . How joyful I haven't seen the Drs. Yet,1
"Love this place. Stiff martinis and cocktails, cheap drinks, good service, nice atmosphere to chill in the upstairs lounge and hang up with your friends. Classy crowd and much more mature, older, and professional crowd. There aren't any of those college frat boys or belligerent drunks there, which is so great. Very nice place to wind down after a long day.",2
"Went here on a recommendation from someone who clearly has never had the kind of Thai food that's so good you may lay down in the road for it. The food was mediocre, the waiter looked like he was angry and wanted us to die. The only thing worth mentioning were the potato pockets. Those were pretty good, but not enough to consider going back.",1
"I've been lucky enough to dine at Carly's when visiting PHX. The food is awesome! Great local ingredients and attention to detail. In addition, the owner is about as generous and gracious as they come. She agreed to help me provide delish snacks to some local friends after the birth of their little one. I am located in FL, and it meant the world to me. Thank you Carly, and you amazing team!",2
"I have been going to this practice about a year and really like Dr. Tolson. My family also sees him and agrees. He takes the time to listen to you and doesn't make you feel rushed. The office staff is just ok, but I don't go there to see them so it really doesn't matter that much to me. They seem to be able to get you in quickly if you are having a problem.They also do blood work there.",2
"It's a feast for the eyes, and the added effect of the water is a great touch. The colorful lighting and the rippling water creates a gorgeous effect that looks like liquid colored glass. It is beautifully choreographed, has artistic lighting effects, a great soundtrack, and great performers. It got a little dull and slow at some points, but overall a great show. Definitely a must see in Vegas.",2
"I've never ventured off the south end of the Strip to eat before how sad is that? , but after finding this place, I'm so glad I did! I'm dying to go back to Vegas, just so I can go here again. It's reasonably priced, the tapas are all delicious I can't think of a single thing we didn't like and the mojitos are very tasty. Make a reservation, though! It's pretty busy.",2
"I wanted to like this place, I really did, but here's why I didn't. nThe rolls I had were smothered in what I call flare sauces, mayo, garnish, etc. nThe nigiri was sloppy and also has flair nWay too many people here that wandered over from the strip nHowever, 25 all you can eat? awesome You better believe I ate myself stupid! nThe mochi ice cream kicks a !",1
Great salon! I got a last minute appointment on a busy holiday eve. Linda was fabulous. She recommended a better shape for my weak nails and filed them perfectly. She even filled in the chips. My nails look great! I selected the OPI Infinite Shine polish and my nails look fabulous. Good value too! I will definitely be back!,2
"This KFC was the worst in insulting you with the ""food "" they serve. They will sell you chicken that is old . so old that the juice settles back into the breading on their ""extra crispy "" that it actually turns grey and soggy. This has made me decide to spend my money 22.00 to be exact elsewhere. .Mr. Sanders would be ashamed. .",1
"Hard pressed to find a better patio on the strip, we ate lunch here three times in two days. Good sun, good people watching, and affordable. Two days in a row we prevented hangovers from taking hold with bloodies, Chardonnay, and strong vodka tonics. Yummy. Stay away from the soups, and focus on the steak offerings, just sayin'.",2
My daughter loves the salad but we are not going to bring her to get it any more. Every single time I bring her we are rushed in line and receive the WORST customer service. I am also gluten sensitive and when I asked for gluten free options no options were available. I was told that maybe the grilled chicken is ok. just not good enough. Fail on customer service. Fail on gluten free.,1
"I love Yelp. I found this hidden jewel because of Yelp. It is tucked away. I love BBQ. This place was outstanding. The food is authentic and very tasty. I had the Biggin sandwich which had brisket, pulled pork and sausage for 8.99. The sandwich was large and sooo good. It was full of meat. The meat is very smokey and tender. I was very surprised about the size of the sandwich for the price.",2
"Purchased a Hill Injection a year and a half ago and have been doing high end detailing ever since, incredible machine, unfortunately it did take a week or so to get used to the new process but after that there's no looking back. Thanks Sebastien and Brent for your advice and help throughout the process. Looking forward to getting a 220V unit next.",2
RUN! Pooooooor EXTREMELY POOR service what ever you do don't bother bringing your pet here the owner doubled the price all of the sudden when I question why she told me to come get my dog and hung up in my face shity customer service and jerks! There are Plenty of other places to go to Don't pick this awful place!.and to the owner screw you!,1
"My husband and I dropped by on the way home from Vegas. It seems they advertise their drinks but we didn't try any. Since it's called Fat Dumpling, I expected good food. The XLB had the right flavor but not very juicy. The shrimp dumplings had barely any shrimp in it, mostly greens. The green onion pancake was dry and tasted like flour. The seaweed salad and bean curd salad were bland.",1
Stay away from this mall. Both Sephora and H M are super small while other shops are average brands. What makes it worst is the mall is filled with little carts selling no name skincare products. The sales were so aggressive pulling you over to sell you whatever they can at whatever price they want to set.,1
"Yea, it's a Wendy's but great service! Usually when you're in an airport the service is rude, good thrown together, and extremely overpriced. The line was long and they were busy and the employees were always smiling and pleasant. Not that obnoxious fake pleasant either. They were genuine. The food was great! They do charge 31 cents per ranch but that's corporates policy, not theirs.",2
"An authentic family run deli experience. The Italian Sausage is out of this world get it with a side of beef juice to dip it in. This is an Italian grocery store, a meat market, and a deli all in one. Do yourself a favor and give Guido's a try soon. Very casual atmosphere with a few booths if you choose to dine in.",2
"Mango Pineapple Smoothies like crack. without the nasty side effects! This McDonald's is super fast. like lightning! Don't ever be afraid of a long line in the drive through. I honestly only ever go to McDonalds for a quick drink see comment above . or while on roadtrip for the kids nuggets are easy, no mess, finger food in the car .",2
"Great Ethiopian.only reason it doesn't get five stars is that I've been to Adams Morgan in DC and had some really great Ethiopian! For the valley, this is one of the best places to find Ethiopian and the vegetarian platter is very good. Plus, they have sweet wine here.guaranteed to make your visit even better!",2
"Don't go the buffet route! After reading multiple reviews on yelp I elected to take my family there for lunch we decided on the buffet and OMG where was all the hype? I would rather have china star. Every dish was typical and boring. Fried rice, beef broccoli, chow mein, blah, blah, blah. Sorry no exceptional dishes to boast about.",1
"Raku never disappoints. The quality of food and service surpasses any Japanese restaurant in Vegas. Venturing off the strip and the wait is worth it! There's no words to describe how great the menu is with genius offerings like potato INSIDE a grilled corn. favorites grilled rice ball, sashimi salad, potato w corn, portabella mushroom, desserts!",2
"That's right we're not tipping you, maybe if you had some posture, and weren't sitting on your ass when we came to the door, and maybe if you season your shrimp, and maybe if you didn't charge us double, and maybe if you were more interested in service rather than selling alcohol, and I've seen more menu items in the restroom is i out burger. So why don't you write the zeros on the top line.",1
i went in for an oil change and there was one car ahead of me in line. I waited around about 15 minutes before they got to my car. The shop is your typical oil change place. nothing spectacular but decent. The staff was friendly and helpful.After about another 15 20 minutes my car was ready. The place is about 5 minutes from where I live so I'll definitely be going back,2
Went because I got a coupon in the mail. Confusing as heck.pick your pedi and we'll give you the discount. I had no idea what my discount ended up being despite several attempts to clarify. I only know I paid way too much for the service I received which was mediocre at best. I will never return to this establishment.,1
"Dick's Hideaway is definitely hidden, but once you find it, you will enjoy it. Stopped in for breakfast and had the combo Benedict pork and beef with jalapeno Hollandiase it was excellent just the right amount of kick. If you want something spicier they have plenty of items on the menu with red and green chili. The waitress was helpful, friendly and attentive. Breakfast with a kick and a smile.",2
"This place was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't even bother trying. There was a line wrapped around the lobby of the Mirage, and I figured why not. Big mistake. It's way over priced, the bartenders are horrible, the music is from like 4 years ago, no where to dance, and the B Team is perched on the stripper poles. Unless you want to people watch, then try somewhere else.",1
"This is somewhat of a small stadium, but very nice for watching basketball. It is very clean and modern in its design. The view is excellent from anywhere in the stadium. There are ample concessions and restrooms located around the concourse. Just watch out for the idiots throwing things and drunkenly punching each other up in the student section.",2
"Great place to get a smog check for your vehicle. I came here on a Tuesday at 4 30 pm. I was done in less than 3 minutes. I mentioned that I saw them on Yelp and got the 2.00 discount, making the cost of the smog check 16.99. I had Luis do my inspection and he was great. very fast and very pleasant. This is my new go to place for smog checks from now on.",2
"I walked in with a group of 7. It was this gays turn to show the co workers a night outside the Scottsdale scene. They rejected us because one of our girls had a purse ""bigger than a clutch. "" It cost us 60 in cab fare to get there, and they wouldn't budge, even after we emptied the purses. So we hoped into a cab and had a great night at Amsterdam.",1
"China Joe's is below average. I placed an order for delivery. They were late, the soup had spilled out into the delivery bag, and they delivered the wrong food item to my roommate. Also, they charge a dollar extra for shrimp lo mein and I got 4 shrimp. Come on! I don't believe I will be ordering from them again.",1
The food here is amazing the quality for the price is great as is the service. But their student discount only applies to ASU students. This ridiculous rivalry between A ASU Phoenix and U of A Tucson has got to stop. This business should be above that I expect better off this awesome local restaurant. I gotta say this has left a bad taste in my mouth.,2
I'm not sure what all the fuss is about this place but I can honestly say the best part of the food was the pita my gyro meat was cold and the fries were not seasoned. The chicken souvlaki was okay but tasted like it was old. The salad was just plain with some feta cheese and dressing plus this was kinda expensive. You do get a lot of food for the price but you won't eat most of it,1
"I got the beefless burger with cheese, gaucamole, lettus, and a side of sweet potatoe fries with a tab of 11.01. Really? The fries had a weird taste to them and an even worst after taste. The burger I could not taste the gaucamole and took apart my burger to make sure it was on it. Not worth the price in my opinion.",1
"The best show in vegas, period. Terry has more talent in his pinky than most performers have in their entire bodies. He has so much charisma, and humility it's amazing to see. I took my wife and mother in law to see the show, and we were grins throughout the entire performance. Would highly recommend to anyone who is willing to let go and have a good time.",2
Bed Bugs! Stayed here to break in the New Year and got attacked by Bed Bugs! The stuff the front desk managers made us go through to get us out of the room was very unprofessional! They sent our clothes out to get cleaned and we waited over 24 hours to get them back. Nothing like spending your New Years Eve in a room infested with Bed Bugs!,1
A good place to go when you want a change of taste from Maxim. Pho Thanh's serving size and taste was excellent. The staff was friendly and prompt. We had the noodle soup and spring rolls and both were excellent. Only negative was my vietnamese drip coffee took forever to drip but such is the woe of life.,2
I wish that I could give this ZERO stars because that is what it deserves. I actually just walked out of the show about half an hour ago. I couldn't bear to sit through any more of that crap. I literally had my mouth hanging open b c I could not believe how BAD it was. I was also baffled that everyone around me seemed to be enjoying it. I want my money and my life back!,1
"I hope this business burns in a thousand flames in the seven hells. two hour wait time for shuttle at the pick up point to go to EDC, two hours in traffic. They got these shitty party buses that fit like 10 people each. for the ride back to the hotel room, the buses never came and we thought we got scammed. OH that's right. we did get scammed. Shitty, awful service. Do not buy ever.",1
"This particular sprouts market used to be the local sunflower market. I'm very happy it was converted into a sprouts, since now I don't have to drive down to the paradise valley location! I also enjoy this location because its never overly busy. I don't have to wait forever in line. The store is very clean and easily layed out. The prices are good and shopping here helps support local farmers",2
"Quite possibly THE BEST Mexican Cuisine in Las Vegas! My favorite spot for sure! The staff is wonderful, the food comes out quick, hot, delicious, and AUTHENTIC. Being from Spanish decent, everything I have tried on the menu, so far, has impressed me! Being from out of town, I always stop by this place when I'm in Vegas. See you tomorrow ",2
"Everyone there were really nice. Always helpful, from beginning to the end. There were regulars and a couple of newbies just like us that have never done archery but everyone had a very welcoming mood. As far are as the facility, really clean and well lit. Got a good deal off of yelp but even without the deal it's still worth to check out. Can't wait to go back.",2
"For a lonely foreign boy needing a good cry, the vindaloo had me bawling like a baby. It's been 10 years 1998 since I've been back, but it was a reliable go to throughout that rainy, gray summer. It also gave me a little cachet when passing judgment on the subcontinental food out west. I mean, who's gonna go to South Queensferry, Scotland to challenge my credibility? Nobody, that's who.",2
"I wrote to the corporate office about my experience, and they told me they were sorry, and that they forwarded my message to the manager for follow up. Needless to say, there has been ZERO followup. I have received no response, and plan to inform corporate of this again. There is nothing more detrimental to a business than management who has no interest in resolving a legitimate issue.",1
"Mmmm, Steerburger. The Prime burger is a seriously good burger. For less than 5. The trio with fries and drink is like 8.50. Satisfies my craving for beef, bacon, and cheese, and doesn't come close to breaking the bank, so I'm a happy girl. Get the trio, die happy and go to cholesterol heaven. Just ignore the dumpy ""classic "" 1970s decor.",2
"Got a ham, egg and cheese on jalape u00f1os bagel. It was surprisingly good. Bagel was baked fresh and had a nice chewy texture. Ham, egg and cheese were good. At least they looked fresh, non greasy and real not like the fake stuff at some other fast food joints. It's 6 for a breakfast bagel. Maybe it's a bit overpriced but then it's a fair price for an airport.",2
"I waited 3 hours for this buffet and when we were finally in, all we really ate was the crab legs. They are not stingy with those legs. They kept refilling it when it ran out. The service was ok, they were really busy so it took awhile for our waiter to bring us our refills. We didn't even get to try the free alcohols! Would i come back? It all depends on how long the line is.",1
"The strip has so much terrible food and terrible drinks for SO much money. My wife and I stopped here and good old Chipotle was better than every other meal we had over the course of a week with the exception of Fleur de lys. So for the record Fleur de lys 1, Chipotle 2, and everywhere else isn't worth the effort.",2
"I went in so excited because I've never been in one of these stores before and I love golf. We'll let me tell you, I practically had to beg people to help me. Maybe it's because I wasn't buying anything. I had lots of questions but only wound up asking a few because I didn't want to feel like a nuisance. I'll be shopping at Dicks from now. They're way more helpful and a lot friendlier.",1
"This place is an absolute gem! I so wish we had one in Portland! The vegan wings are so so so so so so so good! You have to try them. wing lovers will unite on this sensational menu item. We also tried two of the bowls.both of which are outstanding. If you're looking for a great vegan, gluten free joint. that's casual and tasty. this is so your place.",2
"I had my van wrapped with Artkore and I was very impressed with their creativity. I told them what I wanted it to look like and they came up with some great design. Wow, I was impressed! The whole experience was amazing. The owner Rassiel was so helpful throughout the process. At the end my van turned out great. Thank you so much Artkore.",2
"I am a fan. The cheeseburgers are fantastic, the beer is super cold, and the service is reasonable. The atmosphere is bright and open with plenty of TVs and a large patio. The location is also superb with countless nightlife options within walking distance. Ice buckets built into the tables is a neat idea.",2
Great seafood chioppino. Also tried my wife's grilled sea bass and my high roller buddy's rack of lamb awesome. What surprised me was the pizza and spaghetti with meat sauce was that they whipped up for our kids delicious. I was surprised how accommodating they were to our families despite their high brow reputation.,2
"This is a great place to go and get full on some pizza, particularly after a cold evening of enjoying the bars and tromping around in the snow. You'll read about the creative pizzas they have Mac'n'Cheese . It is a bit crazy with drunken university students, but if you get past that bit, it's an enjoyable and warm stop on the way home!",2
"BEWARE, If you contact this company to get a quote and then decide not to use their services the CEO will continue to harass you. I asked her to stop emailing me because we no longer needed services and were sent two nasty emails from her. How professional to argue with a client through email, don't waste your time. She has a bad attitude!",1
"Bland franchise with a terrible uni color scheme and brutal logo. Other than the one season Jake Delhomme did not play like the mediocre QB he is, that's it. I defy anyone outside of Carolina to name a player on the Panthers. Julius Peppers does not count as he just left. I do love one thing Coach Fox likes to call the onside kick at the most unlikely times and they often work.",1
"I drop by this Chevron from time to time. It gets very busy during the daytime. I used to come here more frequently, but I find that sometimes they're out of premium unleaded, but I don't know until I pull up to the pump and see a little note on the pump. That irritates me. However, when I need gas and I'm in the area, I have no choice. Return Factor 50 ",1
"Poor service food took a significant amount of time to come out, waiters mixed up numerous orders, and then also had trouble splitting the bill. Pho was also one of the worst I've had. The meat was not fresh and was gummy after cooking in the soup. Noodles were hard and undercooked. Avoid this place if you're looking for pho.",1
"The food here is fantastic and the pita bread is my absolute favorite. Unfortunately, I've been back several times and the service is always unbearably slow. If you have to get back to the office during lunchtime, I'd go elsewhere. Otherwise, relax and enjoy the grub! I highly recommend the lentil soup!",2
"First time here at Detroit Coney Grill. Here's my review. Service 5 5 the staff is VERY friendly and accommodating, everyone went out of their way to greet us and make us feel welcomed. Food 4 5 my mom got the gyro and I got a coney no onion, and we shared fries. The hotdog really does have a great snap to it. Fries are hand cut and fresh. Great neighborhood spot, will come back again.",2
"The food here is decent, but nothing special when it comes to Chinese take out. I will say there are other places nearby that are much better. The portions are pretty small, and sauces are bland. The owners are usually pretty nice when I go. The only reason I will come here is really for the convenience factor of it being in Harris Teeter. Other than that, I would not recommend.",1
This bar is shite for so many reasons. we' ll start off with the horrible bartenders especially the broad with the stupid haircut. Then we'll talk about the bad late night food choices. Then we'll talk about how I just had a cucumber martini at Caramel for 14 dollars and you charge me 20 for the same thing. F you guys.,1
"I thought I'd be in trouble for trying a place that has happy hour all the time. Who would've known that fresh nigri, sashimi and rolls would follow the reasonable prices? Soup, salad and breadsticks. oops, I meant dessert, with your meal n Don't puss out when you sit outside without misters n Go for the healthier sake instead of Sopporo big gulps",2
I hate when people give 1 star reviews. And you see they only have written 1 review. I go here all the time to get a cheap haircut. I don't walk in expecting a 50 min haircut resulting in a masterpeice. I want to get in. Get out. Get cleaned up with something easy to manage for cheap. The staff is friendly to me. I get what I want at a price that doesn't make me pissed. Boom.,2
"I like most of the food here. We've been 3 or 4 times. I love the guacomole, but I will say some of my favorite mexican food options aren't on the menu. Prices are kinda high and service is hit or miss. I've definitely had better Mexican food, but we've obviously been back more than once. so overall, good food.",2
"I called them to see if they wanted to buy some gently used furniture that was in very good shape. I text the buyer some photos and he offered me 50 75 for EVERYTHING! What a joke! Even Terri's Consign which also do not pay very well and another buyer offered me twice that, though it was still pennies on the dollar. Never calling these folks again.",1
"Idiot! I reserved my trip online, when I did not receive a price I called. The idiot woman who answered could not confirm my trip, she did not speak well English, told me my trip would be 33, I had to give her my information over and over and over then she told me my trip would be 100. I told her not to set the trip, not to send a cab and hung up on her. Idiots should not be on the phone.",1
"In the top 5 hotels I have ever had the pleasure to stay in. Beautiful common rooms, fantastic service and amenities and nice views, albeit at a price that does explain this. Very clean, spacious and tastefully decorated rooms. Stayed for one night only, however I was extremely impressed. I strongly recommend to visit if you can get a deal, otherwise the 250 room price is pricey.",2
Probably the worst dining experience I can remember. The food was average at best and the service was essentially non existent. The couple next to us sat for 10 minutes waiting for their check. The waitress never brought the beer we ordered but still tried to charge us for it. Average sushi and bad service. There are plenty of other good sushi places in Vegas so don't waste your time at Ra.,1
"My first time to visit, and I hit a GREAT sale. 4 pairs of shoes for 75, and all of the shoes are very stylish. One of the employees, Brian, was very helpful! When a shoe was a little loose, he simply added some padding and the shoe fit just right. I am glad I discovered this place, and will definitely go again. Great prices, great customer service.",2
The reason for this one star review is because there is NO possibility of sleep at this hotel on the weekends and they simply don't care. It is 3 23AM as I write this with front desk informing me it will last till 4 00 AM. nLike many who come here for conventions this is deeply disturbing when one must get up early for work and to pay high Vegas rates for a top property.,1
Very authentic canto food! Reminds me of the street food vendors in Hong Kong! All three dishes we got were phenomenal! Free delicious soup after you place your order! I would actually pay to get the soup since it's that delicious. I didn't taste much of MSG which is always a plus at Chinese restaurants!,2
"This isn't a review on the hotel itself but rather their buffet. You can get breakfast for 6.50 or brunch for 9.50 when you get their club card. The buffet is just awesome. I've been to a lot of buffet's on the strip and this place is topping most of them because of the price food quality ratio. Just come here early, because it gets packed later!",2
"From the Big Star to the Casanova, Federal pizza is not f ckin' around. Crust perfectly thin and crispy. Toppings top notch and distributed evenly. Cheese a solid reason to get up in the morning. Overall bring it all on, 'cause I'm going to finish it before I roll outta this biznitch. Leftovers are for the weak when you're dealing with pizza this rightfully grandiose.",2
" ""Love This Arena! "" nI have been to plenty of boxing matches as well as concerts! I'd say the best concert I went and saw here had to be the Mrs. Carter Tour! Beyonce KILLED the stage at the MGM Grand Arena! I I always suggest that if the concert you are going to is here to also stay at the hotel as well! Makes the commute so much more eaiser! The food inside is expensive as you know what though!",2
I really like this location much better than the one I previously visited in Mesa on Iron Ave. This location is well lit w natural lighting streaming in and it seems as if the food even tastes better. We enjoyed our meal and our waitress was very attentive. I plan to visit this location in the near future!,2
"I've been through better but this one aint bad. I love the smell of airports too. It reminds me of going somewhere fun. At least it does since I don't travel for work anymore. Sky Harbor has the average food choices, has been decently upgraded, parking is OK. I really don't have much to complain about.",2
"Took my kids here tonight. We wanted to see Magamind Great movie. But the theater was so nasty there was food everywhere in the theater. Left over candy boxes the bathroom was disgusting. That will be the last time we over go there So if you wan to be in a nasty, disgusting theater this is the place for you ",1
"Jime rocks. Didn't know about this place at all, but saw it walking by. Decided to get a tattoo and went for it. Jime drew up a sketch quick and then had me out of there in about an hour. Amazing experience and amazing tattoo. I wish our tattoo places in my city were as accommodating. Next time I'm in Vegas, Jime is my ""go to "" artist.",2
"Used to be decent, pretty much sucks now. Literally probably the most expensive bar in Bloomfield. For some reason their drafts are way over priced and taste awful. The place is kinda a dump too and looks terrible from the outside. Men's bathroom reeks and is just filthy. I probably won't go here again.",1
"Wonderful family owned restaurant. Good food, good service, relaxing atmosphere. Mondays were a little slower than other nights so this became my dinner, class prep, read, grade papers spot. I loved the turkish coffee and chatting with the fam. They're also apart of American Airlines and US Airways dining advantage club.",2
"This buffet was recommended to us by one of our cabbies when we asked him where the locals go for a good valued buffet. Since it was about 10 minutes away from our hotel, we took his advice and decided to give it a try. The food was edible from what I can remember, but most buffets are mediocre. I don't remember exactly how much we paid per person, but it was definitely under 20.",1
Solid shoe repair business without anything fancy. Good for a resole on those boots you love. Shoe repair seems to be a lost art in these parts and many parts for that matter. Guess people buy cheap shoes and toss em when their done? A good pair of shoes fits like a glove of the foot so why not fix them? Anyway I am glad that this place is around.,2
My friend was a 1st time Thai Food person and this was perfect for that. The flavors were on point and everything had just the right amount of spice. A few of the yelp reviews weren't that good but I ignored them. One review was spot on that said the Pad Thai didn't have enough noddles but lots of everything else and he was right. Next time i'm in Vegas I'll def go back.,2
Small club with a line outside and the cover is too high. There was a wait outside but when we got in the club was probably half full. I know a lot of places do this but it is definitely annoying. Music was good if you like new and old school hip hop. I'd consider this a mid to low level club now compared to the rest.,1
"Came here on Saturday night with a party of 8. We booked our reservation on Open Table and waited less than 10 minutes for our table. I ordered a root beer vodka soda and steak sandwich which was really good. One of the other girls ordered the french onion soup and a salad which looked even better. This place is really cute and has a great view, great for a fun, affordable dinner.",2
"The best Spanish food and margaritas I have ever had! The atmosphere is very fun, reasonable prices, creative flare of Spanish dishes that are to die for. I had the cheese crisps large Mexican pizza and want to go back already! The service and staff are just the lime on the perfect margarita to a fabulous dining experience!",2
"Stopped in to grab a warm caffeine fix before standing outside in the cool air at one of the kids' functions. Nice atmosphere with a lot of patrons utilizing the free wi fi. The new Thanksgiving blend was smooth and piping hot, as a good cup of joe should be. Like Paul W. Yelped previously, parking is a little tight. The service was fast and friendly.",2
Really? At an airport? Who would ever expect to get real restaurant quality food at an airport. This is not chili's this is go out to dinner fine food. I had swordfish tacos. A full swordfish filet comes out with all the fixings. Green beans were crisp and tasty. Servers were all friendly. Good job!,2
"A regular here, this is a lovely bar great ambience, good staff and the best glass of chilled white wine you will get. How nice to get a nice cool glass spritzers are good too! Food is also top quality! It does get a certain type of clientele from the Stockbridge area, but, hey! I live round the corner so why complain I suppose I am a Stockbridgiaow! ",2
"This place was great the environment and service were awesome! The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I thought the ceviche tasting was small. I also got the ""lomo satado "" which is stir fry iron steak which was unbelievable! The steak was tender, marinated, and delicious. Overall good experience",2
"I thoroughly enjoyed creating my own pizza combo. I loved the egg on top, however failed to ask for it sunny side up so it was basically a fried egg topping. The flavor was there though and I ate almost the entire pizza by myself. The canollis that came free with the yelp checkin were honestly the best I've had. The service was ok.",2
"Poppa Maize Gourmet Popcorn is incredible! Not only do they have a billion flavors to choose from, they are SO NICE! I work in events and they have sponsored events for The Boys Girls Clubs of the East Valley as well as The Leukemia Lymphoma Society. I also know they do several charity events a month! What a wonderful and super tasty! addition to our community!",2
"Un p'tit coin de paradis aux couleurs acidul u00e9es qui rappellent les tendres souvenirs de l' enfance. Des pops artisanaux aux gouts surprenants et aux couleurs originales.

Very good burger. The milkshake was freaking amazing! Ramsay made a nice place. Staff is very professional and the atmosphere is trendy. Price is around 10 per burger and if you have a slot membership card you can get a buck off which is worth while to get since it is free and you can use it other places.,2
"Great bacon! Really good food, good portions, and great service. and the bacon! They have a pretty nice breakfast and lunch assortment and fantastic bacon. The prices are decent for the portion size. I'm gonna have to read through this review to see if I've mentioned the BACON. Anyways, when you go, be sure to get ya some bacon. enjoy.",2
"Zipps is your place to go to drink beer, eat bar food, and or watch a game with friends n. nZipps is NOT your place to go if you want to drink craft beer, eat classy food , and or watch Oprah with a date. It's a sports bar people. Wings are awesome love the golden style and getting a bucket of 5 domestic beers for 12 is all I need to watch the Cardinals lose a game they should have one.",2
"This has been my best eggs Benedict experience in Phoenix. After having a 20 minute conversation with my brother about how badly people destroy hollandaise sauce, Surprise surprise! Their sauce was the perfect consistency. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Presentation with the fingerling potatoes was beautiful. This is as good as it gets.",2
"Very long and narrow kind of 2 1 2 stories with a small stage in the middle. Not a great venue for seeing concerts due to the small size unless the artists are really unpopular . As a bar, it seems like a fine place with the exception that they still allow smoking. The food was pretty horrible, but they have a decent selection of draft beers.",1
I have order about have the menu. This place is very good. The chicken katsu and the misubi is delicious. I did order the orange chicken and the only critique is not to use to much garlic it orange chicken after all not garlic chicken and the garlic does need to be cooked so it doesn't over power the dish. And the lumpia needs to be fried with very hot oil so it doesn't come out to greasy oily.,2
I went there last night! Everything tasted amazing! I got the egg plant sandwiches with an artichoke W a cider. My boyfriend got the cowboy! We both loved it. But from looking these pictures I need to go back for breakfast dessert! I love the atmosphere. It's not to loud it's hair perfect. For either a date night or a evening night out. Only negative is they don't carry sour beer.,2
"I love this place. It's a drive from my house but so worth it. I'm a fan of Pepsi products and they serve Pepsi. The popcorn is FANTASTIC! I love the butter topping they use. The prices are good as far as movie prices go. The theatres are in good shape, good sound quality. And did I mention the popcorn was awesome?",2
"I was a tourist who did not realize this was a canadian american style chinese restaurant, I saw roast pork on rice and thought it was hong kong style. it wasnt. i think the kitchen started to make roast pork fried rice and tossed it once i clarified what i wanted. they still dumped a bunch of corn starchy veggies on it. it was not what i wanted but it didn't taste that bad and was cheap.",1
"Stopped by for a quick lunch, nService was great, nice, professional courteous, nFood was delicious, I love thai curry, and I tried dozens of thai places all around the US, this is one of the best curries I had! nprices are very affordable and they also deliver. ngood, simple place, delicious food. nWill be back for sure!",2
"We loved this place so much, we came back three times on vacation. Love the indoor and outdoor bar. We enjoyed chatting with different staff each time and also the outdoor fireplace sorta object . Also, drinks are average in price, but 2 out of 3 times we had the special cocktail of the day and it was delightful and reasonable.",2
"Sammy was excellent! She helped me quickly, with a pleasant smile great attitude. My bank sent me to a different MVD 3rd party processor who proved incapable of processing my rather simple auto title transfer. I researched ASAP online and thought they sounded more competent and capable. That proved to be the case. Avoid the MVD lines, visit these fine folks!",2
"I've had a lot of coffee in my day so when I went into this place, I wasn't expecting anything special. I can honestly say that it's one of the best coffee places I have ever been to. I've gone a couple of times and always order something different and each time I try something new, the first sip always blows me away. If you haven't already tried this place, it's a must!",2
"I love this place! Wonderfully unique pieces, helpful and informative staff and reasonable prices, given the quality and history behind these items. I hope to get over there at least weekly so I won't miss out oew items as they come in. Each time I go back I see something new! It is so spacious, it may take you a couple of trips to see everything!",2
Having 20 beers on tap to choose from and countless wines is always a plus in my world. Having a bar close to where my husband gets his hair cut is another plus. nPick up a snack and maybe a meal grab a beer or wine pick your poison and grab a seat. Staff is knowledgable and friendly and people watching is a ten here.,2
"This spot is a great atmosphere with inspired creations that will tickle your taste buds. Portion sizes are a little small for the big eater, but everything we tried was delicious. Highly recommend the shishito peppers as well as the shrimp and lobster dish. Service was outstanding. Be prepared to spend 100 per person for a full meal and drinks. Great dining experience !",2
"Lgo.lgo.l.g.ooooooooo! This place is always amazing. The pizza is always great.amazing burgers and salads as well. the grocery store is attached next door and is a great place to pick up your favorite drink, Tammie coe cupcake, or small gift. Also a great breakfast! One of the easiest 5 star reviews.",2
"Finally found my favorite dry cleaning store in town. Price is reasonable, and service is far better than more pricey ones. They don't ship your clothes to other warehouses. All the cleaning is done within the store, so it's faster and adds more personal touch. There are several mom and pops around town, but this one seems to run independently Lake Mead and Buffalo location . Love them!",2
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! Pizza is sooo good. A friend of mine took me here for the first time and I have been hooked ever since. Great food and really friendly staff. The only thing I don't like is that the whole restaurant shares one bathroom. me being a germ a phob lol. But the pizza is soo awesome. I normally like to get the pizza with extra suace on top. Sooo delicious.",2
"I couldn't finish my meal, it was awful. The meat was dry, the sauce was bitter, and the food over all was very oily. I tried the Greek fries, which was a terrible idea. Soggy, cold, and terrible. The feta cheese was even bad, which is pretty difficult to accomplish. I wouldn't recommend this place to my enemies.",1
"Lunch was bought grateful and I was given the Lobster seafood salad sandwich. I did not enjoy at all, gave it up after the first bite and come to find out ,there is only 9 of lobster in the mix from what I found out on the internet and the other 91 is hotdog seafood. I Will never eat or think about this sandwich again. Gotta have the real 100 lobster roll next time.",1
"Love AZ Auto Doctor for they have been servicing our two Hondas since 1995. Ryan is very knowledgeable and knows his stuff. Great customer service, honest and affordable. Have gotten the whole family to go to AZ Auto Doctor since we all drive Hondas. If you want the job done right, don't hesitate on taking your vehicle over to them. Thanks Ryan and guys for taking care of our cars.",2
"Love the food, especially the fries where it's peeled and cut daily, never frozen potatoes. Everything is so perfect here and up to you on what you want and don't want on your burgers. It gets super busy lunch and dinner time, so be ready to wait up to 10 minutes for your food after you order. Must try!",2
"I was so intrigued by this place.alcohol and ice cream combined. I figured you couldn't go wrong and boy, was I right! The champagne infused ice cream was delicious. I also tasted the strawberry daiquiri rum and was totally impressed. This little gem is hidden across from Southbridge and it is certainly worth the trip!",2
"Service was PAINFULLY slow. Took 30 minutes for 2 paninis. I mean really? We saw that they were preparing everyone else's bagel orders before they finally got around to making our panini. When we checked our bag in the car, we found that the lady gave us the wrong order of chips. Incredibly disappointed with the service here. Won't be returning",1
"I love these guys! Pizza is wonderful, owners are very community oriented. The owner shared on my last visit that the new parking meter rules downtown actually make visiting easier as US Airways event owners cao longer tie up spaces for the night. So if that kept you from stopping in.give it another shot! You won't be disappointed!",2
"Well the sushi is great! I get sushi from Mandarin about 3 times a week. It is by far the best sushi in the city. As for the food? Yeah there are better places in CHINA. I can only imagine what these people say about ""TYPICAL "" Chinese places because this is GREAT compared to other Chinese restaurants.",2
I definitely see the potential as far as the bowling and drinks. But when it comes to food to price. HORRIBLE. We ordered the calamari which was 14.50 to our waiters advice and hand motion the portion size was decently large. WRONG! The burger and fries were decent also but definitely NOT. Worth the price.,1
I like this place. Don't need to worry about sticky table or greasy floors. It's clean here and food is great. I've tried the Pho combo and Vermecilli noodle with egg roll and pork. I've been here a few times when driving to Vegas. nIt's about 10 mins off the strip. Some authentic Vietnamese food. I'd definitely return here again.,2
"Not your typical hard sale dealership. Instead, friendly and knowledgable staff. I bought a 2013 Outback in November. Keenan, the salesman, was very helpful. Nice service center, excellent beverage bar including coffee , and a clean showroom. Parts and service staff available and courteous. Able to negotiate a decent deal.",2
"Went into Raw Food Cafe today to get a juice and I was denied. The door was open, people were in there, I saw the veggies. But when I went to the counter the girl said ""no "" the air conditioning was out and they were going to close. I don't think it would have been a big deal to throw some veg into the juicer, but she preferred to turn away a customer. I probably will not go back.",1
"I've been going here off and on for a long time now. This place is by far the best place to spin in the city. The instructors are all great and the space is first rate. The hour classes really fly by. Generally my 160lb frame can burn anywhere between 650 800 calories in that time. The bikes are nicely leveled and placed on mats so they don't ""walk "" too. All that and complimentary towels too.",2
"Do not come here if you are looking for a luxurious place to stay! This is NOT the place for you if you wanted something luxurious. I got a room at the Skyrise tower, the only word I can use to describe the room is it SUCKED! First of all the hallway smelled like weed, the room smells bad, and it is dusty. This is first and last time, you'll see me there.",1
OMG the blue cheese honey! So damn good. While we usually go to wholefoods for our filling of S.R. we went up to scottsdale to hit the store. Thing the ice cream is a little different at the store then at wholefoods. Must be the temp and freshness. I recommend this ice cream to anyone that love to try new funky lovers. Is say its on par with Double Rainbow from San Francisco,2
"We love it here! This is our go to when we are craving a near by sushi place. The sushi is very good and the service is awesome. For me, the only downside is the take out. I picked up for take out twice, and each time my portions for the teriyaki were cut in half yet the dish was the same price . Other than that, great place.",2
"In days of yore, a trip wasn't complete without a visit to Binion's for the bean soup, but much gas has been passed since our last visit. We each ordered a bowl of this day's black eyed bean and ham soup that was accompanied by a generous portion of corn bread. The soup was under seasoned and the corn bread was dry due to over baking, so much for nostalgia.",1
"This is a value given the surroundings and is the best place to stay for anything happening on the stripe. Keep in mind this Best Western DOES NOT recognize you as business traveler "" Diamond "" level and DOES NOT do breakfast. n nThe Hotel is clean but not easy to get to with either a shuttle or taxi. Remember this Best Western is like the other Plus location.",1
Well I am a BBQ fan I've gone to Shane's for several years. It is ok but not great. Service is often poor and sides are ofteot warm enough. Last Wednesday I tried it again. I ordered a simply Big Dad Sandwich. I sat down in a nearly empty dinning room After 25 minutes I decided to give up. No food or acknowledgment. I left and will not go back again.,1
Mediocre. That sums about everything up. Service was Ok. Ambiance was poor. Food was bland. Sushi was pretty meh. I sat in the non teppanyaki side but frankly I don't see how that would change the food. It shouldn't matter who cooks it. The reviews for this place are suspiciously high so may want to take that into consideration before you come here.,1
"This is the best authentic Mexican food in Charlotte! I love the grilled chicken salad, fresh guacamole, carnitas tacos, and low carb margarita. The bartender Fabiola is awesome, we always sit at the bar bc she is fun! The owner is also very friendly, had a great conversation with him about food and his home in Mexico City. Love Love Love this place!",2
"Stopped here to grab some Bachelorette favors, games and decorations. This store is pretty cool. They have all kinds of adult stuff. Clothing, costumes, toys, everything! The guy that helped us was really cool I wish I remembered his name and knowledgeable. He talked to us girls for a long time about all the different sex toys. It was informative to say the least.",2
"FREAKING DELICIOUS! nAwesome bite size fine dining. AND Great Mimosas! Group of 10, 50ish for brunch on Saturday per person. nTotally worth it. Gelato flavors up to 20, bite size desserts. Cant' even describe it. but it's HANDS DOWN, the best buffet in town! Going agaiext time! Didn't eat again all day I'M IN LOVE!",2
"I get the 66 or 71 same as the 66 but comes with an egg roll flavorful charcoal grilled pork with a nice array of vegitables and peanuts over vermicelli noodles. Today I am getting the 71 for lunch. Oh, and their Pho is delicious I like it with the softened tendons. What can I say, I like visceral meats.",2
"My son and I like to take our cars here for the very inexpensive wash. It is a ""touch less "" wash that comes with a FREE vacuum after the fact. Can't really beat the price of 6.00 for the basic, and up to 10.00 for additional services. nI don't find the extra 4.00 worth any of the services that they offer for that money.",2
"I wish this place had a drive through but service is always quick and pleasant so I don't mind going in. The outdoor area is so charming. They never get the drinks wrong. I can't say enough good things about the service in particular there is one dark haired woman that is so sweet, she makes me smile every time I go in.",2
"La Bocca is a cute place to go on a date night or ladies night. The atmosphere is great, with the dimmed lights and city vibe. The bruschetta is great paired with their red sangria! The pear salad and any of the pizzas are great as well. I love that this place is easy to walk in and sit down and order without much of a hassle.",2
"Great variety of fresh tasting meals. The Mediterranean chicken salad is my fav. The philly cheese pita and the wood fired chicken lavosh are also favorites. The tea is great too. Strawberry kiwi green tea and passion black tea. When I'm in the mood for a beer they have my favorite local craft, four peaks kiltlifter, yum!",2
"Cafe Krishna has always been a regular destination for me. Along with the food the staff was very friendly. Now, all the old staff has gone and the new staff as hard as they are trying it isn't working. The food is not what it use to be. I hope to come by again and see that they have found their lost spark. Cold food, hard idli, watery sambar chutney.",1
"If I need to sit down and talk to someone in the branch, this location and the one on Village Center are the ones I prefer. There is plenty of space and they have private dividers so other customers don't have to ability to be as nosy. The location is convenient. There is a ATM inside or plenty of tellers on hand to help you inside. I wish I could say more but that about sums it up lol.",2
Phew! Another coffee review in Pittsburgh. People in Pittsburgh like to be caffeinated ! Located at the corner of the street with a cute sit out area serving good types of coffee and sandwiches and biscotti.I am a great fan of pittsburgh coffee and biscotti's. Apparently Pittsburgh has kept up with my expectations. Smriti,2
"Good deal on the rooms nFood Cafe Food was Ok but what can u expect. nCasino Good cheap slots, The waitress I waited almost 1 hour before I saw some one shitty attitude shitty service. You ask them for a drink and all you get is a snarl and look.would i stay there again ? Yea but will i gamble there HELL NO! yout better off at the Fremont",1
"Been coming here for years, and finally decided to write a review. Long overdue. Sushi Kee has never failed me. The menu won't disappoint, the chefs are outstanding, and the ""all you can eat "" special for 20 bucks brings the whole thing together. After trying almost every other sushi bar in town, I always head back to the Kee.",2
"They ran a LIVING SOCIAL deal. Six phone calls to them to schedule. No answer, no return call. Scheduled the cleaning online as their phone message states NO SHOW nThis business can't handle the business they already have STEER CLEAR. nDon't waste you money on their LIVING SOCIAL deal. They are a rip off. nDON'T USE THIS BUSINESS!",1
They snaked our drain and charged about 90. This also included replacing a washer on an outdoor hose faucet. They came when they said they would and called when they were on the way. This company has a real person answering the phone to take down your information which makes it easy and efficient to schedule an appt. I am a fan.,2
"Our soccer team stayed here for the second year in a row and it's only gotten better. This place is clean, affordable, easy to get to, with incredibly COMFORTABLE BEDS and nice decor throughout. The staff is great friendly and very helpful. They've added a free breakfast buffet this year which makes it even better. Stay here! It's great.",2
Had groupon for shellac manicure and it was awful! It started peeling after less than a week and chipped within the first day for no reason since I don't do much with my nails or hands. Service was also terrible. It was a rainy day and they were empty but they still rushed me and did a sloppy job. Do not go here!,1
"The restaurant is beautiful and my friends and I were immediately impressed. It's a shame the service was so horrible. For a party of 5 we were served our meal at 3 different times. First 1 persons order, 4 minutes later 2 more, and the last 2 got their food 15 minutes later. Drink orders were wrong. Food was cold. Generally all around awful experience. Would not recommend again.",1
Currently still in drive thru line for 30 minutes. No. Joke. Can't exit and blocked in from cars in the front and rear. I'm too tempted to drive over the nice gardening next to the drive thru lane. The only thing keeping me sane is killing time writing this review. As I reach the end if typing this not one car has moved forward. I'm gonna drive thru this gardening.,1
"Was going to go her to have a late dinner after coming back from the mountains. Saw a ""B "" sanitation grade on the door. Looked it up online and the score was 82. If you serve sushi, you should have no less than a 95 under any circumstances. They have scored well in the past, so hopefully this is a fluke. If they improve consistently, I'll be back and will update this.",1
"Nice pools. Buffet is very affordable and high in quality. The location is what lost it a star. Far from the strip, near red rock hiking. But, if you came to vegas to hike you really don't know how to hike. The many pools here make this place rock. It was sad that pool closed at 3pm on Saturday due to a concert and normally closes at 6pm. Also sad, no late check out. Gone by 11a.",2
This office exceeds expectations in every sense of the word. They were great all around. My foster soeeded a lot of dental work. They were quick and great. The doctors made him feel special and helped keep him calm and relaxed during the visits. The front office ladies are sweet as can be and helpful. I would make the drive wherever you are for this office.,2
"This is the best Italian restaurant we've been to in Phx. It blows away the chain competition and does it in a nice friendly way. After driving by it for several years we stopped last week, we will be returning often. The flavors were unbelievable, the drinks were excellent and the prices were most reasonable. DON'T miss the desserts.",2
"Neat spot, love taking people who have never been. The patio is great, love that they have board games and the frost rail is neat. Great beer selection and prices. I didnt eat this trip but have before and it was eh, seems the food always takes a very long amount of time to come out even when they are not busy.",2
"Very laid back spot right off of Roosevelt. Good selection of beer and the prices are pretty on point. The only real downside for me is having live music, which I'm sure is a positive for most people, it just makes it a little harder to have a conversation. But if you're looking to check out new music, it's worth it.",2
"Tiny little pieces of fish that seemed not much better than something you might find the freezer section of a grocery. Stale tasting chips. Most annoying to my boyfriend, tiny individually packaged tartar sauces obviously not made in house that are incredibly wasteful for a fish and chip joint. Didn't try the coleslaw.",1
"I had high expectations after reading some reviews, but this place didn't live up to the hype. I had the chicken dinner. It was a lot of food, but the quality was horrible. My chicken was 50 skin and fat. If you are looking for a moderately healthy or don't want to give yourself an immediate heart attack dinner go elsewhere. I think the deep fried oreo down the street is better for you.",1
"Absolutely delicious! Ordered cherry glazed, hazelnut crusted chicken. The vegs? They didn't overcook carrots! Yay! My teen ordered avocado chicken sandwich it's BIG and avocado, were ripe and fresh! Nice service! Go. I almost died there. so was my teenager daughter she was picky but she loved her order very much .",2
"RUN AWAY! The older cook stuck his finger in his mouth 2 clear sum food caught in his teeth then stuck his hand in the pasta reservoir to put on someone's plate. We only came here cuz of the overflow Off The Strip. Servers cooks may have been overwhelmed cuz of the heavy business. Plus female server had a martyr complex ""I'm the only one doing stuff. "", ""The owner makes things too chaotic "", etc.",1
The place itself is a little too dark. We were seated upstairs in the back by the window and it was still to dark. There are some lighting on the walls but just didn't do much. I would suggest maybe some candles on the table. Food was ok. Just little too plain for the price. Our server was nice but just little too slow.,1
"Who doesn't love throwing peanut shells on the floor? Not to mention for ""bar food "" this place takes it up a notch. Most recently, I enjoyed a green chile cheese burger which was ginormous! Already a fan of the ruben and the cheesesteak. Plenty of drink specials and TVs for watching games. On my last visit, I noticed they offer live music on weekends. Will have to keep an eye on that.",2
"Burger overcooked, fries undercooked, if you are only doing burgers and fries it needs to be a lot better. Very annoying that you cannot get a glass of water. I liked the theme, the staff is friendly and cute in their uniforms. One time trip for me, I will not go back or recommend. There are too many good burger joints to choose from.",1
"I'm so sorry to give them 2 stars! But, alas, I had to do it. This isn't about the service which is great or the location location, location . Their onions penetrate every facet of the menu. Everything! I just can't stomach it anymore, even after visiting 3 4 times. some of my friends even work here! Anyway, don't come here if you don't like onions or sitting one foot away from the next table.",1
Rule 1 if you dont have money dont go to vegas. They do put up to a 350 HOLD on your cc. Luckily for us it was 59 they were pleasant renting and returning. I lost a bag with 18 worth of valuables. And they searched for it and found it. Excellent people and they try to make you happy. There is 1 con. Midsize sometimes seems compact.,2
"I got a dessert Nutella crepe with strawberries. It was delicious! It looked really nice too. On top of all of this the person working behind the counter was really friendly and nice! I would go there again just because of how nice he was. Since the food was good too, I'll definitely be going there again.",2
"I don't shop here often but have stopped in to pick up race packets from time to time and like how I'm always acknowledged and asked about my running and training. If I lived closer to one of their locations valley wide, I'm certain I'd become regular customer. For those of you that do, I highly recommend Sole Sports Running Zone. Cheers ",2
"Dirty. Floors, tables, waste cans. Salsa bar was watered down and tasteless. Cashier was handling the food with her bare hands patting the burrito shells on the grill and transferring the cooked food to the trays.seriously, this is a health violation. The food was good, but could have been better. I am not overly sensitive, but this was too much.",1
Still recovering from sleepless night 25th floor and the nightclubs rock and throb all the way up all night till 4 30 am. Front desk and management not at all surprised with my complaint. They state many of the rooms hear the clubs all night. Did not know this hotel was designed only for kids. Expected a whole lot more sophistication. Disappointed big time with The Wynn Las Vegas.,1
This hotel is outstanding for those who have been to the strip enough and just want to get away from it all but be close enough to the action! The rooms are modern and very hip! The casino is laid back and chill. I love it here when I am just not into the hustle and bustle of the strip for a weekend! Room service is outstanding and the chocolate covered strawberries are delicious!,2
"Stay away from the egg breakfast sandwiches. The croissant is good. The eggs were WAY undercooked and slimy. For 10, even in Vegas, I expected it to at least be edible. Coffee is meh. Would have liked some flavored creamers, at least. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because their pastries are very good.",1
"Year to year, this is my summer time favorite. Their quality is perfect for a snowball. Just like the ones from New Orleans. nIf you are looking for some great authentic flavors, try the chocolate or the praline topped with condensed milk. My favorite is wedding cake. nAnd the prices are great for a cheap treat when you are leaving Ikea!",2
"We were sitted immediately upon arriving. Our server Ramiro brought us coffee, creamer and water quickly. Our food arrived in a timely matter and exactly as we ordered. We didn't have to ask for any refills Ramiro was on top of it. I was impressed with our experience today especially since it's been a very long time since we visited Ihop.",2
"I'm sorry, but I was very disappointed. Although the decor and atmosphere was very nice, the food was mediocre at best. Tapas portions ranged from minuscule to fair. It just screamed of tourist trap dining. We went to firefly inadvertently the next night and the difference was unbelievable. If you are in the mood for tapas, do yourself a favor and skip Jaleo.",1
This is actually a really good authentic Mexican restaurant. I would reccomend to anyone. Their street tacos are ALMOST as good as real street tacos from the taco stand in the hood lol. If you go you gotta get dessert.! Best fried ice cream I've ever had! Yummy! Great atmosphere. Servers are friendly.,2
"Anyone that has ever been to RC Willey will never go to Walker Furniture. Their stuff is average at best, and even with their 50 off sale, they still did not have anything that came close to the quality and price of the Dining Room table we got at RC. And the salespeople stalk you like a shady used car lot. For that reason alone, we will never be back.",1
"Great Coffee with a personal Touch. I just wanted some standard coffee and Not Just Coffee , was able to deliver with a personal touch. Their standard coffee is custom poured over by the cup. They grind your beans specific to your cup and slowly pour water over it and filter it directly into your cup. If you have never had regular coffee this way, it is pretty great.",2
"It's a movie theatre with comfortable stadium style seats. If you want more comfort, you can grab a blue footstool before you enter your specific theatre! The place is clean and has the requisite stupid high prices for movie snacks, but it's in Town Square which is cool and fun. Thank you to the ticket gal who asked me if I was a student! ",2
"My brother in law took us there for the first time in November! I always wanted to try this place since I saw it on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives! I didn't get to try their famous chili cheese fries, however their burgers are huge and was heaven! We been back once since then but I still have to go back to try their fries! One of my top burger places!",2
"Last Friday for lunch we decided to go to Main Ingredient. OMG, this place has the best BLT in town. I'm not really sure what bacon they used, but it was awesome. So the sandwich had chipotle mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato and the perfect amount of bacon. Normally when I get a BLT from somewhere it only has a couple of pieces of bacon on it. Thanks, Main Ingredient for the best BLT ever. ",2
"Had never been before today. reviews I read indicated good food and bad service. Food was average for me after it took one hour and a half to be served from time of seating. Service was beyond bad. The waiter basically ignored the table once drinks were served and order was taken. A 2 hour lunch is not acceptable. Will not go back, too many good restaurants service wise.",1
I enjoyed the show when he was doing ventriloquism and singing so maybe 1 star is a bit harsh. However I came to Vegas for entertainment not to be preacher to. In the middle of the show Terry breaks out in a religious song about a kid with cancer. Ummmmmm I came to laugh. I didn't come for the God crap or to be manipulated. Want a truly Vegas show? Go see Zoomanity instead.,1
Really 2.5 the store was clean but the selection was very poor. Prices are good if I could find anything. Clothing wise the store had multiples of the same thing. Ross tends to be hit or miss feast or famine. If you have time to kill take a look.dont expect sandwich helpful sales people. Do expect good prices and regularly changing section.,1
"I love the food selection at this place! As someone who spent many years ""across the pond "" I've learned to appreciate good european food. My top foodie recommendations at this store Torani sugar free Black Cherry syrup and CostPlus sparkling water to make your own soda The fondue cheese packs Heinz cream of tomato soup If you try just these 3 things you will glimpse nirvana!",2
"The fake Italian drawl from the server, the crappy free house wine, the mushy lukewarm minestrone soup. The garlic bread that was more buttered than garlic. The fettuccini Alfredo was creamy, but bland, the tastiest thing was the char grilled chicken breast slices. It was a decent amount. However, for 27.95, I'm underwhelmed lol. Oh well!",1
We were trying to choose a new place for lunch at work and this was mentioned. We all LOVED it! that is saying a lot! We ordered off the online menu and I called it in she was VERY friendly it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious! It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often. We will be back!,2
"Ein Bahnhof der unteren Kategorie. H u00e4tte nicht gedacht, dass es solche Bahnhofshallen in einer Stadt wie Karlsruhe noch gibt. Verschmutzt, alt und heruntergekommen. Man sieht schon, dass man versucht hat durch ein entsprechendes Dienstleistungsangebot den Bahnhof aufzuwerten, das kann den schlechten Eindruck allerdings nicht nachhaltig verbessern.",1
"Not a fan! Came here for the Tuesday night 2 bowling special. Walked inside and was informed they are no longer AMF and that the pricing and shoe rental prices were higher. I don't care for the bait and switch. They need to change their name, or remove themselves from the AMF website. We left and went to the AMF at Rural and the 60 where the special was still honored.",1
"My favorite restaurant we visited during a trip to Montreal. The food and service was amazing. My friends and I all ordered different dishes and there wasn't one that disappointed. There's a nice selection of beer available and the atmosphere was very inviting, a warm and welcoming feel. The price was very appropriate considering the quality of food.",2
"A bit pricey for Mexican food. I did enjoy their salsa and bean dip. I had ordered a burrito with rice and beans, with a soda. My tab came up to about 21. Again a bit pricey, but I did enjoy the meal I had with my 2 other girlfriends. Would I come back here, sure why not, if I'm going for an occasion. But if I wanted to get my Mexican food fix.I'd rather go to Filiberto's or some other place.",1
"Got a great deal on my tires. They didn't try to upsell and helped me decide the best tires for my needs. Even when the budget didn't matter, they didn't simply pick the easiest to find or most expensive tire. The staff was top notch and very willing to help, answer questions, and worked quickly getting my truck back as soon as possible.",2
"The sushi here tasted like grocery store sushi, which really bummed me out because we drove pretty far to eat here. The service was excellent and everyone was very friendly. I had a roll called gone with the wind which was supposed to have avacado, but there was no avacado, it was substituted with asparagus, which I did not care for. All the rolls I ate were dried out tasting",1
"The food here is ok. The Wagyu sliders were really good. Wouldn't recommend the grilled cheese though. The service is pretty bad, had a hard time getting a hold of the waitress. The decor is like McDonald's, and the tables are stained and dirty. The frozen hot chocolate was ok. Nothing was worth the money except the sliders. Save your money and try another place.",1
I like coming to Arcadia Ice Den for two reasons. The first one is that I love ice skating and second my husband plays hockey here. Patently this ice rank is the best one in town. It may not be in the best around of town. But the ice rank is really nice. So if you want to go ice skating somewhere and are in the arcadia area you should come here to ice skate.,2
Worse place to get a rental. No information about 150.00 deposit. No information about HAVING to get insurance when other places allow you to decline. It was our first time renting here and definitely our last! I wish i checked the reviews before coming here. Plus their office smells so bad of heavy perfume cologne. Ugh,1
"Deutlich besser als sein Ruf! nDas Luxor hat keinen besonders guten Ruf, nach den aufwendigen Renovierungsarbeiten sollte sich dies aber u00e4ndern. Tolle Auswahl an Shows, gro u00dfe Poollandschaftzund gutes Preisniveau. Lage ist auch ok, wenn auch nicht perfekt da man eher am Ende des Strips ist. Freundliches Personal und weniger als 10min vom Flughafen entfernt.",2
I have come to this location four separate times to set up an account. After being sent away for not having made an appointment the second time I should have learned my lesson but I was told most days I wouldn't need one. It's next door to my work but the convenience just isn't worth the attitude of the tellers.,1
"I've been trying to find a better burger than this.I can't find one! If you got one, feel free to msg it to me. And yes, I've tried Bachi Holstein etc. Reason why I am updating.NUTELLA SHAKES! Best thing ever.seriously.get one. Its very smooth and refined.like they make it out of whipped cream instead of grinded up ice. If I could give this place 10 stars I would.so two 5 star reviews should do!",2
"Stopped here recently because I wanted to support Willy Street amid all the construction. The girl behind the counter treated us like we weren't cool enough to be there. I felt like an outsider instead of welcomed, very discouraging when I was trying to patronize a local business in the middle of a tough time for the street as a whole. I definitely will not be going back.",1
"Great central Mexico food. I had the shrimps tacos which are flat out flavor. I have had many dishes here and all are good. Keep in mind, this is not a typical Mexican joint. It is higher in price and unique flavors. Drawback is the chips and salsa, good, just not what I crave. Plus is a very cool vibe and amazing flavors. Also, great margs.",2
"Rack of lamb delicious. This place lamb burger couldn't tell it apart from a regular burger, but it was still awesome. The waffle fries were some the best I've ever had. It's a bit more toned down compared to other Vegas restaurants but still some good food at a good price TVs all around for your watching entertaiment",2
"Just got a call from this outfit claiming their name is ""Reliant Capitol "" and it is. Plus many other names. Not sure about their work but don't care for their marketing techniques. We are also on the Do Not Call list and they showed up as unlisted. Folks if you want to earn my business, please be more honest.",1
"BEST PLACE! I took my husband here for his birthday and boy was he so happy! Our food was amazing. We got a chicken empanada, meat platter grill for 2, and my son chicken fingers and dolche dessert! We had left overs too The meat was soo good, the platter came with 2 filet mignon, chicken breasts, sausage, two stack of short ribs, and wow delicious! GO, YOU WILL BE SO HAPPY!",2
"The food is delicious, and the atmosphere is great. It was comfortable and quiet. The flavor like no other and the coffee an A . My first time there I was a bit confused with the dynamics of how to order to go, so I decided to stay and have breakfast there. nGreat experience. Totally worth the calories. I recommend this place.",2
"We love Frankie's! This bar has such a cool vibe. The ""regulars "" aren't territorial, the drinks are so good, and I love the passion for tiki decor! We had a bartender there on a weeknight maybe a Monday? , he had a Hawaiiaame that escapes me now, but he was the coolest guy and we enjoyed our time chatting with him! Keep it up Frankie's, you guys are badass.",2
"Hate that my friends love this bar. Pitchers are expensive. They typically play loud dance music, but do not have a dance floor. I think they do that just to try and pull people in walking St. Laurent. If they played rock music it would definitely fit the establishment better. They have lots of pool tables, but you have to put up with their obnoxious music. Many better bars in town. Skip it.",1
It was our first time to Cornish Pasty Co. and it did not dissapoint. One thing to keep in mind is it takes 15 20 min for them to cook one of their fresh pastys so if you are hungry make sure to order a side salad to start to help hold you over. Their lime pesto house salad dressing was amazing! The food was great and the huge outdoor seating will keep us coming back!,2
"This club is horrible. I came with my cousins because we had to kill some time and we didn't want to gamble. We paid 20 to get it it was around 1am . As soon as we got in, I wanted to get out. It was kind of dead. The only people there were older women. The music sucked. Only positive thing there was when I took a shot. 2 seconds of fun.",1
"Don't try to step out of the venue for any reason . You'll be interrogated by the gendarme at full length. The buzz among the food biz is this contrived confused entity is hemorrhaging money and servers are leaving left and right. If you want to waste your money to say you experienced RRL , Hurry! It won't be there long",1
I know nothing about A C's. Searched Yelp for a good company to give my business to and I couldn't be happier with Arizona's Dukes of Air. Robert came to my house within an hour of calling and had the problem fixed in about 45 mins. Not only did he get my unit up and running but he went out of his way to show me some preventative maintenance tips. I would highly recommend giving these guys a shot.,2
I'm writing this months after I went so keep that in mind. But I really liked this place. Just a nice small breakfast place where I had Eggs and Toast. It was yummy and right down the street from part of the University of Edinburgh's campus. If I'm ever back in Edinburgh which I hope to be and near this area of the city I'd definitely go again. it was a affordable and comfortable.,2
"Oh my goodness how this place is considered a ""dance "" club on beyond me. Certainly wouldn't be considered one where I'm from. Wall to wall people, 20 cover charge, gangster rap and the whole place reeked of weed. The only redeeming factor was the cheap beer. But I'd rather not get shot in a nightclub, so I got the heck outta there.",1
"Oh this chicken was so finger licking good. It didn't taste like it was processed with chemicals like KFC does. This place was hella buzy on a Saturday afternoon. My only complaint is that I got a chicken burger which is actually just a chicken leg with bones put in 2 buns, so I had to pull out the meat.",2
My fianc u00e9 adores the Irish Breakfast and gets it every single time. I get the Chicken Wrap and it's always good as are the french fries or chips? . The service is usually great and they have our favorite Irish beer Smithwicks . Great atmosphere with cool booths if you're lucky enough to get them. Have been going here for years and will usually stop by when in town.,2
"We stopped in this past Sunday for a late lunch after a day of shopping. Service was bar none! Kevin was very attentive, thank you! The sushi was amazing fresh, highly recommend the crazy roll if you like it spicy. Also had the pork katsu bento box. Very tasty, and the Gyoza reminded me of my childhood in Taiwan. Totally recommend this place if you're in Goodyear!",2
"Everytime I go here to get my oil changed its just a rough experience. Stood at the front desk waiting for assistance for about five minutes while the employees were arguing in front of me, with no acknowledgment. It took four and a half hours to get my oil changed. And got my car back with a key chain broken off the keys. Unacceptable.",1
I have been eating at the Grand Cafe inside of Red Rock for years now. My absolute favorites would have to be the Tuscan Chicken salad and the Eggs Benedict. The service is typically very good and even more so if you are a regular. Pricing is similar to that of any other casino hotel cafe. I foresee many more visits to this spot due to its convenient location from my work and delicious food.,2
"Took the parents out to dinner and this was opened on the Monday that we were there at CA Hotel. Ordered the Rib eye medium rare and baked potato. Everything was delicious, but dessert.I know! I ordered the Creme Brulee. The custard was too thick, it wasn't creamy and the caramelized sugar on top was greasy. No bueno.",2
"This place I more hype and fluff than substance. The customers think that being there makes them cool which masks the mediocre ingredients, copy cat recipes, and tough crust. The pizza isn't bad it's just not great, but when you have to deal with this caliber of stuck up clientele, I'd say go elsewhere.",1
"Nothing special here. Some lights, a DJ, a small dance area, mediocre drinks, decently priced for a place in the Mandalay Bay, and lots of sitting room. Convenient for those staying at the Mandalay Bay or The Hotel and not too crowded no cover, open seats available but almost too loud for talking with friends.",1
"Kind of a weird crowd last Friday night but the DJ was AMAZING. Really good mix of brand new and older songs. The place is pretty cool and there's a ton of room to dance. There's a few open table areas where you can hang out or rest your feet without having to buy a bottle. There were a ton of guys, we were definitely outnumbered, at least 4 1.",2
"I had the cheeseburger with blue cheese, and Yum! Burger is juicy, and no skimping on cheese. We also had the pickle chips, which were okay.the pickle to batter ratio wasn't as good as I like, a thicker pickle chip would solve that. My husband had a chocolate banana shake. It was served with a extra large straw, and tasted great. I like the open air seating. All In all, glad we stopped in.",2
"Sucked! Dry comedy, not very funny. I had high hopes, super excited to go and extremely disappointed. No one got wet, percussion was cool but only lasted about 15 minutes of entire show. Lots of down time. The best part was the last 10 minutes when the white large bouncing balls dropped from the ceiling. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.",1
"I love Switch! The one thing I don't get is how Switch can be soooo good, but Fez Ticoz are so not good when they are owned by the same people? I don't understand how they get it so right at Switch, but yet so wrong at the other two places. Switch has a great vibe and great food. It's become my favorite place in PHX!",2
"The food here is not bad and price is reasonable for Vegas standard. Especially if you're not a buffet person, and don't have the budget for fancy restaurants, this is the place to go. The modern interior design and view is pretty nice also, but try to avoid coming here during afternoon. The reflection of the sunlight from the hotel glass can be very annoying.",2
"This place was down the street and decided to give it a try.my husband and I were very disappointed,15 minutes after we walked in finally after being ignored for a while we finally got someone in to give us a roll then we had to wait another 15 minutes just to get a second roll and still were being ignored the server was pretty nice they were not too busy but seem to act like they were.",1
"Truly as good as it gets when you think about a gastro pub. I am a jaded New Yorker, and this place put me at ease! The micro brewed beers were amazing, but the food was the real star! We ordered the cheese and charcuterrie plates, and loved every minute of it! Sit on the terrace on the 2nd floor if you can! LOVE this place!",2
"I wanted to give it three stars because the lobby was so great, the bar and bar staff were awesome and the beds were comfortable enough. But for the rate that we paid the cleanliness of our hotel room was unacceptable. There was a massive stain in the middle of the floor and left over beverages from the last occupants, and a stain on the comforter. Big disappointment.try the Hilton.",1
If pancakes are your name they better be good. These are great. All kinds of options and great quality. Recommend ordering the real maple syrup to get the full experience. The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is because of the silverware. It's a pet peeve but eating great food of sharp edged tin forks just takes away from the efforts of the chef to provide a great experience.,2
New to Vegas and was exploring Container Park when we were told by a local about eat. We're beyond happy she did! Great feel and environment in the restaurant. Best Iced Tea I've ever had and we both loved our lunches. I got the Reuben and my wife got the grilled cheese with the tomato soup. If you're in the area.GO!,2
This was the first groomer we tried out in the Phoenix area. They had good reviews on yelp and good prices so we gave them a try. I was not impressed and left really missing our groomer back in CA. I asked for my dog's tail to get special attention. She was given back to me with matts still in her tail and her face hadn't been cleaned thoroughly. Pretty disappointed will not be returning.,1
Amazing pizza with a lot of toppings to choose from. Their buffalo chicken wings are big and crispy. Chicken fingers are saucy and so good especially chicken finger sub! white pizza is the BEST in town and beef on weck is very tasty and juicy on traditional Kennewick bun. You have to check this place out I'm telling you the best food in town!,2
"Really stupid. nGuys were dressed pretty much the whole time. nDrinks were 15 each. ALL THEY SHOW ARE BUTTS! Who cares. I mean, the butts were nice but not worth the money and we had 1 2 off tickets! Sorry but it is nothing like I expected and just really stupid. At least put on a speedo or something!",1
"Got repetitive, real quick. Too many things going on. I feel that every motion should be meaningful. This was not the case, it felt that half the times performers were waiting for their queue. One great thing about this is the stage. Anywhere you sit is a good seat. nVerdict Go watch the O show instead.",1
"LOVE this lunch buffet. Never been for dinner that's why I gave it only 4 stars and not 5 . The buffet is always excellent. Lots of variety with hot dishes, tons of flavor. Always some beloved common dishes and some surprises if you're looking to try new things. I've seen goat curry. The waitstaff is helpful and nice, and hands down for me it's the best Indian buffet in the city.",2
"Love their happy hour. They have a diverse selection on their happy hour menu, and many items without rice as I tend to avoid it. I have never had anything bad there. Their spicy tuna salad is my favorite. My only complaint the snotty Summerlin crowd that tends to frequent that place, and the old men who save seats at the bar with no guests to ever appear.",2
"Very cool spot to spend with the family. 12 miles off the strip, it is new, gorgeous and full of stuff to do for the whole family. Life is different in Vegas with two kids and you have to change your focus a bit. Bowling, movies, arcades and restaurants. All good stuff. Great hotel, but the restaurants are hit and miss with both quality and staffing. We will definitely be back here.",2
"This place is a joke. The only reason they are still in business is because there are no other quick food options in the Hughes Center. Less than friendly service and very average quality overpriced food 8 greek salad with a few thin strips of meat, 3 tomato wedges, and a huge bed of iceberg lettuce . Not recommended.",1
"Don't get the fries they're AWFUL. I'm not the only one that's way overdue for an oil change. The cheesesteaks aren't awful, they're just bad, pretty standard airport fast food. The space was filthy with trash on the floors and all the surfaces were dirty and sticky. They were one of the only places open in the B terminal at 7 45 on a Saturday night, so it's where we went.",1
We went to meet some friends and had drinks while our friends finished dinner. The server was OUTSTANDING! She knew her job and did it with amazing accuracy! I have not had this kind of service since leaving Okinawa. The place was packed but we were acknowledged immediatly and there was no issue when we joined our friends. CANNOT wait to go back for a full meal!,2
"We hit Six Penn before a show for dinner, and afterwards for dessert. The food was quite good both times. We let our dinner server know that we had a show to attend, and she timed the courses perfectly. She was very familiar with the menu, and very attentive. Overall, we were very impressed by this place, and plan on going back sometime.",2
First time to try Wildfish. Very happy we did. Everything was excellent from the crab cake appetizer through the great entrees and finally the perfectly created sophisticated individually baked blackberry pie. Price is very reasonable give the outstanding quality. Went early 6pm to beat the crowd. Worked well. Reservations recommended,2
"A okay mall. Kinda deserted. Lots of small shops. Not too many big names. Or I didn't get that far in. You should, however, stop by the ""Buy today, gone tomorrow' store. you might find a steal. I bought those cake pans that are shaped like a donut, oreo cookie or cupcake for only 7. I went to the as soon on tv store and they sold for about 25. A steal? Hell yeah. Same brand and all too.",1
"My husband and I have been to this restaurant quite a few times and every time we leave, we're glad we went. They always have good, friendly service and good food. I like the fact that they have a nice wine selection with unique choices you don't see at other places. I hope it's around for a while and continues to remain high in quality and service.",2
I was very surprised by this place. It was totally kicked back. Nice decor and atmosphere. Both bartenders were very alert and super friendly. They have this hourly bingo drawing for free play. Surprisingly it paid out quite well for my wife and I. The food was definitely way above my expectations as well.,2
"I finally was able to try this place, and it is so fun! I went twice, once I sat inside, and theext time sat outside which was wonderful as well, and it is a perfect spot for people watching. Their drinks are tasty and have a great selection for trying something new. The bartenders and servers were warm and talkative which is a plus. I'll be back!",2
"My daughter recommended this place. Her nails look beautiful and last for awhile. Went in today for gel manicure and LOVE them. Service here was super friendly, even other customers. My little one got a her nails polished and staff was very sweet to her. Been a long time since I've had a great experience at a nail salon.will be back and recommend this place to friends.",2
I do not understand all of the good reviews for this place. The ginger chicken bowl was dry and bland except for the ginger sauce which tasted like it came from a can. It had a distinct Metallic taste. The miso soup was so salty you could barely taste any miso flavor at all. The only semi decent thing was the hot sauce. And the rice was edible. I will not be coming back.,1
"I came across this place like many of the others here, on Groupon. I decided to check it out since it's close by and seemed like a cool place. Amy cut and styled my hair and did a fantastic job! I was given a cold drink, an awesome scalp massage and friendly conversation while getting my cut. I loved this place and will return!",2
"The place was ok. Wasn't too sure about the burgers since it seemed like it was really thin and over fried. The taste is unique so I guess it is a good thing if you are into that. I prefer thicker patties. A little pricey. not as good as In N Out in my opinion. And for the price, also not as good as Steak N Shake which comes with fries with your order for the same price.",1
Beware! The restaurant is actually around the corner from the walk up counter. We didn't know that and since there were made to order creeps at the counter we just assumed we were in the right place. We weren't. After having a good breaky here we found the REAL restaurant around the corner Would have much rather eaten there as their excellent menu is much larger in the sit down restaurant.,2
"After just a couple visits, I must say ""This IS just about as good as it gets ""! Driven by many times. Finally stopped for goodies to take home to a sick wife. The place is SPOTLESS. the customer service and overall attitude is amazing and the breakfast sandwiches, coffee drinks and fresh baked in house goodies are GREAT! I love locally owned successes! nKeep it up!",2
"Very popular spot with average of 30 mins waiting time at the peak hours for dinner. Papaya salad was alright, nothing great. However the Panang Curry was awesome. You should definitely try the Tom yum soup lots of mushroom and very feeding. Spice level just go mild, which I think was a 2 on a 1 5 scale. I still found 2 to be a little hot. Overall def recommended if you're down there.",2
"Neat little hideaway in front of a manmade lake. nI love how the restaurant is separated from the bar, but you can see into the bar. nWeekly specials. happy hour. They even had specials for thanksgiving and valentines day,probably more, but i happened to go in during those times. nMy breakfast burrito was huge two meals. nreally friendly service.",2
"Who knew what a pasty was, or that they are amazing! They are like large hand pies filled with complete meals. This is such a wonderful place. They have a wide variety and even many vegetarian options. You can't help but feel good when you are there. As good as the food is, the experience is equal. It is a very relaxed environment, and by the way, a great list of beers.",2
"My whole family loves this place. It is cozy, the food is great, and the people that work there are very friendly. I've tried a variety of the dishes and haven't had a bad one. I particularly like the masaman curry, Thai samosas, and anything with their peanut sauce. Even if Banana Leaf were not a mere block away I would frequent the place!",2
Good wings and excellent take out service. If you like crispy wings be sure to order them well done. I prefer them meaty and moist so they tend to cook them perfect for me. Strawberry Hot and Thai are my favorite flavors. The potatoe skins are boats like you dream of. Be sure to add that to your order.,2
"This a review for the vegetarian bunch. This place was fabulous. We both had the vegetarian entree which was a combo place of many of their sides. Not only was the food good but the waitstaff was excellent and helpful. It was shame to see them not busy on a Friday night, but can only claim a low profile location for the reason. Go here before it becomes crowded!",2
"I had a problem with my postal box someone must've mistakenly tried to open it and broke their key leaving part of it in the lock. I called Johnny on Saturday morning, met him at the box 5 minutes later, and he replaced it. Excellent, cordial, and reasonable service. I will use JT for all key and lock issues. Highly recommended.",2
"I absolutely LOVE Sprinkles. The only two cupcake places I would go are Mind over Batter and Sprinkles. The first time I tried Sprinkles was a Red Velvet cake, Uhhhh YUM! However you caever really dine in and eat you cupcake since the store is so small, so i'm always in a hurry to go in choose my cupcake and GO! it's great, the staff are amazing! I love it!",2
"I have really enjoyed all of experiences at SMG. It is not ""luxury "" but you get what you pay for. It is extremely affordable, the service is always great, and the food is good. The seats are not too bad, just comfortable enough. I would recommend you go and try out SMG for yourself, I don't think you would be disappointed.",2
I remember being blown away by the Al's Beef I had in Chicago. This not so much. Service was quick and friendly and I thought there was a fair amount of meat on the sandwich but there was nothing special about it. I ordered it with everything and they skimped on the cheese. I don't see myself going back any time soon.,1
"I have gotta say, this yogurt place is probably the most tasteless I've experienced. As the froyo trend has spread across the valley, I know that I have tried just about everything. The yogurt is typically the same tasting, but this place just didn't do it for me. The best part about the experience was the service, though!",1
"Went back again on Sunday early evening and had a whole sausage pie as recommended the first time we went. It was VERRY good. Definitely a whole pie is better than a single slice. It had been a long day, so we picked a spot in front of the TV and waited for the pizza. Very pleased. Wish it was closer to home, or on the way home from work but still not so far out of the way. Excited to go back.",2
"Outstanding meal every time. Start off with the Tuna cubed. It's Tuna 3 different ways and every bit is a new flavor. If you are unsure about what to order, always go with the meatloaf, but anything you pick shouldn't disappoint. They have fresh ingredients that make me question what other restaurants are doing wrong. So much better than Salt of the Earth. Don't forget BYOB!",2
"The food is horrible. I had a wheat breakfast burrito and could only eat a couple of bites. Had to stop because it felt like powder eggs, old cheese and stale tortilla. The only thing good was quick serviceand a salsa bar. Don't fall for the clean look and display, a greasy diner would at least taste better. Einstein bros bagel right next to it, trust name brands while traveling.",1
My favorite part of the trip! It was a long walk from the Mirage hotel but my boyfriend and I took the monorail back so it wasn't too bad. Although it made me insane once we were in the free exhibit all the people taking photos of the lions who would come close to glass and their bright camera flashes would go off. Be courteous to the animals people! Other than that fun times!,2
"Food here is very good and is different in a cool chic way compared to other Thai restaurants. Atmosphere is what I would expect in NYC, LA and SF, which is refreshing especially for locals who would rather avoid the Strip. I wish there was a branch in the Westside, which would allow me to visit much more often. If you like Thai food, you have to try Le Thai.",2
Every time I go to this place I ask myself what I am doing there. I rarely find anything there that is a good buy and the staff is completely ridiculous. They usually talk down to me and they aren't very helpful at all. Even more so when I try to sell very good items to them I get very little back. Not worth it.,1
"Went on a groupon plus two others.very expensive.food plentiful but average, service average.never refilled water. Made us get three checks because of groupon.automatic 20 percent tip.very loud.not many customers on a friday night. This is the second time i have been there with a groupon. First time was fun, friendly, full, lively.this time crappy. Wont go back.",1
"Its November 2nd.yesterday I enjoyed the Thanksgiving blend without the tryptophan after nap and didn't have to wear my stretchy pants either. Today I went for it. Full on Red Cup Skinny Peppermint Mocha, that escalated quickly into the holidays. Oh yeah, it's AZ, I've got my flip flops on and I'm on the patio. At least my pedi color matches my cup. Otherwise it would be so awkward.",2
"Nope. This place has always had the absolute worst service ever. One semester I went to get treated for this 'chest cold' that turned out to be pre pneumonia after I got it checked out by a real doctor. Same thing happened to my suitmate's gf. She had it worse. My advice is, if you think it is worse than whatever it is they say it is, go get a second opinion.",1
"Don't get me wrong I love this place but today was enough to make me say no more chances, first order of hot wings were under cooked called back got them replaced and even waited 20min for them to be fresh took them home and guess what, still under cooked, I'm thinking their fry oil isn't hot enough to cook these hot wings throughly.",1
"This Starbucks sucks. In terms of cleanliness and quality. It's fine. Standard. But the PRICE. It costs almost as much as eating at a normal breakfast place. Also I just really needed a cup of water and got told it's .75 for water. Awesome Starbucks. I will go down the way and eat at an actual restaurant if I am going to pay 35 for 2 breakfast sandwiches, 2 drinks and some water.",1
"This is a place where you can come to and don't have to worry about all the Vegas glitz and glamour. If you are looking for that, there is plenty of it on the strip. Here you can just be yourself and have fun. Drinks are cheap, parking lot is huge and free. Easy to get in and out of and alot of space. I don't notice any abnormal smells, so I guess since 2009 they cleaned the place up.",2
I like Gennaros. Standard pizza hole in the wall kind of place. They're never busy and the staff is always grumpy but the pizza taste good so I keep going back. Prices are middle of the road and the same as pizza Sola and sals. If your looking for a local pizza place that serves decent food go here.,2
"Being that this is the only fast food that is easily accessible between Uptown and Sardis Road, I have to stop here frequently to get my daughter something to eat before dance practice. We always go through the drive through. Service is always excellent and the wait time is minimal. I can't complain when her stomach is growling which it does frequently as Arby's fits the bill.",2
"1. Sophisticated palate n2. Bottomless pit for a stomach n3. Penchant for sweet potato fries n4. Specialty burger connoisseur n5. Cocktail consumer n6. Trendsetter If you can identify with one or more of the qualities above, this is the place for you. Their food is inventive, flavorful, and PLENTIFUL! It's the perfect place for date night happy hour brunch with the girlfriends.",2
"Thought we would try the place for lunch and sadly very disappointed. The food was poor. We got two ""beer "" bread flatbreads and it was more like stale flour bread. We were the only group in the entire restaurant for the entire time we were there. They need to step up their quality or they will sadly be out.",1
Made reservation because had other engagements. Showed up and waited twenty minutes. They said sorry people who have your table haven't left yet. As if they only have one table. When we informed them of our time constraints. They made no offer to help out. Like the food but not so good at keeping the reservation. And really that's the most important part,1
"One of my favorite neighborhood bars in the south west. John Jackie the bartenders are always amazing. affordable drink prices and really good food you cant go wrong with this place. food wise try the Chicken Avocado sandwich. chicken, avocado, house dressing in a Parmesan sourdough bread its sooo yummy!",2
"Here is a tip If you want more of something they don't bring around often namely, my favorites, the beef rib and the filet mignon tell your server that you want it and they'll bring it out based on your request. I went again last night and have decided that my favs are the beef rib then the filet. Now that I know these are the 2 best things I sparingly get slices of other meats.",2
"I really enjoy this place. Love that they carry Colette patterns and the staff is always very helpful. They have big sofas and a fairly large selection of fabrics, including one of my favorite lines Liberty of London! . I often stop by here on my way to visit a friend who lives up that way guess I will be seeing her more often ",2
"Never will go back. We ordered our food and my boyfriend got his burger first. By the time he was done eating I finally got mine. We ordered milkshakes and didn't get those until we were finished with our meals. All of our food was cold. The smash fries are gross. Seriously, mcdonalds would have been a lot better.",1
"Got the pulled pork and beans. Neither the beans nor the pork had any sweetness, which is fine, but they didn't really have any other flavors either they were very salty though . The pork seemed like it was probably made days ago and it was room temperature. After already being disgusted by what I just ate I found a hair in the beans. Long story short it was terrible.",1
"I love love love love this place! It's a few blocks from work I go here daily. I usually get the breakfast wrap with the green goodness smoothie with no agave! I have a routine down, Presto for Breakfast Greens Proteins for Lunch! You should really check this place out, Reza his cousin are great guys and are always so nice and polite. Friendly faces are good to see!",2
"I personally did not enjoy their pizza. Not only is their regular sauce zesty, but the pizza as a whole was not good. Reheated was even worse and in fact not edible. I ordered in the restaurant, but took the pizza home. When I complained online they did not offer to reimburse me and they called me a liar. Terrible customer service from corporate.",1
"This is the Post Office closest to my home. It is convenient to just drop something off at but it is WAY too busy to try and send something from package wise.I wouldn't want to stand in this line! Seems everyone working here and going here is rude as well. Hmmmmm. Well, it works for quickly dropping stuff at.",1
"GO HERE! I'm in town for a wedding and I wanted to get a body wrap. Everywhere I called downtown said they did not have an esthetician to do a wrap. Found this place. What a find. It is in an older building and has been beautifully refurbished. The spa is tasteful, serene and cozy. The owner, Jennifer, is a delightful young woman and the experience was flawless. I cannot say enough. Go here!",2
"I rarely go out uptown but if I do, this is often the place. It's a nice pub that is usually packed but pretty casual for being uptown. They do a great job of catering to groups and parties. I have attended several events that included free appitizers and drink specials. they reserve several tables for your group upstairs.",2
I love church's chicken but this location is ridiculous. The employee are super slow and rude. I'm assuming it was the manager had his pants sagged so much you can see his sweaty marks in his undwrwear. I'll definitely be contacting Corp because if that's the manager there's a huge problem. It's weird they are so slow because all the food is already made.,1
"This hotel is in a good location on the Las Vegas strip. I stay here maybe every other month. It is overpriced in my opinion but that is what you get for staying in Las Vegas. The bathrooms are great with a tube an shower, seep rate toilet room, an his her sinks. My favorite part of this hotel is having a view of the water show. I never get tired of it!",2
"Recently visited Frank and Lupes. Food was very good but service was slow. In fact, we had to go to the bar to order drinks because our waiter wasn't coming over to our table. At the end of dinner, my dinner partner left the table to use the restroom, and our waiter came over and asked me if I was waiting to be seated.this after he had been already waiting on me for an hour and a half.",1
i have been a loyal customer for at least 5 years. i have never ordered a plate i didnt like. would be a 5 star if the service was a little better. except for mae the waitress.shes the best. i really like that they will customize your food to how spicy you want. the most ive been able to handle is the 10 x spicy beef lo mein!,2
This was my second time and most likely my last.first time with my relator. and second with my associate. well. both times the overpriced menu didnt do much for me.nor the small portions. thanks but no thanks. This wonna be Fancy Veitnamese just not cutting it. nFancy French.like Vogue.well yes for sure.! Wonder how well it will do by next year? Hopefully better.,1
"PINK TACO is amazingly, stupendously, brilliantly. AVERAGE! Nothing remarkable about this place except the name. Average food, average service, average crowd. I wonder if their marketing department ever expected that they could over hype something so much that it would just let people down. I am yawning as I am writing this.",1
"Came in for the first time in a long time. Kind of disappionted, condiments fell out of both halves of the footlong my son and i split and the gal behind the conter started giggling when she was corrected on the sandwhich after putting chicken on it. I think it will be a while before i return to this location again.",1
"I came to Tivioli for the farmers market, it is amazing! Walking through the shops and restaurants on a warm Saturday morning with a cup of Joe, how can you not be relaxed! This shopping center makes you feel like you are out of towot in Vegas. They have quite a bit of different shops from clothing to oils. Also has a great valet service with an option for a car wash!",2
Paid around 340 for 2 nights sat sun and surprisingly it was a great stay! The room was very clean I think they recently re did it? . Great location on the strip as well. Highlight The guest services lady was very accommodating and helped us find a way back to Los Angeles when we were stranded there without a ride back! Tip try the Frog's punch at Senor Frogs!,2
"Very good food and service at reasonable prices for a Vegas hotel restaurant. House wine was very drinkable. Food quality was excellent. Very good, properly prepared pasta. Wonderful service. The reason for only 4 stars is that the restaurant is hard to find in the labyrinth of the Venetian hotel, which was frustrating. Parking is free in the hotel lot.",2
"I've gone here about once or twice a year for about 7 years. The girls are great, but I was just there last weekend and while I was fine with 100 for a private dance, I was shocked by the 46 price tag for two drinks. I might show up again in the future if I'm dragged there, but I'm definitely never getting a private ever again.",1
"If rock hard burned yet miraculously Undercooked potatoes, end cuts of a roast and ice cold veg is your thing then by all means waste your money and time sitting waiting 15 mins for your drink, and standing in queues for 20 mins when there's no servers at the hotplate. Honestly it'd take less effort and money to cook your own meal and you have more chance of it being hot too.",1
I was first shocked by how busy this place was. It was 11am on a Monday and it was rocking which I guess is a good thing. The portions were large as others had mentioned and the Arizona omelet I had was awesome. Pancakes were a little buttery for my liking and I passed on the hash browns because they looked greasy but thats just being critical.,2
"My bf had the ribs they was absolutely dreadful, really hard and wasn't even edible. I had the pulled pork it was so so. The bar was nicely stocked.I'm definitely not a fan of the place at all, if you like fold up chairs and lunch room like places I guess it could be nice? I'm from the real country east coast and this place was just way to uncomfortable for me to want to be at.",1
"these guys are real and fun to just hang out with and talk. Charlie gave me a haircut and we were just talking and watching tv. The normal things you would expect to do at a barber shop. It's a little warm in there but bearable. Definitely will be back, had a great time there. Usually when i go into barber shops i just sit and get a haircut but these guys were engaging and funny. Good stuff",2
"I understand the haters' objections overpriced, inconsistent service , but I've always gotten a kick out of this place. Great food, and going during the lunchtime rush is kind of fun rather than an ordeal it's got a nice, almost neighborhood institution feel, and it seems like there are a lot of regulars.",2
WAY OVERPRICED! Went to dinner last night here and was shocked at the prices! 9 for 8 cheese sticks! Our daughter ordered a slushy and we were shocked to find out they were 4 A PIECE and they kept asking her if she wanted a refill! We won't be back till they lower their prices. Food wasn't even that great!,1
"I agree completely with the last review. RUDE and extremely unprofessional! I also ordered for an occasion and they assured me over the phone and by email my product would be ontime for my event, and of course it wasn't. I will never buy from them again. To bad this site makes you give a star because they do not deserve even one.",1
"They don't even deserve 1 star. Called to place and order, they barely speak English and you can barely understand what they are saying. Made sure they delivered to my area. An hour later they call and say something about my address being you far and the driver was on his way back and I could cancel or wait another 45 minutes. WORST SERVICE EVER! Wasted over an hour of my time.",1
"I do not see what all the hype is about.2 times and still not impressed, or satisfied. I am all about these types of foods on occasion but the waffle was horrible and cheap, the chicken was dry and tasteless and my lunch was 14.I have tried multiple menu items and have found all of them to be sub par products and over priced. Staff is friendly and the location is good but.",1
Average and expensive. I would almost suggest paying for a cab to get you off the strip and enjoy a more authentic Asian experience. Ambiance was fair. Portion sizes were healthy but the chow fuoodles didn't really tickle my fancy. Lacked the flavor depth I was looking for in a restaurant in this price range.,1
"Lots of veggie meatless options. I really liked the seitan gyro. The veggie lentil burger was very substantial and thick, nothing like a frozen patty. The seitan wings are large squares with a grainy breading coating. Not the best, but not bad either. Good beer selection. One of the largest outdoor patios in the city.",2
I went for a bach party with about 14 others and the service was excellent. I had the Chilean sea bass which was so Delicious. The broth was subtle and so addicting. Also had some jalapeno popper type things also really good. We had a great experience. So much that we are going back for another Bach party. Yes it is over priced like all Vegas upscale restaurants.,2
"Always come here for Spaghetti and Meatballs on Monday and Tuesday. You can't mess up noodles, and the sauce is good and the meatballs are really good. Great place to dine out if you are on a budget or need a break from over paying at other places. Service is good if not a little slow, but that's because the place is usually packed to the ceilings on the days we go.",2
"Probably the worst place you could stay in Vegas. The place is old, dingy and the rooms smell like smoke, the food was nasty and it's very far north. The only semi redeeming quality of the place was the fact that it had a decent poker tourney which you can find at any legit poker room on the strip . The only way I'd ever stay here again was if every other room on the strip was booked.",1
Bathroom cleaning log for Einstein Bagles on Eastern and Warm Springs showed the last day it was cleaned was the 11th.Today is the 18th . so am I to assume the bathrooms haven't been cleaned for a week?! Hope the kitchen gets cleaned more often. Also would be nice if your employees smile every once in a while.,1
"Rude and distrustful. As I walked in, I was ""asked "" to leave my backpack up front. I responded, ""no I would not like to. "" I asked if it was a request or a demand. I was told they requested bags be left up front. I noticed another woman with a purse who was not asked to leave her bag. . . I prefer to shop where I am trusted and respected.",1
"I've never stayed here but I have lost money here. A good deal of money and for that I hate this place. I am only reviewing the roller coaster. It kicks ass. I mean, goddamn, this isnt Knotts Berry Farm or Magic Mountain, its a feakin hotel, but that roller coaster was a welcome experience after losing a couple c notes and drinking watered down cocktails.",1
"Very nice experience. We went there for lunch a couple of weeks ago had the strawberry fields salad, beer chicken wings the grilled cheese brucshetta it was all awesome ! Very attentive wait staff. One thing I have had to send back each time I've been there though is their ice tea it's gross! other than that I reccomend it",2
Erin Kelly owns a chair at Dylan's Salon She is simply amazing she consults with each client and gets a vision of what they want and each time i have my hair done i leave feeling beautiful. I also enjoy being able to sip on wine from Postinos next door while she does my hair. Erin is so personable and you leave with an experience. Stop in and let her use her talents on your hair.,2
"Used to be one of our fav spots. Appears to have been recently bought by a new company. Menu has been changed, and some of our old favs are gone. Food was alright, but not what it used to be. Portions have been reduced significantly. Service was good, but the atmosphere has become like any other chain steakhouse.",1
"If you're looking for something a bit more upscale than Za's on campus and Biaggi's is out of your price range, Manzella's is the place to go. The portions are big but are slightly pricey. They have a small menu but their speciality is a ""make your own "" past dish. They also have a handful of baked pastas which I found to be good as well.",2
Sets the bar for bad service. Drinks forgotten and then wrong ones hastily delivered. Barista busy swatting flies and doesn't wash hands before going back to the espresso machine. More lost points for playing generic euro synth dance music. A bummer because try stock really good coffees and seem very popular.,1
I have only been here once and they gave me an excellent pedicure but my waxing was horrible! I got my eyebrows waxed and not only did the lady wax one of my eyebrows twice she insulted me and told me I had bad skin and was breaking out. Not exactly the confidence booster I was expecting to get from a spa. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone,1
"Disgusting kitchen infested with roaches! Don't eat here! Dirty disgusting food! I will never eat here again. There was a bug in my soup and the woman owner yelled at me and claimed I put it there in order to get a refund. Wow, I must enjoy keeping bugs in my purse just to get free food. Needless to say, she didn't offer to remake food or refund. I paid and walked out.",1
"Only 6 people in the entire resteraunt on a Friday evening, yet still could not get our food right. nOrdered french fries for our child and they were still raw in the middle. Wife ordered the 25 steak and shrimp which came out 10 minutes before my meal bulgolgi , yet her steak was cold. Will not be going here again.",1
Slick club with the most awesome views of the Vegas strip. Moon is quite spacious and the outdoor patio s are great for fresh air and breathtaking views. The lines to get into this club are every long they start on the ground floor of Palms . I had a VIP pass and was in the club within 5 minutes. I would not come here if I had to wait in line.,2
"Probably the best ph u00f6 spot in Montreal, but don't tell anyone. Okay, maybe tell one or two people, and then start a super secret ph u00f6 gang with them. And then, as your gang grows stronger, invite a few more people to join. Eventually, your gang will be so powerful and this restaurant will be so popular that they'll need to open a second location. but don't tell anyone about that one.",2
"With all the negative reviews, I hesitated to stop here, especially at 8pm on a Saturday night. However, pharmacy services had us in and out in under 30 minutes, especially when we explained how my husband could barely walk and really needed the medicine he was just prescribed at the Urgent Care clinic. All around, a fantastic experience and we appreciated the great service. Will go back again!",2
Oh my goodness! What happened to this place! It was so good when I was younger and I was looking forward to eating here again when I last visited in December 2008. The soup is bland and not very good and the service was horrible. The waiters are rude and they don't bring out the right items. There's always a line so they want you out as soon as possible. Apparently they don't need my business.,1
"Great prices and great burgers! All employees are friendly and always smiling. The general manager is always walking around, giving people their orders and thanking everyone for coming in! She is also open to any feedback you have for the restaurant. nThe food is a great price and it is an open kitchen so you can see them cooking. Get the inferno burger if you like spicy food it is amazing!",2
"I'll keep this one short and sweet. Glad i did it but would never do it again. I am shocked my neck is intact after the abuse this thing put on it. Whiplash city. Cool drops and corkscrews but so not worth the trip to the chiropractor you will have to make afterwards. Also, 14 per person?! I guess I shouldn't be upset, it is Vegas after all.",1
"I'm a fan of Total Wine. In fact, I'm like a kid in a candy shop with all of the craft beers! And the beer prices are much lower than at the grocery store. I was craving pastis, the anise flavored cordial enjoyed by the French in the summer. Sure enough, Total Wine had it! Plus, they have a bike rack extra star added to the list !",2
After read a couple good reviews i visit moderail and i leave not happy.the girl do so quick and i dont have time to relax and enjoy and leave a lot cuticles . So after 15 day i am for one more try . This time i try someone different and still not good job cuticle and paint just part off my nails . Bad bad experience,1
Extremely slow. Didn't even bring out my order until cashier was questioned about why others who had placed their orders after me got their food first. Not even an apology given. The manager of this store seriously needs to do some customer service education for the staff. The Teriyaki Madness on Centennial Center Blvd is much friendlier and faster.,1
I had sampled the other Not Just Coffee earlier in the week so I knew what to expect with this one. It was simply fantastic. While they can't make half calf they can hold off on putting the normal amount of espresso in. They have an awesome coffee bar that you can sit at and enjoy your coffee and look around the market. I just moved here from Seattle and this is the best mocha latte I have had.,2
"Remember the old Wendy's commercial with the old lady asking ""where's the beef? "" nWell, ditto that. nWe split the green chili beef chimi and although it tasted pretty good, there were literally three small pieces of beef with virtually no green chilis. nAs Klohe Kardashian said at her sister's wedding, I give it six f'in months.unless they add some meat to those meals.",1
"Now, this isn't the best pizza I have ever had, but it is the most authentic and that is why it is getting 5 stars. I was craving and in search of a place where I could get the most authentic DOC style Italian pizza, and I honestly think that this place is the best I have ever had at making a certified Margarita pizza. I cannot wait to go back luckily, my grandma lives across the street!",2
"Had dinner there this weekend. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin, which turned out to be pork loin. Dry, tough, chewy. My date had the scallops, which from what I tasted was bland. Seriously, the mashed potatoes were the highlight of dinner. The bill came to on the order of 40, including iced tea. For the money, Denny's is a much better option. Don't think I'll be back.",1
 14 for PHO? well i needed it since I wasnt feeling well but Ive had waaayyy better back home in San Jose aka viettown. Service was slow very limited pho selection. You can tell they made it super americanized modern to appeal to the white folks. Not worth it. BF didnt like his viet sandwhich either how the heck do you mess that up?! ,1
"Great FRESH bread in many varieties. Their pastries aren't as good as the bread is. We have a gluten free person in our house the spelt bread is the best we've found even better than most we've made ourselves. Service is always good. Many people come here for lunch. I haven't done that yet, but it always looks smells great. Very grateful to have them here!",2
"I LOVE In N Out! The food is consistently good and the service is always friendly! I caot say that anything in particular stands out at this location, but it was the one closest to my house and so it was the one that I visited the most. A double double w animal fries is a must! The prices and food are right on target, I miss it so much! ",2
we went here last year on our trip to vegas. we were staying at treasure island and we decided to check out the older vegas and for the price under 10 bucks you cant beat it with a stick. its simple buffet nothing fancy like ti's but it reminds you of what vegas was like in the movies! were going back rhis may and cant wait to come here to eat and shop on fremont street,2
"As soon as I walked in I could smell the pretentious attitude lingering all around. I walked in here for the first time with several of my friends after waiting in line for a short time. The place looks nice. Drinks are pricey. Whatever. It wasn't that big of a deal, but then. BUT THEN. the OWNER walks up to me and says I cannot use my vape indoors. walks out ",1
"Love this place 3 cars they have done for me and i will be going back again for the next car, always friendly. When you have a warranty issue they just replace the tint and it like new again. Its so great to have a company that really understands customer service this day and age. Nano clear front window is the best thing ever. Thanks again Jessica.",2
"Total cool experience 2nd visit with 2 nd car. This team works like a machine , very polite considerate of my time and watch them take the extra min and do it right. Even put up my spare like factory had , didn't expect that. Good guys, great service. Thank you to the Real working guys out there. Keep it up boys! Your appreciated Peace M and family",2
AJ and his crew are extremely professional and efficient. I manage Liberty Market in Downtown Gilbert and we use Streak Patrol for all of our window cleaning as well as pressure washing. Their prices are competitive and the service is stellar. I would highly recommend using Streak Patrol for any residential or commercial property. Keep up the good work AJ!,2
"I've been looking for a self doggie wash on this side of town for a long time and finally found All About Paws. Their self wash area is amazing. Everything you need is provided which is really nice. And the owner is super friendly, even with all of my husky's white fur blowing all over the place! Will definitely return!",2
"I have to agree with the majority of the reviews here. This place does not even warrant a star. I will say the staff was very apologetic, but Dr. D Wachs bedside manner is HORRIBLE! I do not care what type of radio show she has the patients are customers that keeps her in business. As a referral from another doctors office I will let them know that Dr. Wachs is not worth the referral.",1
"I'm not one to write many bad reviews but this pretzel place is awful! We got 4 pretzels cinnamon, jalape u00f1o cheese, almond, and pepperoni. The best one was the cinnamon but the bread on all of them were way too doughy and flavorless, especially the pepperoni and almond. I've had many pretzels and this place will be a pure disappointment!",1
"If I could give less than one star I would. I lived around the corner from this place for 8 years. It's consistently filthy. The staff is typically rude. The food is almost always disgusting I DO like Burger King, but this restaurant is always gross There are a ton of other places to eat in the South Side. skip this place.",1
"Joel is awesome does excellent work at the best rates i've seen from a pro mechanic. If we lived in a small town, he would be the mechanic that everyone knows trusts. He's old school, but on top of everything current. He checks TSB's and shows you the old parts without even asking. I would trust sending my mom to him.",2
"Food is terrible and extremely bland. Blah. We've tried several times just hoping we had caught them on a bad day. Nope. It really is that bad. They have a captive audience and maybe that's why the WWC tries to do as little as possible to resemble a real restaurant. Also, the wine pours are a joke. Their wine could be served in a shot glass.",1
Excellent food! nI often eat here for lunch as it is around the corner from my office. The food is delicious and always fresh. I like that they are local. However be warned they get very very busy during lunch and have limited seating so come here before the lunch rush 11 45 to get a table. Great for salads and sandwiches.,2
"Even with 20 off this was horrible! I could of gotten a better meal at McDonald's! Listen to the reviews please don't waste your money. I'm so disappointed. We came off the plane tired and hungry and didn't want to walk too far.I would of walked to the moon and back if I knew it was this horrible! Food is cold, sitting out, tasteless and no selection. Waste of calories",1
"I travel a lot and I left 14 pieces ,of my best shirts and t shirts , ralph laure, hugo boss, calvin klein and emporio armani , i went to pick up my shirts and the employed told me that just the donated , that simple they donate , more than 1,400 wasted.Do not go to this place , most of the time return my shirts with broken buttons",1
"Mike gave us a fair quote via email to install some ceiling fans. We scheduled an install date and time. Mike was running a bit behind the scheduled appointment time. When he arrived, he very efficiently walked through the job, looked at the fans we had purchased and got to work. The final price ended up being right at what we were quoted. We will definitely use Mike and Good Guys again.",2
"Absolutely one of the best pasta dishes I have eaten. Fresh pasta made right in front of you, tasted like a dish from a top restaurant for under 10 ! Hot, fresher than fresh, great serving size just Go Go Go ! Good job my gym is across the road from pasta fresh cause I got a feeling I will be a regular at this place !",2
Stunned.Stack blows this place out of the water. Me and the lady had the filet and the Kobe skirt. Both were very undesirable and borderline required a complaint to a manager. I really can't believe the dryness of the filet. Literally unbelievable. If you want good filet at the mirage stick to Stack. Their desserts are much better too. Stay away from the chocolate mocha.,1
"I love Middle Eastern food, but this was my first experience with a specifically Syrian restaurant. The yogurt with mint and cucumber was excellent, as was the lamb stew. The couscous had a hint of cinnamon, which I also enjoyed. The salad was basic, lettuce, tomato, added feta, but the vinaigrette they dressed it with was lovely. Good stuff!",2
"I thought Bettie Page only sold online. Boy was I wrong! I came here Sunday morning right after they opened, and Jasmine was extremely awesome and helpful, showing me dresses that would fit my figure. I bought two dresses but I need to get a corset to make my waist a leeetle tinier . I will definitely be visiting the Hollywood store! ",2
This place is over rated. Service is good. Prices are high. Way hyped. I was really expecting to be blown away with from what I heard. Presentation was plain. Good wine selection. But to serve 20 30 dollar dishes and to have to go chopsticks as your dining utensils? Boo! Don't believe the hype. I couldn't believe how many celebrity chefs were pictured there. I don't believe they ate there.,1
Pros nGreat prime rib nUnlimited Mimosas included Cons n Waited 1hr 20 minutes in line to get i Server Joyce was completely inattentive and didn't stop by NOT ONE SINGLE TIME on her own to check in on us offer refills n breakfast items were cold n crab legs tasted fishey no drawn butter was available n stopped serving crab legs about halfway through buffet hours n bathrooms not tidy,1
"We had awesome box seats complete with some tasty snacks and beverages. While I don't claim to know much about Basketball . or anything really , I was able to still have a great time. They had plenty of entertainment including a really awesome competitive teen cheer leading routine, children's choir, and great jazz band. The venue itself is very nice and we even got to see Michael Jordan!",2
"It was our first visit to Spokes and we enjoyed the atmosphere, our server Matt and the food tremendously. nWe almost did not come in because of our disappointment in Spokes Anti Gun policy posted in the front window. nAs good as it was, we will not be back unless Spokes changes it's socialist policy.",1
"This place is fantastic, especially when the weather is nice enough to sit outside on the patio. The beer selection is good and has some of the more flavorful ones I've tasted. I had the Pizza and their wings which were good, if not a little pricey compared to most bars, but tasted great. Will definitely be coming back.",2
Playing Bingo at Harrahs is fun. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. There are pictures of some winners but all the pictures are from 2012 and a couple from early 2013. Surly people have won some jackpots since 2012 2013. They should update the winners pictures. All in all it's a fun place to play bingo.,2
"Overpriced, sloppy work, rude, unfriendly super dirty ESP in the waxing area.scary.Not recommended Try another salon, you will be happy. There is a new place is moving in across the street from this establishment I am thankful as I live close by have to drive far for better service quality of manicure, fills pedicure! Not recommended!",1
"This is our fave family spot dine in and take out! The service, the food and the friggin crust keeps us coming back over all these years. We can't tell you much about the menu bc we always get the Deluxe Chicago style pizza with the ever so amazing Garden Salad add turkey ham with their house dressing that is to die for!",2
"Not a fan. Trying to cut carbs from diet which of course makes eating sushi a challenge. Tried to eliminate some of the excess rice from my rolls today and was told by the manager ""there was a problem and that I was not eating it correctly "" by not eating all of the rice, I would not be served any more. That was a first for me and a last for eating here.",1
"The adlava team is a top notch marketing firm specializing in websites, SEO, and video production. They worked on a project for my client and I was so impressed with their customer service, creativity, and ability to produce amazing results. I highly recommend working with adlava if you need web design or videos. They are the best around.",2
"the 'NEW Guide "" SUCKS, SUCK, SUCKS, looking at white print on a black background is like looking at headlights coming at you in the dark. there are 'rings' aound the letters for anyone over the age of 40. I guess Direct TV has all 20 y os workking in the home office. The 'cusotmer service' line takes a good 4 mintues to work though before you get to a human being. SUCKS.",1
I go here to Cash my paychecks and with most Station Casinos the Cashiers are friendly. The Valet's were friendly though over worked because they needed more of them. Having not been to the buffet in a while. It was good and they redone it. I recommend it to people. They have Gelato which i didnt try but the desserts were good. Bread Pudding was awesome.,2
"This dealership is a stealership when it comes to having your car service. I went to the dealership to have an oil change and then when my car was done they told me i have to replace my brake pads which cost 680 to replace front and rear, wow! i made a quick research when i was there on my iphone to search for the parts which only cost 154 that's a no brainer.",1
"I had the best experience here today! Amaya sorry if I spelled your name wrong, honey made me beautiful. I love him. He taught me how to contour my face and did the best eyeliner. He made me laugh and feel comfortable. You cannot go wrong here. These products are AMAZING. There was no pressure to buy things, but come on. It's Nars. How can you not love these products?",2
"The Pinnacle Grille is situated along a very scenic road, north of Scottsdale. nI found it on Yelp, and was nearby. nMy hubby and I shared the Nachos, which were very good, and split a burger. nThe food was good, the waiter was so friendly, and the day was beautiful, just sitting outside in the sun, on the patio. nIt's not a fancy place, but we really enjoyed our meal here!",2
"Good food service, but the two stars are for the prices. Eggs and hashbrowns shouldn't cost 18. Especially when portions are small. If you like basic food, okay service at four star prices, this is the place for you. MGM used to discount their dining because of the money they make on their gaming. Now they make a good profit off okay breakfast food.",1
"Great great place! The most underrated part of this place is the garden in back, which is not open too often other than in the summertime. When we eat here, I usually will get the shrimp po' boy, and follow it up with a few Great Dane Scotch Ales, my favorite Madison beer besides Capital Winter Skal.",2
I consider myself a pizza snob. Went in skeptical but was very impressed. Service was a bit slow but that will improve as this was their soft opening. But regardless it was worth the wait. Never written a review on Yelp before but just signed up to give this place props! Welcome to the hood and good luck!,2
"Strangely enough, I didn't come here for hot dogs, as my friend and I were lured by the huge plastic cup that was about a yard long. We filled it up with some pink lemonade and vodka and proceeded to go to town with it. I also picked up some chili cheese fries which were sufficient enough to hold the vodka we were drinking for the rest of the night. I should try the hot dogs next time, though.",1
"OMG I love this place, best breakfast place I've been to in Madison so far. The duck confit was amazing. They are super busy but the wait was totally worth it. Service was fast and friendly. I went when it was still a little warm outside when they had outdoor seating and the waitress still checked on us regularly. I will definitely go back. ",2
"It got remodeled so it looks nice. Too bad I can't say the same about the drive thru staff. I swear, they are always in such a rush that they screw up your order 70 of the time. It's annoying to repeat your order three times and they still screw it up. Can you guys slow the heck down enough to actually listen and pay attention please?",1
"I wasn't quite sure what to expect of this place, so expectations were low. Luckily, our experience exceeded expectations and I look forward to going back. Beware it is BYOB and you need to pay a corkage fee. We relaxed and listened to some great music.all within walking distance from our downtown loft you can't beat that!",2
The good weekly flown in special entertainment midgets to porn stars and location if you are already downtown. The bad its like a smokey frat house more than a strip club. The stage is small and on one side. It gets packed some nights and you can't get close to or hardly see the stage. Not the best dancers either.,2
"Nice environment, good location, decent service. Food is quite overpriced for what you receive. I recently paid 12 for a burger, plus upcharges for pretzel bun and sub sides. And it was certainly not worth the money. The meat was dense and somewhat bland. It tasted like it was prepared well ahead of time. There are better options out there for burgers at those price points!",1
Stopped in for breakfast. The restaurant has a fantastic open vibe. No issues with noise.from start to finish we had a great time! Brent provided excellent service and Doug made an unbelievable Bloody Mary. We ordered eggs and the lox plate. The dishes came with a side of potatoes. They were probably the best potatoes I've ever had. I would order both dishes again! Great job Fox Restaurants!,2
"I had never been to a sams before, so this was my first experience with them. Everyone has been super helpful and friendly from a service standpoint. all of the checkers are great and friendly as well. The people running the samples are great salesmen and saleswomen and know the product they are sampling. I guess I have no basis for comparison, but I am comfortable here.",2
"I don't know if I'm just crazy, hungry, or cheap but are the cheeseburgers here cheaper than in California? Anyway, one was 2.25 and I was definitely pleased with the price. Though I can't exactly say I was full, I did eat half of my sister's fries to compensate for it. My friends and I wanted a cheap meal before we went all out splurgy on the buffets and it definitely hit the spot.",2
"My wife and I visited Canonita once again and had a great experience. Mussels and shrimp appetizer, beef ribs, pork barbacoa, margaritas. All great. nThe waitress was a bit too busy however it was not to the extent that we were not taken care of. a couple times the dirty plates were left on our table too long which is a problem as the tables are very small. Great food and drink.",2
"Agree with most of what I am reading. My family had gone there for a while and the constant turnover, lack of knowledge relatively green and lack of communication totally turned us off to the point where I wouldn't go there anymore. If only the same attention put towards the radio show went towards the practice.",1
"Took over an hour half for a extra large pizza 30 estimated delivery time and we live 2 miles away, plus the pizza was COLD. Driver arrives and has no information for management. Called to complain and person on the other line SAYS they will send another pizza right away. 40 min later and still no pizza.",1
"Recommended to us by a friend, we came by to check out what they had to offer. There is a good collection of comics, anime items, collectibles and the like for any variety of fanatic or general enthusiast. The staff was friendly and greeted us when we came in. Things were well organized and easy to shop. Overall A nIf you are into comics or collectibles, this is a great spot to check out.",2
"Decent gas prices, high priced fast food, and beware if you have to go inside as lines move slow. For a quick fill I have no complaints. Works well for heading north on Dean Martin. The Burger King is more expensive than the one on LV blvd a mile or so away and not nearly as nice. My real trouble is the connivence store line move slow. And I'm always waiting.",1
"Good sushi but the ""all you can eat "" option has draconian rules. If there's a single piece left on your plate it costs a dollar extra 1 for maki, 2 for sushi . They'll actually watch over you like a hawk to see you eat it. Their menu is confusing to where it can cost you far too much for what you get if you're not careful.",1
"My daughter and I had lunch here today for the first time. Nice atmosphere, fresh chips, good salsa and hot sauce. My daughter loved her chimichanga. I had a combo with shredded beef taco, enchilada, rice and beans, all good. Plenty of food, we both brought home half of our plate. We are looking forward to coming again and trying some other things on the menu.",2
Only 2 high chairs in this restaurant? My son just sat on our laps the entire time. Not even sure if one opened up while we were here but we never ended up with one nonetheless. What's up with being so stingy with the nan? We get a basket to start but there's not enough and then you wait 20 minutes later for another one? Food selection is very slim too. There's gotta be better options in Vegas.,1
pretty good korean food. i had the spicy tofu soup and it was pretty tasty. one of the only places to actually sell kimchi pancakes so that was definitely a plus. my friend got the short ribs so those tasted pretty good as well. the place itself is very cute as far as the interior design and they had kpop as well as current popular songs playing loudly. super nice would definitely go again!,2
"I'm so sad how far downhill Porta Bella has gone since I was in college. While the romantic atmosphere remains, the food is awful. Our Bolognese smelled and tasted like Chef Boyardi Our waitress was so spacey and disinterested we had to laugh every time she left our table. I hope the owners can turn the menu around I think they need rescuing by Robert Irvine of Restaurant Impossible.",1
"Absolutely the worst restaurant to attend! Like we had to wait to get seated, we had to wait to order our food and we had to wait to pay for our bill. Like what the heck. All of the workers ignored is the whole time. I know they could hear us. But walked off like they didn't. Never coming back again",1
"It's nothing special, but depending on where u may be convenient and sometimes that's all that matters! Not much more than that. At 0.40 ounce it's higher than other places and only has 10 flavors to offer. Which isn't as many as the other yogurt places in town! It's mostly clean with a few TVs and service is average, not memorable. Therefore, if all were fair, I'd go elsewhere.",1
"I was 12 minutes late for my appointment for my daughter. Pulled her out of school to go to the appointment and was running a few minutes late. I even called and told them I was running a few minutes late. How many times have I waited at this doctor having arrived on time and waited 20, 30, 40 minutes ? Every time ! Ridiculous.",1
Holly frozen bar batman! nI stop in here every time I am in town. I have even on occasion closed the place. There is nothing better than than a hunourmous Chopin potatoe vodka martini. We even spent one night melting quarter into the bar. I imagine they love us there. nDon't forget happy hour. nOne of my vegas must do items.,2
If you plan on purchasing A groupon keep in mind that it does not work for online ordering. also you cannot make changes to any order that uses a Groupon so if you have allergies to anything that comes on the burger probably shouldn't purchase or use the Groupon. Cash only inside the store. Good luck,1
This was my favorite Roberto's to go to until the quality and customer service went to the dumps. what happened . the lady at the drive tru does not pay attention and has screwed up our orders several times we are over it not to mention the health department needs to visit this location its pretty dirty inside so we will no longer use this Roberto's till they clean up their act.,1
"At first I was scared to get a hot dog for delivery but the delivery lady was very polite and my food. Where do I start? nMy chili cheese dog was AMAZING. And the fries not crispy but were very delicious. And serving a strawberry crush soda in a bottle. Heaven has served me well. And the cheesecake. Oh bou, delicious. Good Job Jimmys Hot Dogs. I'll be back!",2
It was a great experience and what an excellent job Nick has done! Nick is very professional and he knows exactly what you want. It took about an hour and he shot about 100 pics for me in different angles and poses. It was a professional studio with all the necessary equipments including lights and backgrounds. Five stars and good job Nick!,2
"My Detroit dog and fries were very good. But, as others have said, it was too hot in the dining room. 85 deg is what I saw so not as bad as others at 90 deg but still unpleasant if you leave soaked in sweat. Won't be back in the summer time. Will go back in the winter if I have a hankerin' for a Detroit and fries!",1
"The food is great and the waitstaff always polite and friendly. Sitting up near the window at night is perfectly cozy. Late drink specials are a nice bonus. My only tiny issue is that I wish they offered more vegetarian options.I love the pastas and toppings loaded veggie burger, but I would love to try something new. No matter, I do enjoy going there and would recommend it to others",2
"Ordered a thin crust sausage, tomato, onion, and green pepper pizza based on all the great Yelp reviews. A group of us all tried it, although there was just something wrong with the taste. In the end we couldn't pin it, wasn't that good. Ended up tossing it. The breadsticks were much better, although nothing exciting to write home about. Can't recommend this restaurant.",1
"We ate here because the line for the Buffet at Bellagio was too long, and this place had no line at all. Prices were very good too, considering this was at Bellagio. Unfortunately the food and the service was sub par. The food was not good and barely edible. The service was just plain slow. With all of the other food options around, there is no way we would choose to eat here again.",1
"Yelp should add a category for how long you waited. I don't know about you but waiting an hour to eat is not my thing. Kona grill, the food is great the service is great and I walked in a 6 50pm and was eating 12 mins later. All the hype on these new places and waiting an hour to eat is for the birds. Besides you can't eat hype",2
"Love to shop there! They have everything from pre made sides to marinated Kalbi, Bulgogi, Chicken, Pork belly and Cutlets. And if you would like to make your own, they have all the ingredients you'll need there. I also love their Food Court. Sushi, some Hawaiian and Korean foods at decent price compared to DJK and some other Korean restaurants.",2
Went back to Korean Garden Saturday night with some family in town from out of the country and was so disappointed. My favorite salad was gone and replaced with what appeared to be bagged iceberg lettuce with tasteless dressing. The meat was bland. Plus the service was not up to par. I doubt we will be going back here and we have been long time customers.,1
Our waitress was great. But the service was super slow. Probably cause one person was taking table orders and waiting on every table. And 4 people standing up front not doing anything but talking to each other and playing on their phones. The owner needs to start managing this place. Very disappointing for a first visit. Better pizza places right down the street,1
"The best breakfast in Scottsdale! Huge portions, not lacking quality in anyway! Service is so nice and coffee delish! the new renovation makes it hip, classy and fun! Love the new ""bar ""! Lunch is also incredible! You will wait on the weekend for a table, but get a latte at the bar and wait, it's well worth it! Yum!",2
"Horrible experience staying here. We are in Vegas often, this was the first and last time I've stayed here. Staff was rude. Rooms are outdated dirty and not like the pics. They're called suites but are not very suite like. The room was dirtier after housekeeping than before. All in all terrible experience. Stay elsewhere!",1
"I have a misleading cited to shop at best buy again. I bought my laptop there in December, after an update it stopped working. Spent hours on the phone with the manufacturer who told me Best Buy would cover this they didn't care to even look at the computer. Its funny I brought it in the original box and packaging and everything. Horrible customer service.",1
"Wish I could like this place? Being close to where I live, but what do you expect? 1. Inexpensive Italian food inexpensive flavor. n2. Crowd snowbirds n3. Basic ingredients basic italian food. I will try my hand at spagehetti and meatballs, I think I have a 50 50 chance of doing it better? DIne here on the cheap.if thats what you are looking for?",1
"A friend invited me with her on a friday night.South East Vegas? What the hell is in South East Vegas? Haha but this place shut my negative criticism and she made my credible list. Great tasting middle eastern dishes, along with a huge selection of hookah flavor, good music, and good crowd, this became my favorite place to go with friends to smoke hookah and eat.",2
"Me and my friend came here on a Sunday. We ordered a Mac and cheese burrito which was delicious and chips and salsa. The server forgot to bring the salsa at first. We weren't even mad, but they were so generous and brought us bean dip with our salsa! The atmosphere is great and everyone is really nice. Will definitely return",2
"Somebody from 5 Guys left a contact number when responding to my review. I took some time out of my day and called them and answered all their questions. They asked for my contact info and said that somebody would get back to me. Nobody ever did. Employees are only as good as their bosses. If you don't care, why should they?",1
"I don't understand why this place isn't busier. The prices are great for Scottsdale. The drinks are cheap for Scottsdale, the buffet is huge. The food tastes great every time I go there. I just wish they opened the bar on the weekdays. We need to get the word out about this gem. Places like this needs to stay open!",2
"Since they are ""on the clock "" and getting paid, YOUR time doesn't matter! I don't care if you're buying a greeting card or having a prescription filled you will have to wait, and wait, and wait! If you need to practice patience, start somewhere else. This place is like the Stanley Cup without benefit of a stick!",1
Such a cool little place. We stop in for appetizers and wine every so often. We usually end up getting a pizza too. I think last time was a chorizo. nWe also take the suggestion of the staff regarding wines. They turned us on to one of our new favorites that we get for home now. nI almost hope people don't find out about this little spot. It'd be nice to have a little south side secret.,2
"Went for lunch on a Friday. There was hardly anyone there, so we figured we can get in and out fairly quick. Wow. Not even close! Waiter was 2 iq points above retarded and ridiculously slow! Took over 1 1 2 hours to eat lunch. About 20 mins of that was just waiting for the check. The only saving part was the pizza was decent. I would never go back.",1
The worst transportation service in Las Vegas! nPlease avoid. nI made the mistake of trying to save some money and purchased the round trip transportation to the strip and ended up waiting over 30min just to be told the next bus will take me. nNo refunds. So I ended up jumping in a cab. nTake Bell Trans same price and better customer service.,1
"This place has the best Thai food in the East Valley. Their Pad Thai is outstanding. One of their waitresses is a little crazy and you can't really understand anything she says, but hey, at least you know it's authentic Thai. My only complaint is that they don't have crab wontons on their appetizer menu!",2
"This place is the bitch sister of good poutine places. She promises things you like but does them half ass and lazy so you just want the date to end. Be starving and without a palate and you'll be fine here. Surprisingly enough, the poutine I had at Rue peel bar was worse. But that doesn't make this good.",1
"Solid diner with rock bottom prices. Kitschy atmosphere, elderly clientele. They know now to fry. The skillet dish is very good. Stick with the diner classics and breakfast. Old school menu choices like the Diet Plate. Delightfully authentic with zero pretension of being anything other than a solid diner.",2
Stopped in for mani pedi while visiting Phoenix. The experience is full of frantic upselling and side glances from the technicians. My nails were filed into an odd shape and the polish chipped the same day. The polish selection is small and some bottles appear thinned out. I was incredibly disappointed.,1
I really enjoyed my trip to this store today. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I cannot wait to go back and get more of a look when my husband has the children There were a lot of different yarns and patterns. I was also really interested in their button collection. Overall great store and service. Support local business.,2
"Very simple mantra. All is well, you're in The Bull. Great music, cheap ish booze, great atmosphere. What more does your average metalhead want? While I was there, the music veered from Soulfly, to Pantera, to Thunder, to Frankie Miller, to Metallica and all the way back again. Very few places would carry that off. Now, if I could just get on the pool table.",2
"Maybe its cuz it was my first time in Vegas, but the flamingo treated me well! We got the rooms at a very good rate and the room wasn't bad at all. We had a nice set up that had a good view of vegas. We did try the room service and the food wasn't bad at all. We had no issues and check in out was easy",2
"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Both locations are great, but I prefer the west side. They have over 20 vegetarian selections and I gotta tell you I am a creature of habit and I would eat here every day if I could. They have some of the most amazing salads, try the Bruschette Salad and the Athens Fries are amazinggggg.",2
Pizza is fairly good however the service is terrible. I've currently been waiting in line for over 15 minutes with only 3 people in front of me. On top of that they charge for refills. If u want good service go right across the street to johnnies pizza. They have even better pizza and great service!,1
"Love M C Sports! Great prices, good sales, friendly staff, good product selection. Did I mention helpful staff? Sometimes there is low employee coverage but hey if you happen to be there when there is a forcasted slow period you will still get what you want. M C Sports it is where you go for good prices, friendly staff and great sales.",2
"This is all you need to know n AWESOME and friendly family owned business n NON DAIRY gelato that consists of non fruit flavors. yes, you heard me correct, non dairy gelato with non fruit flavors! n NON DAIRY frozen yougurt n NON DAIRY shakes n NON DAIRY root beer floats So yeah, go there, support this business.",2
"It sells coffee and iced tea. It's drinkable. The lemon bars are good. Really, the big advantage Espresso Royale has is convenience it's two blocks away from the quad, and the prices aren't horrible. But I'm thoroughly unimpressed by the overall quality, and the place looks like a grad student's apartment a strange mishmash of chairs that sort of fit together. At least it's not another Starbucks?",1
"The absolute WORST airline on the planet. They may have a cheap ticket but then they nail you for everything under the sun. If they could charge for the air you breath, they would charge for that too. Then after you pay for practically a second ticket, the airplane are old and decrepit. I will gladly walk to my next destination then ever fly Spirit Airline again.",1
This was by far the best burger I have ever had. We had the euro burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger. Both were made to perfection! So tasty and an abundance of flavors! We had the parmasean fries which were sooooo delicious. The truffle aoli was amazing. We also had the cherry whiskey lemonade. The drink was strong and full of flavor. We will be back here for sure!,2
"Only one person working during the 2 5pm BOGO special .not good. The service was slow but she was very pleasant.unfortunately the drinks did not taste good and only 1 of the 4 drinks we had were finished. This stand is also ridicuslouly marked up.ventis are in the 6 range, wow. It's worse than other hotels for sure.",1
My first show and I loved it! It is magical and awe inspiring. My jaws dropped a couple of times and I was laughing and smiling a lot! All in all a GREAT show. I got splash zone tickets as they were the cheapest and it was a lot of fun as we could see a lot of the things up close just watch out for a little water.,2
"This place was straight up N.A.S.T.Y. nI am prior military so I have eaten some not so good meals. I'm not a picky person. I think you can pretty much doctor up food to be edible.that was until today! I took one bite of my tostada and I refused to eat anymore. I literally was grossed out and by the time the staff noticed our table, I wasn't even willing to order something else. I was disappointed.",1
"You have to visit this store! If you love original products that are useful and beautiful check it out! I recently purchased a back pack from here and took it all over Canada.hiking, biking, fishing and kayaking and it was a champion! The compartments were great so I could protect my wallet in a crowd.there is a nice water bottle holder as well. Most of all I can wash it and it is just like new!",2
"Michael rocks! Used to go to Polished Southend Myers Park , which is where I met Michael. When he told me he left, I thought I would just die. Until he told me he went to Modern Nails. He's the only one I fully trust to do my acrylics. He does an amazing fill in within 30 minutes or less! All his other clients from Polished followed him over here too. That's how great he is!",2
Picked it because its walking distance to my home but I like Dr W a lot so I'll keep him. Frames seem a bit expensive but I'm sure its average for good frames. I don't have the patience for the exam and to shop for frames in the same day so I usually end up getting them elsewhere. I do get my contacts here because it doesn't really require any work on my part and I like that.,2
Just moved here from Connecticut and this is beyond any Chinese I have had back home I've only eaten there once but I had the gang pang chicken and it was phenomenal I love that all their chicken is white meat which is a change of pace from most Chinese places where you have no idea what type of mystery meat chicken you're gonna be getting I definitely will be back,2
A family owned business for the last 25 years now that has great customer service and are very friendly. Saw it on Yelp and had to try since the other Thai place next to it was fully booked. Can't go wrong with this place which is why I give it 5 stars. In my top 3 Thai restaurants IMHO that I've tried.,2
"As a fast food joint my expectations are not high, but when you give me cool, somewhat soggy onion rings and a cold whopper dang! I love the onion ring sauce and am convinced they put cocaine in it. That saved my otherwise lackluster meal. Also, the drive through was fast. There, I said something nice.",1
I love this place. I love their AYCE but what sets it apart is also their cooked items are extensive and yummy. I could eat their salmon collar all day long! The fish is fresh and I love that they have a half price AYCE price for kids. I love Goyemon also esp. Bc they have half rolls but I'm not paying 27 for my 4 year old! Now if only I could get half rolls here.,2
"Horribly rude company! Booted every vehicle in the parking lot and played a ""chase me around the lot "" game in his truck when people were trying to get his attention about getting their boots removed several had young children . Profane group of men running this ""company. "" They were VERY reckless with several of the cars they towed out as well.",1
"I fell in love with this Scottsdale treasure a few months ago. Its the perfect place to grab lunch with friends, or to celebrate birthdays or wedding baby showers. I enjoyed the wild mushroom, spinach goat cheese tart, and a glass of chardonay, whilst sitting on the patio. It was such a wonderful experience. I look forward to my next visit there!",2
"I was whisked here right from the airport upon my arrival. I was tired, hungry, and grouchy and prepared to hate any place that didn't involve sleeping. I ended up sharing some fantastic potato chip nachos with my friends, and meeting some new friends, too. Decent beer selection, and I suppose in Vegas it's normal to have so many video poker machines in the bar that you can't set down a drink.",2
"This place was great. It is inside the Venetian. We sat at a table in the bar area, which over looked the gondolas going by. The drinks were strong and tasty. The chips were yummy and the guacamole was some of the best I have ever had in my life! Our server Danielle was fun and terrific and made the whole experience memorable. We will definitely be back.",2
Expensive and the quality is not always not always there. I bought a fresh chicken there 12.50 which is very expensive. Well when I got it home it was LOADED with feathers. It took 45 minutes to pluck the Fing bird. Now you can get chicken anywhere for 1.29 a pound. Here is nwas around 2.29 and I had to do all the work.,1
"I had an hour and a half layover in AZ and was starving so decided to try Nathan's. Unfortunately it was just ""food "" to fill my stomach and nothing special. nI ordered the chili dog that was around 3 it definitely tasted like 711 quality, nothing tasty or worth coming back for. nThe airport has alot of other places I'd rather try if I came back.",1
"I'm not a lover of their food, but the neighborhood location and two for one margaritas make up for it. Sort of. They have two good things on their menu, IMO the nachos and one of their beef burritos. All in all, I'd rather drive a little further and get some authentic Mexican from Laredo's at half the price.",1
"Stopped in with my boyfriend on Sunday night to grab a bite to eat on our way back to our room. By that time the restaurant was closed so we could only get pizza by the slice. They had pepperoni or cheese so we grabbed a slice of each. The pizza was very greasy. Unfortunately, we have both been sick with food poisoning ever since. Needless to say, we won't be returning.",1
Love this place. Going during the day is fun for the whole family. My 6 year old loves it. They have a desk for locals make sure to ask for it. The couches are cool and comfy. They also have a huge restaraunt and it looks very cool for a music venue. Can't wait to see a show. The fried chicken is delicious as well as the Stella cider.,2
I love this place! Stopped by in here today looking for breakfast and the decor caught my attention right away. My server Chris was very attentive and made great reccomendations. The food was really good. I recommend the ultimate breakfast cause the pancakes were delicious. I also got a iced coffee to go. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town!,2
"Came here tonight because my dog was having some serious problems eating and breathing. Called ahead, office said they could fit us in right away. Girls were friendly and efficient. Vet was wonderful and explained everything. My dog felt comfortable and got immediate treatment. Ended up having a salivary gland infection. Prices were also reasonable. Would go back without hesitation.",2
"If I'm lucky and they have them when the mood strikes, I love to pick up a sfogliatelle sfoy yah tell crunchy, triangle shaped Italian pastries kind of like a phyllo croissant filled with orange flavored ricotta and sometimes candied citrus peel and bring it home for breakfast with a nice cup of espresso made on the stove.",2
"This was one of my fave clubs in Vegas b c they played Hip Hop. I can only take so much EDM. But now, hip hop is no longer here! sucks. Was here LDW and was looking forward to the night we planned to go to 1oak because i knew they played hip hop, was SO DISAPPOINTED when I found out they stopped. Felt like any other club in Vegas that plays EDM all freakiight long. 1OAK, please bring back Hip Hop!",1
"This is our 2nd time here first time at the new location . The atmosphere and decor are very nice and the restaurant was clean. We were seated right away and immediately had someone bring us chips, salsa and beans. They were good but I prefer Coyote's chips better because they put seasoning salt on theirs. However, everything else was excellent!",2
"Went to La Chronique while on business in Montreal due to the stellar reviews on yelp. My only regret is not doing the wine pairing with the tasting menu. The entire meal was great, the service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was nice and quiet. Will definitely plan another visit when I'm back in Montreal.",2
"I absolutely adore the Old Town Farmer's Market. There is nothing better than waking up early on a Saturday and simultaneously enjoying the beautiful weather and wonderful produce. This place is packed with great local products from beautiful flowers to homemade dog treats. Even if you don't purchase a single thing, its still fun to browse and people watch.",2
"Mediocre food and service. It was clear my ""over easy "" eggs came out with a hard yolk but the server didn't seem to care. I ordered the huevos rancheros which came out drowning in salsa that looked and tasted like it came out of a jar. As other reviews stated, food quality was on par with Denny's but much more pricey.",1
"The food isn't all that great as I hoped it would. I ordered a steak burrito with pinto beans, brown rice, pico de gallo, sour cream, and cheese. The beans didn't taste fresh, the rice was a little hard, and the steak didn't look all that great either. I can honestly say the franchise Mexican grills taste better.",1
"We come to AZ once a year from California. Havana Cafe is one of our key destinations, and we try to eat here multiple times during our vacation. The food is to die for! Great selection of very authentic Cuban food. Plantains are amazing. Don't miss this restaurant. Yes, the plastic chairs could be upgraded to more comfortable chairs ",2
"just really funny how i try to buy a pet in there and whatever the lady calls him as a boss? and he doesnt want to sell it to us, he keeps making an excuse that the pet will die because the tank so small, and their tank just same size as mine. ridiculous. cuz we look like a kid is that why? but we are actually 19. never get in this place anymore!",1
"This was the 3rd time I tried Poppy's Place. Poppy's tries hard but the food is hit miss. The pizza bacon cheese bread were awful. Their crust is very dry, crunchy and tastes like a cardboard box. Their soups chili were very tasty, the salads weren't bad and their hamburgers were good but not the fries. It's not the worst place to eat but it is definitely not my go to place either.",1
"Menu du souper vari u00e9, bien ex u00e9cut u00e9, prix plus que raisonnable consid u00e9rant la qualit u00e9 des ingr u00e9dients. Service rapide et attentionn u00e9. La soir u00e9e s'est d u00e9roul u00e9e sans heurts et dans l'harmonie la plus parfaite, que dire de plus, sinon que je reviendrai encore et encore.",2
"The man who works there is ruining the business! He doesn't have any customer service skills at all! Go give your money to people who will do a great job on your nails and wax whom will treat you with some type of respect, especially when you are paying for them to stay open. How are they even staying in business?!",1
Best tire buying experience I have had with this car. My car has different size tires on the front and rear. This is the third set of tires I have put on this car and the first time I wasn't questioned about the staggered fit. Seth was great! Tires were ordered late on a Friday. Got a call early Saturday that they were in. They had them installed in under an hour! Great experience.,2
"I went for their lunch special, but they ran out of soup. They also ran out of eggrolls. They also ran out of curry. It took forty five minutes for them to make new curry. The extra star is for the service. Our waitress was very nice and apologetic about things which she couldn't control. After I ate, I also ran out. I'm not running back in either.",1
decided to try this place out on a Friday night but walked in and the place had an odd smell. Thought maybe it was just by the door so found a seat and sat down. ordered a drink and realized the horrible smell was through the whole restaurant. It smelled like rotten eggs and could not order anything to eat because the smell was so distracting. Drank our beer and left. We won't come back here!,1
"Basha's is a great store if you shop with children. The best perk is the child care center. The ladies who work in it are very nice and great with my kids. Basha's is a bit overpriced and does not carry everything, but it is good when I need a few sane 'mommy moments' to shop in peace. To me, that is worth the extra 10 I will spend there. Plus the pizza is amazing and a fantastic price.",2
"Tried them out at the Southpoint food truck festival a couple weeks ago after I saw very high marks here on Yelp. Sucked. How can you report to a food festival with EXTREMELY stale buns? The old, cold, crumbly bread made everything else taste like crap. What was worse is I waited in line for it. Not going back.",1
"While I was living at the Vdara Hotel for 4 months, I frequently visited the gym here. The staff is great and friendly. The gym was impeccably clean. They were always providing guests with free bottles of water and fresh towels constantly. I was able to stay in relatively decent shape amidst all the gorging of food and alcohol.",2
"Service terribly slow. It took 45 minutes to get fish tacos and chicken enchiladas! People who had arrived after us got served before we did. The margarita was too sweet. My fish tacos were really bland. The fish was battered and fried like ""fish and chips "" fish that was chopped up and thrown in a tortilla with some cabbage and chipotle mayo on top.",1
"Service Never ate in the store but delivery has always been good. The delivery time varies but always close to what was promised. Bonus no delivery fees. Food The two times that we have ordered from them did not disappoint. So far we have tried pizzas, wings, and garlic knots all of which were very good.",2
"I stayed at way worse, and I've stayed at way better. The price is definitely right. This place is definitely the most family orientated hotel casino on the strip if that's what you're in to. The customer service could definitely use improvement. If you're a low frills type of person, go for it. If you're looking for a Vegas experience, keep looking.",1
Donna's cakes are amazing and beautiful as well as delicious. I've ordered 3 so far. She makes a gorgeous Yule Log cake at Christmas with a mocha flavor and delightful decorations. I showed her a picture of a cake online I wanted her to make for my son's birthday that looks like a real train. She went above and beyond. I can't wait to drop by here for breakfast or lunch sometime.,2
This place is pretty great and it doesn't hurt that it is walking distance from my apartment. Really good food with more variety thaormal bar food. Great beer specials. There is a band that plays Thursday nights and they mostly do covers of songs that are fun to sing along or dance to. And.they have NTN. What more could you want?,2
Chinese MexicaRou Jia Mo Street Sandwich red braised pork 8.88. A little salty and greasy but tasty. It has an interesting 'English muffin' type bread and a juicy pulled pork filling. Be aware these portion sizes are itty bitty. I also ordered the 'fresh' squeezed papaya and mango juice. It tasted watered down and not sweet at all.,1
"the sides were dry and flavorless, the corporate team building event i was at had us sequestered in a back room away from the alleged light show, i had to sit next to my boss, but holy crap the steak was delicious. a heavily marbled rare new york strip crispily crusted with pepper? i'll take it. plus it had that sweet unmistakable taste of expense account.",2
"Seriously, what is with all the hype?!?!? nWe got lousy service and our food was gross. I am not at all a picky eater but their mole tasted like somebody just mixed in yesterday's burnt coffee over some chicken and tortillas and called it a day. nKeep searching yelpers, I'm sure there is better out their in Las Vegas.",1
"The only dive bar in phoenix that truly reminds me of my midwestern roots. Cheap drinks, great happy hour that's ridiculously long and cheap . You'd think that this would attract the less than desirable crowd to frequent swizzle, but I've only found great bartenders and patrons at this little bar. If you're in the neighborhood you've got to give them a try.",2
"The bartender was pretty cool as she was handing you drinks, she'd be real personable. But then when she walked away it was hard to get her attention. She would gab with a co worker over looking to see if any paying patrons wanted another drink. They have a ""two to mango "" drink that is pretty awesome! I would keep drinking that all night if it were up to me!",2
"i just made my way back from Vegas and like the blackjack table and the pool, i had to make my way to tacos el gordo. still the best tacos i've ever had and not very far from the strip a block past Encore . This place is simply a must try for anyone who even remotely likes tacos or authentic Mexican food.",2
Poor service. It took over a minute for him to get to the register with no greeting. The lone employee was on his phone and had to call them back because customers arrived. The order was correct. The dessert was good hard for him to mess that up . The bathroom was messy with no trash bag in the can. The common area was average.,1
"Been with them for 6 years and the quality of care has gone down. APPARENTLY calling a patient back with results is not a concern for them and they don't respond when you leave messages. No follow through with patient care, and the new staff acts like your a bother when you call. IMO a receptionist should not be giving me feedback from Dr. Finally jumping ship.",1
"WHen I think of the MGM grand Arena. Boxing is the first thing that comes to mind. Built for the sports venue and built in a way that regardless of your seat location, every seat has a good view. Great atmosphere, great crowd. Place is a bit older now and might need a small renovation, but its still a cool place!",2
This was my 4th time coming here and it was good every time with a great price portions are well over satisfactory. I ordered beef and broccoli my girlfriend got orange chicken both were fresh the broccoli was not soggy or over cooked like most places the orange chicken had great flavor and moist less batter and more chicken how it should be.,2
The food here is always not the way you ordered it. Also the waitress and managers will give you attitude if you ask for it the way you ordered it. Came to watch sports and have a beer you might be ok but the glasses taste like cleaner. Sports bar quality is was it is but this location is the worst!,1
"One of the best Indian buffets in Vegas for a great price 10.99. The curries are amazing and tasty. Spices were phenomenal. From the outside appearance it looks like a ""hole in the wall "" but the interior was clean and pleasant. Near strip, I highly recommend Mt. Everest. We would go there more often f we lived closer.",2
"I was not very impressed. nNot the place to go if your looking for antiques. nNo what I think of with the words swap meet. nI picture people bringing there cool stuff to swap or sell. nThis is mostly just a bunch of booths selling basic flea market pre made booth stuff. nThe air conditioning was nice, and the snake guy was neat",1
"I was referred by a co worker, we work just around the corner and always looking for new lunch spots. We went to their new location on Ray and Priest. I ordered the bacon jalapeno grilled cheese to go and it was so delicious. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try something new and flavorful.",2
"I've been coming here for years with my in laws. We always order the Shrimp Scampi with garlic oil linguine. The shrimp is so plump and wonderfully seasoned with garlic and oil. Very yummy! The salad and house dressing is always fresh and delicious. nI always go to the restaurant with the intention of trying something new, but I just can't resist my original order. Service is good.",2
"Went in for some quick take out. The only person available to talk to couldn't answer any questions. She didn't the know what was in any of the dishes and she couldn't tell me what dishes the pictures were of on the menu. I finally just chose two dishes that I was already familiar with just because I was tired of hearing ""I don't know. "" I definitely will not be back to this establishment.",1
"This place rocks. As good a sports bar as there is anywhere. Lots of TV's, great bar scene, food is above average and the service is first rate. You don't go there for gourmet meals, but for a sports bar, the food is well above average. Lots of 20 30 something single girls, which truly makes this place a great sports bar.",2
"Wow where has this place been and why have I not seen their sign before? I know everyone has already reviewed and oohed and awwed , which it deserves. But I am going to give it a better rating , it tasted great and my daughter liked it! Yeah! My nine year old enjoyed it and it was good for her. Now we have a place to stop for a bite before getting on the freeway.",2
"Just left this place after ordering sushi and waiting 1hr20min and left hungry. Food never came with Slow Hand Jack at the sushi bar.tho orders put in after ours were filled. We were given a table meant for 2 and squeezed our threesome in. And to top it off, we were still charged full price for our drinks and soup. LAME! Hana's on 7th Ave is the place to be! Take heed!",1
"What happened to this place? This was our college hang out. I stopped in for a happy hour with my college buddies. NOT the same. The happy hour buffet SUCKED! We ended up ordering appetizers. They tasted ok. Not much of a drink special. Oh, we were very disappointed. I guess the next college get together will be somewhere else.",1
"A great alternative to going to Pamela's in the strip if you don't want to wait for a table. This P G has a lot of the same menu items like the crepe style hot cakes and lyonnaise potatoes, as well as a variety of omelets. It's also an old school pharmacy, which adds some charm. The service is good and the prices are reasonable.",2
I had the loaded baked potato. That was a meal itself. Chicken and veggies are stuffed inside and and topped with melted cheese. My mom had the jerk chicken sweet potato. She said she liked it. I had the raspberry cheesecake for dessert and that was delicious also. I want to go back to try other things.,2
"This is my favorite place in Cosmopolitan. The white pizza is amazing and the PBR is affordable, especially given the touristy location. There are not signs indicating a pizzeria is even there, so when you do find the place it makes you feel like you discovered one of Las Vegas's hidden treasures. You can't beat unbelievable value coupled with great tasting food.",2
"I've eaten here and had to go from here several times all with great results. Today, I had a chicken burger to go. While I was eating, I noticed it tasted funny and gummy. Then I looked at the chicken.it was raw! Needless to say I now have food poisoning. Warning to all beware, if you're eating chicken from here only eat it at the restaurant.",1
So I have been here before and thought all was well so I'd try it again. Big Mistake. BIG. The boiled meat was way to chewy and guacamole was almost sour. It was particularly the fly infestation that grossed us out. Flies everywhere and this was inside not the patio! Beyond gross and the tables were disgusting. Won't be back again. Ever. Ever.,1
"Very fast and friendly service. This is definately a no frills place and there is nowhere to sit down and eat in the restaurant, BUT it is a great place for take out! The woman cashier I deal with every time I go up there always seem to know instinctively what my order is and she is always very nice and accommodating. The food portions are LARGE and everything is always very GOOD.",2
"It was one of the worst chain BBQ place I have tried. The side dishes was better than their meats. A little over priced for what you get as far as quality. All the meats we ordered was over cooked and dry, had to drown the meat with the BBQ sauce to get it down. Tried Dave's BBQ twice now just to make sure, won't be going back for a third.",1
"I am late in my review of Copperline Plumbing but certainly with such excellent service needed to chime in with everyone else. Gabe did work several times for my elderly mom. He was prompt, pleasant and totally honest. He made my mom feel very comfortable. His prices are great and so is he. If you want an ethical reliable plumber do not hesitate to call Gabe.",2
"Taking Trainer Jo's H.I.I.T. High Intensity Interval Training Bootcamp at City Athletic Club has done wonders with my body. She's a positive fitness instructor and makes people push their limit because she knows we can do it. It can be a challenging class sometimes, but in the end the results are worth it.",2
"i'm often stuck at 2am craving something, and with Bosa if its donuts I dont have to go to bed grumpy and disappointed. They corner the late night market and still put forth the effort to make the donuts fantastic. You can get ice cream and other treats here as well, with a drive thru window for the ultra lazy.",2
"Update I contacted OnTrac, and they looked into the issue, and they said either the package was mis scanned or mis delivered. The package did show up on my door the next morning I'm not sure what happened but was relieved that I finally did receive the package. Amazon was very responsive as well, so I have to give them props for that.",1
"Went here again recently and noticed that they had spruced up the place. nIt's always been a hole in the wall, and that's its charm to me. The new decor just makes it a little more comfortable. I've always enjoyed the food, usually getting the Jordan w fries and rings, and always go away with my occasional hot dog craving satisfied. This last time seemed to be better than ever.",2
"Too many slots, and not well laid out. There are very few table games, so the few they have tend to be overcrowded. The bars were overpriced and understocked. There was a three hour wait to get into the restaurants, but they wouldn't take reservations before hand. For my first trip to a casino, it was fun for a while, but that quickly wore off. I wouldn't be inclined to hurry back.",1
"Great Indian and Pakistani food. I always make a point to go there and try the chicken biryani, butter chicken, chicken tikka boneless, chicken fried rice, shrimp fried rice, tandoori chicken. Etc. It's all delicious. nBut there is no parking nearby. It's always difficult to find a decent parking spot. Other then that the food is great.",2
"Over priced, over crowded and every time I have been there.it has confirmed that they pour the worst martini! nBut if you are looking to 'people watch' this is the place the interior permits a great open ambiance with an open area overlooking the bar. I think the exhaust system isnt strong enough for the Teppan tables because I smell like heavy fried food when I leave!",1
"Never been to a more disgusting and dirty store in my life? Guess they do not know how to shampoo their carpet? You see carpet stains every where at this place. Clothes just thrown back on the racks, just a cheap place. Noticed everything here is made in China, so don't expect anything from here to last!",1
The food is so freaking good and they even have take out online for when you don't want to talk to another person. The restaurant staff are friendly and personable . Super chill vibe but it had a ton of famjams going on when I went in. The restaurant does not feel like you are in the bar even though they are attached. I will eat here again!,2
"My review can be summed as I didn't love it. To put in another way this joint is perfectly mediocre. Mediocre service, mediocre menu, mediocre food. I won't and don't go back even when there's a wait next door at Sakana Sushi . I had the Rustica basically a giant, extra doughy, over priced slice of pie. Did not love. My friend had an unmemorable pasta dish.",1
"I had the southwest turkey sandwich which had Turkey, sweet roasted red peppers, southwest sauce and pepper jack cheese. Topped with mixed greens and avocado.it was soooooooo good. I couldn't eat all of it.very filling. The waffle fries were really good, well seasoned. Next time I will have to have a beer!",2
"After several bad experiences with landscapers in the area I am very glad that I found C A in Yelp reviews. He is the most knowledgeable landscaper I have ever found. He understands what our type of plants in Arizona need. Outstanding work, great prices, on time and professional! Will never use any other service!",2
"After agreeing to meet a friend here, as this was Her favorite spot. I showed up on the wrong ""party "" night. nIt was extremely loud and chaotic. nI attempted to order a drink at the bar while I wait for Her, and with NO luck. nWe decided to go next door to another space. nPerhaps you might want to try the space on a slower afternoon?",1
"We have been coming here for a couple of years. The food has always been good, but lately I have noticed an extra effort on a part of the staff to be more attentive and professional. We also noticed that the menu has been completely revamped. The food is very fresh and the chips were light, crispy and warm. Prices are reasonable too.",2
20 years I waited for this slop. Everything was lukewarm at best. Desserts that were supposed to be cold were warm. My 17 dollar cocktail gave me a good buzz for 5 minutes so 1 star for that. 2nd star is for service. Remember people.its a buffet. Lower your expectations or you will be slapped in the face by disappointment like myself.,1
"Only one thing to say about Thunder From Down Under Show BORING! nThe dancers appeared tired and like they were just going through the motions. nMarcus, the host, was the only dancer who's routine was worth watching, and his time was for about 2 3minutes, prepare to be bored until his performance. Go see Chippendales at the Rio instead, for girl's night out their show is much better!",1
"Food is average, not the best, not the worst. Promptly seated, chips, salsa, drink order taken right away. Two different visits, two different servers, months agpart both forgot to place 1 of the 2 orders that my party of 2 placed. Not overly busy either time during lunch, so really no excuse for it.",1
"I really did not enjoy my experience here. I had the Three Cheese Macaroni and it was soupy, watery and basically flavorless. We went in for a late lunch, and I don't know if they hadn't had a chance to clean up from the lunch rush or what, but it seemed quite dirty. Not impressed, can't imagine I'll be going back.",1
"Next time you are Uptown Charlotte, try Bbq pork or chicken or ribs at Oneway SmokeHouse , . You can't go wrong here . This quick lunch place rocks the bbq . 5.00 lunch special works , classic eastern North Carolina style baby. The Owner and Staff really go out of their way to service You , and if you don't know what You want , they will plate a little of everything for You to please your hunger !",2
"I just want Jon from mermaids to leave me the same generic response he writes to every review. This place is definately NOT clean and sanitary. It closes late at night, and there are no table games. It's just a bunch of old school slots that pay in real nickels and quarters. That's it.nothing more,no bells and whistles.",1
"I haven't been here in several months, but I used to dine here regularly when I lived in C U. I never had any major complaints I had several GREAT meals here brunch dinners, including one dinner with great live music . If I could find anything wrong with Luna it is, as others mentioned, the service. The waitresses are hit or miss sometimes excellent and sometimes moody incompetent.",2
"This LA Fitness is one of the nastiest gym I've been to. Equipment old and scattered, place is dirty, restrooms are even worse! The place smells like a bowling alley. Most of the equipment are also broken, I had to get on, on 3 diff treadmills. I'm pretty sure you'll walk out of there sick! I think prison have better equipment! !",1
"We were just recommend Arrowhead Grill two months ago and we've been there 3 times already. Amazing steak and their Chilean sea bass is some of the best we have had. It can get pricy once you order sides, wine and an ap but it's worth it. Service is great and atmosphere is cozy. Really great pricing on their food and bar menu during happy hour if you sit in bar or on patio.",2
"While conveniently a mile from my home and the guy handling the check in and out process is pleasant my car has taken twice the time of a dealership as one of the mechanics has spent the majority of his time arguing and cussing at a woman on the phone girlfriend or wife . As a result, my car sits while his personal life is more important than the customer.",1
I got in line at 11 30 AM for lunch and waited about an hour. The place looked elegant but I though with the pricey vegas entrance there would be more of a selection. Desert was just okay. No crab legs on a sunday afternoon. I prefer Planet Hollywood or Mandalay Bay for a better taste of variety. plus mandalay on sundays have mamosas and crablegs for lunch.,1
"I had a connection here recently coming back to Charlottesville I was surprised how HUGE this airport was for a 'smaller' airport. It is very spread out which means you could have a really long walk from concourses, but it has a nice variety of shops and restaurants in between. I have ti give them major props for having a Jamba Juice as well ",2
"Beer Advocate and Yelp were spot on with their review here. Superb service by male female bartenders who doubled as wait staff. Great craft beer selection and solid unique pub fare. Shared the guilt of of caloric filled dining cheesy goodness of Mac and cheese w shrimp large salty pretzels and 6 deep fried Oreos w ice cream drizzled w hot fudge on top! If you're in town, definitely worth a visit!",2
"Ive been going into Dylan's for about 9 years and it never gets old. The customers are great and I've made some life long friends. The bartenders are always friendly and ready to have a good time. The only thing that could make them better is if they accepted credit debit cards. But if youre ever on the east side of town and need a laid back fun place to hang out in, check it out!",2
We ate dinner for Thanksgiving. THe lights were so dim that we had to use the our phones to read the menu. Food portions were large. THe server clained it serving size is for 1 2. She was absolutely wrong.was enough for 4 5 folks. Bottom line is that we had ordered a lot of food based on her recommendation. The server looked like she was high or just a ditz!,1
"4 girls, Wednesday night Server was uneducated about the menu. nFood was ok nMaggiano's Salad tasted odd. Only two of us tasted it then sent it back because of the smell odd taste. The two girls that tasted it one being me spent the next day with stomach pains and me in bed with an explosive situation from both ends if you know what I mean Food POISONING?! NOT GOOD! Can't return.",1
"I've been here a couple of times. They serve pretty good pizza here, the crust was fairly thin but had a good layer of cheese on it. I've also had several of the verdure vegetable sides and think they are done very well except kind of oily . You can get three verdure as a dish, which is a good option for vegetarians and is reasonably priced and filling. Love the ""outdoor "" seating area.",2
"This is the best Mortons of the six we have visited. If I'm going to drop 200 for dinner for two no wine or drinks then this is where I want to do it. The bone in Filet Mignon was so tough I had to put pressure on my fork to cut it. The prime rib for two amazing. The jumbo Lump Crab cake devine, the carrot cake fantastic. nAsk for Mark Amirr.",2
I purchased my MDX here over a year ago and can't say that I've ever had a nicer car buying experience. Everyone from the salesman to the finance guy to the cashier at the service desk was so friendly. I go back to get my oil changed there and it is seriously the most pleasurable oil change you'll ever get.,2
"35 of us opted to have a wedding rehearsal dinner here and we are glad we did! Serving 35 people is no small feat but the staff handled the task with ease! The private room was tasteful, inviting and spacious. The food was amazing and everyone really enjoyed the flour less chocolate tart for dessert! Thank you to the fish market and their staff for a wonderful start to the wedding weekend!",2
"I have been here about 4 times now and so far my experience at this comedy club has been one of the best in Las Vegas. 3 out of 4 times we really enjoyed the show especially when Brad Garrett himself performed. It's a must see event when he's in town. Well stocked bar, clean and in the newly remodeled Tropicana.",2
"Yummy as always. Diego from the var knows how to make my favorite cocktail, the Derby with Bookers . Escargot good as always and the goat cheese is so incredible creamy and delicious. Wow! I did ask for ""Spanish Anchovies "" white on my salad, but got Chilean brown instead. Big difference! Please learn. Otherwise, an amazing grastronomical experience. Our waiter is amazing!",2
Slow! Told it would be a 10 15 minute wait for a table. After 25 minutes we decided to take a seat at the counter. Our meals took at least 45 mins and then it was luke warm! Managers are aware of the situation and gave us a hefty discount. They asked us to 'not give up on them '. I respect their honesty and will try them again.,1
"Absolutely awesome horseback ride! Beautiful views great tour guide Jim and I can't not mention Rocky the tour dog. We took the last ride of the day and it was gorgeous. Went through water, saw the sun starting to set and just had a fantastic time. Oh and the two bald eagles and wild horses we came across were just another added amazing bonus! We will be back!",2
"Pho broth was clean, NO MSG, and the noodles herbs were fresh. Some people might think that the broth is bland , but that may be because they are so use to the overload of salt and MSG. I also ordered the mini bun xeo pancakes appetizer which was tasty. Really great hidden mom and pop joint. EXCELLENT SERVICE! Go support them!",2
"The place is very small just 6 chairs. Stopped by for an early lunch 11 30, was the only person there. I could tell that they weren't ready for business. After waiting 15 minutes for the fryer to warm up I told them to cancel the fries and settled for just the green hornet topped beef dog which was VERY salty, nothing special. I probably won't return.",1
"The guy in the store was nice enough, but the mattress we bought is terrible. Had to do a warranty replacement after a few months. Then, after a year or so, called them again. The clown who showed up tested the very center of the mattress instead of the place we showed him had a problem. I'll never shop with Mattress Firm again.",1
"A lot of masses here to choose from. There's even a 4 00 one, which is very convenient on a Sunday when you want to get out of town. The main physical feature here is a lot of large bronze statues that are pretty cool. Last time I was here there was an older bearded priest with a east coast accent. He was excellent, very holy.",2
"Small little hidden place, but worth a try. When i visited Peru, i was amazed how many Chinese restaurants there were. After returning to the States, I really missed it because it had a different flavor than the Chinese food i was use to. Well Little Dumpling Chinese Peruvian has really good Chinese food, and their Peruvian Food awesome as well. Definitely worth a try.",2
Great selection at this salad bar type place! Pros nWon ton chicken salad nEdamame nFat free honey mustard nBlueberry muffins nCoconut muffin limited time! nChickeoodle soup Cons nLots of slow elderly people nNo warm dessert when I went at lunch nBalsamic dress not a fan! Truly a decent casual spot to stop in and eat fairly healthy. The lady clearing tables was extremely nice!,2
"Great beer selection. About 8 taps, all of which are solid. Nice low key atmosphere. Food is reasonably priced. Sandwiches and entrees between 6 12. Brutus salad is interesting, but overdressed. Mahi mahi was flavorless but fishy. Fried tomato sandwich without much inspiration, but they weren't cheap on the bacon.",1
"Very dated, not in a cool retro way. Ridiculous how you have to wait outside in the waiting room before our party. Can't go in early to settle in. Private party room is very small 10 max. I suggest reserving tables for parties of 10 Food and pitchers are crazy expensive pizza is decent but small. This place is not worth the price needs to be updated",1
"UPDATE! IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER! Not only does 32 Shea have THE best beverages in town my new fave is a slow, gravity dripped iced coffee toddy and killer pastries food.they now have a liquor license and serve alcohol a true bistro! The outside patio is complete and looks amazing! These guys are really hitting their stride! Check 'em out!",2
"This place is the worst,my girlfriend ordered the chopped salad and it was just a bowl of lettuce we complained and they said it would be extra for the ingredients that already should be in the salad they can't even pour an ice tea right it tasted like it was mixed w soda overpriced and nasty dirty food beware!",1
"What a let down. I have heard about this place for years so I finally had the time to try it out and in simple words, everything was a disappointment. Nothing was fresh, the crab legs were dry aged rubbery. The service was good, and I don't want to discredit their work and service but the food was garbage. Now I am full, but still feeling hungry because none of my taste buds were satisfied.",1
"Do not use this company. We called to have our A C repaired and Flores said they would have to replace the compressor, WITHOUT LOOKING at the A C. nCalled another company, they sent someone out with an hour and replaced a compressor motor condensor. 20 minutes and fixed. FLORES is looking to RIP YOU OFF!",1
"LOVED THIS PLACE! This place offers the best of. nService was awesome, includes the hostess, the bartender and the servers. I was in Vegas for a few days and tried SW for the first time, and all I can think about now is the Rib Eye and especially the Truffle Creamed Corn. YUM, makes my mouth water just writing to you about it. YUM!",2
"Have been to the Chandelier Bar several times on different visits. On our most recent visit, service was nonexistent we had to go the bar if we wanted a drink and the drinks were not very good. The bartenders were disinterested and not very knowledgeable. I can't comment on the waitresses because we never saw any. We'll be skipping it on our next stay.",1
"I honestly believe it is in their policy to make you wait a minimum of 30 minutes when you get there. There are 12 counters and never more than 3 employees working them. If your reservation is incorrect you Must go Online yourself and rebook it, they can't do it for you or do walk in reservations! Extremely disappointing!",1
"OK maybe 11 2 stars. Service was average. Caesar salad too lemony. Steaks way oversalted before cooking nearly inedible . Baked potato average. Saut u00e9ed mushrooms excellent. Gelato good. We probably should have returned the steaks, but on the other hand, a steak house should know how to prepare them.",1
"All the 5 star reviews are dead on accurate. This place is great, the owner is always there, customer service is off the charts and most importantly the pizza and calzones are always cooked to perfection. Really great dough and high quality ingredients easily make this the best pizza joint in town. Jason",2
Was not that scary! Lines are out of control. nGo during the day and skip paying high price for scarowinds and waiting in lines. nMazes not scary and hard to find them nWill not go back to scarowinds and will tell people to just go to carowinds nPaid 285.00 for six people and they got in 2 rides? That's is awful. And a few people scared us as we walked.,1
Original yogurt and skinny strawberry these have got to be the best EVER Always a fun experience. Cleanliness and high standards must be SOP. Location is always clean regardless as to how busy it is! helpful staff always willing to make suggestions and answer questions! Will be back many many times!,2
"My go to breakfast place. It makes you feel like you aren't in Vegas anymore. The ambiance is great, the staff is attentive and the menu is extensive. I love their bloody Mary's and they even sell the mix and hot sauces! The eggs Benedict is one of my favs! Can't wait for the weekend and to make a visit to this place again!",2
"Best taqueria in North Vegas, period. Maybe even all of Vegas. I usually go with tres azada tacos , dos de pollo and dos al pastor. Get some guacamole too, which they serve in a styrofoam coffee cup. Wash everything down with a mandarin jarritos mexican soda, and you'll be golden! This place is the bomb, and reasonably priced. Sketchy shopping center though.",2
"A great alternative to the insanity that is Giant Eagle Market District in Shadyside. While the selection may not be as good, the quality and price of most items is pretty damn good. Parking is pretty good much better than Giant Eagle , though the shopping center can get a little crazy during rush hour. Recently got some veggie burgers there that were amazing!",2
Although the people there generally don't know what they are talking about. They sure have good stuff at really cheap prices. I been a fan for years now! What I like about this store is your ability to have choices. There are a lot of variety of electronics and parts that you choose from at our own budget. They also offer services such as tech support and installation with stuff.,2
"Horrible customer service! Sat in the drive in repair area for over 30 minutes without acknowledgment, only to be told they couldn't assist me. Mind you the store and services bays were near empty, and it was 3 hours before closing. All this for a simple nail in the tire. I'll be having AAA put the spare on in their parking lot and going to Discount Tires, tomorrow.",1
"I have to agree with the reviews below. This place is dirty, the people are not professional and frankly I don't trust them with my car. If you are ieed of a quick inspection I guess they will suffice, but I also get the feeling they will tell you you need work you do not need. Things such as new wipers that allow them to turn a quick buck.",1
"Our first time to a Five Guys. These hamburgers were delicious! Of course, it would depend on what you have them add on the burger probably. Mine was a single, no cheese, with the usual good stuff like lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and grilled onions. I asked for the barbecue sauce and that was very tasty. The fries were also very good. Clerk was friendly and pleasant. Restaurant seemed clean.",2
"Yummy food served up fresh and quick. I tried the Chicken Skewer Plate. For 8.99 you get a chicken skewer seasoned grilled just right , couscous light fluffy with a variety of mixed squash zucchini, kabocha butternut , cucumber feta salad cool refreshing , hummus different than others I have tried but good and pita bread soft warm . Restaurant is clean cozy. Service was excellent.",2
"JD's Automotive has been my preferred mechanic for several years. I've went to other shops due to convenience and always end right back at Jeff's shop. I've referred many friends to him and ALL of them are now regular customers. Highly recommend honest mechanic's are hard to find but I assure you, Jeff and crew will take care of you and your vehicle.",2
"Birthday dinner for the gf and another couple. We were all speechless. It was the best thing we ate all week. Incredible service, incredible food, great atmosphere. nI got the triple threat thing with 3 cuts of meat with 3 different toppings. This was.orgasmic. You get what you pay for indeed. Beginning to end.",2
"DO NOT LIVE HERE! My daughter has been continually harassed by a neighbor. She does not feel safe in her own apartment. When management was notified, they basically called my daughter a liar. We are now involving the police. Side note Said neighbor was arrested for ASSULT in 2012. NOT A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE.",1
"The shisha is really good, but the decor is really bad with no theme. Everyone has to order a drink in order to smoke. And if you want to drink alcohol you have to order food. Your friend cannot order to eat and you drink the alcohol, if you drink you have to eat. They only accept cash, there is a machine to take out money who doesn't work well and takes time. The service really sucks!",1
"Great location in the middle of the Forum shops, a perfect place to give your poor dogs a rest and people watch. The food is good not great, but good. I had soup and bread with my wine, others had pizza and said it was yummy. This place is a little on the expensive side, but that goes with the name. Then again, everything is on the expensive side in Vegas! Sit outside and enjoy the free show.",2
"LOVE the BBQ flavor of the meats here, all are good. We didn't like the sides much though personal taste? . It would be nice to have a few kid options and maybe some smaller choices for when you don't want a HUGE meal but a smaller one. Other than that, Oh Yeah! What a gem hidden away get some more advertising!",2
"I brought my wife here for our anniversary and we came as a family for my birthday. Both times it was an enjoyable evening with great views, great service, and great food. I like to ""wow "" my family from out of town on what a great place the Phoenix Scottsdale areas are. This is one of the true bright spots. I will be coming back again and hopefully for the bar lounge scene.",2
"They should have called the the best western. After booking through Expedia we were charged 21.50 per night resort fees. We could have stayed at Aria or someplace nice! when we complained they said the fee pays for water, gym, spa, wifi. The wifi was so bad and after many complaints we used our 4g hotspot. We got one resort fee refunded. Avoid this hotel it's outdated and too many hidden costs!",1
"This location on St. Catherine is simply a better choice for this chain. The seating was efficient. Our server was prompt despite how busy it was , and both personable and courteous! His recommendations for steak and their preparation was great, and we were immensely satisfied! The creme br u00fbl u00e9e was not as expected, but it was decent. Not a bad experience at all.",2
That chicken smells really good for lunch nThe chicken is good but the staff is not very knowledgeable and have a bit of an attitude problem the place is always crowded in that order is never accurate I always have to send it back because it make lots of mistakes I don't know what's going on here but I would be cautious when you eating at this place.,1
"Whhyyyyyy? Why do I get dragged here at least 3 times a year? The former location off of Shea was a little better but not by much. Drinks way overpriced. Douchebag factor high. Bartenders and security are rude. One time I went to the DJ for a request, for some fun 80's hip hop. He gave me a dirty look then ignored me. I had the food once, and I totally regret it. It was bad, bad, bad. Ugh.",1
"Food was almost average couldve been better had hot wings and fries blah!.Service incredibly slow on a friday afternoon,had to take my tab and go find the waittress to cash out.Guess cant wrong with the drinks and bottled beer here only miller and coors on tap .Sports on tvs all over gives it 2 stars.",1
"Their pizza is great! .when it's not late, cold, and wrong. Our order took two hours to get to us, with no explanation or apology. We discovered our pizza was thin crust not what I ordered and stone cold. I am just glad I ordered through GrubHub, who gave me a 10 coupon to make up for it. Not worth it! Until I see better reviews, I'll order elsewhere.",1
" BEWARE Do not go here! Brought my car here, they took it to the back, then wanted to show us damage ""prior "" to working on it. They showed us the whole door panel broke. It was not that way prior to them taking it to the back, they then told us to ""have a nice day "". Horrible people! Hopefully people will listen and put them out of business!",1
This is one of my favorite Italian Restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. I am gluten free and they now offer gluten free pasta! YAY! The sauce that they put on their seafood pasta is amazing.very good flavor. Sometimes the service is not all that great but overall this place is a good stop if you like pasta.,2
"This is the only major Korean market in Vegas so I come here often. They have pretty much everything I need. The customer service could be better. The cashiers never say hi. Also, I don't like how they stopped using the reward card. Other than that, there really isn't any better Korean market in Vegas so this one will have to suffice. p",2
"Ryan and his assistant came out to my house today to clean out the dryer vent. They were on time, professional, friendly and did a great job for less than other people I called. It was hard to find someone to come out on a Saturday for just cleaning the dryer vent. I would definitely recommend Ryan and his team to anyone.",2
"I love the concept of sitting at the bar, watching the chef whip up jambalaya, mussels in a wine sauce or chowder. nThe portions are huge. I feel like I'm almost sitting some place on the East Coast. nWe ordered a huge bowl of chowder that came with crab and prawns. It was too salty for my taste. nUnfortunately, after we were doing eating, I only felt regret.",1
Restaurant is nice. We got the 2 enchilada plate which is the shredded beef enchiladas and the Monterrey plate. Everything was pretty disgusting. It tasted like what my cats food smells like. We had a bunch left overs that we had no desire to take to go. I ended up feeling sick to my stomach later in the night. The only decent thing they had was the chips and salsa.,1
Best Day Spa EVER! I'm a local and whenever family friends are in town I take them to try a new day spa. My best friend was here so we wanted to try Caesars. We did a day spa pass for 45 for the whole day. 6am 8pm. These pictures don't even do this spa justice. It's by far my number one spa. So amazing.,2
Stopped in for the first time as i was in this shopping center. Bring from NYC I know bagels. Had a everything bagel and lox. 5 star food. What I did not like was the deferred maintenance on some of the chairs. just covered with duct tape. looks very run down in those areas. but I definitely would return,2
I had just started my Production Company and needed some photos to post on my website. Yaer not only provided a photo shoot but also got some great candid photos from our rehearsal. The pictures were so great that I have hired him for my last 2 productions as well. He has such a beautiful eye and captures things that are unexpected. A big thank you to YB Photography. You rock!,2
"Hip, stylish, lively atmosphere. Excellent service. Delicious, interesting food. I can't think of what else you would need in a restaurant. FABULOUS! The street corn, duck carnitas, pozole, pork shoulder tacos, and avocado margaritas EXCEPTIONAL! were outstanding. I wouldn't recommend this place for people who are hard of hearing, because it is a bit loud. Otherwise, this place is perfect.",2
"I stayed at this hotel for a friend's bachelorette party. I was told that this place was amazing and it was really good. So i had to go try it for myself. At first, I was a little discourage because I was REALLY hungry but, the line was REALLY long. But, they moved fast and it was worth it. The sandwich was pretty amazing.",2
"The Ceviche was amazing! Was surprised that this place was able to pull off such a dish! We ordered a dishes but by far, Ceviche was the best. Service is great! Our server, Eddie was phenomenal! The atmosphere was relaxed, not too crowded but just busy enough to give the place life. The only thing that keeps me from going back is parking at Aria. What a mess that is!",2
The staff is friendly the manager is very nice . BUT DO NOT GROOM your dog here . The girl cut both my dogs very bad . She cut my maltese skin . and part of my yorkies ear OFF . He had to go to emergency vet is still not healed . It makes me sick and so sad for my hurt doggies . My poor yorkie has to still wear a cone and is not his playful self.,1
"The woman who helped me pick out my frames was amazing. Being my first pair she went through all my options to find something that looked good on me. The doctor I saw explained everything to me so that I understood, he went a little fast for me but that's ok. The techs were not that friendly and they had me going back and forth a couple of times because of the machines stopped working.",2
"Awesome caesar salad. Really. I love their caesar salads. which is kinda weird to say about a steakhouse. I don't care. I LOVE THEIR CAESAR SALADS! I did once order the porterhouse for two, and it was ridiculously large. Like, it could have fed a family of Somalians for a year. or a black bear. it was freakin' huge!",2
"The TSA agents here are so rude and don't even give you an opportunity to put your items in the bin before they basically tell you to hurry up and push them through. The only reason I gave an extra star is because southwest has always been wonderful through any airport I have traveled through with them, which is many.",1
"We came here to watch the US in the World Cup It was a perfect place for this. The beer options are limited light or dark , but the beer is good. We split a meal H u00e4hnchen , mostly to help absorb some of the beer. I love sp u00e4tzel, so this was perfect. Don't come here expecting a gourmet meal, or you will be unhappy. It has a great atmosphere and good vaguely authentic German food and beer.",2
"inside the Bellagio Hotel is The best restaurant in America ! . n Sea food platter for a table of 10.get your scuba gear ready and dive.I've never seen a presentation like that,.totally awsome. The Steak Garlic mashed potatos, wine selection to die for, . The Art Deco decour is out of this world, phenomenal service, everything is just extraordinary.I wish I lived next door.",2
I'm a fish taco junkie and this place is my Graceland! I haven't tried the majority of the menu because they always have multiple daily specials and it's hard to pass them up. I usually sit at the bar which has a great selection of brews and an always pleasant tender which adds to the laid back vibe!,2
Drop and go. I work nearby and we now have this down pat. I drive up. they take my car. Pay for the basics. and wave goodbye. Couple hours later I stop back with a tip for the crew out back. Rinse and Repeat. See ya in three weeks or after it rains. I even bring lunch to the manager every once in awhile to show my appreciation. Thanks guys!,2
"Save yourself a trip! Management was very rude to us after my 5 year old son got severly ill from their chicken dish, apparently the waitress could not tell us what was in the sauce and we had to run out of the restaurant and was severely ill all weekend from the food they served. I will not go back to this restaurant and do not recommend.",1
"Mmm.do not think I will ever go back to this place again. Our party only went because we were at nine fine irish men and they offered free cover. But inside, you will find a small, dank crevice of a space with coed bathrooms. The crowd I experienced was seedy and shady to match the environment. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE !",1
"A quite delicious breakfast brunch spot with outstanding fresh food. Mimosas are very good, bloody Marys are a little heavy on the horseradish for my liking. Coffee is ok. Outdoor seating only and out door heating for chilly mornings. If you're in the mood for a nice breakfast nook of a spot with ""can't go wrong "" dishes, this is a place to be.",2
"Really manager, you want to argue with me when I was given clearly a days old croissant and thought you should know?! Not even worth arguing. Extra star is because they gave me a small glass of water with no hassle. I actually wanted to buy their bottled water but it was room temperature for whatever reason.",1
decided to go out for a late night dinner and ended up at tgi Fridays in the Orleans. Our server's name was Julie.I think. Gave us the WORST service ever. Looked like she was in hurry because she dropped off our and check at the same time. Like expected us to just eat and leave. So we tipped her the minimum of 15 because of her lack of service.,1
I am obsessed with Shellac manicures and the places I've gone to in the East Valley have been hit or miss so I chose to visit this place via Yelp. Warner Nails is an absolute hit. The staff are warm and never pushy and their prices were very reasonable. My nails have been chip free for 2 weeks now and I'm looking forward to heading back for another mani pedi.,2
"I'm glad we tried this place. My hubby ordered BBQ pork fried rice which was sooo delicious, I had the Tom Yum which was so delicious too hot and perfect flavor. Place was clean and we experienced great fast friendly service and the Thai tea is soo good too. I recommend this place for lunch very affordable.",2
"Hands down the best Thai food in phoenix. Hubby says it's the best Thai food he's had since coming back from Thailand. Amazing service, quality food, and good prices. We go here a MINIMUM of once a month, usually twice and we only go out to eat on saturdays. nThe Pad Thai is to die for, and their fried bananas and coconut icecream is amazing.",2
"I love Roberto's but this one had a stale, unwelcoming and not too mention my bean and cheese burrito took a long time. I ain't picky but when you see a dirty dining area, filthy is more accurate, and your food takes a long time and there is unease in the place someone is responsible for sharing. That's me. Sorry Roberto's, I am not abandoning you but this was disappointing.",1
"Lobby had a strange smell. Service was good and quick. Friendly waiters. nFood was good as always but the experience was ruined when someone comes in with a German Shepard. This was not a service or seeing eye dig so made it really bad so we left half way thru the meal. Big furry dog. May not ever go back. I like dogs, just not sitting at the table eating with me.",1
"The food is cheap and authentic Thai. Although somewhat cramped, the ambiance is much nicer than an average Thai restaurant, and the take out service is reliable. The staff is also very nice. If you like hot food, their scale is well calibrated 10 is very hot . If you do not like your food hot, play it safe and ask for something extremely mild.",2
"I love NoDa! The arts district is starting to come into it's own and in the heart of the arts district is Wine Up. When I'm in town, I go to listen to poetry and Jazz. There's plenty of seating and It's great for a girls night or a big group of friends. The talent that performs here is top notch too!",2
Best salon in Arizona. I've been going there three years and counting. They always have the best stylist hard at work specifically Stephanie and Samatha . These are some of the coolest people you'll meet. The owner Tad is the man and also a great stylist. Hair Pollution is by far one of the most unique and artistic establishments I've ever seen. Thumbs up from me! !,2
"This place has completely gone south. We've been eating here several times per month for 8 10 years and won't go again. The great service is gone, and the food is awful. This used to be our favorite restaurant, and we'd always ask family for gift certificates as a Christmas present. Shame this used to be a really great place to eat.",1
"It is a great bar, IF you are single and have low standards! Their brunette bartender, Priscilla, is the primary reason we longer go there. Between her crazy and rude antics and the bar fights amongst the meth heads we have decided that although the bar may be close to home, it's just not worth the drive!",1
"Food was good. Young girl at front wasnt very nice, when asked to sit at a table that had 4 seat she told us it was reserved and put us by the wall. The so called reserved tables were never used well we ate. Saw them turned away customers because all the 2 seat tables were taken. I wont be going back there. Thats what we get for trying a new place out.",1
"They may be the oldest sushi bar in town, but they are an American sushi bar. Expect the rice to be sweet, the krab mix to be sweet and the ginger to be laced with nutra sweet. Great if you want to take your new girl for her first California roll, but if you know Japaneese food, you will say ""pre pak "".",1
I LOVE Dutch Bros! Customer service is awesome! I always leave with a huge smile on my face. The baristas and barist bros are soo much fun and remember me and my order every time I stop in. The stamp cards are great too for free drinks and double stamp Tuesday's. Every other coffee shop leaves me disappointed now that I've experienced Dutch Bros! Love you guys!,2
"I have gone here a few times and its not luxurious, but its totally cool for the price. I don't want to pay 20 for a 12 minute tanning session and I don't want to sign up for anm auto debit membership. So to walk in somewhere with no strings attached, pay 5 and walk out with great color that's great for me ",2
I have been going to Sub Factory for years and years and its by far the best sub shop in arizona. Terry the owner is the Best Business owner ever and the employees there are Great they get to know you and know what you order. They area all extremely nice. I recommend you try this location off broadway and hardy you will not be disappointed.,2
"Bah I arrive too early for the Happy Hour. The soup is so good. It melts away my cold. Yummy. Nothing best than a bowl of hot soup. Finally they have the coconut jelly available. The coconut milk top is a bit thick for me so my friend eat it all but he seems like it. I like the bottom. Cold, sweet, and soft. Never fail expectation in here.",2
We have been using them for about 4 years now. We only use Blaire. He's amazing. Does such a great job and really takes his time. None of this 5 minute spraying and done. Highly recommend him! I am wickedly afraid of any creepy crawlers and he always makes sure the problem is taken care of. Blaire is the best.,2
"This store has some of the worst service imaginable. Just try to purchase a phone from their mobile Center, seriously just try it. All the employees act like it's an inconvenience to them for you to be there. Most of them are terribly uninformed about the products that they are trying to sell you. I suggest if you're looking to purchase something do research online before you buy it from them.",1
"Their fish tacos tasted a little too fishy some parts tasted like the grill or just burnt. I give the tacos a 2 5. My boyfriend had a burger, don't recall which burger, but he said it wasn't very good. We ordered onion rings it was a huge portion, but like everything else, it was mediocre. Maybe I'll give them another chance, but probably not any time soon. But all the workers were very nice!",1
Terrible . We made a reservation and showed up on time. The hostess told us it would be a few minutes. She continued to do so for the next hour. The attitude they had was that is just the way it goes. I suppose they have enough business they don't care about customer service. For the kind money you are spending there are too many good restaurants in Vegas to go here,1
Stay away from random people asking you to hug and smell them. You will regret it. Very weird layout. You have to walk past a bunch of random street vendors and a very loud outdoor bar to get in here. I'm not a huge fan of this place. I imagine the rates are pretty decent for that very reason. The piano bar sounded kinda cool though.,1
"I LOVE THIS PLACE! i just got back home but i had an awesome experience here at the RIO hotel and casino. The IBAR was a bit expensive but me and my friends just drank in the room prior to coming down to the bar so that saved us some money, but as far as atmosphere, it was great! very fun place and their mixed drinks are sooooo delish!",2
"Great Dive Bar, interesting mix of people. Plenty of Beers on tap to choose from, bartenders were really nice, and the smoking in the bar makes me miss the old days of coming home smelling like smoke. We walked here from our Hotel so we didn't have many options, after an hour it could get boring though.",2
"This is one of the best burgers I have ever had ""very tasty "". Fries were awesome and it even comes with dipping sauce. Also one of the best things on the menu is the Adult root beer float it, what makes it a adult drink is the little bit of Vanilla vodka it comes with. They also have Adult milk shakes that sound great.",2
"this is the worst casino i have ever been to ieveda, i was there on 6 4 1 30 pm playing craps after losing more than 65,000 i was very upset so i went to the bar to get intoxicated and ended up being kicked out, the security guards rushed me like abunch of ninjas and were very rude. they wouldnt even let me finish my beer",1
"I was in the store for over 20 min with my 3 year old and asked if my small box of toys was ready. An employee asked the owner Lisa who was chatting with friends about her vacation plans to please finish my box, she threw everything back in my box but one item and never made eye contact while handing me my money. So rude, will never go back!",1
"I actually like this place a lot. The portions were generous and the food kept well in a to go container. My girl had a Groupon, so we saved a lot by using that. My gorgonzola and steak pizza was very good and even though I have a hearty appetite, I was only able to eat three slices before throwing in the towel and asking for a box to go.",2
LOVE this place. Staff if always very pleasant. Every time I go it's a positive experience. The breakfast was great. It tastes like mom's home cooking. The burgers a great. It was 4 and some change for a cheese burger and fries. CHEAP for good a quality meal. I look forward to trying new things on the menu.,2
"I would highly warn against renting any of this company's units. After 5 years of renting with them, the service went from bad to worse. The rentals are affordable but their service is ridiculous. From no air conditioning for days on end, to roof leaks in a childs room that went ignored in monsoon season. I would not wish them on anyone. Renters beware.",1
"One of the best cheese steaks in the valley! Can't wait to go back. We tried to but they were closed for the day Their hours vary quite a bit by the day of the week they cater mostly to the weekday lunch crowd so if you are going on the weekend then check the hours. Some of their other offerings look good too, but I'm not sure I'd try them.I'm just there for the cheese steak and that is all.yum!",2
"We had been in Morocco earlier in the year. My wife's birthday was a reason to celebrate and to relive part of the trip.the food here was better than in Casablanca. Just surrender to the menu, ask for guidance and you will have a wonderful dining experience.The low ambiance is off set by great food and hospitality. We will be back often.",2
"I've been informed by a fellow Yelper that they are just closed for the season, I hope they're right! I find it strange they don't keep their phone number in service with a recording and that they didn't cover the course up to protect it from weather, vandalism, etc. Either way, I can't wait to get my game on in the spring!",2
"In my opinion a terrible restaurant. One of the worst tasting steaks i have tasted, over cooked, they could not even cook the bake potato correctly. Service was poor, and The manager acted like he could care less. No wonder very few people were eating there the night we dined there. They are much better restaurants in vegas to eat at",1
I've been here twice and the first time i came here i really didnt try the ox tail soup. but this time i shared the soup with a friend and i regret it cause i wish i would have gotten my own. the oxtail is so soft and the soup is so flavorful. i also ordered a loco moco. it wasent bad but ive had better. this place is the best place to go to after a long night out.,2
"I can't really judge the food all that much, but came here for a private event. There were food items like antipasta and flatbread pizzas. The food must have been out for awhile because it was cold. There is a nice bar set up so I could see this place as a great place to hang out and have dinner. The location itself is great for a private event. Parking is limited but there's street parking.",2
Typical high end Vegas shopping that is in every casino mall around the strip. The difference with this place is I felt the interior is pretty boring and un inspired. Compared to shops at places like Ceasers or the Venetian which actually took some time to plan and theme their setting making you want to spend more time. Crystals just looked like a fancy mall. Pass.,1
Nice folks. Retailers are always almost nice when you are buying something. I was returning a Mother's Day gift that wasn't loved as much as I would have liked and they were just as nice when I returned it as I when I bought it. Good selection. Seems like good value relative to other jewelers around. Will returext time I'm giving jewelry as a gift.,2
"Bring a blankey and chairs, a hat or parasol, water, and wipes. We had big fun! The car show was pretty huge. It's nice to see some new classics and rods. Plenty of choices. Too many to try. It would be awsome if they offered bites, like a slider, so you could try it all. Spent the rest of the day at The Coffee Cup. I absolutely adore BC, and I will be back, next year, for some more Dam BBQ.",2
"This place may well be the most underrated Chinese restaurant in town. Amazing food the management has recently changed, but the food is still top notch . Try the hot pot or the sauteed Chinese greens. The Dandaoodles are pretty great too. For Urbana dwellers, this is great and does not necessitate driving all the way to Golden Harbor. Go here and eat!",2
"Looking for quick and easy, tasty pho while in Vegas? This is def the closest spot to the strip for real pho! Had this on a Sunday afternoon and it hit the spot. I got the beef bowl and my lady friend got the chicken and we shares some fresh spring rolls. All of it helped the hangover and we left satisfied. If you need pho while in Vegas make this your choice!",2
"While I certainly appreciated the variety of ethnic food that World Harvest offers, I was very disturbed to find two small dead worms on a box of Spanish rice I was about to buy at first I thought it was two grains of rice which made me even more disturbed . That is just not acceptable for a grocery store. If you are going there, be sure to look over all of your items before purchasing.",1
"I like to venture out w diff. types of food once in awhile so I wanted to give this place a try with a Groupon offer. Total disappointment. First of all, its location.sucks! Secondly, unprofessional staffs busy eating and talking.sucks! And lastly, very dried up NO flavor over fried food.major sucks!",1
"As someone new to the craft beer scene, I'd have to say this was a win. A simple yet distinctive watering hole. You'll have to look for it as it hides off of the main road with a gravel parking lot just beyond some abandoned railroad tracks. Don't expect a menu and munchables but there are peanuts aplenty. It's strictly beer, but that's what you came for, right? Jalapeno Pale Ale is a must have!",2
"Really quality vintage clothing. I have so much of my wardrobe from this boutique. Great styles, good prices and you cant leave this place without wanting to buy a trunk filled with goods. Honestly, one of the top 3 vintage shops in town. Service is awesome, per usual. Traci and Jasmine are always willing to offer any help and throw the best community events for their shop. A ",2
"If you are looking for the best coffee and pastries in Phx look no further. The honey latte here is by far my favorite as well as any cookie, or the salted caramel bar. The staff here really know their coffee, not to mention they are all really cool people as well. If you are in downtown make it a point to stop in !",2
"No. Ew. Wtc. Yeah sure it's a nice looking place, but take it from a Chinese girl who grew up in a Chinese dense area. Ya don't pay that much money for mediocre food. Nothing and I say nothing about that food was memorable. The only thing about this place that is memorable, the bill. nTell me we didn't pay that much for that meal. To this day, please tell me.",1
"HMMM NOT MUCH TO SAY HERE! The usual new ""hit "" club. This place was gorgeous, hence the two stars, the people were ugly though. The music was horrible something like a jumble of mike jones and chingy? yeah sounds about right. Next time I will save 100 bucks on drinks and sleezy guys and take it over to an after hours house club instead,",1
"Really liked this place when they were in Scottsdale and we would go in occasionally. Thought they sold and closed but realized one of the owners reopened in Tempe. Went in for eggs and bacon and berry waffles. Also, the mushroom omelet, mimosa, and Americano. Everything was good. I think it will get more refined as they work out the kinks. The staff is great and look forward to going back.",2
"Conflicted on my review because this restaurant is really good but it is shockingly expensive. Like a trip to Mastro's expensive and the food isn't on that level. They are also rocking a 3 to 4 times mark up on wine. The service and ambience are pretty great though, so check it out, but bring your high limit credit card for sure.",2
"We were very unimpressed with our visit. Customer service was far less than stellar, food was okay. Asked for a cone instead of sundae with 5 meal and was told no makes no sense! I've managed a DQ before and would not have had a problem making a switch to a cone in place of the more expensive sundae.",1
"These cupcakes were AWFUL! The sweet and salty was so salty all the way thru it was inedible, the frosting on the others cupcakes were like eating a mouthful of shortening so tasteless and thick and the cake in the cupcakes was a few step down from a box cake mix. Soooooo disappointing considering the high reviews others gave.",1
This buffet should be shut down. Its a shame that red rock has introduced no changes at all in its buffet items. Its gone from bad to worse. The staff looks overworked and underpaid. No one smiles. It is like a zoo. Food tastes awful. Cutting corners to control expenses is fine but with Red Rpck needs to revisit its buffet items and the staff helping in that section.,1
I have a love hate relationship with this place. I love that they have everything you could ever want for cooking or baking but hate that my wife wants to spend hours there asking my opinion on different types of rolling pins and cupcake decorations. This place really is a one stop shop for cooks and aspiring chefs. Robert Pfeifer,2
"Can I give these company a worse score? Less than 2 years later, the pump I purchased is broken. My regular pool guy who was out of town in August of 2011 when I wrote the 1st review took the pump apart and found out that it was never grounded. Buyer BEWARE! I am not the only person this happened to. No apologies. No warranty. Nothing.",1
"Great service, clean, dependable, and quick. I had a stripped screw in my air filter housing and I went here with a new filter in hand. Zimbrick Honda quickly removed the screw, installed my filter and had me out the door in 5 minutes with no charge. I'll be using them as my regular oil change location, rather than the quick lube joint that stripped my screw and didn't inform me.",2
"Horrible Customer Service, if you can call be ignored service. Also, not to customer service individuals, customers do not want to hear about the internal drama of your work situation. Especially when they are there to sign up for a bridal registry, which would bring a lot of money to your store. Just sayin'",1
I stopped at this location because of a driver's side wiper blade that was not making contact in my line of sight across the windshield had on for less than one month . Joe exceeded my expectations when he took a look at the wiper blade and tested different brands to help fix the issue. I will definitely return to this location for the friendly service and attention to customer needs.,2
"Only gave 2 stars, because when I mentioned Military discount the lady behind the register looked at me like I was crazy, she said ""no discounts here, we don't even get employee discounts "" REALLY, ! Employee discounts !. I did more for this country in Iraq, than that lady will do her life at the restaurant, Your welcome lady ! I think she could of been a little more appreciative.",1
"Mod is reinventing the concept of co working space in Phoenix. Mod features work space with an open atmosphere while providing secluded meeting space wheeeded. Mod is also home to gourmet coffee, exquisite food and an impeccable location. Whether it's just for a day or for a long term space, mod provides the perfect option for those looking for a great co working space in Phoenix.",2
"Never been before. We were in Phoenix for a concert across the street. I ordered the Danny Boy's Sheppard's Pie. Boring. One note flavor, and just covered up by boxed potatoes. It's served with ""toasted "" bread. Mine burnt. I also ordered a Ceaser's salad. Poor thing. drowned twice in dressing. My water was good, though. And our waitress at least made eye contact with me, and not just the boys.",1
"Wow. This place could be great if they did not charge 2 3 times what a head shop NOT on Mill Ave charges. I know their rent may be high, but their prices are like STUPID. A little tie die baby onsie was 35! RIP OFF! Smoking materials pipes, bongs are just STUPID. GO to Trails instead, for the love of God. Biggest rip off head shop in Arizona.",1
"many are saying its better than 'shaved ice' but why? cus the ice is soooo finely shaved that its texture is just like ice cream. and most importantly, the flavor lasts til the last scoop. unlike 'shaved ice' where you're just eating ice and sipping the flavor out. plus they use all organic ingridients.",2
"Nothing special. Chicken is OK, prices are in the midrange. Service is slow, so if you're in a rush for lunch let them know. We came as a big group for a birthday lunch and we were in and out in 2 hours which is unacceptable. It wasn't even busy either. nThe roast beef sandwich au jus was delicious however. Crispy fried onions and melted cheese over beef will win me over every time.",1
"Had a Panda bowl with chow mein and broccoli beef, pretty standard for Panda Express. Only problem I had was with the broccoli not being cooked enough it looked and tasted like they threw it in last minute. Overall restaurant was clean, fast, with very friendly staff and good portions he could barely put the lid on. ",2
"Worst doctor ever. Poor customer service and lack of communication. I scheduled my appointment for 730. Woman upfront entered it as 7 I scheduled it 2 hours before I started work at 930 when asked why I didn't receive a confirmation call or call when I was ""late "" she said we don't offer those because they upset our clients. Do not recommend and will never go back.",1
"I'm doing two because the guy I talked to was nice and the driver as well. However this pizza. Not to great. It arrived lukewarm at best. I live less the a mile away. I asked for the meat to be separate ordered a half and half , first bite, got a bite of meat. fed it to my dogs. They didn't like it. Soooo I donno.",1
 Made a reservation for Valentine's day based on positive reviews n Food was fresh and authentic n Service made the experience unbearable. We waited 30 minutes between each course and the bill. The total dining experience was 2 30hrs. n We were beginning to fall asleep at the table with the amount of time it was taking OVERALL Food was good but didn't justify the wait. Won't be going back. Sorry!,1
A repeat customer. Imperial Peking duck was awesome. Shrimp in black bean sauce was very tasty. Kung Pao chickeicely spiced. The duck is carved table side just like Wing Lei but for less than half the price. Service is excellent . Chow mein just like the food in Hong Kong. The food is as good as any Chinese food on the strip.,2
"Artie provided fantastic service! I called him to replace my broken and clogged garbage disposal and he did a fantastic job. He was prompt, professional, efficient, and reasonably priced. He made sure the repairs were finished completely, and got the job done quickly. I also enjoyed chatting with him. I highly recommend Arties Master Plumbing!",2
Food is good if the little tiny short mexican american girl with the big nasty attitude and mouth didn't stomp around the place like she owned it and gonna tear it down slamming drive through windows on paying customers rolling her eyes every question you ask her ect she's just sick and rude and has no place in a business that has customers!,1
"Maybe even 5 stars. My lady and I met here on a our first date. The inside is set up nice with good ambiance. The outside seating area is crazy good. Lots of comfortable seats and is huge and has interesting decor. Wine is wine and as good as it comes. Food was Artichoke dip first time and second time was a Proschiutto, Fig and blue cheese appetizer. Yeah.way good!",2
"I used to love Flo's. We would go there once or twice a month. Have moved out of the area, haven't been there in a year or so. Went there for dinner on Friday night. Food tasted great. All three of us had food poisoning all weekend long. Needless to say, we won't coming back for a long time if ever.",1
"I find myself gravitating towards the pork reigns specialty pizza. Sometimes dough can be undone but nothing a little oven time can't fix at home. The owner manager is awesome, he REALLY cares about his customers and product he's putting out. The garlic knots I do find myself unable to share with anyone else but myself. Plan on going back as long as I live in the area.",2
"Place is friendly, menu on wall a little hard to navigate through but nothing to worry about. Service is very fast and coffee tasty. Once I tried my food I was very pleased. I had the Apple smoked chicken sausage scramble and it was really good. One thing I'd like to point is the table, it was a bit dirty. But good over all. Will definitely return since we don't have places like this in Maricopa.",2
The salsa and the fact it's a neat old building on the outside is the only reason it gets 2 stars. Tamales' were drenched in a red sauce and tortilla soup was luke warm and mediocre at best. Chips were cold and hard not warm and crispy. Overpriced for the quality of meal. Real disappointment when there's better Mexican food in Indianapolis!,1
"This place was recommend to us by a friend and we stopped by on our last day of vacation. The food is amazing. Not your typical bar food at all. We had a few of the 50cent deviled eggs, short rib flatbread, and a portobello mushroom burger. All excellent. We talked to the chef who said they make everything from scratch.",2
"Before REI had even considered opening in Phoenix, there was Arizona Hiking Shack. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. They are very good at fitting their customers with the right gear. They make every effort to be sure that you have what you need and are prepared for your hike, climb or backpacking event. They are also a great resource for local maps and information.",2
"I'm sorry but the food was not at all what I expected. Service was terrible and management made not attempt to address the disappointment after trying to make our steaks correct. Apparently the chief does not know what is ""Medium Well ""? nIt was either Well or Raw. How can a business exist? Never again.",1
"After taking Greyhound from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, I decided to use a different service to return and I AM SO GLAD THAT I DID. Boarding was organized and almost as smooth as it could get! The bus was clean and moderately comfortable, it was basically just a good trip back home. This is now the travel bus for me until it becomes like what Greyhound is now, if ever.",2
"Do not go here. First off, I asked them for a exterior detail. They charged me 150 dollars for an ""oversize SUV "" when in fact I had a little Land Rover, and I asked them not to do the hood as it had been recently painted. They did the hood anyway, and made me wait 4 hours for a job they said they could do in 90 120 minutes.",1
"This location scares the bejesus out of me. There's always armed policeman patrolling the store, the lights are dim, and for some reasons it always smells when I walk in. The clientele don't help either, but that has nothing to do with the store.just its proximity to a particularly poor part of town.",1
"Ultimate fail for not having Jurassic Park The Lost World functional! My friends and I needed our dinosaur fix, but you deprived us of it! At least DDR was more enjoyable, especially after seeing a random drunk person challenge one of my friends to a round of DDR. The next time I come here, Jurassic Park better be operational or else I will not be pleased ",1
"LOVE Dr. Luba here! I followed him from another practice. Talk about a doctor that is on his game and cares for his patients. Thank you! The online patient portal is great as well for questions for the doctor, prescription refills, etc. Way to go with the technology! It really enhances the patient care.",2
"This place charges 8.00 FOR WATER. They refused to give me tap water AND they gave me a small Fiji water for 8 bucks. I thought water was my right as a human being? The only reason they get a second star is because Andrew Keegan was at the club the night I went. Not that I am a huge fan girl or anything, it just reminded me how awesome the 90's were.",1
"Solid taco shop, tried it after driving by for a long time. We will be back again. I grew up in Southern CA, I know my way around Mexican food Burritos, Chicken and rice, fish, carnitas and carne asada all good. Decent Salsa bar three flavors, marinated carrots and cucumbers. El Regio is a solid choice in NW Las Vegas, Ann 95 north, Give them a shot.",2
"Surprising good time here, cheap bottle service, cool security, chill crowd! Was dark, red, gothic bordello themed, it would make a great afterhours spot! The DJ last Saturday was killing it with old school hip hop, top 40, and mainstream house blended in just right so our group never sat down! I'm honestly trying to figure out who he was",2
"Anthony's Pizza is New York style and delicious. I am also a big fan of their chicken parm sub, modified with some wing sauce I wrote this review because I wanted to share a story about their customer service. They delivered the wrong order to me today, and before I could call them to complain, they delivered my correct order. Well played Anthony's!",2
"The pizza here is not too bad, a little above average, good toppings but the crust is probably frozen and not fresh. Their nacho stix are expensive pieces of dry cardboard with cheese and jalapenos, nasty. Don't bother with those. n The lower rating is due to the fact that we had to wait over an hour for a pickup order. This is the second time we have been delayed and is not acceptable.",1
"I agree with Nicole's comments. Stopped in today 10 10 and tried two different flavors carrot and lemon. Both were dry I've had better tasting ones from a box mix and the icing was overwhelming in quantity, underwhelming in taste. If you're only going to offer one commodity, you need to make sure it's outstanding, and unfortunately, these cupcakes weren't even close.",1
"I knew it would be flavorless and overpriced and it was, The Pho was devoid of anything called flavor, service was meh but we were captive in the Hotel and there was no line. Drag yourself off the strip and head up Spring Mountain road if you want real Chinese food, this is a complete waste of money",1
"They deserve a zero star! hate this stupid airline and their bs. No wonder their flight attendants are such b! u00b1 u20ac u00a3 ! they announce delays when you should be taking off and the excuse the idiot at the counter gives you is diff then what the idiot on the intercom says. If ure tryin to save money, DONT! pay the extra few bucks for a real airline",1
"Came here on 12 29 14 and I ordered pepperoni pizza and my mother ordered Spaghetti, both cam with salads. When I got my pizza it was extremely grease and limp, nothing at all like New York pizza should be, and my moms spaghetti sauce was 95 water, when you moved the pasta it was just water and grease and her meatballs were all burnt. Overall very disappointed with my experience here ",1
"Just ate there today and I think their sausage gave me some food borne illness. I say this because the group we ate with didn't seem to be affected except those who ate more of the sausages. Usually me and my fiance have iron stomaches, but this is not the case. It's ruining my Vegas trip. Me angry. So is my stomach. Never visiting any of their establishments again.",1
Pretty good overall. The chicken skewer was tender and juicy. The kefta pita was quite large good flavor and the meat was flavorful and easy to eat.but it was pretty oily. My pita was leaking juice and oil. I didn't care for the falafel at all I love falafel btw . The hummus was decent but almost runny. and the homemade hot sauce hade a nice kick to it but had a strong vinegar like taste.,2
If you are actually hungry skip this place and head over to Hubert's Burger Bar restaurant instead. The food was tasty but bite sized and the price is very high for what you are getting.throw in the fact they charge you for refills on soda and bread and I will say.pass. Too many choices of great restaurants to settle for this. OVERRATED.,1
First to Review? I have no idea how. Everytime I have been to this place there is a 30 minute wait one hell of a line. It's inside a gas station and they have great 5 lunch specials. All their sides are really good. The sauce is sweet and the ribs are nicely smoked and meaty. They participated in the 1st annual BBQ Battle and gave out full meal portions. Good stuff.,2
"I checked out this place with an Eversave deal. I ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch special. It tasted alright, but I left hungry and ended up getting a salad at McDonald's after I left. There was maybe 3 oz. of chicken on the plate, but I really think it was closer to 2 oz. The rice serving was about 1 2 cup. For around 8 I expected more. I'm glad I didn't pay full price.",1
"VWFW is the best! I usually see Jen Murphy or Venessa Thompson. They are both amazing! They never rush and always listen to any concerns I have. Dr. Pritchard delivered my son on October and she was very nice, she stayed in the room with me the whole time and made me feel very important, and not just the next lady having a baby.",2
"This used to be my favorite steak house in Charlotte. It's really gone downhill lately. The last 2 times I've eaten here the prime rib was still cold. I told the waiter to take it back and cook it some more. He brought it back STILL COLD. I realize prime rib is best rare, but this guy just didn't get it. Nice waitresses and free peanuts though.",1
"We went to this place as usual and were surprised to see a ""shrunken "" happy hour menu. We ordered calamari and lobster tacos and were unhappy with these orders. They had no taste and were overlooked. It seems to us the quality of this place is going down! Sad for that given the fact we are regulars!",1
Terrible service and the food wasn't anything special. Our waiter was working as hard as he could but the other 5 people working seemed to just be sitting around. We were 1 of 4 tables and I heard 2 other tables ask for the manager to complain. Bottom line is that this place offers nothing special and you shouldn't waste your time.,1
"Horrible food. I usually love Outback, but this location is horrible. I ordered the steak and lobster. Lobster was way over cooked and my steak tasted like a cheap Walmart steak. It was hard to swallow, that's how bad it tasted. Then our waitress broke my debit card while away and didn't even mention it. I found out when she returned my card and walked away.",1
This place has the worst service. I'm watching girls beg for the bartenders attention. We have been here 30 minutes with no drinks. The waitress refuses to even acknowledge we are sitting in her section. The manager needs to make some changes. A lot people at the bar and tables with no drinks! Horrible service.,1
Edinburgh needs more genuinely local eateries. Bijou is a small but friendly cafe off Leith Links. Been around for a few years now and has continued to evolve through a change in management. Good quality basic menu most dishes in 3 sizes with some good specials. I like the friendly feel that welcomes you for a coffee or for food. Kids welcome too.,2
Very sub par. Took an hour and ten minutes between the first ordered appetizers to the main course. The crab legs were insanely over cooked and discolored. And the porter had a weird metallic flavor to the meat either from the cast iron pan or just from searing the bone for too long. Not a happy camper.,1
"Only 4 stars because they are a bit pricey. But other than that.let me tell you about the extreme measures I would go for just a drop of the lemon rice soup. It has such a fabulous taste! Get extra pita bread with it and make it a meal. Dip it until the last bit is gone. The hummus is pretty good, too.",2
The Superstition Mountains are the perfect embodiment of the Arizona desert beauty that I imagined as a kid growing up in Utah. This park allows you to nestle up to this unique landscape. One of the better places to mountain bike in the area. Ride the place at sunset and you will be amazed at what mother nature can do.,2
"Last time we eat at the Kopper Keg. This is the second time we had bad experiences with their steaks for breakfast. Extremely tough with gross veins throughout. Complained to our server only to have her say ""I'm sorry "". No refund was offered or discount off the bill. Sorry you had a bad dinning experience, but pay the bill and be on your way.",1
"This location is terrible. Poor management, slow service and young kids working that don't have a clue about customer service. Whoever hired the people here is to blame. Never coming back. Also, when your buying overpriced bagels, you shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes in line when there is nobody in the drivethru.",1
"i would give 10 stars!, SO delicious!, i brought my uncles, they were in town, from Florida, they were expecting me to take them to a nice place, to have a good lunch and i always heard about this restaurant but i never tried it before, it was my best first time trying it, beautiful place, a lot of parking, delicious food, beautiful waitresses!",2
"I've been going to King's for quite a few years now both take out and sit down. Have to say that my favorite dish is the Pineapple Shrimp, second being the cinnamon sugar donut thingies uber good, but oh so bad for you! Food is always hot. And they are always on top of their game with drink refills removal of finished plates.",2
"A very nice Casino as your entering Nevada from Arizona, they have a great selection of slot games and table games We didnt go to any of their restaurant options here, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. nIts a nice place to stretch out your legs if your coming from Phoenix, and has some great scenery here!",2
"Witnessed manager refuse to take back an order that was messed up. Was an absolute jerk to a very nice lady who just wanted to exchange it for what she ordered. Caot believe a manager could be so unprofessional! Corporate, if you see this, have a talk with the manager on duty on 6 30 11 6pm. I can say that his attitude turned many people away that were in line. Not good for your business!",1
"Durants I an excellent steak house! It will take you back in time, as the decor is, what do I want to say, outdated, still well kept. You have to walk into the kitchen to get to the restaurant, what an experience, everyone greets you! My husband I have been there several times, please try this restaurant, you want be dissapointed.",2
"Excellent, genuine Italian restaurant. I love the intimate atmosphere. The fresh bread always comes directly out of the oven to your table. The prices are extremely reasonable for nicely sized portions. It also means a lot to me when the owner takes the time to talk to his customers. On our last visit he asked where we were from, if we were satisfied, etc. I will absolutely be back.",2
"This is a great little market! I love the fresh sandwiches salads fruits available and Seattle Best coffee selections. nI expected a snooty cashier, expensive strip prices and very little to choose from.but NO! nWith free wifi, reasonable prices med coffee 1.79! , low key but friendly service and amazingly convenient location, you really can't beat it! Yay Resnicks!",2
I have only been to this restaurant twice and I have to say that I am a fan. This place makes Subway look really bad! Not only is the staff here very friendly and good at their jobs but the food there is just delicious. I Love the fact that everything is cut fresh before your eyes instead of wondering how long its been sitting in this nasty tub out in the room temperature air. A big thumbs up.,2
"Wow. You would think that this place would have a warning sign saying ""Everything here is great.except the buffet "". This place was remniscent of an old folks home in the midwest. Bland, boring, really not good food. I felt like I was on an all you can eat crap fest. Trying to choose the least bad thing there. Looking back, I should have asked for my money back.",1
"What really has not been already said about the Wynn? My wife and I stayed for a night on the way to the Grand Canyon. We found a ridiculous deal on Hotwire for about 120 for the night for a room with a view of the mountains to the West. That deal combined with the quality of the sheets, gigantic flat screen, marble in the bathroom helps me justify giving the Wynn a top rating.",2
"Located in The Fremont Hotel Casino on Fremont Street in Downtown Las Vegas. I went for breakfast. I hate to give a bad review. One word Yikes! The selection was scant. I had a danish, I am not saying it was stale, but I wanted dessert not a weapon. There is better and cheaper in Las Vegas. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",1
I don't think I'd ever come here again. I mean it's in a convenient location and it's great that they have pizza by the slice but it just isn't great. I rather have slices then this place. I tried the pepperoni pizza and it was decent.I also tried this chicken bacon ranch and it was not the business.but thats what I get for experimenting lol,1
Came here during EDC and Pacquaio weekend! It was a bachelorette Birthday weekend. . . nWe lucked out b c my friend's husband took care of the hotel for us 5 girls to stay for the weekend. nThis place is exactly how the venetian is layout wise nRoom service was amazing! Food is fantastic! nAnother awesome experience in Vegas!,2
"Went here for lunch. Really slow service. People who sat down after us got served as well as got their food before us. My burger wasn't cooked well and tasted awful. When I told them it didn't taste great, they didn't take it back and didn't offer to remove it from the bill. Fries were cold as well. Overpaid for a lunch that made me sick. Won't be going back",1
"The Hibachi grill was okay, very bland seemed more like a Mongolian grill even the Fiesta has better a Mongolian grill than this place and only 7! The food was okay mostly bland, the dessert selections were okay, not fresh seemed like it came from the freezer. at 15 dollars a person I will not be returning, definitely overpriced for the quality of the food.",1
I used to love this place but what classic deli serves a sandwich with no pickle on the side. Cheap skates do this bottom line is this after ten years of going to Jason Deli I'm not doing business with them service 0 food Quality 0 my rye bread was hard Pastrami was dry f this place. This place has gone down hill Marz out.,1
"I'm not big on BBQ but my boyfriend is and we both loved this place! Our server, Drew, was awesome. He was incredibly helpful and friendly. Agree with all of the other post that recommend the bacon wrapped jalape u00f1os and also the brisket and ribs. All of the meat we had was cooked perfectly and delicious. Highly suggest trying this place! Will definitely be back!",2
"Oh Phoenix you did it again. How can you screw up breakfast? Cold eggs congealing on a plate? Yes! Raw, yet greasy potatoes that taste like chorizo? Yes! Cold limp bacon? Yes! Possibly the worst breakfast I have ever had in my life. If you want a bad breakfast, I would recommend 5 and diner, for a truly horrific experience I would go Joe's Diner all the way.",1
"Went there with the Wife. Lots of stuff for the ladies. I would lay off making any real purchase here on my own, I would of course consult the Mrs. In regards to what she might like. Way to tough to try and pick something out in here Louis Vuitton, Gucci, etc. that is the stuff for the ladies to decide on. Nice place, very friendly staff, warm, and inviting one to buy.",2
"You know, at first I was a little skeptical to go to another burger joint. But after we got in there, our waitress I forgot your name, sorry blonde lady! was very good and she was awesome at what she did! I recommend this place, the food was very good if you like burgers, will be coming back for sure.",2
"Was looking forward to checking out the ""new "" half shell, now called beach house. nNothing different from it either. Service was slow, and my order was messed up. It took an hour to get food and I also had to go to the bar to get my own drink because our server was no where to be seen. Slow everything, horrible service",1
"I Specifically asked for NO MEAT of any kind. Even made inquires about the sauces and if they had chicken broth, etc. When I got home we found our rice had little bits of beef in it. My girlfriend is a vegetarian so one can imagine this ruined her dinner. Also the prices online were cheaper than what they charged in the store, not cool. Certainly will not return to Quick Wok.",1
We were hungry while waiting for our flight so we decided to give Pwi Wei a try. We ordered the Mandarin Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Steak. The food is extremely salty and greasy. The only good thing about this place is it's made to order so you know the food the food hasn't been sitting there for hours.,1
Excellent place for lunch with a little bit of everything. My favorite happens to be the double potato spring rolls so tasty. But you want some kind of Asian or even Italian they have it. Service could be a bit better happens to be slow but for what they offer it is pretty good especially late night.,2
"I have been searching for a good Cheesesteak, and I have found it. These guys are living my dream. The owner and his wife started with a food truck and are now running a nice little spot. They do so with a smile and friendly Hello when you come through the door. Really glad they are close to the house and work. P.S. Park in back",2
Horrible experience at store across from Gate E9 at airport n5 employees and I couldn't pay for my purchase nTwo on cell phones nOne manager ringing up other employees cigarettes Two standing around watching who knows what. nWhen I left the manager came out only to lie to me saying he couldn't ring me up because register wasn't working.oh except if you were buying cigarettes nWhat a joke!,1
Worst printing service I ever had. The employee raped my friend's bank accounts by misquoting them and giving them zero options. We are design students at asu and were very dissatisfied with the overall experience that was offered. I will never bring my business to this location or any other fedex office or junkie locations again.,1
"The best burger in the Burgh, some say. I ordered the ""Fancy Burger "" Pittsburgh rare and it was superbly prepared. I'm not one to lightly order a rare burger but the quality of the beef at Butterjoint is second to none in the city. Cave aged Gruyere, onion jam, and an awesome bun all helped, but the beef was never secondary. Tessaro's is a better bet if you have a large party looking for burgers.",2
"Been using this cab company so many years, the service is just getting worst! Booked a cab last night for tomorrow pickup, called back the next day they dont have my reservation.make sure that you call the next day again just to check. Anyway, have to find another cab company.it's scarrrrryyyy, although have not missed a flight but too close to missed!",1
"Real bagels. Not rolls shaped like bagels you usually get in Arizona. I grew up in Detroit. I missed bagels from back East . . . Until the arrival of The Bagel Man. The owner has an original shop back in Jersey. That should say it all about authenticity. If you want a real bagel, check this place out. Never understood why people from the East love bagels? One visit here will explain it.",2
"Une farce. Hamburger correct sans plus , une frite correct , une bi u00e8re import u00e9e que l'on retrouve dans toutes les u00e9picerie! pour 35 . Service u00e0 18 car nous u00e9tions plus de 8. Non mais vraiment, je suis rest u00e9 u00e0 table par respect du groupe avec qui j' u00e9tais sinon je serais repartie aussit u00f4t vu l'arnaque du menu. Passer votre chemin.",1
Food was only ok but the real problem was the service. Our waitress was obviously not into waitressing on this particular day. It took about 2 hours to get a burger and a beer the special . The actual beer took a good 45 minutes to make it to the table. What?!? I can see the bar from here and nothing is happening. Where is my bud light ?!?,1
"I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years, Mainly because it's connected to the Convention Center. The economy certainly has hit this old Hotel. It was minimally staffed and some of the restaurants were closed on certain days. Room Service was prompt albeit EXPENSIVE! 30 for a pot of coffee, a croissant and an order of bacon. I will stay at one of the Marriott properties from now on.",1
"Im staerting to write extremely brief reviews of all the places I have been on the road. this is my first review nwicked awesome deli store ngreat service nawesome sandwich, with great bread. I will be back. nI'm pretty picky on my italina sandwiches, and this one worked very well. if your looking for something authentic, go here.",2
"The farther you move away from Chinatown, it can become difficult to find good boba, but No. 1 Boba is definitely one of the few exceptions. The thai tea is good, and the passion fruit green tea is great although very sweet . For the same price or less than Starbucks, this place should definitely be a go to summer stop if you're in the southeastern part of town.",2
"Pretty freakin' good burgers and the beer selection is awesome! The setup, however, is not! Order at the counter than go get a table and wait for the food to come out. 1. by 1. by 1 more. and by the time the other person is done eating their food. maybe you'll have yours in front of you. Apparently this seems to be an issue with others and not sure it really makes good business sense.",2
"Had a table here, not as much dancing as other places, it's more of a lounge bar. Good mix of people and the service was good. The patio is awesome and has some great views. I like it if you're not looking for a club, something a little easier before a crazy night the next night or at the end of a long stay in this town.",2
"Blue Martini is a great place to take a date. They've got a really nice menu filled with great appetizers as well as cocktails and drinks. The music blasts too so if you bring a date, you can enjoy the sounds as well as a mini dance floor that resides in the back of the restaurant. Ambiance is pretty nice. It's a tad on the pricey side but you're in Vegas! I wouldn't expect anything less.",2
"Food is yummy! But, don't go here on an empty stomach because its Tapas very small servings. We were really hungry! Their happy hour is still expensive though, but their drinks are very tasty and strong Downside, its a little too expensive, the upside is that they do have pretty good food and drinks. It's only a few blocks from our condo, which is a plus ",2
"Owned by ex Montreal Canadien Sergio Momesso and his family. This place rocks! Awesome Italian Sausage Subs here Which is what they're really known for , always ask for it ""spicy "". I also enjoy a spicy cheeseburger here too. Very affordable with sports on the TV screens. Good spot on Saturday afternoons. Closed on Sundays! ",2
"Cheap, easy, and a classic. This course is not anything you would see in North Scottsdale, but it is a fun 9 hole course which you can walk it and be done within 90 minutes. They do have a few par 4's and a hole or two which you have water. This course has been around for years and it does have that classic vintage feel to it.",2
"Service was great. Atmosphere awesome food comes with hair. Ordered a po boy, thought it came without hair but unfortunatly it didn't. Smoke house burger bun is soggy and so is the fries. JC WTF! I'd rather grill at home. So sorry to give a sucky review. I was looking forward to giving a 5 star. Food is over priced and NOT WORTH IT UNLESS U WANNA LEAVE HUNGRY! I feel sorry for the severs.",1
"I can see that these reviews are filtered. I wrote a review before and do not see that it got posted here on Yelp. The bad ones seem to be filtered ""OUT! "" nI took a friend on a Groupon and we were not happy at all. The pizza was sparse, the price was astronomical, and the service was horrible. Let's see if this makes it onto the reviews ",1
"I have been to several nightclubs for the alternative lifestyle, but, this one is one of my top three choices. The drinks and wait staff are amazing. The entertainment is above average and the variety if music they play make this a desired stop for those looking for a place to hang out off the beaten path here in Vegas.",2
"Hate coming here they take forever to make your pizza regardless if it's eat here 2go and the customer service sucks the staff is rude, I've had problems with my pizza before and they always have a attitude correcting it and never offer anything for my problem. Even with the new games and upgraded system",1
I absolutely love their chips and salsa which they offer to you free. The customer service here is excellent and have always had prompt service and the meals have come to you fast. Beers and happy hour is an excellent time to go and just relax. The only thing I thought was annoying was the floor fans that are along the bar.,2
"So happy I finally came! This time, as I will b back, I had a Thai tea which was delicious with sweet and sour chicken that was better than most in the valley, loaded with veggies but a good sauce. There is so much that this place has to offer so I will def b back soon with new updates on the thai, sushi and vietnamese that this restaurant offers.",2
"Horrible! My family waited 20 minutes after being seated for service in the middle of a slow Thursday afternoon. The service was poor and we had to flag down a different waitress since our waiter disappeared for 15 minutes at a time. The food was overpriced, over spiced dog food. It was a waste of money and 90 minutes of our lives.",1
"We had an amazing experience at this quaint restaurant. It was a beautiful day to sit on their patio. We had great margaritas in mason jars and great wine too! The chips and dip were wonderful. The salsa is a bit spicy, but we loved it! Food was well above average for a Mexican joint. Atmosphere is the best part of the place. We would go back in a heartbeat!",2
"Had not been to the Chart House in years, food and service was 5 stars ! Went with a group of friends form our local leads group , in Chatsworth Ca, we started with apps. Shrimp kabobs, Mac Cheese, salad yummy ! Main course for me was Seared Ahi on mashed! Everything was done to the 10ens . I would go back, and I would tell a friend !",2
"Fantastic is the best description. Have been taking my Honda's there for years. The service is always great. I never get sold an ""extra "" bill of goods. They let me get the most out of my car repairs and don't replace things that still have useful life to the parts. While still making sure i won't be stuck on the side of the road! Love these guys!",2
"4 stars for the decor and service, 3 stars for the food. The restaurant is completely stunning, and I will definitely come back during the warmer months so I can grab a table outside by the waterfall. I ordered a few pieces of sashimi, nigiri, and the oxtail fried rice. Everything was solid, but nothing to go crazy about. It is pricey, but the experience was lovely.",2
"Yes it's the best in Phoenix and probably well beyond Arizona, too. The sausage ""Wise Guy "" pizza is a national treasure. We heard a rumor that they bring in the NY water. It starts with the home made materials and the chef does it right. Arrive by 4pm and you'll likely be in the first seating at 5. Hardest working pizza chef needs a statue built for him. Highly recommended.",2
"This review is based on the more expensive Kobe burger that is simply the best burger in Phoenix so far. The parking is easy, secured and with parking validation, and in close proximity with some great shopping. Although the atmosphere is not as good as The Grind, Indulge and Deluxe, respectively, the service is the nicest, on par with Indulge.",2
"Sucky bed, you can smell smoke through the vents and rooms are small. The casino is old and full of older crowd. only thing good about this place was the pool. Good for single guys and college students looking for deals. Also no shuttles to the strip, take the bus right in front of the hotel, cheaper then a taxi.",1
I was so disappointed. The meat was wonderful but the atmosphere and service were not up to the high price. The service was slow and all of the staff seem to be racing around.literally you are in the middle of a mad dash of the waiter. nAnd what is with the blaring music. Not the atmosphere I want to be in. Could not wait to leave,1
"You can't go wrong wherever you sit! It's not the cheapest tickets around, but it certainly is worth it. I've seen almost all of the Cirque du Soleil shows and La Reve is certainly up there with all of them. The visual is stunning and most of the time, I'm overwhelmed by where to look because there is so much going on! If you can fork out the or lucky enough to get tix for free, don't miss it!",2
Heard this was the best place downtown.ahhh NOT. Pool of blood in bath tub upon check in with pubic hair on wash cloth and sink. Wife threw up. Told staff and they said would you like another room like it was no big deal. Well pretty much sick by this point. Never again screw this place and to he'll with Vegas.,1
"I love this place. The steak is amazing. The escargots is amazing. The bacon wrapped scallops are amazing! lol. I'm always a happy camper when I eat here. The atmosphere is intimate, the service is great and while the prices are a bit high, the food is well worth it. If you have family friends coming in form out of town this is a place to take them. I also recommend this for birthday dinners.",2
I've visited this place several times in the last 5 years and I'm always impressed by the crowds it draws. Tables are cheaper at the casinos up there. Just don't go on a night that the main stage features Ranchero music. You'll have to wade through the cowboy hats and avoid being trampled by thousands of pairs of snakeskin boots.,2
I like Backyard Tacos! The food is yummy and a good price. I really love sitting outside under the cute lights. My one issue with this place is the set up of the salsa bar! There is constantly a group of people around it because it's just not set up for more than 1 person at a time. Other than that I think it's a fun and casual place to eat!,2
This is our favorite in Scottsdale. We loved here so much from our last trip. We came back! Their salad is exceptional with light dressing with lots of flavors. My husband and I were impressed from appetizer to dessert! nLove their ambience as it's casual yet comfortably classy. Price is just right for the portion and the quality of food. We will definitely go back before we head back to New York.,2
I really enjoyed working with Living Energy. Their professionalism and attention to detail during my event was beyond amazing! The team at Living Energy worked seamlessly together to make sure our event was awesome! I would highly recommend this team for any event. A huge thank you for a job well done!,2
"We went there for dinner, me and about 7 coworkers. I was in Vegas on business. I had ordered the salmon which when they brought to me had a putrid smell to it. I cannot believe they would bring me a fish apparently they had in the freezer too long! Take this for what it is worth, he apparently preys on people that visit the Ravella Hotel. Sad, they should shut this guy down!",1
"Wonderful ambiance and food. Our group had delicious smokey, spicey spare ribs as an appetizer and I had a lovely, chicken and vegetable dish. The service was a bit slow but the owner explained that they were short a server or two. I'm always impressed when an owner is in an establishment and sharing the load. If we ever return to Montreal, this will be on my list again.",2
Love the buffet. I'm a lover of their butter chicken. Took my coworkers here and they are from India. Their response was ok food reasonably priced. I go for the butter chicken. They could make the buffet filled with food because they seem to run out of food really quick here. Love their Indian market.,2
"Ok, by far the BEST yoga studio in Arizona! I am an avid cardio lover and was a spinning instructor so I know a good workout. Sumit's Yoga is a great complement to any type of cardio or also a great workout on its own. Sumit is great and really makes the studio. I will be doing yoga with Sumit for many, many years.",2
I placed an order with them for delivery and they couldn't find my place. Instead of calling me when they were near my building they drove back to the restaurant and called me. I waited 2 hours to get my food and then still had to pay for it. The food is good but I won't order from them again because of the terrible service.,1
"I have been four or five times and all I can say is that it is fair at best. The tacos and burritos are very bland. The owner makes no effort to learn who you are. This part of town is a very neighborhood friendly place and Picante just does not fit in. I was so excited to see this go in, however I will be driving right past it to Chipotle.",1
"After a frustrating experience at Lowe's, I drove over to Ace hoping for better service. I was in luck. The employees were very helpful, even for an unusual request like mine. I received personal service, and the cashier was very friendly and chatty. Ace earned my business, I absolutely recommend them over the Depot or Lowe's.",2
"I ordered a beef and cheese sandwich, which was forgettable. It was beefy, but flavorless. Considering that I have spent time in the East Coast, this io way resembles hot sandwiches out there. I also found it to be on the expensive side. Their sides look interesting, but will sample them only if I'm in the area, which is right off the Meadows Mall and the 95.",1
"I went to Vegas for my birthday and decided that a pearl ring would be a good gift for myself. Think again. I paid over 80 for a ring and the first time I wore it it broke. I almost lost the pearl, but I found it in my jacket pocket which means i didn't wack it on anything. I am very glad I didn't allow that pushy sales man talk me into anything more expensive or another ""free pearl "".",1
We've been coming here since it opened and was such a fan of the carne asada and breakfast burrito but this time our food was cold. They have a real hard time understanding our order over the phone unless you can speak Spanish. Once there they seemed to work on differing orders one at a time so they were so disorganized. We hope this is just an anomaly and am sad to rate them low this time around.,1
"You can feast at Wicked Spoon. It fits the Cosmopolitan tagline ""Just the right amount of wrong "". The brunch options and quality of food is sinfully wrong. Get eveaughtier with bottomless champagne for an additional 10. Even if you're on a budget its worth making an all you can eat brunch your main meal in vegas.",2
Still really good food. There seems to be more people now going here because the other station Oyster bar is closed for renovation. Still worth the wait. JJ the Master Chef worked his magic and made an exceptional Combo Pan Roast. As always ate it to the last drop. You know a place is good when most of the people you sit next to are locals.,2
"I had to call these guys for a quick service call. nUsed them to repair garage door for a rental property. They could have easily told me to replace the entire door, however, they said it could be simply repaired saving me a lot of money. They showed up to the property on time and made the repairs. Paid the exact amount quoted. Honest, professional, competitive price.highly recommended.",2
"The hubs and I visited for lunch over the weekend. We started with white queso and added ground beef. The chips seemed very fresh and like most queso, we made it disappear quickly. The salsa was excellent. We both ordered enchiladas. His were ""de Dennis "" and looked a lot better than my run of the mill cheese enchiladas. Service was prompt and friendly. We will definitely give it another go.",2
My family and I were here last Christmas and we were highly disappointed in our burgers. The only one in our group that liked the food was my mother.and she did NOT order a burger! She had wings! So that says a lot. lol The rest of us agreed that our burgers were bland and tasteless and just not good. I've had way better burgers at Five Guys or IN N' Out or Astro Burger. Very disappointed!,1
"Superb gelato some of the best I've ever had! The guy behind the counter is the owner, and he takes pride in his gelato. They only use real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, and nothing contains hydrogenated oil. I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut. it was sublime. Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had. When I need a mid day sugar rush. I'll be back!",2
"This place cost me 37.50 to eat, but I think it was totally worth the 20, 10, 7 dollar bills and 50 cent change! The dessert was great! It had a cheese section, a bread section, a salad section.along with your typical Asian cuisine section and your red meat american section! I would definitely keep coming back.whenever I go back to Vegas.",2
"Not a fan of this Von's location at all. If you want to go to a nice Von's on Durango, go to the one near Desert Inn and Durango. This location is a dump. I caever find what I am looking for here. The way it is laid out is confusing. It seems fairly small, too. I will say their gas prices are normally some of the cheapest in town. That's about the only positive thing I can say about it.",1
"The catfish nuggets were just ok. The fried shrimp was typical frozen grocery store shrimp. I was very unimpressed. I would like to go back to try the wings which are the main attraction here. Hopefully they will live up to my expectations. I also look forward to trying the kool aid. The prices were quite high for the quality, also. Will revise once I've tried the infamous wings.",1
"Pretty unique experience. Copious drinking, comfort food, and polka brings together a really odd combination of college kids, retirees, and yuppies. Yummy selection of German beers. Come with a group that knows how to play the boot passing game! It's really fun! They also have a giant stein that holds something like 3L of beer.",2
"I have NEVER thrown away a pizza. The amount of cheese and grease. And trust me I never complain about pizza. I eat frozen pizza and don't even complain about that. Damn! They need a new crust and less cheese. And it would be perfect. However, they have other things on the menu I'm going to try. Don't listen to me, you might like it. But me and 2 others did not like it one bit.",1
Came in here for some bachelorette supplies and boy did I score some fun stuff! The staff that works here is super friendly and helpful. Its always fun to visit this store. They have a great selection of gag gifts for the bride to be. They were a total hit! nCant wait for the next event that brings me into the store.,2
"Stopped in around 5pm for a cupcake on a Saturday. The cashier was not very friendly, and seemed annoyed to have to answer questions. The cupcake was not fresh, tasted like it was at least 3 days old. The gigantic mound of icing on top did not disguise that stale taste either. Won't be back and wouldn't recommend. Booooooo",1
"NEVER AGAIN! I can stand the poor service and had put up with it several times because the food was decent for local Chinese restaurant. But will not tolerate if I get food poisoned and be sick for 5 days! After research and doctors visits it turned out to be norovirus, or Norwalk Virus! Enough said! Eat at your own risk people!",1
"I been to a few different Cheesecake Factory and this ranks probably at the top. Not only did they seat up near the fish tank trust me.this helps when you have two kids , they cut the bread and banana in small pieces for my kids while we waited for the entrees. I had the chicken piccata which was awesome.highly recommended. We even got to watch the Caesars statue show while dining.",2
All I can say is that this is just a step up from The Plaza. Pretty run down and bugs in the lobby bathrooms. Housekeepng does a piss poor job cleaning. Stinks when they are done. Hairs on comforter. All n all pretty gross and wouldn't be broken hearted if it got raised for the builing of something new. Save your money and stay at Encore or the Wynn.,1
Terrible service. Even the management is rude. Told our grandmother and grandfather they weren't allowed to sit at a table because they weren't ordering food. That was the start of it. The bar is boring with nothing good about it the only reason we went was because of proximity to the hotel. How they stay in business no idea,1
Not many menu choices but we both ordered the chicken fried steak could have shared one plate. We both had half our plates left over. That would have beeice to know ahead of time. The bread they serve before dinner is ok it kept the kids occupied until the food came. The food we ordered was ok but I don't think we will be back. Slow waiter service as well.,1
"LOVE this place. Staff is friendly. Vets are great! Plus, very reasonable with their prices. You can tell they are here for the animals. That's a huge plus for me. I swear Dr. Cordray is the dog whisperer! Anyone who has complaints probably has a poopy attitude. Won't bring my animals anywhere else! Thank you for taking such good care of our fur baby.",2
Check around and google this place. You will see it is normal for him to quote one price then ask a lot more when it's time to pay. Then will hold your boat hostage. Don't walk. Run to a different place unless you have good lube. You will get screwed. His employee even apologies to me and said he does it to everyone. Wish I had done more research first.,1
Went last august for my bachelorette party it was terrible. A bunch of us ordered salmon tartar yet none of our plates had the same consistency. I was missing the crackers on mine for starters and the waiter was annoyed to have to go get them for me. The food was lacking any taste and the service was terrible. Def not going back to eat.,1
"5 stars for the fact that Phoenix even has a Chinese Cultural Center area. The only place I've been to in it is the grocery store but one day, I plan to check out the lil gardens and restaurants. Can't wait until they get more in there! Don't go expecting a big Chinatown like scene. The take out from inside the grocery store is pretty tasty, inexpensive and fast! See ya there!",2
"A great ambience and good food. A little pricy, but I hope this place is here to stay. It reminds me of the Lux, where it's multiple things in one. There is a bar inside and outside, dining area, and an area in the back called marketplace for juice and breakfast. The entire place is massive. I live close by, so I'll be back for sure.",2
"The service is not that great.our server was nice, but very pushy. She kept trying to give us things we didn't want nor ask for.asked for a water 3 times and didn't get it until almost done with my meal. nGoing to pay with their little new pay yourself device.took the card from my moms hand.omg people these days!",1
"The location is nice, with plenty of outdoor seating on the river. The food is not that great. They have an all you can eat crab leg dinner. My husband thought that the crab was bland and overcooked. I had a crab cake sandwich in which I could not really taste the crab. Prices Sandwiches 10, Entrees, 18, Crab legs, 25.",1
Why is the the Heard museum putting up that tacky 8ft black aluminum fence around the museum? They are going to ruin the great historic charm of the museum. It is going to look like a prison in the middle of our nice historic neighborhoods. Please call Letitia Chambers President and CEO of the Heard Museum at 602 251 0227 to voice your opposition to the fence.,1
"Still great after all these years! Now even better that they are open 24 7. Menu has not changed a lot, but there was no need. The Pan Roast is still my favorite, but you can't find fresher oyster in the desert than here! The cook and the waitress are always friendly, so tip them well, they work non stop!",2
"absolute incompetance with registration and billing, someone was in training when I registered, now I am being billed for a room, that they already billed Am Ex. what a mess, spoke with staff and manager , one week later ,nothing is being fixed, in fact I owe them for one night. EEKKKKKKSSS nkeep away. .or double and triple check your bill. nHyatt Card member and gold member, nothing is helping.",1
"Pizza Amier is a really great little pizza joint, it's sort of a hole in the wall but great for takeout and delivery. Their gourmet pies are interesting and creative. I'm a big fan of the Labenese pizza. Battered and deep fried eggplant on a pizza? Sign me up! nThe tuna hoagies are really good, and my vegetarian friend said they really enjoyed their veggie hoagie.",2
"I love Nova's Bakery. My favorite things to get are the chocolate tuxedo cake and tiramisu. For about 3.00 a slice, it is worth every penny.so rich and just yummy. The staff is always friendly and the atomosphere makes me nostalgic and I begin to miss my college days of studying in cozy coffee houses.",2
"FUNGUS! MOLD! nExpired bottled drink. About to drink it. nMoisture and Mold on the inside of the cap! nStore manager, Peter Sung, too cheap to replace it with an in date larger bottle. nBottles were still on the floor as I left the store for anyone to buy. nDO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY HERE. FUNGUS! MOLD!",1
"The best thing of chada they are open late and the food is delicious. There's a lot of places that are open after 12am and are not good at all. There duck fried rice, crab noodles, spicy coconut shrimp. Pork belly. There whole fish. I try to try something new every time I go. I love the look of the dining room it reminds me of San Francisco little hidden gems.",2
I did not have a great experience here. I'm an avid spa goer and just felt the customer service was lacking and my massage therapist gave me a rub down instead of massaging and focusing on the areas I needed. I also thought they could have mats or something cause the floors are dangerously slippery.,1
"It's a chain restaurant, I guess so what can you expect? I was a tourist in town for MLB ""spring training "" and this place was right near the KC Royals' stadium. Had the chimichangas and maybe they'd spent too long in the warming area so they had gotten awfully chewy. I'd been hungry but it was too much trouble to eat these.",1
"I have in the past loved this place but WHAT SUP? nthe floor was dirty, the service slow and unattentive if the waitress had ever asked I would have told her the food was cold and tasteless and that was the 'special' ! ndespite this the place was packed so i guess they are resting on their laurels. too bad.",1
I don't go to Dish for the culinary experience. I do love the laid back vibe with some good southern hangover late night grub. I like to order a half grilled cheese sandwish with a cup of tomato bisque. I love that you get a deviled egg as a side to many dishes. Nice touch. My favorite is the black bean and rice burrito. Cool tunes in the juke box. Just a good local spot w o the frills.,2
I've really TRIED to like this place.simply for how cool it can be oh and that it's kid friendly and close to home if you've had a margarita! For whatever reason I've tried the same menu item 2x now and just did not enjoy it at all. Margaritas are good though! Nice bar and patio area.I guess if you're just looking to have a drink.good little spot. The END!,1
"Myself and my wife went in for ribs and a pulled pork sandwich to see what it was like ,but we were disapointed that the ribs we bought to eat in were not even cut . Well we were sitting the with styrofoam containers and plastic knives and forks not for me unless they chane to really plates and knives and forks we will not be back anytime soon",1
GARBAGE! Possibly the wost pizza in Charlotte and the fact that they're already revamping their menu does not bode well for the success of this place. Big names does not a restaurant make.Peter Reinhart needs to stick to writing about bread dough and keep his nose out of the Charlotte restaurant scene.,1
"If I could it would be 0 Stars. This place is the most horrific club ever in Vegas. Why is it in Vegas?! It's so unclean, ghetto, and a big no no! Checked this place out this past week for the first time just because I wanted to try a new club in Vegas. I think i'll just stick to Marquee, Hakkasan and all the clubs that are considered to be Vegas clubs!",1
First time here tonight. The service was great and a smile on there face! Very friendly staff. The prices are average and the inside is clean. The food was good. Everything tastes really good from the soup to the appetizers to the entr u00e9es. If we're in the again we will stop in for a bite to eat.,2
Being new in town this place was the jackpot. Tried them from flyer on door. Great menu selection. Delivery took a bit but in fairness it was Sat nite at dinner time. Food was well worth the wait. Walnut shrimp was best I've had. Good portion size and shrimp was cooked perfectly. Staff taking my order was friendly and professional. Delivery guy was great as well.,2
"Happened to walk by Uncorked last night, and decided to stop in for a glass of wine. Man, I'm sure glad that I did. A fantastic and unpretentious wine bar. Decor is totally comforting. Staff is so friendly. Has a great menu. Has a great wine list. What else is there to say? Thanks for the wonderful evening. We've found our local!",2
This place gets a solid two stars.the service is excellent i am having to stick to a certain healthily diet which sometimes makes it hard to eat out the waitress that we had was top shelf helpful.she took her time which s nice especially now adays.The food to my self and my guest the taste was very bland.the food looks great just bland.,1
"This is my GO TO store for all account and phone problems. I manage 6 phone lines every one with a different device insurance or not data, you get the picture . While I try to visit when things are less busy, I have never had less than excellent service. Reps are patient while we sort out different services, sometimes suggesting ways I can keep my costs lower. Great store!",2
"Not perfect, but great job. Good price and the guy in front doesn't put too much pressure on you to upgrade. I already know what I want when I go there, so I don't like the upselling pressure. I like the location because it's never super busy. I can go anytime and not have to wait on average more than 30 minutes.",2
"This was the first Greek food I have ever tasted and I must say wow. I may not be an expert in Greek cuisine but I know what good food tastes like. I got the Great Gyro with lamb and feta fries combo. It was one of the best things I have ever tasted, EVER. It was 11, but worth every penny and then some. They definitely made a good impression on me, and they have made a new repeat costumer.",2
"The hotel rooms are great, the price affordable, and the halls quiet. Loved the shower and a fan of the toiletries. Desk staff is competent and approachable. On site food options are more dorm room fair and the food options in the immediate vicinity are the same. Walk a mile and things open up a bit more.",2
Awesome and right around the corner! Beach burger is so good! And they have sweet potatoe tater tots! Also they always have amazing looking specials they post on face book. Have yet to try.but they always make me salivate! Craving a good cheap quick burger its your place! Not coporate chain good food good service! Definitely recommend!,2
"Ok.so, it's difficult to give this a star rating as I had a mixed experience. The caesar salad is one of the BEST I have ever had, but the pizza is one, if not the worst I have ever had. I ordered the margarita, sauce, cheese and basil. Well I think they may have run out of cheese and basil. It was a wet tasteless mess. I may return if craving a good caesar.",1
I go here for all my vitamieeds. Started going here when I found out I'm developing cancer. My doctor wanted me to start taking vitamins. The staff is friendly and attentive. Love going here because they carry coconut water by the cases. Best thing to drink ever. So much better than regular water and powerade.,2
"Don't get ranch chicken salad it's swimming in too much dressing, too many chips, too much salt on those chips, has a weird taste, literally almost no chicken, tiniest little pieces I have ever seen almost like they ran out of chicken and I got the scraps oh and wheres the lettuce? This place doesnt usually screw up.",1
"Went to this Arbys a few days ago because I was craving the Ultimate Angus Three Cheese and Bacon sandwich. The advertised picture of this sandwich looks amazing. Well to my surprise, once I received my sandwich, it looked like a totally different item. The bread was even different. It was horrible. I know food doesnt always look as advertised but this was not even close.",1
"This Goodwill is not great but not terrible. Every so often they have these sale days when everything is 50 off. Even then, though, a lot of items are more pricey than I'd expect for example, 5 t shirts and 18 for used jeans? That's more than I'd hope to pay and seems to take some of the ""thrift "" out of the ""thrift shopping "" experience.",1
"Awesome late night pizza! Friendly staff, and quick service. Lots of creative toppings, and nothing is skimped. nI had the gyro pizza and I think some sortof salad pizza. Both were great! nI opted out of the mac and cheese, I need to leave that for next time. I just wish I stopped by Moes across the street before eating the slices to try duff beer.",2
"I agree with all the other reviewers here. Blackstone is a fantastic course in great shape with excellent facilities. Just one thing if you are a member of the middle class, such as I am, and would like to visit the bar at the course, a third of a glass of bar wine will set you back about 15, gratuity included, of course. No cash accepted. This didn't ruin the golf it ruined my day.",2
"Was served two flat beers, the pizza for my two year old came out cold, along with cold stiff fries. The salads were fine, the shrimp I served was good. The service they do have down, the wait staff was gracious and did the best they could. The back kitcheeeds SERIOUS work. SERIOUS work. I will wait for a long time before I go back again.",1
"The tour isn't as busy on weekends and during lunch hours. Nobody was really making anything. The free samples are now at the counter where they'll ask you. The chocolate is good, but expensive here. When I bought a box of 4 seasalt caramels covered in chocolate , it was something like 8 dollars. Comes in a nice bag and Ice since it was summertime.",2
This place is my favorite place to get pizza in Las Vegas. My friends and I have been ordering from here for years! We will actually drive the 20 minutes from home to pick it up because it's that worth it. It's the best NY style pizza outside of NY and the Garlic Knots are to die for! It's a must if you're a local or staying at Red Rock Casino.,2
My health is better because I have been coming to Vitality Health and Wellness for the last two years. I like that Dr. Christy Thomas is integrative and combines traditional medicine with alternative wellness approaches. For someone wanting to be proactive with their health I would highly recommend scheduling a consultation.,2
"Taking into consideration the cost, I give it a two. I think the quality of the food has gone down since my last visit here and the price has gone up at least 25 . I didn't take any pictures because the place was crowded with patrons trying to put food on plates. Would I go back? Probably not, not saying it was bad, just not for me. Maybe I just outgrown it. Lol",1
"stopped by here on a Thursday around 5ish. Grabbing a bite for take out and to have a quick beer with a buddy. Beer was good, thats about it. Had the chicken Vesuvio, 2 pieces of chicken, one was a bone in half breast piece. the other was a flattened breast piece. looked like they ran out of vesuvio and let me have a marsala piece for replacement. horrible.",1
"It was soooo easy to book this appointment. I will definitely use Leo again and again! The ease of the process was just perfect. Leo was on time, courteous, responsive, and joy to converse with. There are a lot of car services in the Phoenix area, but none stack up to this company. nHe is now on speed dial!",2
"The food here was classic and really good. It had the standard items like crab, prime rib and pasta bar. Even with nothing special, this Buffett is really good. The food was prepared very well and the restaurant was clean. The staff was very responsive and friendly. I would return the next time I am in Vegas.",2
The D is one my wife's and I favorite spots. We love to hang out at the outside bar with the two best flair bartenders in town Christian and Martin and watch the interesting people who wander Fremont Street Experience. Its like getting two shows for the price of one! It's definitely a great spot to unwind after a long work week.,2
Awesome place! I love the unusual things about this place! It could be bigger because they are becoming more popular! Only thing is I was in the middle of writing this review and noticed everyone around us received their food before us when we say down before everyone. The food here is awesome but I do not like the inconsistency of the delivery!,2
"I went there again tonight hoping it would be a better experience and not because I wanted too but because of friends. It isn't busy enough to be slow or not take my drinks but again they just don't care there. I guess they don't want my money. I will never return. nPlease stay away, there are sooo many better places out there.",1
"Stopped in early Friday evening. One table left, ours. Snapper special included pork belly, cauliflower, fennel. Not a pork belly fan, but snapper was delicious. Also had the fettuccine, first time for this. Very flavorful. We shared a salad and some wine by the glass. my wife's new favorite is the French sparking rose took a bottle home. Another good night with chef Justin, Conrad and staff.",2
"Loved loved loved the fresh tortillas! I had the grilled chicken tacos with pico de gallo lettuce, side of black beans, no cheese. Lots of flavor going on here! nHubby had the pork tamale special it was moist and scrumptious ! My drink was the limeade with Jamaican flowers. Yum. Will definitely return! I want to try the shrimp tacos special on Saturdays.",2
The staff here are all friendly. One of the ladies had me bring in the brand I was feeding my dog and she reviewed the ingredients. She helped me find a brand that wasn't only comparable but better! Her knowledge was way better than the average big brand pet store employee. Love this place! Selection is great and staff really care.,2
"I've been disappinted, lately, in this salon. I really do not like that whoever is doing my manicure, pedicure or eyebrow waxing takes personal calls on her cell phone during the treatment. It could just be annoying, but the quality hasn't been good either. Eyebrow waxing was ok although there were the phone calls REALLY unprofessional , but the gels pedicure not worth it.",1
"I LOVE JIMMY JOHNS! Delicious, fast, fresh, cheap, and they'll even deliver just one sandwich! Plus they're open late, to cater to the night crowd. I order from them at least twice a week, and usually get the turkey tom or the beach club. Their bread is delicious they use real meats and cheeses unlike Subway , and even have fresh sprouts yum! . They don't toast their subs, so don't ask them ",2
"Cool decor and slide show with excellent pictures of Sammy Hagar. Unfortunately, this is where it ends. Ordered the burger melt and a draft. Beer was fine, burger lacked tremendously. Biggest shocker was the bill 10.59 for a draft? I thought it was an error but it wasn't. If you don't expect much, then you'll be okay.",1
"My first introduction to Pad Thai as a student and i'm still craving it 17 years later. It's by far the best i've ever had.and it's not just the food, it's the atmosphere. You caot help but feel the history of an old university when you eat in the wood panelled rooms at the YMCA building on campus where it is tucked away. It's super cheap too!",2
"I give this course 4 stars because of its challenge level. Not at all the most scenic golf course, but the gazillion hills create an extra level of difficulty. I'd bet money that this course was once a landfill yes, it happens . No flat lands accept for the middle of the fairway and greens. I do love the golf attendants uniforms.old school with the argyle socks and knickers.",2
"Great American, British and German style brews. Around 11 beers on tap and several beer cocktails mixing the basic brews. nTake out 22 ounce bombers or refillable growlers. nEnjoy food truck excellent chow Fridays or bring your own if nightly free popcorn is not enough. nAlways an oddball movie playing on the screen over the bar, while sports play on side wall screens.",2
"Livewire Karaoke is totally awesome! I've attended at least 3 of her events, fundraisers etc and she has everything you need to have a fantastic time. She has hundreds of songs to choose from and makes you feel comfortable even if you are ""microphone shy "". I highly recommend Tina Reynolds for your next event.",2
"FANTASTIC experience! Delic thin crust custom pizza.for 7.75.pile on the toppings and the crust is still crisp and the price is still 7.75. The salads are fresh and fantastic too. Service was outstanding fast, friendly and helpful. I will be going back every time I want pizza which is very often finally a great pizza place in my neighborhood.",2
"I like the variety of food that this place has to offer, but I often order the pizza because it's really good. The service is always exceptional. Oice days it's really nice to sit in their outdoor patio area. Sushi is pretty good here too, along with their seaweed salad. I didn't like their calamari though.",2
"To start with our luncheon last week, the front hostess was way rude and young. nThen was our waiter who seemed to be rude and showing no sings of enjoying his njob at this restaurant. Both my husband and I were talking about how people that work in this kind of environment in Vegas have become more and more rude and complacent with customers in the past years. Will not go back. Food was OK!",1
"Super fast service. They have different services from fingerprinting, notary, passport photos. There are different prices for fingerprinting, I'm not sure how the prices are figured out, guess it just depends on what you're getting them for. Anyways, I was in and out in ten minutes. Will send people here for sure.",2
Ok based on people's review I was expecting fabulous husband and I went in one night for some soup and sammies both of our meals were mediocre at best won't be back until we have exhausted all other options Food quality was ok the bread was nothing to write home about and is that not what makes a sammie? veggies were fresh and deli meat was meh. Sorry I wanted to love it ,1
"i lived here now for five years and it looks like i still fell into a tourist trap, was attracted from the outside by a a lot of nice bikes, inside nothing special .lots of room, not a bad property, n just nothing unique aside from extra motorcycle parking, the menu is struggling due to the lack of a kitche go there to drink beer and smoke cigs .and of course show off your sunday cruiser",1
"Eaten here several times. Each time we have been pleased with the food. The Tuscan harvest salad is delicious. The waiters waitresses are average and at times irritating due to lack of experience, poor serving and not checking on you. I would recommend this place to my friends and family. Just wish the service was better",2
"Beach party was erg cool! 2 zwembaden waar iedereen stond te feesten en de strandballen rond gingen terwijl de dj de speakers liet knallen. Man vrouw verhouding was goed. Verder waren eog private pools voor groepen en ligbedden. Super uitzicht over Vegas! De sfeer was erg goed. Vergeet niet je ID mee te nemen, anders kom je niet binnen.",2
"Delicious cute! Great place for groups, dress nice because this place is very posh! There's a great view of Bellagio's fountains if you're close to a window so you can enjoy the show as you're eating. The classic burger is so yummy and was such a hit with us! Definitely go next door and buy some yummy candy afterwards ",2
"I loved this place. It's kinda tough to find but right next door to the d.e.s. building. Food was good and the price was even better. For some reason the price is listed as but this was least expensive thai resaurant I've been to in the valley.My girlfriend and I had dinner and thai tea for under 20. Great atmoshphere, excellent service. Will definitly go there again.",2
"Ok.didn't even make it to our seats due to the rudest hostess service I've ever experienced. My mother asked what the soups of the day were and the lady pointed at a board that we did not initially see. Then when my mom asked, ""Where? "" the hostess snapped, ""Do you want me to read um to you? "" Then she turned to the couple behind us and asked if she could take their order. Crazy rude!",1
"My friends and I like to come here for the old school arcade games. They have a huge selection of games on two levels. We go crazy competitive on the basketball hoop game and I must also brag that I can beat anyone in Mortal Kombat. It's no Six Flags, but it serves its purpose. Fun little rides for some entertainment that bring us back to our childhood.",2
"I was in Charlotte for a class and stayed here. It was really nice, and the staff was great! I had never stayed alone in a hotel and got upset while eating in their restaurant and the wait staff took care of my meal! It was so nice! I can't say enough nice things about them! They made my trip better and made me feel so welcome! I'd definitely stay there again!",2
"Have had 3 bad experiences at this location. One was when they gave me the wrong food when I ordered online, then the next time they messed up half of my online order and then the 3rd time I went into dine they made my burrito so small it was not filling. They are extremely conservative with all of their burrito making. Would not recommend going to this location.",1
Perfect little spot for a coffee break. Yes it was pricey but the coffee was delicious just a bit on the sweeter side tho we ordered the caramel machaito and white chocolate latte both very good. i didn't have a problem with the service as other reviews. nthey have plenty of tables and chairs all around. Cute atmosphere very romantic.,2
"Most expensive bowl of msg laced imitation pho I've ever tasted. The service and ambiance are good, but the pho, bun bo, mi quang are not so good. The broth has no flavor, and the noodles are very starchy. For 11 13 a bowl, it'd be worth it to take a taxi to Pho So 1 in China Town for some real pho.",1
I think it's RIDICULOUS that I told the girl that I was sick in bed from a consussion and wanted to pay for the pizzas I ordered over the phone when it was delivered! I have ordered pizzas there MANY TIMES for years and this ONE TIME BECAUSE I AM SICK I wanted to call in with the credit card when it got here! Oh well they can forget my business FOREVER!,1
Had lunch at CIBO today. They only serve sandwiches at lunch. I had the eggplant sandwich. It was delish. Served with a side salad. Salad was just OK. Ice tea very tasty. Great urban feeling. I want to go back in the fall and sit outside at night under the little white lights with a glass of wine and enjoy Phoenix. And of course try one of their pizzas.,2
"Checked this place out after several times passing it by in the last month and after reading reviews. It was alright. Definitely nothing overly special. The prices are too high for such a small dog and sausage. For the price, I thought I was going to get the chicago real deal BIG dog and sauasage but nah. I didnt. i wont return.",1
"Burbon street stake was sizzling so hard when I got it that it popped me in the face with hot grease. It tasted great after waiting 5 minutes to feel safe to eat it. I orderd it medium rare. It was well done, not even pink in the middle. If that grease had left a mark on me, there would have been hell to pay. that's why you get one star. Though the waitress was very pleasant.",1
"i came here twice when i was in vegas, ehh i expected better, from all the rave i hear about this place. The presentation deceived me, i ordered the chicken and waffles, waffles had 2 strips on bacon inside which was tasty, but the chicken was just DRY. Ate a few bites and i was done. ill probably try something else on the menu if i ever come back.",1
"Met a group of people.great craft beer selection. ordered Old World Salad w House Dressing, excellent. enough to feed 2 4 people. nthen the Murphy pizza. applewood smoked bacon and onions w the thin crust, wood fired. This is an awesome pizza. The rest of the group got various pizzas and loved everything! Our waitress was great, and took good care of us.",2
Honestly the food was absolutely delicious. The only thing is upgrade for the onion strings they are far better than the fries are. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because of the service. Lack luster at best. It seems to be a bunch of college kids that really don't care about good service. I waited through one refill to even get a straw.,2
"My daughter and I used to live eating here a Friday dinner, Sunday brunch. The eating area is clearly separate from the bar yet for some strange reason, they refuse to allow families now. I'm sure they've lost money because of this. Other bars still allow minors, so we go there! Too bad maybe they'll change back.",1
"Cute menus playing off the restaurant's name by having the menu in photo albums whose concept comes from the owner's travels and including little touches and culinary influences on the menu. With a night time menu in addition to the brunch lunch menu, Caf u00e9 Souvenir is a perfect spot to either start or end your day. Brunch menu served daily from 7am to 4pm.",2
My wife and I started training with Andrea over a year ago. Since then we have both experience noticeable improvements in our health and physique. Andrea is the perfect trainer. She really cares about you and designs workouts specific to your body type. Her personality and enthusiasm make even the toughest workouts fun. She is the best trainer I have worked with. She deserves more than 5 stars.,2
"I am in freddys all the time, but today felt different. Everyone Seemed on edge and stressed out. It had me really concerned. But when i got to the cash register, James was there with his normal smile and a good attitude. He looked a little frazzled, but went out of his way to ask how my day was. He asked if I needed help. He made me feel important. Employees like that are why I keep coming back",2
"This show has been playing at vegas for well over 15 years. This is my second time watch the show. The first time was before I had kids. Now my kids are a little older, I figured I should bring them to see it too. They love the show. Mac king mainly does card and goldfish tricks. The show is good for kids. Not the best but not the worst either.",2
"I got a carrot, spinach and strawberry smoothie. Nothing special. It's something that I can make at home. I guess I was hoping for a better flavor or even texture. I'm actually gonna give this place a try again and maybe order something different. If it's better the 2nd time around, I'll change my review.",1
"the pizza arrived in 30 minutes, the crust was hand made and delicious, but all the toppings were concentrated in the center, and tasted like they came from a can, especially the olives and peppercinis. except the onion which tasted fresh. we gave the driver cash and he asked if we wanted change when there was a 8 dollar difference. lol, yea dude! we won't be ordering from here again.",1
"We decided to come here because of their great specials Wednesdays you get 20 off your entire bill Great wine and beer list, good cocktails plus a low calorie cocktail list we had some delicious sangria Nice outdoor patio and bar area with a lot of seating Overall the food was pretty good great for a casual weeknight meal. I would definitely go back for a reasonable, low key dinner",2
"Horrible horrible airline. The plane on my return flight could not even fit my carry on in the overhead luggage compartment. The airline failed to inform me of this before hand. During the flight, the flight attendant managed to skip my row when serving refreshments. I only recommend this airline for quick, cheap, last minute flights.",1
This walmart sucks! Very ghetto. Dirty dirty people dirty store. Staff is sooo rude. They messed up when we tried to return a 60 air matress without a reciept. Then when we came to return it with the reciept they said that we had already exchange it they wouldn't accept it. So now we have a 60 pointless air matress.,1
"Slow moving employees that don't listen to the order taken. We ordered 2 subs and payed 24. RIDICULOUS. When you swipe your card to pay, it's prompts a tip line. Seriously? Your getting paid an hourly wage to do you job, and they want a tip for the bad service they provided? No thank you, I'll go back to Subway.",1
Had lunch with friends and of course we were not disappointed. WCG is consistently good. Service and food terrific. We all has the Filet Mignon Chopped Salad. Yumm! I highly recommend WCG to everyone anytime! nAnother one of my fav's is the Maytag Burger.absolutely delicious! Go Visit White Chocolate Grill.you will NOT be disappointed.! Tell them Van sent you!,2
"Ok, I am of two minds on this place. The Hotel rooms are quite frightening mine had a leaky ceiling and was quite dark. However the room only cost 27 dollars a night so, you get what you pay for. In the casino the felts on many of the tables are worn and faded. All that being said it is still a fun place to walk around, just make sure you have all your shots.",1
Waitress hostess is horrible. I asked her in Korean how long the wait was and she COMPLETELY ignored me. I am used to bad service in Korean restaurants but this is first time a waitress did not even make eye contact. Food is average. Wait was long but only because they only have 6 tables with grills. It definitely is not because of their food.,1
"Had a positive experience at Salon D'Shayn. Was greeted upon entry and offered something to drink and a place to sit and wait I was early . Lia was cheerful, helpful, and easy to talk to. She gave me a great haircut, showed me how to take care of it, and answered my questions regarding hair coloring. The salon is small, but neat and clean. Plenty of parking on the street. Will be back!",2
"I was looking forward to my appointment after seeing all the great reviews, but sadly disappointed after going here. The doctor was so sarcastic and came off rude. I should have just left but needed to get glasses soon so I ordered from them and it took over a month to get my glasses in.the office was nice and clean but I will definitely not be returning",1
"i love how this place was open 24 hours. definitely a good spot to cure that hangover or attempting to sober up. from the time that we sat down, service was superb, however we had to flag down the guy for the condiments. the order and food came out super fast. they were definitely not cheap on the noodle and meat. two thumbs up ",2
"Once again, my first stop on the strip after a long flight from Chicago the weekend after Memorial Day. Was bummed to hear Jasoo longer was pouring here, but Blade was happy concoct a drink for me. He happened to be a big fan of Bulleit bourbon and made my 3 amazing drinks made with Bulleit. Still a great spot for eye candy while sipping well made drinks.",2
"Lavo nightclub was pretty fun, came here Friday night and enjoyed the vibe. The music wasn't my favorite, I prefer when a song I like is actually played for longer than 25 seconds before moving on. There is plenty of time to play the song, why ruin it by playing only a small portion. We did not eat here, so i cannot judge the food, but the club was nice, would come back, but not first choice.",2
"The service here today was terrible, the women helping us was extreamly rude was very sassy to me and my freind she was messing up our orders and they were moving very slow. Would not go back to this location ever and I work next door and we bring them a lot of business. If I could I would rate them at a zero!",1
"Wow the have to get it together, I came in for a to go soup and it took 20 minutes now I'm back to pick up something I forgot and have been standing here for 10 minutes while managers and servers walk around. nAnd yes there is a ration and charge for breadsticks, I thought these were bottomless. Meh. nMake eye contact, acknowledge the customer and provide service.",1
"I liked the carne asada cheese crisp and ceviche a lot. I ordered the carne asada chimichanga enchilada style meaning they put some sauce on top . I thought the sauce was good, but the meat itself was only ok. I was generally satisfied with my meal though. The service was very nice. Also, the portions are huuuuuge, so come hungry or be prepared to take some food home afterward.",2
"4.5 stars. The Johnny Johnny roll stands out mild spicy soft shell crab inside, tuna, avocado and special sauce outside. They will serve half rolls during all you can eat. The rice is exceptional a little more sweet than I am used to, but exceptional. Stellar cuts of fish for the nigiri! My husband's favorite was probably the Cajun Lover. I will definitely return.",2
"Great service, great food, great view Treasure Island pirate show . We go to vegas to dine and we found this restaurant to be a gem. It is in the Palazzo connected to the Venetian , and I would say the pizza and pasta is a must. We went with our 2 small daughters, and the wait staff and server made them feel at home. Thank you!",2
"i HATE the marquee. hate it. when i'm looking at tours and see 'marquee' as the venue i am generally so discouraged. i hate the parking. i hate the sound. i hate no re entry. the only things i like about the marquee are n1. that there is not a segregated area for the people under 21. n2. luckyman, the promoter, is insanely good to their bands, which is comforting.",1
"Stopped by the weekend they opened and the place was packed. The employees were friendly and fun, and obviously enjoy what they are doing. I've been back many times since and have ALWAYS loved my drinks and the service. The italian Soda's are amazing, and the Mocha Freeze was awesome too! My only complaint is that they used ""canned "" whipped cream, i wish they made it themselfs!",2
I've been going here for about 2 months now and they always take great care of me. Even when one of the techs messed up my nails I went back and Deena I think that was her name took care of me and I got everything fixed right away. They always remember me too which is very important to me. I would defiantly recommend them to all my friends!,2
"Best fish taco's I've had in a while. Grilled Fish tacos are fresh and with little bit of lime juice and Mr.Lee's special sauce they are like heaven. Tacos are about 2 piece and they compliment 2 beer perfectly. If you want to grab a quick grub that's somewhat healthy than I would highly recommend this place. Also, the bartenders are very friendly.",2
"Friendly staff, serene surroundings, lovely and clean facilities. I have received several services here and each has been first rate. The waterfall spa on the veranda is quite nice as well. Be sure to order lunch and sit in the atrium after your morning service. Highly recommend. A nice little spa boutique as well",2
"Nothing I can add that hasn't already been said in the many reviews left previously, but wanted to share my 5 stars. KA was an amazing, immersing show. I believe this is the only Cirque show in Vegas with a distinct story line. We got a discount on the tickets since we were staying at the MGM. I loved it so much I bought a shirt at the gift shop ",2
"I mistook this location for the horrible DD on Shea and Scottsdale Road and accidentally gave it a bad review. My bad! This location is definitely a good alternative to the poor service you WILL experience if you go to the lousy DD on Shea and Scottsdale Road. These guys look you in the eye, smile and make you feel like they appreciate your business. Oh yes, the donuts are great as well!",2
"STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION, Franchise needs BETTER MANAGEMENT AT THIS LOCATION. I love the Popeye's franchise and it's sad to have one so close to my house only to have inconsistent service and food quality. Every time I tell myself I will never go back.I do and to my dismay.angered and upset. Best advice being a FORMER avid fan.Stay Away. Drive to another location. Sad for the franchise.",1
"I'm spoiled by the old location we had here in Surprise where the staff was fun, friendly, and on point. This location, the staff is indifferent, in a rush, and don't even make eye contact with you when you order. I really hate that. The menu is the same and the food is good. But the staff is what really makes this location a 2 star joint. They really need to get a personality!",1
"A new tradition starts this year ! Santa at Rawhide ! The family had a great time with a tree lighting ceremony and a visit from Santa. The kids loved Santa real beard included , sat in his lap and we got a nice Polaroid to boot. Definitely better that any Department Store wanna be. Rawhide did a great job. Looking forward to next year.",2
"I have loved this place for so long and I can't believe I never thought to review it on Yelp! They serve delicious and fresh food. My personal favorite is the Sesame Tofu and Shrimp Egg Rolls. Great food and awesome people. P.S. Those people behind the counter, working diligently to make you an awesome meal would probably appreciate a dollar or two in the tip jar.",2
"I've grown up in AZ and remember coming to Native New Yorker for a long time. There wings were always top notch and the tastiest around. Recently, it seems like they changed the recipe for the wings and they are no longer as good. It's almost like there is too much breading on them. The place is still a decent neighborhood joint but I think the quality of the food has dropped over the years.",1
"A huge fan of Udder Delights. I have yet to have a flavor that I haven't cared for. The ice cream's texture is outstanding and is the only ice cream I can tolerate with my mild lactose intolerance. They have standard flavors, but I love the unique flavors like beet. I suggest taking a risk and going out of your comfort zone and trying something different.",2
Yeah the beer selection is ok. We ordered corn dogs. They came cold. We told the waitress they were cold so they microwaved the corn dogs and brought us the SAME ONES back. With the bites we still took out of them. All the chairs and tables are in poor condition. It just looks gross. I would not come back here.,1
"My kids love this place, just as much as I hate it. The food is worthless cardboard pizza. I spend to much money on ticket games. They need to step it up and actually get video games instead of token games. My wife claims the salad bar has given her food poisoning twice. Yet we keep coming back cause the kids love it. The stupid things we do for those that we love.",1
"Guess JITB is afraid of what people will say of the one they have on West Blvd. nWent to the one on West Blvd about a week ago , have not been in about 6 or 8 months, see thing never change, gangsta wannabes hanging out in dining area, management seems not to care, or are they intimadated by the GWB's Food was cold and greasy.This time I will stay away.",1
"Waited 75 minutes in line at 8 00pm despite at least 30 open tables visible. Staff didn't seem to care and were laughing while standing around their work stations. Expected the food to be worth it. Ribs were tough, enchiladas were hard. Dessert was good. I will never go back. Not worth the trip, even if you have the 24 hour pass.",1
"While most people rave about Pizzeria Bianco, I think LGO's pizza is way better. I don't think I've had anything here that I didn't like. It is definitely my favorite pizza restaurant in Phoenix. I highly recommend the roasted corn pizza. I can't come here without ordering it. Down sides it's always crowded during typical meal times and unless you're lucky, it's hard to find convenient parking",2
"Gorgeous furniture! We bought our couch from high cotton. LeeAnn helped us throughout the entire process. A month or so after we made our purchase, we had button come off of one of the cushions. We called LeeAnn and she sent someone from the store out to our home to fix it for free. Great customer service. We will definitely be back for more when we are ieed!",2
"Hands down the nicest hotel on the strip. OMG it's so nice. That's all I can say. They have gondoliers like Venice and the sky is breathtaking inside. Yea, it's all inside. Your life will never be the same after staying here. The only reason I'd consider giving it 4 stars is because it's too nice and now i dont want to stay anywhere else.",2
"I was excited to try a new Italian restaurant close to home. It's a cute little restaurant, good vibe, server was friendly. BUT when I asked questions about the menu she was not very knowledgeable. I do not know if I will return to give this place another chance. I wasn't too impressed with the food.",1
Sandwich lives up to the hype! The cornmeal breading is phenomenal and it isn't greasy like some others. As of 07 2014 food service stops at 7 PM on Friday. The sign looks like the one pictured but with a giant black 7 over the kitchen closing hour for Friday so I'd guess all the other hours are the same I didn't take a very good look as I was focused on the deliciousness before me .,2
"Cool indoor mini golf. I thought the 8 dollar fee was a fair price for the time you're able to spend here. The fluorescent lighting was a neat trick and I really thought the animal safari theme was nice. Great place for kids, they had an area for birthday pizza party's. Could get hectic if it was busy. I'd go back.",2
Everything from the fancy pool to the hipster rooftop is a must do in Phoenix. The staff their is very helpful and so sweet. Also if you're from out of town here's a FYI The sunsets in Phoenix are stunning. the Clarendon Rooftop is definitely the place to be when capturing the gorgeous sunset while sipping on a martini.,2
"Been here once awhile ago. Service is great. Sushi is not that great, too much rice on the rolls and little sashimi. The sushi doesn't seem very fresh. Maybe just this location. I also ordered steak and calamari. Honestly, I'd come for a drink or watch the games, otherwise this is not a dinner place nor do they have good food.",2
"This place is a joke worst service 3 out 4 dinners sent back 2 dinners still wrong the second time, manager doesn't even come back to check ruined our evening and still paid 125 for garbage you want good food go to Parma, this place is over priced over rated and the service and manager dont even care!",1
"This place is great. My wife and I went there for our anniversary and it was delicious. We had a sushi roll don't remember which one but it was very good. We also had the hibachi dinner.I had chicken and steak, my wife and steak and shrimp. Everything was VERY good. Also, it is nice how they cook the food in front of you. It is like a show and dinner. Overall a great experience.",2
"We've always been a fan of their wine and beer selection as well as their free wine tastings on Thursday nights. But the best part for us, is being able to order a glass of beer or wine from tap and enjoy it with other patrons or the wonderful staff. It's a friendly, low pressure way to spend some time with great beer and or wine and knowledgeable staff.",2
Had no intention of eating here but the places around were all closing for the night so we decided to give it a shot. The calamari was so fresh and tender. Probably the best I've had since right on the Mediterranean in Greece. The salmon was also cooked and seasoned very well. Service was quick and fast.it was the end of the night and pretty empty though. I'd come back here again!,2
"OMG! Lots of nice stuff to buy here. We had bought so many things at the nearby M M store, I could not buy much here. Have to get the stuff back home on an airplane tamps down the shopping. They also have coke floats and other tasty treats so bring your appetite. I could not eat or drink because I had eaten lunch already. On my next trip, I'll shop here first.",2
"I'm underwhelmed. It's good, but it's little. I ordered a brisket salad, the most expensive food on the menu at 12, and got a salad slightly larger than a side salad. It was tasty, but I'm still hungry right now. The horchata is excellent. I'm not a huge eater, but you need to be prepared to spend 20 or 25 bucks on lunch to get full. 2 tacos, one side, a drink, tax and tip.yup.",1
Stumbled on this restaurant for lunch today. The atmosphere was awesome. The food was fresh and delicious.even better the prices for lunch were really reasonable. Definitely going back to try more things off the menu. I was looking for Seafood noodle soup. I tried the Vegetarian instead and was not disappointed at all. nI really reccommend this place.,2
"Stayed here for the first time for Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly weekend. Amenities and customer service was awesome checking in, plenty of bars 4 and was able to just about fit the 8700 people that came for the event throughout the weekend. Only drawback is that the cafe food was just o.k, and the beds are hard as hell. The Pool area was rad and the bar was very handy. Can't wait til next year!",2
"This place has cool features.or does it? I didn't find any, lol. It's cheap. But with good reason. It's at the far end of the strip. It's not particularly nice. It's not particularly inviting, or fun. Why do I always stay in terrible hotels while in Vegas? I'm going to stay at Treasure Island next time!",1
"What a waste of money! I ordered BBQ chicken that was supposed to come with 4 sides. It costed 10.65, never again. The chicken was gross, undercooked, and I only got 2 sides. What a rip off! There's other places with much better quality food and for cheaper. Lesson learned. Don't waste your time or money at miga in the Greenland shopping center",1
"I called Nick for a list of things to do and he started a few things and I am so glad I called him. Nick does quality work,extremely honest,fair in his prices,and goes out of his way to please the customer. I can't wait to get the other things on my list done. I highly recommend Nick for. I won't call anyone else anymore.",2
"Ya know I thought the price was real cheap so I came to wonder why. I guess the neighborhood I dunno. Personally, I LOVED this hotel. It had a FULL kitchen and everything we needed get our groove on. Clean and quiet. The air conditioner was a little louder than I would have liked but it was close to the airport which was good enough for me. I would stay again, it was only 59.",2
"Good place to pick up some fresh Mexican food. We ordered a barbacoa burrito, steak quesadilla, and chicken quesadilla. As far as the burrito is concerned, I would say it's slightly smaller than a Chipotle burrito, but better tasting. Overall everything tasted good and was fresh. I would definitely return here again.",2
"The interesting things about Frank Lupe's are the name and the decor but other than that nothing else really stood out. Oh except for the chips, great chips, but a restaurant caot only be about chips. The food was mediocre I didn't even finish my enchiladas which is rare for me didn't find it was worth the calories. Might be a cool place for just drinks and app's but certainly not dinner.",1
"Penn Foster does not have regional accreditation which means their degrees are not widely accepted. Also, if some one from Penn Foster earns a bachelor degree and then wants to get their masters, forget it, will not happen without regional accreditation. If your going to spend the money and need to do it online find a school with REGIONAL accreditation.",1
"How horrible this place is! They committed to doing a fund raiser for Cesar Chavez elementary school, school sent flyers, promoted them. Then decided to not follow through because they ONLY support Arcadia High School. Sad that a group of elementary school students had to miss out on their fund raising opportunity.",1
"i was very disappointed today. when i found out from the sporting good manager.RICK.mention they do not carry buss worm bedding. ni was just ready to leave the store, when i came across an older gentlemeame JIM, in sporting good. I ask him if they carry buss worm bedding. he answer yes and took me to the section. He was very nice and helpful and was able to answer all my question.",1
"Have been to Cyclo twice. Both times the food was very good. Ate both times in the late afternoon. Good service.an unanimated, but effiicient staff. Start with the pork and shrimp spring rolls, move on to the crisp lemongrass chicken or pad thai, end it with one of their unique desserts.and you have a meal that is sure to satisfy! Beware the plum soda! LOL That's all I have to say about that.",2
Great ambience. Love the red walls and fake candle lit tables. The server wish I remembered his name was so great. He was warm and friendly. The server gave us tasters of the sangria which I ended up ordering two glasses. Yum. The food was above average. Overall this place was great and glad to find it. Seems like a fun place go come to for brunch with the girls and drink sangria.,2
"Great store for clothes and shoes. if you are a bargain shopper that doesn't mind scouring the racks. You may have to look for a while, they have a huge selection of clothes and shoes. Their accessories are totally lacking, if not cheap. Stay clear. Definitely should be one of your ""drop in "" shops.",2
"Do NOT stay here. I was here for two nights and was robbed. Even though it was just food and drinks that were taken, I can't believe that I was there less than 24 hours and someone came into my room and took stuff out of the frig. Ridiculous. I was very angry. And their towels are like sandpaper. I literally had to pat myself dry. I am NEVER staying here again.",1
When you eat the real deal I guess you're a lot tougher. I had laksa there. VERY ho hum and way way way too large. No reasonable person can eat a huge soup like that and since when is laksa supposed to be that soupy? And.unfortunately.it tasted.well.prepackaged. Their other Asian cuisine isn't bad. I guess for Charlotte it's a bit of an adventure but I found it rather generic.,1
"Meh, for sure. Since we were staying at the hotel we thought we'd pop over for a drink and light app. What a weird space! Here we are, in the middle of a desert with gorgeous views, land, and sky to see, and this dungeon is what we have available to us. Service was fine. The bartendress was nice. The food selection sucked, and our cheese platter was sub par. What a waste of space.",1
Food was so so service slow. Servers don't pay attention. God awful ugly waitresses. Annoying crowd and unfriendly atmosphere is probably due to the demographic of the area. Buffalo chicken sandwich was ok. Side of fries should be bigger. Wouldn't recommend this location. The Chandler location was much better.,1
"I ate lunch here a few weeks ago and it was a nice change from the food you usually find here in AZ. The Kool Aid and Tea served in Mason Jars was pretty need. I had the chicken tenders and waffle combo and to my surprise, I liked it! The service was good, not great, but good. Portions were large and the food was good quality. I will eat there again for sure.",2
"This is our new Place, we go every Wed for great food and Team Trivia. All servers and fantastic and by your second time visiting tailgaters you feel like a friend. Some of my favorite menu items are the pizza and wings hot honey of course but also the French dip and Philly cheese steak are great! come visit this friendly place for a drink and have some great food. you won't regret it",2
Despite the size of the Kohl Center it is a great environment to watch some Big 10 basketball! It is on the bigger end of basketball arenas for the Big 10 conference. It is number 3 in size behind Ohio State and Indiana. The students are into the game which is nice to see. There are even decent views of the court from the high up sections.,2
"These pizzas are similar to those we got in Italy. Thin, crisp crust, not soggy from too many wet or greasy ingredients. Order them with just a couple of ingredients, like mushrooms and cheese, with a glass of wine, and pretend you are in Rome or Sorrento. That is how pizza should be. Had to make my own at home on the grill until I found Grimaldis. Lot of work saved.",2
"The theaters here have been well covered by previous reviews. I like Regal Village Square because it's less hectic than others. Parking is easy and the numbers of people going here seems to be less than Regal Red Rock. It's about the same distance for me to go to Red Rock or Village Square, and for most movies, I choose the more laid back atmosphere of Village Square.",2
wow. this was comp'd buffet and i thought id try it nall i can say is i would rather pay to go somewhere else n nfood is dry and terrible nno flavor at all ni wouldnt be surprise if it came from a ca ndont waste your money here nup the road is Aliante Buffet at Aliante Casino nSo much nicer nand WAYYYYY better food,1
stopped by here because i didnt have time to make it to my regular shop. the cashier bella was not friendly. when my drink was ready she sat it at the pick up station where i had to REACH to get it then she walked away.chinatown is the best gor friendly staff. my green tea is alright. wont return or recommend to anyone,1
"Nice room, but this place needs to step up their breakfast. I feel that when I book a 3 star hotel I'm paying for a decent quality breakfast. That is not the case here they had eggs, sausage, gravy, biscuits, waffles really a good selection, but the quality was a step down from anything you would want to put in your body.",1
"Billing is a huge problem! I was being charged 98.00 and 56.00 every month. We had to block them as a vendor and after emails saying the would correct it, we still get charged or attempts to run the card. They asked to hold the card on file for a month to month membership and it somehow turned into financing their gym. Same with my brother in law. It seems criminal.",1
Try the gazpacho. I never had it before and was reluctant to try cold soup but I was not disappointed. Cold soup in the Arizona summer was perfect. I usually like to get the Greek salad. The food is always fresh and tasty and the staff is very friendly. I like to go there when I feel like eating healthy.,2
"On My 1st trip to Montreal, I was determined to have poutine. Everywhere I read said this place had the best poutine. I finally made it here on my last day in Montreal and at 1st was a bit worried by the appearance. But, when I let the salty, saucy goodness touch my mouth, I was in poutine Heaven. I still dream about this place. Definitely grab a seat, get a order and enjoy a beer.",2
"Intimate and and absolutely delicious.muscles, flatbreads, lamb, risotto.it's all amazing and expertly crafted. The flavors sing and the wines are beautifully chosen. Do yourself a favor, go and put your experience in the Chef's hands. Eat and drink what he recommends. It's a gem of a place and one I am grateful to have in my hood!",2
It was very disappointing to wait in line for one hour to buy a ticket for Body Worlds and then to find out at the ticket counter we'd need to wait over 2 more hours to get into the exhibit. Why no sign or greeter at the door to let us know that it would be 3 hours total wait? Big miss on their part and more than a few irritated people.,1
"This is my favorite bar in Madison. It has a great atmosphere and good energy. There's always a lot of people there, but it's never too crowded to find a table. They have a nice beer selection, with lots of local Wisconsin brews to pick from as well as staple German and Belgian beers. I love this bar!",2
"Love this place. The folks who run the chairs know how to provide a good cut. My Barber is Bruce Lee, and he does great work. Highly recommend him. This place is great. I can elaborate about the leather chairs, good magazine selection, and warm feel, but ill leave that to the reader to check out. Located in the smiths shopping center off Horizon Ridge and eastern. Go check it out!",2
We've been shopping here for two years. We have bought games and had consoles repaired. We have enjoyed coming by even if we have to travel from the SW area. I think they are hiring new employees because we just received the worst customer service! 2 stars for our previous experience but now very disappointed we won't be going back.,1
LV Yelpers. stay away! Came here the other night for dinner since I was craving fish. I waited over 30 minutes to be seated. nCrab soup was horrible. no taste. nFish wasn't cooked throughly. I had the trio and rainbow trout nlomi salmon wasn't done right. Management and customer service was horrible with compensation for bad service. I won't be back. NEXT!,1
I was so disappointed by my dinner here! I had a chicken dish that tasted really bad. The sauce was runny and had an odd flavor. Everyone in our party agreed that the food just wasn't good! It's quite pricey too. I will NOT be returning. I feel bad for them because a lot of restaurants go out of business on Market Street. They really need some help here!,1
"It's quite a standard to have fresh shrimp cocktales, but there were no crab what so ever. Other hot dishes are typical, I don't feel like I see anything flavorful and unique, as you can see, I really don't remember it after eating there twice already. Sad to say, but I'm not eating for the looks, I'm eating for the flavors.",1
"Delivery was quick, service was fine, prices were low. That's the only reason I give them two stars. The chicken was chewy and tasted like a freezer even through the breading and sauce. The rice had a TON of onion in it. I like onions more than most people and I still thought it was far too much. Also, the portion of rice was tiny.",1
"I have found quite a few favorites that have turned into a weekly ritual. First, a sandwich or a burger on their pretzel roll is delicious. On the sweet side, they have an almond horseshoe shaped baked item that is tasty and makes for an excellent non traditional dessert or as a morning treat with your coffee.",2
I go to register my father's car Disabled Vet I bring in the insurance and the card shows a date for 1 day from now.I told the clerk that this is the card they sent and they told us to use this one as the temp cards could be disgarded. Car was insured day he bought it. Clerk said no I need today's date makes no sense. So I just wasted 2 hours.,1
Went to lunch here. Would actually give 4.5 stars really if that was option. Exceeded our expectations of hotel lunch dining. Service was truly excellent. Posole was flavorful and so were chicken and carnitas tacos. Had guacamole prepared table side appetizer free as part of Marriott elite resort fee package so extra good. Tasteful decor.,2
"Bravo is pretty much the Italian version of the Cheesecake Factory. Their interiors are so similar I wondered if the two were related, but they don't seem to be. That being said, I had some of the best eggplant parmesan I have ever had here last night and I am a big fan of eggplant. It was even good leftover for lunch today.",2
"We stop in every now and then. The food is consistently good with a variety of tasty dishes. With Carrabas and Olive garden as the only other Italian eateries in Surprise, this is the go to place, when my inner Guido calls out for Chicken Fettuccine or a calzone. My son loves the kids size pizza pocket Its ten times the size of a normal one he points out .",2
"I have had quite a bit of Indian food in my life and this has been by far the best. Four of us stuffed ourselves into a food coma. The ingredients were all fresh, the lunch specials such a great deal. The flavors were out of this world. I want to go back soon, I am getting hungry thinking about it. Great service also by the way. They were attentive, friendly, and quick.",2
"We met family here today for lunch. We all tried something different, and I don't think anyone was disappointed. The red chili salad was absolutely delicious. My husband had the Greek chicken salad sandwich and sisters in law shared a kale salad. We shared a brownie for dessert. Keep up the great food!",2
"I have been looking for a good massage therapist for some time. A good friend suggested I try Pam at intuitive Touch, and I'm so glad I listened! I have degenerative disc disease and fibromyalgia and Pam knew exactly what I needed. Great location, relaxing atmosphere, very reasonably priced and amazing massage! I found exactly what I have been looking for! Thank you Pam!",2
"We decided to try this place instead of Tea Lite Cafe because Tea Lite has a rude man there always accusing me of taking soda from machine for free. First time, the nvermicelli pork was good. The second time the pho tasted like canned broth with too much anise. My child said it was the worse he has ever eaten. Don't go there for pho. The atmosphere is good but the food is just too terrible.",1
"Love Kohl's, have been there twice in the last month, they keep sending me coupons through the mail, 10.00, coupons, I can purchase a blouse that is regular price of 38.00, on Sale for 14.99, and only have to pay a little over 6.00, using my coupon, they always have Great Sales ! And it is right up the street !",2
"This place used to be a deal I guess by the old reviews but now it's not, you call and get quoted a price then walk in and they give you a different price. 12.50 for a suit and they have it ready in 3 4 days 7.50 for a single suit jacket is a rip off in my book when all they are doing is steaming it and comes back with lint balls and loose threads, the guys English is hard to understand",1
"If I could give zero stars, I would! nWent to Lauren Coulter for a color package purchased thru Groupon and, oh no, never again. She FRIED my hair! Tried to get back in to see if there was something that could be done and she was ""unavailable "". Waited two weeks for an appointment and waited nearly 30 minutes before I gave up and left. Horrible experience!",1
"the worst fucken club ever! the ""bouncers "" suck at doing their job. first of all they were extremely rude. second they said my ""id "" was fake! after showing them other id's they still said no. we asked for management and he told me ""im not getting anyone for you "" this was that one fat bald light skinned bouncer. makes me not even go to mgm anymore!",1
"This is the worst bar in the airport, and possibly the worst in the state. I've twice now sat at the bar for more than 5 minutes without being offered a drink, so I just get up and leave. The service isn't that bad it's not good either when you get a table, but the food is awful, and the prices for the awful food are horrendous even for an airport. My advice? Avoid this place.",1
Im not the type of guy that likes going places to look at flowers. But this place is cool. They make so many different things out of plants on a huge scale. I wont lie I like walking around checking it all out. They change what they put up with the season. Around the holidays this is a great place to check out especially if you brought kids.,2
"I Hop rocks. nFast friendly service food is great coffee is super. You get a pot of coffee on your table that you drink as you eat. Unlike Dennys where you have to hold your cup up in the air like a beggar,begging for money. nThanks to two I HOP waitresses Autumn and Cara for excellent service with a smile.",2
Was staying at this hotel and the security completely refused to be reasonable and evicted us without offering to relocate when we got noise complaints. I was in a suite with a stripper pole in the shower. What kind of room has a stripper pole in it that isn't expected to be loud? Never going back. Stupid.,1
"This is a fun little bistro that let's you bring your own wine. My Dad lives in FH and it is a frequent stop for us when I am in town. If this was in NYC or LA I'd give it 3 stars, but for metro Phoenix is deserves 4 stars because there are SO many chain restaurants here in AZ. Therefore, when you find a privately owned place that serves good food with the personal touch I am always a fan!",2
"Absolutely nothing special. Their ""signature "" chicken fingers are OK but seriously bland.Chick Fil A is far better and so is KFC and even Carl's Jr. It's hard to see how they compete with such mediocre offerings. We tried the Box combo with Texas toast, cole slaw, fries and 4 fingers for 6.79. I would have hoped their breading batter was tastier or even spicier.anything to add more flavor.",1
"I had the Tuscan chicken 3 cheese. Very yummy and served with a side choice. I chose the sliced fruit. I can say it was worth the 10.not for just the food but the ambiance. I'd come back here to try another hot sandwich. Just keep in mind, at this moment the caf u00e9 is still cash only. Walk across the street grab yourself some cash and get here for a nice sandwich.",2
"Great new concept in Cityscape! We stopped by for lunch on Friday and were quite impressed. I love the make your own pizza concept and see that many others in the neighborhood do too. We split an Island pizza and thoroughly enjoyed it nice atmosphere, friendly staff, great prices and good food. What more can you want?",2
"Seriously awful , I had a burrito which was plain and tasteless, chips were junk and salsa was a joke. Really too bad this place will fail like others in this spot. What Mexican joint serves ravioli? I guess hacienda is trying to redefine but with no success. Go to rubios and you'll get better taste.",1
"Came in for dinner on a Monday night and the place had a few other people eating, but otherwise empty. We ordered spicy tuna, California and Philly rolls. We felt like it was very average sushi. Also ordered the chicken wings, which did not match the menu description of asian flavored wings, instead came out as normal buffalo wings. Only 5 in the order for 6. Would not come again or recommend.",1
DELICIOUS! really great service and HUGE portions. Very fresh and hip atmosphere. Lots of attention to detail. There is a huge out door seating area lots of interesting flavors for pancakes. I really wanted a coffee but didn't and the espresso smelled SO GOOD. This place is great! We went on our lunch hour and it was quick service for a large group!,2
would have loved the opportunity to actually view the class schedule before getting the sales pitch. unfortunately you cannot do that on the website. you first have to click on the member non member option at which point you are directed to some bs window with two attractive people trying to sell you on why you should become a member. just a hint i won't be joining. ultimate fail.,1
"They have got the best accessories here. Its like walking into a jewelry box, cool stuff at every nook. Inexpensive and cute jewelry. They have colorful and hip bags and shoes. I love the quirky gifts they have here. I could shop here all day. Clothes wise only small, medium and large. So really cute but really small. Most of America will have to find their cute clothes somewhere else.",2
" 40 cover on a dead Friday night? TERRIBLE! No chicks, decent music though! Good DJ on the Friday night of Nov 23, even though there was no one really there. Miss the good ol' days of when they had Steve Aoki, but I guess he took his act on the road as of late. Me and my friends wish would have just given the 40 cover to the blackjack dealer. haha.",1
"This place should be called Pick up Sodium. Everything is over seasoned and high in Sodium. The Beef and Broccli has 2190 grams of sodium on a 620 calorie dish! The chicken teriyaki bowl with white rice has 4200 grams. Samurai Sam's chicken teriyaki bowl, large has 940 grams, while the regular bowl has 520 grams. Skip this place.",1
"I love this place and have been meaning to write a review for awhile. I've always had their burgers and chicken sandwiches. I eat them and think, wow, why can't other burger places get with the program?! Lol. It's a far drive for me so I only stop when we're in the area. Brunch is great too. And their drinks, yum, they know their drinks!",2
"Stopped in on a scorching Saturday afternoon with a group for a quick lunch. Seating was limited but we were practically the only ones there at that time of day so it didn't matter. We weren't expecting much, just typical bar fare but we were all impressed. Good menu selection and when I got my food it was delicious as was everyone elses. I'd go again, no doubt!",2
"I stopped by here after going to the Bookman's that on the same NW corner of Southern Ave Country Club. I got a piping hot fish sandwich with light tarter sauce. It was yummy. The young man at the counter was very friendly, and the inside of the Arby's looked great. There is also a Goodwill and a 99 Cent Only store at that same complex. I included some photos in my review.",2
"Decided to go here on a whim because they have a clever name. Turns out that's really all they have going for them, besides the cold beer. The food was forgettable, the atmosphere was bleh the service was slow and the decor was like a failed attempt at Applebee's. Needless to say, I won't be going back any time soon.",1
"It was average in atmosphere. Not busy or even steady for lunch on a weekend. The hostess and waiter appeared they wanted to be elsewhere every time I have gone. I can cook better than this place. So this is a definitely will never do again. I'd rather do fast food to get by instead, not a place to take a first date or any date.",1
Went here a year ago and had an amazing time with great good but this time around i was disappointed i didnt even finish my meal. Drinks are moderately priced and so is the food. The waiter took 45 minutes to even approach the table and when she did she brought us chips and salsa tasted like tomato sauce and then she returned 20 minutes later to order. Food came out cold and bland. Never again.,1
I have stayed here before without any issues. This last stay of 6 nights was a different story. The first night we had loud and rude neighbors. The sixth night and seventh day our room smelled like pot. The cleaning people did a crappy job and the hallway looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in quite a while. I will not be staying here again.,1
"It's amazing how much variety Antonio's has in their pizza. I usually get a slice of avocado enchilada and a slice of buffalo chicken. The people working are generally quite nice, and the food is cheap and delicious. Once they didn't have any avocado enchilada, so they made it for me on a slice of cheese they were so accommodating, it was wonderful.",2
"Love this airport. Even at night, it's busy, don't be fooled. Also dress for it, at 11PM it's 99 degrees still. Terminal 4 isn't busy, but the others will be due to red eyes east. If you need a ride, no family or friends will come out, find the people in blue at Super Shuttle. Awesome and reasonable! Welcome to PHX!",2
I've lived here for over 2 years now and the staffing that work here are horrible. The complex is kept looking nice from the outside but nothing is ever done to update the inside of the apartments except fresh paint. They half ass everything. Only gave 2 stars because it's the nicest complex in this area and they don't have breed restrictions on dogs.,1
"Probably the best mojito of my life, and the cigar was not bad at all. Amazingly, the help made a great recommendation. Asked for something smooth with a vanilla draw, all though they do not stock my personal favorite, Montecristo, Arturo Fuente makes an awesome cigar. Great place to rest and take it all in.",2
"To be honest, the food there is not very clean, all the food you ordered is in one big plate, no matter it is seafood or vegetables. In addition, the tables are greasy. They still charged 2 pounds for 2 person's set. I felt sick in half eating but continued to finish. The waiter was nice, but the hot pot was really not tasty. I will give it 40 out of 100.",1
My pregnant wife and I just tried to eat here and after we were seated no one decided to actually come by and give us any help. So after close to 20 mins staring at the waiters and waitresses to see if maybe they would decide to come by and do their job we left. If you are in a hurry or hungry I would advise to find another place. I would've give this place zero stars if i could.,1
"service was great! then sushi came rice fell apart when i picked it up, ikura had a very sweet taste not common my daughter who loves them could'nt stand the taste. nother nigiri was dry, salmon skin hand roll had only bits and pieces. my daughter had just the the salmon off my nigiri the waitress wanted to charge me the ayce price! for her WTF! did i mention the 45 min wait at 5 30pm.",1
"I've had Einstein bagels in the past and this is the first time they were super greasy! They weren't horribly bad, but I probably wouldn't return to this location again. It is convenient since it's in the airport, and the service is friendly, but I would recommend trying other meal options before coming here.",1
Of course the beef wellington was amazing. it goes without saying. The service was pretty good and attentive. The food is very expensive of course and there are far better places to eat in Las Vegas for the prices they are charging in here. I guess thats to be expected though after all Gordon Ramsay is a Super Star . LOL,2
"Table had a great view of the strip, but both the food and the service were a disappointment. Beef tartar lacked flavor and had a poor presentation in a jar. Beet salad was mediocre. Brussels sprouts were overpowered by spice. Burger was average. Overall, there a much much better options for a great meal in the Cosmo.",1
Boyfriend had his hair cut by Rosa this time since Emily wasn't in. Big mistake. He came home and I immediately began laughing at the horrendous mess on his hair she faded his hair much higher than he asked and the top was really choppy. We went to Emily the next day to fix it. Don't go to this place without asking for her.,1
"I would again after 2 days of repeated problems warn all busy professionals or anyone who wants to partake of the freaky fast and freaky horrific service of jimmy johns to stay AWAY. The food is fine but beware that you will not get what you order. You will however get attitude, and poor service FREAKY FAST.",1
"Ok, I went back and I had the BBQ Chicken Pizza. I added bacon. It was completely and ridiculously delicious. The chicken was tender, juicy and delicious. It tasted like it had just come right off the grill! I absolutely recommend trying the specialty pizzas. This place is great and a treasure in my local area!",2
"Great Gym, I joined at the Aliante location however I go to this location because of the pool. I have never had any customer service issues. I kinda hate the fact they quit showing movies in the cinema after 10 because most of the time I caot get to the gym until about 11 pm. Other than that I love it. nI had to revise my post about golds, you will see my post from 3 26",1
Folks this is very overrated. they had Guy's Diners Drivein and Dives there only because Guy's parents knew owner. This is very avg food at best. Its nothing special.I wont go back. Very small and uncomfortable. They have a large sign in window to play on Guy's visit a number of years ago. Dont fall for it.,1
"Great location and outdoor seating was worth the wait. The food was not! The scallops were done well, but not cleaned very well as they had sand in them. I ordered gnocchi which came raw. The pasta was raw and still stuck together. They replaced it with an order of ravioli. Unfortunately the pasta cook must have beeew because these came out raw in the centers. Not worth the price.",1
"Never coming back again. They did a good job on my pedicure, BUT they were super pushy n The lady who did my nails totally kept pushing for me to get the deluxe pedicure . the minute I got there, during she was doing my manicure.to the time was almost done with my service. Never ever again! Go somewhere else. They're expensive too. I don't know what the whole hype is all about",1
"Awesome prime rib, creamed corn, Yorkshire pudding, spinning salad, bread basket, creme br u00fbl u00e9e. I just wish I had more opportunities and money and calories to eat there! Old fashioned inside but classy not hokey. Beverly Hills does not have a kids menu but the Vegas one has chicken fingers for finicky kids like mine.",2
"Complete sausagefest. I was with a group of 4 attractive ladies and they kept letting iothing but white guys. Seriously, WTH. I understand there has to be a certain ratio, but while we were waiting there was nothing but guys going in and a ton of good looking girls outside looking pissed. Complete fail.",1
Walked in really unsure that I wanted to try their food. Seemed to much like a Scottsdale bar to be a good burger joint. Have to say that after a couple minutes I was surprised that I was wrong. Staff was friendly and helpful. The burger options were pleasant and the food was fantastic. A little pricey to be a place to go to often but I will be back.,2
"Charming breakfast, brunch, or lunch spot! Unique and savory menu, a coffee bar, several delicious pastries and desserts, and a huge selection of root beers! I'd recommend this spot for brunch or an afternoon root beer and dessert tasting. The only thing I would change is to have some more vegan options. Service is great too.",2
"Came for lunch. We work right down the street on Princess. It was great. Burger was cooked just as I asked and was out to our table in about 15 minutes. I remember telling my wife, the patty is still hot. That is how freshly cooked it came to out table. The house made potato chips were great too, thick cut and fried crispy. Messy burger but very enjoyable.",2
"Yes, it is cool to have a pita jungle in the mall. The falafels are good, as is the chicken and hummus. However, I asked for no onions and got a LOT of them, all the pitas were cold and so hard they hurt to chew, and the girl who took our order was cold and expressionless. I prefer the restaurant locations.",1
Service was descent but the crab cakes were burnt! This was my first time here and will most likely be the last. The waitress saw that my crab cake was completely black on the bottom. Obviously they put the lesser burnt side facing up hoping that I wouldn't notice. The rest of the food wasn't much better.,1
"I ordered flowers through ftd.com this company was suppose to handle the order. On Valentines day FTD and I tried to call to find out where the order was, NO ANSWER. The next day when I spoke with them the excuse was that they were busy it was Valentines day. Really who would of thought that would happen. They never delivered the flowers, even though everything was at a premium. STAY AWAY",1
Rating on food alone. Service was great. Ate the miyagi San burger but my egg was well done and I was looking forward to a runny yolk since there was not really a spread. BUT the crispy onions were great. Got the calamari but it tasted like raw flour. I don't think I will come back being that this was my second upset here.,1
Great place to take out of town friends. Excellent happy hour specials delicious pizzas. There was a period where service was a bit lacking waiting over a hour for food but things seem back to normal now. I've been coming here for over 10 years overall the service is great and you can't beat the ambiance.,2
Me and a co worker ordered a couple of burgers from this place. One well done and one medium well. Both of our burgers were raw. Took one bite out of the burger and spit it out. When I went to show the manager he said it was medium rare. Don't make up excuses fix the problem. That burger messed up my entire day.,1
"Beautifully understated transcendental decor completely compliments the visually arresting and thoroughly satisfying menu offerings. It was perfect place to take my wife on her birthday and we threw caution to the wind and ordered whatever we wanted, without fear or favor. Very nice West side establishment.",2
Came to this McDonald's a couple of times and tried to order a few drinks and their machine did not work for anything. No hot chocolate no hot mocha no anything. On top of that the lady in the drive thru said it hasn't worked for a couple of months. A multi million dollar company and they can't fix the machines? Wth? Not coming to this mcd again. And they are slow 10 mins to get a drink.,1
"Great view outside. Seating area inside. Decent sized dancefloor. Music was good because I was dancing! I left when it was just starting to get CRACKIN because my group was moving on over to Ghostbar. Pre drink before because a shot of hennessy with coke back and just a plain ol' Redbull cost 20. but who am I kidding, BARS are always overpriced!",2
"If there is such thing as ""no star "" that will be how I would have rated this place. Went in for a haircut and came out with chopped. Even showed picture and all, when the stylist started cutting I knew I was in trouble. I came back after 2 days to get it fix but was told the same person who cut my hair originally would have to do it. Will not go back nor recommend this place.",1
Ordered the Carne Asada plate! So much TASTE in the marinaded steak! about 7 and I ordered NO CHEESE due to my lactose intolerance and they were very curtious and took my request seriously. I will be going back to this hole in the wall and the lady behind the counter recommended that I get the Burrito and Taco combo next time!,2
"I ate here for brunch with my family. I thought the food was lacking in creativity. There was nothing special about the food. The service was good. The atmosphere was fun looking out onto the casino. The food was overpriced for what you were getting, which was simple plates. So, I don't recommend it to those on a budget and want good chinese food.",1
"Fantastic food all around. I love my hanger steak salad. steak was cooked to perfection and the seasoning? yum! Everyone at our table was quite happy with their dishes. If you want to stay away from the ""restaurant row "" at Cosmo and still want to catch great food, this is the spot. We also loved our own little private booth too. Good atmosphere for conversation.",2
"THIS IS A REVIEW BASED ON TAKE OUT ONLY! I had been craving Indian food, and my girlfriend brought it over for a movie night. I had Chicken Tikka Masala with garlic naan. It was flavorful, perfectly spiced, the chicken was tender, the naan was SO delicious. this was the best take out I've ever had. EVER!",2
"Great food and great service! Came here last weekend on a Sunday night and didn't realize they were closing for the evening. The owner opened the door and said to please come in with such sincerity. We ended up deciding to stay and are so glad we did! Got their egg rolls, Thai tea, massaman curry and fried rice. It was all delicious! Going back tonight ",2
"Dr. Hogan is the best dentist ever! She's a nice person and very gentle with your teeth, and not to mention honest. I always get anxiety when I have to go to the dentist, but not with Dr. Hogan. I have been with her for over 3 years now and will never change dentists. My kids go there as well. Everyone in the office is friendly and the office is always clean.",2
"Was not impressed with my burger at ALL. Very bland and when you're paying 15 dollars for a burger, it better taste amazing. My favorite part of the meal was the fries. And to top it off the server we had was inattentive and impatient with our table. I felt more like I was doing him a favor by getting my order done than being cared for by him. sigh so much potential. So little follow through.",1
"Went there for lunch with the hubby, and the breakfast was horrible. The slice of ham was thin leathery to the point of being unable to cut into it. The hash browns were dry and tasteless. Even the toast was badly done, one dot of butter in the middle part of burnt dry toast. I'll give them credit for the eggs, and that's it.",1
"2 for 1 happy hour from midnight to 4am Sunday to Thursday is great! Prices are a little higher than I had hoped but they made up for it with the portions there. Easily the best late night sushi place I've been to in Vegas and I plan on going back soon. Its closer than ""I Love Sushi "" in Henderson which is my fav so I will just come here when I can't schlep it all the way over there.",2
"I have found the BEST place in LV to take your child, if you want to stay out the heat and have a fun and safe play place for your child Fidgets is the one and only place to be. Fun safe and friendly environment for the whole family. There's also a place to feed your children, u could do any anything and everything for kids here. Plus it is very CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN!",2
"Wow, I will never be coming back here again. Ordered a crab salad sandwich and then proceeded to wait for 50 minutes. When my table's food arrived, I had no sandwich. I was not about to wait another 50 minutes for my food so I left. nThe table next to me was complaining that they had to wait 20 minutes to see their server to get their checks to leave.",1
"I should have tried the Sunday brunch buffet months ago. The offerings are spicier than their regular offerings. I especially liked the chicken mole and the pozole. They have lots of other things, including chile verde and some kind of stewed beef dish I didn't ask because I'm allergic to beef . And it's only 12 including a non alcoholic beverage.",2
"The website gives me the ability to order flowers to my fiancee there in the valley. Even from as far away as Indiana, I've been able to count on the quality of the product she receives. I make sure after she receives her flowers, I call the shop to thank them for another job well done for putting a smile on her face.",2
"Nice, tasty ""fusion "" type Japanese food. nNice dining room. Visited after Love! nWould have been a five start if not for the hostess. nMade us wait 10 minutes, even though the restaurant wasn't full. nIt was 9 00pm and we had reservations. Hostess made us wait, and seated several parties that came after us. nOur server Po was excellent. Service and food made up for it.",2
"They have great food and the servers and bartenders are always there to help. It's on a college campus so expect the atmosphere. Don't be like that Matthew U guy and talk about how you went in college, then go back and complain about it being a college bar because that's sort of cunty. Try the kitchen sink wing sauce because it's amazing!",2
I loved the place. The atmosphere was great. The staff is friendly. The pizza was great. It can get a little pricey when you order your own pizza and start adding things to it but its well worth it. nI can also say that I ordered a drink at the bar and it was a nice drink. Alot of times I go to restaurants and I hate to order drinks as they are expensive with little alcohol.,2
"I've been to all the Cirque shows in Vegas an felt this was the worst. Best part was the clown that interacted with the audience at the beginning and again toward the middle. Expected a lot better lighting effects etc. Gymnastics were very similar to other shows saw nothing new, interesting or groundbreaking here. For the price of tickets i expected much better from a Cirque performance.",1
"Pretty close to my house, so I tried it out when I first moved to the area. Very unimpressed. Nice ambiance, but the sushi was overpriced and nothing special. I believe they used to have a late night happy hour deal, which would have been cool, but that's gone. I'll be taking my sushi business elsewhere.",1
"Highly recommended if you are in the mood for a casual sandwich in Vegas. I'm in town once a month and I always stop in on every trip. The portions are huge, the prices are great, and the sandwiches are tasty. I usually go with the Cram slam club but have tried a few others without disappointment. The place is usually quiet and very casual.",2
"The food is simple and can be acceptable but not for quality price. The service is relatively slow, so it would be wise to order a small appetizer beforehand. nAs for the atmosphere, they tried to incorporate the open ceiling concept with modern looks. Some might find it nice, some might find it chaotic.",1
"Believe it or not, the best thing about Cestone's is their ice cream, which like Darren said, resembles a mousse in taste and texture. It's really thick and holds up well in the heat. The pizza was pretty good. My burger was a little dry, though. The regulars are ""nebby "" as Pittsburghers say but are nice.",2
"I wasn't familiar with the restaurant since, so I just saw a sign outside that said Gorham Dumplings and I went in thinking it would be asian pot sticker type of dumplings. Which is not what this place is. All you really need is a half order if you don't like spicy foods, just be warned. you can choose your toppings . nNice little find just off state street.",2
"Tasty food, good service, nice view of the strip. I enjoyed my food. I found it to be well prepared. Attentive service. Loud ish and crowded, but, hey, so are true Parisian bistros. I noticed some people considered it touristy, but that's to be expected in Vegas hello. its all tourists.! Its still good food and a cute place to sit on the strip. Give it a try!",2
"Add me to the list of people who have the unfortunate luck of being called by this company on a daily basis. Repeated requests to be removed from their list have been completely ignored. I just filed a complaint with the National Do Not Call Registry, so hopefully that helps. I won't hold my breath, though.",1
I've been to this location lots of times. Shaved I've is really good. I usually get birthday cake a must and strawberry daiquiri and the get the ice cream and cream on top. So good. I've always had good service. It's a snow cone place with high school kids running the joint so they do their best but I haven't had any service issues. I will be back many more times.,2
"Average at best. Eye is off the ball. Average food. Weak service. Too many other better choices. I knew I should have questioned this place as I came from the covered parking section and noticed trash and boxes were left out by the wood pile. I almost didn't go in for that reason, now I regret that I did.",1
"Corporate customers beware! Catering manager was extremely rude and did not live up to what was promised for the event. Convention room was dirty and once we got on the bad side of the catering manager, all staff was very rude and unhelpful. With so many hotels in Vegas, take your business elsewhere!",1
"I came in and asked for a mani pedi, the guy tells me to pick my color and sit in a pedi chair to soak.30 minutes later there are still 3 people ahead of me. I asked the guy how much longer and he estimated another 30 minutes. REALLY?! OMG thanks for letting me know and wasting my time. I had to get up and leave, by then it was 6 30 and too late to go anywhere else. So pissed",1
I went here for a family lunch and was pleasantly pleased. We ordered a pizza half veggie and the other half cheese and I was in Pizza heaven. The service was fantastic and they have beautiful outdoor patio seating. If you haven't been here check them out! Not to mention they have cool beer specials!,2
So I'm getting married in Vegas this October and one of the things I'm looking forward to most with my partner in crime is sharing the joy of these fruckin' pretzels! I am counting the days. Seriously. The plain unsalted pretzel regardless of dipping sauces is so dreamworthy alone. I miss you. I can't wait to see you again.,2
Everytime I have dinner here I am filled with excitement. There's always something new on the menu that will have your tastes buds GO WOW! I love their cheese and charcuterie plates and you can build them yourself or get the chef's choice. You have to come try this plate if you haven't yet. and there's a great bar menu for lighter fare.,2
"The red room and accompanying lounge are very nice spaces, with a darker modern decor, it's a great place to hang out and have a drink, but you should go somewhere else for food. The menu reads nicely but the execution is a bit clumsy, and the service takes years. so grab a couch a libation, and hang out, just dont open that menu",1
"This is my first zipline and it was a good intro. The team Matthew, Matthew and Daniel were great. They were very helpful, kind, fun and having fun. Matthew our leader did well to keep us entertained with his jokes and stories. He threw a bit of history too which was cool. The company is very well organized and pros. The zipline for me wasn't as thrilling as I'd hoped. It felt a bit slow for me.",2
"Good concept, environment and food that do just enough to distinguish itself amongst the many great spots in the area. The burgers are actually a slightly better value then most of the other meaty sandwiches up and down the famed Biltmore burger corridor. They are at a great spot at the base of Camelback Mtn.and I was rather surprised that they haven't done anything to showcase that view.",2
"This is one of the bigger buffets in this part of the metro area and offers a wide selection of standard Chinese buffet dishes, most of which I found to be quite well made. The quality of their of sushi a trick item in most buffets is quite good, as is that of the non standard items they offer, such as Korean kalbi. This is a good place to dine along the western Grand Avenue Rt. 60 corridor.",2
"A really interesting place to visit. Sort of a new take on a pub menu. Nothing heavy but a nice mix of sandwiches, salads, appetizers. Food was excellent, service was great. Nice drink menu with a lot of interesting martinis. Nice wine by the glass. Very moderately priced. A great place to visit if you're in downtown Phoenix. Very casual. We'd definitely go back.",2
"This used to be my favorite but not anymore. I went on July 4th weekday dinner and I was disappointed in the lack of culinary selections. The dessert section is fabulous, atmosphere is great, staff is friendly and attentive. But the food and price aren't worth it anymore. Who knows maybe they were having a bad day but I'm not going to pay 50 to find out again.",1
"LOVE the staff and atmosphere of the store. HATE the food. I don't mind paying 8.00 for a burger and fries, but when the burger is at most maybe a quarter pound of beef with a huge piece of dry lettuce on top and very hard fries, you I think you can get the picture. Its too bad because Im a 50s kind of guy and if it was good I would be here constantly, unfortunately that's not the case.",1
"Got introduced to Indian food here back in 1998. Have sicne become quite an afficianado on it. The ownership has clearly changed hands here. Its run by mostly kids now and its not very authentic tasting Indian at all. The buffet is now one of the worst Indian Buffets in town. If you want a quality indian food experience, try Kebab Palace, The Dhaba or India Gate.",1
"Yikes. 150 for a drink, salad, side and steak. I ordered the American wagyu ribeye and was billed for the Japanese wagyu. No idea which I was served, but regardless it was sub par thin and somewhat dry. I might have complained, but the server at the bar couldn't even keep my water glass filled, so why bother? Not recommended.",1
"I work nearby and head over there for lunch several times a week. They have a grab 'n go area, as well as soups, cold sandwiches, etc. The beer selection my favorite thing is amazing. The entire right side of the back wall is a cold case with hundreds of craft beers and some crap beers like Coors lt, etc . I salivate everytime I go in, looking at all the stuff I want to try Overall, its great!",2
The food was good but way overpriced. Front desk girls were polite but a phony polite like robots repeating what they were told to say. 25 dollars not including tip for a hamburger fries and a drink NOT including tip. You got to be kidding. My experience felt like they were trying to market and package the emperor's new clothes and expect me to buy into it. Be real,1
"I love this barre studio! The reasons why I love it are it's clean, signing up for classes online, knowledgable instructors, the music, the awesome workout and the overall atmosphere. I hope class prices decrease but I also realize they are a brand new studio trying to get on their feet. I would definitely recommend to anyone as I go there at least once a week!",2
"Honestly, the best thing about Gordon Biersch is sitting on the balcony to watch the sunset. Beautiful view. The beers are overpriced, but tasty. The food is quite honestly, meh. Nothing memorable except for the garlic fries. The service each time I have visited has been terrible. Inattentive servers, empty glasses, empty plates. Go for the view and a beer and then go elsewhere for dinner.",1
"Incredible food, unbelievably perfect customer service. was brought here with some good friends from work. absolutely the only option if you want not just good chinese food but an experience with employee's who remember everything you like for the next visit in. my first visit was great, my second visit sold me.",2
We had a special ravioli which was very good but unfortunately I don't remember what it was called and the chicken rigatoni dish. Both were great. I liked the chicken rigatoni dish much better as it had a nice kick to it and had a wide variety of components to it. The garlic bread they bring out is also amazing. I just wish they served some hard liquor too wine and beer only ,2
Food was ok here but there are other breakfast places around that are better. Our server sucked. We had Jamie. She walked by our table 5 times sense we got our food and didn't stop to ask how it was and then another 4 times when we were trying to pay. It took more time waiting for this then it took them to cook our meal or us to eat it.,1
"I ordered a hot chocolate with a scoop of ice cream, but rather than getting a hot chocolate, I got a cold chocolate. Yes, the ice cream would have cooled it down, but the hot chocolate should still be hot! It's like the hot chocolate was just sitting around before they added the ice cream and served it. The chocolate flavour was also not very good. Tasted like cheap chocolate. Skip this place.",1
"My husband and I thought we'd be able to have a nice little dinner at a Mexican restaurant, but it turns out it's party central. We saw girls walking in with slutty dresses and heels, and saw people in the back partying. If that's your thing, go for it. Looking for douchebag central instead of a restaurant? Drink away. This is for you.",1
"Bubble tease is one of those things you just have to try. nIt's exceedingly popular amongst students here. And for good reason. The places' atmosphere is thrifty, with random furniture. It has somewhat of a hippie feel to it. But somehow it works. Bubble Tease has a very high novelty factor, and is definitely fun to chill out for a bit with some friends.",1
"The first time I had Cupcakery was about 3 years ago, and it was AWESOME. So good that I was willing to drive across town to have one. However, recent trips the most recent being last week have proven that the cupcakes here are on the decline. The red velvet was dry and over frosted. The strawberry shortcake was no different. With so many cupcake bakeries in town, I'm sad to say we won't be back.",1
"Dear Yelpers, I have many fond memories in the waffle houses around our dear valley. Why? because I went to college, and I wasn't always under the influence of strictly oxygen if you know what I mean. The place is what it is. Hightened sensory perception makes it ""burn a little brighter "" perhaps , but its A FRIGGIN WAFFLE HOUSE! Most Sincerely, nDr. Obvious.",1
"This hipster wine, salad and sandwich shop is in the former Press space, and everyone I met in Charlotte still refers to it as Press. Food and drinks are inexpensive and delicious and they also have a great assortment of microbrewery bottled beers. Threes is an excellent lunch choice, whether you're eating in or taking out.",2
We just moved to Anthem and Affinito's was our first stop. The food was very good and the service was excellent. We went back a second time for the pizza. It was good but we are New Yorkers and once you get outside the city it is hard to find any pizza that compares. We will go back as it is the best AZ pizza we have had so far.,2
"Showed up at 1 45 on a Sunday they close at 3pm and was turned away by the hostess with a poorly explained ""we're not seating any more for the rest of the day "" something to the effect of them taking a lot of reservations and being unable to accommodate walk ins. The restaurant was half empty. I guess their spoons are even smaller than they advertise.",1
"After a day traveling around Edinburgh, Wings was the perfect snack to fill my American wing loving desires. Good atmosphere. They had a movie marathon going on downstairs. Service was pretty good too. I had a magner's and dancing in the bleu flame hot bleu cheese ! I'll be coming back sooner rather than later! ",2
So disappointed. The last time when it was pretty new it was good. This visit was horrible. Carne Asada was overcooked and looked disgusting. The waiters seem uninterested in helping and only made the occasional pass by. The place was deserted. Management needs to get their act together and bring this place back to life.,1
"If i could submit no stars i would. First, the red headed or pink haired bartender needs to check herself. She showed no hospitality and failed to make an old fashioned cocktail. Barely any whiskey and served in a dirty soda glass. Also while i was trying to enjoy my terribly made drink i could overhear her speaking rudely about me to her coworkers. Girl needs to go.",1
"I don't normally do fast food hamburger places. I haven't had a big mac since 1994! So when a place offers air baked fries.I am ALL OVER it. I've been here twice and if I lived closer to this place, I would definitely come here at least 3 times a month. I miss a lot of the ""health type "" restaurants NYC offers like The Pump and although this menu isn't as good, I'll take what I can get.",2
A very nice and clean hotel. The pool area is truly the highlight of the hotel with a wave pool and a lazy river. It's like a water park. They also have great refillable drink specials at the pool. You almost never need to leave because the hotel has so many resturant clubs and lounges. Everything vegas is about in one place.,2
"Extremely mediocre. I got the chicken Parmesan sandwich that came with fries. Chicken was poorly seasoned fries had that freezer dried texture. I could only choke down about a quarter of this absolutely abysmal food. All in all, if you want to blow an evening out along with about 20 bucks per entree , this is your place.",1
"Love the Mirage! "" Other than a mysterious unexpected 9 room service delivery fee above the 100 we paid for cold eggs benny,toast and potatoes Including 20 tip in cash ,Or this review would have been 5 solid stars, everything was superb! Great room, polite housekeeping staff, wonderful restaurants! Pool was spectacular as always. Pristine property. Thanks Mirage!",2
"Ok I realise I'm not a ""regular "" nor am I a student packing a laptop to tweet and FB all day but for the staff to pretend I'm just not there ain't cool! Serving stale crappy coffee with plenty of bad attitude ain't cool either! Will avoid this place at all costs in future, will not recommend it to anyone either.",1
"This place is convenient and cheap which is good, but the music is always too loud. We can't even have a decent conversation over our meal. We usually have good service but today our service sucked. We didn't once get checked on and my friends food came last minute. He was waiting forever for a salad. Not the best but okay for a late night bite.",1
Very POOR service. One person in the party got grilled cheese and the cheese wasn't even melted. Waitress seemed out of it and didn't care AT ALL. Ordered a medium well cowboy burger. It was RAW! Wasn't the first time food has gone back here and the fact that 2 out 3 orders in one sitting went back was ridiculous. It wasn't even a crowded night.,1
"I had visited the Tempe location before and thought I'd give this one a shot. I ordered the chicken souvlaki pita with a Greek salad. The chicken was hot and juicy, and the salad was also great. Kinda higher priced than I expected at 10, but the food was quality and the service was good. Not sure why it has a 3 star average, ill def be coming back.",2
"I've stayed at the Palms a dozen times and the only thing that brings me down is that they won't upgrade me to the Heffner Suite! I have only great things to say about the Palms.love the big rooms, the bathroom goodies from Aveda.the coffee shop! It's a great experience all the way around.try the sushi bar.amazing!",2
"This place is excellent! Fun atmosphere, great wine list and incredible food! The one thing I always order to start out with is the bruschetta, it's the best I've had anywhere. The braised pork ribs are also excellent and if the duck confit crepes are on the menu, you MUST order them. I've been here three times and each time was a 5 star experience!",2
"Really Good American Chinese, maybe the best I've had in town thus far. Exceptionally fresh and not at all greasy. We split a tofu and vegtable stir fry that was spot on and an egg foo young that was loaded with fresh veggies and cooked to perfection. The price, service and ambience were all good, as was the fresh food.",2
"The staff was friendly. That's about the only thing that was good about this place. The frozen yogurt was not good. The people working there also didn't know what active cultures were. There was also hardly any seating inside the place. We will not be returning, especially since there are so many other great frozen yogurt places in Scottsdale.",1
"The burritos are great, and very filling! I manage to make it there once a week or so, the food is great, even if I become partially immobile for a short time after eating there. I swear the rice expands once it hits the stomach! Make sure you come hungry. If I am going for lunch I've been known to take the ""Chipotle fast "" and eat little to no breakfast so I can just finish my meal!",2
"Loved the BBQ aroma menu. The steak, brisket sandwich ""death by chocolate "" dessert were equally great! Service was awesome, too. This was our first trip, but won't be our last. It's a nice place, with a non chain atmosphere. It was nice to have sports on TV, but not the overwhelming, ear piercing noise that makes a conversation difficult.",2
"Great place, nice to have a little local bar in the neighborhood that instantly fits in with the local flavor. I have been there many times already in just the short time they have been open. The, staff are all very attentive and friendly. The food is good and averagly priced. A great little place to stop by after work.",2
"Good sushi, very nice staff, amazing prices. They give crunchy wonton strips while you wait and they are just really friendly. The sushi is where it's at.we always order way too much and i just can't stop eating it.so good. I'm sure there are other places with better choices, etc, but none match the overall joy i get from coming here. Just a good place all around.",2
i remember visiting this hotel when i was kid in the early 70's after dove hunting in maricopa with my dad and uncles. i was amazed that there was a bat shaped pool with a ball shaped jacuzzi. way cool. i must take my daughter there to see it again for me someday. i will have to revisit and give my review i'm giving it 4 stars from my childhood memory of the pool,2
Just moved into the area and have stopped here twice for quick meal. Both times I ordered a Mexican pizza and 2 tacos. THe shells seemed stale and the food was just tossed together and it looked like there was anything on the pizza. Nothing like all my other experiences at other taco bells. Not likely to come to see if the 3rd times the charm,1
"Nice looking place but service was slow, food was just above average and I left feeling hungry. We ordered the platter for five which seemed horribly inadequate for five guys, even after apps. Their house cocktails tasted like scented water but the sidecar I ordered was okay. I did tell them exactly how to make it though. I won't go back.",1
"Impressive wine list, but the service was a little apathetic, and very high prices for the quality of food. Food was lukewarm when it arrived and the ""menu description "" to ""product "" ratio was pretty far off. I essentially had a BBQ sauced ham hock over far too buttery grits. But I will say that the wild board meatballs were awesome. I think I just expected more.",1
Love this cute little coffee shop near McGill. It also means you will have no problem with English and nobody would think of you differently if you don't speak French. Hooray. They use Westcoast beans and the familiar 49th parallel is brewed here among other roasters in the coast. It's so cute and fun to just people watch while seated on a stool. Fairly small seating area though.,2
"Little Darlings is such a scam they said dances were top less? No they aren't topless they show you a nip from far away and if u try to get closer they call a bouncer then they kick u out like a dog after you pay 20 cover and 350 private rooms are shit, I got this girls they were snooty and they just ordered drinks on our tab and they didn't even dance. Such a scam they're dirty they stink",1
"We had their special Tomahawk steak 98, Glazed Sea Bass 39, sides with asparagus 14, and hand cut fries 12. We don't eat our food bland, in fact slightly on the salty side, but all the food here was just a bit too salty. It will definitely spike your blood pressure. The best part of this experience was the ambiance. Definitely chic and their bathroom is really different.",1
"We used Daryn to pick up and delivery a 5 large box dining room set from Costco. He called used the night before to confirm our meeting time at Costco and was promptly there as promised. For a reasonable extra fee, he and his team unboxed and assembled the furniture. I recommend using Small Move Specialists for delivering those large Costco items you can't get home on your own.",2
Dive bar.you betcha. Cafe lights string on the ceiling and their 24 beers. well it seemed like they were out of half of them. Not good for a holiday weekend. No food was being served but we were offered BBQ that was sitting out for an event they just had. Really was expecting more we'll see how much better they are after they go on the air Sept 8th.,1
Awesome lemonade and the pork taco was delicous. Also had the carne asada and chicken tacos which were also good but pork was my favorite. The kids got the cheese crisp with the works it was huge and really good! Hubby got tacos too and liked them! We will be back. I REALLY liked the lemonade and all the different flavors And the service was great too! Everyone working there was really friendly!,2
"I am signing up for Yelp just so that I may review Hansen's. I have a complicated plumbing leak which has required several consultants Eric came to help within two hours of my phone call, gave me the part I need, and did not charge anything! This is on a Friday afternoon in the summer heat. I could not be more grateful and will be using and referring to Hansen's for as long as I am in Arizona!",2
"Great branch, usually really nice inside. Occasional bum strolls in and smells up the place a little. But it is on Las Vegas Blvd so what should you expect. Staff is very nice and kinda knowledgable, although I've had a couple times where they acted like they knew something when they didn't. I'm sure that's the exceptioot the rule though. Nice branch overall.",2
"UPDATE THIS BUFFET HAS TEMPORARILY CLOSED! http vegas.eater.com 2014 11 10 7189237 and now for the first shutter at sls las vegas SLS president Scott Kreeger said the second floor location ""is doing OK, but not hitting out of the park "" as compared to the other hotel casinos restaurants. No doubt! Have any of these wizards even been to a competitor's buffet to see where they went so wrong?",1
Ranias can provide a pleasant dining experience through attentive service and very good food. Their lightly spiced tea is pleasant and neutral. Their fresh naan smells and tastess wonderful. Spinach rice with braised lamb shank was highly pleasing.Had the baklava been equal to everything else I would have offered five rather than four stars.,2
"Coming from NJ where Cuban restaurants are aplenty, my expectations of quality authentic Cuban food are high. I am pleasantly surprised to find this restaurant meets my expectations. The food was delicious and the atmosphere supported the authenticity of the food. I am looking forward to becoming a regular.",2
"I used to like coming to this car wash because it was the only one near me. Now, their car wash prices are a lot higher for lousy cleaning. Also, when you first pull up to select your car wash, I feel as if I'm at a used car sales lot. The employees are incredibly pushy to upsell you on a simple car wash. I can't say I will be returning anytime soon.",1
Worst climbing gym I have ever been to. Customer service was a joke. Wall appears as if a boy scout went ham with a few sheets of plywood back in the 80s and then did nothing since then. Holds are prehistoric and grimy. Setting is subpar. Insurance doesn't allow for people who can't belay to be belayed? Better off climbing the outside of the building for a good pump.,1
This place was a pleasant surprise. Great selection of rolls and the Heart Attack appetizer may be the best appetizer in town. They have a bunch of new twists on old favorites and their Mexican roll is great. Also very impressed that they use a lot of halibut. Service is alright but they have great sake bomb prices to help you forget.,2
"This is my favorite Thai place anywhere. I have had Thai food in many big cities, and this place is on top for me. I love the basil rolls, Tom yum soup, and the pad kaprow and pad prik. Their spice levels vary from mild to double Thai hot. The service is always great, and the food comes out very quickly. nIf you like Thai you have to give this place a try.",2
Great sandwiches. I go there for breakfast a lot. Their breakfast combination is very great deal. The coffee is very strong and it will keep you buzzed all day. The pork bun is light and tasty. My only Grief is they don't want to put ketchup in my sandwich. They always give me the packet and it gets messy.,2
"I am a long time fan of Olive Garden's minestrone soup and salads! The wait staff was superb and the food was great! I noticed there were several new items on the menu, but couldn't resist sticking with the familiar. n I decided to eat at this establishment on last time before they close in two weeks and relocating to Monroe.",2
"Horrible. I expected the type of food we ate here at state line, or any other of the lower end casinos. Did I say horrible yet? So bad that we vowed to avoid the Monte Carlo Hotel totally from any future visits to Las Vegas. We paid over 60 for dinner for 2, wasted money. Food shitty Service shitty Seating process is ridiculous, AVOID THIS PLACE. There is much better eating on and off the strip.",1
"Very nice place, I brought my wife here for our anniversary and was not disappointing. The sommelier was fantastic offering great wine pairings, the waiter took great care of us and the food was delicious. I'd really like to go back during the summer as they have a nice open area in back with a man made pond. I highly recommend going here.",2
From Chicago this was the farthest thing from it. The beef was just shredded in juice. Had no real taste. Bread was blah and giardinera was super week. Pittsburghers don't know the difference unless they have gotten real beef in Chicago before. This was not it. Won't be going back. Should be called shredded roast beef sandwich. Guy that served it was nice though.,1
"Service was horrible. 1 2 hr after being seated we were still looking for our waiter. Then it took an hour before the food arrived. I had the Chili Colorado. Bad. Wrong cut of meat was used, and it was improperly prepared and then served in what tasted like cheap canned enchilada sauce. Even the margarita didn't come as requested. I won't be back.",1
"Java java java coffee coffee coffee. This is my morning coffee stop. The staff is always friendly and they are always there to help. They share a lot with a tire shop which is convenient. Gas for a decent price and snacks for the road warriors. What else do you need? Near a bus stop, McDowell westbound.",2
Margaritaville is what I would categorize as one and done. Meaning I have only gone there once and would never return. The bartender got into a screaming match with a customer not cool and it made me feel very uncomfortable. The bathrooms are disgusting and every surface in the entire bar seemed to be covered in some sort of sugary slime. Margaritaville needs a hose down.,1
"If you live or are visiting Vegas this is a must! The food was amazing and well priced. I was dining with a Vegan and though I don't typically eat vegetarian or Vegan the food was amazing and I couldn't tell the difference. Bold flavors, a foodie paradise! We had the vegan tasting menu all was really good, except the desert, some things just can't be vegan sorry lol",2
" nwow. this is sucks! Yes! I don't order BBQ, which means I can't have my ' traditional special home made Korean dishes '?! sigh. SERVICES here SUCKS! The couple after me did even got their BBQ before my REGULAR bibimbap drinks appetizers! unfair. Also, one more thing got to mention to Yelpers the prices are expensive! Pretty much 2 more than other Korean restaurant compare to Mr. Tofu ",1
"Chicken Tinga Braised Beef Tacos were awesome,hands down! nSalsa charred habanero was hot but delicious! If you can't handle the heat, get the pico gringo. nStaff was attentive. nA little pricey but worth the extra . Doesn't pay to waste your money for lower priced mexican food. nArchitecturally, their building is very modern and unique and clean. nWould go again and again.",2
"Am I allowed to give negative stars? This place has horrible service. I was waitingg for fifteen minutes before anyone acknowledged me. When someone finally told me to go sit on one of the pedicure chairs, I was left there for 20 minutes. No one even turned on the water so my feet could soak. I'm never returning to this place.",1
"This place used to be good. The food quality has gone down big, no taste at all. We ordered crawfish and shrimp, both had a very bland taste and it was supposed to be the hot n juicy special medium. The staff that night acted like they didn't like their jobs. That visit may have been my last as the Boiling Crab is the other option. Hot n Juicy needs to step up their game.",1
"Very dissapointed with this place. We reserved there banquet room for a baby shower. Contract was signed banquet room paid for, we sent out our invitations. A week before baby shower they call to notify us that they had double booked there banquet room. They caused alot of trouble stress for us. Turns out this not the first time they do this.",1
"Ok foodies' don't judge me to harshly. Had to meet a coworker for a quick meeting. This store it clean, well run and filled with high profile biz folks in a hurry. While the chain is improving the their reputation globally as possible this store showcases that a fast food chain can deliver in a pinch. Great job.",2
"I have to say that I was impressed with the amount of food served. The chili dog is gianormous and the frozen hot chocolate is worth the wait. About the wait, it did take awhile to get seated and the food was a little slow. But in their defense, it was a Friday night and packed. I would definitely recommend this to my friends!",2
Amazing every time and all the time. This time I was their last customer of the night. Most places will treat you terribly when you are there at closing but not these guys. They always greet you with a smile and the place is amazingly clean. Peanuts to get you started and the soda machine has about a thousand different choices.,2
"I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed. I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed. The waitress was not very friendly, the hasbrowns were soaked in butter, if you love butter you will love it. The coffee and homemade jam were both good. None of the wait staff seemed happy to be there. They really needed someone at the door directing people.",1
"Will never play here again! The course is junkie, run down overbooked. Takes forever to finished a game. Not the greatest food the staff is not very friendly or accommodating. There are other golf courses out there who runs specials w nicer course, food staff. Greenfield Lakes Golf nKokopelli Golf nTrilogy Golf DONT GO HERE!",1
"The house beans and bread alone are worth a visit. My favorite items on the menu are the burrata, bruschetta, the fresca salad with gorgonzola honey dressing, the Sorrento pasta with shrimp and pink alfredo sauce, and the Amatriciana pasta just a touch spicy . Great date night ambiance inside, and the patio area offers a casual option too.",2
"OK decor, CenPho location and decent ice cream. That pretty much wraps up my feelings except for exceedingly slooooooow service. In defense of the counter staff, there's only been one person working every time I've gone and I'm inevitably behind a large group ordering multiple sundays. I'm probably better off going to AJs or Fresh Easy for gelato.",1
"This is not the best buffet on the strip, but it's also not that bad. There really isn't anything special about it other than affordability, a short wait time, and attentive waitresses. The food is so so. There is not an elaborate spread. The sweets section is only average. I'd say go here for breakfast rather than lunch, because it's hard to mess up eggs and sausage.",1
"If you like burnt bread with very little toppings, this is a great place. I thought it was a waste of money. I have had frozen grocery pizzas better. Also, guy who parked my car moved it as it was in a different place than where he first put it. Of the 100 200 pizza places i have gone to in my life, this one would be top 10 worst.",1
"Lonnng wait! Was estimated to wait an hour and now still waiting, and it's been already been over two! An hour in, I followed up on the job, and they said they were still waiting for the parts from the dealer which isn't too far from the shop. A heads up from the shop would've beeice, versus having me wait for hours on end. Disappointed. So it goes.",1
"You'll find a diverse array of people dining here. This Merry Ann's isn't nearly as pretty as its newer sister location, but the food is the same. Sometimes you'll see students studying here. It's a 24 hour place, and there's one of those ""use the claw to grab a stuffed animal "" machines in the back if you're interested.",2
"9 Dragons Kung Fu is a second home for me. When I moved back to the Valley, I examined many martial arts schools across many different martial systems before finding this school. 9 Dragons embodies positive principles that will help anyone achieve their individual goals. Sifu and Simu Kaneen are truly some of the highest caliber instructors I could have the pleasure of training under.",2
"with a name like Fat Burrito, I had really high expectations. I'm not sure how this place exists. I couldn't even finish my carne asada burrito because it was so bad and I usually can put down anything. its a poor bootleg version of chipotle, assembly style.but its terrible. I don't recommend this place unless you want to taste a terrible burrito.",1
"Completely insane. That's the only way I can explain this place. It's expensive.when I went for dinner it was around 35 per person. But believe me, this place is worth it. The selection was great, quality of food outstanding, and more desserts than you'll ever know what to do with. Don't let the price turn you off, if you go to one buffet in Vegas check this one out!",2
"NOTHING chases away a Vegas morning hangover like their Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich. It's a little pricey, but the sandwich is huge and comes with fries. I can't leave Vegas without stopping here a least once. I've tried some of the other locations along the Strip, but the Luxor location is just better. Oh yea, they also offer a pretty decent quick breakfast too.",2
"I shop at Walgreens all the time with my big family! For the most part they are inexpensive. They will match prices on most things and they now have a new program where we earn points so we get money taken off our bill. Since I shop there a lot, I usually get around 5.00 taken off my bill, and I still get the clearence prices as well!",2
"Went all out for this meal. A5 Kobe beef, just wow. Melt in your mouth heaven. For sides we had Brussels sprouts, asparagus, Mac n cheese and creamed spinach. All very good. Dessert can't go wrong with English toffee caramel cake and brown butter ice cream. Overall amazing! Gordon steak 2 2! Great Job!",2
"Located outside the front of the Fashion Show Mall, the entire restaurant is outside. It is a great place to do some people watching. 10 burgers does not include fries. Limited selection on the menu. The burgers are excellent. The shakes are very good but pricey. We also had the cheddar fries, which were very good, too.",2
"Fear not Sweet Tomatoes fans. I just received an email from saying they have ""heard my feedback "" and are changing it back to the way it was ""sweeter than ever "". I guess the 2.5 stars it received was enough to give it a second thought and pull the plug. I think if they went ahead and converted all the restaurants to Field Kitchen it would have bankrupted the company. Good riddens.",1
"The food is good, but the owner who is involved most displays horrible customer service and yells at his employees constantly. They also pay late, as well as bounce checks and underpay. They owe me 800 in payroll currently. Awesome business ethics. nIf you do eat there, try the chili and the Fresh Catch salad w shrimp.",1
"If a haircut place messes up a ""buzz, "" it's a bad haircut place. Received a very asymmetrical number 2 haircut, really disappointed. I know Great Clips isn't the gold standard, but this one in particular is really bad and a couple dollars more expensive than other locations 15 for a mediocre haircut. You're better off going somewhere else, my lesson is learned.",1
Was very disappointed with this location. Have been to several others of theirs and this one does not compare. Server was very nice but food was very below par. We ordered the wings but they were very small and bland. Sandwich was extremely small and dry. Tried to order dessert but they were out of bananas.,1
"For the price it is not worth it! The turkey burger was like a hockey puck! And the fries were average, 14 for a drink and 17.5 dollar for an ""aged "" burger that was okay but not worth 17.5 dollars! Stick with one of the other wonderful restaurants in the cosmopolitan Comme' Ca was awesome or China Poblano right next door was delish!",1
"I never had a problem here. I come in, order, wait, and leave. I normally do take out but when I dine in everything is fine too. Sad to see it doesn't have good reviews. I always order the chicken katsu curry. I tell them to put curry on the side because I don't like how they put it all over the chicken. It becomes soggy.",2
"I was already a couple beers in and just stopped by for some half price wings, so I don't know if I can give a proper review, but will try. This place obviously used to be a midtown sundries, it still felt like it. There were good beer specials and half priced wings, what else do you need? Nothing special but a great change of pace to that mostly over priced side of town.",2
"I've been waiting in the will call line for over an hour. The staff is just silly emo hipsters who don't seem to care about their patrons. Get shit organized. I could stand this when I was 16, but there are some people who have expectations of a music venue. Plus my ass is sweaty. Which makes me angry.",1
"DO NOT EAT HERE Bad food, high prices, incompetence abounding. They cut corners on food, they treat their employees terribly, and their is no atmosphere, unless you count the air smelling like a more depressing opium den.please stop going here so they can close down faster. Would have picked zero stars if that was an option. One is four too many.",1
"Pretty damned good vegan and vegetarian food for not a whole lot of green. Courteous and attentive staff. Solid music choices at an acceptable volume level. Kind of limited menu, but hey they've also got cruelty free pies. Space is also limited, but that just makes it easier for me to get work done while I wait for the delectables to arrive at the table.",2
Was I there on a bad day or what? I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold. They have 15 items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them. Gross and bland. I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!,1
"Really solid breakfast food, perfect for the morning after a fuight. Hearty fare and fresh ingredients, served efficiently with a smile. Lots of standard choices, prepared well. From the moment you walk in the door, it's pleasant, efficient service. The place is huge, so I've never had to wait long and it was great whether there were two or six in my party.",2
"I've tried pilates at a few other places, but after 1 lesson with Melissa I was hooked! She is a great motivator and super knowledgeable. She makes an effort to really get to know her clients so she can help you reach your goals. Plus, she is hilarious and entertaining. The studio is immaculate as well. The service you receive here will not let you down!",2
"I've never really favored Target but after the experience I had there, I will never, ever shop at this Target again! I returned a Print Master Disk set with the receipt. The associate made me feel as if I had stolen it because it had been longer than 60 days. I asked for a manager and the manager was insensitive and obtuse and had an attitude similar to the associate.",1
"Great location to get to, good service and very prompt with the food. Love the smash fries, bbq bacon burger with fried egg is delish. Try the oreo shake which is always a winner. The truffle mushroom burger is also a great choice. This is above the i out burgers and is as good as the expensive gourmet burgers at half the price. Place is very clean and friendly.",2
OMG this please is not even worth it The room smelled like smoke so bad and just think we paid in advance for 5 day's and i was pissed then once we checked in they informed us we had to pay a another fee of 10 a day surcharge I was so done with this hotel and was ready to check out as soon as i saw the room Do Not go in the pool it was so dirty you could see it from the side walk GOOD LUCK,1
"My buddy and I just ate lunch up at the bar. This was my second time in and this was the way to go. The food came quickly, the toasted subs were amazing and the beautiful young ladies that were bar tending welcomed us and made us feel right at home. I'll definitely be back soon to take my seat at the bar. Thanks!",2
"the owners were very nice. the pizza crust was nice and a bit crispy which is the way i like it. i had the pepperoni, cheese, chicken, and veggie pizza all good and do able.yes its buffet but this is no cici's quality thank goodness. i have been craving a buffet pizza joint here in uptown and found this gem. they also have cherrywine on tap! i will def be back.",2
Great breakfast spot! Right in the heart of old town scottsdale on scottsdale rd. So it's great to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather and scenery of old town. The waitresses are all very easy on the eyes. I usually go with the French toast and a mimosa or the omelette. Never been disappointed in any trip down there. Open 7 days a week so it's good spot any day.,2
"Ugggghh, I travel quite a bit and this airport is annoying as hell to get out of. There is no issue arriving there but people and workers are annoying. I couldn't wait to get on the plane and get the hell out of there. The layout is annoying and the food selection was the worst I've experienced at an airport.",1
"My girlfriend and I always try to have dinner at Mix in Las Vegas when we visit. Besides the great view, the restaurant has excellent food and is usually pretty quite so you can enjoy a nice meal without all the Vegas ""characters. "" Every time we've been there the menu has had unique entrees. There is always a few great fish dishes and other adventurous creations. A great place for a date night.",2
"I usually am very satisfied everytime i come here. However this time around, i brought my baby and in laws and the service was so dang slow and horrible. Im waiting with my baby for a good hr to get our food. We ask what is wrong and they say that they are understaffed. Everyone around us is getting their food except us. Horrible service",1
"There's a local feel here. I wish I lived closer to it, it's kind of far from everything but worth the drive. The coffee is perfect every time and they bring in local baked good. The staff is great, except one but perhaps she was having an extremely bad day. Can't wait to get more coffee now that I've moved to town!",2
"Veggie un wich with hot peppers and sprouts is what this girl is about although they are a little too generous with the sprouts ! Delivery and ordering in, staff is always friendly, accommodating, and speedy. I mean it's a sandwich shop my expectations include making sandwich that doesn't take 15 minutes. THEY WORK REALLY HARD BY THE WAY! Great Job guys and gals!",2
"My parents have been going to ProCare for about 3 years now after a mishap with another Vegas Doctor. This office is clean, quick and friendly with service. I came in for a physical and was advised on what needed to be done, blood was drawn quickly and Dr. Tran is great! I'm sad to see not many doctors' offices are reviewed on Yelp, but hope that'll change soon. ",2
The owner is absolutely fantastic! I came in the night before my wedding this past week. The spray tan worked wonders. Just like he recommended I had an even and light glow that was perfect for the big day and the days following. I felt completely comfortable and relaxed. Thank you SOOOO much! Don't go anywhere else!,2
"The best bar that I ended up at in Vegas! The dueling pianists sing songs on request, with tips of course. Everyone in the bar is singing songs together! Great atmosphere! Great crowds! Even though I did not stay long, this is one place I will definitely be coming back to. Singing songs when drunk is fun!",2
"LAME, lame, lame! I had expected a REAL cafe, but it was just one of those kiosk type stores kinda like Mrs Field's Cookies in your typical mall where you can purchase the items but there wasn't any place to sit. Why do you call it a cafe when there is no place to sit? Why not just call it Nestle Tollhouse?",1
"I made it a point to visit this restaurant during my trip to Phoenix. Being from Manhattan, I am spoiled with exquisite restaurants to select from. This was by far a true gem of a fine eatery. The scallops were cooked to perfection with truly creative flavors. The ambiance is chic, cozy and elegant.",2
"I live in North Scottsdale and it's worth driving all the way down here. Dr Oswald is excellent, as is the whole staff. Scheduling billing and everything else is a breeze. They've taken care of some things that my previous dentists have let slide. I've gotten a couple of onlays and filling replacements that are working out much better. Highly recommended!",2
"If this restaurant was closer to my house , i would come here more offten , the portions are huge. jus the way i like it. I had the chorizo omelet with chedder. I skipped the potato and had a side of tomato instead dam diet. I had the potatos before and they are great ,cut a little thicker then chips. The country fried steak looked good, i think i might try that next time. Service was very good.",2
"I absolutely love Sushi Twisters AYCE menu! Everything is high quality from the soups to desserts. They have a great selection of all types of nigiri, rolls, soups, appetizers, etc. The baked mussels and baked scallops are absolutely amazing! I always regret eating sushi anywhere else as nothing compares!",2
"Fun lunch on the way home from Phoenix Sky Harbor. Great place for a really good sandwich and craft beer. Loved the decor and feel of the place. The ambience made me feel like i was back in Seattle without the rain, grey skies and a restaurant full of black fleece jackets. I'm not a huge fan of ordering at a counter . my only complaint.",2
"In the two times we've ordered from this place, we requested the pizza to be cut in slices and not those little squares. They never did what we asked, even when the receipt had our request on it. It really gives the impression that they don't care. The pizza itself was good, but would be better if it weren't cut into squares.",1
"Being from Texas i had to check out it out and i'm glad i did! awesome buffet for 8 and that includes your drink.kind of a quiet hotel but it is about 5 10mins north of the old strip.plenty of tables and slots,actually did pretty good on video poker,walked away with 90 after starting out with only 20",2
"I used to go all the time when I was in HS and last trip I noticed some change over of the stores from what I remember. The food court has okay variety, but not a whole lot. I think that the management company neglected this place for too long, it definitely needs its facelift. It's great for its convenience if you need to pick something up real quick but I wouldn't be spending all day there.",1
"PAYMORE. Just like all the other reviews. I was swindled. I returned the car 95 full on gas, they then decided to charge me 29 for additional gas. Oh and I love when they say it's only 200 for the week. Get back and random fees equal up to 430 . How are these people still open? I want to call the Better Business Bureau",1
"came in after some gambling. got seats at the bar and had a good time with my bf. the bartender is super nice, recommended a few really good drinks one is pear base martini, another is grape martini. YUM! He also recommended a few places for us to go to as LAVO isn't open on Thursday night for dancing. score!",2
"I've been here a few times now. There's a good selection of scrubs, and always plenty of staff to help. The people are friendly, and the store is clean, if cluttered. They also sell shoes and some medical supplies stethoscopes, badge holders, etc. It's a good place to go if you need scrubs another medical supplies.",2
"Stopped here on 5 12 13 for our last meal in Vegas. Great burgers as always a little disorganized here and that's why I dinged them one star our party had tickets 28, 29, 30, 31. How can they serve ticket 33 before us? It's all burgers, so it's not like our orders were complicated! Other than that, all good.",2
"Valet parking is 5 starting at 4 pm. Arrived at 4 05 pm. The waitress offered to have my valet ticket validated. I didn't ask, she offered. But when I went to pick up my car, the valet attendant wouldn't honor it. WTF. There are too many places with a much better Happy Hour menu in Old Town for this kind of customer service.",1
This is great option for fast food much healthier than a burger standard. The drive through is quick and easy and the service is great. Their creamy cilantro dressing is amazing as well as their avocado salsa which I like to put on everything. This location is consistent and that will make us return.,2
"Really great Thai food, nice green papaya salad and the way they make their tofu dishes is super, I don't know if it is the crinkle cut they use on the tofu, or some other cooking technique, but it was exceptional. The veggies were cooked perfectly, not too crisp not too mushy and the spice level was just right.",2
"Let me start out by saying I'm a huge fan of Mario Batali and Babbo is still one of the best meals of my life. That said, my wife and I were excited to go to B B when we were out in Vegas. It was a huge let down. The service was inattentive and the pastas were like a salt lick and virtually inedible. There are many other better choices for your Vegas vacation. Avoid.",1
"Nice atmosphere and delicious Italian food. Fellow yelper Dorothy C. Brought me here during my Arizona trip. We shared a bruschetta plank as an appetizer loved the prosciutto fig, ricotta honey, and fresh mozzarella basil and also the truffled mushroom pizza. Our waitress recommended the house made special blackberry lemon cello which was unnecessarily strong and disappointing in terms of flavor.",2
"Best vegetarian cuisine in Phoenix, easily. It has a cool, artsy environment with a nice vibe. The service is pretty fast and it's not too expensive, considering the amazing delicious quality of the food. I'd say the average meal costs 12 to 15, including drinks and the almost mandatory order of crab puffs they're that good . om nom nom nom",2
"Description Run downed. After watching O and Le Reve a couple years ago I figured let's watch KA, since it was a staple of MGM and close to Aria. The performers dropped their weapons, the special effects were outdated. After doing a Wiki on KA, the show is 5 years old no wonder. The only cool part is the inverted stage. And the soothing music.",1
"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the valley that I have been to so far. I like the Chicken Korma and Vindaloo. I have been here several times and it is consistent and good. the bad they charge for rice. On the whole, it's on the expensive side, maybe I should go for the buffet but I'm generally not a fan of buffets.",2
"I love this health club! I wish I lived closer as it's the nicest Village in AZ. There are so many great machines that can work just about anything and so much room so you aren't waiting to use a particular machine or elliptical. It feels like ""home "" being there and everyone is so friendly. Just like being around people you care about every single day.",2
"Welcome to the worse buffet in Vegas, at least this morning! Everything was cold! The bacon, the eggs, the hash, the ham, etc. I kept going back to grab something else and the new plate was as cold as the first. This was at 7am when they opened, so maybe other times are better, but it is just not worth the risk with the many other good places.",1
"I am only giving these guys 4 stars because I don't really have much to compare to. I have never had a Po Boy before I had it from Flavors of Louisiana, but I absolutely LOVE them now. I got the Chicken Po boy and everything from the bread to the sauce to the chicken is great! Oh and fried green tomatoes are THE BEST! OH Oh ohhhhh, don't forget to get some sweet tea too! I love this place. Enjoy!",2
Nice place to go eat if you want some southern food cooking. The chicke dumplings were awesome. Yum to the squash casserole too! Mac n cheese is fab. People sitting around me were getting the cajun meatloaf and I may just try that the next time. Overall this is great place for southern comfort food!,2
I love Flame Broiler. But this one is a bit harder to enjoy. Food was not as good as I usually get. But my biggest beef was the music it was so loud that it was hard to hear the woman behind the counter as I was ordering. I said the music was really loud. She just smiled at me. Maybe she couldn't hear me? I may return but won't eat in again.,1
"Before posting my review, I browsed through past reviews to assess whether my experience was an isolated one. Apparently not. I generally enjoyed the efficient service, cozy atmosphere the coloured wires on the light fixtures don't work, sorry and the food but OMG too salty. In particular, the risotto was so salty that I could not finish it. Too bad.",1
"We made reservations at The Deli for Thanksgiving several weeks in advance. We got back from a trip out of country that day and took the excited kids over for dinner. The place was closed. Thanks for nothing, The Deli. Would a phone call telling us you changed your schedule for Thanksgiving have been so hard?",1
"Tried to go here for a nice coffee and a read on a Sunday evening. While the coffee was excellent, two or three of the proprietor's very loud entire conversation clear as a bell from across the room and sweary friends were installed. Reading or having a conversation weren't really feasible. Won't be going back.",1
What makes me coming back to this place? EGGROLLS! They are so different then the regular pork or veggie rolls! They have ground pork in these with a spice to it! I am addicted to them I had the chow mein for the first time here and I am happy with the results! The food is always so hot and tasty. Very fast and kind service.,2
"If you like traditional Cirque shows, this is not for you. There is very little acrobatic or ""strong man "" performance in this one. I absolutely expected the nudity and ""racy "" script but I just didn't care for the shows' sense of humor or acts. Neither my husband or I found it terribly entertaining. Just a bummer that we expected more action like a typical Cirque de Soleil. nBummer",1
If you want to feel llike you're sitting in a diner in somewhere in the Village eating bagels this is the place! It's nothing fancy and you probably won't find any tourists in here or gamblers for that matter . But the bagels are the best ones I had outside of New York City. And their Lox Cream Cheese spread is awesome! I would come back here just for that.!,2
At .55 an ounce it was nothing to write home about. Same favors as everywhere else. Toppings are not labeled so had to ask what they were. Worst of all there was a really bad smell. Asked worker what it was and they said it was the mop. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to having a yogurt shop close by.,1
Stopped by for breakfast. The food being served to others looked decent but the service was horrible. After three or four waitstaff and at least 20 minutes we got coffee and then were told the kitchen stopped serving breakfast. The place was not busy and seemed over staffed but apparently clueless about actual service.,1
Its fabric heaven. Come when you have time. And if your like me hide your wallet from yourself. Had lots of fabric for outdoor furniture too. Staff was busy so i had to go find someone to help me get some fabric cut. Service is three stars nFabric selection is five nPrices are three stars too but you get what you pay for!,2
I understand its new but the employees have no urgency. The line I stood in was about 25 people and they were just taking their time. Took about 30 minutes just to order. I like chipotle but its not worth the wait. I could have had a sit down meal in the time it took just to order. Definitely not fast food.,1
"Would give them zero if I could. Employees seem to happy to be miserable and treat customers like they are five year old. Service is non existent, place looks like a 70's basement with vintage TV and I refuse to use them again. This seems to be the go to location for area car dealers when rentals are needed and i will not do it again. I will ride my bike instead of using them.",1
"R I P O F F The service was excellent that's a very major pro. However, I expect that when I pay about 100 a person. Better comparables include Morton's nRuth's Chris nMastro's nFleming's heck maybe Lone Star. Seriously I still can't figure out the theme or the goal of this place other than it's in a great hotel and pictures of Emeril's food was everywhere. Pass.",1
I'm a big fan of good ribs and this place fell short of good ribs. The price wasn't bad because of the 10 for 20 coupon I bought on Yelp but they quality just wasn't there. The ribs weren't tender and a little cold I used extra bbq sauce cause the taste of the ribs wasn't very good. I do want to say the service was good though.,1
"Great location and views of the lake but the food needs some work and the service could be better. I order the Captain's Fries and they were soggy and limp, as if they had been fried yesterday. There wasn't any crisp to them what so ever. The ""Aioli "" tasted like it came from a food service can. I expected better from this place.",1
"We had Christmas brunch at Ember Grille today, and it was WONDERFUL! So many delicious offerings including seafood, meats, artisanal cheeses, breakfast foods and a fabulous dessert selection. We used to go to the brunch at Ballantyne Hotel every year, and Ember Grille is as good, if not better. Already planning to go back next year!",2
This place was pretty good. The pizza was a thick pan and the crust was fantastic. Their supreme pizza is really good and just loaded with toppings. There is a happy hour that has some good deals. Our server was kind of a jerk but the other servers were nice. There are some TVs to watch the game as well.,2
"I don't usually give places that are afforable and decent low marks, but recently i visited during half price and they kicked us out of the restaurant at 10 55 they close at 11 , when we weren't finished eating. They also are generally just really terrible at retrieving things that we request such as water etc. The food is fine, nothing extra special, service is terrible, prices are good.",1
"Excellent BBQ and Mac N Cheese. The Texas toast was melted butter on white bread which did not appear to have been toasted. This place has the quality to AMP up the decor. Their BBQ blows Jim and Nicks away, but the decor is like a cheap dive. The owners should look at Midwood for some interior design options. This is more of a take out for dinner than a dine in.",2
"Small place with a nice local feel with lots of regulars. Amazing list vegetable side dishes fries okra was good, spinach was passable, not sure if any are fresh. Strange thing was 2.15 for one can of Coke. I guess they need to make a profit somehow. Next time I'll look at the price for iced tea and try that.",1
"Convenient local location, but every time we go there, the line is long and they are always struggling to find enough cars for all the reservations. I don't know if that is the fault of the local office or if it is Hertz in general, but what is the point of a reservation if not to make sure you have sufficient cars available.",1
"It truly is amazing to taste such gorgeous dishes. Ones that we take for granted, yet when cooked by genius chefs anything but ordinary. Yes it's expensive, but if you ever wanted to try the absolute best you must try this, once in your life! 5 stars just under rates it ! Add it to your bucket list ",2
Disappointing all around. More expensive sushi than Kabuki or other mainstream places AND you don't get that true Biltmore dining experience. Customer service was sub par and they were out of lobster and scallops. How are they going to be out of their big ticket items? It wasn't even a busy day to be out of items or expect rushed service.,1
"It's a little out of the way for me, but it's always worth the drive. I always end up eating at Taco Bell, but I never know why I don't go to Dell Taco more often. The steak tacos are delicious and the crinkle fries are yummy, throw in a churro and you've got a great meal. Wish it was closer, but I'm never sorry I made the drive.",2
"My family has been going to this church since it was a temporary building in the early 90's. We've grown together with the parish and we plan to continue to be a part of this community as long as we live in Las Vegas. Even though we moved to a different parish's region, we still attend St. Joseph's. The church is large and comfortable and the priests staff are friendly.",2
Getting past the snobby hipster at the register was the worst part. We definitely felt like we were imposing in her by asking questions and ordering. nAdding half and half from the carton to my iced toddy took some if the magic out of my toddy drinking experience but we enjoyed the music and vibe overall. Point deduction for uncomfortable chairs!,1
"America's has, by far, the best bean cheese burritos in the valley. It's huge, cheesy, messy, and is almost as good as my Grandma used to make. Today I scored an XL bean cheese burrito, chips salsa, and a large iced tea for under 8. Service is really, really friendly and even during the height of the lunch rush, they're fast! Love it!",2
"Loved this location so much but the last three visits included a 10 minute wait in line and they still said, ""pull around and wait for the food "" way to pull best practices from all the other shitty fast food joints. At least the guy was honest and said he gave our food to the car ahead of us and needed to recook everything. Advice go to another location!",1
"While the wings are bigger than they used to be, they're also more expensive. Service is so prescribed and impersonal that it's really a turnoff. And when our table spends the better part of a hundred bucks, we get charged for a chaser? Really? How awful. Skip this location and the entire chain in general and find a good local wings place instead.",1
"This location is pretty terrible. There's people walking inside and out always asking for money and there are cops always present. Most of the food I've ever got at the deli was cold and if you want to get everything you want, you might as well come during restock. The only reason that I gave this a 2 was because unfortunately I've been to a worse Walmart.",1
"On my roof is a ten year old solar pool heater. Apparently, some of the matting had become unglued and was noisily flapping around in the wind. The technician from Naylor quickly assessed the situation and completed the work in the same visit. The price was about right and he was on time, even slightly early!",2
"Food is good but service is awful! We went twice and each time it's the same thing, takes forever to get waited on, servers don't check back to see if you need anything and one time they took so long to wait on us that dim sum ended. Don't waste your time go to Changs on Decatur instead! I would not recommend unless you want subpar food at over the top prices.",1
"NO GARLIC FRIES?!? BLASPHEMY! After exploring every nook and cranny of the D terminal searching for something remotely edible, I saw Gordon Biersch and my salivary glands immediately went into overdrive thinking about those sinfully good garlic fries. So I pony up to the bar and.D E N I E D! They only serve pre made sandwiches. WEEEEEEAK!",1
"Love this little place! Had a great flavored coffee, caramel chocolate, and a pumpkin chocolate chip scone. Both very very good. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. It's a great space to relax. It does get a little busy around lunch time, but not too bad. I enjoy the quiet mornings. Great place!",2
"we went over for dinner and were craving the taste of home,we ordered the black daal,chicken tikka masala and naan,the daal was excellent the chicken and naan were good,they had that yummy mint chutney and pickles to choose from and a nice selection of wines.they even have TVs with the bollywood song and dance channel on.enjoy!",2
I went to this location on 8 31 during their 1.31 scoop event and I have to say it was the worst experience I've ever had. There was a line out the door with only one employee working. It took over an hour to get a scoop of of Ice Cream and by the time I went to pay it was melted due to the long wait and lack of air conditioning. I will not be going back to this location anytime soon.,1
"This was the coolest brunch I've been to. Great selection and presentation. I like that it's served as individual portions not as a huge pile of food to scoop out. Very fresh, gourmet options. I got so full I didn't even get to the desert area. We got there early and had zero wait time. Service was great too. Delicious!",2
"FYI, get the pan roast at less mild to medium spice. I tried it very mild due to sharing it with a friend that doesn't care for spicy. But wow, the flavor was totally different. I'm definitely not going to knock down a star for that. I wish the lines weren't so long! I've stopped by 3 4 times now, and each time the wait looks to be 45 minutes, so i had to pass But i can't wait to eat it again!",2
"Beautiful property. nLarge room included kitchen, couch chairs, etc. Huge bathroom. nGave a 20 to the person at the desk and she upgraded us to a strip view room. nIt's the north end of the strip, and a block off LVB. Shuttles run every 10min to Ceasar's and Wynn. nAt the moment, the space adjacent to the hotel is an undeveloped, dirt lot, so it's an ugly view next door. nPool was kind of boring.",2
"Cool store. Clean, well organized, and TONS of candy novelty gift items. Employees were friendly, greeting guests upon entry, and offering their help iavigating the store. Some pretty unique adult themed candies can be found here. I wish I'd purchased some stuff when I first visited the store. I'd planned to return later to do gift shopping, but unfortunately, we got busy and didn't make it back ",2
"Went in today because of the Yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed. The staff is very friendly and they were extremely careful and gentle with our cats, and even though one of them got a shot, he didn't fuss or appear to be too panicked over it. Will happily take my animals back here again as needed.",2
"Good place to grab a glass or two of wine and enjoy some calamari before heading to dinner at one of the nicer restaurants in Caesars. Nice open ""outdoor "" seating in one of the statue fountain rotundas where the lighting changes from daytime to dusk every hour, regardless of the time of day outside or so our server said .",2
"I was always a regular when they were the Half Shell. Went in to the new Beach House and I was SUPER excited to find that even though the name had changed, the great service and hospitality is still there. I love the new menu! Can't wait to go back and try more of their wing sauces and burgers! IT IS a must have!",2
The place sucks. I don't care if a commie or socialist or nazi eats there. The owners are what concerns me most. I enjoyed the food the first time but when I ready they had the ass't governor holding some fricking prayer service there I was through. I don't care what any businesses politics are BUTT I don't want to hear or read about them.,1
"We keep coming back so that must say something. The food is good. Sometimes it a miss though. But hands down the worse service ever and that never changes each time we come back! Food good. Could be better and don't charge for sour cream but let's get the service better please, would hate to stop coming here",1
Make reservations! The sushi is very fresh! Try the wild yellowtail! The rice is perfectly cooked and served nice and warm. Toro toro roll 10 10 get this amazing roll and enjoy every last bit. This place has excellent music and the Buddha statue adds to the ambiance. Go upstairs to the club afterwards no cover w purchase of an entre !,2
"The owner is clearly very passionate about his food. He makes sure everyone gets the best possible meal. He had us sample all of the sauces so we could pick our favorite, and gave us some background on each one. He was very friendly and very kind. The food itself is fabulous. Both the beef brisket and the pulled pork were incredible. We will definitely be going back.",2
Went to this place with family for a birthday party and tried various items from the menu. Wasn't impressed with the food and the quality of the items. I've had better and will not be back since there are better places to dine at in the valley. Sorry for being kind of harsh but I am only being real.,1
"This is NOT mexican. It is New Mexican style food which has a distinctly different flavor than Mexican or Tex Mex. In short, this place is amazing. Very tasty and unique flavors that you don't really find anywhere else. Do make a reservation because the place is always packed. Pass on the margarita because they're too damn sweet.",2
"I love the food at Yogis, great taste at a good value. I've been to this location twice and had bad service both times. The young girl that works the counter seemed very annoyed that I stopped in, no greeting, no thank you, just a sigh and role of her eyes. I now drive a little farther to the Chandler Blvd Kyrene location to get my Yogis fix.",1
"What a debacle. 90 minutes later, no food, then they want me to accept and pay for 45 minute old, cold food. No offer of anything to make up for their mistake. Instead the unpleasant girl on the phone started arguing with me saying that I shouldn't have expected it in 45 minutes just because that's what the delivery confirmation said. ""That's not the actual wait time. "" Uh. Ok. Um, bye?",1
I usually go to this Starbucks since it's in my neighborhood and it's overall mediocre. the employees are usually nice but recently I've felt bitterness from most of the employees. must be a new staff or something. I went this morning to get a pumpkin spice latte and noticed it felt kind of light and opened my lid to see this. lovely!,1
"Also es war mal warm und der Aufenthalt zwischen zwei Z u00fcgen wollte ich einen eiscaf u00e9 trinken. Erstmal war es nur kalter Caf u00e9 mit einen kleks Sahne f u00fcr sage und schreibe 4,40EUR ohne eine Kugel Eis drin. Das war schon echt der Hammer. nEinen Stern f u00fcr die sch u00f6ne Aussicht auf den Tierarten.",1
"OK, I'm slow to the party, but I'm happy to have finally stumbled onto this gelato place tucked away from the busier Walnut shopping corridor. They have a very good selection with some interesting flavor combination for instance, cinnamon pear. The texture of their gelato is not as dense and custardy as I'd like, but it was still pretty damn tasty on a hot summer afternoon.",2
"We appreciate the very personalized service at the Scottsdale Cartier shop. The quality of the watches and jewelry needs no elaboration from me as it is a world standard it's the people that make the difference and the staff here shines as brightly as the diamonds. Thank you, Cartier for making special moments joyful from beginning to end.",2
"Great restaurant, very much off the beaten path. The food was excellent, the ambiance is very intimate and chill. Great date place or a night out with friends. nThe staff was great in recommending certain dishes and were very accommodating for those with dietary restrictions. nHighly recommend Kaleidoscope!",2
The food is very sub par at this place and the owners and staff are incredibly rude. I've tried this place out a couple times but when I ended up getting flies in my pizza that was a no go for me. The bartenders drink on the job and it just seems way to pricey for the type of food and service that you get out of this place.,1
"I've tried Red Devil twice and have really enjoyed it. Their pizza is a bit different than what you would find at the average Arizona pizza place. I was very pleased with their pepperoni and tried some of their sausage pizza too. The prices are a little high, but I am still looking forward to my next visit.",2
I have heard so highly of this place so I finally tried it and my god.nothing disappointed! The bruschetta board was amazing. I could've downed the whole thing by myself. I have been literally dreaming of their food since and I can't wait to go back and have my husband experience it. Definitely in my top 3 favorite restaurants.,2
"Those .25 hooter wings are the best! We also ordered the prime rib special for 9.95 and shared and it was not half bad. Oh man, it came with the corn bread muffin which had particles of real corn and some jalapenos and had a good amount of sweetness but not too much. That my friend was just heaven especially when you are drunk. Bill came up to 25 with tax tip and two beers. Who could beat that?",2
"Just got two of the new pizzas with pretzel and a chess are crust. Also,Parmesan garlic wings.and the chili wings. There was more,but these items stood out. The pizzas were the worst I have ever had from any Pizza Hut,and the wings had little flavor. Whoever owns this franchise needs to do something about this pathetic food.",1
"SO EXCITED to have Pita Jungle so close to our home! Yipee! If you haven't been OR you have been and you haven't had the ""Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini "", YOU MUST ORDER THIS! It's a great appetizer and easily shared amongst two people. I love the chicken tiki masala as well, YUMMERS! Of course this location is pretty new so they have ""things "" to work on but stop by and give them a try!",2
The food here is horrible and the service is horrible. Don't waste your money! You will be disappointed. I love Brazilian anything and never had a bad thing to say until now. This place is disgusting and the food was nasty. I been to tons of brazilian restaurants and this is nothing like any of them. No cheese bread either.,1
Don't ever go here if your expecting what you see on their menu. The food looked and tasted awful. The fries were cooked in old oil and the BLT toast was hard. My eggs were cold and my bacon was cold and cooked way too long. When will I ever learn. I hate leaving negative reviews but this visit is really deserving of it. Side note Coffee was fresh and tasted great!,1
I have tried them a few times and haven't had one good experience. The coffee always tastes stale and the prices are out of control! I see why they are never busy. They offer free refills but so does Starbucks for gold members. There are a couple Starbucks across the bridge at Planet Hollywood. It's definitely worth the short walk especially since the workers there don't seem so snooty.,1
"The service was shocking. Extremely rude counter service. We were spoken to like trash. And for the record, we were really excited to relax and have a nice pastry and coffee after supper. Every time I ordered something, I barely finished a word and I got interrupted with, "" AND WHAT ELSE? "" Totally ruined the experience.",1
"I'm always disappointed in my pedicure massages . Until today! Mai gave what was HANDS DOWN the best pedicure and massage I've experienced! Just got the basic standard pedicure and the massage seemed to never end and was firm but not painful and sooo relaxing! Amazing place! 25 minutes from my home and 10,000 places I could go in between but ill be making the drive regularly! Totally worth it!",2
"Nice decor and design. nLove it, actually. nNot a fan of the food. Too much rice in the burrito. not made so that each bite has a bit of everything, as i'd like. ni had the pork beef burrito. it was alright. if you like cilantro, you'll enjoy it a little more. ncomplimentary water cups! 1 star for decor desig1 star for all you can eat kimchee.",1
"If I was a beer drinker, this place would have five stars. I love going to the Great Dane. Fun atmosphere if a bit loud and fantastic food. I haven't had a dissapointing meal here EVER. The waitstaff is friendly and know their stuff. Great Fish Fry, delicious sandwiches and fish tacos! , and desserts to drool over two spooners .",2
"Vons is not my favorite grocery store. I stop in because it's right by my gym and if I need an item or two, it will do. Overall I don't like the fish blech or meat. Produce is hit or miss so you have to pay attention. They have a reasonably good selection of organic foods produce for a store that doesn't specialize. It's not horrible. it's just not the right blend for what I typically purchase.",1
"A quaint tavern, situated on the outskirts of Madison Wisconsin , the Knuckledown Saloon is a step back into finer times. Complete wide wood paneled walls, lantern style lighting , and appealing decor , a seat at the uniquely shaped bar not only gets you fantastic service but also a sense of belonging.",2
I almost gave this 1 star but for some reason I end up back here from time to time so it couldn't be that bad right? I typically prefer chill bars and this is definitely not that. They do have beer pong in the back which is fun. They have a dance floor though there usually isnt a ton of people dancing. Drinks are over priced especially for the 10oz mix drinks.,1
"The steaks were not of the quality that I expected. I ordered the Rib eye wagyu Dixon Ranch and for 75 it was terrible. I asked for medium rare and got medium well instead. I've grilled better rib eyes myself from Stater Bros for about one tenth the price. Everything else from the drinks, appetizers, sides were okay but nothing special. No need to ever go back to this place.",1
"The bar itself, for drinks only, is ok. It's very alpha male but ok.I can live with that. The food is TERRIBLE. Myself and three others ordered different items. I got the pulled pork.and it was about as good as wendy's. Even the hamburgers were below average. Not just me saying this.three of my buddies as well. bottom line ok for a beer or two but skip the food for sure.",1
"Freshly opened on Mill Ave and I'm a fan! The food is perfect chowing down after a night of drinking and debauchery. The waitress we had was super nice, and the security guard didn't kick me out after drunkenly threatening to chop off his penis. As with all Zipps in general i believe their Zipperatas should have the option of being frozen or on the rocks.",2
"Customer service is always a key factor when determining the quality of a business, and this place passes with flying colors in my book. They have a very good variety of gelato, though I thought it was missing something that would have made it phenomenally great tasting. They also have a great selection of meats, cheese, pasta, etc to take home for some quality home cooking.",2
"Everything we have tried we have enjoyed. The Morning Monte is delicious, the marmalade really adds the extra zip. Hubby loves the cheddar biscuits with gravy. Service is always great, and we love that it is a local owned family restaurant. They treat our three year old like a princess, and she loves the birds in the courtyard.",2
"Was lucky enough to have my best man plan this hotel for my bachelor party stay. Rooms are top notch all the way around. Service is amazing, food is great, room was perfect. Its a no gaming hotel, which is nice because everything does not smell like smoke, and you don't make a stop on the way to the room. Strip locations is perfect and close to all. Will be back!",2
I dig this place. I like their menu a lot and think the filet sliders are the bomb! The only thing that I have had and not liked that much was the pad thai. Everything else has been very tasty. I think I have tried the majority of the menu. I also like the bar even though I have only sat at it once. The service was good and the bartender poured solid drinks. I hope this helps.,2
" ""Not a big fan of this place. Went there 6 months ago and my bacon burger had 1 piece of bacon. The waitress came to our table halfway thru our meal and took our ketchup and gave to table behind us and didnt even say anything to us. I live super close and lookin for a quick bite but wait, no online menu. Ugh, guess i'll pass on this place again.",1
Was here last night for a Yelp event. Reason for the missing star The handicapped stall in the ladies room on the patio Its door latch lock is broken. Couldn't keep the stall door closed. Being almost 30 weeks pregnant and maneuvering in a regular stall Not fun. Other than that I've always loved this tucked away location! ,2
"Not impressed. Had the chicken satay after 2 recommendations from the servers.it was bland and tasted mostly like peanut butter. The portion was small, and I finished it in a few minutes. I didn't think it was worth it, and it was a free meal. I couldn't imagine paying the full price of 22 and being happy!",1
"This review is for their conference room and attending an event here, I've never stayed at this Marriott. I've been to two presentation events here, and the food has been awful both times. It was a breeze for parking and the location is ideal, but when the food is flavorless, over cooked, and tastes worse than airplane food, I would not recommend any company host their events here",1
"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE COMPANY. DO NOT RENT FROM THEM AT ANY COST. Our building had a problem with bedbugs, and they denied it all they way to the bank. It wasn't until a group of people threatened to sue and move out did they finally allow us out of our lease. Then they refused to give us our deposit back. Will not rent from them for any amount of money in the world.",1
A perfect example why this small store won't last. I purchased a full priced item for a bday gift and missed the return date not only for a cash refund but they wouldn't even let me exchange it which I would have been fine or get a store credit. I would have eventually spent more instead of never going back again. Poor customer service is why I will spend my money at Nordstrom's etc.,1
"Love this place. I always have great happy memories here and I am slightly biased because I usually win here . Though I will disclose, I haven't ever stayed in the hotel. Blackjack dealer Harry Stauffer is such a good time. I highly recommend you sit on his table for solid entertainment. Thanks Harry.",2
"The absolut chocohilic meeting place! If you think you know everything about chocolate and how you can have it, think again! Vast menu, more than 30 variety of chocolate, crepes, waffles.brunch, lunch, dinner, snacks.chocolate, chocolate, chocolate! Beautiful decor, cool ambiance, very good staff. Don't wait! Doctors say that chocolate is good for you, so.go and enjoy!",2
"I've been to many Chipotle locations, and this one isn't very good. Cramped layout, inefficient staff and no parking. Portion size is below average I do realize that this has a lot to do with the person serving you . The restaurant is not sparkling clean and the soda utensils area needs to be tidied up. The food tasted okay, but the salsa was not as fresh as many other locations.",1
Got a table and was practically on top of crazy loud speakers. Every time I moved from my table I was approached and begged by the staff to go to some old geezers table. I felt like I had to stay at my table to avoid being harassed and convinced that grampa is nice so go drink with him! Yuck! I won't be coming back . The view of the fountain isn't enough to make the place worth it.,1
"Checked this place out for dinner tonight and was very impressed. I saw they offered an early dinner special on their website, but had to ask for that menu when I was seated. The decor is very nice, the service was nice and the food was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken croquettes, the pork chop and the rice pudding everything was seriously good!",2
Breakfast buffet is terrible. Only reason I didn't give it one star is the service was good and the coffee wasn't terrible. We walked each morning after our first to Envy in the Renaissance for breakfast. Would not stay at the hotel again either for this reason. The bar closes at 11pm so if you are out and about and come back late you can't even get night cap.,1
"I finally remembered to get the brisket plate this time.and it was a little tough at first, but the bottom was nice and tender. Missed a 5 star review by thaaat much. 86'd on the sweet potato fries, annd, our server was in a bigger hurry than we were, slamming down items, forgetting refills, and the entrees came mins into the salad course.butttt.it was great.",2
"This place is one cool place. Girls everywhere we really had a blast. It can get really packed in here. Some of the hottest DJs be here . we met some cool chicks here that we went out with later. Our waitress was kinda slow getting our drinks, we had to have our drinks refilled a few times because they were v watered down . but no biggie they fixed it",2
Always a stop for us when there is one around. As it so happened there was one about 20 miles away. You can't beat their chili. The burgers and fries aen't bad either but it's all about the chili. If your felling lucky order the chili tamale. I would move into it if I could. Plus it's cheap. Almost as good as it gets.,2
"Yes, we stopped here to grab a late night burger. The group didn't feel like shelling out tons of dough for a proper restaurant meal when we just wanted a snack. It just wasn't the cleanest and most pleasant of places to sit and eat. You have been forewarned all sorts of odd looking customers run in and out of this McDonald's.",1
"I mapped out this JJ location to my house and it is 2.8 miles 6 minute drive , but I called and apparently I'm out of their delivery zone. HUH? 2.8 miles and you don't deliver to me? No wonder you can be freaky fast, you only deliver to places that are 2 blocks away. Good business model, don't deliver to people in your same area.",1
"The Bellagio can be summed up in one word.Class. My wife and I stayed at the Bellagio for a week and loved every minute of it. Rooms were first class and the service was fantastic on every level. One small tip about staying here pay the few extra bucks to stay lakeside. Its worth the money to have the view. I'm anxious to try the Wynn, but I just can't get myself to leave the Bellagio.",2
"I wanted to love this restaurant, I really did. The outside patio looks like a place I'd like to be at. But the food is mediocre at best. I had the carnitas chimichanga, and it was just ok. The chips and salsa were good, but chips salsa do not a meal make. Wont be back, and I really wanted to kick it on the patio.",1
"First round NCAA tournament, Arizona game, they're understaffed, ran out of lemons, have one bar tender working, and the kitchen staff can't go half and half on regular and sweet potato fries. Our server is friendly but scrambling. Turkey sliders could not be less impressive. I won't make this mistake again.",1
"The people who gave this place good reviews either had one too many drink special or have no taste buds. This food is bland as all get out. A jar of sauce is preferable, at least then there might be some kind of seasoning and nothing undercooked. This place is the restaurant equivalent of Kraft cheese yes, it's technically edible, but why would you want to when there are so many better options?",1
The night crew tonight wasn't so great. Food took a while for the car ahead of us as well as our order. They also gave us the wrong order. Looked in the window n there was about 5 of them standing around talking story. No wonder our order was incorrect. The food they gave us was also cheaper then the ones ordered. fail on the night manager.,1
New Owner and some not so great stylists! Great Clips talent! Not only did the stylist not listen to me saying shoulder length my hair cut is not even close to what I said or showed her. My haircut is something my 65 year old mom would rock! Now how does edgy turn into grandma! I knew something was wrong when she didnt seem to understand I have curly hair!,1
"Pretty good burger. Service was friendly and attentive and I really love those brioche buns. nI will say, the whole food challenge thing, while not for me the last thing I need is a bunch of people gathering around to watch me eat creates quite the hoopla. The hungry bear of a man attempting it while I was there attracted quite the crowd. Good times.",2
"I've been to many frozen yogurt places, but this is still my favorite. Their yogurt has a special tart taste and is always refreshing. Customer service was excellent and the girls told us that we could fill our cups with as much toppings that could fit in the cup. I love that I don't have to drive to the Strip anymore!",2
"Small donuts, large prices. However, it was the only donut shop in Pittsburgh so it had to be done. The donuts blew my mind. I can't even describe how, but it's definitely worth what you pay since one donut is enough to keep you full till midday. You just have to take my word for it and go yourself. but don't get the boring donuts like the vanilla.or the tree hugger ",2
"Great park! As a Phillies fan, I went while in town since I heard about the great ballpark. I hope the Pirates win back their fans, since the game against Atlanta seemed to have almost was many Braves fans. The scoreboard was well done, I enjoyed the perogie race. We stayed with the die hards through a rain delay and had a great time.",2
"great food! been here for both dim sum just a dinner. its usually REALLY busy there's almost always a line out the front door. but honestly, its worth the wait. nthe prices are very reasonable you get a lot for your money. ndefinately a place to take company when you want some good food! noh and they do close for an hour or so after lunch. nBUT, open until 3am! ",2
"The owner of Cici's is not a good person, he only cares about money not doing the right thing! whatever you do if you use Cici's for a ""fundraiser "" don't pay upfront because they lie when they say you can get your money back, yeah if the owner would return phone calls or be available. He ran to the store when you wanted to buy them but not when you want to return them.",1
"We he use Cooper for many years and once again the have showed how they take care you. Everything backed up at once so we called Coopers. Curtis arrived and found tank and drywell both full. Both were serviced, flow from house checked and drywell treated. Charge was very fair for all that was done. Quick and easy. Thanks Again for the Quick service all.",2
"Haven't been back since, and don't really plan on going. However, I just happened to be sifting through my reviews and decided based on the two times I've been here, it really deserves 2 stars instead of 3. Being disappointed with the food and having to pay a lot doesn't really deserve an ""A OK "" rating.",1
"Waitress wasn't attentive, didn't refill coffee. ordered water never got it. Asked for chocolate milk, brought regular milk. These were just some of the minor ""issues "" I had this morning when I decided to dine at Coco's. Note to Coco's manager waitstaff, when I go out to restaurants I at least expect my order to be delivered correctly.",1
"It was my first time here n I have to say, I love this place! Their AYCE dinner menu includes the Tapa menu. nThere was at least 10 of us at a table n our waitress was exceptional, our drinks always full, she always came by to take any more orders the food came quickly. Their Nigiri's was fresh, as for the rolls Tapa's no complaints there, everything was on point. I'LL DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK!",2
"This place is ok but the portions have become extremely small over the years. The service isn't great either, if you don't look like a high roller they won't care about getting you anything fast. nThere are a ton of great sushi restaurants off the strip that are just as creative with their menu but are cheaper with bigger portions. nI don't see what all the hype is about that's what she said .",1
Amazing food Their Special Satay Bowl with Asparagus and Brown Rice is off the charts. Generous portions and great balance of selections fuels this place with healthy meals. Your body will thank you later. Amazing selection from Bison to Beef and some of the best Green combos I have seen in the Vegas Valley A gem working snacking at!,2
Finally made it into this great restaurant after hearing good things about it. The food was all good for all four in our party but the prices seamed too high and the service was a little inattentive. I plan to give it another try. I'll also dress a little nicer to blend with all the clientele that frequent the establishment.,2
I have really had a good time each time I have eaten here. The food has been very good and the wine was excellent. The flavors of the food are crisp and clean. I have been very happy with the flavor of all of the dishes I have ordered. The beef tenderloin with blue cheese crust top notch. I am a fan of this place and would gladly return.,2
"Interesting it's located near Chinatown but don't let that fool you, it's truly authentic and taste very homely. Ambience is like a deli, you can sit down and eat. Me and my husband crave this whenever we have an Italian craving. The service can be hit or miss when they get busy, but the food is why we come back.",2
"Hello everyone, we are now under new ownership. Please come in and give us a try. We have new exciting flavors, new fresh toppings and new promotions. We only use YoCream frozen yogurt, which is the best on the market. Look forward to serving y'all and check our Facebook page for our latest promotion.",2
"Came here partly based on Yelp reviews. For me, I was a bit disappointed. The food was nice, not great, but wasn't very warm which put me off a bit. For the price you pay for each item, I was hoping for a bit better quality. Still a pleasant experience, if not bit cramped but what part of Edinburgh isn't .",1
"Absolutely the best video store in town. Overall they have a great selection of obscure and hard to find movies, but their foreign and documentary selection alone is enough to make it the best. Most of their employees are extremely knowledgeable about film in general, and there's one that's extremely cute. Down with Netflix Four Star is it.",2
"After reading so many reviews on how great and authentic this place was, we were very disappointed. The salsa was not Bueno and neither was the food. We were highly disappointed, as everything from the guacamole to the flautas tasted like onions. The service was great and if the food had been decent, we would be back often!",1
Such a cute place for a bar street nMojo is great and has a good variety of flavors. nThe price is very decent and if you check in with Yelp you even get 25 more off nThe decor is very retro modern chic nThe staff is nice and bubbly My fave is the cookies and cream mixed with the chocolate and topped with all of the chocolate toppings they have available Oh and some gummy bears ,2
I went here with some co workers and I was not impressed. This place serves expensive sandwiches that are not better than Jason's Deli. Don't get me wrong I am not a huge fan of Jason's Deli but if you want a pretty good sandwich go there. I would have rated this place a 3 but the price dropped it to a 2.,1
"Decided to stop in here and do a review before heading over to my networking event. Warm inviting place, delicious scents of the spices used in the dishes teases your appetite as you enter through the door. Mom and pop restaurant, eat here to support local businesses. Hubby is going the way of vegetarian and vegan so I will definitely be back with him and my son to try out this restaurant!",2
"Food was below average, service is slower than steam off cold dog poop. For a chicken Caesar Club salad and bacon and cheese fries it took over 21 minutes from the time I paid. Then they screwed up the order and we got just a basic chicken caesar and they didn't give us a fork with it. Will never go there again.",1
"Yeah, just ""Meh "" for me. It was a solid burger, but nothing spectacular. If you want a good burger and you're in Paris or Bally's, you'll get your burger fix here. But, if you're like me and specifically seeking out a great burger in Vegas, you might be disappointed by Le Burger Brasserie. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could, but it's not quite 3 stars in my book.",1
Horrible! We ordered Fried zucchini nMozzarella sticks nPhilly cheese steak sandwich nFrench fries nThree cheese pasta nAvocado quesadilla The fried zucchini and avocado quesadilla were soggy. The Philly cheese steak and french fries were bland. The three cheese pasta was tasteless. The mozzarella cheese sticks were OK. 50 for dog crap food. Do yourself a favor and don't eat here.,1
"This was our first time checking this place out, and I'm so glad we finally did! The brisket and asparagus with smoked sauce were terrific! Only negative to the evening was being seated at our table without notice given to the server who took care of us wonderfully once he knew we were there! But we did sit for almost a half hour without anyone noticing us. Will definitely be back for the food!",2
"Not really worth the wait. Food was okay, could of fit the same at IHop. For a place to be called ""BabyStacks "" the Pancakes were less than average. They have a whole menu of different pancake flavored but it's all fluff. Service was okay nothing exceptional. Overpriced for the portion size you get. 10.95 plate came put like a kids menu item.",1
Very poor service. Our waiter told us there were no ripe avocados for guacamole. When our main dishes arrived two out of three of them had avocados which tasted fine and not hard. We later ordered guacamole from a bus person who brought some to us within two minutes. Won't be coming back here again.,1
"I stopped in with a friend on a Sunday night while walking around the area and watching the ice skating. It wasn't crowded and our server showed up immediately. I ordered the colossal mushroom burger with onion rings. That thing was HUGE. I cut it in half and managed to stuff my face. It was delicious, but way more meat than this tummy can hold.",2
"Driving across the US is part if my job. I stop in big cities and small. Prior to my visit here, a Texas joint was my favorite BBQ in the nation. I'd guess I've tried 40 joints across the US. I have a new top favorite now and its right here. Im not sure what I like most. Ribs, brisket or sausage. Haven't tried the chicken yet but if its liks the rest of their BBQ.It's on my list to try.",2
This is the best food for late night. Been here many times after a night out only to be satisfied by the steak and eggs and a chocolate shake. The 7 7 7 special is tremendous Steak and Shrimp for 7.77 . The place gets pack on the weekends so don't be afraid to hit the counter for some quick service.,2
"Liked the free chips. This place is packed at lunch time with business men. As a vegetarian there is little to eat as the refried beans are made with lard. The veggie burrito then has spanish rice, lettuce, some salsa fresca, a bit of sour cream and a bit of cheese. Blah. The tortillas was DELICIOUS though!",1
"Bandung's food exceeds expectations. Although it was slow for the waitress who turned out to be the helpful and cheery manager to get to us at the start, everything else came in a timely fashion. The spring rolls are amazing, we had to order seconds which swiftly came out. The chicken pad thai claims ""best in town "" and I couldn't agree more. Definitely check this place out!",2
"I've reviewed the chain but this was my first time at the location. One of my old coworkers now works there and it was a pleasant surprise to see her! I pulled up, and within minutes had my drink and was back on the road. Plus I love that they are big into community service my purchase today was to support the a MS organization .",2
Amazing service. There's no sense of someone taking advantage of you. The owner Jeff is a good guy who will strike up a conversation with you and keep you busy. This is the place to go and I will recommend all my friends and family to their location. The previous reviews are not wrong. Go here and they will take care of you and your car!,2
"I've been in the restaurant business most of my life. I have eaten everywhere and let me tell you, Mon Ami Gabi is my favorite restaurant in the world. You will not find a better combination of unpretentiousness, view, ambience, food quality and preperatipon anywhere. Get ready for a simple, but fantastic meal.",2
"Went in for an oil change and specifically asked to have the battery checked out. They claimed it was fine and in the mean time baited me into new tires. One week later had to jump my car again, so I took it to another auto center and sure enough the battery barley had a charge. All they were focused on was up selling the oil change and tires. Would not recommend this location.",1
"They got rid of my favorite item, Frozen Yogurt and replaced it with a powered frozen treat mix that the staff inconsistency mixes in the back and tastes like frozen Phoenix tap water, and they call it ice cream. I think that Sweet Tomatoes is punishing us with drastic cost cutting messures because of the losses that they self induced with the field kitchen failure.",1
"This is basically a mini copy of the Cheesecake Factory. In fact, they are somehow affiliated, because the menu is really just a subset of the most common things at Cheesecake Factory. Regardless, it's not a great copy. It satisfies the late night cravings extremely well, but the dishes aren't quite as well put together as you'd find at their big brother.",1
"Wow. Amazing Service. I came for my birthday with a party of 13 and they got one of my friend's orders wrong. Not only did they take his meal off the tab, they gave him a free appetizer to munch on while he waited. So considerate. I wish more restaurants would treat their guests this way. Everyone enjoyed their meals and the group consensus was that this was a great place. I highly recommend it.",2
"Wow. human feces on the wall and floor! I am utterly shocked by their bathroom. The entire womens bathroom is disgusting. It is obviously a long time build up of grime and, dirt and feces. I love Michaels but will not ever come to this one in fear of possibly having to use the restroom. Truck stop bathrooms are cleaner.",1
"Customer service is beyond belief! You can be a pro or a novice and still leave completely satisfied. I don't consider myself a novice but every time I come in, I learn about a new Personal Vaporizer, E Juice or technique! Also, Vaping Aristocrats has an amazing rewards program that is the best in town! Make sure to send your friends because you get reward credit too!",2
"Attentive, pro waitress, high quality food, wide range of draft beer and afternoon specials. Some TVs for the sports fans. Expensive, so recommend visiting during 'happy hour' and just order from the limited appetizer menu. Learned the hard way that this restaurant does not accept meal credits given by the resort.",1
"I enjoyed this airport. Pretty quick to get in and out, terminals are easy to navigate, and there's a decent amount of food options. There are 3 Starbucks' in close proximity, there's a Chilis, Jamba Juice, and several convenient shops. They also have free wifi water filters. Overall, a solid airport in the States!",2
"I love the 2 star descriptor ""Meh. I've experienced better. "" That is exactly my experience with Spice Market. The best thing there was the cupcakes. everything else was just average. I felt like it was an ""around the world "" Hometown Buffet. I wish I had taken the Yelp reviews more seriously, they looked mixed and I know why now. The Buffet we did at the Rio was much better and seemed fresher.",1
If I could leave a half a star I would. The lack of customer service today is palpable. I don't know what their problem is maybe management is horrible? No one seems happy there doing mediocre work and this is in general. As with anything for me people stand out as being either really good or really bad this company has both but mostly on the bad side,1
"Pinot's Palette was such a fun girls night! Our instructors Rebecca and Melissa were fantastic! We had a blast. She danced and kept us entertained the whole class! It was fun to see how all of painted our paintings differently! We brought our own food and wine and they had everything for us! Including plates, glasses and cork screws! Will definitely be coming back!",2
"meh, this hipster spot is so cool that they don't even have to print a menu. We were told to make our selection from the options written across the wall to the right of the empty bar. All we wanted was to relax and have a beer and a sandwich. Too lazy to stand up and ponder our choices, we went ahead and strolled elsewhere. nPlease people, just print a menu, it's not that difficult.",1
Dear gawd why didnt I look at yelp first?! Price said 37 when I booked it online. When I got there it was 100! I want to give an extra big sarcastic thank you to Mandy from this location! Basically the worst customer service I have ever received! She basically told me she hoped I would get into an accident in the rental car. She is a word I dont ever put in writing!,1
"We used to love coming here, but last night was the last time we will ever go. We are not a fan of the new concept noodles with Indian food really? The chicken was rubbery and the naan was just slightly better than cardboard. From what I can tell, while waiting almost 30 minutes for our food, is that they have one good waitress, but unfortunately she was not our server.",1
"This guy is awesome. Totally affordable same price as all the lowest quotes I got when shopping around but he COMES TO YOU! Extremely fast and convenient service! He was really pleasant and even fixed a little something extra while he was here my iPhone is a mess . Well, actually not anymore, all thanks to this guy! ",2
"First time here and they locked the keys in the car. Instead of calling a locksmith they spent 30 minutes trying to open the door. I finally tell them to not touch the car and to call someone. They asked me to call triple a, which I don't have and I was irritated cause this was their fault so they should call. Two hours later, I got in my car and left, never to return.",1
"Strong pours, intimiate setting with fireplaces, and filled with downtowns best looking group. what more could you ask for? Although this is my favorite place to come downtown I have 1 slight issue with the female bar staff. They are rude condensending. But I guess that doesnt keep people away. My suggestion? Sit at a table, deal with the cocktail servers instead ",2
Finally! I've lived in Las Vegas for ten years and have yet to find quality Mexican food. I've tried Cafe Casera twice and have been more than satisfied. Nothing in the valley compares to the quality and deliciousness of the restaurant. The enchiladas with green sauce are unlike anything else around. This is my new go to for Mexican food!,2
DONT GET THE RIBEYE. Decided to try the special which has been posted on the outside of the restaurant for several weeks which was the 12oz ribeye steak. I don't think I've had anything as bad steakwise since ponderosa closed. The texture of the meat was spongy and there was so much gristle it was difficult to cut. The only discernable flavor was a slight smokey taste. It was truly terrible.,1
"I'm still speechless. A topless cirque du soleil? YES PLEASE! nA gorgeous cast? YES PLEASE! nJaw dropping acts? YES PLEASE! I have absolutely loved every CIrque show I've seen so far, but this one trumps them all. There isn't much to say that 500 others haven't already said. WOW WOW and WOW! I had so much fun that I almost cried when it was over. MUST SEE! P.S. don't bring your grandmother.ha",2
"I used these guys because I had a groupon to clean four rooms for 79. What a bargain! Grady arrived right at his scheduled time and did all four areas in about an hour. He was courteous and friendly and professional. My carpets look way cleaner. I would definitely use them again, especially if I'm able to use another groupon.",2
"Brent is good. Like reviewers prior, it isn't cheap. And you will get upsold. But that's part of the deal, I think, when you go to a salon like this. Best thing about salon is the location on the third floor. Color was done well, cut was ok. Probably won't go back because I have found cheaper salons that do a better job since going to MCN.",2
"Love this place. I'm kind of scared of heights so I almost called it quits when we zoomed up in the glass elevator 51 FRICKING floors. But it was worth it. I normally hate clubs, but the outdoor dancing area was the SPOT. Good music, good mix of people, and not ridiculously watered down expensive drinks",2
"Excellent gelato with plenty of flavors to choose from roughly 25 to 30 . Service was quick and friendly, but due to the location it was difficult to know which side to line up on. At 5 for a small which allows you to mix 2 flavors , it was a bit pricey but that seems to be the standard around here.",2
"Excellent food, thanks to yelp for finding this. BTW, please follow everyone's recommendations before ordering. The salt roasted beets and beef filet flatbread were recommended, we tried them and were impressed. We ventured on our own and ordered the shrimp with fingerling potatoes and it was over powered with vinegar, so it was just marginal.",2
"We were driving around tonight looking for a place to have dinner and happened upon Bon Chef Cafe. Wow.were we glad we did! The food was so fresh and flavorful.we felt like we had gone to a friend's house for a delicious dinner Staff were super friendly, ambiance was comfortable and cozy and the food was divine! So happy we ended up here tonight ",2
I always leave here happy and full! The cocktails are very tasty and at a good price point. If you come at lunch the crowd is usually business men but nighttime is a different story. There are always trendy good looking people to look at while enjoying some appetizer pita and hummus and a delicious pasta dish. If you are still hungry try one of their 16 different gelato flavors.,2
"Now I see what all the fuss is about. Delicious German cakes the apple cake is just as I remember my grand mothers! home baked bread including hard to find dark rye! and sehr guten Kaffee! Lecher! One thing to bear in mind though, they do not accept credit cards but do take debit cards . Very good Falko, I'll be back.",2
"Wow! This place really knows how to treat families. I was impressed. Not only do they have state of the art equipment they had lots more. Starbucks located inside building first floor. The cafeteria was a smorgasbord of South of the Border, Italian, Mongolian, pizza, burgers, salad bar, fruit bar, drink station, candy station, dessert station . you name it they have it!",2
"I really enjoyed the fact that all their beds were standup, as to avoid pressure points that often occur in lay down beds. When I was there the staff was extremely nice, and really helpful, and even offered me a deal, although I was only there for a day so I didn't take them up on the offer. If you're looking for a good, clean, price efficient tanning salon I would definitely recommend Tanmax!",2
"sub par service. food is overpriced crap. you can find better food at hole in the wall's like Dona Maria's or Tonys.even Roberto's Taco shop has better food. Also, the Battle of Bands that they are currently hosting is sure to be rigged. For the past two weeks, the losing bands had received more fan support than the ones that actually ""won "".",1
"I've been coming here pretty regularly for the past couple months. I've only had my suit dry cleaned here so I can't speak about anything else, but they've always done a good with that. They have a discount for Midwestern students, which brings the price down to 2.25 per item. They charge 0.50 for debit so make sure you bring cash.",2
"I love this place. I've never had any issues with service and the waiters tend to remember us. I love the drinks and they usually have some special going on. I'm a fan of Old Chicago, so possible bias. I love the food and we never have been disappointed with what we get. My boyfriend loves the pizza. There are lots of tv's with sports and other shows randomly on.",2
"Although you may think different . this place is NOT FAST FOOD. They are located in the center of the 6th largest city and they have exactly ONE cash register. And not only that, the staff move as if they are mentally challenged and have an IQ of 60. The food is typical Church's but ya' might want to plan ahead and make sure you have plenty of extra free time .",1
This place is amazing! They should call it chateua of the valley! double french doors open and a grand master ballroom straight out of the sixties awaits your every sinking appetite. Beus and Belles unite! This is a real ball! Candlight sessions held every thursdays at 8 30 p.m. Also used as a meditational facility for the poor.,2
"The next time that I go to Vegas I will Probably not leave the Wynn except maybe for a show, or another night club. This place is amazing. The spa is really nice and even though it costs 25 to work out, it's well worth it once you go to the spa. The pools are amazing. La Reve is great. Bet on 33 and you will win enough to pay for the entire stay ",2
"we tried Kneaders two times, both times not impressed. Soggy bread, uncooked pastries, we will not go back. Service was ""directive instead of suggestive "" the clients that were there each time were more interested in our conversations then keeping to themselves while we were eating. If I even get a weak moment and try it again I will re review.",1
"Never understood all the hype about this place. The burgers are rather bland and burnt. No fries, only their potato things which are NOT as good as any fry I have ever had. And the wait was always ridiculous to boot. I admittedly haven't been here in a few years, but it doesn't seem like this is the type of place that would have changed.",1
"Bus load, after bus load, after bus load of kids with few adults to manage them. Holy cow, what a disaster. Throwing balls, running kids, and no adults from the schools nor enough science museum staff to manage it all. This was quite an annoying experience, and hard to enjoy the exhibits. They really need to get this under control.",1
"This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I've ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot. The interior is dark and dank and has an outdated ""made in the 70s "" feel. With options like this I don't have a problem taking the extra time to drive to Trader Joe's.",1
"The airport itself is pretty standard. The cab line can be ridiculously long. Even though the strip is literally a mile away from your gate as the crow flies it can take 45 minutes to an hour to get there. The security lines always seem longer than most, especially for the legacy carriers. The food choices past security are pretty lame.",1
"The receptionist at red rock nails did my nails. She wasnt nice, all she did was answer calls while doing my nails she had to stand up and leave me and make me wait and she ruined the polish and blamed it on me. I will never have my nails done there ever again! She didnt even thank me and apologized to me for making me wait.",1
"Never, never again! First of all. The only reason why I came to this buffet was for convienence I was staying at Bally's and it was just one hotel over. The food, sucks! I was there on a Saturday for their lunch brunch and the selections sucked! There was not one good thing to eat. The food was disgusting. One positive thing. The dessert's were good. DONT COME HERE. TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!",1
"Mmmm. Chuck Box. Droooool. So this place looks kind of run down, some of the staff looks a little scary, and there's literally a 1 "" thick layer of grime on the brick next to the grill that's probably taken 40 years to build up, but damn is it a good burger. This is one of those places where they go out of their way to disgust you and you still come back because the food is so good.",2
"My husband was craving for thin crust pizza so we came here. I was excited to taste the linguine and clams, but they were all out. I was bummed. I had another type of seafood pasta I forgot the name. It had calamari, shrimp, and clams in an angel hair pasta. It was okay and had a kick to the sauce. I wasn't too impressed with the service.",1
"Stopped in had a San Tan Amber and Wiings. the wiing sauces were some of the best i've had. the chicken fingers in Teryaki was excellent and the staff was friendly. GREAT service, GREAT food. 11 Large screen T.V.s inside for football, 2 outside on patio. clean place great selection of craft beers A ",2
"Decadent is the best way I can think of to describe the food at Joe Beef. Love the decor and chalkboard menu, and the service was great. ! I did have to save up some to afford a full meal appy, entree, dessert, and wine but it was more than worth it.where else will you find a foie gras double down?! It's food heaven, but not for those on a diet.",2
"Went for lunch with my GF. Super friendly but not pushy service, and good, simple food. Had the mulligatawny soup and the grilled chicken sandwich. Both very flavorful, served very hot. Bread for the sandwich was perfectly toasted. If you just want lunch, and don't care if it's overly fancy, this is the place to go. Tasty food and a great all around experience.",2
"This is one of the Targets I can keep on going to over and over again. Usually I would be greeted by a security, which is unusual but welcoming. Kind of weird to be seeing them take the carts in. The bathroom is always clean. Employees are always asking if you need help. I would rate it five stars but their check out lanes really blows.",2
"I have loved this place prior to trying to exchange a tarp that had torn after the first use. Cashier had said grab another one and we will exchange. After taking the tarp up to the counter I was told that the tarp wasn't a manufacturer default, it was the user's fault. I had had my other tarp for over 8 years and this one couldn't last one trip. Now I know the exchange policy, or do I?",1
"Will never come here again! We went there for breakfast a Saturday morning. They took forever to take our order, bring us drink and to bring our order. Waitress didn't know menu, she look so lost! when our order came back my eggs were cold and my house potatoes burned! Bad experience overall. I give them one star because I can't post without it ",1
"Having been to NOLA and experiencing the amazing food scene it's hard to imagine anywhere outside of LA being able to match the quality of food however, this restaurant is awesome. The etouffe was spot on, shrimp and grits creamy, the Cajun popcorn was a delightful surprise and the scampi unlike any other ever tried. Great place to celebrate or just enjoy a great taste of new Orleans.",2
"The best value for the price! Friendly service, comfortable Serta beds, a nice poolside lounge area and affordable! No elevator though for second floor so make sure you get the first floor if you have a lot of luggage. Also if you aren't driving there aren't any grocery or convenience stores to walk to that are close so plan ahead.",2
Food was fair. We have been to the other Roys at JW much better. Had steak which was fair for the price. Mashed potatoes had no taste and looked like cheap instant potatoes. Deseret was sent back as it was cold and not fresh. In the end we paid like 80 for meal. It was a waste of money. Won't go back to this one again.,1
"I would recommend this restaurant for late munchies, if you're craving sushis at night and everything else is already closed. Sushis and sashimis combos were ok. Nothing special here, just fine. When you buy 2 of these, 2nd is 50 off. Service was pretty good, maybe because it was so late restaurant was empty.",1
"Wanted to order a pizza tonight. Called to see what time they closed and the girl says ""ummmmm we close at 10 but lemme see if we're closing earlier "" wtf?!?! Then she returns and says ""the manager wants to close early "" What type of business is this place that isn't open for the time they advertise? I will never visit this place and I'm telling all my friends not to go as well. Smh",1
"LT was awesome yet Dwayne his father in law who answers the phone could take of few classes in phone ettiquette.really had bad impression from first contact just from how rude he was on phone.if my home warranty hadn't set up an arrangement I would of never used them, but the actual service with LT was the opposite experience",1
Finally made it here and so glad I did! I had both a cortado like cappuccino but less milk and a brewed coffee and both were very good. I spent a couple hours here doing some work and the atmosphere is comfortable and the wifi fast. All the glass and windows let plenty of light in and made for a good view of life on Penn Ave. Baristas were nice and overall a great experience.,2
"I have to admit that I was pretty drunk while visiting. I can't say much about the place since I don't remember a lot but the one thing that I do remember is the incredibly small tapas. Yes, they're tapas and I understand that but when it comes to lamb chops it was a chop . Some of the dishes were just poorly sized when held against their prices. I feel like it could have been more for the price.",1
"Recently went to Vegas and planned to visit 3 breweries in 3 days. Eliis was our first stop. Its off the strip so don't expect all the lights and glam. The beer was good, i tried the IPA, not as bitter as a sierra so it was smooth and refreshing. The steak and eggs breakfast was great for 5.99! Did some gambling and won a little bit. Will visit agaiext time in vegas and try some of other beers.",2
"Ordered the chicken and waffles. SO GOOD! the syrup was different as it is half syrup half melted butter. And the waffle was a perfect fluff that would disappear in my mouth, very cotton candy like. The chicken strips were under seasoned, like no salt at all, so I just dumped it in ketchup and that was perfection.",2
"My favorite coffee place in Las Vegas. The coffee is amazing, staff is super friendly and their nom nom burrito is one of the most heavenly things I've ever tasted. Great place to spend some time on the laptop, I love getting work done here while sipping a yummy orange mocha. If you're vegan or vegetarian, you will love their food selection. Can't say enough great things about this place!",2
"Rude workers, no vibe, poor dancers. I was supposed to me comped from Mirage casino, but they made me pay 30 and did not even check the list. Inside, the dJ mix just did not excite me. The previous club Jet is 10 times better. The dancers smiled and the people were better dancers and more passionate. This place will not last in its current state.",1
Another breakfast favorite of mine Toast of Dilworth provides great food and outstanding service. Food is always prepared in an efficient and timely manner and the results are exceptional! I love their stuffed strawberry french toast as well as their eggs benedict. Their food just taste so fresh and amazing. Highly recommended!,2
"Delicious crepes, at least the vanilla bean custard and strawberry one! Busy place on Saturday morning so a long wait for our food but good. My husband and I each ordered the vanilla and strawberry crepe which was delicious but we were both still a little hungry afterward. Will order more next time! Great neighborhood vibe.",2
"I get the spinach and chicken salad here about once a week. It is very good and if I don't add a ton of dressing it is also pretty healthy! Additionally, it is a large enough portion that I am able to save some for later. At about 9 it's somewhat expensive for a salad and a drink but the healthier options usually are.",2
Great Burrito! On Thursdays they have 5.49 Burritos and it's a steal. I had the Chipotle shrimp burrito and my wife had the fish and plantain burrito. Both were excellent! Try the Salsa bar as well! The owners were so kind as to bring our 3 year old a free cup of milk and a side of rice and beans also free . It's service like this that makes customers for life! We will be back!,2
"This is one of the worst McD's I've been to in Vegas. It's super slow and dirty. If it wasn't close to my work, I wouldn't go here.in fact, if I do go to McDs, I will just opt to go one closer to home just to avoid this place. Also, the drive thru is horribly organized. You're likely to get into a car accident if you try and use it.",1
I've been coming here since they first opened in Bellagio. I'm glad they are still here. I always get the Hanianese Chicken with garlic rice and chicken broth soup. So yummy! I love the dim sum here and the wontooodle soup. nPeople coming complaining about the price? ITS VEGAS! nOpen till 2am DAILY! YAY!,2
"Thanks to the DPS or maybe the Arizona Department of Revenue, snicker snicker , this and every other freeway in town sucks. Every two miles it's the same routine drive by a speed camera, but not before you slam on your brakes because everybody acts like it's the first time they've ever seen it. MISERY. It still gets two stars because it's close to my house.",1
"Poorly maintained, expensive, no coffee makers in room, couldn't find food except pretzels at midnight in VEGAS. Do yourself a favor and skip this. Booked on hotels.com, then charged a 'resort fee' on check in for what, I don't know. Felt safe, but that's about it. Sheets good quality, but never changed during 4 night stay.",1
"I use Priority Appliances for both personal and professional repairs. Quick and polite customer service, knowledgeable with a smile. nThey also have new and used appliances at huge savings! With free delivery and a warranty . what more could you ask for? nIt's refreshing to feel good after spending a chunk of money on a new appliance!",2
"If you know the saying, ""What goes up must come down, "" then you might be familiar with the saying, ""Mexican food goes in solid and comes out liquid. "" I've never been a taco bell fan either, so maybe ""quick "" Mexican fare just isn't my thing. To each their own, I guess. Perk is that it's 24 hours in a residential area, but it's just not my speed.",1
"If, like us, you've always wanted to stand beside the guardian lions on the steps.just do it and then enter and ascend to the upper floors.to explore the reading rooms.in all of their glory.The reading rooms of Sunrise Mountain Library are impressive in the extreme,but there's something about Peoria fabled library that will live with you long after you'veleft. That's a good thing.",2
This location stinks. Service is ridiculous. Girl behind the counter kept asking about the tattoos my husband and I have. Rather unprofessional and pretty rude. I'm not a fan of people who try to make small talk with me in the hopes that we have something in common. This location was also dirty. Never again. I will stick with Subway.,1
"I work at the nearby Lowes. I eat here just about every other day. This is the rock in my life. Always good, always prompt and always nice. My only suggestion is to provide more seats during the lunch rush, but that's nothing they can help. Why did I even mention it? Gotta make this review longer than 2 lines. Great representation of the I N Out franchise. Pigeons like fries.",2
"Mediocre food. Mediocre service. Sometimes you can, indeed, judge a book by its cover, and this place proves it. I was going to write a long, detailed discussion of everything that sucked about my lunch there today, but I'll let the fact that this is my first one star review and I've reviewed some real dives speak for itself.",1
"Pretty disappointing. I've been going to the US Egg in Tempe and Scottsdale for years. I'm not sure if I caught Scottsdale on a bad day or not but this weeks experience was awful. Genuinely unfriendly hostess, mediocre service and I had to send back the food something I've done less than three times in my life . I really doubt I'll be back.",1
Came here with my 3 yr old on a groupon. Didn't know what to expect but for a discounted 3 coupon I got 15 worth so def worth it. The fried rice was excellent along with my other dish i ordered. The Thai tea was very good as well. The dessert we ordered was fried banana and ice cream. Excellent all around. Don't let the shady strip mall scare you away. Good and not so pricey. Will come back soon!,2
"Maybe this was a case of higher expectations after being told this was the greatest Tex Mex in Pittsburgh, but it's not Tex Mex more like central Mexico than the border area. I went off menu, because I love pork carnitas. They were stewed. I didn't expect that. Plus they tasted like canned tuna drenched in lime. Very odd.",1
I ordered online which was easy.I had to wait 1h for my pizza to finally come by.I don't live far from the pizza pizza.I did order on January 1st so maybe shame on me? If your offer service on odd days.just make sure you can if you can't they don't open! They also messed up my order by giving me a smaller can of soda.So two stars because the pizza was good and the online service was great.,1
"Their prices have gone up. The quality has gone down. Medium well burger was well done crispy, burnt . 23 bucks for one gritty burger, one small cheese curd order and two draft beers. Wow, times have changed. They just lost my future business. Judging by how few people were there, it looks like they may be losing a lot of business. Such a shame, because it used to be fantastic.",1
"This place has awesome atmosphere with quotes decorated the walls, fun colors and just a real good vibe. The guy helping us was full of knowledge and took a lot of pride in the establishment and what he was serving. I liked that! I had the fusion veggie wrap which had bits of croutons mixed in that made it extra tasty. My Husband had the pizza which he said was great! Can't wait to go back!",2
"Sad, 6 30 in the evening and 6 people at the bar. Literally half the place is closed, lights off. Beer is cool, not cold. Bartender is ok and food is fair at best. Clearly their days are numbered. For as slow as they are the bar is well stocked and they have ""all day "" happy hour with 3.00 draft beer.",1
"This place was recommended to me by a co worker, and I'm glad it was recommended to me. I went to get my eyebrows waxed I've never had them waxed before and I was really happy with how they turned out! The lady that waxed them was very nice, and I told her I did not want them to be too thin. She did an excellent job. It was only 8 to get them done. Woo!",2
"Wisconsin cheese belongs on Wisconsin burgers. A staple for the kids of UW Madison, this tavern style restaurant offers a lot in the way of burger selection. I enjoyed the Runnelstone immensely and the garlic sauce, though very heavy in mayo, was darn tasty. I also enjoyed the basket of fried deliciousness that came as an appetizer. Fried Cheese Curds are better than any cheese in California.",2
"BIGGEST SCUMBAGS ON EARTH! Unorganized, weakest accounting department, worst customer service, impossible to get a hold of. They will change the location of where you are supposed to send you bill without giving you any notice and then charge you late fees when your checks don't arrive on time. Scumbags",1
"I thought the food was really good. We both really enjoyed the butter chicken and tikka masala, as well as the mango lassi and both garlic and plaiaan. I wasn't in love with their samosa, a bit bland, but not bad and I found the mint chutney a bit odd not my favorite mint chutney ever . The mango and tamarind chutney were both quite good. I would definitely eat there again.",2
"This place is Good. The food looks and tastes very fresh. I don't think I've ever been to a Mediterranean restaurant that was extremely clean and modern. The service was very good and the food was extremely good. I don't live in Arizona but if I am ever within an hour of one I will make my way to it. Pita Jungle people, please open one in So Cal.",2
Gotta drop this place to a 2. I've never spent so much of a round waiting to hit the next shot. I feel like I'm at Disney World. where you spend more of your day waiting in line for the big rollercoaster than actually riding it. Can't say I can ever remember playing a round here in less than 5 hours.,1
"Just returned from a restaurant week experience with my parents. Veranda far exceeded my expectations of venturing off the isthmus, and the whole table thoroughly enjoyed it. I devoured some melt in your mouth short ribs. 5th star goes to our personable and professional waiter, Keith ? . Great service!",2
"MBB tries to be trendy, tries to be hip, tries to be the face of breakfast in Phoenix.well, they're 0 for 3 and a big strikeout. Not worth the wait. nOverhyped nFood is only average nFull of food lemmings nWithout the DDD episode this place would be slightly below average on it's best day. There are much better choices for breakfast.",1
"I was never a big fan of curry, but Archi's has changed my mind. There are several Archi's in Las Vegas, but this location is my favorite. I love their pineapple chicken curry and they put the right amount of spice 5 . nThe service is good, very friendly, and check on the customers regularly. The atmosphere is simple and the restaurant is clean. I would definitely go back and must try aew item.",2
"Very good, well priced and never have they messed up my order, which is rare.I'm picky and allergic to a lot! I always get the BBQ Chicken Pizza no onions no cliantro , Tortilla Soup or Thai Salad. Those are guaranteed awesomeness. This location is great for a quick lunch while at Fashion Show Mall.",2
"This is the second time we have tried this place, trying to give it a second chance. NEVER AGAIN The food is bad and the service sucked I am actually normally nice and try to be nice in my comments but I have nothing positive to say about this place. The only positive is that I will never have to eat there again ",1
"For a ""bagel "" shop, their bagels are pretty bland and rock hard. My favorite bagel is cinnamon raisin w strawberry shmear. Well, they failed this combo with a half toasted, unfresh bagel, with a poorly executed shmear spread that doesn't taste like strawberry at all. decided to additionally try a Blueberry shmear. and it tasted like cough medicine. I'll never come here again.",1
"I was craving for crepe and Crepe Expectation was closed, so I drove all the way here to give it a try, with their 4.5 stars I thought it will be worth the drive but I was wrong. The guy did not even flip my crepe over and when I asked he said it was hot enough that it will cook both sides. It is not the same. It will not cook right if you don't flip it. LAZINESS is what it is.",1
"TO BE HONEST I dont know how the food is. We went there after a Pirates game, waited 10 minutes for a waitress while one of the cooks chatted at patrons at counter bar and the waitress promised us a menu and to take some drink orders. 10 minutes later we decided our business didnt matter to them and headed elsewhere in Market Sq",1
Pretty pricey for pub food we spent over 200 for 3 people but everything was seasoned superbly! Had the calamari and salmon with crispy skin. Great with the exception of being a little oily. The sticky toffee pudding is to die! Get that dessert if anything! The cocktails are also very good! I would definitely go back!,2
What a find! They have special fishes flown in from Japan and different places. We were so lucky today that a fresh shipment arrived from Japan. Haven't had sayori in about 5 years since eating it in Japan so I was extremely happy to see that he had that today. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Can't wait to go back.,2
"Delicious food. Atmosphere like my families parties but my family wasn't there! Super friendly and nice.They had singing the night we were there.We got huevos rancheros,chile relleno and our friend carne asada or something like that.All mouthwatering and the homemade flour and corn tortillas hot and fresh.I will definatley keep going back.",2
"I ordered the pickle chips and they were awful! The bartender, Natalie, asked how my meal was and I told her they were horrible and I would NEVER order them again. She apologized and said ""sorry you're not feeling them "" and stll charged me. Not going back and I will make sure to tell friends about my experience.",1
"I've been back a few times, so thought it was time for an update. Unfortunately, it was worse than I remembered! I really don't think the food is very good. I got the mushroom scramble last time. It was disgusting. I know those are strong words, but that is the way I feel. The food is way overpriced for what you get. I would rather put up with the hoards of annoying people at LGO than eat here.",1
"It's a small store with quirky zombie apocalypse products. Not the most fun place, but there are some interesting items like army issued backpacks. There's also an arcade like zombie shooting game in store, as well as a zombie scene set up in front of the store to check out. Furthermore, there is a shooting experience package if one is so inclined to practice for the zombie apocalypse.",1
"I stumbled across this place today and was glad I did. Unlike other antique malls, this one was spacious and had AMAZING items to be found. It's not one of the most glamorous buildings in the area, but it's definitely worth a look. Prices vary and they truly have some unique and EXTREMELY vintage items in there picked up a typewriter that's 90 years old! ",2
I must say.I adore this place! The food is always great.staff fantastic. I went 2x's in one week.that's how much I enjoy this place. The fried pickles and brussel sprouts.yuuuuummm! The drinks fun.strong.and delish. I cant rave anymore about this place. I took friends last night and they want to go back.they drank the kook aid.,2
"This is absolutely the best show I've ever seen! I took a special someone with me and we had very good seats. The water show is truly amazing and I loved every bit of the show. We didnt really get wet. Overall, the Price I paid was worth every penny.I will definitely take my parents here to watch Le Reve.",2
"Theatre is very nice. Seats are not as comfortable as you would think. They have like office chairs in every other row. Also the food is not good, and it's so overpriced. Did you know it costs a dollar to put onions on your burger? Want cheese? That's another dollar. And it's not even good. Screen is beautiful and a clean picture though. 3D was great.",1
"Love this place for it's pancakes!red velvet pancake are my favorite of all !but banana fosters is not far behind. If you don't mind waiting for a awesome breakfast then this place will hit the spot. My oldest daughter always orders the rocky road pancakes, she says that's what chocolate lovers will like mom! Lol",2
"Dear Marshalls, n You will always be my FAVORITE store no matter what happens. I love your style and the great deals you get me. I never fail to find something I love in your store and that is true love. Keep offering those great deals and I will certainly keep a special place for you in my heart and wallet. nSincerely, n Lauren ""The Shopaholic "" J",2
"Breaking news! The Roose Parlour and Spa has just been recognized by Elle Magazine as one of the top 100 Salons in the country! That's right, Only two salons in our entire state were recognized, and The Roose is the only Phoenix salon recognized with this honor. The Roose is the Pizza Bianco of hair, minus the long wait. Do your hair a favor, and get in to see A.J!",2
"The Cali omelet is the best I've ever had. The avocado is fresh and the pico delicious. Very friendly staff who is attentive and makes service a priority. The decor and location are deceiving, Mr. Mama's could be in any major Vegas casino and top them all. Visit this restaurant, you won't regret it.",2
"Walked in to a fairly empty dining area and bar, was told since our party of 2 didn't have reservations we wouldn't be seated for over half an hour. Not sure if this is because they just didn't feel like working, or making , or what exactly. Pretty disappointing. With all the great sushi in the area, was able to take our business to House Modern Sushi which was great!",1
"Small clean quaint little place. Got a full mix with the works and all I can say is yumumumumummmmmy. So worth it. Full of delicious Russian dumplings for 6.50. I can't tell you if they're legit, never had them before, but I can say if this is the ""crappy American version "" I'm heading to Russia cause that real stuff must be like crack.",2
"This place is definitely geared towards retirees and businessmen, but is very clean and well appointed. The rates are competitive, as far as resorts go. The room was extremely spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was larger than my bedroom, complete with oversized standing shower, spa tub, and seperate toilet area. Overall I was extremely pleased.",2
"TRASH. TRASH. TRASH. nThis bar is a complete waste of time. The only time I will go there now is if a friend is playing there. Every time I have gone it is like our generations excuse to be completely uninhibited, disgusting and irresponsible. Not to mention if you want a free show of someone blowing someone else, screwing, fighting or snorting things this is THE place to be.",1
"I'm starting to like this Dillard's more and more. Nice staff, great designers, very clean, it's a great place to shop. No one ever shops here, you can always get front row parking and the shoe department kept me occupied for an hour. Both Dillard's and Macy's at San Tan mall seem to be mini version department stores. Macy's use to be my go to place but Dillard's is really growing on me.",2
"People who work here are transitory, do not want to do a good job and just don't care. They used to have a decent greeter and sometimes a good bartender, but they've lost all their good staff, and hired on a bunch of idiots. The food was alright. Not enough of a beer selection. The servers are miserable.",1
"I really want to like this place. It's brightly colored, my child can watch a movie while she gets her hair cut, and she gets excited for the train table. But every time I give this place one more try, I regret it. This is the fourth bad haircut my daughter has received here. A different stylist every time. Her bangs are uneven, as is the rest if her hair. I will not be coming back.",1
I hate giving a one star review but his place blows. They only have one person working so it took 25 minutes for a gyro to be done. That was crazy. And then it was not even good. And to top it off they charge you for the tzatziki sauce.that was really just plain greek yogurt. nI wont be eating here again.,1
"We went for a bachelorette party on a Saturday night. Unfortunately, we were the only group there, but we got a lot of attention from the male dancers. The show was definitely entertaining and most of the dancers were having fun with it. The club looked really nice but we didn't stay longer as we had a checklist to complete. Would definitely consider coming back! The staff was super nice too!",2
"The food wasn't the problem, had the buffet on a Saturday afternoon, and there was plenty of pizza, breadsticks, salad, etc. But I was unaware that I should have brought my own 2 liter of pop. The waitress, Carolynne was BAD, never came to the table at ALL. But did stop at one of the tables near by many times. Now she maybe a good waitress but if she's has more than 1 table your in trouble!",1
"They've shown some improvement. I ate at Bliss opening weekend and was not impressed. However, I gave it a second chance and had a much better experience. I had a grilled cheese sandwich with the creamy tomato soup. My boyfriend had the Bliss Burger. Both were great comfort food. We'll be back again.",2
"Bomb ass sandwiches. I've tried several sandwiches and they're all pretty damn good. Usually I get the full montagu, or sometimes the caprese when I have a lighter appetite. But really, it's all good. I think what makes it is the bread. Crusty, soft, warm bread. The filling could be anything and it would be delicious. Plus they make your sandwiches super fast and it's not bad on your wallet.",2
"The service was okay with the waiter but the paying for the bill was horrible, we waited for 10 minutes at the stand and no one came. They do not have a kids menu which was sad but they did cater more towards the elderly with discounts as well. I would not go back because it was nothing special but the retro decorations made it an interesting stop!",1
"I had a good experience here. It is a small place, but clean with nice decor. Being that it was my first visit, I wanted to try a variety of things. I am not picky and will try most anything, so i asked the sushi chef to just make things that he would recommend. I wasn't disappointed and enjoyed all of the things he made. Get yourselves a professional sign!",2
"The star of the show here was the tempura ice cream. I have been dreaming about having this again since we came here. Besides that, I didn't care for this place too much. The fish was all drenched in vinegar, which I'm not a fan of. I prefer for them to use that sparingly. I could tell the fish was good but I couldn't really enjoy that when it was covered vinegar and sauces.",1
"Ich war mittlerweile u00fcber 5 mal im mogogo und war jedes mal vom Essen und der Gesamtambiente begeistert.das Essen ist super lecker, das afrikanische Bier Bananengeschmack ist empfehlenswert, und die Bedingung ist sehr freundlich und unterhaltsam. nIch kann dieses Restaurant ohne Bedenken weiterempfehlen!",2
Steak Spud Factory You'd think they'd served steak sandwiches and stuffed potatoes but NO. They have a mix of bar food items and mexican. I tried the Taco Salad and What a MISTAKE. with La Salsa next door I should have known better. It was Cheesesteak meat used and the thing was COVERED in sour cream. YUCK!,1
Stopped here for dinner the food was below average as was the service. I would have liked to have desert but since a waitress would have been required to order it I was out of luck as she never showed again after the food was served. After waiting forever for a check we finally went to the register and asked if we could pay. No tip was left which is rare for me.,1
"Was in the area looking for a spot to eat breakfast I wished we had went to Dennys instead. Overall the food taste not so good I had eggs, bread, and hashbrowns. We also had the biscuit and gravy tasted to salty. Our server was ok she took our order that was it. The other servers looked like they didn't want to be working a morning shift.",1
Been there twice now and had the falafel dinner both times and both times they were made very well.the flavor is above average when I compare to other falafel I've had. My wife had lentils the most recent time and she loved them and she is pretty picky about lentils. The price is abit inflated but the experiences thus far haven't detered me from worrying about that.,2
"I really enjoy this place. Great value and lots of flavors to choose from. I'm not really a fan of their packaging since the cardboard container usually leaves or drips all over me, but it's nice that they are trying to be ecological. Chile limon is my favorite of all the toppings. The Hawaiian flavors are the best bet.",2
"This is a lot of fusion, not necessarily traditional Thai but there are a lot of great curries. I had the green curry, my friend had the Pad Thai, and I'd come back for these for sure. Come for happy hour between 3 6, or lunch specials, which were also really cheap. Looked like all drinks during happy hour were less than 5 , and lunch specials with a drink for less than 9 ",2
"If you are looking for a good spot to get a great oil change. this is your spot. They are super friendly, have never tried to ""sell "" me all the extras that you sometimes get when you take your car in for an oil change. Their oil change is very extensive as well. You can usually grab a coupon online for 22 for the complete oil change.",2
uh.I wish I could rate 0 STARS! The employees here are worthless. They are teenagers who don't care about customer service. I waited 45 minutes for ONE smoothie. Countless people who came in AFTER me had received their smoothie before me! This is ridiculous. Not one employee thought it was important to mention why my drink order was taking so long let alone apologize. NEVER AGAIN!,1
"This is an essentially useless transportation tool. You have to walk further to get to it and from it than you would if you just walked to the place you were trying to go. Not only that, it's 5 one way so for two people, that is the price of a cab for most 2 mile trips. The views are kind of cool and it is clean. I also like the 'idea' of the monorail hence the two stars.",1
Went here for lunch. Got white rice and orange chicken. The rice was undercooked and crunchy. The orange chicken tasted like chickeuggets. Pretty sure they forgot the orange sauce. Chicken was also a little over cooked and pretty dry. Also. what Panda or any Chinese food place DOES NOT have chop sticks?!?!?!,1
"Eh overall. I usually love the yeardhouse, but this did not quite do it for me. Started out with the hummus, which was a little tasteless and the pita was very chewy. Next we got the margarita pizza, when really was under par. Tasted very dry and bland. No real flavor. Overall was disappointed with the food. Add 1 star for the great beer selection. Not sure if I would go back here.",1
"Sorta hidden in the corner of slot machines, this place was yummers. A bit pricey, but they handled our drunk asses at Midnight on a Sunday and did so with a smile. Their Philly Rolls, and tuna sashimi were jammin' and unpretentious. I like that you are in the casino, but kinda out of it and its really good. It's also cool that you can saunter in after a bad luck streak and get your soosh on.",2
"Service and customer recovery skills are poor. Insulting your customers, making excuses and forgetting to wait on them are all great reason to remove you from our list of regular restaurants to visit and recommend. Food is good and we considered this one of our regular favorites that we recommended to everyone until our recent visit.",1
"First, let me say the service at this restaurant is some of the best I have ever come across prompt seating, prompt drink ordering and delivery to the table, fresh chips and salsa. Coupled with their great service are some really delicious Mexican food recipes using fresh ingredients. Try the cheese enchiladas fresh homemade sauce makes them great. I'll be back!",2
Avoid going here. The customer service if horrible and the quality of their work is extremely poor. If they were the last cleaners in Charlotte I would drive out of town to find another place to go before I went to them again! The woman who owns the place has a really NASTY attitude. Rude and nasty. oh and expensive. That's how I would sum it up!,1
"From the outside, it doesn't impress much, but once you get inside everything is much nicer and alot of fun! we played 1 round of mini golf, 16 creative holes that were alot of fun to play. Do not judge a book by its cover and support independent businesses offering family fun that is really rare to find in Las Vegas.",2
I have yet to actually dine in but I can say the take out is amazing! The manager is always friendly. I love the Pasta Martini with the bread and dipping oil.simply yummy. The interior is quaint and there seems to be great business each time I stop by. I like that they have a small bar area if you just want to have a glass of wine and nibble on appetizers or wait for your food to go.,2
"Don't go to this place. Went in for a new battery and they told me I needed a new alternator in addition to a battery. Knowing how a car behaves when the alternator goes bad, I was suspicious about the recommendation. Took the car to my regular mechanic of 20 years and they said the alternator was fine. Moral of the story is to find a good mechanic and don't trust Sears Auto Center at PV mall.",1
Dining room is nasty like it has not been cleaned the whole day. Cashier seemed a bit put off when we said we needed more time. She didn't ask for here or to go so when she brought to go boxes I told her it was for dining in she took the boxes and put them on a tray. Food was too hot eat and burned my wife's mouth. Other the chicken was its normal goodness.,1
"If I could rate them any lower I would. Disgusting, filthy, cramped store. Add in a ladder blocking every other aisle and you have found yourself in the hell hole that is Michael's. The employees were not helpful and just walked in the opposite direction when asked a question. This place should just give up and close it's doors.",1
"I live in the NW side of town and had been wanting to try this place for a while and we finally did! We ordered shrimp tostadas, shrimp cocktails and fish and shrimp tacos. The food was amazing and the service was great! This is the place to go for authentic Mexican food. It was well worth the drive and I can't wait to go again.",2
"I have brought so many people here and nobody has ever been disappointed! I haven't tried one thing that I haven't liked. Every time I try something it becomes my new favorite. Great food great atmosphere great service. What else could you ask for. Also, don't forget to bring Fido. They have a dog friendly patio!",2
I would rather live in a box on the street than live here. There are enough cockroaches for a horror film. The repairs take weeks to get done. The ac and heat comes and goes. The front office lied about moving out fees and sent me to collections. They change the pet rules mid lease. Apt life kind of sucks anyway. Here it's like hell.,1
"The nerdy girl in the glasses that kept leaning over showing her ass crack to the entire bar was completely rude and ruined my experience. Also, it's cool that all your friends from the Scottsdale Whole Foods came down for a beer, but stop chatting and get me my damn beer, I mean there were only 20 of you behind a tiny bar. Very upsetting considering I love the Chandler bar.",1
"It is definitely an experience. Located iot such a great part of town. Very old. Food is just ok, grease upon grease. Everything came out from the kitchen hot, but looked like it was all cooked in the same grease in the same pan. Waitresses do not make much of an effort. She was more concerned with eating her meal. Cashier was a breath of fresh air. She was chatty and nice.",1
Awful. Like many other Yelper's said plan to spend the entire day here. The employees are less than pleasant to deal with. Consider finding a different location. Helpful hints. n Cash or check only No ATM on site n They only process drivers licenses at this location No vehicle registrations are processed here ,1
"We ate here for lunch our first day in Montreal, at the suggestion of the concierge. The food was good especially the salads. My husband had the Greek salad and I had the salad with artichoke, avocado and tomato amazing. Most of all, the staff was friendly and helpful. We'd highly recommend this one for a light meal.",2
Best yoga studio! Yogaone is a great place to practice yoga in an extremely welcoming and open environment. The instructors are absolutely amazing and help to make sure that yoga newbies feel confident. They are extremely knowledgeable and supportive. I will definitely be going to yogaone as long as I live in Charlotte.,2
"I found a coupon on my windshield for a free pita sandwich so I went to the restaurant and got a chicken bruschetta pita and oh man it was so delicious. It was good enough for me to come back again the next night for two more, and I recently brought my family in to try the superb food. Also, the staff are nice and the atmosphere is very mellow. I highly recommend it.",2
"A great place for swimming lessons for kids of all ages. My daughter loves going to class! Instructors are knowledgeable and friendly, which is helpful when your child is nervous about swimming. To top it off, the cost for classes are very reasonable. I haven't been here in cooler months but in the hot Las Vegas summer it can be warm and very humid inside so dress appropriately.",2
"I was so excited for this location to open only to be disappointed. My bagel was burnt, forgot the cucumbers on my sandwich, forgot my chips, put cream cheese on my bagel I planned to eat for breakfast tmrw when I asked for it on the side.really?! The drive thru is convenient, but I would rather drive an extra 5 min to the rainbow location where they actually get you order right",1
"Last night in Vegas and I wanted to eat something that I could enjoy. This place was a little pricey, but the burger was great. It was huge and made fresh, as well as the fries. The burger could of used some kind of flavoring or some seasoning, it had that flavor of being cooked at home on the stove taste to it. But other than that it was pretty good.",2
"I hate to write anything negative, however my experience here was a BAD one. I went in and asked for a stacked a line cut but ended up leaving in tears with gaps in the hair on the back of my head. The guy who did my hair was very rough with me, constantly throwing my head around. I would not recommend this place if you want a very specific hair cut.",1
"We are been here since my son has 10 month old 2008 , and we still going with him and now my daughter. I can't have words to say so many good thinks about this Swim School. We love classes, teachers, hours, location, facility, customer services, movies, treats and the best part it's a Unlimited Swim! nThey really care about the kids and parents.",2
"Went in on a friday night, we were seated in a far corner away from everyone else, our waitress kept forgetting about us, didn't want to get us refills, my husbands limeade was nasty, and we could see our food sitting in window for the longest time, with so many other restaurants in the area, we won't go back",1
"omg! nthe lady did not greet me, she did my brows rough and quick! i paid with my card and she asks me ""do you want to tip "". i had my hand open for me to hand the card and she places it on the counter. no smile, no greeting, no thank you, horrible! i am dissatisfied with this location. nnever again.",1
"I ordered the 39.99 all you can eat meat all of the meats were very dry! The worst of the worst was the lamb, dry as hell and very gamey tasting. The worst lamb I've ever had. The acceptable items were the flank steak and the turkey wrapped in bacon, but not by much. Don't wast your time, money, or the opportunity to eat somewhere else.",1
"My experience was much more positive then the other reviews. nFood was really good and service was great. No probs. This isn't Hilton anymore. Its renovated Las Vegas Hotel. So, maybe everything is updated including the restaurants. Its likely not 'the best' place in LV since there is such a growing Chinatown and great food all around.",2
Fuck this place. Showed up with 50 people for one of our hammer cycle bike rides and the bartender said we were being too loud and running off her customers. We were all paying customers and were not even loud to the 5 other people that were there. Fuck that place you just lost the best night you probably every had!,1
"Had to write an update about their happy hour, especially the oyster special on Wednesdays. Fresh oysters on the half shell on Wednesdays during happy hour . . . only a buck a piece, served on a bed of shaved ice with shallot vinegar and horseradish. I really missed getting fresh oysters, but now I can get my fix once a week. Nice work, M S!",2
"It was fun to go since I have been to the real one in Munich and the other fake one in Newport, KY. The food was good and the dark beer was as I remembered it. My waitress actually was fully fluent in German and her entire family was from Stuttgart, Munich and Frankfurt.that helped. Get the poached sausages, you can't go wrong!",2
"Horrible service, no waitress came to help us i had to to walk up to the bar myself to order a hookah n drinks. The waitress kept staring at us as she walked short blonde hair girl by and never served us. Waitresses only kiss ass to people they know, guys and reserved bottle service. Dont bother goin here its very small and sucks.",1
"Terrible service! I asked abt a sample, and the very young girl working there said no, as she gave my friend a free sample for her birthday. I had to ask abt the Godiva store card, since she didn't mention it to me. No hello, and no thank you either. We'll never go back. I'll buy my Godiva at Dillards, better prices anyway.",1
"Oh dear. Been to 56 North before and it is ok. Just ok, but it was local the other night so popped in for a pre show drink. Mistake. Prices clearly bumped up for the Festival. u00a313.80 for two small glasses of wine and then u00a33 for a small draft diet coke. Wine bit meh, but it was a u00a35 a bottle type and the label definitely wasn't Cloudy Bay. Daylight robbery meh, avoid.",1
"When to dinner with a friend. Food was OK. The atmosphere earnest trendiness. Learned afterwards that the waiter had charged my credit card twice for the meal. Not ideal. So, I called and called. and called. Over the course of three days, the manager was either not in or not able to help. So, if you go, make sure you're correctly charged. Don't expect the restaurant to be concerned otherwise.",1
"Always try to go to PF Changs when I am on vacation and this one is my favorite. Great atmosphere, great service and great food. nOnly bad thing is that waiting area is located right where the servers come out with food and drinks, constantly have to watch not to hit them in the crammed small area right when you walk in.",2
"This show starring Michael Firestone plays in the 900 seat Crown Theater. We had general admission tickets so we were seated a bit toward the back and left of center, but both the sound and view were very good. Most of Michael Jackson's biggest hits and signature dance moves were covered during this 60 minute performance. We thought the accompanying band and eight dancers were all very good.",2
"I used a groupon for ultimate wash. Every employee was friendly and helpful. The wash itself was not impressive at all. I had to ask for a window to be redone and some dirt on the back of my car. No I air freshener, mediocre wipe down dash and vacuum of the floor. I will not be going back even if it was free.",1
"I've been to this place a million times and the food is wonderful everytime. The service can get a little weird slow, and the live music can be a bit on the loud side, but I am willing to deal with all of that for the most amazingly flavored beef and I don't typically eat rice, but I will eat their rice. This place is fantastic, and I go there at least once every other month.",2
"Really good food and excellent service. We did not find the chef's tasting menu bland but we are not heavy salt processed food consumers. nIt was not overly crowded and we enjoyed a nice, romantic dinner seated in a booth that resembled a big half dome. Check out the restrooms adjacent to the bar behind the restaurant.pretty cool view from the ""throne. "" lol.",2
This is my favourite Thai place in all of the Vegas valley. I personally love the Pad Thai and their salad with peanut dressing and corn chowder soup or heavenly. I've also tried several of the other dishes and they are all excellent. Lunch specials are awesome and a great deal. Ambience is nice and staff is great!,2
"Saturday night 6 pm. place empty. Drinks way overpriced 14 for a well drink , served by very unprofessional waitresses, who come talk to you while sucking their teeth trying to clean the food she's been eating. don't waste your money there. Go play slots and get free drink. At least you'll have fun.",1
"Okay everyone listen very closely, Zingers are 5 on Tuesday's This is the Secret, there is an upcharge for this but you will love it. Get the Zingers tossed in honey BBQ mixed with bacon bits then choose your Mild Medium Hot or Mt St. Helens. I had this yesterday and I had that Ah Ha moment. If you like Zingers this is the way to go.",2
"I had a much better experience last year. I had exactly the same Maine Lobster Soup and now, it turned out to be a very very salty soup with basically no other taste at all. The bad part does not stop there, the Chicken that I had tasted like a regular broiled chicken that you can find anywhere in the states. I'm much prefer chicken from QFC, Vons. So long Neros, I would never come back.",1
"I've been here several times and every visit has been great. I highly recommend the 16 spice chicken salad, and the new mexican pork rub tenderloin. The service is top notch. Staff very knowledgable about menu and wind pairing, pricing good, and the time between order and delivery is good. Only downside was the bread basket. Somewhat bland.",2
"I've been coming here on and off since this place opened. Been to Suns, Coyotes, and used to be Rattlers season ticket holders. I thought it kinda got run down for a while but I just went to a Suns game and after not being there for a long while, I thought that this place was as clean and nice looking as I ever remember it.",2
"Delish burgers. Small menu, but I think that's a good thing. Very large burgers with a fabulous flavor. I hesitate to even write this, because it can be hard to get in to this place it's pretty small to begin with but if you are looking for a delicious burger like you get in the midwest try The Grind you won't be disappointed! Go early or late for lunch.unless you don't mind a wait.",2
It's a NEW YORK Italian COOKIE shop. What's the one thing they are supposed to have? BLACK AND WHITE COOKIES! I have been TWICE and they have been out. That's like going to a pizza joint and then saying they are out of pizza. Just pathetic. I will never be going to this place again to check. Instead check out Cuginos down the road.,1
Very disappointing. I went here on Yelpers recommendations. What a mistake. I got the shrimp tempura udon. The broth was flavorless. At least the tempura was cooked well. Also got a flying fish roe sushi. VERY FISHY TASTING. Two of my friends and I that ate the shrimp got sick. POISONED. The other friend didn't eat the shrimp and was fine. Punk. Beware. Be scared.,1
"This is a club, not a restaurant. Just like you should not expect great food in a beer pub, don't expect anything good here. If you want to party with 18yr old Arabic students, burning their parents cash, ""enjoy "" convenience store level pasta, and spend 300 bottle for bottle service with not enough staff then buona notte is for you.",1
"Growing up in the home town of Steak N Shake, I've got high standards. This location doesn't come close. The staff had always been fairly helpful I always do takeout but the food is so poor! Frisco Melt is always more bread, less meat, cheese and sauce. Huge let down. Fries are always kind of soggy. Shakes a little un mixed.",1
Very disappointing. Too expensive for what you get. They were just going through the motions without any emotion. Food had no flavor. A lot of veggies very little steak or chicken. My son and I ordered different chicken but both orders were prepared the same. Had to ask for more water. Still eating when take home boxes were brought out. I felt like I had wasted my hard earned money.,1
"This is my second time hrre within a year and i am once again pleased. Try the scallop appetizers, they are large and delicious. we tried the spicy albacore roll and the chimi roll. The chimi roll is huge and would probably fill you up by itself. To me the spicy albacore was hotter than the menu said, but is was very good. We also used a restarant.com coupon and saved bout 12 dollars off the bill.",2
"The perfect IItalian restaurant in Old Town Montreal! The venue and service is delightful. The food is excellent, especially the homemade pastas. I had the porcini pasta that was so intense with flavor, it reminded me the dinner I had in Milan 30 years ago. At the end of the meal our friend and the waiter took us to meet Mama in the kitchen.",2
"I like this place, food is pretty good, I ate there two nights consecutively and the server remembered how I liked my salad, she also split our large party's check for everyone without us even asking which I thought was amazing, most servers get annoyed over a request like that. My only gripe is that they didn't have any nutrition information available ",2
"The meat is very good, and they offer three different cuts lean, medium, and fatty. The smell of the place is also very nice and smells like cancer, in a good way, just like their sandwiches. The only problem is the wait, which may take an hour or more depending on when you go, which is unfortunate and makes this place not worth it unless there's a shorter line.",1
"Essentially not a lot other than the colour scheme has changed here since it took on its current persona, apart from the Friday Happy Hour that looks to have bitten the dust. n Comfy couches, good, efficient bar service and a well stocked and varied bar are the staples. n u00a34.50 for a large bottle of Grolsch? Pardon?",1
I ordered a cappuccino but received a latte. The only reason I gave the 4 stars is because it was actually well prepared. Good microfoam and a tasty shot. I also ordered a single shot of espresso which was full of flavor from Mr. Illy the Master. I recommend this place as the best place to get coffee in the Venetian. The pastries are very good.,2
"Tried it for breakfast, hopefully there's somewhere better nearby. 9 for 3 egg whites scrambled, with a ham slice, potatoes and toast. Egg whites were sitting in fluid water, I am guessing . Just one of my personal pet peeves. Food was average, waiter was friendly checked with me, but didn't bother me.",1
"In 2007 I probably would have given a great review, now 2013 I say Samurai Sam's offers over priced lousy food. I was seriously disappointed and I felt as if I was ripped off. I was given a Soggy egg roll i ordered pot stickers , tasteless over cooked beef, mushy rice, less than fresh vegis , staff has a good attitude .lack of training though. All goes to show that this place is poorly managed.",1
"The Beehive used to be a hub for southside dwellers and city folk. It's turned into a half nightclub for 21 during the night, and during the day you'll find yourself amid a slew of young and obnoxious goth kids, hippies, and straight up tools. I have nothing good to say about this place. Avoid. Go down to Caribou on 27th St instead!",1
"Went on a saturday morning, the place was busy. the format was well suited for it though as it was like a fast food breakfast setup. order, pay, you get a number and your breakfast is brought to you. I'd be scared to bring a large group cause seating is tough to come by. I had the Costa breakfast burrito which was phenomenal! Chorizo, bacon, and potato! Yum!",2
"pro chix nachos good taste and a good price. guacamole fresh with good flavor. cons staff inefficient, sloppy looking nslow to bus tables, dirty dishes etc sitting on tables nbusser threw rag he used to clean tables over his shoulder. didn't wash hands after cleaning table, then touched all the new silverware, as he went from table to table wont be going back",1
"This is the one located in the Venetian food court and I have to say keep on walking by. How can you mess up a bun?!? Really stale and must have been in the bun warmer FOREVER! Dog was alright, but couldn't get passed that stale bun. I have had Nathan's in New York and they would never serve anything that shibby.",1
"My first time at FarmerBoys, just so so. The Pastrami sandwich was good as was the milkshake. The onion rings on the other hand, were terrible. The cracked corn coating was very thin and fell right off Had to wait in line after being served to ask for mustard and a fork. This was a 5 minute wait for items that should be readily available for customers. Not sure if I'll be coming g back.",1
I was so excited to try this place out at the Estrella mountain event on July 3rd. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed especially after paying 8 with tax! I had the goat cheese melt the bread tasted old. I love goat cheese but whatever was in the sandwich was just bland. After my first bite the half I was eating completely fell apart.,1
"It took them nearly an hour to get my pizza to me when their tracker said 34 minutes. The delivery women asked me 3 times if i paid her enough, not sure if she was hinting that I didn't tip her for being late or if she didn't know how to do math. Pizza and chicken was cold even though it's 98 u00b0 outside. Won't be ordering from here again.",1
"Love love LOVE! This is probably my favorite thing about the Phoenix airport! Not only do I love the beer, now that I was able to enjoy the food I love Four Peaks even more! I had the soup of the day and a sandwich and I loved it. It was actually quite filling and it was very affordable! Especially for being in an airport. I can't wait to have a layover in Phoenix soon!",2
"The place doesn't look too fancy, nor the interior fresh, but it's the food I go for, so I simply overlook the outdated colors and carpet! Decent food, great service, always good food. Today, we had the pork with steam bun, sold by the 1 2 dozen, minute chicken with cake noodle, sweet and sour shrimp, and a stuffed tofu. All were seasoned well, and as usually, the service was great.",2
PLEASE beware of this business. My first visit I was offered a month to month plan that I could cancel at anytime. When I called to cancel the manager was argumentative and refused to cancel and would not give me the number of Corp. Most professional companies value their customers and would encourage contacting Corp. I give this place an F.,1
"The chips make you really full so you won't finish your food, unless your like gorilla hungry. I went with my bosses because they LOVE it here. I got a combination plate with a chicken taco and a baja enchillada and it was soooo freakin good. I was muchin! From what I heard how good the food taste depends on what resturant you go to and they say this is the best and I can't argue!",2
"Went here New Years Day and had a great time. We had reservations for around 8 or 9 I think so there weren't many people there. Our waitress was attentive, knew the menu extremely well, and was also very pretty. Some of the best dijon mustard ever and an all around great meal. If I can afford it next time, I will be back.",2
"I was lucky to stay in a b b in the southern side of the city. nEvery day I had the pleasure to cross this wonderful place to reach the city centre. nIt's so green and open and relaxing. The perfect playground for almost every sport and or outdoor activity. nIt's healthy, joyful, nice, essential, useful. A perfect place to keep in mind as one of the best memories of my vacation in Edimburgh.",2
"Just found this cool little spot and Im diggin it! Always friendly staff, been 3 times so far. Coffee is good and the tea is hand packed into a cool little bag and you are good to go! Prices are good and more then fair for what you get! Free wi fi and comfy seats. IT IS HARD TO FIND at first but there is a free lot just out back and a quick walk around and you are in! Try the carrot cake. AWESOME!",2
"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Anthem! I definitely recommend if you're in the mood for some great Mexican food, since everything I've had the chance to try has been delicious! The staff was very friendly and approachable, especially when I asked for substitutions due to dietary restrictions. Overall, a great restaurant with great food!",2
My favorite fast food.walk in place an order and within 10 minutes have your full meal.this is my favorite pizza in LV or anywhere for that matter.and it is better than Settebello.Peroni on draft for less than 4 .did I mention their great salads.I go to the one on Eastern and they have great specials as well.yummmmmmm,2
This place wasn't that great for the price. I spent 15 on 2 mini grilled cheese sliders and a tea basically bar food over priced Not much to choose from on the menu plus portion size didn't equal out to what I paid for. The crowd is very Scottsdale and the staff wasn't that friendly. Definitely wont go back here again.,1
This place is right around the corner from where I live so thought I would stop by to check it out because they advertised 2 Dos Equis today. Ordered the green chile burger. Worst burger I think I ever ate. No flavor at all. Some type of flavorless green paste on it. It reeked of stale smoke even though it was non smoking. The only thing good about it was the beer. I won't go back.,1
"My coworker and I came for an early evening dinner. We both enjoyed the atmosphere and a few drinks. Extremely friendly service. The popcorn that you start off with was tasty. I loved my blackberry rum infusion. For dinner, the roasted chicken was amazing. Would definitely return if in the area again.",2
"I had a key lime pie here, and it was good. But the two stars is for the mixed berry pie that lacked a bottom crust. I don't know how they did it, but it didn't have a crust on the bottom. Maybe it was magically absorbed by the berries? It was more of a yummy berry goop, but I like my pies to have a full crust. Also, it's pretty expensive.for not having a bottom to your pie.",1
"Food was fair, but drinks are overpriced for the type of restaurant it is, and service has been very disappointing at times. Once I waited 20 minutes before my waiter acknowledged me and my drink order was taken. You might just do better going to Outback Steakhouse almost next door. Or, better yet, Fajitas a few blocks north.",1
"Alas, Amore Dogs has now closed as Qype insists I give a star rating, I've simply given it one as an indication it is no longer there in its heyday it merited the full 5 . nIt has been replaced by Seadogs, relocated from its former home in Rose Street. Perhaps AD will be resurrected somewhere else in Edinburgh, but there's no hint of that on the main Dogs website.",1
"Really good food. And I usually have good service take out . Order was slightly wrong today which was fine, but the sarcastic comment from the kid cashier sorta soured me on ordering again. I'm sorry, I do not tip on take out orders. If you delivered I would tip 20 . I've never gotten a chitty comment when I pick up a pizza or Pei Wei.",1
The crew at this store is not one bit customer friendly. They seemed more interested in throwing out the trash and banging pans together than assembling my foot long. I was adrenaline happy and just off a good solid hour of the best cardio in weeks. My expectations are not even close to a dog a pony show but could you have at least acknowledged my obvi existence. Aint coming back period,1
"Loved it! Went on a Saturday at 4 pm, waited in the ticket line for 20 min then 15 min wait for harness hook up. Flew over Fremont Street and loved every second of it. We purchased the photos at the end too, with the 15 flight we could not resist the 20 photo plus 5 for all additional pics. Was a great time. Will be going back.",2
"Not a very good branch, was happy they had a minute clinic! But noticed a huge line for the pharmacy. They also had a huge line at the check out booth. People there were very annoyed, and getting frustrated. When we had to wait for the minute clinic, the waiting area was very messy. Not blaming the staff, management had this place very understaffed.",1
"They have the best looking bartenders female on the strip. Hands down. Food is great. Staff is super friendly, drinks are strong and the beer is ice cold. What more can you ask for? The food is really good here and reasonably priced. You have to check this place out and try the outdoor seating before it gets too cold. Great atmosphere.",2
Don't let the sweet talk get to you this is not the school they make it seem. They certainly do not respect or care about their students it is just a waste of money and your time! All they care is about the money they can care less if you pass or fail its a corrupted school and I would NOT recommend it to any body. Unfortunately I had to learn the hard way,1
"Ate here again Thursday night had the broccoli in hot garlic sauce. Was good again, wish it were spicier so I should ask next time but I loved the vegetable roll. Please do not be put off by some of the negative reviews. I enjoyed my second time here and intend to make semi regular visits as I live nearby.",2
"I can't even go to Atherton Market without thinking of Pickleville pickles, the Pickle Man always has samples and will get your attention with his snappy tongs. They are so good to have in the fridge for sandwiches, I slice and dice for salads and absolutely love the jalapenos for quick salsas and quesadillas. Try it, you'll like it.",2
The pizza was bad. The problem begins with ordering. The menu gives a few choice of sauce plus a lot of topping. It does not offer any guidance how to create a good pizza. A few signature pizza on the menu would be a welcomes improvement. The price adds up quickly with multiple toppings. I would recommend any fast food joints over this place.,1
"I love the Panang Chicken, and the service is always friendly. It's very clean, and pretty, although seating is limited. n The Thai Tea is very good, although for a smallish serving is kinda steep. n We have been eating there for years, the taste is always the same, unlike some of the Thai places where its different every time.",2
"Pizza here is most definitely a step up from some other places around, price wise it's a step up too. They have a big selection of ""unique "" pizzas, think Thai food on a pizza, most of which I've found to be a one off thing, but still interesting. I'd rather give this place a 3 1 2 but perhaps I'm just spoiled, haven't ordered from a different pizza place in probably almost a year.",2
"One night I was really craving a cheesesteak so I called and ordered Genos. They said it was going to take an hour and I considered going to pick it up because I live only five minutes from Genos. Well when it is actually delivered to my house, it had taken more like an hour and a half. The food was soggy and fries were cold. I was very disappointed.",1
"We took advantage of good Fridays and were able to get our tickets at half price. I'm very glad we did, because I would have been very disappointed had I paid full price. I'm glad we visited the museum, but I wouldn't revisit it. The space itself was sparse and uninviting. I get that he was an eccentric man, but I think they could've done a better job displaying his art.",1
"Anthony was very nice, he did a great job on all carpets in the house including and area rug that nobody has been able to get clean! He was polite and very thorough. nHe should get a raise! This is my 2nd time using Turbo Clean and I think they are the best and with reasonable pricing. I will continue to call them for all carpet needs. nthanks! nPam Hart",2
"I don't want to gamble at a restaurant. I'm sorry.I just don't think it's fair odds, Palazzo. However, if you were a bookie, you would have taken our 3000 bill very easily. Whoever you are Charlie.I dislike you and if this real vegas times, you would be sleeping with the fishes. okay, I'll stop watching Vegas movies.I apologize but I need one from Charlie too ",1
Went to the Monte Carlo casino for a night out and decided to celebrate at the Brand Steakhouse. We ordered the rib eye and it was to die for. One of the best steaks I've had ever. It was tender and juicy with the entire bone sticking out. I was chewing on the bone for more. Great choice for a great steak in Vegas,2
The Deuce is the worst public transportation I have ever taken. Every stop seems to take 15 minutes for people to load and unload. It was a painfully long ride from the strip to downtown. I recommend walking or taking the monorail to get around on the strip. If you're headed downtown spend the money and take a cab.,1
"Hilldale has swagger. I love the music playing when you're walking the boardwalk. I love how you can get tasty eats like Muramoto, Gigi's Cupcakes, Dumpling haus and also pick up a pair of shoes and do your weekly grocery shopping in one stop. If you're needing a day to do all sorts of errands, you'll probs be set just stopping here.",2
"Coffee here is so good. Not bitter or over roasted. Have now had both a savory and sweet crepe, both are wonderful! The wait can be long but in July they are moving 2 suites down to a much bigger space and will have 6 crepe griddles. If you have an hour, they are worth the wait. Free wifi or friends will make the time fly.",2
Went in to have my clubs re gripped. Salesman was helpful and worked with me to achieve what I was looking for. Overall I was very happy with the fit and price of my clubs and it only took them about 2 hours to do my irons. Going to be taking my wedges in soon to have them matched. Support local business!,2
"Thank you Fuego for continuing to serve outstanding food! I came for dinner on Saturday and had the short rib and I ate myself in to a coma. The food is fantastic, the service is stellar and the patio is bustling and cozy now that the weather is cooling down. I continue to recommend this place to friends and family and I am always glad I did.",2
"I would be in serious trouble if I lived in Charlotte. This place is fantastic and good for another 20 lbs on a local yokel. I had the marinated steak for dinner and a standard breakfast for, well, breakfast. Everything was excellent. There are not many restaurants where you must stand in line to get out, but you do here.",2
This place has the most disrespectful staff ever. They are always outside smoking and bringing that smell in with them. Then you make a purchase and they barely acknowledge you and NEVER say thank you. They could all take a Manners 101 class. They are too busy socializing to acknowledge paying customers. Ridiculous.,1
Won't be going back again. Ordered ultimate with the sea food extras. Server stopped by with Shrimp one time. Meats were over cooked and under seasoned. Was not busy but waiter must have had too many tables as we had to wait for refills on drinks. The killer is they burned the pineapple. Salad bar was so so. Overall service and food was very disappointing.,1
"The food is basic and the service is not good. The waiter did not tell us what food they were out of and the kitchen just replaced that food with something different or nothing at all. It took a long time to get drinks and chips refilled. We had no response to our complaints about the food. Overall, you can get this kind of food anywhere, even the grocery store.",1
"Disgusting. Overpriced. We came here at 12AM since it was the only thing open in the near proximity. I got pasta, and the fork tarnished on my hand while I twirled it. The service wasn't the greatest. I'll never come back here again, no matter how hungry I am or how late it is. nSave your money and time go to McD.",1
"I love this place. My friends and I go there once a week. The manager and bartender James is AWESOME, always suggests new drinks and they are great drinks! Food is very good for being bar food and I can even find light options like the chicken wrap or their salad, very yummy! I totally recommend this for a week night, great!",2
"Had a fantastic massage with Liz. She knew all the muscle structure and pressure points. Though not the fanciest of places, it's perfect if you just need to get a massage. If you want to be pampered and get the spa feel, this may not be your place. For me, my back hurt from sleeping crooked and I left feeling much better.",2
"Followed the reviews on Yelp, we had lunch here as an exotic explore. I had the BBQ dried Pho and it was well flavored my BF had Beef soup Pho pic. menu 8 We both loved it! The Beef was so tender and tasted great. Ice coffee is another must try. Fairly cheap price made this restaurant more friendly to us. We will definitely go back again to try out other menu.",2
"What to say about Ticoz? Mojitos! The food is good, I love the courtyard, and their happy hour prices are phenomenal. FYI, it's not just drinks, they have an appetizer happy hour menu that you pretty much have to beg to hear about. All in all a good experience, I've had better food, but this is a fun place.",2
"Really enjoyed the dim sum and appetizers. nThe steam pork buns could have had a little more flavor, but not bad. nThe lettuce wraps were amazingly delicious. nGreat service, very attentive. We told them we had La Reve tickets at 9 30 and they made sure to get us in and out in perfect amount of time to get to the show on the other side of casino.",2
"Some people at my office order a couple sandwiches hours in advance of the scheduled delivery time. It's been an hour since delivery time, I called and they told me it should be here any minute. it's been a half hour since then. I normally love jimmy johns but I'll never order deliver from this one again.",1
"Here on vacation with my family and we stumbled upon this little restaurant on our hunt for food. The food is GREAT! Huge portions! You really get more bang for your buck. Also, the staff owners are really friendly. BONUS POINTS I read on their menu that one of the owners are also from Kaneohe, HI where I was born and raised!",2
I went to Blanco for drinks with my husband and a friend. My blood orange margarita was spot on. YUM! We also had two desserts donuts and sundae. They were both very good and I recommend getting both together because then you can dip the donuts into the ice cream. I was only here on vacation otherwise I would stop in frequently for drinks!,2
"I had the Hawaiian hot dog, small fry and small drink. My order came to 10 and some change. I was shocked when I was given the total for my order. It's crazy to be charged 10 for what I ordered. The fries were too salty. The garbage can that I used was filthy. It looked like it hadn't been wiped down in weeks. Disgusting.",1
"Good food, great atmosphere, bad bad service. I was here for a college football game and had a bartender swear at me under his breath for sitting at the bar too long. It's a football game! He also gave me attitude when he messed up my check. I might go back but if this guy is there again I'll turn around and walk out.",1
"M M Soul Food Cafe is a hit or miss restaurant. Every time I go there, I have to send my food back because it is not done right. The chicken wings are always dry because they over cook them. However, when they re do them, they are usually pretty decent. I should not have to go through this to get decent food. I am burnt out and will not go back. The M M's in California is not any better!",1
"Terrific, family friendly burger joint with an outstanding craft beer selection and a roomy patio. What more could you ask for? The burgers may not be the best I've had hit SmashBurger or Big Daddy's for those , but they get the job done. And did I mention the craft beer selection? Best I've seen in a casual dining joint. B.T.'s is an outstanding addition to Charlotte's burger scene!",2
"The variety of flavors will never make up for the grouchy and incredibly rude lady behind the counter, the 8 scoop, or the only so so taste. Take your business somewhere friendlier, cheaper, BETTER. If you decide to stay, though, try the Lychee Lichee as they spell it Sorbet. It almost convinced me it was worth the 8.",1
"Great place. It took a while for one of the employees to realize I needed help finding something and when I asked her if she could help me find silicone decorative topping that looks like whipped cream for my charms, she said she'd never heard of silicone? Although I couldn't find the item I was looking for, I did end up buying a bunch of other neat things I found! I would recommend to a friend ",2
"Joe is the owner and repair person who comes out. He came 20 minutes after I called and within 2 hours we had cold air flowing. He is so nice, efficient and sold us just what we already suspected we needed. Call him! You won't be disappointed. And the prices are way reasonable. I can't recommend him highly enough if I could give 10 stars I would!",2
"Tr u00e8s bon Burger classique de vieux Diner. Ils mettent comme d u00e9co sur les murs Best 4 burger in town. C'est de la fausse repr u00e9sentation parce que ce n'est pas aussi peu dispendieux que u00e7a. Mais dans l'ensemble, excellent, et service rapide quand il y a une ligne sinon un peu lent quand il n'y a pas de ligne.",2
"We were looking for a family friendly, fun place, to watch the World Cup. They got an outside patio, inside bar area, and another bar and lounge area upstairs. We elected the upstairs area and settled in to watch the match. Majority of us all ordered Fish and Chips, with one dissenter, electing a burger. Food was hot, fresh and tasteful! Fun times and very family friendly!",2
I used to love coming to this location but within the last 8 or 9 months it has really gone DOWNHILL. My drinks are usually fine but whoever is at the front register is always so rude in the mornings and youll be waiting forever. The management of this store really needs some revamping. Not sure what happened but it isn't good.,1
"Stay away.this comedy ensemble is anything BUT funny! The Trifecta show was horrible, thankfully the last act kept me from walking out. Waste of 10. My friend sent me a txt halfway through it. ""I need to go to the bathroom.Hula's bathroom "". That's the restaurant across the street. Best laugh I had all night",1
"This restaurant is by my place and I was hungry, so I went. To put it bluntly, go here for the food not the service. For me, service is the number one thing to look for in a restaurant. nI liked the food. The nachos were excellent. I just did not care for the service. Very rude service. They got the extra star because the nachos were slightly above par.",1
"J'adore cet endroit, la d u00e9co, le bruit, la bouffe. u00c0 fr u00e9quenter en u00e9t u00e9 lorsqu'il fait trop chaud et que le resto est ouvert sur la rue. Le service peut u00eatre lent voire m u00eame tr u00e8s lent , alors vaut mieux en u00eatre avis u00e9. Je n'ai personnellement pas trouv u00e9 u00e7a si cher, quoique ce n'est pas u00e9conomique non plus.",2
"My husband and I have stayed here a few times. We like this hotel because it gives you a break from the ""busy "" part of the trip. It is more of a family and couples place. You don't have to go through an entire casino to get to your room or pool area. You can take a walk through the grounds which are well manicured. The rooms are decent, clean and very spacious.",2
The coffee is great and I prefer over Starbucks but the last few visits the service has been terrible. It is now 11 minutes since my order and my drink is just being made. There are also 6 people in line and there behind me waiting for a drink. Unfortunately when I am in a hurry to get to work I have to skip coming here,1
"On Sunday 10 14 2012, I stopped by the Haunt before opening and spoke to the general manager about my experience and dissatisfaction in regards to our visit on 10 12 2012. Not even so much an apology. I figure that if I can save other people the disappointment that my friend and I went though, then mission accomplished.",1
"The only reason to go to this place is because you are held captive at the airport. It is extremely over priced even for airport food. The nachos are 17 and barely enough for one person to enjoy. Taco Bell has better nachos than here. The Arizona burrito has no flavor and served with salty seasoned fries. The margaritas are very overpriced, small and no flavor starting at 10.",1
"Went here last year, everything was really yummy. My Toronto BBF recommended it and it was no mistake! The truffle fries were sooo good. The drinks menu was extensive. Excellent music! What was interesting when looking at their menu and their decor, was that the owner is from Hawaii! Cool! Extra points for that! Recommend!",2
"Smitty and his team at Motor City had my baby looking better than she had since i bought her. Best part is the convenience factor. As an entrepreneur, having him come to me, at my office means that I can focus on running my business instead of running my errands! Great attention to detail, flexible scheduling, professional team. Absolutely recommend Motor City for all your detailing needs.",2
"Stopped in for lunch and found a good hangout. Noticed that they had free wifi but not sure why I looked, I never use it. Anyways, had the meatloaf sandwich. Good stuff. Worth a return trip. Looks like they have some good live entertainment on the weekends too so definitely a good spot to hang out. Glad they are in the neighborhood!",2
"The place looks like something from the Godfather old school 1970 dark and gloomy wood paneling. Complete with crap brown pleather chairs and fake wood tables. The food was cooked well, but lackluster. I got veal picata which mostly had the flavor of flour and beef broth. On the plus, the staff was very nice and very attentive. Management you really need to update the place.",1
"Same red white colors as i out however twice the price and half the flavor.very disappointing and i'm not even a fan of i out. For that kind of pricing model, you are better off going to Delux, Red Robin, Blu Burger or actually any restaurant or dive bar and you will get a better burger for the same price.",1
"This review is a couple months overdue. The mac and cheese was cold and tasted gross. The ribs were dry. My husband ordered the half chicken and today he has been showing signs of foodborne illness diarrhea, etc . The 'C' grade on the wall issued by the health department should have been a red flag.",1
Took a chance on this place and it was okay. The sushi selection was wide but lacked on taste and presentation. I order the octopus rolls but the cut was terrible instead of nice sweet meat I got the fatty chewy portions on all 4 of the rolls. I was hoping for better based on reviews but this place disappointed I've still yet to find a good sushi joint in Phoenix,1
"While I love sweets I don't often indulge for all the obvious reasons. So perhaps my disappointment was elevated by my expectations. This is my third cupcake from MOB, I won't be buying another. The cupcakes I've had are mediocre at best, nothing that you couldn't get from a box. Next time a getting a hankering for something sweet I'll get ice cream . I",1
"the restaurant changed name, atmosphere, and menu yesterday. we really enjoyed the place last month, not now. Quite a disappointment. now just another routine Italian restaurant, and not very good. service slow and poor,pizza no better than grocery frozen. really too bad, it had great possibilities.",1
Great pizza! nGreat pizza! nGreat pizza! nGreat pizza! Great red sauce or gravy for you true Italians! Great pizza! nGreat pizza! nGreat pizza! nGreat pizza! Great red sauce or gravy for you true Italians! Great pizza! nGreat pizza! nGreat pizza! nGreat pizza! Great red sauce or gravy for you true Italians!,2
One big meh Beer.not cold nBoneless wings.adequate nCelery and carrots.good nService.inattentive at best dismissive at worst Oh.I forgot to mention.World Series game on and MNF.place was sparsely occupied. Mediocre everything won't put butts in the seat even with the World Series and MNF on TV. Some one in the management food chain should look into the issues with this place.,1
"I miss 6 and can't wait for the new spot to open up. I know that they are going to be rocking it hard. I spent many a good nights in this perfect combination of Scottsdale sheek, great drinks, good times and good music. You are missed 6, but it is time for a new approach to an old Scottsdale gem. The bar that truly changed the way that Old Town did bars!",2
The server forgot to bring something I asked for and never bothered to acknowledge us after we got our food. We spent about 30 and still left hungry. DO NOT GO HERE AND EXPECT TO LEAVE FULL . I did not feel I got my money's worth. It was my first and last time there. My servers name was Michael with the pink nails,1
"very good french food. menu caters to the foodie crowd, so be prepared for a slightly pretentious clientele. the waitstaff, however, are very helpful. food is good, drinks are strong, and desserts are worth the price. note with california's recent foie gras ban, this is one of best, most accessible options for californians looking for fatty duck liver it's very good here ",2
I had a problem with my debit card not working on Friday night and I have to say I did panic a bit. I am new to One Nevada so I didn't know what to expect. But I was contacted the next day and everything was made right! I will update my rating later after I have built a relationship with them. Thanks again for fixing the problem promptly!,2
"Ordered sushi as app and didn't see server again. Eventually new server came by and couldn't answer simple menu questions. Asked for our server and she said they all just worked together. Let her know hadn't had anyone check on us in a long time and she still didn't get us drink refills, seemed bothered that we wanted to order entree. Too bad we won't be back the foodw was great.",1
"I always make it a point to come here when on Fremont Street. I don't really gamble and so while my friends are at the table I treat myself to a nice coffee and maybe a donut here. I like the staff at this Dunkin since they are friendly and don't scowl at you when you take time to place your order. Always love ordering the coffee here, can't be beat!",2
"Amazing experience start to finish. We loved the leek and wild mushroom soup and goat cheese with beets. Very good beer selection. My wife had chicken with morels, and I had sea bass, which may have been the best piece of fish I have ever eaten. Extremely impressed by the freshness and quality of the food doubt we will be able to walk in without reservations the next time we're in Edinburgh!",2
"Came from Vegas, and really enjoyed the BBQ! The tomato vinegar based sauce was something different, but me and my son loved it! Hush puppies were awesome, and rubs were nice and meaty! I love supporting businesses like this, and appreciate the non corporate uniqueness about this place. Sweet tea was great too!",2
I don't know why but the food here just doesn't satisfy my Thai food craving. I think everything is either a little too sweet or something is off. The restaurant itself is really clean and cute though! The service can be a bit slow at times. I think the best thing I've tasted here is the pineapple fried rice. Everything is else is just mehh.,1
"It's one of those places that can either be amazing or ""Meh. I've experienced better "" They didn't understand that I didn't want corn in my rice no big deal the chips were hard and dry like they were from Costco you could still eat them, and we did the food was ""ok "" and inexpensive. Service was adequate.",1
"I work in the mall and I usually come here after I close for a beer. The two times I've came here Cheryl is our bartender. She's definitely upbeat and funny. If you check in on yelp you get a free spiked smoothie shot which was delicious! Besides drinks being good, so is their food. I tried the Wakey Wakey burger and what sold me was the egg ad sweet potatoe fries on it.",2
"Got the chicken and waffles and a ""Bud in a bag "", led to this restaurant by the Man vs. Food series. Worth the wait, this place had amazing portions that most mortals could not finish. The only negatives were a mildly friendly wait staff and walking through a smoky casino maze to get there, but if you come to Vegas, you must eat here!",2
"I chose El Chorro for my wedding reception and it was the best decision we made! Caroline, the event coordinator, did everything I needed her to do and more while being absolutely a pleasure to work with. The food, ambience, service, bar were all exceptional! We received so many compliments on our venue selection and hope to throw many more parties here over the years.",2
"damn, I just got ripped off. went thru the drive thru at around noon, got home and realized that what is usually fresh orange chicken is last night's left overs, heated up. the first nugget I bit into was so hard, I cracked a tooth. I wish I had another 10 to go spend at el pollo loco. FML, shouldn't have trusted the PANDA today.",1
"Food was real good. The aura was real nice and also the employees was real attentive which is always a plus. Brought the kids along which may not have been a great idea, kids are welcomed but not as kid friendly as they didn't have kids cups or kids menus but LOVED everything else about this restaurant as a first timer here. When in town will be coming back to!",2
"This is a great restaurant, especially if you are meat eater. I was not overjoyed with my two salads, but what can you expect at a steak house? Great ambiance. Excellent service. The wine list did not get me excited, but then again, wine's that go well with steak are not my thing. I probably won't go back, but only because I don't love steak.",2
"First off, the owner I think he is is a dick. The food? Overpriced and low quality. If you ever had a decent lobster roll, you would never eat it here. What a waste of space! Don't waste your stomach here! Too many awesome places to eat in Vegas for this crap. Highlights n None! Lowlights n Overpriced n Dumbass owner with an attitude n Claims to serve lobster bisque in bread bowl. NOPE.",1
"Hired Moxie Girl to clean the house I moved out of. They were great! They took care of everything I asked them for and was very satisfied with the results. One of the two girls did mess up the shower door by taking it off its track and leaving it for some reason, but no big deal I fixed it. If ever I need to have a cleaning company come, I'll be giving them a call.",2
"Saw WuTang last month and Lauryn Hill last night. My fave part of HOB is that it's small. nSucks to be downstairs like I was for Lauryn but, thankfully, it wasn't that crowded. Made it easier to walk in thru. nWatching WuTang from the top was great. We had seats, there was no one taller than me, and it wasn't crowded.",2
"This BK has always been busy and the drive through always packed. I think the design of the building is more conducive to the drive thru especially since the parking feels like a death trap. The inside is kept clean, sometimes the line on the inside is just as long as the drive through line wrapping around the building.",1
Alls I can say is can you find a decent Chinese place in this town I appreciate they can't speak English over the phone so I'm sure it's authentic but these people really don't know how to cook so unimpressed with the food I'm voting Panda Express over this garbage food Alls it was good for was dog food cause it wasn't edible,1
"What the hell is up with the music?!? You can't dance to it, you can't get into it. We went on 7 31 and it just drug the whole night down. I think three people sat and watched the guys playing. Really? You pay for these guys to be here? Even with the bean bag toss and ping pong and all the good things about The Monastery, the music bit big time! Ugh, it makes me not wanna come back anytime soon.",1
"I don't know if it was just cause an Asian dude, and Indian man were ordering me and my friend , but the lady that took our order was snobby as heck. We were trying to order other things. She was blending some drinks, and told us that she couldn't hear us. Of course you can't hear us, you're using the B L E N D E R. Stick to Starbucks. Or a McCafe.",1
"This is one of our go to spots for a night out with the kids. The food and service are always dependable. This is the best Max and Erma's I've been to in PIttsburgh. Good quality American food, and free cookies on wednesday nights. Oh, and it's almost never too busy on the weekend. Great place for kids.",2
"Definitely not the 5 star that I was expecting to experience. The air ventilation is just not what you would expect for a nice hotel, it was smokier then most other hotels. The sheets were rough, the Hilton Las Vegas has softer sheets. I won't be back to the Aria, there are just so many other hotels that offer better customer service and comfort.",1
"This Italian eatery has very unique offerings that set it apart from traditional Italian places. People commenting about the price should just eat elsewhere. Please note this is a high end restaurant on Mill so, yes, you will have a substantial tab. But the wine list is superb and the food is unique. Great place for a date in Tempe. Tempe lacks many romantic places. But this is a good option.",2
"I agree with David M. Tony's is fair and honest. Work is done right the first time. They will tell you what they found and what may happen if it's ignored. I was also told once that a noise I heard while may be annoying will not affect the performance in any way and the car had no safety issues. They're not open on Saturdays but, they do have a van to take you to work and pick you up.",2
Will never buy from here again. Purchased an expensive desk and chair. They delivered to me damaged. Both items. So then they tell me they can't take the desk cause they don't have room on their truck. A week later they deliver another desk. Yup damaged. Bunch of expensive crap. Will be looking elsewhere for an entire house of new furniture. If anyone has recommendations let me know.,1
"One of the best spots in Charlotte for consistently great food and service. Original is in historic Charleston, SC, when I found out they were expanding to Charlotte I could not be more excited. Basil Chicken, Pad Thai and Basil rolls a must try. Great wine selection and specialty drinks. Looking forward to the lounge expansion and private dining room.",2
I switched cleaning companies when I moved to Tempe. Edward offered me a great deal to try out his company since he already serviced my complex. I am glad I did because LHS has done such a great job. Very friendly staff and do extra things around my place that I've been charged for with the previous company. Great vibes! Great service! Thanks Edward!,2
"we came here for lunch I ordered the sweet Deal pick 3 for 4 just had a regular cheeseburger ,onion rings, and a drink . The food came out quick a little too quick cause they did a poor job making the cheeseburger had way too much Mustered and Ketchup and was all over the wraper just oozing out the sides the onion rings were pretty good",1
I went in to take a look at their ten inch bed. I didn't have an appointment but everyone was very nice! They answered all the questions I had. The office space itself is also pretty sweet! I also really like the story of how the company came to be. Check them out if you are in the market for a new bed!,2
"3.5 stars Bumped up the rating because the service was really good. I'm from the tri state so I've had my share of pizza. The pizza isn't really comparable to the real stuff but in general, their pizza isn't bad. Thin, crispy, and they load on the toppings. The calzone was much more dough than filling which was a bit disappointing. The garlic knots though were one of the best I've had though.",2
"Wooohooo! Great service, great atmosphere, great change from last movie house that was there. The place has been completely redecorated and updated to Scottsdale chic. Popcorn was served in open basket, easy to eat w butter on the side love it! . Good drinks, and free refils on the soda. This was a good purchase and a great value for the money. I advise anyone to try it. ",2
"Bad, but not the worst. Internet only worked downstairs in the common room. Room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good and I looked forward to it. Location is convenient. Owner is a nice guy. They will charge you 5 extra if you use a credit card and 1 extra if you use a debit card. Wifi costs 3 L. TV is tiny. Gets a decent selection of channels. Free parking in back.",1
"This place was a sausage fest. There was probably 20 guys for every 1 girl there last time I went. The waitresses were hot, but some of them were kind of old to be wearing the plaid skirt schoolgirl outfits. I probably won't go back, I'd much rather go to bar where I can actually talk to a girl instead of stand around with a bunch of dudes.",1
"This place is heaven in your mouth. Hub and I celebrated the ""hell yeah I am baby free and in Vegas for the weekend "" occasion. We both ordered the delicious Innovative Menu with wine pairing. Everything from food to service was outstanding. Eat here! You'll be broke, but you will leave happy and satisfied .",2
"You may be familiar with the term food porn. That's when your little buddies post pictures of restaurant dishes on Facebook. Food at the Sao Paulo cafe at the Rio definitely falls into the snuff porn category. None of my friends were able to finish the food, because it was so horrible. We only ate there, because we had a conference meeting in the hotel and no time to look for food outside.",1
Rude! I work nearby and come ever so often and each and every time that staff has been extremely rude to me. It could have easily been my favorite coffee shop in the area I rather support a local business than a national chain but at least when I go to a national chain I know i'm usually getting excellent service.,1
I just moved here from Cali and Trader Joe's is where I frequently shop at. nI was so pleased to discover this location is only a few minutes away from my condo. I ended up buying everything on my list instead of going to another food store! nPrices are reasonable and fruits veggies so fresh! Lots of parking. Staff helpful and friendly. My first choice in food shopping definitely!,2
"Monty is the owner operator of the store. He seems a little annoyed if you try to negotiate any of his prices. As in most privately owned music stores his bread and butter seems to be music lessons, instrument repair and sheet music. It's a wonder that guitar center and sam ash haven't obliterated all of these small stores. www.myspace.com slideroolz",1
"I don't understand the hype about this place, other than its the only place in Phoenix with this type of food. I've been here with my family a couple of times when my father in law is craving the food, and I've always been disappointed. Chicken is nothing special, waffles are soggy, and the service is sub par.",1
"Dave, the owner, is an awesome guy to talk to. I work at a computer shop down the way and I have gotten to know him and his staff well. They are a great bunch of folks with some damn good food! Thin crust pizza is something that I have missed since being out in AZ from NJ. This pizza is something to write home about!",2
"Though the service is lacking, the brews are spot on. The Orange Blossom is a staple at this place. Crisp and refreshing any time of year. Coconut Joe is another favorite of mine. The pizzas are great too! They have an expanded menu now too, the beer bites are fantastic and again, the pizza.specifically the T Rex.pizza. if you like meat, do it.",2
"I love this place. Im from so cal so when we get to vegas we have to get naked city fix. The pizza here is amazing. Im a fan of dive bars so the fact that its located inside moon doggies is awesome. We ordered the steak and cheese and it was great. It was cover with steak, cheese, and peppers. One of best pizzas I have ever eaten. If you want great pizza in the vegas area you have to eat here.",2
"Stop leaving your trash menus all over my house and property! nI am going to start dumping all my garbage on your front door, because that's what you keep doing to me and the entire neighborhood! Your food is crap and always will be crap. I've eaten live cockroaches over in South America that tasted better than your food. Dead serious.",1
"Quick service, big variety reasonable prices. My favorite dim sum place. If you are new to dim sum, the big deal is to go between 10 am and 3 and ladies will come up to you with carts and tell you what dishes they have. You might only take two favorites per cart, because you might want to fill up before you have been offered a big variety.",2
"One of the best unique boutiques I have stayed in.in a LONG TIME. The service was fantastic, and rooms are very artsy and warm. Not to mention the restaurant, Gallo Blanco Cafe, is a great place to go mix with locals and have a glass of wine by the pool. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE CLARENDON AND LOOK FORWARD TO STAYING THEIR ON MY NEXT TRIP TO PHOENIX",2
This is a fabulous Costco! It's not as busy as North Scottsdale and I think they have a great selection of wines. I also buy the orthopedic dog beds whenever they have them. This is the only size my Dobie fits on and he loves the egg crate cushioning much better than the regular stuffing. AND.they're only 46! This bed would be triple the price anywhere else. That alone always brings me back!,2
"I tried Sinobi sushi today for lunch located in Market Square, Pittsburgh. It was 5.89 for a California roll. It was fresh and tasty. The guy made it when I ordered it. They were very friendly. The ONLY thing that was off was the sushi was very small. I would have gotten two of them. nVery good taste though. Wish there was more avocado too.",2
"Amazing Food! I'm tellin you get the Bang Bang Shrimp, it's awesome. The food is really great quality here, with very special tastes. From steak and chicken to the seafood, any and all the appetizers it's just fantastic. The service is wonderful, and the atmosphere is very inviting with warm colors and lighting.",2
"This place was awesome, sushi was fresh and very tasty. Chef Paul, goes above and beyond to make sure your happy. The Las Vegas roll, Tiger roll, we're amazing! Chef Paul also had a special made for us that is not in the menu and that was so so delicious! I will definitely will be back during my 5 day stay at the JW Marriott.",2
Who cares if it's not a bar? It's good! I love getting Fat Tuesday's and walking randomly around the Strip. I usually hit up the one in the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Mall. Walking around with Fat Tuesday's in a shopping mall makes me feel so classy. Get a few extra 151 shots to your octane and then expect to have a good night. The jello shots aren't bad either.,2
I came here for the first time with a friend. We were really pleased by the great service from our server and the rest of the staff. The owner was very welcoming and friendly which made for a great experience. The food was just as good as the great service. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!,2
"Under new ownership. Thank goodness! They recently had a benefit for make a wish foundation, which is really nice. And there seemed to be a lot better supervision. I still think the hours are inconvenient and its a wee bit pricey, but theyDO have a parents night out and friday night "" cosmic bounce "" with music and strobe lights, which is pretty cool. Updating to four stars.",2
"It took them two washes and a visit with the owner to get it partially right. nThe owner thinks the only way to dry windows and windshields is with a wet cloth. nI couldn't convince the owner of using dry cloths. nI won't go back The guy is brusque, and not ethical. nThey have hardly any business I wonder why? nThey will be out of business soon. Go to OCTOPUS for the BEST WASH.",1
"Had supper here thursday night, Feb. 7, 2013. Food very bland, you can do better. Service 4 stars our waitress was very attentive nAmbiance 3 stars casual setting, a bit noisy nCleanliness 3 stars appeared to be clean and well kept nFood 1 star factory food, bland, all tasted the same, soggy shrimp nPrice 2 stars while not the cheapest the prices are mid range ",1
I tried the 49 fast meal since I had a show to catch. The chicken was very moist. as great as chicken can get. It all came out on one plate like a combination order one would get at a Japanese restaurant which is great since I don't like to wait in between. The desserts were both refreshingly good. The service was also decent no complaints.,2
"Its a beautiful, fairly new hotel with a casino downstairs! We live in AZ, we stayed here so we don't drive home drunk after a party here. Their pillows are NOT comfortable, they were too hard! My neck was hurting in the morning. Otherwise, I can't complain, very clean, crispy sheets, very nice marbled bathroom just what you see in the pictures! I am giving them 5 stars, they deserve it!",2
Great time! We brought our bachelorette to celebrate. Good drink specials and the bartenders were fast and friendly. The band and piano was awesome all night! Everyone was singing and dancing and just having a great time. I didn't give it 5 stars because the woman at the door was not a good first impression. She was rude when asked simple questions and directions.,2
"Stay away from this place. The GM is a complete dick. He kick me out because his buddies crashed out cabana we asked them to leave, they started to fight with us and we get kicked out. Screw this place and don't waste your money or your time at this place! Needless to say because of this we took our business elsewhere for a birthday party and had a better time.",1
"I love it! Thought I was getting hoodwinked on a book purchase until I went online and found out the book I purchased was hard to find and obviously priced ""reasonably "" for that reason. Nice and quiet. They have every topic you can think of. I was shocked to see an African American section with worthwhile titles and subjects. Bravo.",2
"Walked pass the tempting patio, misting a cool welcome. Entered this contemporary restaurant, buzzing with upbeat music, food favorites, and brew fans. Drank a perfectly poured Guinness, ate a shopping cart of french fries. Loved the combo of sweet and white potatoes. Wished they would have stayed crispy longer.",2
"They arrived as scheduled. My BBQ had not been cleaned in three years. I use it 4 5 days aweek. My point is, the BBQ was extremely dirty with caked on grease on the burners and porcelin grills 3 . The automated lighting did not work on any of the burners. The end result was that the Grill was like new! Everything worked. I would definitly hire them again.",2
"This used to be one of my favorite places, but it really seems to have gone downhill. Everything used to be spotless and the facility was always well lit, cool, and airy. Today it feels dirty and gloomy. Bulbs are burnt out, lots of things are ieed of minor repair, stock is low, it's warm. It feels neglected. So sad. ",1
"I got a coupon from a bartender so i went to Miami cafe. Very very surprised. Im from NYC the pizza was amazing better than Cibo way better than Bianco which is a joke to me. Crust sauce cheese etc. I spoke to the mgr and toured the kitchen. My gf and i ate a salad and 2 pizzas , served at our pace I liked the decor and music Be back again",2
"This was very close to traditional Mexican from Mexico. I had Tripe, tongue, chicarones, and pastor tacos. The toppings were fresh, as was the three salsas that came with my to go order. Staff was very nice . The decor is what you would expect. I would trade decor over quality of food any day. I would eat there again.",2
"Came here with a coworker who was in town. nBoth had the salmon prepared different ways. nI liked mine and he his. nThe cavatappi amatriciana try saying that fast 3 times is worth trying rather than the standard variation of mashed potatoes, but those are good here too. nCalamari is fried nice and not greasy. Thin batter like tempura. nGreat chain food.",2
"I kind of like this place. Very clean, good service. I played it safe with some Teriyaki chicken and their chow mein special shrimp, chicken, beef , because my girlfriend and her kid think of Panda Express when they want Chinese food, but I got her to admit this food was better. Also, for those who care, they don't use MSG.",2
"Quite the cultural experience for city folk like me. nMy friend who lives in the area brought me here straight from the airport and thank god they serve food because I was starving. It's about 12 for a biscuit, greens, beans and a pound of meat. A POUND. Could probably have shared with a few people. I would recommend not sitting too close to the arena, the bulls kick up dirt. Cheap, strong drinks.",2
"I do not recommend this place. I ordered the menudo, and was very disappointed. It had no flavor. I added 3 slices of lemon, 1 cup of salsa, 2 small packs of salt. It then tasted a bit better. My friend ordered camarones a la diabla. He described the sauce as tasting like can tomatoes sauce with chile. It looked watery to me. Horchata was good. I will not come to this restaurant again.",1
"RUDE.RUDE.RUDE service from driver.not that a tow truck driver needs to be nice, but they do need to be professional and empathetic considering people are frustrated over their vehicle. I ONLY used them because my roadside assistance is covered through them but i will request in the future not to use them.",1
"I have used them several times for my Vehicle Wraps, Signange, Banners, Menu Board, all my promotional items and my Cart wrap and it really enhances my business. nPeople are always complimenting my wrap and the design and I owe it all to Arizona Color. nWith out their design expertise I wouldn't be where I am today with my business!",2
"Only ordered from this place because it was convenient. Last 2 times was very disappointing. Probably will not go again. Too many kids running the place with no visible manager to give them direction. They forget about orders, don't care how they come out and really are going to take a good investment and ruin it for the manager owner. Try another place if you can help it.",1
"I love this place. The tapas selection was so yummy I couldn't decide. Omar, our waiter brought my husband I his choices. OMG absolutely perfect. First was bacon wrapped dates. Then pil pil shrimp, oxtail, a little later was ahi tuna tenderloin with Brie. Jalape u00f1o margaritas are a must have and the sangria is heavenly.",2
"Used to be my favorite place to eat in Vegas. We went for the first time in a couple years and everything was different. They took a fantastic unique menu and condensed it to a much smaller menu constituting of the same ordinary menu items you'd see at any other chain. If I wanted to eat that crap,I would have went to chili's. RIP Sugar Factory",1
"I absolutely love this place! We've been going here for years now. The food is so delicious and the employees are always friendly and nice. We especially love the beef chimichangas, fish tacos, enchiladas, and taquitos. But from experience you can't go wrong with anything you order. We usually call ahead and pick up our food. Don't forget to ask about their specials.great deals with those.",2
Called in store 10mins ahead of time to make sure they are still serving clam chowder and told them we are coming just for that double checking they have enough. when we get there it was out! and told us we should've order it on the phone.hello? Why the guy didn't tell us we could've done that! Very disappointed.,1
"I have had difficult experiences my last three times here. First time they forgot an item I had ordered, they were very apologetic and offered a free shake which I appreciate but did not accept. My second time their diet coke was not working. Most recently they were out of large cups. In all these are not huge problems, but it seems like whoever is running the place is letting it fall apart.",1
"Stoped by on Sunday night, only two tables in the place bad sign. Harried fustrated waitress ordered a beer out of stock, second choise out of stock nasked for Chutney out of stock, ordered lamb kebob out of stock! I am seeing a trend here. Had three entrees they were ok I really wish there was a great indian place in Scottsdale any recommendations? give Al Ham nra a skip",1
"A cute tour, but a bit too much on the schlock and and pretend and a little light on real history. It was very cool seeing the streets and houses that used to be above ground, but I wished for more time and more light! to see things and more explanation about the history and how they figure things out.",1
"Was definitely not impressed. I ordered the 70 bone in filet, cooked medium, and it came out well done. The 20 filet mignon at Outback is a better quality. The mashed potatoes were good but the meal was clearly not worth the price or the fuss. The atmosphere was nice but the restaurant was nearly empty on a Sunday evening during prime time.",1
"Horrible! Waited in line to pick up ppd a full size car I reserved on Priceline. 1st tip.NEVER use priceliine! 2nd tip check the mileage before you leave the counter. My car had 63,000 miles on it. Never had a rental car with this many miles whether rented for business or pleasure. Hertz is the wortz! Going with Enterprise again in the future.",1
"This used to be a really cool swanky casino this looks like it's lost it's Flair, Glitz and Glam is gone it shows a lot of wear lot of fade it's just not what it used to be I'm very disappointed and sad to say I probably will not be returning but again that's just my opinion maybe you still enjoy, I was stick with the Wynn Resort Casino it's the only five star stay, And never settle for less.",1
"Ambiance is to die for, servers were very nice, food was awesome, so there was really nothing to not love. nI saw other reviews that said service was slow but we ordered and had our food within 20 minutes! Potatoes are awesome, but I don't think you can go wrong with any food item. Come because life is better at the beach",2
"Pretentious and overrated. Also overrun by hipsters but its location sort of invites that. The few times I've been here, the staff was super slow and forgetful. Food wise, I've had better tacos from street vendors for less money. After hearing people RAVE about this place, I was really disappointed.",1
"Very bad customer service! They made me wait a whole hour no joke for a simple 3 min transaction. .i had to beg the lady who by the way, helped someone behind me in line, first . I noticed everyone working there has a snails pace, there was definitely no sense of urgency even after seeing a line building up.never going there again. .i hope you don't too",1
"The food here is pretty good. There are a lot of toppings for your salad and you can build a pretty good salad. The premium toppings aren't really all that premium though and cost a decent amount more. There is a decent selection of soups, but they only usually have a few other hot items. The whole point is the salad though and it's really good.",2
This location tends to have problems with the food. A lot of times I will have to wait for a new batch of food to be made because what they have kept under the heat lamps for who knows how long needs to be replaced. Typical Panda store. Considering the competitioearby I am surprised they stay in business here.,1
"I like this airport because if you want to do some last minute gambling on the slots this is the place. While you're waiting at the gate for your plane to board there beholds the slot machines and your hopes of winning a jackpot. Bathrooms are clean and when I've gone to visit the airport, there aren't that many people. This means quick security lines!",2
"Not sure how I've missed this place but I'm so glad to say I won't be missing out anymore! It's right around the corner from our new school. I didn't notice right away, only after I saw someone else going in. They have a great mix of normal flavors to some very unique flavors that I couldn't bring myself to try.and.you guessed it.homemade waffle cones!",2
"My girlfriend and me decided to have dinner at SEA and enjoy the Thai food. She ordered a sort of crunchy salad greens with fried seafood and I ordered fried rice with pineapple. nThe salad was so spicy that she was not able eat it hot!, burning! . The pineapple in my fried rice was almost non existent. nQuiet environment and reasonable prices but we did not like the food.",1
"I know Kazu is the place to go based on Yelp reviews, but needed a place that takes credit cards. Leaving tomorrow morning and didn't want to deal with the cash thing, or the long waits. This place did not disappoint. Ramen was fantastic. Char shu was tender and flavorful. Karaage was crisp and scrumptious. Friendly service. Great last meal in Montreal.",2
This place is not the greatest. Music is so loud that the people in your own table can't hear you. The selection of sushi is not the greatest. 80 of it have tempura shrimp. The minimal raw fish was not fresh and it was extremely fishy. The cheesecake they have for dessert is frozen. Not a good experience. Choose a different place to eat!,1
"2nd time here in a row for the UFC fights. Sitting on the patio with 3 girls working, and not a single one asks if they can get me a drink in almost 2 hours. I'm use to a 100 bar bill when I go watch the fights, but now I just drink before I come and don't have to worry about them taking any of my money.",1
"Pattie is the best. She is so professional, and she clearly loves her job and loves animals! She has been so great coming to our rescue twice with very short notice when we needed someone to watch our Boxer for a few days. She sends updates and pictures, which is so great when you're away from your pet. We love critter sitter!",2
"Pasta is quite good ""Service is good . But I didn't like the fact I saw the cook ! Touch the fettuccine with his Bear hands . When I ask why? Employee response was! they're going to put it in hot Boiling water to take out any germs. Not sure I think that's was a good Answer . Still he was polite about it. And I'm glad he didn't have an attitude.",1
"So very happy with Petiquette! nI was a first time customer with my young, male, long hair cat. Needless to say, I was nervous! The owner brings his own cats in for grooming so I immediately felt better. nSuper nice folks working here my cat looks great! nHe wasn't upset or anything. I will definitely return.",2
I have been here now a few times and love this place. nIts nice that Fremont Street has some new places to wander through. nMy son is really into the movie Cars all the cars that are in it. Of course many are hard to find but they seem to be able to find them here. nIts a great store. I hope it is around for awhile. I know I will be back again soon.,2
"It is a brand new location on the Strip, so it is clean, nice and spacious, but SO overpriced! 4.55 for a tall cappuccino are you kidding me?! And no free refills with the gold card membership now, that's just sacrilegious. I paid 10.17 for a cup of coffee and a toasted bagel and my fingers just wouldn't let go of my credit card I guess this is Vegas, baby!",2
"the WIFI here has been down 2 of the last three times I've been here over the last month. I'm using the my hotspot on my phone in a coffee shop, imagine that. If I can't get WIFI I can't work. If I can't work, I can't go here. Reply to this review when the connectivity issues have been resolved and I'll start going there again. Thanks",1
"don't usually go here but I was a in a bit of a bind. needed a haircut quick, reserves purposes. and my usual place was closed. I tried it and tried to explain the haircut before, during, and after. hairstylist continued to cut it her way. didn't really like it but it was to army standards, good enough for the weekend. for what they charge, not worth it. won't happen again",1
Nice place with a good American pub feel as opposed to being yet another want to be English or Irish pub . Big tables for large groups and nice big flat screens to watch sports games. Probably the best selection of beers that I've seen on the east coast. If I'm ever in Charlotte again I'll definitely be stopping by.,2
VERY DISAPPOINTING. 2 genos famous sandwiches. There was maybe 3 tablespoons of meat on a terrific lg roll. Combined all meat on half of the sandwich and was barely enough to call a sandwich still. Onions were big chunks and they were raw. Not worth 7.00. Been open for a month. No excuses. We will try one more time .,1
"Eh. It's an out of the way, hidden cafe with patrons from the corporate offices that surround it. If I worked in the offices around baguette cafe, I'd probably go back since there's nothing within walking distance around it. But I definitely won't make a trip there for lunch or breakfast. The food was decent, but nothing memorable.",1
"Wow. I get a pizza here almost every Friday night and the pizza has always been good and the employees always pleasant. But tonight, I was treated so rudely on the phone by someone who said he was the manager that I will never go back to this store again. I bet they see a huge Dip in business with this guy running things.",1
"Well, just left full and happy on an AZ Burger beef burger with green chiles and the pulled pork sandwich. Both were good sized and flavorful on a good quality bun. Delicious, cold seedless globe grapes as a garnish. We also each had a pastry, and thought they were quite good. A great spot for brunch or lunch.",2
"I had a nice lunch here today. Despite arriving at 12 30 smack in the middle of the usual lunch rush hour there was no waiting. The waitress was friendly, and the pizza was pretty good I went with the classic pepperoni . I haven't been to one of these for well over a decade, but I doubt it'll take me that long to return.",2
"Eek! 'Methinks not' is right. Pretty good service, but let's just say that I've tasted better. Much better. The Ronin burger was MUCH too sweet. I couldn't even taste the patty because of the overbearing sugary flavor of the caramelized onions that flooded the burger. What a letdown. A few words of advice. Don't get the Ronin.",1
"I like the Bistro for what it is. It is a much better workplace cafe than others that I have experienced. Bfast burritos are a solid choice. They have Thursday Chef's Table specials that are usually very good. Prices are fair and Gaston, Cindy, and Yadira give great customer service. They should offer bfast pizzas every day, though!",2
One word. RUDE! He asked for my payment and I showed him my groupon. Apparently he was mad because I called in my order and didn't mention the groupon. Then he proceeded to tell me that the total did not include a tip. And to top it off the just shy of 25 for a large pizza was totally not worth the price. I'd rather order from a large retail chain than support a rude business owner like this guy!,1
Very very disappointed in the fact that they have discontinued several of their salad bar prepared salads. I loved their southwest lentil salad and the mediterranean orzo salad. The lentil salad is gone. And the orzo salad has changed. Not in a good way. SO that's what used to get me there and I would wander around and end up spending 100. SO now no reason pulling me in. They have lost my .,1
The food was very good. The fries were a bit too salty though and my meat was too cooked to be called rare as I asked. Also we were in the terrace as the view is amazing facing the Bellagio. It was cold and the server didn't switch on the heater even after we asked him. nGood restaurant not to expensive !,2
"I travel frequently and this was by far the worst service I have ever had. 15 minutes after I was seated a waitress finally acknowledged me. Another 5 minutes passed and she asked if I wanted ""sumpin to drink "" took my order and promy let me know she was going on break and to flag down somebody if I needed ""sumpin "". Go somewhere else ",1
"Arrived at this Mobile Generation store in Fitchburg at 11 05am on Wed Jan 22, 2014. Website said open at 10 00am, sign in door said open at 10 30am. Well, doors were locked and store was dark closed when I arrived at 11 05am. Needless to say, a one star rating for a store that is not even open during open hours!",1
"Finally made to Tacos Atoyac after many months of waiting. In my own opinion, after the wait and all the praise, I was disappointed. Menu items are very inexpensive, but also very small. The food did not taste bad though it didn't knock me out either it just was. Not really sure where all the praise is coming from, but then again, it could be just me.",1
Came here with a friend and ordered an all raw meal. The jicama fries are plain out bad. There is nothing special about them. The raw pizza had an unusually thin crust like a chip and the flavor was not good either. My friend got the nachos and was also not impressed. Hate to give such a thumbs down but gotta be honest.,1
"What happened here? This mall is on the decline for sure, im pretty sure there are just as many vacant spaces as there are open stores. On top of that half the stores that are there i've never even heard of or seen anywhere else. This is a little surprising considering the area near this mall has been upgraded with more popular stores and restraunts.",1
"I don't understand why the bar snack register does not have the candy readily available or on display. The bartender had to leave her station to walk halfway across the theater to get our order making us late for the movie. Then it was quite warm inside the theater, enough to make me uncomfortable throughout the movie.",1
"They just got done with their Kitchen remodel. Food is really expensive. It is drive through food with sit down prices and tip. Food was not season well, portions were ok, they wouldn't honor my full entertainment book 20 discount. Really! In this market you need all the friends you can get. Not a good experience. Won't be back. I would stick with an Eribertos or the like.",1
Love coffee rush! Nice local coffee place. I usually go to the one on Val Vista. Go to drink dirty chai iced. It's a chai latte with espresso in it and the barista here makes the best! There is out door seating and indoor. Cheaper than starbucks and any other large chain coffee joint. If your purchase is under 3.99 try to remember cash.,2
"Very good for a great price AND a variety of vegetarian selections! I was excited, my BF took me here for my b day and we were not disappointed. I could only eat half of my pasty and so we skipped desert. Beers were reasonably priced too. nWe will be back but I am afraid my kids would be scared ""everything is touching "" eeekkk!",2
"Can't go wrong when the casino dumps 50 million into a club. This club can pack in so many people, but what's great about is the outside. There's room to breathe and hang out and I've always had a good time when coming here. Bathroom lines are kept to a minimum and hands down the hottest club in Vegas so far. Cons Long wait if you show up late.go early!",2
"What a joke ! I have never had such flavorless dry chicken and waffles before. I don't even know how its possible to not season chicken and how waffles could turn out tasting as delicious as paper napkins. Could only eat half of our order and threw most of it out. This place has a long ways to go, yikes.",1
"Tao is where me the boys go to let off some steam. Great atmosphere, music is always good. However, if your're not getting bottle service forget about it! Then again every happening club is like that in Vegas We always get the nice table by the dance floor. Probably because we drink 7 10 bottles 0 o?! The staff is top notch, not to mention being totally hot! I guess you get what you pay for.",2
"we LOVE this restaurant, the owner Greg is sooo nice and friendly, the food is amazing we've been several times for special occasions and family dinners, going tomorrow night for my daughter Heidi's Birthday, We're D'Angelo's so believe me its amazing fresh food, you won't be disappointed. Beautiful atmosphere, ask for the table under the chandelier if there's more than five!",2
"Happiness, happiness is a baguette, that you possess. well, a sun dried tomato loaf of deliciousness. Bread should have character, and supporting flavour to any dish slicing bread just defies that concept. But Henri's stocks some marvelous carbs. The rest of it's offerings I have to admit, left me a little cold, but when you have bread like Henri's, what more do you want?",2
"I ate here a couple times and both times were delicious! I like that they open til late since there aren't many tasty places in this area. I had their lychee soju, very dangerous! I could drink it like water! That's how delicious it was. Last time I was there, I had this beef and vegetable with rice in stone bowl, Y U M! I can't wait to go back and try other food!",2
"I am fairly new to town and needed a place to take my Westie for routine check ups. I am very picky about my dog and Az Spay put my mind at ease. They treated him like a VIP! I wish some doctor's offices would treat me that good! It was a little more than what I was used to, but it was well worth it.",2
"I don't like this one much it's too crowded it's even worse in the parking lot good luck finding a space. The lines inside are pretty long, even with many stations open. When I used to live in the area a long time ago, it wasn't as ghetto, but it's clearly there now. I dislike going to this one but my MIL lives in the sunrise area and sometimes we will come here for something out of convenience.",1
Ok so I know everyone loves this place but I don't get the big deal!?! Yes the burgers are good and they have fried pickles but its not better than In N Out! Plus its freaking expensive! I recommend going just to say you've tried it and then go somewhere else like In N Out or Freddy's Custard and Steakburgers!,1
"HORRIBLE I'd recommend yellow cab over these discount is always late. A lot of the time the drivers will show up late and not even at the right place, causing you to have to walk over to where they are sometimes over a block away. And their driving is not much better either how do these drivers not know their way around phoenix!? such an easy and lovely city to navigate.",1
"GREAT! All around! We came in 30 minutes before closing typically anywhere you go you feel rushed around closing time. Our server was great super welcoming and continued to serve us with patients. He never made us feel rushed, he checked up on us always at the right time. The rolls where very different well worth it! We will definitely be back here! I'm glad we found this place.",2
"Rip off! I went here for a business trip and needed liquor for a happy hour. We spent 350 in OVERPRICED Liquor charges. I asked the clerk to split the charge into 3 so we can all split it. Come to find out he charge me twice, I have this in dispute with American Express but they REFUSED to give me the money back even though they admitted to charging me twice. Bad business accumen!",1
I freaking love this place. I love coming to Vegas for Aloha Specialties because there aren't many Hawaiian food places in Cali. But we decided to try it and I never knew how well Island flavor could be done with a Korean taste. Came here the next day as well I wish I could give this place more stars.,2
"I've been to many paint nite events and it is always a good time! Perfect for a girls night out to unwind after a busy week in the office. The best part is that you need no artistic abilities they walk you through step by step and your painting turns out really nice in the end. Paint nite is so addicting, I love it! ",2
"If you're looking for a quality salad with great ingredients I definitely recommend this place. They have plenty of other choices to select from ranging from salads, sandwiches and pizzas I'm just a bit partial to the salads. You can do a ""create your own "" and have some great pesto chicken mixed in as well. Pretty casual setting but great decor.",2
"we stopped here for lunch and got a very nice strip side table for two, we ordered the seafood tower for two for 49, in my opinion this was an amazing value, we had a wole lobster, 4 fresh oysters, four large prawns, salmon tartare which was absolutely delicious, crackers and dips served on a bed of ice with lemon wedges. Such a great meal on a hot day.",2
"Extremely Slow Service! We have eaten here many times and, while the fish sandwich is great, the staff and management have yet to figure out how to manage the tables. This establishment can become quite busy and, if you don't aggressively pursue service, you are likely to wait 20 minute or more just to get a menu. This is particularly true if you are sitting in one of the outside areas.",1
"The view and service at this place is outstanding, probably the best on the strip that I've seen so far. It's confusing to understand how the dress code should be, because i see people all decked out and dressed to the 9's, and at the same time I see people in shorts and sandals. I try to go somewhere in between. Drinks are pretty expensive, but expect that from a high end place like this one.",2
"The big red wagon took myself plus a group of 10 to the Luke Bryan concert and we had a blast! Jennifer was our driver who was so sweet and understanding. My group was drunk and a little annoying towards the end of the night but she took great care of us. The ride was very reasonable, comfortable, and safe. I recommend them over a limo any day.",2
"This is the best smoke shop that I have been to in Phoenix. Mostly because the staff that they have working here are down to earth, very friendly and helpful. They have excellent prices on their merchandise, and sometimes they will even take off a few dollars from your purchase or just give you a great deal.",2
"Not a very ""customer service oriented casino. Walked through, even said hi to some of the employees, most had no response. I do this if employees don't acknowledge you, I figure if they don't care to even say hi, then I can find a place that does. It just presents a warmer atmosphere. I don't think this casino will last, I'm spending my money elsewhere.",1
"Jack in the box is very similar to Burger King quality for probably a much cheaper price. The fries, very much like BK, were actually delicious, but the burger was probably the worst fast food burger I've ever had. There were also a few homeless people hanging out inside this restaurant and trying to hit us up for change.",1
"My wedding is next month in October and I have been working with Jeannie since this past January to find the perfect gown for me. She has beeothing less than amazing! She returns all my calls emails, and is just so willing to help wit htm whatever I need. It has been an absolute joy working with her. Would recommend her business to anyone! Thank you Jeannie for all your hard work and help",2
"Great little sushi restaurant in Scottsdale. Our Sushi was great, along with the appetizers we ordered. Our server was very nice. And the ambiance of the restaurant was well done. A little hard to find because it is tucked away in the shopping center. FYI they do close at 2pm and reopen at 5pm for Dinner.",2
"Very Disappointed on My Birthday! The mgr was Dis Honest and wasn't going to do anything, really didn't Even Care. that I wasn't happy with her product. After several hours she had a change off heart. Dropped off different flowers at the End of the next day a little too late! 0 Stars Given, had to add a star to post review. PMarshall nTempe, AZ",1
"Run! Bugs at this hotel and they aren't even participating in any of the Hilton quarter promotions. First floor has had rooms with bedbugs. Find another Homewood Suites, or suck it up and deal with the awful internet service at Residence Inn. The staff at RI is great and at least they make an immediate effort to make things right.",1
Popped in here for brekky wiv the Missus. She had a omelette and coffee and I had chicken fried steak and eggs and an OJ. Both breakfasts were delicious and the service was great.It was a reasonable price and would recommend this place to anyone. Its where the locals seem to go so you know it will be nice.,2
"This club was pretty small and super crowded, I think table service should be in order if you don't want to stand. Being that we had plenty of girls, it was pretty easy to get in and was offered free drink tickets. Can't complain! The music was good, but way too loud if you are in the middle of the dance floor. We left a little early and went to another club.",1
"We really liked this place, the hand made corn tortillas made the meal, I didn't like the salsa they brought with the chips but when I asked for something hotter they gave us the good stuff. The second time we went they didn't have the fresh tortillas because they only make them at certain times of day. Next time I will keep that in mind.",2
"Tried it once, I'm going back to Roberto's right around the corner. Apparently going through the drive thru at 3PM really pisses off the young lady working the window. The only verbal communication from the cashier was to tell me how much I owed No greeting and no goodbye from the staff. I'll gladly take my business elsewhere since my patronage is not appreciated here.",1
"Why Over Priced! Dont get the chicken in your dish it is so Blaaaaa, No seasoning and on the rubber side.You guys need to season your meat then cook it then put the sauce on! The sauce isnt going to make unseasoned meat taste good.And use chicken Thighs the breast meat is way to dry for this kinda food.",1
"I've been going here for a while, which says a lot because I'm usually a gypsy when it comes to hairdressers. This place is pretty much the shit. Just sayin. Cool salon, fun staff, awesome do's and great prices. It really doesn't get much better than that. If you're on the fence about this place get over yourself and just make an appointment. btw, Amber is where it's at ",2
"Horrible service. I went in there with 5 friends. I cannot comment on the food or drinks because they were out of every drink we ordered and I am talking about obvious liquor labels. No Makers Mark, no Ketel One, no Hornito's Tequila. The waitress acted like we were putting her out by asking for specific brands of liquor. We left after 5 or 6 minutes and will never go back.",1
" CLOSED Sadly, Great China here has closed! O The problem? Too many competing Buffets in the neighborhood, plus they weren't charging enough at 4.95 when it should have been 6.95. The food was quite good here, this is a loss for those of us who enjoy a good Buffet now and then. Well ok, every day or so! ",2
"This Joann's is one of my favorite craft stores in Vegas. I love that they have their own app and have no problem combining different coupons that are on their app as well as in their ad. All of the people are wonderful and always are helpful! I highly recommend this Joann's when going to get craft supplies. Also, I will say they rock when it comes to giving ideas for the projects I have!",2
"Ah, I miss the delicious crispy chicken tacos so much! Shredded white meat, perfectly season, fried in a corn tortilla until it is crisp but still tender and topped with cheese and lettuce. Can't find anything like it in California. Definitely stop here if you're in town. Great service and wonderful food!",2
BUSINESS IS NOW CLOSED! A friend was told some of the staff at the Biltmore Cheesecake Factory that a few staffers from Grand Lux were being sent to the CF at Biltmore and told everyone else that worked at Lux that their jobs were gone and shuttered the place that same day. He said that no one knows why corporate office closed it with NO notice.,1
"Average food. Cheese curds were like an archaeological dig through the breading to find the cheese. I guess bread is cheap and cheese is expensive, but cheese curds are supposed to be all about the cheese! Prices are a little on the high side. House brewed beer was nothing special. I do not understand why people love this place so much.",1
"Wow. Ate here while staying at the Boulders. Great food. Everything we ate was amazing. Food was on the spicy side which I enjoyed! House margarita was one of the best I've had,Very fresh! I highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich on the pretzel bun. We were here during off season do there was no wait.",2
The food is excellent of the items we tried. The prices were higher than we anticipated or we may rate it 5 stars. The staff was prompt and friendly. They had live music by an entertaining Irish gentleman and nice but a bit loud for our 3 month old but that is to be expected at a sports bar grill. We will come back to try other menu items and see what kind of happy hour they have,2
"What I liked the most about this place was the amazing patio! nA dog friendly patio with hanging lights! Beautiful and brilliant! Plus, this place brews its own beer! The food here is good, nothing too extravagant. nHowever, the service is great, friendly and loaded with a very attentive staff! nA must visit for a good time with the amigo a s! ",2
"Excellent customer service Once again Local loaf is one of my favorites, I went in yesterday for the ""chicken and the egg "" and they were out of biscuits so I waited for them to make a new batch, they were so friendly with complimentary drinks and the owner even came out and apologized about the situation and offered me a coupon, the chicken the egg was delicious and well worth the wait!",2
How can this be rated the best Steak House in Vegas!? It doesn't take much to impress me see other reviews but there is nothing special about this Steak House. I ordered the filet mignon and it was not impressive at all. I mean it tasted like dry tender meat with no flavor and not worth the price. I give it an additional star because the service is top notch.,1
" This is the McD's inside the Monte Carlo food court This place gave me and 3 of my friends food poisoning! After losing alot of money at roulette, I wanted to comfort myself with some good ol' fashioned greasy food from my childhood. BAD IDEA. 7 people sharing one bathroom, 4 of them sick. DO NOT EAT HERE!",1
"The most amazingly bad service I've ever received. Drinks are good enough, but getting one in an hour is ridiculous. The staff seemed very friendly, but it's hard to make up for the lack of competence Sr. Management or ownership shows to their industry. This is certainly a one and out for our group.",1
" 10 cover charge on a Tuesday? I know it's Vegas but for f cks sake, that is just ridiculous. Music is ok and the drinks are average. Standing room only and make sure you wear something you don't care about because you will get spilled on. If you are in NY NY hit up 9 Fine Irishmen instead. Better bartenders and live music with no cover charge.",1
"Someday I will have to branch out and try some other things on their menu. But I am completely and utterly addicted to the Stone Pot Bibimbob. Served sizzling and hot, rice meat and veggies with a sunny side up egg on top. Few things in life get much better. Perfect combination of flavors and textures",2
"It's a biker bar. Drunk biker girl had to be hauled off, she should have been cut off much earlier. Do not recommend if you want a quiet lunch. nSeating uncomfortable, decent food, chilli did not have any flavor, pulled pork sandwich was tastey, but the bread was soggy. The cornbread was awesome, beer was cold. nThe server, Adrian, was excellent.",1
"Ended up going here after a really bad experience with another spa. We were seated immediately, asked if we wanted a drink, and received service right away despite being very busy. The chairs were almost all full. The lady doing our pedicures got right to work right away. Would definitely recommend this place to my friends.",2
"They said they would show up between 5 00 pm and 9 00 pm and instead showed up much much later than 9 00. As one other review said, they are terrible at arriving on time. DO NOT USE THEM EVEN THROUGH A HOME WARRANTY COMPANY. They clearly do not care about you or your schedule. What happened to companies that cared about their customers?",1
"Never coming back, unprofessional. nOrdered a cake day prior came for pick up it wasn't ready and they had to substitute ingredients then what they said they would put. Had me waiting for an hour. Could be just baked a cake at home probably. No sense of compromise for my disatisfaction. Got the cake for work and ended being late for work. Disappointed much senor.",1
"Decided to give this a try today. Not disappointed at all. The Signature and Perfectly Peared Bruschetta was very fresh and a great blending of flavors. The Perfectly Grilled Cheese Sandwich was delicious with the spiced pear bread. The staff was very friendly and attentive as was Chris, the owner. Will definitely be back.",2
This place is awesome as everyone says. Great wings and Pepsi in a bottle coke too but I'm a Pepsi guy . The same lady is there every day at lunch and will recognize you if you come in a few times. She's very nice and good humored. I haven't tried much on the menu because their wings are so good that I can't bring myself to order anything else.,2
"How can one not love this part of the Bellagio? It's always perfectly kept and has something crazy, like giant ants or bears that wear fishing garb. And it's right next to a chocolate fountain. Being asked to take pictures is a very likely event people around the world want to show their friends that, ""Hey, that's a giant fishing bear made out of flowers. I am not a liar. """,2
"A ho hum casino and they waste a perfectly good table by offering ""crapless craps "" which gives the house a much bigger edge don't ever play it! Lots of old folks and, well, not much else. Makes a nice air conditioned cut through from the Golden Gate to the Cal if you're not in the mood to deal with bright sunshine. There's better action elsewhere on Fremont.",1
"Close to the house. Decent pricing. Efficient service Its a winner in my book. On top of that, it's attached to a very well priced Chevron gas station with a little convenience store. My favourite feature of Classic Car Wash is that they don't try to oversell you with detailing services and such I hate when they do that but apparently they have learned not to.",2
This company does bait and switch. I went twice for the same car advertised on line the third time I had just left and called to see if they had the car I was interested in and they said yes they had it. LIE.They do not speak English very well and were more interested in getting food from a street vender on a bike.,1
"We come here almost everyday for our business service. The place is usually very busy during week days. But we have never had any problem w their customer service. The managers, all the staffs are very friendly n helpful. They always make us feel great and they take care of us very well every time we visit. I love Hillary. She is super kind, informative and professional.",2
"Food was typical of what you would find in a fusion place. Nothing brilliant unless you are new to some of the dishes or asian food. Went during lunch with a coupon.Customer service was alright, except the manager made some fuss about the coupon, something that wasn't explained clearly on the promotion. Somewhat pricey without a coupon. Will not return.",1
"Absolutely best savory crepes since Cafe' Michelle's in the 70s. the savory crape with shrimp nice size mushrooms, and tomatoes, in a buttery lemon sauce was EXCELLENT! THE BEST! Lobster bisque bakes in pastry puff was bold and rich, soooo good. Service was fast and friendly. I will go back to try new items. Restaurant was founded and created by real chefs!",2
"This is the location where I see Dr. Constantia Abarikwu, MD. There are two sides to this facility the Internal Medicine side where I visit and the Saguaro Family Practice Clinic. I like this office and I enjoy Dr. Abarikwu and usually there is no problem getting in to see her and the wait time is not painful. Parking here is also a breeze, I like the fact that there is a lab on the premises.",2
"Okay, I hate to give this business two stars because I have been a fan since they came to vegas. However, for the past year, my order is either cancelled or postponed for an extra hour because they do not have a stable delivery driver. Really? Hire someone who comes in on time or actually shows up because I would like to remain a loyal customer.",1
"Best Albertson's in the city. The selection is the best as is the staff. neveryone here is awesome, specifically Tracy, Shannon and the gay guy, who's name escapes me, but who is fabulous! nThis may sound wierd, butkeep in mind this is Vegas, but one thing that really sticks out is that there are actual people running the registers. That never happens in this city.",2
"Very well priced hotel in the middle of the strip. My girlfriend and I was able to get last minute reservations for around 130 night, not bad. Rooms are standard, small, no special amenities. Gambling here isn't as exciting as other casinos. Good place to stay for a fair price but otherwise no reason to spend time here.",1
"The bagels are just ok. They don't have much of a selection to choose from. What they do have is not as good as Einstein Brothers in my opinion. First time I went here, they barely put any butter on my bagels. This time was better but they didn't clean the knife before putting butter on my bagels and it tasted like garlic. A cinnamon raisin bagel doesn't taste that good with garlic butter.",1
"This is the worst JiB I have ever been to. The soda machine in dining room is broken, so you'd figure they would automatically fill your cup for you, but no, you still have to ask them to fill it. My mom found a hair in her chicken sandwich. Service as crappy and our food took forever. I will never set foot in this place again!",1
"Always quality, prompt service. Always super friendly. You don't get any weirdos like with Uber. It's always the most affordable. 7 from Oakland to Southside and a 5 tip because these people are super nice and I want to keep Lyft in Pittsburgh. Also in the app at the top there's a slider that you can toggle over to ""Plus "" if you have a group of 6 .",2
Parasol is in a good location. Service is a little slow but drinks are generally good. Their signature drink is pear asol and it's really good. If you want ask them to make it with more of a kick. Overall not a bad place to kill some time but don't expect fast service. They also bring you some chips and nuts with your drink so a nice touch. Drinks are about 18 each.,2
"Definitely not what its cracked up to be. Not the worst if you have to be there for work or business, but microwaved egg scramble should not get 4 stars on Yelp. Breakfast burrito had way too much of it in there too. Coffee was decent. If you don't have to be there, I would wait to get something good outside the building.",1
I was looking for a place to get a stereo installed in my car. After going to a couple different shops I found Elite Audio and I'm glad I did. The staff here is very friendly and helpful and not to mention there great at what they do. Would definitely recommend this place if your looking to do some work on your ride.,2
"I love PF Chang's. I realized I hadn't written a review of the location closest to me after my hubby and I had dinner there tonight. The food was as good as always the great thing about this chain is their consistency. This particular location has great service, too. The only bad thing is that there can be a long wait and it is usually packed due to the proximity to the mall.",2
"It can be loud, it can be busy, the parking always sucks, valet typically required .but n i am never disappointed. Food quality is excellent every time. Bruschetta of any variety is to die for. I love that they serve a little dish of giant green olives in kosher salt with your wine. Kinda like chips and salsa for the Highbrow.",2
"If you like burgers, beer and shakes this nis the place for you. Menu is awesome, food is delicious, beer nselection is good. The only reason for not ngiving this place five stars is service which ncan be improved a little. My favorite was a Big Fat Greek burger. nIf you like lamb and gyro, then this burger is nfor you! Def will be back",2
"As big and boxy as a big box store can get. They do have a large selection and the best prices around. It can take a while to navigate the entire store, but it will most likely save you from having multiple stops on your errand junket. How knows you may find something you don't need, and you may even buy it. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",2
"4.5 stars? Every person I know that has seen this show concurs that it works better than prescription sleeping pills. I no longer have faith in Yelp as statements like ""Money Well spent "" is a JOKE. Caveat emptor with these pricey vegas tickets. After watching Le Reve then this the first thing that popped in my mind was ""tourist trap "". Go to the RedBox, its much more entertaining.",1
"This location always seems to be in disrepair. The machines televisions and listening devices always seem broken or under repair. Staff is much better than before and friendlier, but it is annoying to have to try three machines to get one that works. Even though the rainbow location is twice as far I drive there much of the time. Parking can also be an issue here.",1
Worst barbershop I've ever experience DON'T GET YOUR HAIR CUT HERE. I went there on a Friday and business was terrible the barbers are untrained and this is truly a mom and pops shop I don't see how they've accomplished getting a barber's license the lady didn't even know how to edge a hairline worst place inexperienced and untrained service is exactly what I received don't be the next.,1
"Not only did a drink from this location give one of my co workers diarrhea for 2 hours straight, but they always make the drinks wrong and act like you are asking them for their first born when you ask them to re make it. For 5 my drink better be right damnit! Go to the location inside the Safeway at 48th Street Elliot instead unless you want your ass glued to the toilet seat all afternoon.",1
"this place is awesome, just want to write a quick review. there pharmacy staff is great. my son had really bad allergy and one of the techs. skinny asian young gal with long hair walked my down the isle and showed me what i needed. and got me in and out of the store in a short timely matter. great service!",2
"I wasn't here very long, just long enough to half kill myself walking five miles, loaded down with carry ons, from my arrival gate to the departure gate. Ugh. If you're gonna make people walk halfway across the city for a connecting flight, at least provide some sort of shuttle or something. NOT an airport I care to go through again.",1
"AMAZING! Literally 6 minutes and my car was inspected and I was out the door. I heard this place was fast but I didn't know it was possible to be in and out of an auto facility in less than 10 minutes. Fast, efficient, and friendly employees too! Would definitely recommend, especially if you hate dealing with car maintenance, because it's quick and painless here!",2
"Horrible customer service. I understand the workers are helping customers out, but none greeted or asked if I needed help. I stood there for a good twenty minutes before leaving. I am an iPhone user but this makes me want to leave the brand. I had some questions that websites don't have a clear answer to.",1
"Holy shit. Just tried to order, and right at the beginning I explained that our company would be picking up the bill. So the cardholder wasn't present. I promptly got hung up on, but the person was very kind enough to keep the line open while she yelled at the manager, ""This fucking asshole just wasted my time. "" Thank you kindly. And fuck you, too.",1
"This place is hilarious! Truck Driver breakfast Budweiser in a can, served in a brown bag with a side of bacon. Ha! Holy snickers pancakes! This thing can feed 5 people. The food is so funny but so good. You can pretty much share everything but who would want to do that? Oh and the Bloody Marys are totally insane. Only go here if you are starving!",2
"Just ordered for delivery because we live right down the street from it.never will do so again, would rather drive somewhere and get GOOD pizza. Got a small thin crust margherita, and a works deep dish with an order of jalapeno poppers.honestly, all a disappointment. Everything lacked flavor, the dough was undercooked and had no crisp.",1
"Love this store. Their Seafood Meat counters are awesome. Produce dept. is good. Can find items such as FRESH Kale, not bagged, chopped. Even found Blood Oranges there once. Heirloom tomatoes. Yummy! WAY better than Woodmans, but then that isn't very hard to do. The staff are friendly, and helpful. This has become our favorite grocery store.",2
What can I say Carley is an incredibly talented hair stylist. She takes the time to get to know you and listen to what you want in a hair style and color. Her recommendations and colors are spot on. She is definitely a bright stylist and so friendly you feel like family. I'll be back to see Carley again and spread the word about how great she is!,2
"We opted for the buffet. My husband likes to try a variety of food. Which they def. had, I love that they serve Sushi Dim sum Mexican food American seafood. If was a great mix! Only disappointment was when I went to get the nigiri tuna sushi they were out! It is a bit pricey and there is a wait. But that's okay. You get what you pay for! Enjoyed! We will come back on our next trip!",2
"I basically didn't have anything in the buffet that I liked and that includes The deserts. The place looks nice but the food lacks everything just everything. It's bland it's bad even the mimosas that were unlimited on Sunday brunch was bad, did I tell you that the Sunday brunch had nothing brunch related. Ha",1
"Wonderful dining experience. Down to earth, warm, homey service. We got an A 1 waitress and the assisting waiters were just as nice. The baked goat cheese was just fantastic. We also had the risotto with pork belly. Unbelievable. I savored every bite. This is a multiple visit restaurant. We've gotta taste some other dishes that looked great.",2
"I am old school Italian from South Philly.!rst time there yesterday.I ordered spaghetti and meatballs to go.I found the gravy sauce acidy and the meatballs bland but tender.The best part was the bread.Overall add a little sugar to cut the acid from the tomatoes and cook the sauce with additional ""Italian Seasoning """,1
"So I travel a lot here for work and have stayed at Sams Town and some of the lower places but this one is at the dead bottom . I thought I had out smarted my paps and found a better deal and closer place but turned out he had the nicer place farther away for less , Note to self Hooters Hotels is a NoGo nd",1
"Great local pub! Thursday Saturdays are your biggest nights. They offer beer pong every day too which is awesome. Lots of beer on tap and they offer live music on several nights of the week. I didn't have the food so I can't review that, but the bartenders were very friendly and I love the atmosphere. Definitely a place to go check out!",2
The best buffet in Vegas. The hot buttery king crab legs alone gives this place a 5 star rating. I don't think that I ate anything else. I engorged myself with them. Not so good for the cholesterol. My boyfriend's mom is friends with the hotel's food manager so we always get to eat here for free. I use the extra money instead for gambling. CHA CHING!,2
"Would have been three stars only because of the view but then service was very lacking so I kept it at 2 stars. Food is decent but not worth the price. The basics were lacking e.g., water and bread service. The entrees came out while we were still eating our apps. Wait staff didn't know the particulars of the menu, etc. The view is great but doesn't make up for the rest of the problems.",1
"Although Arthur's offers a good variety of options, the service and execution, and wait time has diminished the last few times I was there. I ordered a six inch turkey hoagie, with chips and a drink, 12.00, ugh! The sandwich was brought with no tomatoes and lettuce and they forgot to add the onions I requested. The bread was stale, and after waiting 20 minutes I was definitely disappointed.",1
"They came to my work and replaced my windshield in 45 minutes, while I was working. Their technician Micah was very professional, called to give me an approximate time to expect him and explained everything he would be doing to my vehicle. I am very pleased with the service they offer, including the free window cleaning and vacuuming. Would definitely recommend them and use them again!",2
"As some one on the Paleo diet, I'm always on the look out for grass fed meat. If you add them on facebook you can catch their weekly specials.very worth it. It is a clean establishment, they are very knowledgeable and can help you select your meat for that special meal. Their chorizo is delicious. I can say that every week we usually have something in our fridge from there.",2
"Scott Conant's restaurant, Scarpetta, inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, was absolutely incredible. I had the signature tasting menu and, while pricey, was worth every . The dining experience was just outstanding. Every bite was a delight to the palette. Service was first class. It was a true fine dining experience.",2
Ok the price for 2 for breakfast was over 27.00 without tip. The eggs were not cooked correctly runny when should have been firm. The chicken fried steak was ok not great. Biscuits doughy in the middle. Sausage grave just ok. Will not be going back anytime soon. The service was ok but the food was not really great.,1
"Yeah, came here for a drink with a buddy and got total shit customer service from the bartender. Always disappointing when a spot so close to home has horrible service. I won't be returning and if you prefer a minimum of a smile with you over priced food and drinks go somewhere else besides St. Francis because you may not even get that much there.",1
"Probably the best roof top bar in Phoenix. I highly recommend you sit up there if it is nice out. Must tries cheesesteak egg rolls, deviled eggs with chive truffle oil and the filet mignon with Cajun lobster sauce on fire roasted corn grits. Recently I had horribly slow service there, but the food and atmosphere is 5 stars.",2
"OMG, you have to try the ""Holiday Sandwich. "" It's got turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo, and gravy. It's a yummy Thanksgiving feast slapped between toasty bread. Beware of the food coma aftereffects. Shame though that the sandwich is not a regular menu item. It's only offered during the holidays hence the name P ",2
"I took my friend here to get our haircut and we had the best time! Not only were our haircuts awesome, the staff is very professional and friendly. The salon itself has a hip but relaxing feel. I've tried a lot of different salons since moving to Vegas, but this is my favorite to date. My friend and I will be going back as soon as we can!",2
"You know about their food truck? No? You're missing out and so was I. Let's just say that their Lomito Complete sandwich was orgasmic enough for me to scarf down the entire sandwich. Accompanied with a mint lemonade and Mexican corn, well, that was delicious. I'm waiting for the line to be out the door on this small shop.",2
"I ordered the Crisp Cobb Salad. I like that they make the salad in front of you and toss the dressing. My boyfriend got the Chicken Caesar Salad, both salads were equally amazing! I'm sure Crisp will become one of my regular stops during the week. I want to try their wraps, sandwiches, and pizza's as well.",2
"LOUD LOUD LOUD AND LOUD but the food was not bad, the whole experience was annoying from the hostess having us wait in the isle during rush hour, to sitting a couple practically on the lap of our fellow patrons with children. nThe hummus not great the Osso Bucco left me bored, I should have had a steak. nJust Blah",1
Terrible customer service. Totally ignored by several available staff. Needed three new cartridges for the spa. We're told by a gal in back that all they have is out. Didn't offer to order. nLooks like the place is getting ready to close down. Sparsely furnished. nWe found a great place nearby that was totally customer oriented. Go to NPS pool supply on 90th near Mountainview. They were awesome!,1
"Really glad to see Rudy's move into AZ. I ate there all the time in Austin. They would get 5 stars if they'd add some sides that were reasonably healthy. green salad, steamed veggies, etc. I NEVER eat there, I always get take out since I want some side that won't make me gain 5 lbs. Come on owners. buy a clue here!",2
"It's a dive bar redone in wood. Big deal. Cute, maybe. The service is horrible. The alcohol selection stinks. Bartenders with major attitude. God forbid they have to walk out from behind the bar before a server gets there. I guess we weren't drunk enough to see the 5 glowing stars everyone else does. Blah.",1
I thought the pricing was on par with every other place in the area. nI loved the chairs. nMy gel mani was awesome she even massaged my shoulders while my polish dried. nMy pedi was just as great! nI thought the staff was super friendly. nI also had a coupon and they had no problem with it like the other review I read ,2
"Zip Dang is such a unique store full of awesomeness! From beautiful skirts and clothing, to cool art and jewelry and much more! The owner is super nice and you can tell she has a passion for what she does. I'm so glad there are still independently owned stores like this around, and everyone should visit Zip Dang!",2
"Food a 5, small restaurant and seating not very comfortable and therefore long wait reduced the overall rating for me. I had the Rick's Abodo Rice with egg whites WOW! Delicious. All of the fun pancakes looked really good too. Bananas Foster, Red Velvet, etc. My hubby had the Bacon pancakes. Will have to go back next time I'm in Vegas to try more items.",2
"I should have read the Yelp Reviews first. Gets two stars instead of one because the price is decent and the servers are nice. Other than that, take my advice, spend a few more dollars and enjoy one of the other many scrumptious buffets Vegas has to offer. This place was basically overpriced cafeteria food. Blech.",1
"The food is ok but nothing special. The waiters are rude and didn't really care about the service. We asked about one of the menu on the table, he said it would take more than 1 hour. Seriously? 1 hour to cook Chinese Food. Deep fried tofu 4.25 for Dim Sum was really expensive, it's chewy and tasteless. Really not impressed.",1
"For the love of gawd.what crappy, sub par sushi that is over priced. Lunch cost me and my girlfriend 70, no specials but one roll and the sushi was equivalent to a buffet style sushi at a cheap oriental place. Just to get the taste out of our mouths and get our sushi fix we went to Stingray in Old town Scottsdale and the quality, service, larger portions and lower cost turned it all around for us.",1
After eating at this place for many years I was disappointed at the higher prices after the remodel. I liked the old place more and wasn't too thrilled with the change of market they want. Sorry guys but 23 for a pasta dish puts you on par with some of the pricier Italian places. Rigatonys down the road is just as good for half the price.,1
Norm R. and I just had ourselves a mini UYE and He suggested we share an order of the Carne Asada Fries. We both ate till full. For 6.50 I cleaned the plate. Thanks Norm R. for turning me on to this place! This was a Mexican American hybrid something like Chili Cheese Fries I have had at one of my favorite greasy American burger joints. Only Waaaaaaaay way way . . Better!,2
"I am so thankful for iPro. I have never broken the screen to my phone before so I freaked out when my phone went crashing to the ground shattering my front screen. I called and they met me within 20 minutes close to my house. In minutes my phone screen was replaced and working like normal. Everything was very professional, very affordable, and very convenient.",2
"Disappointed the pool was under construction, the room TV did not work they charge 9.00 to use the internet and still charged a 20 resort fee. When I asked what the resort fee covered they said the half price show ticket they gave us, hmm not so half price. Breakfast at the D grill was great. Excellent valet staff and bellman. Too many homeless asking for money for my taste outside the hotel.",1
"I'll keep this one short because this Madison land mark can only be summed up in a few words. Wisconsin Beer ALL OF THEM , OLD FASHIONS implied , Cheese Curds in the heart of WI.this is a must and classic Friday Fish Fry as a Northern Wisconsiative I have never felt more at home while staring at the capitol from my dining table . DO IT. NOW.",2
"CHARLOTTE DOUGLAS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT nHuge but very orderly run airport in Charlotte, North Carolina. Even with all the construction going on, traffic moved along quite smoothly. Everything was labeled. Lots of little shops to browse through and mini bookstores and magazine stalls to kill time. Friendly service.",2
WONDERFUL PATIO and Service! We just came in for a quick glass of wine and enjoyed our time here. The patio has an amazing view of Camelback and is perfect for happy hour. We tried their cheese and meat plate and were very surprised at the portion they gave for 14. I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!,2
"This review is solely for Boston Cream. This is my favorite flavor at other establishments. I really like the donut, the pie, just everything. However, this flavor? Total let down. It was too sweet and did not have a good cream flavor. Making cream flavored ice cream and adding chocolate does not make it Boston Cream. The effort was there but the execution was sad.",1
"Bogus I used to like coming here until they decided that they would try and be upscale. Now they are just out of the way and expensive. El Cortez used to have that pleasurable layer of grime that you sometimes need when hitting the town. Until I hear that the carpets have started to go a bit threadbare again, I shant return.",1
"I bring them my dry cleaning and shirts that need to be laundered. The next day, they're done by 4, perfectly. I bring them 10 or so shirts and some sport coats and pants on a regular basis they've never lost or damaged anything. Service is always friendly. They do all their own cleaning onsite. Not a long review, but what do you want from me? It's a freaking laundry. Go launder some stuff.",2
I saw so many good reviews on this restaurant that I suggested the resturant to my pastor and his wife. My husband and I met them there and commenced to receive the worst service from the male server in the bar seating area. He had a poor attitude and continually forgot to fulfill our requests. I was so embarrassed. We'll never return.,1
"Love this place and if you get great seating, you have the view to the whole strip. The food here is great! I've asked for certain rolls that I have eaten at their SoCal location, and they were happy to make for me. Servers are attentive and the sushi chefs are all entertaining and friendly. Quality is always above and beyond, no complaints!",2
"My flight was early and I had prepaid for a 9am pickup. The JERK Charles at the desk who had NO customer service skills at all said ""you'll have to wait till 9 since you prepaid.well, ok, you can come to the desk at 8 50 and we'll let you have the car "". As I write this, I am sitting in the lobby waiting for 8 50 to arrive. Never again! Horrible service!",1
"HAPPENING PLACE! Been here about 8 times, half the time at the centre of attention bar, other times in restaurant or patio. Always good food, drinks, wine, service. Part of the Fox Chain, which we frequent most ly each week. Bloom, North, Greehouse, ect . Always fun, ESPECIALLY summer when bottles of wine are 1 2 off ",2
"Service always not too busy here. We ate around 8 ish at night. The food and drinks came really fast! Food spicy beef chow fun looking dish this was really delicious! ncrispy yellow noodle with veggies and chicken this one was less flavorful, but the crispy noodle was yummy Drinks we got 1 drink each weren't too alcohol ish Bill was about 80 ish",2
"Another disappointment! Saw this advertised the 7.77 meal deal. I'm with a group of 7 let's try it! Well unless you have a ""membership "" it's really 9.99 ok never the less ordered the steak, green beans and mashed potatoes special.steak was tough as a board and we asked for it medium rare NOPE it was horrible! nSorry, don't do it! Gonna keep looking for a good special!",1
"Love this place. Great coffee and great food. Consistent quality and quick service even when they get busy. Surprisingly, they have some really tasty sandwiches for lunch as well. I really like that even when I roll in at 6am, the staff might not be fully awake but they are definitely fully engaged.",2
"Love this place.definitely one of the best spots. The outdoor area with the pools is beautiful. They have cabanas, beds, tables that promoters comped us girls. I've been many times before but our recent experience for Halloween was amazing. Bassnectar killed it and everyone was partying. Love it here, will always make a stop every time we go to Vegas",2
The food is actually pretty good here and it is clean but the issue is the staff. They can be almost empty and they make you wait. They give you a half a glass of water or drink and NEVER refill it. They seem to be way understaffed. The staff also seems to be incompetitant. Interestingly the one at Sunset Station is just the opposite the staff is great but the place is not clean.,1
"I love Salon 42. Erica is fantastic. I couldn't commit in Charlotte to a new salon i'm pretty picky. After going crazy one day and allowing the girl I had been going to off and on for about a year to chop 10 inches from my hair, I knew it was time to get serious to find a new salon. I have nothing but great things to say about Erica and the whole Salon 42 experience. Five stars for sure!",2
Has 2 drive thru but still slow on occasion. I don't eat the food but when I go to one of these places for coffee I expect it quickly. Last time I went they didn't even have large cups so the gave me a small and a medium. I don't even drink a whole large coffee it just seems like they hold their heat a little longer.,1
"Quick getting seated. Friendly staff. The food came out so fast and it was delicious. I got the pollo fondito, which is supposedly ""everyone's favorite "" but I have to be honest, it was good but not the best. My fianc u00e9 got the el crudo and it was great! I'll definitely be coming back to try other dishes, though!",2
"I have been coming here for years and I've always loved it here. It is by far my favorite place to grab some sushi and hang out with friends and drink. I don't know how long they have had the AYCE, but i know its been awhile now. They never had it a couple years ago. The service is always good when I've been here. My favs are the special d rolls, x girlfriend rolls, and the bacon wrapped scallops.",2
I was excited to try this place out but I was sadly disappointed. The menu wasn't anything too exciting. The pizza was served bland. SMALL PORTIONS! not good for the price! Their famous frozen hot choco was OK. Honestly it wasn't anything too special either. My moms made that before just without the whip. The service is friendly though which made it a star! I wouldnt come back at all! sorry,1
Great place to have sushi and there other great menu items. I go here at least once a month. A litte pricey but the qualify and preparation of the food more than offsets the price. Great place to meet friends and enjoy the atmosphere. The waite staff is very good. Highly recommend you try RA. I believe you will enjoy the experience.,2
This is your quintessential Chicago dog place. They do a great job on all their dogs sausages. We also tried their sliders and Italian beef which were both good also but the Chicago dogs were definitely that thing to get here. I would recommend this place to anybody craving a Chicago dog and sliders.,2
Terrible service. Had an appointment for manicure pedi. the pedicure was nothing more than a feet wash! the entire service polish included was done in under 10 minutes although I was the ONLY one in the shop and the attendant had no other hurry. the same with the manicure. it was fast and sloppy. would not go back to this place.,1
"I've come here several times because my family likes this place. I personally would never come outside of them because I have NEVER dealt with such a rude, nasty staff. There are two male bartenders that clearly hate their job and have no problem taking it out on their customers. It's unfortunate, because I like to to extremely well but tonight my bartender will get 0.",1
"Wow! It's gone downhill. It's just not the same. I order some Carne Asada and Enchilada plate. After a few bites I was so confused. It was so bland and for some reason the enchilada had a weird powder texture. I unfortunately returned it, the server apologized and had it removedfrom the check but no manager came by? So strange.",1
Salon Renew is an incredible gem in the heart of scottsdale. A two woman operation with phenomenal stylists who can cut and color like no others. I'm new to the area and worried about finding a replacement for my beloved hairdressers there. I'm never looking back! So in love with this place! Do yourself a favor and make an appointment. Happy hairdressing!,2
How do you mess up bacon?! Ate breakfast at the buffet yesterday and it was absolutely awful. The bacon was inedible my 8 yr old wouldn't even eat it .hot food was barely warm.mini bagels were hard and stale. Now turned off all the dining options at South Point.too many good places in Vegas to risk another meal is as awful as this was. Not a lot of point staying here again!,1
"I too enjoyed a great night at OMB for the Brewer's Ball. What a fantastic venue I look forward to touring soon . The place is well suited for medium to large crowds and had a nice porch area if you needed to get a bit more breathing room. Love the Mecktoberfest it's very drinkable which is nice for a fall beer, because some can be a bit spice heavy.",2
"Rolled over there for the first time 06 12 2011 and it was closed up, with a note on the door saying the chef was out of country due to a family emergency. However, they will be back! Major bummer for me, but I give them stars for the note, the positive reviews, and good wishes for the chef and his kin .",2
" ""Bar Food with an Upscale Wrapper "". Food was subpar for the price. The wine service was absolutely appalling waiter brought a second bottle of wine for the group 5 of us , poured for a taste, then poured the remainder of the glass into first glass. Did not serve the females first either. There are so many great food destinations in Montreal that this place should be avoided at all costs.",1
"Went here twice and asked for specific ingredients on my sandwich. Three sandwiches and they can't do this. Probably the stupidest people I've ever dealt with in my entire life. That's what I get for asking people who make sandwiches for a living to make a fucking sandwich. This place should be closed down, can't imagine why anyone would want to eat here.",1
"It must have been a bad day when I went last month, because it was terrible! We ordered a dozen jumbo, but at 2PM they had none. We settled for extra large and they tried to charge us the jumbo price . The crab were very small, and were so wet they were a real mess to eat. Crab were not meaty at all and sour in taste! nDo yourself a favor and skip this place!",1
"The common areas are nice but the rooms are a dump. I check in 45 early and was charged 15 for early check in fee. I decided to check out early and they charged me 50 for early departure fee. Internet was free. Stay at the Bellagio across the street for the same price, less fee's and a nicer experience.",1
The key to life Mini Mac Cheese jars at the Pizza People Pub! How can you go wrong with truffle oil and bacon Mac and Cheese? This is the brick and mortar restaurant for the Pizza People Food Truck that we have all chased for years! Definitely check it out soon! They took over the old Cheuvront's space on central. They just opened so give them a shot! Our waitress Tonya was awesome too!,2
My wife and I were in the mood for some pho so we decided to try this place out. We came on a Sunday afternoon and the place was dead. The food came pretty quickly. The broth was salty and it wasn't piping hot like it should be. Overall I wasn't too impressed. There are certainly better pho places in Madison.,1
"Thought I would give the sushi a try I know, I know . . . Good thing I got the 4 piece. Spicy tuna and the mango California rolls had too much rice and the filing was bland. And I got a surprise in my szechuan green beans, something that was like a string of plastic. Photo posted I got my order to go, so I didn't find that out until I got home. The service was ok.",1
"We paid for a detail and got a regular car wash. The car even still had footprints on the dash. We brought the car back and they tried to cover it up. I do not trust these guys. A very similar experience happened to a friend of mine too. Paid for an upgrade service and didn't get it, also they push the air filter replacement VERY hard every time you take the car in. There are better places.",1
Not all it was hyped up to be. Service kind of sucked. We weren't even greeted. Then we had to sit in a not so inviting patio. Outdoor seating only by the way. Not so cool during Las Vegas's summer. And all the menu items were just messy. I could of done better at home and cheaper. But I'm sure it would be a great late night dinner afterhours!,1
"Well I thought I would try it and see what all the hype was about, well I didn't see it or eat it. The food was OK ,too many foods mixed and no hash browns . I have had better, the service was bad , waiter took the order and that was the last we seen of him. Its just a place to go to and say you been there. The.food I give a 5 service a 4 . Won't go again",1
"Lets make this easy Just moved here brought them 7 pairs of pants for dry cleaning 6 came back worse than when I dropped them off Took them back Picked up a couple days later, same condition Decided it wasnt worth a third try so I ironed myself nMoving on to another local cleaners for my 30 week in dry cleaning",1
"WaYYYY overpriced! Food is ok nothing to great. The menu was terrible to describe the Chinese food. I ordered the Open Sesame. Was pretty good. The atmosphere gives asian fusion a bad name. If your looking for a place to eat at in the Cosmo, do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else. Your wallet and taste buds will thank you. I will say the customer service was excellent. Nice staff.",1
"Food was alright but the service breaks under pressure. We went for a great night out the celebrate a birthday and had to wait our whole meal for water. Come to the end of the meal and we were given dessert menus, wanted to get shisha, and they kicked us out saying they needed the space for more customers. Very weak.",1
"Every time I come here at the end of the day, this place never has any chicken. Every single day. Which is why I stopped coming here. Why would I go here if you have no chicken? There is nothing else decent to get. I am giving this place an extra star because when they do have chicken, they are pretty good.",1
"Hard to say that ""I'm a fan, "" as this is my mother's final resting place but Palm made the process and planning as easy as possible. The staff was very professional and empathetic, and the ceremony was as I expected it to be. Right now, there are large patches of brown grass especially in the ""Freedom "" area , which I would like to see corrected.",2
Really odd store. I went in to ship stuff for work with a pre paid shipping label but no envelope. Guy at counter said to grab an envelope from the side not a ups envelope but a tan blank one like you'd get at Office Depot. Weird but okay. Then when I checked out they tried to charge me for the envelope. Very odd UPS store experience. Do not recommend.,1
"I normally don't take the time to write reviews, but this was such a rippoff I feel obligated to say something. The food was not horrible, but no where near worth 20 per person let Alone the 30 per person they were charging. The other resturaunt at Planet Hollywood were very nice but this was a waste of time, money and the chance to eat a nice meal while in Vegas.",1
"Do you like cider? Do you like wine? If the answer to either of those questions is ""yes, "" or even possibly ""maybe, "" you should check this place out. I was given their apple cinnamon hard cider from a close friend I couldn't be happier. Discounts on refilling my growler, and delicious alcoholic beverages galore. Go there. Give them business. You won't be let down.",2
"This place was recommended to us as a Pittsburgh attraction and we were not disappointed. I had the strawberry hot cakes and they were amazing. Not too sweet, tender with perfectly crisp edges. My husband had the day's special a chorizo hash. It was spicy and very fresh tasting and along with 2 eggs made for a very large meal.",2
"Great food, excellent service, got in right before the dinner rush.it was allllll good. Calamari and jalapenos left me wanting more and top sirloin was excellent. My coworkers agreed. I actually liked this location a million times better than in Markham, ON toronto where I first found this restaurant chain. Thanks Chandler!",2
Any local spot who knows Tobin James product is alright in my book! I'm glad we were introduced to Terroir on a quiet Saturday night. The atmosphere was intimate and casual and the service was the best I've had in a while. Everything we ordered to snack on was great as well. I would recommend the Lavosh.,2
The hostess sat us at a table that is designed to expand to the table adjacent to us for larger groups. We sat maybe 20 inches from total strangers with his toddler. Both were quiet but just too close. Made me uncomfortable for the whole duration. Food was quick and I'm a fan of Denny's anyhow pancakes . The carpet was quite dirty which makes the whole place seem dirty. Just an observation,1
We have eaten there twice. Once for breakfast and once for lunch. Both meals were very good. If you like French toast order it here. It is fabulous and HUGE! The restaurant is very clean and the staff is nice and always have smiles. It's nice to have finally found a good place to get a quality breakfast.,2
"Wow.really disappointed! After reading such stellar reviews thought I was in for a real treat.nothing could be further from the truth truly awful tacos. nsalsas gringoesque.over priced drinks.horrendous sides salty pintos too nsmall cucumber salad . Eager staff, but not well trained. This is the kind of nplace Seftel will rave about.sorry, this is strictly ""turista ""!",1
"When it comes to quick, reasonably priced Mexican food that's open 24 hours, only Roberto's Taco shop comes to mind. There are quite a few locations all over town but this one happens to be the closest one to me. Some of my favorites include the California burrito, carne asada fries and breakfast burritos! Good times for Roberto's. or shall I say buenos tiempos!",2
I am not from Vegas. been to Vegas about 1000 times and i caever get enough of this place! i would eat breakfast here everyday if i could! nThey say a word of a great place travels far. i say its true! nHealthy creations if you are into the health kick or the good old traditional menu and great creative items. cant wait to come back!,2
"The appetizer caprese with the fresh buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto de Parma, beautiful tomato and basil was fabulous, the serving was large enough for 4 people.Pasta bolognese and pizza funghi was also very yummy. Our waiter Brian was a 5 star, he made our whole dinning experience complete. Looking forward to going back again!",2
Great customer service and always has everything in stock with a wide variety of options. Only down fall for me is that the check out process takes a long time. Their system that they check out is super slow since it's not a bar code system or the workers are lethargic and not really in a hurry to speed up the lines. I'm definitely going to be bringing my business here.,2
"So as the current Duke of Press, I feel obligated to speak on this local gem. This is my daily fix. From Coffee to fresh brewed Iced Tea and the best Cappuccino Ive had, Press is fantastic. The staff is always friendly and super knowledgeable about what they serve. The valley is lucky to have a homegrown business like this to call its own.",2
"Raspberry Brioche French Toast for me. sweet and delicious breakfast for dinner works! Meanwhile, across from me my Dad ate really good homemade meatloaf with mashed potatoes a enormous portion and it too was super tasty. Yes this is basically the ""coffee shop "" type place in the fancy Bellagio But we found it to be a great spot for dinner.",2
"Im sitting in Caribou right now as I write this review! I enjoy this much better than any Starbucks in the city. Nice staff, leather chairs, and super fast wifi. The coffee is good too. Im not the biggest coffee connesieur but it tastes good. It is kinda hidden in the Bank of America Plaza so just keep on walking passed Sbarro and the other shops an",2
"Paradise continues to surprise me with their healthy, smart sized offerings. This time it was for breakfast and I had the Mediterranean but requested it on their whole wheat bread instead of the ciabatta which they were happy to do . Light roast coffee tasted a little off but when staff was notified they began attending to it right way.",2
"Disappointing. Used to be really good, but my food came out with no heat. Not cold, but like it had been sitting for a while. Coffee was watered down. They remade the food, and it was better, but no apologies, no acknowledgment about the problem. This is not the same great breakfast restaurant it used to be.",1
"Great experience with Joseph Maridon, Jr. He got my ticket changed to a parking violation and reduced fine! He is very helpful and responsive to questions. The process is easy through his website, especially since I don't live in Nevada. Hopefully I'll never have to use his type of services again, but if I do, he'll be person I call.",2
"Pretty standard American Chinese food. Nothing special. Went here to pick up dinner for the fam. The young girl behind the counter was nice, but there were 3 older women in the kitchen which is completely visible from the register who were yelling at one another in the back and fighting which was completely awkward uncomfortable to sit thru when I was waiting for my order.",1
"VERY VERY good froyo place! I love that you do it yourself but mixing your own flavors and topping. 0.47 ounce makes it a bit expensive, especially when you have no idea of weight as you fill your monstrous cup. I ends up with over a little over 12 ounces. X opps! The strawberry banana was the fav as I'm not a super tart girl.",2
"I am not sure what other reviewers were dealing with but every time I've been here I've been helped and with speed. For granted, I never actually received my washer dryer bought on Black Friday for new house, didn't get that bid and bid I did get was on house with washer dryer . Both managers Shani and Angie helped with the return even though the normal return time had expired.",2
"This is my favorite place to stay when I'm in Vegas. I've only stayed in the 1 Bedroom suite and it was amazing. I got a corner room so I had a strip view and a view of the snow covered mountains as well. The layout of the suite is great, with a large, fully functional kitchen. Everything about the suite just screams WOW. Cant recommend staying here enough.",2
"I had the good fortune of meeting Bill and Cody when I needed a car and I couldn't be happier! They were honest refreshing in the used car business and genuinely cared about me and my auto needs. They also found a way to finance my purchase even though my credit has not been the best lately . If you want a fair deal and to be treated with respect, this is your place!",2
"Beer braised pork shanks in cheer wine BBQ sauce where have you been all my life? Unbelievably good. The pork is tender and juicy, literally falls off the bone. The Korean BBQ lettuce wraps are also amazing. I ""discovered "" these treats at a yelp part, so can't say much about the restaurant itself, but if everyone is as nice as the folks working the party then it must be an awesome place. Awesome",2
"It's average Indian, not bad. Flavor was OK for the tikka masala and the goat curry. Naan was very disappointing more like pita bread thaaan. I would give the food 3 stars. However, for what you get, it's pricey, so I knocked off one star. I would not be going back there because I can't justify the price for what I get in return.",1
DELISH! Really fantastic meal! BF said it was def one of the best steaks he's ever had! I had the stuffed salmon it was good. ITS ALOT OF FOOD. the only downside was the waiter reallllly realllly pushes the very expensive wines. but that is his job and he does want a big tip so i understand. everything was fab! all the desserts were great as well!,2
"This place is way too expensive for dry cleaning in Phoenix. I also live in Los Angeles and I don't even pay these prices there. Dry cleaning services are pretty standard from location to location, but they seem to think they can charge outrageous prices for their services. They are nothing special and I won't be back again until they lower their prices.",1
"This is the worst Walmart ever! I've started shopping exclusively at Winco and unless its an emergency, refuse to come here. Never enough cashiers, never can find an employee EVER, no one is willing to help when you finally find one. Things are not organized here either. Would give zero stars if possible to post that way",1
I'm urging people to avoid this place at all costs. My daughters and I ordered a pizza. It was terrible. A frozen pizza from Smith's would have been better. The service was as bad as the food. The server seemed to go out of her way to avoid us. Then she overcharged us the manager had to make corrections to the bill. There are many good restaurants in the Henderson area. This isn't one of them.,1
"I tried this based on the Yelp reviews a few months ago. It was a good choice. I usually get the baked, while my wife and kids get the grilled. It has been great every time. The owner and employees are what really make the place. It has a true mom pop feel to it, which is something lacking in Las Vegas, especially in this type of establishment.",2
"The food had a good taste, but the pork sandwich I got was as much fat as it was meat. My stomach was upset the rest of the day. And I thought it was kind of ridiculous to charge 8 for a sandwich that comes with NOTHING. Who sells a sandwich with absolutely zero sides? Probably won't go back too many other places that are better value and more edible.",1
"This place never disappoints. Since it's a chain, 1 review is pretty much going to be like every other review. All I can say is this THEY NEED TO GET THAT HAWAIIAN PULLED PORK SANDWICH ALL YEAR ROUND cause that's my favorite sandwich but it's only available for the summer starting in July plus they have sweet tea which is a huge bonus",2
"Very disappointed. It seems that the stylist has a sale quota to meet and are constantly trying to sell you products. I was there for a color and cut, it took her 2hrs and was constantly interrupted by answering the phone! Did not care what I wanted and gave me a cut much shorter than I had requested.",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Encore Wynn Hotel. I also enjoyed and highly recommend Le Reve show A must see . Great service, breakfast buffet. Decor is nice, however, they don't have enough storage space in the rooms. I thought they would at least have an amoire considering the size of the King suites. I like the fact that it is away from the congestion of other hotels.",2
"We love Pintxo and it's wonderful menu of pintxos it's Basque, not Spanish . The beef cheek was ever so tender. And the Foie Gras is always wonderful and melts in your mouth. The service may be slow and the only reason that I didn't rate higher. It really is as good as it gets, if they can get it to your table more consistently.",2
"There's not much to say about this place. me and my two friends stayed here on a thursday night for 30 bucks. i'll just say you get what you pay for. small room, small shower. the place looked gully, and it almost looks like you're gonna get mugged if you walk to your car. i wouldnt stay here again, ever.",1
I actually want to review the one in the Hilldale mall i've never been to the one on state street. Fantastic art supplies great UW apparel. Decent book selection. Does a great job of highlighting books by local authors or about local topics. Staff willing to find track down and order anything you want.,2
"They get 1 star, because it's the only way to write a preview. Lord, if I did not need medical supplies before the call I sure need them after the call. Oh my goodness, rude , they could not understand the issue. They keep charging me for items not received or wrong items. If you don't have to deal with them please save yourself grief and stay away",1
"Really not great. My family loves Chinese food and they weren't impressed. Beef with broccoli was a little pungent, fish sauce I get, but this wasn't it. Mu shu chicken was downright bitter. Very disappointing. Kung pao was decent, passable. We would have really liked the wonton soup if the winging weren't soggy. The service was very friendly but we will look elsewhere for good Chinese food.",1
"While I am not a big fan of the frozen hot chocolate think glorified Frappuccino , the sundaes here are delish, as is the ridiculously overstuffed grilled cheese. Definitely recommend sharing both of these or anything here, really , as you will be lucky not to keel over of a heart attack on the spot even eating half of each.",2
i would say this place is pretty good. granted it was a monday night but i was almost the only other person there. i ate at the bar and the bartender was very nice though. the fajitas are so so but the special margarita was pretty good though. I will have to try on a more popular night to see if it is fun.,1
"We had a great dinner. Service and food was fabulous. Staff was over the top friendly and helpful. I don't have much Indian cuisine experience but my friend does and we both loved the food. The restaurant decor was comfortable. The only negative was the lighting could have been a bit dimmer, too bright. Otherwise we will return.",2
"Wow, people were not kidding about the horrendous service here, or the incredibly high noise level. The teriyaki chicken was pretty awful, though the happy hour shumai and tempura were okay. The easiest requests are not entertained choosing flavors of mochi ice cream thank goodness for Haagen Dazs . Way overpriced too, and I won't be back.",1
"Went on Sunday night for jazz and blues open mic night. Saw several singers and a impressionist. All were great. You never know who will show up. We saw Phil Flowers, and Queen Aries, so entertaining. The desserts were the bomb. Homemade banana bread topped with ice cream, Hugh portions. Can't wait to go to a other venue.",2
"Although this place has the friendliest staff I've encountered at a barber shop, the cut I received was short of okay! Great friendly atmosphere and some funny barbers to chat with. Unfortunately, I do not see myself returning due to a not so nice haircut and a price that shocked me when I reached the register to pay.",1
"I have been here many times and always am impressed with the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. They get some great national tours of Broadway shows and the ticket prices are pretty reasonable. The top balcony is a little scary because it is so steep, so splurge on the orchestra seats if you can. I went to see American Idiot Tuesday night and loved it! The show was upbeat and well performed.",2
"Updated from my previous review. I agree with the other groupon visitors. Wednesday night during Spring training and place was empty. One person working besides the kitchen. This place still had a Christmas tree in the middle of the restaurant. The food is subpar. It appears the owner has given up on this place, avoid going here.",1
"Everything about the meal was excellent. I ordered the surf and turf which was amazing and my date ordered 2 pounds yes, TWO pounds! of crablegs and oyster shooters. Everything tasted absolutely amazing. Service was amazing. Atmosphere great. Definitely 5 stars, nothing to complain about. Tip Be prepared to drop some though! Well worth it though!",2
"How can I give you good reviews, Aloha Kitchen, if you no let me in?! They don't open at 8 even though yelp and their doors state that. They open and close whenever they want. Here at 815 and they told me they'll probably open in an hour. She told me this WHILE posting a sign that said ""closing at 2pm. "" From the check in tips, looks like an ongoing problem. Boo.",1
"Handy place to meet a friend, being right of I 10. We had a good meal and enjoyed a big booth that gives some privacy and break from all the noise. Food is good and the service is what you might expect from a glorified cafeteria. They do have bus staff that are very friendly. And a free cookie with any sandwich!",2
"One of my favorite places to eat. I've been here often enough, quality of food and service is always amazing! Explore there menu you cannot go wrong my favorite appetizer are pork belly, crab and shrimp, octopus is really good. Steaks are never disappointing right temperature and oh my Lamb the most delicious Colorado lamb ever! And make room for the apple crusted dessert yum!",2
"I love total wine. Everything you need to make educated choices. I love the way they section everything and offer tastings and classes. There are a lot of places that you can get wine, like trader joes or bevmo, but what i like about total wine is that there is always an expert and a chance to learn more about wine, not just buy it.",2
I love burgers so I was really excited to try this place. I enjoyed the experience of customizing my own burger and the drinks were cool. However the actual meat on my burger was a let down. It was thin patty and I was expecting more of a homemade feel. I also ordered it well done but I got an almost burnt tough piece of meat. I was really disappointed. I won't be going there again for a burger.,1
"arena was too big and the equipment was faulty. Went there with a group of friends a year back and there were only 10 of us in the game, i went most of the time in there just looking for someone to shoot. On my pack the sound was out, and I couldnt tell when i was shooting or had been shot. Better options out there, and some not too far away.",1
"Not a vintage store, but a decent used clothing store. Where else in Vegas can you find an Emanuel Ungaro top w tags for 8? They will happily buy your junk for a few bucks, or a few more bucks if you accept a store credit hole and stain free, of course . Also, remember to BYOB bring your own bag , lest you meet the judgmental narrowed gazes of the pseudo hipsters that work here.",2
"Food is discusting. Too expensive for nothing! No hostess, in a supposed to be high end restaurant? The manager looks very stressed and disorganised. Lack of communication between the staff for sure. He seems very arrogant and rude to his staff, a lot of tention there! I dont reccomend that place to anybody.",1
"I had a wonderful time. The place was beautiful and the service was superior. Friendly atmosphere and professional staff. The prices are reasonable, yet you still get the full Vegas life experience. The food is excellent. It's an all in one package here at the MGM. You get it all. n I will definitely come back here.",2
I have to update mostly on the service because the food is still the same amazing haha . They have gotten so much better! A smile every time I come in and they actually check up on me a few minutes after the food is dropped. They are quick on the refills and I'm just sooooo much happier with the service.,2
"I had the lunch special, general chicken. It's as good as any other American Chinese restaurant I had in the U.S. I know this kind of food is greasy, but when I came home and saw the puddle of red, oily substance collecting at the bottom of the rice I decided I had enough. Food was flavorful but never again, they should make you sign a release form for food this greasy.",1
"Food was okay. Service terrible. 10 minutes and nobody greeted or sat me. Ordered drink then 7 minutes later was asked for food order, still no drink. When food came had to ask for utensils and napkin. 18 minutes waiting for change. All this poor service and there were only 5 other guests in restaurant. Very disappointed.",1
"Awesome! 3 visits, 3 different meals, all 3 I would gladly eat again! Waffle was crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside. Comes with meat eggs, sausage links were good. Chicken fried chicken was delicious. Country Benedict was also delicious. Hash browns cooked just right. Even the coffee is awesome. 6 or 7 other menu items I'm dying to try. Place is friendly, well run, clean. Highly recommend!",2
"Nice hotel. Overpriced for amenities and location. But concierge service is terrible. Not friendly. Not helpful. Apparently they Have some kind of shuttle service that noone tells you about.They ""offer "" rental car service and all that means is getting dumped at Dollar rental and then we waited in line for over an hour to get car. Then return car and waited an hour for the shuttle to pick us up.",1
"I recently had drinks and food with friends here. The service was awful! It took over 40 minutes to get my 2nd drink. In addition, they forgot two food orders. When I spoke with the manager he offered to take the items off my bill. I told him I will pay for the items I got. I was so frustrated because I just wanted him to listen to my complaint and he only kept throwing out excuses.",1
"Hank and his crew are awesome! We have used them twice now to clean up our front and back yards. Both times he trimmed some unruly bushes and cut down trees for us. He was great about getting back to me with quotes and times he was available to come. He is friendly and professional, and does great work at a competitive price. I would recommend him for sure!",2
"I read the reviews and thought I'd still give it a try. Not a good idea. The tofu was silken and had absolutely no flavor or texture. The noodles were overcooked. The soup was bland though they did remember to give hot sauce, which helped . The cabbage was the only semi saving grace. Also, it was quick and filling. Not recommended, but not terrible.",1
This is our Friday night dinner spot. Great food and great service. We seem to always eat late with the kids when we go and there is never a wait. We have not been let down once. The entire menu is great. Dining room is cutoff from the bar so you wont choke on smoke and therefore makes it fine for kids.,2
Usually very friendly staff that is always willing to help. So much so that you think something's afoot. No office is generally this nice. Especially in the medical field. They prepared my new glasses in 24 hours. And fixed my old ones so they were like new. Doctors seem competent and staff is genuine. Very small office so things may feel cramped.,2
"I also didn't have a problem with the atmosphere. I found it warm and welcoming and our waitress was very friendly. As a Bostonian, I'm used to being ignored by waitstaff, pricey yet boring food, being deafened by awful music and squawking fellow patrons time and time again. But Nat Spil treated me very well no pretension and I will return!",2
Thursday night happy hour is half off certain appetizers and drinks. I managed to get a real margarita NO MARGARITA MIX and a plate full of tacos al pastor for 8.25 before tax and tip. I was hugely impressed by being able to do this in North Scottsdale and am willing to drive back up there for a second try.,2
My husband is fussy about his haircuts and has had a hard time finding anyone who cuts his fine hair well. I had not looked at Yelp for a barber but did look and found this 5 star place near home. And he is ecstatic about his wonderful haircut. Let alone the reasonable price. He will be back to Eileen again!,2
"One of the main hangouts in SCW for the locals. Not one of my personal favorites food wise. Everything tasted bland. In fact, I've had a lot better breakfasts at a few of the local golf courses. The staff however is wonderful. Everyone was really friendly, and quick, I didn't have to ask to have my water refilled once. Too bad about the food though, or this could be a very good local spot.",1
"How disappointing! After hearing about the concept for so long, when I finally got a taste of the ice bar, I was super disappointed. It was expensive 35 entry fee and tiny inside the size of my closet! You go in, get a drink and come out. You don't even have ice bar stools or ice beer mugs! I would really suggest skipping this and spending the s elsewhere!",1
"The fusion cuisine didnt quite work here. nThe sushi nigiri was all right, at best. nOver priced kanpachi sashimi plates. I dunno, mediocre sushi just doesnt cut it for me anymore. For good sushi I would yelp some hole in the wall restaurants with a real sushi bar, and order omakase. This may sound bitter but im very sensitive about my sushi. ",1
"My husband and I stayed here on an impromptu visit in March. The rate and room were excellent. Loved the jet tub Some key things to note Valet Parking only, resort fee, non smoking hotel. Also, no real restaurant options but it connects through an indoor walkway with MGM Grand. It is also a very quiet hotel.",2
"The service wasn't great, but the food, my god. was. I had the Filet with Merlot butter and I have been dreaming of it ever since. The wine selection is extensive and for that I like as well. The pricing was decent for the quality and amount. I will for sure be back! Tip if you pass up the Mashed Cauliflower. there is seriously something wrong with you. It was heaven on a plate. Mmmmm.",2
"Staff is horrible. Got an eye roll from the bartender when I ordered iced tea. Actually, it was more of a snarl. Got a highball glass full of ice with about 3 ounces of tea. We got moved from a corner where we weren't in anyone's way to a through way where tons of people needed to get by. 1st and last time I go in there!",1
"I can only speak for the pizza, but we found that the pie was nothing special. They use canned vegetables, so the mushrooms were like rubber. Service was good, but considering we were the only family there on a Monday evening, it was easy to keep tabs on our needs. It is rather pricey, so for the money, I don't think we will be back.",1
"the place i have been dying to go! i was like a little kid in a candy store. i literally wanted to buy the whole store but instead i bought a pair of pajama pants that said ""who's your candy? "" all over it and a yellow water bottle. we didnt buy any chocolate cuz we were afraid that it will melt. its so hot down there!",2
I'm sure all the locals in Las Vegas know about Kona Grill but if you are visiting or just moving here this is a great place. Their sushi rolls are to die for. I've never had a bad meal there. And it's a party like atmosphere especially on the weekends. But get there before 5 00 because it gets crowded fast.,2
"I had the nachos with chilli. A very large portion. A good meal. Hungry Monk is awesome because of the large selection of Draft beers. Even a beer from a tiny brewery in my area of Pine Arizona That Brewery . I am impressed. Typical bar set up. Good service. Took a bit to get silverware, yet a fun place to hang out. I will be back.",2
Just had the carpets cleaned and boy can I say there is a difference! My carpets look brand new again There is a difference between quanity and quality. I love how they took their time and gave me quality service. There was NO RUSH! It smells very refreshing as well. I will continue to use this amazing company!,2
I was so disappointed. I ordered a 20oz Rib eye that was flavor less. They had to bring steak sauce.but as we know.a good steak doesn't need steak sauce! The one positive thing is the service. Ryan L made our experience worthwhile. He was super nice and understood my frustration over a horrible meal. Keep smiling Ryan L,1
Clean studio. However Yoga Nazis. Regimented. Most of the good teachers have left. Check out summits or inner vision to find hot classes with teachers who encourage you to listen to your body and not push it.this is not a fun atmosphere for yoga. No more injuries after switching to teachers and studios who encourage modifying and gentle nurturing corrections.,1
"We have gone here in the past year four times and they are always out of ice cream. It doesn't matter the time of day. This last week we went to get ice cream and food. Ordered chicken tenders they were out. OK can we have four cheeseburgers no we are out of buns. Well what can we get, whatever you want. We just left after all that.",1
Ok. I MISS THE OLD WAITERS. New ones look like clones and honestly are sub par to the old ones. The new design good. The ability to Tweek what's on the menu is more of a Applebee's experience. We waited at bar that had 3 bartenders and few customers like 10 minutes before they took order. Sketchy palms crowd equals sketchy staff. Prices didn't change so u all make your mind up.,1
"I have been volunteering for AH4S since 2011.one of the BEST rescues in Vegas. They are truly dedicated to doing what is best for the dogs. I also adopted from AH4S, their foster families are angels here on earth. PLEASE like their FB page, donate, volunteer, support them in any way you can. One single action can save a life!",2
"Room wouldn't heat up past about 60 degrees, which wouldn't be too bad if they gave you more than a sheet and paper thin blanket on the bed. Pretty much had to lean against the wall under the shower head to get wet with the little amount of water pressure. For 50 you get what you pay for. Also, shuttle was late twice so give yourself plenty of time to get to the airport.",1
I am Filipino and can say the food is good! I am not a fan of the main dish served in a small bowl. My lunch was a bit expensive considering the portion of food. I would place the meat On the actual plate and give your customers better portion of the main dishes. Not used to paying so much for Filipino food and the portions be so small. Might come back only if I really had to. Sorry.,1
"Best BBQ in LV, possible the Wild West coast! I usually get the brisket. Had the apple cobbler once. Make sure to get the spicy bbq sauce and Mac n cheese on the side. Wish they really had indoor seating. But it gives a bbq picnic experience. I'm from Texas and this rates among the best I've ever had!",2
"What a great place to go for a tasty treat after the movies or dinner at Norterra. Some of the best frozen yogurt in the Phoenix metro. Great locatioGreat product nGreat service nGreat value Must try's Dulce de Leche, Hawaiian Bikini Martini Sorbet and Pomegranate Raspberry Sorbet! Hope to see ya there!",2
"Yes, I agree with other reviewers they do brew a good cup of coffee. I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I believe that they're coffee is smoother in taste. The pastries in the glass case didn't appeal to me too much. During the summer month, Steep Brew place a vendor at the farmer's market square. They're blueberry iced coffee is a must try!",2
"I have been a patient of Dr. Stacie since she took over the practice. I drive all the way from Henderson, because of the care I receive. They never try to up sale me like other offices have, they just treat me great and take care of my back pain and headaches. I have been going to Chiropractors since I was a teenager and I am now 51. Dr. Stacie is one of the most caring Drs. I have ever seen.",2
"my burger was really dry and tasteless, and I ordered it to be cooked medium. I was disappointed in this place because everyone says its the best burger in town.I must be missing something. I thought the atmosphere kinda sucks and the way seating is done leaves much to be desired.overall might go back to see if it was just a fluke, but wont be rushing there.",1
"The hotel is extremely nice, however the reason for my low rating is the noise from the pirate show at night. This woke me up and the hotel staff were unwilling to assist with changing my room and did not mention this at all. We were told we got a jacuzzi room and just had a jacuzzi tub that barely fit one person.",1
"The fish is fresh and delicious, the portions are a good size, and the lunchtime chef, Rigo is a phenomenal talent. It's about the same price as the Italian place across the street, but in my opinion a much better value. The wait staff is professional, the happy hour specials especially the burger are great. If I had it in my budget, I'd eat lunch here at least 3 times a week.",2
"Awesome service from the ridiculously good looking staff, chic and ultra hip decor outside seating with heating lamps and view of the river . Oh yeah the food tasted delicious! They also make a really mean bloody mary.one of the best I've ever had. I really hope Graze opens a restaurant in the bay area soon since I probably won't be visiting Scottsdale anytime soon.",2
"I saw The Dark Knight for my first IMAX experience and loved it. The screen is about three stories tall and concave so I almost felt like part of the movie. My girlfriend and I sat about four rows back and had a decent view. I would recommend sitting back a little farther. In fact, without trying it first, I would think that you couldn't sit too far back, given the size of the screen.",2
"It's a ""dive "" of a donut shop with scrumptious donuts! Kronuts are the bomb and even the plain are yummy, not too sweet and made in the shop. I got there when they opened just after 6am and they were fresh and warm and yummy. Don't go with hipster high trendy expectancy this is a dive but worth a visit once in a while!",2
"I've eaten lunch here twice now. I enjoy the food, but there are so many Hawaiian places to compete with, it's really hard to separate yourself from the pack. I would like to give Ross J's 3.5 stars, but obviously that is not an option. The place is certainly on the upper end of the scale, so it definitely deserves four stars as opposed to three.",2
"i enjoyed the food to a small degree, some parts were amazing and others were not very appetizing. The service was absolutely not great. That was the absolute problem with this establishment. The waiter was incredibly rude and condescending. I was not happy with that and our table and him almost got in an argument with him. The prices were also extremely high. It wasn't worth what we paid.",1
"LOOOOVE this place, Its open 24 7 from what I understand. Its got great atmosphere and delish drinkiepoos. I think its the last Tiki Bar in Vegas at this point. and its practically new at only a year old . The place is dark inside on the brightest days, so if you are a vampire this is where you could sit.be prepared to get smoky as LV'ers love to smoke it up inside.Grab a booth if you can.",2
Came here to celebrate a special event. Decided on Grotto because of the reviews but couldn't be disappointed more. Rude and disrespectful owner server who was very judgmental. We ended up leaving due to his demeanor and treatment. Want a similar experience? Make reservations and enter at your own risk.,1
"As soon as my husband and I walked in, we knew that it wasn't ""Good Times "" anymore. Kickshaw is completely overpriced and the food is bland. It wasn't that I had a bad experience. it's just that I was disappointed and expected SO much more. I will not be returning here agaior do I recommend this place to a friend. not even a friend of a friend.",1
I paid 125.00 to get my hair dyed. Well I went to get a blow out today at another salon. She told me she thought I had dyed my hair myself because there were pieces in the back that were just plain missed. This really upsets me as 125.00 was a lot to pay and now I find out it was not even throughout? I will not be going back to this salon as I feel really ripped off.,1
"It's a sportsbar, so I know I can't be too picky, but Majerle's could add at least one or two decent microbrews Shock Top does NOT count and they could freaking turn down the awful music mix during halftime at 2 pm on Saturday to sub ear bleeding levels. Great service, though! That should be mentioned.",1
I went in to check this place out when it had just opened. The music made absolutely no sense with the atmosphere. They were playing hip hop music with cuss words in the songs. Unprofessional . The meatball was pretty good. Oh but did I mention they have no ketchup? It's a breakfast and brunch lunch whatever kind of restaurant and don't have ketchup?,1
"This review ultimately means nothing since Einstein's has a million locations and probably makes like a buyillion dollars, but I have to say it, because I don't understand why.I find both their bagels their cream cheese way too ""fluffy ""! Both feel like they have been overly injected with air, I could eat like 20 of them and still be starving, a bowl of rice crispies gives me more satisfaction.",1
I went to kona grill around happy hour and sat at the bar by myself idk if the drain was clogged but the bar could not have smelled worse. It was appalling I initially blew it off thinking maybe it would change then I lifted my arms and my sweater stuck to the bar i ordered a bud light happy hour price was average. I did not stay to eat though could you blame me?,1
"Pleasant surprise. Tried it because it was convenient and will return. Nice decor if a little bright. Happy hour prices are great, but a little pricey otherwise. Server was friendly and attentive, but there was a moderate language barrier. Went as a group of 8 and the chefs kept up pretty well. Sushi was excellent.",2
"I went a couple of times before they changed the name logo,only for breakfast. It was ok. Atmosphere not so good in the main dining. If you can't put out a decent breakfast,I'd hate to see lunch and dinner it was adequate,but not great. And too many gnats,which was a turnoff. I much prefer the little place down the street Mercer's. Clean,friendly,better food.",1
"Overpriced, substandard food, poor service, not to mention the driest cheeseburger I've ever tasted. The manager refused to fully refund the ""Mohave desert of burgers. "" Atmosphere outside looked fun, but I suggest you stay outside because there's nothing but slow service and a ""one trip "" salad bar inside.",1
Great food! The eggplant parmigiana pasta was delicious. Portions are huge. The pizza cookie for dessert was life changing. Like I think I had a spiritual experience while eating it. It's a half baked cookie I got peanut butter chocolate chip which I highly recommend with vanilla ice cream on top dusted with cinnamon. You'll probably wanna share because it's huge too.,2
"Not very good, this was probably some of the worst indian food I've had. I've been pretty spoiled At one point there was something that was hard in my food and I cringed when I bit down. I'm not sure what it was. I'm used to very well flavored Indian food, and the curry was bland. nThe service was good, and it was inexpensive, but I think I'll try some other local places first before returning.",1
"Update I only wish they took American Express! They'd have a lot more business if they did. It has been very hard to find a decent nail salon since I've moved from San Diego to Phoenix but FINALLY I've found a great place! Both Don and Theresa have done my nails and they've turned out beautifully every time. Best of all, it's affordable. I highly recommend them to all. ",2
Very objective and incredibly well written. Deceptively large and packed with with information. Prepare to take at least an hour and be ready for a history that pulls no punches. The truth hurts and so everything from slavery and the life of the poor farmer to the whole lynching dedicated exhibit is incredibly intense and gripping. A great inspiration.,2
"My heart is aflutter for this dive in glitzy Vegas. This is everything Vegas is NOT and well worth the visit. What can I say. World class dive punk bar. Almost as good as the original EXIT on Wells in Chicago.some things better 24 hours and the ass juice rules , some things worse no discernible dance floor . Shut up and drink already. You must must must go here.",2
"I hear this place used to be wonderful, and wished I had visited it then. Last week when I went I found everything oily flavorless. My Pad Thai was grotesque it tasted like they substituted vegetables for lard. As it sat uneaten it congealed into into a solid block. I'm health conscious, so this is definitely off my list.",1
"We came here the other day to celebrate both my birthday and another friend of mine. One of our friends gifted the Groupon. It was pretty hot, but if you come early enough it isn't too bad and you can get quite a few rounds in before you feel like you're about to pass out. This is a good thing to do to help you realize just how out of shape you really are, but it was fun.",2
"In Montreal from St Paul we were searching for an authentic French Parisian food experience. We chose La Villette on chance. The CroBurger choice my wife opted for foie gras was superb. The croissant type bun was super buttery. I had the Feuillantine Comtoise, a croissant dough filled with ham, bechamel, cheese. Excellent! nWe will definitely return. Such a wonderful find!",2
"PIzza was good. Delivery was slow. Delivery driver didn't know how long it took, expressed surprise when I told him it was over an hour, and then he dropped a container of ranch dressing on my front porch. It exploded. He looked at it, said ""oops "", shrugged his shoulders, and left. I will not be ordering from here again.",1
"Just stopped in for lunch today and boy what a shocker. Ordered Hot Tea and it was far from hot. cool at best. Then the Food , all Cool Luke warm and tasteless. seriously people! And there were kids all over the place fingering all the silverware Kids, as in the owners kids . Service was crud and food was crud. NEVER AGAIN! Avoid at all costs.",1
"I gotta say. Bacchanal Buffet is one of the top buffet in Vegas. If you go Vegas without stopping by Bacchanal, then it is one of the big lost that you have. The foods here are good and have more variety , especially the desserts. One of my favorite dessert that you cannot find where else at the buffet is Macaroons. All you can eat Macaroons. Make your money worth while you are in Vegas",2
"If you're a fan of Michael Jackson, you'll enjoy the show. They preformed a wide variety of his music with some nice visualizes. If you're like me and a fan of Cirque du Soleil, skip this one. This show was seriously lacking in the acrobatic, strength, and balance displaces that are associated with that name. It is almost completely a song and dance show.",1
"This place has the worst greek food I've ever tasted. The meat was nasty and tasted like spam, the rice tasted like rice a roni, and the sauce was just gross. On the positive side, the lettuce was green and was as expected. Seriously, the only thing they got right was the lettuce. Do yourself a favor and try another place for greek food.",1
"THT has to be the worst ice cream shop that I have been to. I walked in expecting a varied of ice creams, and come to see that they do not have much to choose from. I ask for the basic flavor strawberry and they did not carry it. The person over the counter seemed confused and did not know what he was doing. I did not even bother to order a smoothie seeing how bad the place looked.",1
"New to Vegas I went here because I knew j had a sinus infection and need antibiotics. The Receptionist, Medical Assistant, Dr. We're friendly and efficient just the way I like it. There were four people ahead of me and I was in and out in under an hour on my way to the pharmacy. Thank God for this place! Thank you very much for your professionalism, sterile environment, efficiency! I will be back!",2
"Oh my gosh, the curries here are AMAZING. nI have tried the mango, squash, and yellow curry. nAnd I definitely recommend the mango and the squash curry. I have only been here for lunch, so I cannot speak for those who had bad experiences during their dinner time. nI do have to agree that their service is slow, but most of the staff is quite nice.",2
"Guys if you gotta hit the mall with your woman .this is the place to go .the most comfortable chairs to lounge in while your girl looks at overpriced, shoes, handbags, clothes, etc grabbed a cup of java, plopped in a chair, did the "" i'm cool texting "" thing and the mall was .tolerable .then again , it helped that we got their late and the mall shops were closing within an hour .oh.darn !",2
Gem in the ruff. Yes it's old very old. Probably like 30 years old. I would come here as a boy with my grandfather. But if you ask for an off the line hand wash they do it the right way and it's fast. Not like Freddie's fabulousness which is just a scam for let me try to sell you everything under the sun. This is like an old barber shop no frills just a good hand wash.,2
"I took my 2014 Altima in for an oil change and they informed me that they won't do a regular oil change but were required by policy to only do a full synthetic change. If I need to do regular abt 3.5K miles changes, I truly don't want to pay extra for synthetic! The dealership doesn't even put in synthetic! They wouldn't budge, so I did.right out of their parking lot.",1
It's fresh and light yet super filling. Taste was delicious and much different than previous FOX restaurants I've been to. Brother really enjoyed the pork filet dish? which came decently sized and filled him up. I stuck with a salad that needed a LOT of work on presentation but their garlic truffle fries definitely made up for it. Also.their tacos for appetizer.fat siblings for the win.,2
"I actually had this saved as a draft and was going to say something nice. Unfortunately I have been back to this location a couple of times since the new management and I don't think I will be going ever again. Service goes a long way, so I will say the food was great, but the service was unacceptable!",1
"First off, food was great. I ordered the Steak Bordelaise and it was solidly cooked and seasoned. Had a little bit of everyone else's food and that was good too. I only had one gripe about this place. I don't know if it was me or because I had one too many glasses of scotch but is it too dark in there?!?",2
"i was there with four other people friday night.The worst food experience ever.The food selection for what they charge was very limited but that was not the problem all five of us agreed that it was the worst buffet we all have been too , terrible selection and very bad tasting food and deserts.Do your self a favor and dont go to the buffets they have great other restaurants there.",1
"Free and fast wi fi. Friendly staff. Delicious house made menu items. Atmosphere is cozy and perfect for getting some work done or chatting with friends. I only gave 4 stars because the temperature inside was a bit too chilly but I'm from Texas so, maybe i'm just not used to it. Still, a fireplace would kick this place up a knotch on my list.",2
"Owned by DJ Vice, it's CRSVR Santa Barbara's sister store. They defintely carry a good selection of vintage sneakers and apparel. Expect to find the Hundreds, Stussy apparel as well as deadstock fitteds, retro and quickstrike Nikes here. Located at the 3rd floor of the Cosmo right next to Marquee. It's brightly lit, with a huge Hundreds sign posted out front you really can't miss it.",2
"The WORST urgent care ever! Rude front office staff, extremely long waits even though it was almost empty and the Dr didnt even let me talk, just wrote a prescription and walked out of the room, he was literally in there with me for less than 1 minute. I will never come back here again I recommend you save your time money and go somewhere else",1
"I love it here! The location by my sister's house closed iorth Phoenix and when she told me about it, I immediately had a craving for Rubio's and was so thankful that this location is still open and appears to be going strong! I would eat here every day and I'm pretty sure wouldn't even ever get tired of it!",2
"When things break around here it is usually at night or on the weekend, usually Sunday. They have rescued every time with everything from no hot water to a cranky air conditioner. They get here quick, they do a great job. They are always courteous and estimates are accurate and honored. They are truly my ""One Call "".",2
"This is a nice clean place, if you're bringing the wife and kids and maybe grandma too. If you're younger or single and looking for a hip party, this is a complete waste of your time. We actually threw away our room and checked into Cosmopolitan mid trip and absolutely saved our bachelor party weekend. It's unbelievable how quickly this town changes. You need to do fresh homework to get it right.",1
"At first, everything was going great. The sea weed salad rainbow roll were both delicious. Then, I ordered the fried calamari. it tasted like rubber with a very slimy texture. Wasn't separated at all just one big ball of tempura. The salmon roll was warm. nThere was a bug crawling around my friends roll and they still charged us for everything. Cool art on the walls but I refuse to return.",1
"This is the most authentic Irish Pub you will find. The food is good and plentiful and the beer selection is impressive. I have been several times to the Ceili dances on Tuesday night, they are a lot of fun, and the regulars are great about reaching out to teach newcomers. There's lots of live music, and a truly Irish ambiance.",2
"Props to Applebee's on 27th and Bell. I went there for the free Veteran's meal. It was packed but they got me in at the bar right away, and had my meal in front of me within 10 minutes. The whole time Courtney and Kara did an awesome job taking care of us all at the bar. Really great customer service!",2
"Not bad, but not very good. First, I why does ""The Keg "" not have any beer to speak of? I was dumbfounded to learn they had three beers available. The service was very attentive and both the hostess and our server were great, but everything else was middle of the road at best. The mixed drinks were poorly done and the food was nothing special.",1
"Not really busy ever. But they got karaoke, fun bartenders, and its a cool environment. They got 1 PBR's which is cool cuz anywhere else beer is 3.5 5 a beer. We had stopped in once and then the next day the bartender let us in like we were regulars. Thats what made me really like this place. PLUS BEER PONG!",2
"Okay, it's vegas and this is basically a chain. That said it's a great place to people watch, as they stoll about the Miricle Mile Shops. We've been here a few times the food is good, although not ground breaking, as are the margaritas. if you go off peak hours, esp weekdays, we've typically been able to get a table along the railing.",2
"Absolutely loved Wicked Spoon. We got there right when it opened so not much of a wait. Love the individual servings. The food taste freshly made. If you're a dessert fan, you'll appreciate Wicked Spoon. Huge selection of desserts. There is less variety of seAfood than Bacchanals but beside that my favorite buffet in Vegas.",2
"I absolutely love how it's outdoors. I love being out in the sun, especially when there are misters to keep you cool. This place has tons of yummy restaurants, a great theater that has student discount, and lots of places to buy cute clothes. They also have a stage where local bands provide entertainment. Being that it's outside, you can even bring your dog. This is one of my favorite malls.",2
"I absolutely love this joint. The bar staff is awesome and extremely cool. Every time I go they comp my meal from my gambling and the food isn't your typical bar food this is a top notch Italian meal! The house salad with their creamy Italian dressing is my absolute favorite. You wont be disappointed, I promise.",2
"Very disappointing. I have been going to Nora's since '94. It has slowly gone downhill from then. I recently had a 8 pm appointment and took a date. I checked in at 7 50 but wasn't seated until 8 25, and then right behind the hostess podium. Good business, as usual, can bring a business down. I'm done.",1
"Just saw the Parma episode of Mystery Diners. While I've never been to the restaurant, what I saw of the owner makes me want to go the next time I'm in Vegas. Chef Marc, you are a good man and a caring owner. If the food is as good as the other reviewers say, then you have a home run. Keep up the good work.",2
"My insurance company suggested Scott Auto Body when I had a little fender bender. Everyone I spoke wit there, especially Nick, were beyond helpful and pleasant to deal with. They were very fast with the repairs and kept me updated throughout the process. I know good car repair shops are hard to find and I would suggest them to anyone I knew.",2
"The only retarded district that doesn't test 4 yr olds. My daughter can't go to school because her birthday is on October. That's messed up, how can you deny a child the right to go to school and learn. Her preschool even says she should be in kindergarten because she knows more them any other student",1
"I'm'a history nut. I really am. So my ex and I went here. And we had a wonderful time appreciating the beautiful architecture, as well as the amazing historical facts posted on museum quality placards and exhibits throughout. I loved it! Definitely a must go for anyone who wants to know more about Wisconsin heritage.",2
i would give this hotel a negative rating if i could. Only gave it a star just because of its great location on the strip. i booked this hotel because my aunts were staying here for the weekend as well. i should have spent extra to stay at the wynn or somewhere else. if you're not staying at their spa suites then forget about this place. it's pretty worn down and outdated.,1
"You can always count on good food here. Their tea is to die for! I have a few favorites here at this establishment. The Turkey Cranberry Sandwich is always my favorite, but it is seasonal, and the Butternut Squash is always the best. When I am not feeling good The Potato Soup in a bread bowl is where I turn to.",2
"Went in for a full oil change and car wash. Cupholders, console and dash were not wiped down and my over active imagination pictures everything else being done as slap dash. Danny really, this is the first thing that a customer sees when they get back in their car! I've been to places where you see them with a brush cleaning out vents as I reclaim my vehicle! Guess where I'm going.",1
I actually followed a bartender to find carmines when she left her last job. I consider the staff my friends and they always have a fun and possitive attitude. Caitlin is the bomb! Their food is great too! As i write this i am craving their shrimp on a stone. I can hear the sizzle now thinking about it.,2
"This place is very reasonably priced and in a convenient locatioext to Albertsons. Unfortunately, the tend to break all the buttons on your clothes and clothes typically come back creased since the don't dry clean in house. Your clothes have to survive the trip from the cleaning plant and during the move they don't stay pressed. However, they do offer same day service which is quite helpful",1
"OverEasy?. . . NEVEREASY!, is more like it. Shared similar experience with those who rated this place one or two stars. Tried it twice, sat in uncomfortable bar stools and watched our food sit and get cold, showed up for brunch just to find out they close at 11 30 AM. Like I said, NEVEREASY, even better NEVERAGAIN!",1
"Good place, nothing much different than any other Flat Top. If you go when school is in session, don't try to go during ""normal "" lunchtimes unless you want to fight with some real crowds.they offer a 1 discount to students, so the place gets flooded. I prefer to go around 11am or 2pm, and the place will be pretty much empty. Go before 3 4pm, though, as lunch is cheaper than dinner.",2
"Middle of road at best. Just another Strip restaurant with big prices and nothing to brag about. Service was OK. Onion soup good but just warm, not hot. Escargot pie nwas over cooked, escargot rubbery. 30 pork chop looked good but had no flavor. nWife's salmon was good. Just A Meal. There are a lot better restaurants at the Cosmo .",1
"Cool place to hang out at the mall. We will definitely be back to watch games and hang at the bar. The garage theme is cool, and it'll be great to hang out on the patio in the spring. The shrimp tacos and carne asada tacos were excellent. portions are big, not those little sample size tacos. Try it out if you are at the mall or looking for a good place to day drink or go for happy hour!",2
"Stopped in today for lunch after learning Taqueria Los Parados has closed. We tried the Italian sub with pasta salad and the eggplant parm with garlic knots. Eh! I make a better sandwich at home. Plus, the bread was soggy from too much oil and vinegar. The eggplant was tough and the sauce was very acidic. Pretty disappointing. I'll stick with Siena Deli on West Sahara for my Italian deli fix.",1
"I had a CD listening party at SideBar and could not say enough about the owner, Josh Parry. His hospitality and accomodation was impeccable, he really went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and satisfaction all with a smile. Awesome service, great drink specials, fantastic happy hour, all in a intimate atmosphere with a great ""vybe "" and positive energy. I will definately be back! Wisdom",2
The pizza is good but the seating and the service leave quite a bit to be desired. Although there were tons of servers nobody seemed to be looking after the customers. You self serve for drinks but are out of luck if you want water or iced tea water is behind the counter and the tea was perpetually empty. I was glad I went with a groupon and didn't pay full price,1
"Based on the reviews and the article in the magazine I expected to have great tasting pizza. I loved that it was thin crust but when I got it, it was soggy and not crispy at all. The pizza was cut and I use that word loosely because we had to get a knife and recut it in order to pull the slices apart. Toppings was good and not skimpy. The pizza was ok not the best. I probably won't be back.",1
"Same owners as P.F. Chang's. Keep in mind this is FAST FOOD, and judging it by what other fast food is like out there, Pei Wei hits a home run. For modest prices, you get an order that easily feeds two people. So, for less than 10, two people can eat a freshly prepared meal that is fairly healthy. Very busy at prime dining hours. Suggest early, late, or takeout order. Blazing noodles is excellent.",2
"The decor is really nice and the food is amazing. After traveling Italy for four months I would still say that the gnocchi here is incredible! The only thing I didn't like was the lack of attention to the bathroom floors, the amount of dust collecting was disgusting. Everything else was great including the amazing white bean appetizer with olive oil and fresh bread.",2
"As soon as you walk into this place you can already tell that this place will be delicious. I was greeted the moment I opened the door, and I knew that I would enjoy my experience here. I had the Cali Omelette and it was like the angels singing hallelujah as I savor each bite. This place is definitely a must go to if you're in Vegas! Come early though its first come first serve for diners!",2
Way better than any fast food establishment. A taste of home for me! I was over joyed to discover this place. Definitely worth the 15 minute drive for the vietnamese sandwiches. Authentic and CHEAP. Definitely good eats. One minor downside is that they sort of skimp on the meat and this is coming from someone who normally orders veggie sandwiches! Still love it though!,2
"Get the Local Access card if you are a Vegas local! Why you ask? So you can get Happy Hour discount all the time! No more complaints about having your work schedule changed, so you get out of work just when their HH ends. 1 sliders and wings for the win. Buy one get one free selected domestic, draft well. During football season they also have a buffet for patrons! Love it!",2
Server Brian M completely killed the night for me and my date. Food came before drinks.Brian disappeared in the back for 20 minutes then proceeded to pass our table full of empty glasses 3 times until I walked up to him and gave him my credit card. Thanks but no thanks. I was generous with the tip even though it was not earned. Cheers. On to another restaurant to continue the evening.,1
"The food was lousy. The cheese pizza was greasy and bland. It reminded me of pizza at the cafeteria when I was in college. The lime chicken sandwich that my wife ordered was also less than stellar. The service was slow, and they already had run out of several sandwiches on the menu, even though we ordered around 1pm.",1
"The food is OK, but the selling point is it is one of the few places in Charlotte that has culture and history. An old victorian building in a neighborhood that feels more like Charleston than Charlotte. Tired of uptown chains and overprices bistros, head to this place. Great beer selection and a pub feel make this a great pick.",2
"I'm not a big fried chicken fan and I have not been to a KFC in years. I kept seeing all these ads for how KFC has changed. They lowered the prices and now have supposed grilled chicken. NOPE, still awful. I got a box meal and it was cold. I ordered a bowl for my husband and they charged me for something else, which was more money. No sorry or a refund. I won't be back.",1
"Great Place. Food was wonderful, you need to try the Pot Roast I know that sounds odd at a smoke house but it is great. I tried the Mac and Cheese, Pulled Pork, Ribs, Chicken wings, Chicken Salad, and all were great. I will stop in every time I am in Charlotte. And they also have great hiring practices, very cute to hot.",2
" ""Announcement We're Changing Everything! Our 180 million transformation is near completion. "" Yeah, they kind of need it. Very plain and boring, but it is very clean. The low ceilings were really awkward. Location is not ideal, as it's far away from all the good clubs. Disclaimer I did not stay here, just strolled through and explored.",1
"Seriously fuck this place. Doesn't matter if you buy tickets ahead of time or not. The guys controlling the line deliberately keep the lines from moving to generate tips for themselves. Honestly, they're shameless. They count their ""hard earned "" money in front of the rest of us not willing to pay the 40 per person to cut.",1
"Went for minor throat symptoms. Was prescribed prednisone a steroid . When I got home and checked the bottle, it was labeled cephalexin an antibiotic and had someone else's name! Turns out everyone got the right pills, but my bottle had the wrong label. So not as bad as it might have been, but still an unacceptable mistake. Doubt I will use them again.",1
"Poor service right from the start we waited 45 mins for table when they told us 15 mins max, we were there for breakfast at 9 30am when we left it was time for lunch. I give it another year and they will be out of business you have to turn over tables quicker then every 2 hours. Food is fair to poor. S U C K SUCK SUCK SUCK!",1
"This used to be a favorite place of mine. The service standards have gone downhill quite a bit. One example is I waited 10 minutes for a refill on iced tea, at the bar. The food is still outstanding, but I think I will take my hard earned money to Sal's Gilbert Pizza. You have truly let me down Pesto's.",1
"I walked in, standing there like an idiot waiting to be greeted. Didn't happen. There were at least 6 barbers there and no body said anything to me. About 3 minutes later a black lady came in with her son, and this one guy stops what he is doing to greet her and set up a haircut for her son. So unless you're black, don't go here They won't make you feel comfortable.",1
"Went in today for the first time upon recommendation from a friend. Decided to get the deluxe pedicure the most expensive of the the three spa pedicures they offer . From the start i was treated warmly, with respect, and the lady did a wonderful job. it closed with a paraffin dip on my feet, which made them feel amazing. Keep up the great work. i will definitely be going back here.",2
"Great food awesome prices and a monsterous selectioon alcoholic drinks over 300 I just tried the ""afterburner chicken combo "" about 8 dollars with fries drink and tax included. Wow that was an amazing sandwhich . . . I live over 40 miles from the shop but eat here as often as I can because of the value and quality of the food!",2
"Clean, well stocked, and very efficient check out far better than my 'normal' Von's and nearly as convenient when you take into account the lack of having to venture into Boca Park. Prices trend a bit higher than Wal Mart and non organic vegetables are sometimes limp, but by and by a quality grocery store with good prices and all the essentials.",2
"2.5.same as Carnival in Rio Huge selections, our server was such a lovely lady and bottomless mimosa for 27.can't beat that. Plus, we came when there was NO line on a Saturday noon. Wow! Sadly.the crab legs are super duper skinny and the baby shrimp well . Won't be going out of the strip for this again.",1
"Went for the first time for brunch. My husband and I sat outside which was beautiful. We could hear the Saints fans cheering at the bar. I had a delicious mimosa and shrimp grits. That dish may be my new favorite thing anywhere! My husband had the jambalaya also good but I preferred mine. The service was excellent, quite a few people out and about to help and our waitress was terrific.",2
Nothing special at all. nThe food is flavorless ni came to eat here 3 different times n just thought maybe they had a bad day nbut 3 strikes and im out. this place is terrible nit just seems like they are getting lazier and lazier nfrom the flavorless food to the lousy service. high prices for cheap food and crappy service.,1
I live down the street from Joe's and eat there frequently for breakfast and lunch. Breakfast tacos HEAVEN. Curry chicken salad sandwich BLISS.and the Garlic Fries DE FREAKING LICIOUS! Everything on the menu showcases care and incredible flavor. Don't forget to go next door to the Coffee Shop and try a cupcake and or coffee!,2
Had to use a laundromat since my washing machine broke down. Found this place since it is close to where i live and had good reviews. I give this place a 0. More then half the washing machines were out of order. In addition the free wifi was not working. Would not recommend or use this place again until they at least fix the machines.,1
"The customer service at this b dubs is unreasonably good. They're quick, friendly, and frequently check to make sure you don't need more wings or drinks. From any seat in the house you can see at least a dozen TV's. Unfortunately, they're all showing various types of sportsball, so there's not much to watch.",2
"Everything about this place is funky and eclectic from the appearance to the patrons and the music and the store bar coffee house. It is a great place to hang out with friends, just people watch, meet new people, have a beer or get coffee, grab a deli sandwich. The have a wide selection of craft beers and some seasonal beers on tap. The Midwood area is awesome and this place is one of the reasons.",2
"Wow. Super disappointed. Marginally edible food. Poor service. Minimal understanding of product or preparation . No chance of a return. No one running the zoo. No welcome, no thank you, no fu.just a big check for food most of which we left on our plates. Didn't think this could be worse than Kennedys. I was sooo wrong.",1
This place is an amazing venue! It's a theatre in the round with a stage that slowly turns! No matter where you sit you have a great seat! It's not CRAZY loud but sounds awesome! Good bar. The only thing that sucked was only one girls bathroom! Lol! Can't wait to see what else is coming here! Just saw 3 Doors Down! Loved it!,2
"No stars! Horrible! I Don't care if it is pet friendly! I'm telling you now, this place is the slums It's broke down and dirty! I don't care how many ""UPDATES "" they do to the place, it's bad. Rooms are tiny! No accommodations at all. Ugh! Never again! Prostitutes and drug dealers hang in the parking lot ",1
Spectacular. This is one of the best shows on the strip. What makes this show even better? There are discounts available for this show so take advantage of them while you can! Good Spectacular show with discounts readily available. Bad Some seats can be really bad in this show so choose carefully. Final Go watch it!,2
"Clean quick, wax job expensive, 50 for my Quad cab truck Covered dry area. Crew doesn't drive away excess H2O from bed. They do blow out vehicle creases. They get a ""B "". They clean the windows good, but could spend more time on each vehicle the slower it is. The cleaning crew dies job in out of the bed to dry the top clean back windows. Nice job Genie.",2
"Great beer selection. Giant sized versions of Connect Four and Jenga, along with cornhole and ping pong. What could be bad?!? nBig ol' beer garden that I've heard about for 6 months since I've been here. Finally got here. Truthfully, I don't see any reason why, for what they are, I couldn't give it 5 stars.but I feel like 5 should be reserved for spectacular, so 4 it is!",2
Pros nSome of the best chicken fingers there is. nGood sweet tea. nGood garlic toast. Cons nTOO MANY CALORIES. nCane's sauce is kind of gross. nOnly 4 meals available which all consist of different amounts of the same thing. Raising Cane's I love you but you could at least have some hot sauce available.,2
"We made a point of making a reservation in hopes of getting a table on the terrasse which we were promised on arrival but the manager decided to keep us at the bar and let walk in couples take the spots outside. Disappointing treatment, ruined our experience. Our server was excellent but the management had poor communication skills. The staff was appropriately apologetic.",1
One word.amazing! we orderd the macaron ice cream sandwich one with chocolate macarons and cookies and cream ice cream and another with vanilla macarons and pink guava ice cream. Both are so good i cant believe it took us forever before we got around to trying this place out considering that we live around the corner! we will definitely be back! will also definitely spread the word!,2
"Excellent fast mexican food, and the staff is super friendly. The Super Burrito is the equivalent of the Carne Asada plate wrapped in a tortilla. My wife ordered the Machaca plate it was tasty and she was unable to eat it all.as for decor, it's basic but very clean. We will definitely eat here again.",2
"What a beautiful place, went for happy hour great prices, nice portion sizes, beautiful presentation, the staff was friendly an attentive, the food tasted amazing, couldn't of asked for a nicer time, the chef was amazing, very professional, would definatly recommend this place an take out of town guests. Loved it!",2
"AJ tailors is my favorite place to take my clothes. I was referred to the place and have gone there for three years. The owner, Anna, is a sweetheart and knows me by name. I've never had a problem with any clothing item after she's done. I would recommend this to place to anyone. Excellent service, timely and friendly.",2
Cheap. Healthy. Great. Perfect breakfast spot for 2 to 4. Had Sunday family of 4 breakfast there and waffles and pancakes were outstanding. Kids grilled cheese outstanding. Highly recommend banana pancakes. Rosemary potatoes underdone a bit and just okay. Scramble and grilled veggies very good too with eggs. I'm not a vegan. Funky cool. Great find. Easy street parking.,2
"Pros n My beer was delicious Cons n Portions were way smaller than they used to be n The chicken breast in my sandwich was pretty flavourless and could be mistaken for a Wendy's one. n My date's salmon was equally flavorless Overall nHaving been let down twice by their food, I will never come to L3B again for anything more than drinks. Even drink accompanying nosh is best ordered elsewhere",1
"Rude staff, no greeting or welcoming! nNot helpful at all. nLack of knowledge, 2 of 4 items I was looking for was out of stock. One of the sales person said she was checking it on the back but after 10 mins she never came back. I walk away and I saw her was chatting with bunch of coworkers. No one was paying attention but chatting to other coworkers. nWhat a great service",1
This was my first time coming here. Everyone I have talked to about this place said they use to come here all the time and that the food was really good. Its owned by Russians and despite that the pizza was really good. I will be coming here more often. I recommend coming here if you havent been before.,2
I was told on the phone it would be a starting price of 119 depending how long it takes. nWhen the tech showed up he quoted 260. I talked him down and he agreed to do it for 220 but in cash. It took him less than a min program the fob. so in my eyes it should have been 119! nI wish I would have read the review. YES I FEEL CHEATED,1
"I took my dog there a few weeks ago at 2 45 and there was a note on the door ""out for lunch, back in 15 "" so we waited 25 minutes and wheo one ever came back we finally left and went to the Soggy Dog. Having lunch is FINE, but don't say 15 mins when it really means CLOSED. Wasted an hour of my day waiting and driving to the other place.",1
"Alirght Heard about this place on the 702 scene. Looks good, took the wife there for dinner. First off lets starts with the PRICE for two its about that much. Now let me tell you about that food. Food was good the frist time around, end of story. No i will not go back to this Over Price buffet. Sorry I forgot to take picture of the food. ""Till next time my food lover. till next time. """,1
"I came here for replacement coils on my Aspire et s bdc. The price was double that on the internet, but i decided to support local business. When i opened them i discovered that although they came in an Aspire box they weren't stamped with the brand. I feel a little ripped off. I'll suck it up, and when they're toast i'm buying authentics online at half the price from MBV.",1
So we came here for a nice meal. We had a party of about 13 people. We got in in a reasonable time considering there is no reservation. However one of the people that ordered food in our group never received it. Everyone was finished before they even acknowledged this. It was handled very unprofessional. Because of this I will not be back.,1
"We went to this buffet as part of the ""Buffet of Buffets "" pass purchased at one of the other casinos. While the pass is a good idea, stopping at this buffet is not. We went for lunch, and I suppose it was edible, but I've had better food in college dorm cafeterias. Golden Corral looks like a 5 star buffet in comparison! The service was poor.",1
"Right now Chinatown is having specials 20 hr. This place was 40 hr, he asked for a discount since there were 2 of us huge discount 20 30minutes. Must pay first so when you are done with the 20 minutes and that wasn't even being massaged the whole time since she talks with her hands was more interested in her conversation than giving a massage. Do yourself a favor go elsewhere",1
This place was awful. The food was subpar. We aren't that hard to please but when the food is low quality and over cooked it's a recipe for disaster. Luckily the omelette station was fresh but everything else was horrible. Save your money and go somewhere else. Even McDonalds breakfast would have been better,1
"Found raw chicken on our daughter's pasta plate after she had already eaten most of it, and I had eaten her garlic bread that was sitting on top of it. Told the waitress and she didn't even offer to not charge us for our daughter's pasta that we of course couldn't finish. Praying we don't get food poisoning from it.",1
"The French toast on my sandwich for lunch was absolutely delicious! However, I cannot say I am a fan of the monte cristo. French toast to me needs to be seperate from eggs. I love me some good french toast. I figured Id give it a shot. Just not my thing all together. I ate everything separate from one another. My boyfriend loved his pastrami sandwich he said. I cannot wait to go and try breakfast!",2
"I'm a big fan of Cantina 1511! The food is delicious, the staff is attentive, and the prices aren't too shabby. The guacamole is made fresh right in front of you which I'm a huge fan of. It is a about 10 so I would say it's good to share with others since you will have plenty of leftovers. I would definitly recommend this place.",2
Can someone please point out the reasons why anyone would frequent this place? Definitely not planning to come back. Maybe it was the indifferent yet holier than thou barista. Maybe it was the shitty coffee and food. Maybe it was the 3 millimeter thick film of filth covering every surface in the place. In summary Kiva Han is a dirty hipster dive.,1
"This place is way over priced for regular breakfast food. Might as well go to Denny's for half the price. Even the bacon namesake was not even thick cut bacon. It wasn't burnt I guess. And why do they have hershey bags everywhere? I didn't see any chocolate on the menu. Oh, and they have a strict lunch can only be ordered after 11 ? policy. It was 1040 when we ordered. that's pretty harsh.",1
"Just moved into the neighborhood and looking for a good pizza place, read good reviews on Yelp so wanted to try Sano's for the first time today but unfortunately I can't because I've been trying to call for delivery but cannot get through to anyone. Been calling constantly, it rings but no answer! It's a bummer I can't get a hold of them!",1
"This place is worth the wait! There always seems to be a wait when we arrive, yet it never really seems to be that long. The service is always great, they have good hearty food, and strong coffee! My hardest dilemma with breakfast is that I always want to try everything! Guess that means I need to continue coming back!",2
"The decor inside isn't bad. We tried the taiwanese meatball, oyster omelette, and sticky rice. I think the cook was having a bad day because none of it was very good. The omlette had the wrong flavor and way too much starch. Maybe we should have tried the fried food like the popcorn chicken and pork chop. Nothing like the food at Sinbala in the SGV. It feels bad to waste all that food.",1
"Was looking forward to having a great Mexicaeighborhood restaurant in this location. Extremely disappointed with our huevos rancheros. So so salty couldn't even finish. Beans would be excellent if salt were reduced. Rice okay but again salted to the max. And my hubby felt the same, and he is one to always reach for the salt shaker.",1
Noticed the last few times we have visited that there are fewer people than it used to be. We ate here early the other day and scallops were good. Fried green tomatoes were delicious. My husband got shrimp and grits and he was happy with his food. Nor sure where all the people have gone. The food has always been pricey and it just seems it may be a little pricey for the economy for what they have.,2
"Great find! First time here. Waitress was extremely friendly. Owner came over to make sure we were enjoying the meal. I had the Spanish omelet. The salsa was very good! Biscuits and gravy were tasty. Gravy was good with a fresh made heavy biscuit. Over all despite the outside appearance and bric a brac decor, we will def be returning!",2
"The establishment opens at 5 00 PM, I get there at 5 20ish and the lady at the booth says ""We are closed for a private event "" and then asked me to come back at 7 00 PM. Honestly, no point in rating this any higher as they didn't bother reserving open seats for general people. They didn't even bother changing the giant sign on their podium that said ""Opens at 5 00 PM """,1
This has been the best go to place for years! The lady that owns the place I think her name is NO? has an unreal ability to remember every guest and what they prefer to order. She is always there to greet us with a smile and a hug and has food on our table before we can sit down. By far the BEST spring and summer rolls in the city. And the 45 is my constant go to. Highly recommend!,2
"I had a 60 minute aromatherapy massage and it was phenomenal. The therapist was so caring and asked specifically what areas are your most tensed. She combines western and Eastern medicine techniques and also performs reflexology on your feet. As a nurse, being on my feet all day and lifting and moving patients, it really takes a toll on your body and she hit every. single. spot. Hurt so good!",2
"I love getting the bulgogi bento or bowl, with just beef and onions. They also have the Mexican coke which I love getting with my meal! Everything is reasonably priced too. It also gets really busy during lunch hour so it's best to call in for take out and pick it up. I can't wait to try the spicy pork",2
Love this place. Staff is always pretty awesome when I'm there. Its a 10 cab drive to the strip planet Hollywood or a quick walk. Some rooms have an amazing view of the strip if you're lucky. nThe convince store and little food place in the back tower tower II is pretty good. Love the pools bit does get crowded in the summer. Game room and business center with computers in tower I is great.,2
"My wife and I celebrated our 10 year anniversary here. We wanted a relaxing break, and Red delivered. Our suite was huge with a view of Camp Randall stadium, and the complimentary shuttle service dropped us off in Madison to enjoy the night life. We would highly recommend Red because of the friendly staff and modern layout.",2
"This place is pretty good! we got a large pizza, half white sauce with garlic and the other half with pizza sauce with toppings. the pizza sauce was whatever but the white sauce was pretty amazing. we got the spinach salad which was also really good and well dressed and had nice portions of Gorgonzola cheese and bacon. The staff is pretty nice and the food was great.",2
Not a big fan of this place.they don't even have glitter polish for regular manicures for me and my daughter.the girl at the front said she looked everywhere for it and then said I could bring my own! What.if I did that I would just do it all myself and save money.also my daughter is very shy and quiet and didn't let them know they burned her with the hot towels.they were not very friendly either.,1
"Love this place. I usually take my son there once a week. He enjoys the chipotle sandwich and the chocolate pie which is one of the best . For me, the Moroccan sandwich is my favorite. Today I also tried the leeks and potato soup, it was just perfect. And for dessert I had the pear pie. Beautiful as always. The owners are really friendly people and the workers are really nice.",2
"Heard about this place in the paper with someone recommending it for good Japanese food. Thought we'd give it a try. A little pricy, but honestly, the quantity was very good as well as the taste. We'll go back and try some of the other choices. Looks like there's one closer to us though. There was only one other group of people there, so it was pretty quiet, which is fine.",2
"I had high hopes for GHBC but they fell short. I ordered 2 sandwiches for me and the wifey, asked for both to be toasted and to throw jalapenos on mine. When I arrived home neither had been toasted and no jalapenos. The sandwiches tasted good but they weren't prepared the way we asked and for 15 I expect to have things done properly.",1
"Ben,jay, Jesse and Mirlio did an outstanding job. They showed up with a two man crew but the A team showed up about two to three hours later and moved all my stuff. We were a two truck move they guys hustled all day and not a single thing broke. They were courteous and made sure all the furniture was where I wanted it. I recommend them highly they got it done! Thanks guys.",2
do not i say again do not go here service was extremely horrid called police on me because i sent a sushi roll which wasn't actually a roll back told to pay for whole dish cause i ate a piece and a half when waiting for cop to arrive made me sit outside didn't allow me back in wont ever go back i Update cop also agreed with me and told the owner to learn good customer service,1
"I went there with the use of a Groupon coupon and it was just so so, the portions were small, the service totally unorganized despite it being a dead night. I did not leave a 15 tip to the supposed 79 value ridiculous it was unmerited. The location was bright and spacious but over priced for what you got.",1
"This has been a terrible experience flying. It is ridiculous that they charge you for every bag you bring or check. I understand flights being delayed, but don't board everyone and then make us sit on the plane for an hour! The layover time between flights was crazy long as well. They also charge for soda on the plane. All in all a negative experience.",1
"The waiting area seats are stained and old. it gives you the creeps to sit down. their reception is rude and not happy to be there, and they waited until after my 79 year old mother's exam to tell her they do not accept Culinary insurance anymore then slapped a huge bill in her face. Find a better establishment for testing.",1
"My boyfriend was getting a haircut and I was just waiting around at the First Choice in UW plaza. After my boyfriend paid, I noticed some extra long pieces of hair. so I asked the barber to trim it again. She looked slightly annoyed and just quickly cut off an entire patch. It was cheap and fast but not worth it.",1
"I am on a quest in Edinburgh to find the best scones around. The sheer size of the scones at Papii is exactly what drew me in. Overall, this was a decent scone. Decent price, came with a huge serving of clotted cream and jam. On a side note, highly recommend the iced tea for those rare Scottish summer days.",2
I didn't really care for Pure the first time we went there. But we gave it another try tonight. Dinner came in a matter of minutes even before we got the chips and salsa. I tried my son's kids beef taco and the beef was horrible tasting. The menu is over priced for Mexican food plus it's not that good. It was also extremely hot in the restaurant.,1
"This is one mediocre Japanese Restaurant n Osaka House, not cheap came up to 39 including tip for an average tonkatsu It's because the woman got cold, became whiny and refused to walk a few more steps to the Mediterranean one. I'd never be caught dead in a place under 3.5 stars unless it's Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve. Restaurant bar was terribly empty. Avoid! Tourist trap.",1
"How would I describe the taste of food at Wicked Spoon if I was asked? Bland. That's right, the food here tastes bland. Yup, I've made tofu that had more taste than the food here. I am only referring to the main dishes here, dessert on the other hand, is very good. It's pretty pricey for a buffet with food this dull, so stick with Paris or Bellagio buffets, they are much much better.",1
"I recently stayed at The Mirage for a business conference and was impressed with the level of service and amenities. The room was spacious, bed was comfortable, and casino helped me leave Vegas a winner. I hated the pillows because they were all down and not what I prefer to sleep on. The bellman was a little pushy, but all other staff was courteous. I would certainly return.",2
solid bbq not great but never been dissapointed very good burnt ends good burgers if someone in group doesn't wan't bbq like the beans and cornbread good kids meals at ressonable prices my kids love that they come with oreos have always had solid service prices on par with other bbq joints like the variety of sauce choices hubby loves the blues music they play,2
"This place is awesome! It was as if my grandma and aunts were back there cooking for me and I know they weren't because they are in my hometowot cooking for me I had six tacos de lengua cow tongue, dont turn your face all wrinkled either cuz that stuff is good, try to expand your palate you simp . Anyhoo, I will be going back there again.",2
"Went on my birthday and they gave me my buffet 100 off cool . Based on comments from the three other people I was with, they all felt the sushi was decent 3.5 star sushi. Hey, it's a buffet not a hand crafted made for you sushi dinner. Kudos on the vast selection, great service, free birthday meal and a solid 3.5 star meal.",2
"The best thing about our visit was our waitress. She was attentive and apologetic that the pizza was terrible. It was undercooked, the crust was soggy and the toppings were sparse. Too bad. It was the first time we have been out in the evening in 4 months.What a disappointment! We won't be returning.",1
"I got a very bad service from United Airlines on Feb 2014. Bad customer service, disorganized system, just very poor service overall. I wish someone would have warned me beforehand. I will never fly with United ever again. I would pay more to fly on a different Airline and you should as well. Not worth it!",1
"THE BEST Street tacos I have had in Arizona after eating Mex here for 15 years. Reminds me of being in Cozumel and San Carlos.genuine street tacos.Meat is moist, and Mesquite flavored just enough. Salsas there are excellent too from a mild pico to their green which has a bite.Refried beans are perfect too.I will be going back, Taco Tuesdays are a wicked good deal.",2
Eek! Methinks not. Very very bland salsa. Tastes close to water with a hint of cayenne and stale chips! I had to season them with salt to at least taste something a bit. nI had breakfast steak burrito. Hubby is right. Sonic's tastes better. nWe expected good food because of the 4 star reviews in average but left disappointed and wont be coming back nor be recommending this place to friends.,1
"Came for dinner on a recommendation and was not disappointed. Could have easily gotten slammed on the Orange Dragons. So delicious and smooth I can't say enough. The menu has just enough not to make choosing frustrating. The service and food did not disappoint. Portions were just right, so if ya plan to stay and dance you won't be lazy.",2
"Arrogaant and no customer service. Delivery is a mess, we had a large appliance delivered today and they did not deliver it until 6 00 PM even though they were within a few blocks from our house about 4 hour earlier, we saw them. Could not get them to stop by. nI would not recommend you purchase from them.",1
"I will definitely come back to his Discount Tire location. Our mechanic, Jesse, was incredibly helpful, professional, and friendly, and helped me lower the price of 4 new tires on my 4WD Ford Explorer exponentially. Such a great deal! And only took 30 minutes! Would definitely recommend them so a family member or friend.",2
"After reading the great reviews on Yelp I was encouraged to call and ask about having our alternator replaced. We were quoted 650 from another local place but KCM was able to get us in that same day and it ended up being 430. They are a locally owned family run business and they are friendly, honest and helpful. I will definitely be back.",2
Horrible experience and will NOT return. Totally disorganized. Most of the empty tables were unbussed. Three lines merged into one and orders were not taken correctly. Workers were standing around with dazed looks and unwilling to help they simply pointed to a different person when asked for assistance.,1
ZERO STARS. Do not rent from dollar thrifty at the Las Vegas airport. I wish I had paid a dollar a day more to rent from someone else. Every customer takes 14 21 minutes to do their paperwork you have plenty of time to time them . I waited about 80 minutes with my young children to get a dirty car. This has to be the least efficient system I have seen in a long time.,1
The feel of the place seems to be for university students ready for a take out. I ordered the special which was tagine and it was dreadful. I could not finish it. It was a sloppy brown congealed beany mess. I can't believe they were willing to serve it. I tasted my boyfriend's shawarma and I have had better when I went to school in California.,1
over priced for sure. Checked out at T.I came here for bfast before the road and it was blah my dad was raving about it as we waited but it was just eh. i ordered the Fresh Market Skillet eh it came with soggy hash browns and eggs that i could totally tell where powdered kinda disappointing wasnt salted. i mean blah,1
"Okay Indian food. Bit overpriced. The naan is big and fresh. The service is sub par. I ordered an aloo paratha once and the owner brought me a regular paratha. Did you think I didn't know? The vindaloo tastes okay. The lassi is waaayyy too thick. They do have mango kulfi, which Ambar does not. But 10 out of 10 times I would go to Ambar.",1
"I started going to Melissa Cline a few months ago, and she is honestly fabulous. I'm a blonde, and I came in with pretty damaged hair, and now it's so much prettier and healthier because of her. She is so attentive to your needs, accommodating to your schedule, easy to talk to, cares about the health of your hair and gives you so many tips. She is so fabulous. I would recommend her to anyone!",2
"This was a nice little stop downtown while we were doing out rounds at the arts festival. Was not busy at all, and we were able to get in and out quickly. The staff were polite and had our drinks made io time flat. It was that quick that I wasn't able to notice anything else about this place except that it had outdoor seating, that's how quickly they work here.",2
"Chateau, or Shitbox as I call it, had potential with the space it occupies but they failed to execute. The layout inside is just horrible! Is there a dancefloor or isn't there?! And the tables are just stupid too. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because the outside patio area really is nice. But not enough to get me there even if you're giving me a free bottle on my Tuesdays off.",1
"It's been too long since I've eaten here. I love this place. It's cozy, relaxed and stylish. I The one and only critique is that I wish their menu had more options. However, everything that I've tried is delicious. I love the dates stuffed with chorizo and manchego cheese. If you haven't tired Tuck Shop, you should ",2
"Standing here experiencing horrible customer service. I usually use them to do all my printing in mass and have had awesome success at other locations. This location however is slow, unapologetic, and took over 30 minutes for a small and simple job. Not coming back to this location again. Learned my lesson!",1
"I have been going to this threading boutique for about a year now, and I am consistently satisfied with my eyebrows each visit. Each time I go, I get my eyebrows threaded by the same lady Shaista is absolutely amazing! She does a super wonderful job threading, shaping, and trimming my eyebrows! Always happy and satisfied with my services here! Leave happy every time!",2
"Why do they charge so much to use credit cards? I don't usually carry cash and its annoying having to have to pay so much because of plastic. I love Baskin and Robbins. Its nostalgic for me actually and this one is near my home but come on, I have to go to the ATM because some times they don't even accept credit cards.",1
"Best ""chain "" coffee I've had, beats the 'bucks' off others! Friendly staff, always chatty, and not in that ""they make me ask you "" kind of way. Dutch Bros. actually hires people who love to talk to their customers, it's as refreshing as my favorite double chocolate mocha hot or iced, good golly this coffee is wonderful !",2
"The casino is fun, but the service at the restaurants is terrible! We went to the Asian restaurant and waited for 30 min while all of the tables were empty. Frustrating! Then after a night on the tables, we went to the 24 7 cafe and waited 30 minutes for water. Not what I would label as acceptable service, especially since there were 2 tables, including us, in the restaurant",1
"Drove by this restaurant for the past few years, but xmas eve decided to give it a try. Small place but good service and large menu. I got a bacon, egg and cheese bagel, my wife got an omlette and I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravey. All were tasty and will definitely go back as it was a good value.",2
" CLOSED Wish I ate here more! This place has one of the city's best burgers and poutine fries, gravy and cheese I had the Rattlecan Burger cooked medium rare to perfection with an egg! For all you Fatburger lovers out there.if thats good.this is great! I would eat here once a week if I could and tell all my friends about it! I ATE HERE MARCH 4th.HEARD THEY DID NOT OPEN AGAIN ON MARCH 5th! CLOSED!",2
"I always enjoy my annual eye exam here. Overall, this is an excellent office with great Doctors and Staff. I always feel they take the time to see each patient and answer all my questions. It always has a very warm and inviting atmosphere, which is very important to me having been to other medical offices that were not welcoming at all.",2
"Worst business ever. We were downtown for an hour, and saw no one using the zip line. We decided to do it and they told us they were sold out. They can only sell 48 spots pre hour. I asked why there was no line, and why I couldn't just pay and go up, but they refused. Smart business, turn away money wheo one is using your services .",1
"Doug the manager was so great to work with in planning my 30th birthday. The staff was so accommodating, and the upstairs room was perfect. I highly recommend anyone who wants to have a laid back and chill event to consider this venue. The staff and manager were both excellent, and the food was great. Thank you for a fantastic party!",2
"Decided to drop in to Divan Orange on a Friday night. Always a great atmosphere here. Good local bands playing, young crowd was pretty much into the tunes. Mostly a standing room type of place, beer is cheap and service is always friendly. Great spot to chill and listen to some non commercial music.",2
Delicious pad tai. Crispy and not chewy sesame chicken. nIf you are planning on dining in you better not have a large party because the place is as big as a 1 bedroom apartment. SUPER TINY. nMore expensive than China a Go Go. The price and small dining area is why I didn't rate 5 stars. nThis place is routinely confused with the Little Dumpling on Decatur.beware.,2
The view from my hotel room was amazing. I love the fact that you can control everything in the room from a touch screen that they have near the bed. The touch screen though is slow to respond and can get annoying at times. The hotel is really clean as well. In the casino you don't get that smokey smell unless your shitting next to someone who is smoking.,2
"Great hotel. nThe ""normal "" rooms are more spacious than many hotel suites. nWe stayed there for News Years Eve and New Years Day. We got a hold of a 199 a night rate which is spectacular for New Years Eve. nPlenty of food to eat and even more bars. nPlenty of slot machines but not as many tables as I would think a Las Vegas hotel might have.",2
"I am so obsessed with this place. The environment is great, the prices are great, and the drinks and food are AMAZING! They've got so many options, both with and without boba. I absolutely love coming here on my day off and just relaxing with a large chocolate banana smoothie with extra boba. SO GOOD!",2
We went for the first time yesterday and were quite pleased! My mom got the bacon pancakes and I got the mushroom Swiss burger. Both were delicious! I love the fact that they use Angus beef and all natural products! Especially pleased to see the nitrate free hot dogs on the menu for kids. Very rare and makes me feel that much better about bringing my kids here. Look forward to coming back soon.,2
Hey OWNERS of this place! Are you listening? I came back because it's the only place to get a beer in terminal two. Same old tired wait staff. So. Let me be clear. You could double your profits if you would just stop hiring these slugs! I'm about to call bar rescue on you fools. I shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes to get a beer especially when I'm sitting at the bar.,1
"I will never go back to this place ever again. We had a party of 5 and 2 of them were children. I ended up getting these poor babies there drinks after 45 minutes of waiting. Food was cold and not that great. There were only 2 waitress working the porch and it was packed! We walked out not paying the bill, come to find out we were not the only party to do that on the same night.",1
"It was my first time there and honestly i was really disappointed. I tried the carnitas and they not even looked like real mexican carnitas, the chorizo was ok but whats really bad is the service OMG i asked for a second beer three times and it never came, the hostess and the waitress were extremely rude. That was the first and last time in Mais",1
"Great atmosphere, make sure to park Valet on the northeast corner of the mall and take elevator. We made reservations and was seated promptly. Our server, Seidi was unbelievable and offered great suggestions. She made our party feel very welcomed. Food was great! Recommendations nApp zucchini sticks nMeal Chicken Parm nDes tiramisu",2
"I used to LOVE this place. In the recent months all of the staff has changed and they seem to have a huge chip on their shoulder. They are extremely overpriced and now just flat rude. It is really a shame, I have been bringing all of my cars here for years. Unfortunately I will be finding a new place with a friendlier face.",1
One of the best Thai's food place I have eaten in a long time. I live in OC with many good Thai restaurant but this is better than all the one in OC. Drunken Noodle was eaten by my HIGH MAITENANCE friend and she loved it. She said best Drunken Noodle she ever had. Parking lot and outside restaurant looks like a whole in the wall place but food makes up for it. A block from Strastosphere.,2
"The stars are for the food court! I still cannot get over how good my unagi don was! My friends also tried their bulgogi potato pizza, we're coming back to try more of the food D as for grocery, love the meats and noodles, these products are not available at every asian market! This is my favorite place to go for my asian food needs!",2
"The customer service was wonderful, and the owner is also very interactive with the customers, and very nice as well. The food is very tasty, and the happy hour wine is even better. I would definitely go here for lunch and maybe even a date. LOL The setting is beautiful. This is going to be my new Go To!",2
"I've eaten at R T's always hoping that the something on the menu would have flavor, but I've been disappointed each time. The ambience is charming in an old Mexico sort of way, but the food is very bland. Once I found Tony's Cafe about 1 4 mile east of R T's , I was in Mexican food heaven! Tony's has much, much better food.",1
"This place is amazing! Best burritos I've ever had. The meat is perfect but the toppings couldn't be more fresh, every time I come in it's as if they were just prepared. The finely diced jalape u00f1os are the heat! They have a Salsa bar with lots of variety and an excellent drink selection, the regular stuff as well Mexican specials. This is my first 5 star restaurant.",2
"So Disappointed! ! I shopped at the St. Vincent's thrift stores where I'm from and they were wonderful. They were also based on Charity. This store is based on GREED. It was filthy, over priced, and the staff was less than kind to anyone I saw come in. The man behind the counter watched TV and spoke to no one! Used, torn furniture for 200! Really?",1
"It's located at the Renaissance Hotel lobby. My boyfriend and I chose the bar and had few drinks and pizza. Margherita was really tasty and super crispy crusted. Impressive. There weren't a lot of people on a Friday night so the service was really fast and staff was very friendly and polite. I love that! We have enjoyed watching some basketball, chit chat and went back to our room.",2
"This was an incredible show! We had seats way in the back, and the show still didn't disappoint. song after song, the show got better as it progressed! The effects are awesome and the performers are top notch and on par with all of the other Cirque shows around town. I think MJ would have approved of this show.",2
"I love this little hole in the wall. Don't be fooled by it appearance. I ordered steak and cheese breakfast burrito. Wow, nice big burrito. Everything tastes so fresh. Here is a pro tip. Asked them to wrap it in their whole wheat tortilla! Yowza, one of the best brekky burritos I have ever had. Great local shop",2
"I come here for their katsu curry rice bowl. It's by far my most favourite item on the menu, served in a large bowl too so it'd help if you're hungry. Their servers are very friendly, full of smiles and the restaurant has a pretty good ambiance to it, pipe in j pop and a classy touch to their decor. 2 thumbs up!",2
"I am Not a fan. A la carte pricing means your dinner becomes really expensive really fast. There are things on the menu like the ground beef tacos that are simply not good. If friends want to go here, I get two fried fish tacos and then eat something later around 9pm. The real mystery is Why do my friends keep wanting to go here?",1
"My husband and I ate here for the first time recently. The food is delicious! If you're looking for amazing, authentic Indian cuisine, this is it! The leftovers were just as good the next day! I subtracted one star, because the service could be just a little better, but nothing that would keep me from coming back for more!",2
Tried this out for Restaurant Week and was very glad. Service was excellent as was the food. Had the 12 oz Sirloin and the others tried the Salmon. Had the Canadian Bacon appetizer and it was good. We also had a half dozen Oysters which were not on the Restaurant week menu. Everything was perfect. Our waiter Jare was a real pleasure. We will be back for special occasions.,2
"This review is for their Greenfield park restaurant. Went there with friends, service is quasi I existent and very very very poor. Food does not seems to be fresh. We didn't even got our appetizers, lamb was undercooked and butter chicken was super oily. This is far from being Indian food it's junk!",1
If your from NY this is really the only place you are going to find pizza like back home. Don't listen to anyone else's suggestions of where to find NY style pizza. Believe me I have tried many and while some were good they weren't NY style you know what I mean! Save yourself time and agita and just go here you won't be disappointed.,2
"Terrific 'Q, outstanding beer selection, and a great atmosphere. My only complaint is the parking, which is pretty tight. I enjoyed the Brisket Sandwich I ordered, but wasn't thrilled when I realized it came with blue cheese. My fault not theirs. I plan on going back soon to try something a little more traditional.",2
"Driving range and putting green were closed for overseeding so we couldn't get any practice in.yeah, that's the reason for my high score. The other reason was the incredible amount of sand and water on the course. Course management is key here as opposed to grip it and rip it golf. Overall, it was a great course that I'd come back to play.",2
This new Thai RESTURANT is very authentic and everything I have eaten there is very delicious The service is outstanding I have eaten there several times since it opened I especially like basil fried rice green curry Duck noodle soup Everytime I try something new and never disappointed I will return soon very soon,2
"Awesome meal! I'm not normally a prime rib kind of person, but it being Lawry's specialty, I had to try it. I got the Lawry's Cut the most popular cut which is a 10 oz cut. It was tender and very flavorful. Put together with creamed spinach and some saut u00e9ed mushrooms and I was in heaven! Service was excellent. Atmosphere was very nice. Highly recommend this place.",2
"Not impressed. I found it odd that they had a full time security guard roaming the entire spa looking at everyone. Made things a little awkward when you want to relax. I also did not appreciate timing my 50 minute massage and having it clock in at just 41 very unprofessional. With so many other options in Las Vegas, I won't be returning to Qua anytime soon.",1
Ewww ewww ewww ewww! I love Nordstrom but not this one. Who would possibly shop here with so many other options in this mall. Terrible customer service especially that tall flamboyant guy in cosmetics department nWho needs to stay out of the sun. Cooked much? He's so rude. I'll go to Saks or Neimans just to not deal with his funky attitude.,1
"0 Stars if I could The new owner management is not customer focused. We walked in last Saturday at 9 00 am and there was not one customer in there. We inquired about getting two pedicures, the owner manager told us they couldn't help us because we didn't have an appointment. They were expecting their first appointment at 10 00 am. Needless to say we walked out and will not be returning.",1
"Can someone pinch me, I believe I've gone to heavan, I'm here having this Chicago Style pizza with Pepperoni, sausage, olives and mushrooms must I say more! Thanks Groupon, for this awesome deal. Came to Las Vegas on my way to Utah. Stopped to have lunch for my wife and I and man o man this humongous pizza of love came to our table dannnngggg!",2
"Went to get takeout last night, we live very close so was shocked to find food cold, not lukewarm but COLD and garlic knots were old stale and hard, salad was hardly worth it, not happy at all, for something that a business like this should be able to do very easy, they failed. We have eaten there a few times, I can honestly say, NEVER AGAIN!",1
"This place could not tell me what was wrong with my puppy, they wanted to charge me twice for the same issue and then when I asked about the charge told me that i just probably couldnt afford to pay. So upset with this I called HR do you think they cared to do anything NO! Please save yourself and animal by going to a better caring vet!",1
"Went here the other day and got the taro coconut boba. The actual boba was good. It was soft and chewy, which is how I like my boba. The taro coconut was blended and was grainy since they use the powder milk tea flavoring. The girl working the counter was very sweet and helpful. Overall, I enjoyed it and will try to visit again.",2
"What can I write that already hasn't? Excellent all the way around from service, pricing and taste! This time I had the catfish. Awesome cornmeal batter and flavorful catfish. I took a friend temporarily staying in Phx working that's from Montana. He wants to come back before he leaves. Oh, and great sweet tea also, not too sugary, just right!",2
"We have been here one other time, but we think it was even better this time round. nTook some friends and they loved it as much as we did. The flavors, the regions, all the fresh and organic ingredients, really made the food outstanding. nGood staff that is helpful in ordering the right combination of dishes. nDelicious and would recommend it highly and priced right.",2
"This has been my second time visiting the Wynn Buffet. Im not a big fan of buffet, but hands down to the Wynn! All the food options are amazing are very fresh. It is a tad expensive for dinner compared to other buffets, but in return it is definitely worth every penny. The dessert section is like heaven. I wished I had the stomach to try every single dessert.",2
"The staff are friendly and helpful. They seemed really concerned when my cat got sick. The doctor personally called me when my cat was in the hospital overnight because of kidney stones. They did follow up calls as well. Plus the doctor was named Sean Penn, though I don't think it was actually the actor. The hours are wonderful. I would recommend this business to anyone.",2
"Wow! Worst service ever! nWell first off our waiter Shawn went out and smoked pot about half way through our meal. He came back and reeked of weed! Then he forgot to get our drinks. Again, he was high. Then we had to go to the bar to get our waters refilled. Do you see a pattern here? Food was fantastic. Service was the worst! Probably won't be back! At least at Olive Garden you get good service.",1
"Tea was decent. Food was decent. I'd almost want to give this a 5 star rating for being in the south west area, since not many other things like this exist there. But the food wasn't super amazing. I probably won't put this on my regular list of places to visit. But I'll give it 4 stars for location and decency.",2
I am a big fan of Southeast Asian cuisine but I am supper picky as well. Many place have a tendency to bastardize Asian cuisine but this place does a great job of keeping it authentic as well as making it approachable to westerners. Super clean in restaurant and not overly decorated.which added to the relaxing vibe. Best beef pho in town!,2
"What a waste of money! Came here to grab a drink before heading out around noon. The bar was pretty empty, and of course the music wasn't on. The reason I give only two stars is because no one should EVER have to pay 32 for two simple mixed drinks. I ordered a Long Island, and my boyfriend got a Manhattan which was made wrong . 16 per drink?! and it didn't even taste that great.",1
"Front office whoever answers the phone are downright rude everytime. I will be switching doctors, as every call is unpleasant. Someone needs to give the front desk people some communication skills. Just had a follow up and they wanted me to fill out all the forms AGAIN! I'm done with them! If you want a pleasant office experience, you are NOT going to get it at their practice.",1
"If they tell you that you are staying in the ""courtyard "" runaway screaming! It was the most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed at. We checked in late in the evening so there was no option to change hotels that night, I slept on top of the covers with towels laid on them. We got up at 6AM and ran as fast as we could. Station Casinos should be embarrassed to call this part of their group.",1
"We've been sitting here at a table in the bar for 30 mins, 2 45 pm. Watched the bartender texting, gabbing, and hugging one of the customers. She finally took our order. Only 12 people here. Seriously crappy service. We use to love this place. Would not recommend this now. The food is still good though.",1
"This Coffee Shop smells so good and is a kinda cool spot for Hot Coffee. The Coffee was better than most of the places. I believe this place and the Coffee have potential! The place has potential because it has a comfortable, laid back feel. The Coffee has potential because the drink I had was pretty good and I think it can be better if I could figure out how to order!",2
"The problem my wife had was she booked a flight to Seattle using her frequent flying points. Last week she found out she would be unable to fly to Seattle, sloshed tried to cancel her flight and get her points back, unable to do this , but for a charge of 125.00 they would be able to do it. Such a lame excuse, why not give a credit for our next flight if you wish to keep us flying with Alaska.",1
"Ewwww. The shawarma was gross. I really don't know what Sababa uses for spice on this dish but STOP! And a really simple dish to make is Taboule.but somehow Sababa managed to put way too much bulgur into it. Very disappointing. Will NOT waste my money, my time or my taste buds on such lackluster middle eastern food again.",1
This is the only nail salon I will go to! I have tried many in the last few years but this nail salon wins by far! Sometimes it can be a little busy and I may need to wait 10 mins but it is worth it! Kim always sets the nail tips straight! Amy is my go to girl for my fills. I like my nails super short and she does them just how I like them everytime! Will be a loyal customer till the day I die!,2
"Following rappelling, it was time for lunch. We were looking for something light, healthy and filling. Well, we found it at GreenMix. Their portion sizes were huge. The food was fresh, the staff was very friendly and expeditious in getting your food out. This is a great place to grab lunch on the go or stick around and eat in house.",2
"I've been going to Floridino's for a few years, but I wasn't a huge huge fan until they started making buffalo chicken pizza muffins. They're wonderful. Now I understand why my family dragged me back so often. The pizza muffins are great. Floridino's has good salads and decent pastas, but the pizza muffins are to die for.",2
"good place for takeout, not the greatest place to eat in. we ordered tacos, rolled tacos taquitos, and had the agua fresca. food was good for the price, you can eat for about 5 bucks. as a girl i wouldn't go there alone at night, but i'm a wimp. nthere's a bunch of taquerias within a mile, and this is one of the better ones.",2
I had the leghorn chicken breast and it was pretty good. My hubby had the standard and he enjoyed it also. We both enjoyed the gourmet buns.thought it brought the burgers up a notch. The service was fast and friendly. For a burger joint our meal was a bit pricey.but hey this is Vegas and a meal for two under thirty bucks is kinda a bargain.,2
"I am a very easy going guy, I have been here 3 times and this place was horrible. Most of the ppl I speak to have also had bad experiences. From cold food to never not once having a decent waiter. Every few months I will try again to see if there have been improvements and still nothing. Eat at your own risk.",1
What a beautiful restaurant. Patio seating was great. Live music outside and our waiter Michael was the absolute best. We had the soup of the day chicken and roasted. Potatoes and it was fabulous. Hanger steak salad was good but would not get again. Nutella cake over rich for one person to eat but a chocoholics paradise.,2
"I've only ever been there in the afternoons, but I find the ladies there to be a little standoffish and sometimes rude. the guys at the counter always seem helpful. the pb j and cookies are good per my coworkers . overall, unless you need a special cake they're wedding cakes look beautiful , then any place else would be better. not so much talking down to you.",1
DO NOT USE THIS CAB COMPANY! If you have used them and have had damaged or stolen lost items I would like to hear from you. Please email me at unavita gmail.com. I used this cab to take from Wynn to my condo. As I got out of the car my clothes were torn. It's been over a year and they offered me 20 less than I paid for the damaged clothes which had been purchased a couple of weeks prior.,1
"I was very excited to try this place, but very disappointed. We had to clear our own tables after asking twice, which the girl at the register said ""I'll get someone out there when I can. "" The waitress lost one of the orders at our table and 2 at the table next to ours. The food was good, but I am not likely to return soon.",1
"Great food! Best Latin food I've had in a long time. Very authentic. So much so, they hardly speak any English. My only complaint is that the service is a little slow, but I guess that's to be expected when the owner and his wife are they only two people working there. I would recommend it to anyone wanting Latin food. Best place to eat in the area.",2
Bought floor sample on assurance of next day delivery as I was leaving town for 2 months. Next day no delivery and when I called it apparently was never scheduled. Huge waste of time and they expressly misled me to purchase based on delivery promise. I have cancelled and they agreed to refund. We will see if that comes through by email as agreed or whether there is yet another problem.,1
"Had an awesome time here, the saxophonist was great, his dad who used to sing with ray Charles was a true performer and my friend and I were thoroughly entertained, they involved the audience. The drinks were ok, I had to send one back because it just didn't taste good. But the waitress was cool. We had fun showing customers from other cities the Frankie Beverly and Maze shuffle!",2
"Horrible experiences at this store! Their bottom line seems to be to rake customers over the coals and squeeze every dime out of them they have. They'll lie to you, low ball you and laugh right in your face. Stay away from this dump. If you want quality service, Sam Ash is the place to go. Krusty the Clown must be their role model. nStay away, stay far away.",1
I had a water pressure regulator installed yesterday and it is leaking like a sieve. Trying to get a time commitment for the repair is like pulling teeth! Here I sit with a LEAKING pipe and a possible arrival time of tomorrow morning . To be continued Update Freddy did come back out that night and fix the problem.,1
"Great service and food here. everything is yummy. every their pizza are good. we ordered appl platter, gyro sandwiches, margarita pizza. it was amazing. I would highly recomend this place to anyone.they also have great lunch special and delivery too. One thing! no credicard ! cash only unless u want to pay extra 50 cent.",2
"Everything here is good. I guess we're all going to like our mother's kimchi so tastes do vary but for me this is like mom's kitchen. They never give me a hard time about ""looking white "" or speaking Korean with a perfect accent despite having blonde hair. If you are in Vegas and want real Korean food, imo this is the only option.",2
"I just made the switch to vegetarianism a few months ago, and have been scouting out some decent cuisine when I stumbled on Green today. I ordered the Spicy Po Boy, and damn if it wasn't the best Po Boy I've ever had! vegan or otherwise . Casual unassuming atmosphere with a bit of a beatnick vibe. I will definitely be going back to try the ""Drunken Chicken "" along with a Tsoymami desert!",2
"shrimp tempura came out cold and too much mayo. seabass has too much oil, could not taste salt or pepper, desserts are loaded with sugar and no caked choices .oysters was small and salty. all dishes are small portion and very expensive. they have costume girls dancing around but their out of shape body ruin every thing. after spending 437.00 for dinner for 2 persons, it not worth it.",1
"So. hostess was nice waitress was nice and even the cook was nice. But when it comes to food and service all I can think of is below average, the glasses and plates where dirty and the service was too long since that had only one girl working there and some of the food actually tasted different in a bad way then any other sushi place.",1
"Your typical Hyatt Place, which in my opinion is quite a good thing. Great room, bathroom, and WiFi.The staff was extremely friendly. The strip is about a mile's walk away. As usual with the Hyatt Place hotels, I have a complaint about their strange and limited TV channels. Otherwise, their TV and the system they have for connecting your own laptop or DVD player to it is great.",2
worse service ever if you wanna pay high prices for frys dogs eat here. even the frys brand dogs taste better looking to eat here please use cautioot family friendly half the people look like they are on drugs half the time smells like it in the shop please avoid this spot youll get better service and food at mcdonalds,1
"Had breakfast here for the first time. The food was really yummy and the service was excellent. Everyone was super friendly. The location may look a little scary from the outside, but it was very clean and comfortable on the inside and showcased a beautiful mural from a local artist. I will definitely go there again.",2
"NEVER EVER GO TO THIS LOCATION. At least not if you are planning to park in their parking lot. YOU WILL BE TOWED. Turns out they are working with Monster Towing Company, which has been scamming paying Jack in the Box customers for years.

"No thanks. One and done on a dare in early '08. Der, I do stoopid good every once in a while. nMy first room was an ""original "" yikes. nSwitched to a new one and breathed VOCs all night, yuck. nSmall casino, food, blah. Good connection from The Mirage to The Mall for some AC and a drink. nMight work for you though.",1
"Vaaaallllllcaaaaaannnooooo! Check out that fish tank! DAMN! What the heck? No Siegfried Roy?! White tigers? How much bleach do they use to keep them so white? Da rrrooommmss.ahhhhh.pleasant, comfort, quiet.nice. Nice package really, of course the last time I stayed here Siegfried and Roy were still work'n. The NY NY hotel was still being finished and the Desert Inn was still standing.",2
"Of all the Vigs, I like this one best The others are solid 4s so I guess that'd make this one a 5. Daily flatbreads are great. Hot Habby is a great habanero margarita. Chris behind the bar is quite amiable. We came hear for dinner with friends and had a great time. I visited more recently during happy hour, nice food specials.",2
"The food is delicious. I tried three types of bread naan and they were all very good. The Malai Kofta was awesome. Paneer Tikka Masala was very good too. And finally, I found a place in Phoenix that serves real Dum Biryani. nHaving said that, the reason I did not give a full five stars is because the staff including the manager seem very inexperienced. The service is very slow too.",2
"As always I just love firefly. The feel, the atmosphere, the people, tapas and of course. sangria! Perfect place and how can you not drool over those dates . Mac n cheese . Shrimp diabla. Sliders. the bread pudding. I could go on forever only bad part is deciding . love this restaurant. Lets not forget who started it all Vegas favorite for sure. Can't wait for my birthday!",2
"Really an amazing technological production the stage is amazing, the acts here are so creative. You cannot go wrong with Mystere or O in Las Vegas these are the top of the top shows in Vegas. The standby line in the Bellagio never fails to produce tickets to those who are patient, even for those nights that they claim they are sold out.",2
"Decor is one of a kind in Montreal. nPrices are average for St Laurent's bars. nGood variety of cocktails and shots. My advices nIf you don't know which one to pick, just get the Capricorn shot. nBest night to go Friday when DJ Mister Goodman is playing Mix of top 40, hip hop, house, 90's . Just go there, get a drink and dance like no one is watching.",2
"This has got to be the best discovery ever, sometimes the selection can be sparse as it is picked through, but OMG I bought 250 worth of cloths for 20, these are designer labels too.i think my problem will be quickly filling up my closet space.I don't make a tone of money, but the cloths I buy there you would think I'm rolling in dough.This place is awesome!",2
"Do yourself a favor and get one of the crazier poutines. I got the classic poutine, thinking that a classic poutine had meat on it. I was wrong. And do yourself a favor do not order the large poutine. No one needs that much food. This was a good place. I enjoyed my poutine, the service was good, and the price was totally reasonable.",2
"I love dunkin donuts. Their selection is great and they are located throughout the city. I love krispy kreme just as much but they have no locations anywhere, so if I need a few dozen donuts for my team members at work, I have no choice but to stop in at dunkin donuts. I am always very happy with their variety, quality and price. I'm not a fan of their coffee though",2
"2 piece chicken meal is the best deal in town. It's only 3.99, fills you up too. The chicken is amazing! It's bright red don't be afraid just tastes great, not overly spiced and extremely tasty! Meal comes with corn or flour tortillas, onions and beans. Though very simple, the beans are killer. Just go try it for lunch, can't go wrong.",2
Hell freakio. Do not come here. The food is nasty. I wasn't too hungry when I came with a huge birthday group so I ordered nachos. Nobody can get nachos wrong.nobody! Toss the cheese on top of the chips and presto! Haha wow was I being optimistic. My nachos came out completely cold. The cheese hadn't even melted yet. Are you serious?! Ugh. One of the worst meals of my life.,1
"Worst dry cleaners in the valley! They lost a pair of pants and then acted as if they did me a favor for finding them. No apology from the manager when I picked them up the next day. Quite frankly for what they charge, one would think they would offer superior customer service and a quicker turn around time than the 2.50 dry cleaners. I will never use Desert Ridge Cleaners again.",1
"Some great shops, but CRAZY hard to get your bearings, find the store you're looking for, or keep track of which ""aisles "" you've ""done "" and what's left to shop. for a sport shopper like me, that's incredibly annoying and tends to keep me away. Given almost all of these stores can be found in at least one other shopping center in Vegas.",1
"Wish I'd spent the extra and gone to Caesars instead. Was either tasteless or too salty and just seemed cheap?! nThe service was horrendous too. Didn't get a smile from a member of staff once, certainly didn't deserve a tip. nOnly good thing was the crab. I wouldn't bother spend the extra and get something memorable",1
"It's okay barfood for Campustown. The Haus Fries are amazing, the burgers are underwhelming, the booze is expensive for the serving size almost 5 for a weak vodka cranberry. really? Plus it gets loud at night. I think if I were an undergrad at U of I, I'd like the place, but seeing as I'm an old graduate student, I'm unimpressed.",1
"Horrible experience, the waitress walked by Nearly 10x and never made eye contact our asked us what we wanted. I've only ordered food During the day,but based off this experience I'll probably not come back for either. I don't feel like I should flag you down to do your job. I am here to relax not chase waitresses down. store Charlotte nc",1
"Long wait for a waitress to take our order and an inordinate amount of time waiting for her to bring two Guinnesses to the table. And then a long wait for the check. We were going to stay and order some food but bailed. I don't be back. No wi fi, or at least if there was, I wasn't able to connect to it.",1
"This is not my normal Target but I stopped by since I was ordering pizza at the Naked Pizza. They are re modeling so things are kinda of crazy in there. Not one employee greeted me or asked if I needed help. It is hard to find things at this place. I hope the place is nice, neat, and better when they finish remodeling.",1
"I love bookstores! There are only three B Ns left in town and I like coming to this one because it is convienent and the staff are super friendly! It's your typical B N bookstore, nothing special. Just go in and if you can't find anything you're looking for ask the staff and they'll be happy to help! Also a good place to study during the week too. ",2
"The rooms are very nice! The food court seems very far out of the way which is annoying, the casino seemed well kept and plenty of tables slots to enjoy, although we weren't really winning. The shark reef aquarium was fun. But small. 4 stars because it's a pretty nice place to stay in Vegas with plenty of food shopping entertainment to enjoy.",2
"Loved it! I had a turkey patty melt that was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of cheese and grilled onions and the best french fries crisp, thick, with just the right amount of salt made with canola instead of vegetable oil, which always tastes better. Service was good, and reasonably priced.",2
"I love this place. 1. Jack knows his business n2. He can do any clothing fabric you need customized n3. Screenprint, embroidery, stitched letters, everything n4. I can order from out of state and he'll ship it to me n5. He's fast n6. You can bring in your own piece of clothing or fabric n7. They've got all the sorority fraternity gifts waterbottles, keychains, tote bags, etc. in one spot",2
"Really a let down for such a great location. The menu never changes and the food never improves.after a dozen tries, we give up and will dine at other clubs in the area. If they hope to make it in the long run, a big face lift to the d u00e9cor is needed as well. With plans of thousands more home coming to this club, they better get with the times!",1
"Called to place an order to be picked up. Lady told me they were too busy to do it. What kind of services is that!? Ive called places where they say they're slammed and it might be a while, I can understand that. That at least gives me the option to order and wait or order from somewhere else. To me its rude, Ugh.",1
Great place to get a last minute bite before heading downtown. I usually get a lamb gyro or shawrma and they are both delicious! If i remember correctly you can add a order of fries for an extra dollar and change. Totally great deal especially because your food will be gone so quick. nA little bit on the expensive side but the food is made well and the lamb is juicy.,2
"I have always enjoyed Panera. Food is fresh and usually very good. Every so often you get something not as good as you expected, but that can happen almost anywhere. One thing I really enjoy is their fresh brewed iced tea. Always refreshing on the hot summer days in Las Vegas. I wish they would serve a traditional style breakfast eggs, meat, potato's with one of their fresh baked breads.",2
"Horribly regret coming to this place, all the veggies for the salad were dry and bitter. I should have asked for a refund then, but I pushed on. realizing that this is one of those gluten free places I quickly learned that gluten is essential in a lot of dishes cause everything tasted awful. the only thing good about this place was when I left, never to return again.",1
"Curious as to why they name their restaurant Arrowhead ""Grill "" when they broil there meat.not a fan. I have no problem paying a lot for a good meal that has great flavor and is palate pleasing. This food reminded me of what you would get in a cafeteria. nHostess was snotty, wait staff were nice, restaurant was quite loud.",1
"My least favorite post office. They're slow, never have enough help and the worst thing they did across the board was taking out the machines that sold postage stamps. Its even congested when u try to use the drive up to mail a letter. Its like people pull up to the mail box then fill out the envelope. I have my letter in hand and I always have to wait. shameful",1
"Dirty,smelly,ghetto and bad customer service! nI booked this hotel with hotels.com and I am very disappointed because when I booked it says no resort fee,but when I got there well surprise there was. So be careful when you use hotels.com nThis is my first and last time that I will ever step foot in this disgusting hotel",1
"I have only been to this Massage Envy location a couple of times but this last time was the best! I was able to make my appointment easily and we greeted kindly by the front desk staff. My therapist was great and did exactly what I wanted her to do, help me relax. Hummmm this reminds me, I need to make another appointment, time for my next massage!",2
"I am very particular about my Chinese chicken salad, not that I think the Chinese actually came up with the dish. Anyhow, it's not on the menu here, but trust me when I say it is very tasty, fresh, and portion is just right. Our waiter was a bit.preoccupied. only towards the end did we see the corner of his lip curl up to smile. Hence, the four star rating minus one.",2
We happened to come across back room burger after a morning at the spa and decided to take a chance. We are glad that we did. Our waiter Mutlu helped me choose my drink and I got the most wonderful marshmallow shake from the boozer menu. Our burgers were yummy and the service was spot on. Would come back here in a minute. Good job staff.,2
"Artie is our lifetime plumber! He's great! We've had him replace faucets, toilets, etc. all the work he's done has been excellent. Everything's working great everything looks great! On top of that, the bills we've received from him haven't had any surprises his quotes were accurate. I'd highly recommend Artie. We'll use him for all of our plumbing needs.",2
"Ridiculous! Tried to order the family box you get 1 topping per pizza. I wanted cheese for 1 of my pizzas, and 2 toppings on my other pizza. Said they couldn't do that. The computer wouldn't let them. I'd have to pay for the 2nd topping. Does that even make sense? Now they aren't getting my 25 order! All for a topping!",1
"The food is always amazing. The Palm Beach Salad is a longtime favorite because it's fresh and consistent. Crab, avocado, red onion, tomato, lettuce. The French dip is the most delicious steak sandwich. This time we had the Margherita Pizza which is thin, crunchy and tasty and the bread pudding is DELICIOUS.",2
This is what a bar is all about. Come as you are. I enjoyed every minute of it. The people are down to Earth and very friendly. Bathrooms were very clean and everyone was having a good time. Live Music was playing and drinks were cheap. If you're looking for a good time without all the glitz glam and snooties.this is the place.,2
"I am a HUGE ramen fan.came to Phoenix for a quick 1 day visit and had to try the ramen in AZ. Following the reviews on yelp, i decided to give this place a try. Big mistake. Ok, it's not horrible but ramen is hard to mess up on. I have had really really good ramen and this is nothing even close to it.",1
"Sooo much self loathing going on after eating here. Thank god for sweatpants and Tums. This place is super gimmicky and the food was not good. I couldn't believe the amount of people packed in here for subpar Mexican. The portions are huge, which I guess is a plus for some. But I'd much rather have quality over quantity.",1
"Hands down, one of the top 3 worst haircuts I have ever gotten. Atmosphere isn't warm or inviting, and I wish I had experienced the no show that the other reviewer had. Whenever I straighten my hair, tears well up at the hack job I got. Will never, ever go back. If I could post negative stars, I would.",1
"Mmmm. Best Mac 'N' Cheese I've ever had. Better than the one I make. With Lobster, Bacon, Sun Dried Tomatoes Toasted Breadcrumbs. Its the Thursday Special. Am thinking of going back next week for more of the same. If you have to wait, the line is into the Bellagio Conservatory, very pretty. Good service and not rushed.",2
"As much as I like to patronize local establishments and small business in general, Roman is more style than substance. Food portions are small, beer is overpriced and the service is hit or miss. Maybe it's just me being a young guy but as far as getting what you pay for, there is better quality and value to be had.",1
"So, I was contacted by the owner, Roberto, a few weeks ago apologizing for my icky experience. He offered resolution which I thought was great. But when I responded to him no response since. I called the store and a lady named Sam was very snippy and said ""he doesn't even come in. Email him I guess because I have no idea who you are. "" Nice. What a bummer.",1
"I'm so confused. I came to this place with a Groupon expecting myself a lunch. I pulled up to the location and there is not only a sign that said ""Closed for renovation "", but there was the name of another restaurant painted on the windows and on the billboard on the street. So did another restaurant take over this location?",1
Went here and tried a couple of different dishes. Was really average and the service was bad. I had the eel soup and . something else. See I forgot it already. It was breakfast time and I was less than impressed with the food or service. Mayne I caught them at a bad time or something. I see some stellar reviews on here and I just didn't get anything worth going back for.,1
"I'm staying at the Marriott City Center, but walked down here to catch the Hop On Hop Off tour bus. With 4 minutes to spare, and not a single coffee shop for blocks, I ducked in and asked if I could purchase a cup of coffee to go. No. I then asked if I could have one since I'm a Marriott customer. No. I'll never stay here because of that.",1
Always thought this place would suck monkey choad But it's pretty good. Not amazing but fast simple tasty. I do like most that the bread is very thin overall. I try not to eat much bread as it is so this is a big plus. I got the Italian I'm sure the meat is riddled with nitrates but I would go again if I was desperate enough.,2
Meh. The selection here was mediocre. I used to remember loving J Crew in high school. The quality and design has really gone downhill over the many seasons. They used to have great finds in the clearance section and now when I browse. I think that there is a reason why this thing is marked 90 off and still on the racks!,1
Last week was my first time in Las Vegas and my friend decided to take me to the Fremont Street Experience. It was cool but I rather stay on The Strip. Wasn't my type of scene and we ate at the Tony Roma's and the food was horrible. The only thing I like about Fremont Street was the zipline. Some of the people there was creepy and scary. Never again.,1
This buffet is definitely one of the best on the strip. I have ate at the bellagio buffet and the display is nicer but the cost is more as well. I love the variety! You can add unlimit mimomas and such for 15 extra which we definitely got our money's worth. I would recommend this 19.99 breakfast buffet to anyone!,2
"My husband and I checked out Yelp for a sushi restaurant, and Kawaii JC had the best recent reviews, even though it was a bit of a drive. We got here at 5 30pm for the happy hour, and got two 99 cent appetizers with drinks. We ordered a fried roll, a chef's roll and a regular free all were great! We're definitely coming back!",2
OMG! Horrible! Ordered Shrimp Scampi and it looked like they used Top Rameoddles. The pasta was very over cooked and the plate came out like a stir fry. This is my second trip to this place and both wee bad experiences. Forget the service it was what was expected for an Olive Garden but the food is just bad. Move on to somewhere else. This place is consistently bad.,1
"Oh Molly, Oh Molly, where art thou Oh Molly. We've only tried this place ponce since the closure of Molly Braniganns. Not much has changed except for poor food. The atmosphere is still about the same. You do get an English bar feel when inside, but the food has gone south. If you're out for drinks only and can take advantage of their happy hour, it might be for you.",1
My wife and I bought tickets online in advance to the park. We came on Halloweeight for Scarowinds. Well we were here for 30 minutes before rain and lightning came. We went to guest services and they told us there are no refunds. If you plan on going to this park make sure to check the weather or kiss your goodbye.,1
My connecting flight back to San Francisco was at Charlotte Douglas International Airport which was cool because my walk to the terminal was less than 2 minutes and the airport was really clean. I still prefer Texas connecting flights since flying across from East coast to West isn't fun. I hate sitting on a plane for more than a few hours but as long I reached my destination I'm good and on time.,2
"Not the quality education I was looking for. nThe professors are disorganized and can NOT teach, especially lab. nIn particular, CHM 151LL and 152 LL Dr. Indu Mishra will take off points for no reason even for a perfect lab report. nInconsistency in grading, students with less accurate data end up with higher grades on the lab reports. nRun the other way while you can.",1
"I highly recommend Bouchon for breakfast. Get there early for outdoor seating, the strawberry crouissants, and their specials. The hot chocolate is delicious, too. I went twice on my last trip. On both occassions, the staff was very polite and formal, but not too formal. The prices seemed very reasonable, as well.",2
We had the lunch special at Z's after enjoying the golf tournament at Desert Mountain. It was a gorgeous day and we were able to eat outside on their patio. We had a small salad with a tasty ginger dressing. Our entrees included the pad Thai and Kung Pao Chicken. They were both delicious! We would definitely make the trip out to Cave Creek to eat there again.,2
"Ate here today with my 8 year old. Multiple staff members were hanging around in the dining room cursing within a few tables of where we were sitting. I don't want to have to explain what the F word is over supper. Eggplant parm. sandwich super greasy. Pizza is NY style, but sauce was bland. First time eating here. We won't be back.",1
"Amazing, just amazing! They really go the distance. I had a complex gate install and they knew how to handle every curveball. These guys suffered through incredible heat but still took the extra time to make sure the job was done right, it was fully tested, and they walked me through everything. Awesome! Highly recommended. A !",2
"Yum! Great service and even better food. Diverse menu with a generous host of daily specials. Warm goat cheese salad was superb. Pulled pork BBQ excellent as well.fries and salad served with most sandwiches which I appreciated. Great atmosphere, fresh air and plenty to look at on the walls with all the artwork. I will return! Good selection of draft beers, was happy to find Carlsberg and Guinness.",2
"Great breakfast and lunch spot! Its open on Saturdays now and later during the weekdays which is great cause I always need a great breakfast spot close by. Nicole the owner, is amazing and will let you customize anything off the menu. Stop by and help support a local business they are about to start their 7th year!",2
Tourist Trap and Worst Pub Ever! Place looks like a poor version of a pub set not a real venue and the service was horrible had to hunt down on straw and napkins . Most of all it was far beyond overpriced. Case and point watered down double shot of Bailey's was 20! Was excited but now disappointed that this place got our money!,1
"Cheap, . and nicely done overall! nNothing fancy but for a delivery in HoMa its as good as it gets. nRavioli Hunan are always my favourite here. nSeems like an insignificant detail but its so fun to be understood quickly over the phone. They speak good french and english and japanese I presume! nAnd that's an extra star for me.",2
Even by airport standards this place is a huge rip off. I paid 6.25 for some hummus and what did I get? Two small 1 ounce containers and 2 pieces of ciabatta cut into 4s. I get more ketchup with a small order of fries then this place gave me hummus. The fact that it was horrible tasting hummus didn't make me feel better. Avoid at all costs and get a better deal at NYPD right next door.,1
"The place is small and dark , I like to see what I'm eating . The green tamale were OK but the sauce was blah. The beans were cold , but salsa was ok not great but ok.We never got the same server twice. One of the server look like she hated her job she never smile. It would have beeice to felt welcome not like a bother.",1
Ordered a caramel macchiato and a bagel. I have to say this is the absolute best bagel I have ever had. It didn't look like anything special but 1 bite told me this was not store bought. It was soft and fluffy almost like a croissant. It did take around 10 minutes to get the bagel but after tasting it I didn't mind. The staff was courteous and polite. I will definitely be bringing my friends here.,2
"I took my laptop in because it had a virus. They had to wipe the hard drive and re install. From this point, I caot hook to my wireless modem in my house. They said there is nothing they can do about it, stared at me until I left. This was the second computer I took to them. Once they do what ever it is they do, they leave you hanging. Not a good company, not helpful, down right rude.",1
My family and I had been seated and we waited for 15 minutes for someone to take our orders. No one even offered us a drink. My dad had called for someone to take our order but none of the servers gave us any recognition. We then walked out and no one eveoticed. They obviously do not no how to serve their customers.,1
Well let's just say ihop has taken last place in food. I came here for breakfast and the fruit that I got well was. Gross. Both gross looking and tasting. You can tell it was frozen. The eggs are not real eggs they are a fake gray looking color. The only thing that was good on my plate would be the toast. Not going back.,1
"Meh. I've experienced better. Not that it was bad.just underwhelmed sp? . You can go next door meaning their sister mexican restaurant and get stuff from the same kitchen, cheaper. I had the pan fried chicken.it was tiny and just okay. They are teetering on getting one star if the prices were too much more than what they were. Bar looks nice for cocktails.",1
"The second refinishing business I have had to give a poor review to. Apparently these businesses are too busy to respond to emails requesting an estimate. Apparently they are too busy to bother with a small job. Truly disappointed, but the place I DID receive a response from is awesome. I will continue to use their services, and NOT these others, including Allison's.",1
This place is not what you would think! It seems to be a locals joint. We happened to hit happy hour which consisted of 2 for 1 draft beer till 7. Appetizers were between 3 and 5 dollars. We had chicken wings and nachos and both were better than I expected. The food portion of happy hour lasts until 6 o'clock. I would definitely recommend this place!,2
"Came back here again for a quick pedi without all the bells and whistles and that's exactly what I got. The polish is all messed up, not even in color and most piggies are missing polish on the sides making my nails look freakishly skinny. Oh, and the burn they gave me last time I was in gave me a scar. Blah.",1
"Yeah, Yama Sushi truly deserves the four stars. Other thaot having special fish like super white tuna which is served at Sushi Mon , Yama Sushi has pretty some exotic fish that you might fancy. I do especially enjoy the quaint atmosphere and the super nice service from Stella. If you are on the eastside, then go ahead, give Yama Sushi a try. I know I will come back for sure.",2
"Came here later on a Saturday. Service was good, food not so much. Mac n cheese for my son was clearly kraft out of a box. Daughters Parmesaoodles undercooked, ""bruschetta salad "" was a feeble attempt with tiny pearl Mozzarella was incredibly disappointing. Stuffing as side for for turkey was clearly out of a box. Not at all what I expected, but again, server was nice.",1
"This could be the worst food I have ever had. The fact that people wait in line for this defines that many people either do not have any taste buds or simply do not care how there food taste. My wife and I both ate one bite out of the meals and that was it! nUnless you are only trying to feel a void this is the last place to come. Sorry farm house, need to work on the food!",1
AMAZING. Definitely one of the coolest ice cream places I have ever been too. I tried all the unique flavors and ended up with the Campfire S'more Sundae with both the honey bleu cheese and salted butter caramel ice creams. The homemade marshmallow on top was soooo good. Its quite a drive for us and it wasn't cheap but we will go back on special occasions!,2
"Went here on a Friday and a Sunday nite while in Vegas. Friday nite, DJ was AMAZING. Dance floor was packed inside, and we also started a little dance party outside. Patrons were fun and friendly. Sunday nite was empty and quiet, very lame and we left soon after. No cover charge for ladies though, which was great. Will definitely return on a Fri or Sat!",2
"Just went to this restaurant around 5PM on 9 28 13. stood around for a few minutes pacing the register area and saw no employees. No one at the front register, drive thru or cook stations. This place is always dead. Perhaps if there were people that actually worked, they'd have more patrons. So disappointed as I really wanted some chicken tenders ",1
This is a local dive bar with great bar food. Very friendly bartender and fellow patron. If you want to have a conversation folks will indulge you in some talk. Cheap cold beer. The wings and BLT was right on. The only complaint I would have is the wings are 1 extra if you want them grilled after they come out of the fryer. Good place before or after a Cubs spring training game.,2
"went on a friday night. it was EMPTY wtf. the band playing was too loud, and the lead singer must have thougt hes Bon Jovi in the 80s. or Axel dunno. Anyways, there were neither any guys, nor aifroce guys there. If anyone knows where to hang with airforce guys, PLEASE let me know. Our shots were way too expensive. just saying. The other prices where ok for beer and tequilla mixers.",1
"I've been to this location twice and both times, they got my order wrong. It consisted of only two toppings. I order simple pizza all the time and this is the only location thats messed up my order consistently. The service was fast, but not accurate. I think I'll search around for other places since I'm still new to the area.",1
"It's been awhile since I've been here now living elsewhere , but I remember the honey BBQ chicken wings and the garlic bread with such fondness. They were sooooooooooo good, I miss those two menu items. While I've had good garlic bread in CA, I have not found the same caliber honey BBQ wings. It was a great after the game hotspot for some really good, fun food.and YUMMY.",2
"Had the 3 course tasting menu. n1st Course Lobster artichoke salad nRack of NZ lamb nChocolate souffl nI was sorely disappointed in my first and desert! The ambiance was cool and the concept of the wine angels was innovative, but I did not see anyone get any wine in the vault at all, during our 3 hour meal. The wine menu was also supercool, but the food stinks. The help was great though.",1
"Fantastic experience, the staff are very friendly and welcoming. They do help you feel relax even knowing you will jumping 855 feet downwards. The price is 109 but thereare discounts for guests and military. Overall I had a blast if you're thinking of doing it just do it! Just don't hesitate while you're on the platform, it's the fastest way down",2
"I'm a huge fan of Top Chef. So when Elia finished fourth or so came out after our meal and right to us, it was quite surreal. I am not sure if she thought I was someone else or not. But I got a photo anyway. If not for the Elia experience, perhaps the food wasn't that great. But still above average breakfast fare.",2
"The menu is large and looks like it is full of enticing options, but the food was just so so. I really liked my server Zach but I could have done without the patio furniture you have to sit on in the dining room. Overall, you get the feeling these guys want to be exclusive fine dining but the dining room feels like the kid's table at thanksgiving.",1
"Unfortunately, the food was less then mediocre at best. We both ordered their cheese ravioli and after the first bite we both determined that it had been cooked in the same water that had had some type of seadfood cooked in it. The taste of shellfish was very evident. Also, their bruschetta was not good at all. I would not recommend the restaurant.",1
This is a review of the nightclub. Its def crowded but getting in is relatively straightforward and hassle fee and the crowd is above average. Its plenty huge but with enough different spaces to make it feel a little smaller than it really is. The bottom line is that if you go with a group of friends you should have fun. The music is above average as well.,2
"Very nice hotel. Its one of the easier hotels to get in and out of if you don't mind using the Valet. My wife and I think that is has some of the best places to dine on the strip. especially with a nice lake view. Prime, Olives What we like most is that it is upscale, but not overly snooty. It really feels like this place is more grown up yet still has places for the younger crowd.",2
"I rarely go to Indian restaurants. But this is a place I love to visit often. The food seems as if it was done with great interest. When u go there, order anything with rice. They cook it to perfection. I like their handi dishes a lot. If there is one thing I can suggest, it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes. No need to guild this Lilly!",2
Rude service and SO OVERPRICED like more than usual . nExample Heirloom tomato salad 2 small tomatoes chopped into 6 pieces with sauce. delicious but for 13 c'mon . Skip the salads as the portions are small. Burger was fine. Don't come here. And beer selection is hysterical for a place who thinks they serve unique craft beers.,1
"They lost my pants for two of my suits and refuse to reimburse me or replace what was lost. The owner repeatedly screened my phone calls to avoid speaking with me about the issue. He would never even let me get a word in during our first phone call and kept insisting that I had misplaced it. Now I have two, nicely tailored suit coats sitting in my closets without pants. Don't use this company.",1
"For the kitsch factor, for something to do for a day, this place is fine. It's got games and the carousel bar and cheesy circus acts. But it's dirty, it's run down, it's poorly planned, and I wouldn't stay here if my life depended on it. OK, MAYBE then. I tell people who come to visit all the time to not be taken in by the cheap rates here and at the Tropicana. There's a reason WHY they're cheap.",1
"The service was quick but these guys charged 1000 for a job that took less than 90 mins and no material cost. They called me at 8 30am to get into the building, left a message on my cell at 10am that said they were done. They resat a window that was popping out. Call around and get bids for your job before letting Fast Glass on Sandhill Rd do the job.",1
I passed through here looking for something to eat for lunch and promptly left. Nothing looked appetizing at any of the food stalls. Whats up with all the crappy food at this place? The pizza looked like a complete rip off. I must be turning into a picky ass mofo eater cause I swear unless the food is cooked fresh and the best ingredients are used I don't want to get near it.,1
The lamb is great so was the dark chocolate moose. I love finding these hidden Vintage restaurants in Vegas. The area is dicey but more props to for keeping it going so long. The price was a bit high for the food I feel since they are not located on a beach front or in a casino. My duck was a little dry. However I really enjoined the personality of our server and the place.,2
never tried this place because we always go to china a go go next door. i had the grilled mahi mahi and the chicken combo.both very good and comes with alot of food. rice was good and so was the macaroni salad. i was very happy with how good the food was. if you havent tried give it a shot a solid choice!,2
"After just one visit I can already say that Edens will be our ""go to place "" for kabobs and other Mediterranean dishes. The atmosphere is warm and friendly as is the staff. Dinner was served fresh and hot and it was delicious! My wife and I had to bring leftovers home and they were just as good for dinner the next night. Definitely try this place if you like fresh, well prepared Mediterranean!",2
"Black cashier takes his sweet time and chats making a long line to purchase items. Was rude when I asked him to pick up the pace. Gave rude comments, was about to punch him in the face but was really in a hurry. I asked for his name and manager's number. didn't give the number. I will go to corporate and complain to get his ass fired.",1
I went to this cleaner for convenience. What a mistake it was. They absolutely destroyed my favorite dress. It went in perfectly fine and came out pink! The woman told me it was not her problem and that they weren't a magic shop! Absolutely terrible service. I have had the dress cleaned before with absolutely no problem. Use at your own risk.,1
"I've experienced several spa services at Kneaded Relief and I just can't justify the cost compared with other spas around town. The prices of their massages and waxes are higher than what I am used to for similiarly skilled talent in Madison. It's a lovely environment, but I can't help but feel like I'm paying a bit too much.",1
"I've been to now two locations and love it the same every time. We always order the Chicago and are always pleased. My family is from Chicago and have found our very own taste of home every time we go here. service is great and quality needs no explaining. I already miss the city, but know a memory is only around the corner. try it yourself. thank me later",2
"The plumber and his work were fine. The price, not so much. Cost of O Ring is 71 CENTS each. Cost to install on 3 toilets. 345. Let's review. Materials cost is a total of 2.13. Time spent doing repairs 1hr. So I paid the plumber 342.87 for 1 hr of labor. I believe that will help you when you call and they ""can't give you an estimate over the phone "".",1
"This place was great until we tried to pay. The server became very rude and tried to make us order extra while we were waiting for our bill, she then gave us multiple dirty looks until we left. Also, my friend got food poisoning here from the onion rings. The burgers are expensive and average. Not the best place to eat.",1
"I, like most people are very leery about getting ripped off, when it comes to car repairs. I thought my brakes were in for a major repair and major . I was told the rear brakes were fine and the front brakes would not be a major repair. They did a great job at a fair price and even fixed no charge a panel above the front wheel well that had popped out! nHighly recommended.",2
"I was frantic when my engagement ring broke 1 week before my wedding. I had no idea what to do and who wants to get married with a broken ring? I called Fast Fix and they repaired, rhodium dipped and cleaned my ring for me io time! The price was very reasonable and the customer service was excellent. I was so impressed and relieved! I won't go anywhere else for my jewelry now.",2
"Good solid lunch at a decent price. The build your own options give you a chance to make healthy choices and the wonderful sides answer the call for fried comfort food. nNot sure what the fuss about service is? Each time I've been during a busy lunch, the staff has handled everything proficiently. nSweet potato fries and black bean burger are a MUST TRY!",2
"This is actually one of my favorite airports.especially if you have a lot of time to kill between flights. There are great food options all over the airport, plus a really beautiful atrium with dozens of rocking chairs where you can take a load off and people watch for a while. The business center is great in a pinch, too!",2
"I wouldn't recommend this buffet. The customer service is terrible. It's tough to eat at a buffet without a single water refill. nAlso, I got a pretty serious case of food poisoning soon after. I'm quite certain that the shellfish was the culprit. On the positive side, the selection was very good. Not a great experience overall.",1
was there last weekend. ngot free two nights to spend at Caeser Palace. nI did not expect too much before I arrived. nand it came out that it exceed my expectation. nme and my friends love almost everything in this hotel and we spent great two nights there. ni would definitely go back in the future. nspecial thank to Claire Yang. thank you so much for arranging a super nice view for my stay.,2
"The Agaean club sandwich, if I spelled it correctly, is friggin' huge, and amazing, as are the Greek style frnch fries.stunning fries of the finest caliber, but you HAVE to ensure they are the GREEK style from the menu. The flaming Greek cheese is absolutely amazing, as well as the hummus cannot go wrong with the hummus.",2
"These guys are the best. Simply the best. From stamps to shipping an iPhone, they really actually care that you get the best packaging for the best price. By using many different shipping companies, they are able to give you many options. Very old school service that I love, especially coming from a small town.",2
"Facts They will cut corners in every way. Materials, labor, and skipping critical steps during the process. Like not painting or at least priming walls prior to new finish materials. Covering up mold on existing walls. I took pictures of their tile guy using blue masking tape to cover large gaps in drywall pryer to tiling them. Abusive to employees, suppliers, and customers.",1
"I have had only good experiences at LaserAway! I purchased my services on Groupon and got a huge deal! The girl there are super friendly and never look at me like I'm asking a crazy question. I like that they are never running late, and almost always offer you a water bottle when you arrive. I highly recommend LaserAway Scottsdale!",2
"I'm a huge Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza lover. Having eaten it in Chicago and all over the country. With that said this place serves a very good pie and I highly recommend them. By the way in Chicago you'll get a buttery thick cornmeal crust, lots of garlic, chunky tomatoes. Just like at this place. Good stuff.",2
"Online ordering is great. Ordered in the morning for 5 15 pm pickup. Walked in around 5 15 was told they made a mistake. I expected the worst. Not only was the pizza ready, they gave me the pizza not made according to my order for free. Great job exceeding my expectations. Pizza as always was excellent.",2
"We randomly ended up here while driving through Pittsburgh. We absolutely loved it! I had the Pittsburgh style salad with buffalo chicken. One of the best salads I've had in awhile! The house burger was too big to be true see photo , but to die for! Service was great! Only complaint was the meat to bun ratio on the cheese steak sandwich.",2
"Yum! The enticing aroma and cozy location will draw you into the Baked Potato Shop! The toppings are fun and they are no joke bout adding butter to each spud! I order the medium thinking it was a for a medium sized potato but i was served two medium sized spuds! And with topping of cheese and pineapples pre supper snack became dinner. It was good though, very tasty and delish!",2
"Mmmm. paper thin crust. Love the sausage with light sauce. I will warn you it is not very filling, but mighty tasty. Again, note they are only open Thursday through Sunday. Absolutely delicious pizza! We have ordered from here for over 15 years. My wife and her family for over 20! As long as Johnnie is around, the quality and taste just can't be beat!",2
"Perfect, Prefect, Perfect. This is an amazing restaurant. The food is perfectly made, the location is perfect and the service is perfect. Every time I go to Las Vegas I always stop by this place for lunch. Relax for a few hours in the outdoor seating while you see the Bellagio's fountain across the way.",2
"Meh. I was here for a private party. It's a large space. Plenty of room to move around. The stage area was alright, but far from good. There were plenty of bars, so getting a drink was always easy. The beer selection was meh. The food spread was pretty awful. I can't say how it would be here on a typical night. However, based on my private party experience, I would go in with low expectations.",1
"This place ok, just ok, the wings were ok, the fries were ok, nothing to write home about. The prices were not so great either. Also its a thing with me, a wing joint should not charge extra for blue cheese dressing or for celery carrot sticks. All in all there are better wings out there, now go and find them! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",1
What a waste of money. I've seen better light shows exhibits. This was too crowded and pathetic to merit 14. Not that the lights looked bad there was just no reason to pay money to see them. I just cannot understand why this attracts as many people as it does. I only ended up there because I had time to kill before a late dinner reservation and was in the area. Please don't waste your time.,1
"If you are a baseball fan then this has a major leage team with a smallville field. Every seat has a great view and the prices are sooo affordable. Weather in AZ is hot . but it's a dry heat an in the spring, it's comfortably cool. If you drive from CA, the gas prices are about 50 cents cheaper so don't forget to fill up before you cross over to Cali.",2
"The cashier here was very rude last time I went. I didn't even complete my order she was so rude, I just left. Looking online at the nutrition facts, I am glad I left, there is basically nothing on the menu I feel comfortable eating after looking at the information on how horrible their rubbish they serve as food really is.",1
"Walked in and was told ""to wait a minute while we check on a table "".for just two! Place is empty! Sat waiting for hostess to finish talking to her friends visiting her at work. No effort to ""look for a table. "" Managers that came to front allowed her to carry on, and they neither made an effort. Walked out and chose Red Robiext door, much better choice. nZero stars if it allowed me to.",1
"Hearty breakfast where locals go. It's got a country side vibe. Relatively cheap and large portions. Service was really quick, in and out in 30 mins. Great place to go if you're in Vegas and on a budget or if you don't wanna wait 1.5 hours for a trendy brunch place. Recommend omelettes are okay, get a skillet. Crappy OJ is 3.25!",2
"Exceptionally slow service. This is now the second time that our crepes have taken over 25 mins to get out. The first time we were one of 3 people at the restaurant. This time though, I even saw the crepes being pulled out of a drawer. If you aren't making the crepes fresh, then why does it take so long? Adding chocolate and marshmallows isn't that time consuming.",1
"Really ?! 5 stars! I smell a set up. The owner and staff have never beeice, or polite or respectful to anyone. He once chased a customer down the street ""screaming like a little girl "" to the customers. No one in the valley has received reviews this good. Dont believe them he must have had his little "" kiss ass chorus "" write them. What a joke!",1
"We were rushed from the time we sat down, their goal was to get us out as quick as possible, for the price we were not happy with RM Seafood. Continued upsell became uncomfortable. For the price of RM Seafood I would find another place, especially in Vegas. The nosie level and the close seating is not a place to have a conversation with you dinner partner.",1
"This is the worst shabu place ever! if you have ever eaten any decent shabu, you would know that this place is the worst! DO NOT EAT HERE! they serve you on a portable gas stove. When we went, we were the only customers at the time but still took forever to bring out the food. Do not waste your money here!",1
"I have to admit finally it tasted like home, delicious russian food and mediteranian, great quality hookah and long lasting. Karaoke night was a blast for our company and we definitely had fun ! I have to say I will not only come back but feels like Im a resident here two thumbs up and much success for these ambitious owners !",2
NEGATIVE 2 STARS! So when I think of starbucks I think of friendly quality service. Well u wont geit that here. Their Drive threw took FOREVER. longest wait time ever. And then on top if the Long wait they gave me the wrong thing. I was royally pissed. There is a starbucks Drive right down the street passed the freeway. And they are excellent. But this location sucks!,1
Great night out. Had the set course menu. Some dishes were sublime particularly the fois gras with gingerbread others missed the mark a little. This restaurant has one M star. So it wasn't going to be bad. Lack of a knowledgeable somelier was the main disappointment. There are definitely better restaurants without the star but I definitely go again.,2
A few months ago I bought 2 tires from Big Ole Tires for 100.00 each with included balancing and installation. I seen a discount tire add on the Internet for 67.00 each great deal so I thought. I went there after purchasing 2 more tires and got charged 60 installation. The grand total came out to be 214.00 for two tires. Buyers beware Discount Tire adds do not account for installation.,1
Do not buy the Groupon for this place. They will charge you an extra 15 dollars per day for each visit for a small sample pack for the facial portion. The groupon is just another way to get you in the door and then they can up sell you. You could just walk in and ask for a guest pass and try the services for free for a day instead of buying a groupon.,1
"This is a hotel bar, so it has per definition hotel bar prices. This makes this place not up to a comparison with other bars in the area however with that being said, this place is nice. I killed some time in the bar and had great service and decent drinks. If I ever stay at this Mariott, then I am sure I will come to this bar. For sure.",2
"I've been here three times now for a mani pedi and eyebrow wax. If you get just the basic mani pedi w the waxing it comes to 41, which I find reasonable. Service has always been good, I am helped as soon as I walk in and have never waited more than a few minutes to start the services. The facilities are clean and well kept, and it is a friendly atmosphere.",2
"Great experience. Going in to buy plants at the beginning of January didn't sound like a great idea, but Pike Nurseries had everything I was looking for. Staff was helpful without being pushy. Beautiful store, clean and well maintained. I found this location on Yelp and it was a GREAT find! A big thanks to Martine sp for helping me in the store!",2
This place is so inexpensive but so disgusting. I had nachos and the portions are so small and there was barely any cheese. My mom had a latte and it was basically a bit of coffee mixed with a shitload of milk. I've never had coffee so greasy before. It's a great place to sit and watch the fountain show though. Maybe my review is bad bc I'm not of drinking age yet and couldn't try the daiquiri?,1
"If you're attending an event at the convention center, the convenience is perfect. However, the rooms are in appalling condition. My ""newly renovated room "" had new carpet, yes, but the shower has gunky and broken tiles, my toilet was dirty, and a piece of the window broke and was taped to the window instead of fixed. I will try to attach images.",1
"If you have ever had ramen in So Cal Santouka and Shin Sen Gumi Hakata for example , you'd know this place does not measure up at all. My Miso Ramen was thick and salty. It was more like gravy than soup. My fiance's Gyoza tasted like they were bought from the asian supermarket. While the botton was cooked, the top was still cold. Bad choice for dinner.",1
"Me ""Do you have any squeegees? There aren't any out by the pumps. "" Attendant shrug ""People take them. "" Me ""Do you have any more? "" Attendant ""No. "" I fill up then go back in. Me ""Do you have a restroom I could use? "" Attendant ""No. "" Me ""There's no restroom? "" Attendant ""We have a restroom, but no key. "" Me ""How does that work? "" Attendant shrug ""Someone left with the key. """,1
"four stars only because the calamari is too good it's soo expensive. i like the bbq meat and egg roll on vermicelli noodles. my mouth is watering just thinking about it nOH and definitely DO NOT GO ON sunday between 9am 3pm. it's like rush hour. we went last sunday and i couldn't even make it to the front door. unfortunately, we left. but it's not enough to keep me away for good",2
"While the makeup and effects are cool the 20 minute tour is light on scare considering the 43 ticket price. The tour ends at what they call the ""Baby Doll Lounge "" which was really only a balcony and some tables. I wouldnt recommend it Im sorry to say. They could improve the scares with metering the people in smaller batches.",1
"My boyfriend has been in the hospital the past few days, we were both tired of the food. I found 88 on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Glad I did! They delivered a great meal to the hospital. Their level of customer service was outstanding. Very helpful with providing information. They even accommodated the special dietary directions his nurse had provided. The meal provided by 88 delicious!",2
"My daughter booked and paid for a water slide for my grandsons 5th bday party.go to pick it up and they rented to someone else! After she had already paid for it! Party is tomorrow and no slide! They are a sorry excuse for a business! Take your money and go elsewhere! Just because they say they'll have it, doesn't mean they will. I would have gave them no stars but on yelp u have to give one.",1
"Now I know why I haven't been back to Eddies for awhile, because it's ran by a bunch of amateurs. After waiting for 45 mins after our reservation, we decided it just wasn't worth it. We really have never liked how they hide their food with all of his sauces. We gave it a shot and decided that with all of the other great restaurants in Scottsdale why waste our time with the amateurs.",1
"My family and I just ate at the Fox sports bar and experienced the most awful meal of our entire vacation. Everything was like it was out of a can or frozen bag. In fact, I've had better from cans and bags. Definitely eat anywhere else. Walk little further and you'll have many more and much better choices .",1
"Food is pretty good just what u expect from a Chinese buffet. The sushi isn't sushi Japanese restaurant quality but is better than most buffets I've been to they have 10 12 different types of rolls . The grill is pretty good aswell have a variety of veggies,meats and noodles . Keep in mind this is a buffet and u won't get restaurnat quality food but for a buffet i think it's pretty good ",2
"i have never had a better massage than i have at this salon.trankie is a pro. it is clean, friendly, and they carry great product. it is probably the best full service salon i have ever been to, including a lot of the major spas in las vegas and scottsdale. every service i have used there is top of the line, including facials, nails, and hair. great people. npat nscottsdale",2
"The seating at the bar is nice when the weather permits. Food is OK. Everything is the San Tan Village area is ""chain food "", so a somewhat decent place amongst the others. Staff is not very friendly at the bar. Unfortunately not a lot of choices in the area, having a patio makes this place a better option than many of the others.",1
"The Stetson Chopped Salad gets 5 stars. Have to have it at least once per visit each year I'm in Scottsdale for Spring Training. And, it is so easy to make at home. An added plus this year we ate at the bar. When I ordered a third glass of champagne the pour, from the end of the bottle, was about an inch shy of full. So, the bartender comp'ed it. ",2
Me and a friend ordered some breakfast a few months ago. The service was ok and I would've given them 4 or 5 stars but the waitress forgot to supply us with eating utensils. We had to hail down a staff member to get it. I'll give this place another chance but if they fail to meet basic expectations I'm done.,1
Not THE best pizza I've ever had but the best pizza in the area Try the pesto pizza! For about 7 you can get 2 slices and a drink. Not that bad. Whole pies are a bit pricier than the corporate go to's but this place is way better and the pizzas are HUGE as well as the slices ! They're deserts are really good too and they have a really large selection of drinks. Yummmmmyyyy!,2
"We had mother's day brunch and overall this place was a fail. The buffet was 16.95 person tax 18 gratuity. Over priced! My water glass was refilled only once, our dirty plates weren't taken until we asked, our silver wasn't replaced and the buffet selection was unimpressive. No omelet bar or anything beyond basic buffet.",1
"This place was awful! The service was good but the manager seemed like he was constipated or appeared to have a stick up his ass. The taste of the steak wasn't the best. And on top of it, my poor mom got food poisoning. nServer was a total doll though. DO NOT GO HERE! Go to Texas Roadhouse, cheaper and service and food is much better.",1
Rude and unwilling to correct mistakes. The delivery guy was nice but dont bother asking for your sauces for the dishes you ordered. It's one thing to make a mistake that happens. It's another thing to deny it and then fail to correct. I'll never have to argue with the woman in the phone that is in charge again.,1
"I have to tell you that I love T.G. I. Fridays. The food is great.especially their Jack Daniel's grilled selections. .but this location has the worst service of any food chain in the northwest valley. I drive across to the Friday's at 59th Avenue and Bell so that I can have someone actually come see that I am there within 20 minutes, maybe take my order and refill my drink once or twice.",1
"I love Euproea. If you treat dinning as an experience as opposed to just good food, you will love it too. I was surprised and delighted for all the gifts from the chef. It was fun and creative. The food is great too. I don't think it is too expensive given the amount of variety you will receive. Try the tasting menu. It will be a fuight you will remember ",2
"Poor and dismissive treatment by the host. We arrived at 7 and were told that we could be seated at 9 45. We gave our name believing we had made a reservation and held off on dining elsewhere. When we returned at 9 30 the same host who took our reservation acted as if she had never set eyes on us, said we were not in the reservation book and showed no sympathy or concern. Unacceptable.",1
"The cosistancy of this place is a ridiculous. Don't go on the weekend after 4 they close at 6 and they will continue to take customers to get the extra buck but your service will suffer. I paid for my brows to be waxed and they are just as hairy now, my mani and pedi are half a. too! Communication stinks!",1
"As my wife says, this is where you go if you are broke or don't want to pay 10 for a drink at Tea Station. The crowd is typically younger but the quality is the same as you'd get from Tea Station at almost half the price. I ordered a mixed fruit slush boba and it was too sweet. I told the waitress and they changed it out with no attitude or questions. That's definitely rare trust me!",2
"i dont think i've ever hated a hotel as much as i hate the westin cauarina las vegas hotel nthey upgraded me to a full suite on my last stay, complete with three sinks, three rooms, and a walk in closet nthey did everything a hotel could do to make it up to me nbut when you get robbed when you're staying in a hotel, you don't forgive easily",1
"It was the worst dinner I had we went with a group we had the worst service . The manager very impolite , agressive they don t have what in z menu and no excuses their answer we didn t do it today . Not flexible to accomadate clients . Well it was a good one before but since they sell it became very bad and prices very high . Never going again .",1
"This place is great! Our waitress was wonderful. Edamame Squid Salad was perfect. The Phoenix roll was incredible. Volcano roll. Not so much. I hated it. It was sooo mushy! It has some kind of spicy mayo in it. It seriously tasted like nothing but mayonnaise. The consistency was just mayo also. I definitely recommend this place, just watch out for the Volcano Roll.",2
"Finally have a boba place near my house! This place is really good, as long as you aren't looking for something crazy. It's hard to find places that use real fruits for boba, so I normally order their royal milk tea. Their snow fluff is good just make you verify what you order. Three times now they got my original snow fluff with strawberries on top mixed with strawberry snow fluff",2
I have going there for couple years and there is always new people and they are just slow. I don't have time to be sitting here for hours just for a pedicure. Plus I hate that they are close on Mondays and don't open until 10. This is a 24 hour town. Open at least at 9 am. Time to get to a new place,1
"This place is a classic, it used to be one of my regular places, good food, decent service, been around a long time, good vibe here. I sent in last month and they had new menus they at least DOUBLED the prices on the menu. 20.00 bucks for a taco plate, no thanks! one of the nice things about mexican food is that it is affordable. Not here! this place just lost my long term business.",1
"Heavy pour mix drinks and a darn good selection of beers. nService is usually sluggish, so bring a flask, your patience and a hot girl to get the bartenders attention, or you may NEVER get a drink. Music choices are hit or miss. nIt's a good atmosphere, with great features, but this draws large crowds, makes it hard to find a seat and the music is geared toward a ""certain "" crowd.",2
Blah! Blah! Blah! My hubby and I came here with such high expectations after reading hearing all the reviews. and boy were we ever disappointed. infact my hubby got kind of quesy after eating here and we returned to our hotel to sleep it off. nYet another buffet that I will not be coming to in Vegas,1
"I got a special Duck entree and it was the most delicious tasting mix of Duck, grapes, pineapple, and cherry tomatoes. The sauce was simply amazing. You can choose how spicy you want it. I went with a 4 and it was still spicy for me. I also tried the fried ice cream. Soooo. good. Very friendly staff and the owner was there when I was there and made sure I was satisfied with everything.",2
"I have been here twice, i am so glad an authentic mexican place is finally in this part of town. The lady at the front desk is always nice and helpful. I love their meat, especially their pork as it is very flavorful. They always give large helping of meat and guacamole in each taco so make sure you pick up napkins before you start eating!",2
"My husband and I went here for the first time today. Had one of the best pedicures I have ever had. Was extremely clean, light, and colorful. I will definitely try getting nails done here and see how they do. I have not been able to find a decent nail salon in the area yet. Will write a review after I have my nails done.",2
"Carne asada tacos were nasty. I had to spit out chunks of fat numerous times. Also, waitress was awful. Overcharged our table, rolled eyes at our table, and manager acted like he cared, but seemed in on the crappy waitresses bs. My friends and I will not return to this restaurant again due to overcharging us for crappy food and drinks, as well as the way they treated us.",1
"This place has really gone downhill since I last stayed here. The safe in the room did not work. They only provided three bath towels. The room looked dim and dingy. It does not feel clean at all. Will not stay here again. The resort fee is a joke. I thought we were going to have free Wi Fi, bathrobes, And a newspaper in the morning. Nope! You can't even pay for Wi Fi in the rooms.",1
A cute setting with a wait staff that's trying very hard. We got most dishes on the menu across our group of 5 and all of them were incredibly bland including the sangria and the house wine. Worst part we paid 45 a person for all of it! Such a ripoff! I feel bad because they're trying hard but I don't think they'll last.,1
"Met friends from out of town here to catch up and was NOT disappointed. Great coffee at comparable prices, and the fresh sandwiches and desserts were to die for. I had the lemon and sage Vegan cupcake. YUM. The staff is only average but heck its a coffee bar! I'll visit again, and if you like coffee shops, you should try this place out.",2
"Great Japanese cuisine conveniently located in the MGM Grand. Shibuya has a sleek ambiance, a friendly helpful staff and great tasting food. The various types of sushi rolls we ordered were fresh and delicious. You can't go wrong at Shibuya, I recommend this place for dinner if you want a divine night out.",2
"It's nice to not "" require "" appointments however, if you don't have one and it's a busy day it can be a bit if a wait. The location is convenient so you can do other shopping or go home and back. You could also call in and check in and they will let you know when to come back. Good prices and Steve Harrington is the BEST!",2
"I like the Mirage because its the only place i made money this weekend in Vegas. It wasnt like the movie where you hear ""YOUR DEAD GRISWALD! "" but i did get a lot of 6's. Anyhow, the staff is very friendly, and the Beatles love lounge is pretty cool. Ive never stayed here, only gambled, so ill update if i ever stay here.thats up to mgm marketing.",2
First visit here and they treatment me like a big tippin' regular! Brian was the technician assigned to perform my pedicure. My dogs were in bad shape ya'll. Brian really took his time and straighten these suckers out. And I liked that he didn't try to up sale. Brian is so personable! Ask for him! Loved the experience! Their prices are very affordable too! I will return for my next pedicure.,2
"Based on the reviews on Yelp, we tried this tonight as take out. The calamari salad was excellent and very different. We loved our vegetables with scallops. We will definitely be back. As good as it gets in the west valley and NOT a chain. Hard to find something that is not a chain out here but to find one that is good, is wonderful.",2
"Stick with the fruit smoothies and add whatever health shots you are needing. I've tried a few of the hot blends and am not a big fan. The spicy chai tastes gritty and the green matcha has some bitter harshness to it. Service is helpful, friendly, and quick. Wish they had more of a seating area rather than the to go setup.",2
"It's a cheap, nasty dive, only open weekdays for lunch, with only one thing worth ordering a gyro and fries. The gyros are made Pittsburgh fashion good pita bread, a huge pile of the standard lamb beef shavings, and topped with a very generous dose of tzatziki, lettuce, tomato and onion. The seasoned fries with it are perfect. All for around 7 with a drink.",2
"It was my last lunch before I left Arizona, this place reminds me of Cheesecake Factory the decor that is . I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad with the dressing on the side. It was really good due to the dressing, very different from a typical Asian salad elsewhere. I also had some of their enchiladas and it was exquisite, wow really good.",2
Tonight was my first dining experience at Grape Street. I was so impressed with the excellent service and food! There were 5 people in our party and everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! Our server was top notch and very helpful in ordering.from our wine to our entrees. I can't wait to go back. I think I have a new favorite restaurant!,2
"service is very very poor! we waited 25mins for dimsum, i asked for shrimp and pork dimsum lady said "" i only have chicken feet.,wtf y dont u get more! commonsense . we ended up getting fried noodles. forget about this place i highly recommend C FU restaurant in chandler, this place suck! more than 50 people inside and they ony have one dimsum cart running.",1
"There was an immediate welcoming spirit when we entered! Observed the staff to be extremely attentive. I went from left to right on the plate, so I could get to the risotto first, then the baby asparagus nestled beside a delicious Flat Iron steak. Leave your knife on the table. Easy parking and a great location also convince us of many returns to Taste of Dahntahn! SALUTE",2
"We were greeted at the door so that was nice. I waited patiently to have an associate get a shirt off the top rack and was ignored. Then, my friend goes to pay and they ran out of change. I have never been to a Hot Topic in my life and even with super cute The Breakfast Club items, I would not return.",1
"We love bass pro! It's fun just to walk around and look at everything. I do wish they could keep ammo stocked but no sporting store seems to be able to do so. I won't hold that against them. I also wish they allowed dogs. My dog loves to go to home depot, Lowe's and cabellas and I'm sure he would like to visit bass pro!",2
"I always enjoy a good sandwich, so my wife and I checked this place out for dinner. We ordered the fish sandwich, crusty crab and sweet potato fries. The presentation of the food was great and everything tasted really good too. Their whole thing is to serve gourmet burgers and sandwiches with a Asian twist. All and all, it worth a visit.",2
"Place was great. They allowed pets and prices were good. They are close enough to the strip but far enough away to enjoy other parts of Vegas away from the tourists. The breakfast was pretty good eggs, sausage, biscuits gravy, waffles, yogurt, cereals.etc. and had a nice courtyard and indoor poor. Rooms were clean and tidy.",2
I came in for a full set Friday! 4 days later and my nails have been lifting. I called today because I've been unable to go over the weekend and luckily Vanessa said to come in today and they would take care of it. And that is exactly what they did they made them absolutely gorgeous and I am even more happier than I've ever been with any set thank you Cosmo!,2
"We travel all over the country and hit a Starbucks for our morning shot of Joe. The worst service of any Starbucks I've ever been in is a mile from our new home. Lucky me. I asked to speak to the manager but she doesn't come in until the afternoon. So, in the morning when the place is busiest the manager doesn't work. It shows in their level of service. Drive to another location, it's worth it.",1
"There are definitely better Italian restaurants on the strip with cheaper prices. Also, service on a good day is just OK. So that should tell you something. I would advise that you to try somewhere else. Don't waste your time. Especially since I can't remember how the food tasted. Yeah, this is one of those places.",1
The buffet is amazing and the people are so nice! Don't let one person's opinion of vomit throw you off. It's just plain rude and distasteful. My friends and I have been coming here for years and love it! I finally have some week days off and get to come back. Now I don't have to take a sick day to come eat at their buffet. ,2
"I told my mom the buffet at Wynn was supposed to be fabulous based on Yelp reviews but she didn't want to wait in the line so we headed to the Terrace Pointe Cafe. The menu is small but lovely, the food is presented in an artful fashion my mother loved the caramelized sugar on her lime half , and the food was great. I would certainly eat here again.",2
"My boyfriend and have eaten here many times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed. The quality of the food is D lish, tasty perfect size servings. The breakfast is the best Eggs Benedict is my favorite. We have brought our families also to enjoy this place. Highly recommended. Only con the service is a little slow but the servers are friendly",2
"My favorite restaurant during our trip to Montreal over Thanksgiving. We went for brunch and highly recommend others do the same. It's got a great, neighborhood y vibe and was the only restaurant we visited that had a line albeit one that moved fairly quickly . You can tell that this is a place that locals love!",2
My boyfriend has taken me to this place twice and I absolutely love it. The service is always top notch. We have had the same waiter both times and it was nice he remembered us. The appetizers and the main dish are always on point. I always get the filet mignon and I love it. We love going here and will continue to go.,2
"The staff is not friendly at all. When u ask them to toast the sub or to add toppings, u can see from there faces that they are burdened. I understand that I go early when they open, but that doesn't give them the right to act like the way they do. The don't really say hi at all, instead I end up saying how Ur doing. If I had a choice to not to go to this branch, I would totally avoide this one.",1
Don't know what it is but I've always used Supercuts. Here in Las Vegas I just got to whatever location I happen to be near when there urge to get a haircut strikes. This place was great. No wait. No line. Quick in out in under 15 minutes. Very friendly ladies and an affordable haircut 13.95 tip. I will be back in 2 weeks.,2
"Went there on a night where there were live bands. Definatley a fan, the crowd and the band gets into everything. There is also a nother section you can go to if you arent in to the band. It has a pool table and vidoe games. The bartenders are pretty hott and are good at paying attention to all of the customers and not getting swamped. Definatley going to come back here!",2
"I guess Im lucky? We live near NNY so we eat there a few times a month. First off they now have sweet tea, thank you. The pizza is above average and they will bring you several different wing sauces if you ask. Josh was our waiter last time and he was amazing. I will be asking for him when I return. Can't complain, it's been good.",2
"One stop shop. Not only is Sprouts the only grocery store I can go to to find everything I need, the prices are great too. No joke. Despite the customer incentives and members cards available at other stores, I still end up saving more at Sprouts. They have a great deli selection too. Try the seafood salad. Delicious!",2
"okay not going to lie, i LOVE s bar! yes its cramped but the crowd is just out to have a good time. The dance floor is in the back and the music is always good. we just always have fun dancing here because it doesnt seem like anyone really cares. I cant really compare the atmosphere to anything, just like.typical.",2
"The guy that put on a full set went entirely too fast. He was finished in about 20 minutes and, guess what, they began lifting within days and two completely popped off. Plus, I went in about 15 mintues after they opened and they had to ask me to sign in and come back 15 minutes later because their employee was running late. Bad service and bad workmanship. I won't be back.",1
"My abject disdain for Trader Joes continues and if not for the wife , I would not have stopped. This place is a lie. It portends to be healthy and organic, but the shelves are lined with processed sugar pulp. Cookies, marshmallows and the occasional guilt assuaging yuk seaweed crisps. Trader Joes, I'd ask you to shut your pie hole, but it's too full of, well, pies.",1
1OAK Nightclub is a fun place to party at! We danced to Hip Hop Top 40 All night long! We had a mixed group of guys girls.had no problem getting in. We were treated to a Special guest performance by NeYo! Even Popped some bottles with some celebrities! Overall we had a great experience at this nightclub in the Mirage hotel casino! We will be back soon!,2
"Bland, Americanized Italian fare, with poor service, and over the top campy decor. I realize it's part of the schtick or ""charm "" if you insist, but it's still a bit much, and serves to only slightly deflect attention away from the mediocre food. If you are not a party of 12 or more, don't expect a lot of attention.",1
"Great suite. Great service. Loved the Valet crew. Across from Fashion show shopping mall. Fresh flowers everywhere and the hotel smells great at every turn. nGreat for kids because no casino, no smoking and low occupancy rate. What's up with the single 24 in TV at the bar? What are you thinking Donald?",2
I don't know shiiiet about cars. nBut these guys DO! And they are niiiice and sooo friendly and knowledgeable! nFinding an honest mechanic is difficult especially for me being a female not knowing shiet! nThese guys are fantastic tho. No need to worry about getting ripped off or sold shit you don't need. nLet them take care of all your car maintenance needs!,2
"This is my second time to this location, and my trillionth time to Quiznos! Just like always it taste amazing! I love their sandwiches and it puts subway under the table. At this location the staff is nice, and can take multiple orders at once and not mess up! They make the line move fast! This time I got the traditional on jalape u00f1o cheddar bread and it was delicious and I highly recommend!",2
"Some of the worst customer service you will ever receive. Do not go here unless it is an absolute emergency, and even then try to find someplace else. The worst, the worst, THE WORST! There is ONE employee who is actually helpful, an older gentleman, no one else will feel compelled to help you at all. DO NOT SHOP HERE!",1
"Picked this dentist because they had Saturday apptointments. Made an appt for 2 1 2 mos away, because they only were open 1 Sat a month, the Friday before my appt I get a call to cancel my appt, the dentist couldnt work this Sat! Why offer Saturday visits, if the dentist wont work on Sat?!? I figure if he is making enough money working mon fri he doesnt need my business!",1
"Very similar to the food offered at Chipotle, so if you like Chipotle, you may like this chain, too. I tried the shredded beef bowl without any queso sauces and it was good. I left pleasantly satisfied. Staff were friendly and a HUGE plus for me here, although probably not for everybody, is that it is a smoke free environment, too.hip hip hooray!",2
"Nothing really good to report here, very low quality food, low quality service and not a very good value. All of the food is highly salted and tasteless. For what it is, there are a ton of better options on the strip and off the strip, check out Caesar's Buffet, Wynn's Buffet or Bellagio's Buffet, but please don't waste your time here, place is quite below average.",1
"I want these rooms for my next home. The black lining on the edges is something I saw a while back in Domino magazine. I spent most of my time gambling here, i felt it was the most spacious and therefore enjoyable. I dont like crowded smoke places. nWe had dinner at Sinatra and that place needs work.",2
"Been waiting for 1.5 hours for a wash and shampoo. I was told it would be done in 2 hours, and they haven't even started! Service is horrible. I have enjoyed using the groupons, but this will be my last experience at this car wash. Too many other options. I have given this place so many chances. nMy car had better look good after this fiasco.",1
This place should be called I Hate Burgers. Our party ordered a total of 6 different burgers. Every single person complained about how dry and terrible the burger was. I had the salmon burger. It was terrible. The patty tasted like a frozen fishy mushy mess. All of our buns were dry and crumbly. Even the french fries were terrible. I would never return.,1
"This boutique is located on Central Avenue at Hawthorne. It has some unusual items, but nothing out of the ordinary. I found it to be highly overpriced and scattered. Among the items carried are jewelry, candles, wall decor, vintage furniture and bath products. Not a bad selection, but I'd probably search elsewhere first for what I need before checking here.",1
"We made a special trek out here for Montreal's supposed best brew pup, only to be told childreot allowed. Maybe it's a cultural difference, since in my hometown Philly the slow, 5 6pm hours are when urban parents like me bring our well managed kids with us to brewpubs to enjoy a pint and a meal with friends. It's pretty shocking to be told you aren't welcome in an establishment.",1
"Food was decent , but the wait staff was extremely unprofessional as well as slow. Which is weird considering there was only 4 customers total in the restaurant and nearly 12 wait staff. It took nearly 20 minutes to receive our drinks should have been a warning sign . We will probably never return. This Tony Romas was nothing like the California ones im used to.",1
"Wonderfully cheap happy hour and lunch specials. We're talking four dollars for a half pound burger and drink. The full price appetizer menu was tasty, but a little expensive for the amount of food. I definitely recommend Skip and Jan's if you're looking to watch a weekend sporting event and want to enjoy some inexpensive food. The service is 5 stars.",2
"I really like this joint. The beer and whiskey selection is extensive, the best part is that it runs from cheap to expensive so you can drink what you can afford depending on the night. The place has a good dive feel, dark but not terribly seedy. Usually a few interesting characters hanging about, definitely a different feel from a lot of the other bars in the immediate vicinity but in a good way.",2
"The ORIGINAL pool party in Vegas and by far the BEST! If you're looking for an insane day party in Vegas look no further than Rehab at the Hard Rock. It's like a ""Big Kid Spring Break "" jammed packed into Vegas. Don't come here if you're on a budget as the entry fee and drinks are very expensive but do come here if you don't care about price and are simply looking to party. Rehab Rage Fest",2
Alright well im going to have to say that my wife and i always try to get some good bbq from this place and when it was open it was amazing but they have been on vacation for about 3 months and its very upsetting to try to go get some bbq and they always have on their door that there still on vacation.awful.wish they were dependable.,1
"This is a very authentic Chinese restaurant. I am not rating it on its pnash it has none. This is a restaurant and food as you would find it in China. I love the food and have had many of the dishes. This stuff is great. Be warned, there are people that have difficulty getting over some of the textures, decor and presentation, but I love this stuff. Amazing and exotic.",2
"Four stars ONLY due to lack of convenience. Must schedule trips around ""rush hour "" to prevent searching for a parking spot and waiting in long lines. The place is crowded for a reason. Must have items include chocolate chip cookie sprinkled with sea salt, the dressing on the caesar salad and the coffee served for breakfast. Service is great.staff always very friendly and accommodating.",2
"What to say about this place? Great food, great service and the location is great if you like to hike North Mountain a lot I'm no expert with Tortas but this place has some amazing ones which will fill you up with lunch and dinner! Being a long time fan of Travel Channel's ""Man vs Food "" I've been meaning to try this place for some time now. Glad I did. Sure you will too.",2
"Will not go back! I stopped at this place bc there was a large sign outside saying that a pedi was 20. Well, come to find out after my pedi that's only if you also get a full set so I had to pay 25 for the pedi. About 1 2 way thru my pedi, the tech gets up to wax someone's eyebrows! The experience was not worth my time.",1
"A COCKROACH fell from the ceiling onto my plate as my companion and I sat there chatting after our meal! I'm a regular diner here having lived in Vegas for over 2yrs. Usually I get the Bun Bo Hue one of the best place in town for it or the generous portions of Tai Nam. No matter how good the food taste, I am NEVER going back. Definitely will call and notify the city's health department tomorrow.",1
This place is always fresh and delicious. I usually get the ginger chicken bowl or the chicken teriyaki bowl. I've also had the yakisoba noodles which are also good. I try not to eat the crab puffs but they are just too hard to pass up! The man and woman who work the drive thru are always VERY nice!,2
"The best I've had in Vegas! Everything was amazing, we had the tasting menu which for the value was one of the best in Vegas! The flower and Tabasco cocktail was awesome and then thank god the server guided us away from more cocktails and towards the amazing wine pairings! It was from start to finish one of the best meals I've ever had",2
"The wings were delicious! They were moist! the Parmesan wings were tasty but if you like spicy wings do not order these. They are not spicy at all. They do have ghost pepper flavor wings for brave eaters. The burgers rank 10 out of 10 for flavor , texture , and size. The waitresses are cute. This place is waaaay better than hooters.",2
"Know in advance that this is more a Mexican Spanish fusion tapas restaurant. Food Quality is good but prices may be high. Go for value dishes, otherwise price mounts quickly. Baja Fish Tacos and the Bacon wrapped Dates were excellent. Service Staff was attentive and the Chef greeted us which was a nice touch. Atmosphere Quiet, restaurant may be more lively for dinners though.",2
"This establishment looks very appealing. Ambience is nice, but their business would probably benefit by putting the correct closing weekday hours on their website. My boyfriend and I drove all the way from mountains edge to catch their late happy hour 12 3a but unfortunately we arrived to find out that last call is at 145am, not 3.",1
"This has become our Saturday morning, post Weight Watchers meeting, breakfast hangout. Love the Nurse's breakfast, my fianc u00e9e typically gets the breakfast tacos. Good service, front patio is nice, the side patio is too cramped for my taste. Parking can be tight during peak hours so carpool if possible.",2
"If u want try some delicious Chinese food, try this place, I'm pretty sure everyone knows about PF CHANG's. Love the spot, great service, great food, not too expensive but the atmosphere is pretty chill. Music choice can be better. But overall it's a great place to have meetings, Dates or just to grab some quick lunch on Ur lunch break.",2
"Best sandwich I've ever had was thier Wild turkey sandwich, the delicious bread really brings out the yumminess of the turkey, and exceptional service in the bar from an amazing waitress named Alicia, she is so sweet and courteous. Great place to grab a quick bite to eat if heading up north or headed south to phx ",2
"This is a good place to watch some NFL on Sunday. The food is creative and never disappointing. You have to try the Wisconsin Cheese Curds if it's your first time. The beer list is a lot of Stone Brewery and analogs. I usually get the Woodchuck Cider draft. I can't believe how much better Cider Ale taste on tap compared to the bottle, night and day.",2
If you want scabies stay at this hotel.wear your sandals in shower and carpet but cheap and right in the middle of everything.this place is constantly under construction but you know what for 40 bucks tonight if you want to be in the heart of Vegas and never really be in your room go there but know that when you leave you're probably going to leave with scabies!,1
I needed them to send my RX from a previous eye exam and they made us wait hours and submit 4 faxes before 1 of them was acceptable. I will never go to them again. They are also way over priced. So I would check other prices in the area. Vision works has great glasses at a great price AND the people that work there are helpful kind. They are at the waterfront in Homestead.,1
"If I could give this place 0 stars I would, that is how bad the food was. It seemed like they had only cooked 10 dishes and sadly the most memorable dish was the frozen corn. I didn't think it was humanly possible, but I have finally found a buffet worse than Hometown Buffet. Good job Circus Circus.",1
Service is clearly a priority here. Carl and Lifan are incredibly knowledgeable and pleasurable to work with. I dropped off my wheels to be trued and the work was performed as promised and in a timely manner. Their rates are competitive and very fair. Irwin Cycles has definitely earned a return customer.,2
I was craving Cuban food when I flew into Vegas. I found this place online and decided to try it after reading reviews. It was Monday around 8 30 pm and they were closed despite lisiting online they were open until 10 pm. I drove across town for nothing and leave town tomorrow. They should really update their listings online.,1
This small deli with a few seats to sit in with your coffee salad roll is always clean and well presented. The fillings for your choice of roll etc are extensive and nothing is too much bother for the friendly staff. The quality of the coffee is high and many local business people call in for their takeaway breakfast or lunch.,2
"I needed a quick bite and stopped here. I had the chicken Blue Burrito, their specialty. It was shredded chicken, black beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce and tomato in a flour tortilla. It was okay. It was actually very bland yet it was filling. The beer I washed it down with was actually better than the burrito. It's okay in a pinch but there are better places around.",1
"Good christ this show was nothing short of amazing terrifying at times horrifying un be lieve able! I talked for an hour trying to recount everything about this show to someone who didn't see it before I realized it just isn't necessary to say anything more than ""Go see it "". P.S. If you are easily offended, this is not the show for you.",2
"Being Hispanic and having grown up eating authentic dishes, I can usually tell what's good Latin food and what's not. Havana Cafe doesn't even come close. I can make better food at home. Their pasteles were bland, as was their rice and their beans. The mojito was pretty good, but not worth being disappointed over the food. Wouldn't go back.",1
We decided to try Sensi on a recommendation because we were looking for somewhere romantic and trendy. The service was excellent! The food was superb! It was cool watching the kitchen work since it is located in the center of the restaurant and is all glass. I could definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone traveling to Las Vegas!,2
"Locally owned, in my neighborhood, straight razors and ""old skool "" shaving cream. This place is a true oasis! I went in and had my beard trimmed and neck shaved while watching Star Trek and sipping a soda doesn't get much better than that, right? . The service was hands down 5 star! I felt like i was invited into the owners home as a guest. Going to make this part of my monthly ritual.",2
"If you want great Indian food then this is the place for you! This is by far the BEST Indian food in Scottsdale Phoenix. n It was so much fun to try different dishes and have everyone taste GREAT. Yes, everyone was delicious. n I couldn't pick a favorite because they were are ALL fantastic. When we left the restaurant we were already planning our next trip back.",2
"Scale of 1 10 single visit n10 Food n10 Service n10 Atmosphere n6 Value Went during restaurant week where they offered a surprisingly reasonably priced set menu. They also let me tinker with it a bit without jumping to a la carte prices. The mac cheese was super awesome, and the desserts were greatness. In the end, I think I messed myself a little.",2
Terrible food. I ordered the volcano shrimp which advertises that they serve it flaming. No flaming tasted like shrimp with onion relish over it. I asked them why this is they laughed made some excuse but never offered to replace the dish. The ambiance is a 5 but don't be fooled. The food is what matters.,1
"This place is shitballs. They had no baskets so we had to carry our food around the store. We stood in the customer service line forever because it had the liquor, when we asked a store employee Keyanna could she please grab the Hennessy for us, because she was literally 2ft away she said ask the lady at the register. This Walmart sucks",1
"I really do enjoy coming here on a sunny afternoon to drink their 2 beer specials and sit outside with friends under the trees. The staff is really friendly and you can also bring your pups to hang out with you. Oh and they have ping pong and corn hole to play to. I have not had their food that is a must for next time, so my four stars are for beer prices and atmosphere really casual.",2
"My fiance and I like to go to Casbah for special occasions and each time it never disappoints. The food is great I highly recommend the Pork Chop and the Short Rib Ravioli , the drinks are wonderful I am a sucker for good Sangria and Casbah's is wonderufl and the service is outstanding our servers are always friendly, prompt and very knowledgeable .",2
My girlfriend and I went to Flancer's for dinner out the other night and had a great experience. The food was fresh and tasted great. We had a pizza and brochette. I have been to the Gilbert location for lunch before and the sandwiches were awesome. Good food and friendly staff. We will be going back in the future.,2
A friend and I went on a groupon. We were excited to try the DIPPING bar. The tables that we were seated at were more like lounge seats. I didn't see where the dipping came into play because there wasn't any. The price was a little high and the buns on the burger fell apart fast. I wouldnt go back unless they brought in small snacks and DIP ABLE food. I dont expect this place to last too long.,1
"Stayed here for a fun long weekend of golf, baseball, and Final Four March Madness. We over spent, the location is good, the staff was very good to us, but they were not worth over 200 a night. They have a VERY small ugly pool behind the place.it has one table and a couple of chairs.that's pretty weak in my opinion. Rooms are good, microwave, fridge, sink for bar, pretty good set up for us. nYMMV",2
I love Nikkos! Been going here since it was in the small venue across the parking lot! This place by FAR has the best sushi! The chefs are amazing and the owner Joanna is always there ready to keep the energy lively. If you want cheap smelly raw fish then please go elsewhere. You get what you pay for here! SUSHI LOVE!,2
"Thai Basil used to be my favorite local restaurant until they changed from ""Thai Pan "" to Thai Basil, a local chain . After several months under the new ownership the food was excellent but then they began to cheapen and ""bland "" their food. My last two dinners there were terrible. Regretfully I've taken them off my togo and eat in list.",1
"The bartender was slurring her words and clearly wasted. She had a hard time taking our order and carrying out simple requests like requesting a channel or water and we were the only 2 people in there. The cook actually ended up having to remind her. She was sweet tho, just drunk. Not much of a selection of beer but the food was good. Won't be coming back.",1
the sliding glass windows they installed in my new custom home were of very poor quality. when we expressed our dissatisfaction they said the waves in our glass were normal for tempered glass. The windows in their showroom that we looked at were not wavy. Our glass looks almost like the glass from a funhouse!,1
These ppl don't even deserve a star.first off I was ignored walking in I literally had to call them on the phone to get their attention and get some help.2nd Idk if one of the cashiers was touching the food I hope she wasn't she was wearing gloves n scratching her head with them n touching money with them.eeww.n to top it off I found a hair baked into my pizza.these ppl are rude n disgusting!,1
This place is very laid back. When we walked up we were greeted by a very friendly waiter whom have us menus an that we could sit anywhere than come up an order when ready. The food is really good it's bar dinner type food sliders side dishes pie milkshakes. The pie in a jar is fantastic There is a boxing gym inside sometimes the music felt it was being turned up a little loud ,2
"As suggested, we tried the Cal Italia. It truly was worth all the recommendations. Absolutely loved the pizza and the appetizer meatballs were the perfect compliment. Cool atmosphere, great location downtown, accommodating service and food very much worth coming back for. Which we will be doing soon!",2
Ate here with my parents. It's now 18.40 to eat the ever shrinking all you can eat menu. The service is slow and not attentive. The quality of the sushi is passable. I am now officially over this resto chain. I understand that this place will last because of all the offices along Decarie captive audience. Their others probably will die because the quality to price ratio has gone way down.,1
Went there with a Groupon and was pleasantly surprised. Food was really good. Service was good. We had the Pork roast sliders and fish tacos very yummy. I could smell the smoke coming from the lounge but my husband couldn't. This place is one of the better bar and grill type of places in Scottsdale because of the food.,2
This location sucked. The ice was melting and the middle didn't have any syrup in it and was just ice. Went back to have them fix it to which the girl replied they couldn't do anything about the ice. I told her to give me a new one which turned out to be the same. On top of it they used a broken cup to teach me a lesson I guess. 4 for a crap product. Will not be returning.,1
"Put you on hold forever case in point the entire time it took to write this review . Do not have products as advertised in the weekly flyers produce and bakery . Products are generally higher end expensive. Even as a foodie, it is generally not worth my time. I prefer whole paycheck for my advanced culinary needs.",1
"A friendly environment that has some wild combinations that I would have never thought of, but surprisingly tickle my taste buds that have me coming back for more! They have great drink specials as well as entree specials that make this place a wonderful place to eat and enjoy your time with friends or family",2
The burger was pretty good the service was disappointing. Our waitress looked like a vegas dancer but had the attitude of a grumpy old bar maid. Tables are packed like sardines and the R R music is great but a little too loud.the burger was tasty.the iced tea was cold The fries were meh.not very fresh nothing to write home about.,1
"Great little corner spot. I love the Caprese sandwich and their signature chips. But it's too much for me to eat alone. I've been here several times and found that it's best to split a sandwich. When you order, tell them you are sharing it and they will put it on separate plates for you. Always nice, friendly service!",2
"Beautiful new steakhouse in Scottsdale! The decor was really well done and it was interesting that they had a pool area upstairs.I am imagining that could be quite a scene on the weekends. The service was helpful and attentive. The food was quite good, but pricey and very large portions. A friend and I shared a salad, the halibut and two sides asparagus corn . Everything was delicious though!",2
"If i could give this place a 0, I would! Long story short, money was stolen from our room and the hotel claims they can't do anything about it. So what's the point of staying at a high end place when they can't even protect their rooms?!?! Shadyness under all the fancy crystals in the building.and i've read and heard this happens often. I'll stick to Wynn, thank you.",1
"Mellow mushroom pizza is now one of my favorites. The crust is the best I have ever had and the toppings were fresh. I have been their 2 times now and the serving staff wasn't exactly the most friendly or helpful. I would rate the service as a 2 3 and the pizza as a 5. nThe pizza will keep me coming back, but the service might have me chose takeout.",2
"This place gets a two because it is insanely overpriced, and the portions are small. The food tastes fine, but not great. Cabo Wabo has a nice patio on the Vegas strip, but I could eat better somewhere else for the same price or cheaper. I will say, they do have decent margaritas. Oh and avoid the nacho appetizer. It's literally one dozeachos for WAYYYY too much.",1
"My friend KP loves this restaurant. .he's the guy who can clap 12 times in one second. Very impressive. Anyway, he knows a thing or two about Mongolian Grill, and I have to agree with him on this one. What's not to like about YC's? Who would hate on this place? Affordable, tastey, comfortable, fast. That KP clearly know what he's talking about.",2
"Very cool, small place. We came here at the end of the night so it was dead. Good selection of spirits and beers. The bartender was very nice as well. This place is now on my husbands very short list of ""Scottsdale bars that dont feel like Scottsdale bars therefore he'll go out in Scottsdale w me if we go there "" bars. I'd go here again.",2
Probably the worst nights sleep I have had. The room was nice and clean. A little pricy for a HIX but worst of all was the noise from water pipes or something all night long. On and off like the tank on the toilet bowl refilling. Ours did it and above or below was doing it as well. I usually have better results and never have to worry. Unfortunately this stay wasn't as pleasurable.,1
"Just took our son with a big group of friends and family to celebrate his 21st birthday on our visit to Vegas. Been here many times.not it's not 5 start dining, but the food is good, portions are big, the place is fun for a group, and service is good.gotta see hear Gordie and his accordian. Just go, drink the 'free' wine and have a blast.",2
"I went to this salon using a Living Social coupon for a haircut, treatment, and style and was thoroughly happy with everything. Trisha was my stylist, and she asked me several questions before cutting my hair and during the haircut and styling. I received several compliments on my cut and style. I will definitely be going back. The salon is trendy, and the staff is very friendly.",2
Took my lady friend here and was blown away with how good the food tasted. Ingredients for our hot pot dishes were fresh and portions were huge. We got the chicken wings and stinky tofu for our appetizers.so authentic. Service staff were nice and friendly. Definitely coming back for 1 more stop before leaving town.,2
My kids and husband love the swimming pool. It was uniquely build around this massive salt water aquarium with sharks and lots of big fish. There was even a water slide that goes thru the the fish tank. my 7 year old daughter loved it. We would definitely go there again for the pool. PLus for a weekday rate of 49 day it was a great bargain.,2
"Appreciated the convenience of the Mitre nearest the castle. When I think of a Scottish restaurant, The Mitre is what I expected historic feeling, accented dark wood furnishings, high ceilings, fireplace, great beers on tap and great Scottish food. The service was on spot and really enjoyed the haggis, fish and chips complimented with a nice Scottish ale.",2
"If you like your burger in a loud trendy joint, then you will love the atmosphere. The burger itself is awesome. Get the delux burger, the one with maytag and gruyere cheese served on a demi baguette. You wont be hungry after that. If you are pile on some sweet potato fries and a couple of craft brews and you are done!",2
"On the surface I was expecting just expensive sushi but Baku brought is so much more. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Creative and flavorful menu. As soon as my wallet recovers, which I don't begrudge them I will be back in a heartbeat. Expensive is fine if they can deliver and Baku did in every way.",2
"One word, phenomenal. Not only is the food delicious, the service is as well. Worth every penny. I had the tiger shrimp corn garlic tamale the sauce really pulled this together. I wanted to ring out the corn husk it was served in to get every last bit of it. My entree was a cornmeal crusted chile relleno. Great presentation and an even better taste. All I can say here is make reservations.",2
Never shopping here again. We ordered a large combo and two slices of pepperoni. They had the pizzas ready but instead sold our slices to other individuals. We waited 30 mins then just told them were cancelling the order. They were extremely incompetent or racist. I will be canceling my membership here.,1
First time here was pretty hesitant from reading the reviews but my stay was perfect we stayed on the 26th floor room and restroom was spacious modern and clean overall stay was nice ordered room service took 30 min housekeepers were attentive and punctual everyone was super nice. To top it off it has a awesome location ! nOnly let down was the pool nothing impressive compared to other ones,2
"Lots of mixed reviews, decided to try it anyway.the service was great, the brisket was tender and the sauce was very decent BUT the sides were awful! rolls were rock hard n potato salad was from a carto cornbread was old and flavorless n sweet tea bland! n corn was cooked within an inch of its life First and last visit!",1
Standard but special. Enjoyed the stuffed chicken and the gazpacho. Coffee washed it all dowicely. It strives to be French and it certainly achieves such by the decor and view of Vieux Montr u00e9al outside the windows. Staff was accommodating and tolerant of my family's absence of fran u00e7ais. To go au jour is the best bet for this joint.,2
"Good food. Not earth shattering but just good food. The Calamari appetizer was unspectacular. The lasagna was the best lasagna my daughter said she has ever had. She is not Garfield or any lasagna expert but still, that is a good sign. My son's pasta was good, my son thought it was a bit under seasoned. The service was excellent.",2
"Cons Price garlic bread is 6 dollars , small portions, poor service. We had a 9 30pm reservation for dinner group of 4 we didn't get seated until well after 10pm with no apologizes. Pros Good food, nice place. Overall the food is good but not really worth the poor service, high prices, and long wait times, especially when there are so many other great restaurants around.",1
"We have had good and bad service here, and my wife is completely put off by the location and the ambience. The parking is atrocious. There are no reservations, and if you're waiting for a table get ready to be pushed hard to order from the bar. All that being said, it still gets 4 stars instead of 2, because the guacamole and the regular menu items are that good. Of course they are 50 overpriced.",2
"This was my first time at Viet Kitchen. I ordered a steak rice dish. Pretty disappointing. One scoop of rice, 7 pieces of chopped beef and 5 fries. Seriously? Seriously? the steak was dry. the food was not even close to filling. and why the heck was there only 5 fries? Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?",1
"The dirtiest hotel ever! Do not stay here. Went here and got a pet hotel room and right when my boyfriend and I walked into the room, the room smelled like dog urine. The smell was so horrible I did not even want to stay in the room for another minute. Luckily I was able to switch rooms but still felt grossed out. Will not stay here again! ",1
"I was promised a free comp from a host. Shane He never made the reservation. Long story short, the host on duty tried to charge me 199 per room, 2 Rooms when the online rate was 79.99 and I was supposed to receive a comp. If your a player, stay away from this casino. Shane's boss wasn't much better. Jose He did little to correct the issue. These guys are a bunch of clowns.",1
"I went there once. The food was overpriced, underdelicious, and what I mostly remember was that it took FOREVER. It was brunch time on a Saturday morning, but even taking that into consideration, there's no reason it should have taken 15 minutes for me to get my coffee. If I remember correctly, my companion didn't even get her drink until asking the waitress several times.",1
" 350! This place is delicious. I'm a huge mexican food snob and I lived in mexico for a about a year, so I know everything about mexican food. EVERYTHING! You have to try this place out at least once while you are in Las Vegas, if you don't you'll regret it for the rest of your mediocre life. Don't have a mediocre life eat at El Gordo damn it! Tell them Aar u00f3n sent you",2
"Excellent individualistic chef owned, gratifying food, and uniquely designed. Note The best of plaza chic if new to Phoenix you know that it takes awhile to grasp the gems in plazas. I don't claim nor will I ever claim to be a competent food critic. However I am confident you won't regret, if a quick check of the menu intrigues you, a moment of the experience.",2
"Firstly, the place drips of class. The interior is lovely, and sets a perfect mood for an outing in Montreal. The waiters at Le Montrealais are amazing. They are kind, friendly, and extremely efficient. I thought the food was also pretty good. It wasn't out of this world, but than again, I went there at brunch. Overall, I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant.",2
"This place. Guys.this place. Nachos. Beer. Suns beating the Kings currently and of course, the two and only, Grifstina power couple behind the bar. You can't beat it. We got the Thai chickeachos and you really have to.Thai.these! Get it?! Seriously though, it's a great spot with great food, great beer and atmosphere to match. Wander off Fremont and stop in.",2
"HORRIBLE! There is almost NO CELL SERVICE in the entire main floor! How can that happen?!? All 4 people in my party had NO CELL SERVICE AT ALL throughout every restaurant, clubs, bars, bathrooms gaming floor. RIDICULOUS! Also, prices are stupid high design is ugly unfinished warehouse ceiling in a Vegas Strip casino.?!?",1
Wish there was a 0 star that I could give it. Service was bad. Eff this place. Never returning. Went to the Body.whatever nightclub and it was bad too. Bartenders are bad everywhere. Bad attitudes everywhere. No real good reason to go here. It's off the strip so don't waste your time making a trip to it.,1
"Comme Ca, a French brasserie with a stunning terrace view of the half scale Eiffel Tower, offers a 17.50, three course lunch special featuring delights such as steamed mussels and pot de creme. The best part lunch runs late. Grab a table at 4 15 p.m. lunch close at 5 p.m. and linger through the evening.",2
The breakfast pastries are purchased elsewhere and reheated in a microwave right in front of you or toasted in a small toaster. 6.50 for a dry old cinnamon roll and a bagel that was only toasted on the half that fit in the tiny toaster it took 8 min to get it . This place is only in business because of the resort. If it had to stand on its own it would have been gone years ago.,1
"This place is an authentic Chinese restaurant. They have a great dim sum menu and have good service. The dim sum servers are a little pushy but other than that, this place is a must. Dim sum is served all day, unlike other places, so this place is already on top of my list for Chinese food cravings.",2
"The service was wonderful and the server was very nice, nbut . nDON'T GET THE PAD THAI. Its NOT pad thai. The young coconut. it was served whole with a spoon. nThe coconut meat was to tough to scrape out with the spoon. nBut the coconut water was refreshing. I think I'll stick to Touch of Thai iorth phoenix",1
"I really was expecting this place to be great. They really fall short of the ""Ramen "" part. nThe noodles tasted like pasta and the soup was more italian. nIf you love traditional Ramen, your better off waiting in line at Monta. nOh and if you get the seafood ramen here, its just an added powder, no actual seafood is used. nThey are too pricey for what you get.",1
"Went there to go grab the jacks munchies meal one late night, ordered the drive thru. When i got home i was disappointed. Soda was just carbonated water. Suppose to be raspberry iced tea, the deal i got was combination curly fries and reg. fries. I only got One. Yes 1 curly fry. Just horrible and what a waste of money.",1
" Disclaimer Haven't been in this store, just had a cupcake. Last summer when Missy F. was staying with my Dude and I for a while, she popped into Mind Over Batter and brought us both a cupcake as her way of saying, ""THANKS, Y'ALL! "" What a delicious cupcake! Extra moist lawl, moist cake and just the right amount of coconut. I would totally stop in and pay 3 to have one of these babies again!",2
"The service and setup for this place was awesome. Which was why I was terribly disappointed when the food came to the table. I ordered the heuvos rancheros and it was so incredibly bland. My eggs were dry and overcooked, my husband's sausage was rubber, and the coffee was literally the worst I've ever had. Not worth the price.",1
"I call this place and ask if they have pupusas and the girl, gretchen was her name I believe If I heard correctly hangs up on me! I call back and she doesn't pick up! I call private and ask why she hung up on me and she hangs up on me again! Super rude place! I'll be contacting the manager in the morning about this!",1
"Cool Americana, country, rustic, candles, furniture, and paint to name a few, but our favorite was their beautiful Collie that roams the store while you shop. Also very delicious complimentary cookies, and refreshing iced tea. On another note, the prices were way too high, and the staff at the registers weren't very friendly, almost rude. We probably won't be back anytime soon.",1
"While walking through PH, I decided to try Pink's. Let me just say, YUMMY! I had the western burger and I think I bite my finger on accident, because I was eating it si fast! LOL. It was so good and so reasonably priced. It was cooked to order and all veggies were fresh, crisp and perfectly layered. nYes, presentation means a lot as well.",2
"Wanted Mexican food and have eaten at the one in Planet Hollywood and loved it. This one was not as good as the one in PH, but it was good. We ordered chips and salsa for the table, which came with 4 different salsas. I liked the mild and hot red salsas the best. The food everyone got was great. Service was quick, ambiance was a little boring inside where we ate.",2
"This place is DELICIOUS! I had their Whole Hog Skillet with extra ham, and their Wild Berry Cakes. nIncredible. So good. Service is great . the patio is great . it's all great. The only thing in my opinion that keeps it from being 5 stars is that you can't do a ""call ahead "" or make reservations. Lines can get very very long, which can be annoying. All in all though, it's worth the wait. ENJOY!",2
"Finally, a dentist that is kind, gentle, and a true professional! I'm so grateful that Dr. Gonzalez and her staff made my daughter's first dental cleaning such a nice experience. Dr. Gonzalez is great! I love that her clinic is eco friendly. Our family loves her clinic. I recommend her clinic to everyone!",2
"Does it really take 1 hour to make ONE coffee? This was my first time at cartel, the coffee was good but they gave me the wrong cup of coffee and asked if I would be okay with that coffee instead.after I said no I want the coffee I ordered they took 45 mins to make it. I completely understand it was busy but my order should have been priority. Very disappointed.",1
"Had a great experience at Valley Eyecare. Went to see Dr. Lindsey Clyde and her team in Dec. 2010. Complete eye exam that was explained to me at the time, they worked with my insurance and helped my select two pairs of prescription glasses that are fun functional. Thank you Valley Eyecare! This is my doctor of choice.",2
"Atmosphere is great! Hamburger was barely mediocre at 17.60 for a plain one. Meat was tasteless in a ball, so didn't fit bun well. Fries were good. French onion soup not hot enough wasn't that brown crusty melted cheese we like and too. Sweet. Asked for mayo got ONE Teaspoon no kidding. Service was not greatest, so overall, not going back rated it one star especially since it was overpriced ",1
"Very disappointed. No pillow cases on any of the pillows. It took 7 hrs. for housekeeping to correct the problem. I received a call from housekeeping at 3am about a refrigerator I didn't request. We are still waiting for the sewing kit we asked for. Poor service, not clean, and long lines. We may not be back.",1
"Do not use the drive thru at this location! They have messed up my order 5 out of 5 times I have used the drive up. They act like they don't care. My husbands sandwich toppings end up on mine, mine end up on his and we have never gotten a sandwich made correctly. Save yourself the annoyance of paying 7 for a sandwich just to get it wrong.",1
"The fried rice is typically too dry, chicken can be impressive if you are there for a fresh batch. Overall it's a hit and miss, more often a miss. Considering the masses of college students, faculty and staff that go through the line. Also that it needs to fit into a college budget, I probably shouldn't be surprised that my taste buds are rarely blown away.",1
"Horrible! Dry, flavorless chicken. No meat on the ribs though what little meat there was admittedly good . Soggy corn as though it was sitting in water all day. Only two microcups of butter for four pieces of bread and three ears of corn. No personality at the counter and the napkins were held hostage by the lackluster employees.",1
"This place is amazing. I loved both the cocktails I had, one I chose myself and one off bar tender Jasons recommendation. The menu is so extensive it makes me want to get back on OK Cupid to make boys buy me drinks here. That's how much I want to try everything on this menu. This place is so good it squashing feminism.",2
"While ice cream might be delicious, service was horrendous. We tried ordering ""Child Creations "" in a waffle bowl for kids 12 and under , and the girl kept on saying ""but it's a tiny scoop of ice cream.it's just a tiny scoop of ice cream. "" As parents we are aware of kids portions. sizing, but the way she was demanding us to get a bigger size was very condescending.",1
"Best pizza in the valley! They make everything in house the crust, the sauce, even the cheese! We usually start with the Mediterranean Salad which has crisp lettuce, feta cheese crumbles, black olives in a really light vinaigrette it's huge and so good! Then we always get a large pepperoni and onion pizza so good we haven't been able to try anything else. Go try it! You won't be disappointed.",2
"Crummy music, VERY Crowded dance floor, if there was a fire we all would have been dead. Bouncers are really rude, no seating, no free waters or sodas for the DD. It was really gross, the nicest part was the ladies rest room. Also the glass cups broken all over the dance floor and the fire hazard really freaked me out, I couldn't get out of there fast enough! I'll never go back to Haze, ever.",1
"Came here for dim sum to cure that hangover from last night. Pretty much your standard dim sum place, has everything from siu mai, shrimp rice noodles, har gow, etc. I didn't really find these outstanding. I've had better. We came pretty early before the rush, so it was pretty dead. Service was good. Although when I asked for chili pepper sauce they gave a tiny sauce plate.",1
"Overhyped as well as priced. My pizza was forgettable and the crowd seems to be younger hipsters who are all happy to see the hostess and bartenders though I doubt they know each others names . If you go there, avoid Fri Sat. I'd rather do NYPD pizza, unless you're more concerned about loud conversations than food.",1
"I wasn't a huge fan of this area of town at first. Now that I have visited a couple of times, its starting to grow on me. I'm not a huge shopper, but if I was, this would be the place. I usually just visit the movie theater but I'm slowly making my way around to the restaurants and shops too. This is a great way to spend a nice day, window shopping, dining, just hanging out.",2
"I'm with the band Hugo's should not be missed. It is as it should be when one parts with hard earned dollars for another to prepare and serve them a nice dinner. Isn't that what we all want? Excellent cuisine, unobtrusive service, and chivalry. Save room for dessert and the Kona coffee a nice finish.",2
"Great people, clean and organized place. Check in and check out went very smooth unlike some other reviews. We are from Southern California and the new customer setup over the phone went very well. I appreciate their vaccination policy. They took great care of my baby Zack. They seemed genuinely concerned for his welfare. For his first time at a boarding, all went well. We will return.",2
"Food was good, but service was Terrible. Called ahead to make reservation and was assured a round table for 6. When arrived on time, they said they gave table to some friends and it would not be available for another hour or so. Then, rude waiter acted like he had a real bad day. Time To check out other good Italian in fountain hills.",1
"Sean V and Ashton helped us today and they were great! Sean totally understood our food allergies and was clearly well trained on how to handle them. He has a great attitude which made the experience so nice for us. Ashton was super friendly and sweet. And, of course, the food was great as usual. You have done it again, Chiptole! Thank you!",2
"Totally worth the drive from Scottsdale. The food is delicious, and is not pre packaged, such a nice change for a coffee joint. Support local business, Starbucks has nothing on Lux other than a million locations. Keeping the service consistent would help. Sometimes it's stellar sometimes it's horrid. Guess it depends on how their day is going. Still was in 3 times today shameless",2
"Considering the price of 20 it had a variety of breakfast items and lunch items. They had a well stocked dessert bar area to include pies, crepes, cookies, donuts, breakfast pastries, and cotton candy. This was my favorite part. We came here because the Mirage cravings breakfast was 35 and the night before we had a bad experience. We would definitely come here again.",2
"No internet, still. No hot water, unless you let it run for 30 minutes to get to a luke warm temp. Weird sandy gritty residue on sheets. Hard beds.the pillow top doesnt help much. All of this combined means I didnt get any work done and I slept pretty crappy, with no nice hot shower to wash it all away.",1
Not happy with Marvel.have to agree that they don't care about their customers. I ordered 10 tons of rocks and scheduled a 7am delivery time. It is now 11 30am and they still aren't here. I lost half a day of work and have been paying workers who have been standing around all morning because the materials aren't here. Very frustrated with this place and will never use them again!,1
"The good Nice hotel room and nice facility. Reasonable rate. Got comp for buffet. Like their pool. Bad Costed about 40 on taxi to come back from strip. They have shuttle, but it ends at 9 45pm except Satursday night. Buffet is a bit overrated does not have sashimi that I like . Casino doesn't have enough variation in terms of table games.",2
"The Girls and I were in Vegas for a fun trip and stopped by here one early evening for a bite. Food was REALLY yummy we had nachos, mahi mahi tacos and Bacon Bleu burger AMAZING . Our waitress MINDY G was AWESOME! So friendly and energetic! She recommended we get a ""YOUNG B TCH "" for our fun drink and we were SO GLAD she did! Would definitely go back! MINDY YOU ROCK! ",2
"I've been to LV nails twice, and I love love love love it. So clean, so professional, and amazing work. I love the new management, and their quality assurance. They make sure the customers are always taken care of. Highly recommend this place. Thanks Amy for remembering me and my friend after 1 visit. 0 and thanks Lily for the outstanding job on my faded nails.",2
I don't care for too much sonic but what i do like sometimes is the happy hour from 2 4 for the drinks. Tater tots aren't too horrid either. I love the idea of the Texas toast with a burger patty and what not but i never tend to crave sonics so its rare for me to make a stop since Mcdonalds is half a mile away with obviously better deals than sonic.,1
"I went for brunch. I was really expecting more or exceptional flavors. I sat at the bar and the service was so so. I was in and out in 20 minutes so that was good. I traveled across the strip to try the place out walking away feeling that I wouldn't do it again. Overall, the food was good and above average.",2
"Really didn't have good service when me and my friend went to try it since it was near our area. The waitress took our orders, but never delivered one of the dishes we asked for. After when we got the check we were charged for it, so told them it was never delivered so they took it off. Overall the food was mediocre. Don't think I'd ever return here.",1
"Such great customer service! Not to mention the food was fresh, fast and inexpensive for a seafood place. I had the fisherman's sampler, torritos and chipoltle shrimp and man there was enough food for any army. The place was packed and I still managed to eat and pay in under an hour. Five stars in my book!",2
"2nd time, can't find a groomer in Ahwatukee since moving here tried another place it was stinky so tried here again the groomers owners are great people but I am disappointed with the haircut again and that I can't communicate with them what I want a normal haircut for yorkies been able to do in the past .",1
"I don't usually write about a chain restaurant but the service was excellent. Drinks were always filled, dirty dishes were always cleared and staff was consistently friendly. Above and beyond friendly actually. AND it was a Saturday night! If I ever want Chili's I'll opt to drive out of the way. The thing that would make it 5 stars? A little bit of a juicer steak!",2
I was visiting from Minneapolis last weekend and the family tour director chose YC's because it would accommodate the vegetarian in the bunch. She was thrilled to see tofu offered. The cashier was helpful in guiding us to which size bowl to pay for. The food was very good and I would happily return if I ever get to Scottsdale again. You should go!,2
Went to blue agave last night for taco Tuesday. My girlfriend and I got food poisoning and still have symptoms 24 hours later. Beware of dollar tacos because taco Tuesday will lead to vomit vednesday. Sever was nice though so I will give it a star. I pretty much don't want to ever eat Mexican food ever again for the rest of my life.,1
"Went here because of its great location. However . Will never return. Actually never reviewed any place before. But this place made me so mad. So ripped off. Charged me more than the sign said. Horrible service and when I showed the guy some spots I wanted him to vacuum really good, he brushed me off and complained about me to other employees! Seriously. Don't give them your money!",1
"Oh yeah! This place is awesome! It's open late at night too! I tried four of their sandwiches, my favorite being ""the italian. "" nI've also tried the tuna melt, the earl's club, and the main earl's roast beef sandwich. They're all good. The bread is perfectly toasted. Reasonable price. If you come to las vegas and are looking for a cheap meal snack, don't miss this place!",2
I really liked this place. It bills itself as an American breakfast with a twist. It sure does have a nice twist. I had the corned beef hash. Nothing normal. This hash has monster chopped fried potatoes and the corned beef was not little chunks of beef but long tasty strings. The twist is also the meal comes with cantaloupe and a slice of orange with a sprig of sage in the toast.,2
"The food is amazing and the service is fantastic! Super friendly staff with great recommendations. We ordered the chicken chow fun, salt and pepper beef, and orange chicken and followed our waitress's advice on adding some extra spice to it. The food was delicious! The best I've had in AZ. Will definitely be back.",2
This place is close to my work so I will have a lunch a day a month or so when I want to be filled up and want some decent Hawaiian food. I wouldn't call it authentic because I LOVED me some L L when it was in town and there are a few other restaurants that are a little better. This hits the spot when I'm craving some mac salad and some BBQ beef get the mini meal.,2
"Genuinely friendly employees. Fast food that doesn't taste like fast food. What I really like, though, is that the kids meals come with books! And they even have board books for kiddos under 3! If you have a smaller appetite, you could order the kid's meal for yourself and then give the book to your kid. Win win!",2
"Worst dental office I have ever been to. They will charge you whenever they get a chance, even when they promised NOT to! If you already paid your bills, make sure you keep all proves, since they are medics without any basic accounting knowledge, they do not update their record, so they will keep asking you for payment unless you give them proves!",1
"Love and miss this place. A hit and miss at times, I guess that depends on the cook but most of the time you can taste the love in the food. They are fast when they deliver, ""GREAT "" wor wonton soup or as my friend calls it ""kitchen sink soup "" cause it has it all in there every meat and veggie a winter must have. The pineapple chicken is bomb. Great pork fried rice and fried shrimp! yum!",2
"Love love LOVE this place! The service is great, the people are friendly and the food is delicious. The decor inside is so well designed and the high ceilings add to the amazing ambiance. The music is never too loud either so it's a great place to catch up with friends. Highly recommend this place for locals tourists too looking for a relaxing evening out.",2
The wings are terrible! They did not have very good flavor. They were giant and didn't seem to have enough sauce. It was hard to even try to get the chicken off the bone. Not that we really wanted to since the taste was so bad but we had already purchased them so felt obligated to eat them. I do not suggest this restaurant to anybody.,1
"Fancy El Pedgregal location, yet the food was mediocre at best. Portions were a bit small. French toast came out at almost room temperature. Prices were high, as if this was a full service place but it isn't. Nearly all typical breakfast items on the menu except for pancakes, which seemed a bit odd. Everything but pancakes.",1
"This is a clean well lighted store. Their produce always seems to be fresh and their seedless melons are fantastic in season . I really like their deli meats, but beware there can be line at any time, day or night. The only negative thing I can post, Some items are priced higher than some of the surrounding stores. All in all, I'd recommend this Fry's to anyone.",2
OMG I'm in LOVE with this place. I grew up and lived in this area and have been going to Bonito Michoacan for years. It's the best mexican restaurant that I know of in Las Vegas. I always start off with thethe part. Their steak pacado is my 1 dish! I love this place so much that everytime my husband asks me where we want to go on my birthday I choose Bonito! MMM! 5 stars all the way!,2
"I received a card for this place from a Verizon store when my phone has issues, and i had no insurance. Dan was very quick and repaired my phone for a very nice price! His first fix did not take care of the issue, but after taking it back to him he was able to properly diagnose the issue and resolve it with no extra cost. I would definitely recommend going to see Dan if you have any phone issues.",2
"I give it a 2 for the food selection and that's about it. From the greeting and customer service, it was horrible. It was actually me and hubby's first time trying out shabu and nobody helped us and even when we asked they didn't bother to explain anything. We just has to google what to do just to eat.",1
The response for the JT was nice but those burns were from the wires at the gates of hell and not a rug burn as he claims. I would never go here again and would caution anyone to go there and waste their money. JT response is another example of how rude these people are and how much they disrespect patrons who attend their attractions. Avoid at all cost!,1
I would prefer naked fish over nagoya. I ordered a hamachi and it look all burnt and hard as a rock when I was eating it. Im not much of a complaint but being a sushi restaurant. Should you be more focused on quality of your dish and care how it would attract more customers? I give it 1 out of 5 stars. Maybe they will improve?,1
Thumbs down! Low quality overpriced food. Can't say much about the service everybody else got but my waitress disappeared every 15 minutes. Total time wasted from beginning to end of my meal for two people was 70 minutes. Too long for a burger and chicken sandwich. Nothing special here. Will not return.,1
"So this review has gone down 1 star to be fair I am unsure why I rated it 5 stars in the first place.I must have been high on Peroxide! . nHowever I really do love Superdrug! I always love the range of make up , girlie travel neccessities and its so well located, not far from the train station so its always a must stop before running for the train.",2
"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food in Arizona, do NOT go to Macayo's. It's a standard chain restaurant which has decent food but not representative of the true pizzazz that Mexican food has to offer. If you MUST go to Macayo's, go for some margaritas during happy hour and then kick it over to a better, local place like Valle Luna.",1
"Essential the same scene over and over again with an ABBA song thrown in there for good measure. Was a frustrating show to watch as the characters fear of confrontation was evident in every scene. I'm wondering how this is a ""smash hit ""? If you HAVE to check it out go to Goldstar.com. you can get discount tickets there.",1
"Worst dining experience in Vegas. It took me twenty minutes just to get a water at a half full bar. Food came out cold and many products, specifically ranch are not in house products like every other hooters. I will never go back. At one point I genuinely thought Jon Taffer might walk in and start yelling, god knows he should.",1
Prices were out of this world high. We walked in looked at pricing on just a couple items that we have been looking at and their price was so high and so out of line we both just turned right around and walked out. I dont mind paying more for something to have it now but they take their high prices to another level. Just not that impressed with them.,1
"AMAZING! Hands down one of the best barber shops in all of Arizona. Great atmosphere, very clean establishment and Professional Barbers. My barber knew exactly what I wanted by just telling him a 3 metal and skin taper! I will never go any where else to get trimmed up while in Arizona! 5 Stars all day and very worth the wait. Thank You",2
"The only reason this is getting 2 stars is because the Filet Tataki was amazing. But this is sushi, not a steakhouse. nWe have been waiting on our check for quite some time and didn't even bother to finish our food because all of it, was not to our liking. nWe wish out check would come so we can get to I Out",1
"Relaxing, Not Loud, Very Friendly Service. Carne Asada Fajita was solid, not the best ever, but really good. Chips, Salsa, Guac for starters was great. They are not cheap with the Guac you get a great portion with your entree and your chips. Best part you can do your own free refills! Get the sopapilla's for dessert. You get 3 big ones. Saved one for the next morning's coffee.",2
"The food tasted good but wasn't hot. In fact, it was barely warm. The place was a ghost town at 7 pm on a Tuesday which isn't a good sign considering all the promotion lately and the size of the restaurant. 28 later for two people, we are leaving hungry, disappointed and wishing we would have listened to other yelpers. We will not be returning.",1
No security cameras Gates are always open or having malfunctions my roommate's car got hit and the office will not take any responsibility MY APARTMENT GOT ROBBED 6 other apartments. and the gates are still open BUGS BUGS BUGS The office manager Thomas S is an ass. The big manager of Picerne Group hang up on me When my lease is up I'M MOVING OUT! I wish I was reading some reviews before I moved in,1
Food was excellent. I had the spaghettti pomodoro and my husband had the spaghetti puttanesca. I really liked the sauce. The wait was less than twenty minutes but the host served a group of people to their seats before us that made me angry because we had been waiting and they had just arrived. The meals arrived quickly and the dinner rolls were yummy too.,2
"This is a great fast food burger. You won't find a better FAST food burger IMO, but you will find plenty of better burgers in town. I really like the toppings and dressings.their Japanese twist on the burgers. Very flavorful and the is right. The line can get a little crazy if you go late a night, but it is worth it. See for yourself ",2
"I've been here 4 times in the last 2 months and have always had a good experience. Food was always warm and good, waitresses are always quick and damn hot. Not sure why this place is getting so many bad reviews. Maybe I'm lucky? You lost a star for one of my menus being drenched in some type of cocktail beverage. Yuck, man. Clean the menus, please.",2
"If I weren't held hostage at hockey lessons twice a week, I'd NEVER eat at 18 Degrees. The staff is friendly but food is very mediocre and overpriced for the taste.and I've been coming here for years so I've tried just about everything. The wings, if ordered well done, and the mac cheese are good though. No complaints about Over Easy.",1
"We found a bandaid with the panang. We ordered panang with chicken, not panang with bandaid. When we told the waiter, he argued that it wasn't a bandaid. I'm sorry, there's no mistaking a bandaid! The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it! If you like bandaid on your dish, this I the place to go! Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars. This place definitely was a ZERO.",1
"We went to Mez for a group dinner and had very good service. The food was actually good too and the portions are big. Unfortunately, I can't get over the location I'm not a fan of the 'Epicenter' and the cheesy mall feel. The theatre escalators exit into the bar which is awkward. The bar tender was also struggling and had to take our order 3 times.",1
"I use this trail frequently to walk my dogs and take them swimming in the Mon. It's when my dogs are at their happiest, paddling around in shallow water and chasing waves. Save your urge to warn me about all the dangers associated with the above. I've heard it all before. I love this little sleeper gem of a trail. nDenise",2
"My Bavarian Beer Stew was dry I don't think it could be fairly called a stew because there was no liquid in it. On the bright side I got to watch my dining partner eat the Sconnie Egg and it tasted as delicious in my mind as it did in his mouth. Beer yup, lots. Friendly eager to please waiter who apologized when our entrees were delivered right along with our appetizers. Who's running the kitchen?",1
"Absolutely love this place! Such an awesome idea having all the games. We have a blast every time we come here. The place is a little small but it seems like everyone always finds ways to make room and we always end up making new friends. Owners are friendly and the wife makes delicious treats!. Trust me, use your check in offer! Cheers!",2
"Very tasty! The handmade tortillas are wonderful, the taste and the heat are very good, tender pork rib meat and the stacked enchilada's are Muy Delicioso! Decor is actually pretty cool, especially considering it is in an auto repair complex, maybe that adds to the experience! We will certainly be going back!",2
"It's really unfortunate that the service at this place sucks so much, because I really like the beer selection and the food is decent as well. But every time I'm in there, they are incredibly understaffed. Once, my friend and I sat at the bar for 15 minutes without a drink! It was ridiculous. And once you order food, you're really in for the long haul.",1
"Owner better get a handle on this place. I've been sitting here for two hours to get an ""Express Detail "" not that impressive workmanship either that would warrant the wait. I'm not sure if they think they get paid by the hour or what, but I've had FULL DETAILS that have been done faster and much better. I'd go somewhere else.",1
"Their BBQ is pretty tasty, but the other day I was craving a burger and fries and figured it had to be decent. I couldn't have been more wrong. One of the worst burgers in recent memory the cheese wasn't even melted and the fries were nothing to be happy about either. I think it was bad enough I will look elsewhere next time I am in the mood for some pulled pork.",1
What a great experience! My flight on Southwest was delayed so I searched for some liquid courage and found Zinc. Was able to get a seat at the bar had a FABULOUS waiter. I don't remember his name but he was tall and talking about triathlons. nI ordered a Rose and a pork belly sandwich absolute heaven in an airport. I can't wait to fly again and hope to be delayed! Not really. ,2
TOTALLY LAME! THEY SAY ONE PRICE ON THE WEB SITE THEN CHARGE YOU MORE IF YOU ARE STAYING SOMEWHERE NICE! WE WERE STAYING AT ONE OF THE CLOSEST PLACES AND THEY STILL CHARGD US MORE THAN PPL ALL THE WAY DOWN THE STRIP. THEN THEY TOLD US TO CALL ONE HOUR BEFORE AND WE DID. SORRRRYYY! CAN'T HELP US! and they did not care. So make your reservation 24 hours and not get stranded like us.,1
"I only wish that I could have the whole menu in one sitting! What a great place, super nice, friendly and fast service, accommodate special requests quickly and with a smile and the god was fantastic. After a great Reuben, I splurged some calories on a cheesecake and wow, probably the best cheesecake I ever had! Definitely will be a regular here!",2
Strange location.out of the way of Scottsdale's more touristy strip but it was worth the trip. The Dr. Pepper shortribs and green chile mac and cheese were outstanding couldn't keep my friends' paws off my plate! The duck and fundito were good but I'll take my ribs and mac any day. Service was attentive. Definitely would go back!,2
"I have really loved z pizza in the past, but the last two times I have been quoted a delivery time and it has taken twice as long, over an hour and a half both times. The first time I thought it was a fluke so I gave it another chance and the same thing happened. We will be eating delivery pizza from pizza a metro from now on. Same quality pizza and much better customer service.",1
I wish i could give higher rating. Not comparable to buffalo exchange in alb. Nm. The women there usually are very sparse in choosey with the clothes. I have brought true religion jeans they turned down. 200 jeans in perfect condition. I say go to other stores that buy sell trade. They might offer more. They did for me. ,1
"This is kind of a quirky place outside dining only, cash only, no restrooms but it's worth it for the sauce and the food and for me to say a place with no restrooms is worth it is saying something . This reminds me that I haven't been there in awhile. There's a reason I have a ""I'm Addicted to Pete's Fish Chips "" bumper sticker on my truck.",2
Massaged grounded Kobe beef. Does it get any better? I asked for medium rare and had the patty just dripping with blood all over my plate. Had them slap on some avocado on the burger with a wheat bun and it was phenomenal. I had a few of the sweet potato fries and that was great as well. We sat at the bar because the wait was fairly long and we had a flight to catch. Service was great.,2
The men's bathroom is always a mess with multiple toilets out of order and a layer of some sort of liquid covering the whole bathroom floor. The two patio bars usually only have two bartenders and take forever to get a drink. Also if you buy a table no matter how much money you spend they will kick you off your table right when you finish all the bottles you paid for.,1
"We just stopped here on a whim for lunch and let me tell you, if you like burgers this is a great choice. I indulged in the 1842 Burger with pepper jack cheese and it was bar none one if the best burgers I have eaten. A beautiful friendly waitress was on top if all of our dining needs and my beer was never empty. If your there definitely try it out, you won't be disappointed ",2
"They carry the best products. Their staff is like one big family and getting your hair or nails done is like a social event. They are reasonably priced, in a great location, clean, friendly and accommodating! If you're looking for a new salon call them and they will have the stylist you're looking for.",2
One of the best places to find high quality organic foods for reasonable pricing. We were able to sit outside at a table with a fire pit which just made the experience even better. The drink list is extensive and all that we had were super good. Will be going back to try something new on their menu.,2
"hey Mike F. Please let me know if you tried the meat yet. please! nI purchased a box of meat today from guy driving buy. he had a great pitch deal and i guess i fell for it. duh! nbut now i'm trying to research the company and I'm coming up empty! it's all very shady indeed. i'm afraid to eat the meat now. awe man, what to do? ok peeps i'll come back with an update if i learn more.",1
I've stayed here a few times now and I really enjoy the scene at this place. Its a place for the younger crowd to hang out in. The casino is clean and staff is really cool. Won big at this place. Had great killer margaritas and food was delicious. The rooms both times I stayed here had great views! Love this place.,2
"Three of us had dinner tonight. All dishes were great! We had the chicken teriyaki bento, pork katsu plate, miso soup and the sushi bowl. Everything was fresh and delicious! We also found out that no MSG is used. The owner is very pleasant and nice. We are sorry that we didn't discover this place sooner as we leave AZ in a couple of days. Prices were reasonable too.",2
"Staff was very friendly! They always take a moment to chat me up while making my drink. And they always make my drink right. The big windows get too much sun for the shades to compensate for, so half the seating of the store is too warm during our summers here in Phoenix. Sometimes its hard to find a seat on the cool side during peak hours. The net is always up and there is enough parking spaces.",2
The food is awesome. I love i out burger nothing compares. typically I give places that are really awesome 4 stars. but this paticular location gets an extra star. do you wanna know why. ITS BECAUSE OF THE LEMONS! they are perfect. go for the burgers. but stay for the lemons. they are cut so perfect I just want to squeeze them.,2
"DO NOT RECCOMEND! Chimichangas were hard as a rock. nChips Salsa was free. nService is eh the decor is dreadful. nAlso they have a DJ posted by the window? nWhy? Not sure, I guess they want me to suffer through pit bull songs while I complain about my crap tacos. Downtown has some good spot, this is NOT one of them.",1
"Jase is an amazing speaker coach and business development coach. Bringing his years of expertise, he is able to elicit the passion of his clients to transform their marketing. His approach is very real and down to earth. I would highly recommend Jase if you are seeking the expertise to develop your marketing, branding or business message.",2
"So Sad, maybe it used to be good? but it sucks now, they had a few stores that I enjoyed that are all gone in only the past couple years and not much is left it is almost empty WTBleep some really good stores were there! they are even clearing out rows to make more parking? I went recently to order a gift and the store was gone like all the others I liked. So sad",1
French pastries YES! I've tried numerous pastries at Amelie's and my favorites must be their macarons. By god the seasonal pumpkin macaron is like tasting everything there is to love about the fall season in a few small bites. Just wonderful. I love to bring out of towners here after dinner to pick up goodies to take back to the house for later. One of my favorite things about Charlotte for sure.,2
"This is a great Korean restaurant. After san toki closed down, I didn't know where to go to get korean food. Luckily, I found this place. The food is good. Appetizer is good. I'd ordered the bulgogi and spicy tofu soup. A little too much onion on the bulgogi, but it taste fine. The price is a little cheaper than other place too. Setting is not too shabby either. I definitely recommend this place.",2
I first found this restaurant when they first opened and had a great time there with great food. Good tasting friendly service. Last trip there was a flop. Pho was lacking and 6 people in our party orded rice dishes. The meat was mediocre and the tau hu ky smelled. No one finished their soup and we couldn't eat the rice dishes. I vow not to ever go back there.,1
"So good, came to this place after my other go to sushi place caved. Lots to choose from appetizer wise and the rolls are a good size. They have quite a bit to choose from so bring a few friends so you don't fill up too fast.I make this mistake frequently.it's a great place and yes they do have drink specials!",2
"Yes it's a chain, but the food is ALWAYS delicious. I love every shrimp dish they offer. The traditional Italian dishes are average, but my hubby loves them. Service can be hit or miss. I just love the quality of food enough to forgive the occasional semi bad waiter. forgetful, have to ask multiple times for one thing not a biggie.",2
"Be sure to try the hummus sampler! Different flavors that I have never enjoyed before, all really good. Loved the outdoor seating, perfect for a sunny, spring day! I tried a lamb dish.silver skin was not removed before cooking WAY TO TOUGH TO EAT! Others in my party really enjoyed their food. I would give it another try.just stay away from the lamb. Sides were good.",1
"I agree the bubble drinks are very good, but I need more than that when going out for dinner. I order Pad Thai every chance I get and this was not good. There was very little tofu which was ok considering it was soggy and tasteless anyway. Overall, it was inferior to other local restaurants I have tried.",1
"A friend and I came here for drinks and dinner on a Friday night. Neither of us had been there before so we decided to check it out. The bar was about halfway full and not too loud. I decided to get the pork chop. It was ok, but I have definitely had better food. It was little too dry for me. The service was pleasant and a change from the usual that is seen on saint laurent.",1
"DO NOT waste your time or money on this RIP OFF spot! Old, cold fries, crapy frozen burger patty at a Cadillac price! I would not let this place be the first or last BAD Vegas experience! I have had better burgers at a gas station heated in a microwave! I have never felt so screwed by restaurant in my life! 16.95 for Cheeseburger Fry, are kidding me!",1
"I've gone to many casinos, bet at many sports books, and I actually like the environment of this one. It's always busy on Sundays. And Meh on Saturdays and Mondays. There is plenty of seating, and close by food options. It's 24 hours, which is a plus! The writers have always been fairly nice and helpful.",2
Disclaimer I remember Z'Tejas when it was first created by Guy Villavaso and Larry Foles in Scottsdale. I ate there yesterday at one of the chain's generic locations and was very disappointed. The place wreaks of a casual dinning chain. Gone is the cutting edge southwest cuisine that made it great. If you want a southwest style Marie Callender's by all means give it a try.,1
"This is my favorite thai restaurant, I have tried 10 other thai restaurant s but I still go back to this place.the service is normally excellent and very friendly however with the reopening the we're short staff. We had their pad thai which we love but now there is only one shrimp. Their red curry with green beans is also one of my favorites. You also need to try their coconut ice cream",2
"Meh. Service was friendly. The burger patty did not seem to have any seasoning. The haystack onion straws were good but served very greasy, the bottom half of the order was not edible due to the amount of oil. Sweet potatoe fries were great. I did not find the product worth the price and would rather save a few bucks and go to I' Out or spend a few more and go to a full service restaurant.",1
"What a nightmare. There is signage everywhere that sends Gold Plus members upstairs when the upstairs office is closed see picture . You'd think they could add hours or something. So you get to carry your luggage up and down just to go to the back of a busy line. Despite double confirmed reservations, there is always a problem here. The staff are rude and unhelpful. Use another car rental place.",1
Bacon wrapped prawn wontons are unbelievable. The prawns stay tender while the bacon gets crispy. Sauce is perfect as well. Seabass with drunkeoodles is delicious and useful after drinking. You'll spend a bit waiting if you don't have a reservation but the bar helps the time go by with a legit wine selection.,2
"I was definitely not impressed with this restaurant. There wasn't enough variety and my street noodle dish was subpar at best. It lacked any wow factor. The only dish I would recommend is the steamed pork bun. Literally the only thing I will go in there for. Otherwise, I would not suggest going here. It is overhyped.",1
This is my second time here and I love it. Today I wanted what I had the last time which was a meat and cheese platter with fruit. They didn't have that plate so they made me one fresh. It wasn't exactly the same because their center cup was filled with pecans instead of apricot. But no big deal. It was great. This is now my go to place when I have time. So much better than StarStrucks.,2
"Geez, it only took them 20 seasons to actually become interesting and now Kurt Warner is probably going to retire, they'll go back to be ignored. They used to play home games where sometimes visiting fans outshouted the locals. Maybe now they'll finally have an identity in the desert but it sure has taken them a long time to do that.",1
"The food was delicious but the service was dismal. They rush you through the line expecting that you know exactly how it works even if you have never been there. If you ask a question they look at you like you're a bother, and don't take the time to explain how their menu works. The bathrooms were in bad shape and there was no changing table. Not sure if we will return. Overall not happy.",1
The people that run the drive thru are a joke. Apparently it is really difficult to understand that someone wants a large coffee and not a small. They also do not make any attempt to make it right for any of the times I've been there and they have messed up my order. I filled out a survey online let's see if anybody from the store actually follows up as I have requested them to!,1
"In town for work, yelped for breakfast and found this place. Had the corned beef hash, kinda non traditional cut in strips instead of chopped, but still very yummy and portions that are barely finishable! nYes, the coffee cake is all everyone says it is. I'll be back for more from the large and diverse menu",2
"Seems like this particular Starbucks is always understaffed. The wait is always forever and they often make the drinks wrong! A couple times they handed me someone else's black coffee when I ordered a hazelnut macchiato, and of course its after I left the drive thru that's when I found out. How inconvenient it is to go back to get the right one.",1
"Fresh, Light, delicious meals at a decent price I have been here for several events b day parties, Sunday brunch, girls night, date night, etc. and it fits any occasion. During the day, it's nice to get some AZ sun on their patio. At night, the candles and ambiance is inviting. Also, their service is FANTASTIC, they are truly concerned with making your experience a good one. Happy Eating!",2
This place is awesome! I've been looking for a local place to buy quality food and they have all the good brands. I picked up cans of Wellness for less than I had previously paid at Petco. I also got some nice samples of treats that my girl Clementine is really loving. One of the owners was helping me while I was there and she couldn't have beeicer!,2
"so. i thought that they were suppose to be selling chicken strips. not chickeuggets. it was great when it first opened up in las vegas, but it seems that the quality has severely gone down. should have seen my face when i first came back to vegas expecting the great chicken strips that i had left behind. i wouldn't recommend it as i would have before.",1
"Employee uses their cell phones with gloves on their hands and makes sandwiches with same gloves. Dirty food, also dirty finger nails, dirty shirts, dirty sagging pants. Nasty employees with nasty food! nAlso took 30 minutes to get the sandwich with only one employee. nThis location should be closed down.",1
"We went back about a month or so ago and my wife noticed that the steaks taste a bit different. She found out from staff that they no longer grill the meat with charcoal, thus losing the flavor of the ""Charcoal Room "". Still okay, but not the same. Hopefully if they get enough feedback they might change back.",2
"Wedding soup was like how Grandmom used to make it which is a very good thing. However, lasagna was much too heavy on cheese and noodles where boiled too long, calamari was very brittle with little flavor. nService was mediocre at very best as my glass was empty majority of eve. nWorse than Macaroni grill.",1
Booked a suite for 3 nights and was promised that there we would receive a set of buffet tickets for each night. TOTAL LIE! Service was also horrible. We asked for extra blankets the first night and they were never delivered. We asked again for extra blankets the second night and housekeeping brought them by throwing the blankets at me! Not going back ever again.,1
"I don't know enough about the alteration business to give this place 5 stars since that comes with knowledge of the industry. But all I can say is my suit fits perfectly, was done on time, and cost about 90 for a complete revision! Had my pants and jacket taken in, and sleeves shortened and altered.",2
"Looked at the menu outside. Expected an up scale place but was greatly disappointed. Drunk guys at the bar playing a chugging game, guys wearing sandals and muscle shirts with hairy armpits exposed, not to mention the fresh sweat shop smell that accompanied them. This I would expect over at UNLV but not at one of the nicest places on the strip. They need to have a dress code.",1
"Braised wild boar pappardelle was hearty rich and delicious minus two flaws 1 Cippolini onions were inedible, and 2 some of the pappardelle was stuck together and therefor a little raw in places. Expected more than plain olives for the amuse bouche at least marinate them. Beautiful decor, especially nice mosaic floor. Service was quick.",2
The brisket was quite good but too fatty. The french fries were alright but there wasn't enough ketchup. The service was slow and somewhat inattentive. There was no ambience in this restaurant. There was no music or mood lighting. FOXNews was on TV and it was just kind of dull. Overall I can say I won't be back.,1
They marinate their pork four days in there is unbelievable as it falls apart in your mouth. Their food is incredibly unique and great and their drinks are awesome as well. We have our own tequila shot glasses there that want to try every tequila you get a free bottle. Just don't try to try them all in one sitting. Haha. nIt's a great place for Mexican food and we recommend it to everybody.,2
"I must be missing the point here. I checked out Concord Mills today and not only could I not find a parking spot I couldn't find anything worth a damn. The usual suspects, Banana Republic Best Buy Nike didn't have anything of quality that I would come to expect. I'm glad I went, so now I don't have to worry about returning.",1
"A hip little eatery that embraces the intricacies of what Vietnamese cuisine possesses when conveyed at its best.The restaurant's sleek, modern and stylish lines match the food. Service was mediocre at best, but at least they weren't rude. Dessert was good, not amazing, but the meal more than made up for it.",2
"Absolutely amazing! An incredible Italian bistro bordering our little Town of Queen Creek. Love the food! Love the ambiance! Love the owner who makes you feel like family And as far as waiting for the home cooked fresh delicacies, all I can say is you get what you wait for, just like any other fine restaurant Love it!",2
"Stayed here on 2 occasions. Both times staff were in the back office nowhere to be found. Had to finally say ""Hello? "" To get a young lady's attention. Check in from there was bleak and bland. Customer service was lacking from the get go. Rooms are decent for the price, but the staff needs work. Not sure if I would return based on the staff alone.",1
"Extra star for the incredible service! The hostess was so so attentive, it was like being invited into someone home. I am really impressed! The food was very tasty! I went with the vegetable curry, and it was mild, sweet, and well balanced. The portions are pretty decent for one person, but if I went again, I would want to try more dishes, family style.",2
"I have to give this place at least 4 stars. Yummiest Pommegranite Margs. To die for I swear, and with the Happy Hour 2 for 1 special, they're really irresistable. The ambiance is refreshing after a long day of being in the nasty heat. The service is like a sweet dream, and the crowd never fails to charm.",2
I loved my experience at Mariee. I had a lot of fun trying on all the Claire Pettibone dresses but in the end loved the Lea Ann Belter dress the best. My mom and two sisters in law had a nice spot to sit while I tried on dresses and everyone who worked there was very patient and helpful. Definitely worth the visit.,2
Worked out at the 6am class while in Vegas for work. It was great to be able to WOD while traveling. Everyone in the class was very nice and I got a great workout. The gym is co located with another gym weightlifting facility. At the time I visited 8 2014 the front room lobby area was under construction.,2
I sprained my ankle 1 week before my wedding. I was on crutches and freaking out that I may not be able to walk down the isle. I saw the great reviews on yelp for Dr Alyesh and figured I'd give him a try. He worked his magic and performed acupuncture and I walked out of his office! I was able to walk and dance at my wedding thanks to him!,2
"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas, that also why the place is always really crowded. nExpect long waiting time, but with awesome service. They always have many servers no matter how late, and very attentive. nPho family style dishes are very good, and have authentic taste. I love their deep fried tofu and fish in claypot.",2
OMG these meatballs will make you cry they are so good! We didn't even order the entree yet and it is sooo delicious! I took my family here for my daughter's 21 bday dinner and from the cocktails to the dessert and coffee everything is delicious! Beautiful atmosphere if you want to dress up or for a casual dinner. Plenty of style and ambiance. Highly recommended!,2
Man it is not hard to make this kind of food and i expect alot more from a place that is advertised as a japanese restaurant. I have eaten here twice and i will not be back. They just don't cut it on the hibachi side of things all the food is either mushy or has no flavor. My tuna roll was fine and thats the only reason for 2 stars. That being said it was not good enough to go here just for sushi.,1
"The Rogue USED to be REALLY cool . down to earth ""punkers "" with brains unlike Jugheads . come with an open mind and your cool. No doubt it was one of Phoenix's few cool hang outs IMHO . too bad the owner fired all the cool staffers over a year ago. Rick a really cool and attractive female bartender . is sadly missed.",1
I learned one thing about myself at this restaurant I do not care for Pastrami at the least. HUGE stacked sandwich that only contains pastrami.I am not stoked to eat this. I ordered a side of fries which turned out to be a very big helping the fries were perfect. I was more in love with my side of french fries than the sandwich ,1
"Moderately dirty, smelly, but not to the point of nausea, service is almost nonexistent, but, when cornered, the salespeople are not hostile. I would give it a solid '3' for its selection being better that at Safeway, but worse than at Lee Lee, if not for absolutely the worst roast duck I ever had the misfortune to taste, or to smell.",1
"Service was terrible! We ordered way too much food and the waitress did not care to tell us. The ""family style "" fajita dinner is basically fajitas for one times 3! Didn't understand their menu at all. They charge for chips and salsa and even extra tortillas when we had three fajita dinners. The best thing was the chips and the guacamole, but we won't be back.",1
"I frequented this establishment years ago, however the quality began to lapse so I moved on. I picked up a groupon a few weeks ago to give them another try. Well even at the discount it was not worth it. The service is still lackluster, the quality of the work leaves much to be desired. I won't be coming back anytime soon.",1
"Friday night guest list. Free for ladies, 20 for gentlemen. Did I mention, free champagne before midnight for the ladies as well? We definitely took full advantage of that. Not a big or glam club by Vegas standards, but I had a great time nonetheless. There was a stage where girls can climb up. We took advantage of that as well Multiple bars, great DJ, excellent crowd. I can't ask for more.",2
"Classes are good but everyone who works there is rude. I feel uncomfortable every time I walk in there. No acknowledgement whatsoever at the front desk. The yoga teacher and receptionist are busy chatting away about what they are doing later that night. Won't even look at me as I am standing there waiting to pay. Nice facility and decent classes, but terrible customer service.",1
"The food is solid, the portions are big, and the prices are great. I keep coming back! Best breakfast in town for the price. I normally get the mother of all hash which comes with two egg and choice of potato pancake, and bagel. I end up splitting it with someone because its a lot of food for under 10 . I just get extra eggs.",2
"Hmmm, we have been continual residents of Urbana from 1956 2012, way longer than heel to toe. Why did I never hear of this place while growing up, from 1962 1980, 1986 1993 ? I can imagine that you stay in business by purchasing brand new shoes BELOW WHOLESALE from people on limited incomes, like my 82 year old mom .",1
"Yuck! This place does not deserve a 1 star at all. I wish I can give it 0. The food was absolutely horrible. The service was average, a little slow for a restaurant that is not busy, the waitress seemed side tracked. The only reason why we came here was because Mom said when she came around 2007 it was pretty good, but NOW WE'RE NEVER GOING BACK. The food was not worth 75 , what a rip off.",1
I really wanted to check this place out. Excited to look around and sign up. The guy in the reception area couldn't be less interested. Since I wasn't feeling like he was going to help me I asked for a brochure. He looked for about 5 seconds and said they were all out. He said I could look online. Bad customer service. Where is the tour they advertise? Very disappointed,1
"My boyfriend and I came in for breakfast after an early horseback riding outing. I ordered the poached eggs in a crisp tortilla shell their version of Eggs Benedict . I don't know if I can go back to classic Eggs Benedict after that. My only complaint is that the coffee was lukewarm. Otherwise, everything else was perfect.",2
"Not the largest selection, but what they have is great. Beautiful and interesting choices. I'm always tempted by several of their fabrics. Every time I've been there, the service has been perfect. I've been asked if I needed help within moments of walking into the store, and I've had my fabrics cut out and purchases rung up very quickly.",2
"What a rip off this place is. I First i'd like to say food is slightly above average, way over priced. I had coupon for a pizza and 20 wings all I asked was for them to do half honey bbq and half hot and they wouldn't budge. I ended up buy 1 medium 1 large and 2 dozen wings it cost 50 dollars. I will settle for Dominos or even red devil, never again.",1
"As an update, the crummy small room has dark and ugly furniture and the shower had very weak water pressure. We moved out of here after one night and into the Venetian, where the rooms were the same price, literally twice as large and the customer service far better. Aria may be new but seriously, what a dump.",1
"We dined here in January with friends and had a really good time. The burgers are huge and flavorful. I had the barbecue bacon burger which was fantastic. My wife had the reuben burger and was disappointed with the quality and flavor. Drinks are pricey here, beware. Also, it gets crowded here quick! Get there before 6 for sure if you want to avoid waiting.",2
"By far one of THE best steakhouses in LV. The bone in ribeye, Flemings potatoes, creamed corn and spinach is so good! On Sundays they have a price fix prime rib special that comes with salad and dessert that is a great value. This is the place we always choose to celebrate very special family events and holidays. We have also had Flemings host large parties for us and they do a great job.",2
"The food here was okay and the prices are reasonable, but one thing I would say is that front line need while serving food need to be keep a lot cleaner than it is now. To many places at the front counter there cross contamination with the food. With some focus and people who care this place can be great.",1
"I came across Big Apple Cleaners after searching on Yelp. I needed an affordable and convenient place for dry cleaning after a recent move and Al Phillips is just not worth the price they charge. Same day service is 1.00 extra per item, but still much less than AP. The staff was friendly and my items were ready when promised and looked fantastic. I will definitely return.",2
"We happened upon this place for lunch, and now have been back a few times! Never heard of the downtown location.but for a quick and yummy lunch it beats Subway and those other 'chains' for sure. Every sandwich I have tried was super yummy warm and toasty .and they even carry IBC Rootbeer in the glass bottles. Definately worth the trip.",2
This store looked much better than the one we went to on Twain at least on the outside. But don't let the facelift fool you it is filthy inside dust on the shelves and dirt on the floor. It was so gross than I wouldn't even shop here. Try Fresh and Easy that's what we did. Vons Safeway clean up your Vegas stores!,1
"Last week I found a DEAD FLY in my noodle. The waiter took away my plate and crossed the noodle off the card. They handed me the full priced check at the end not including the noodle supposedly. I asked for a discount because I almost ate the fly! They then gave me a pathetic 10 discount, while the normal standard should be waiving the entire bill. What can I say.",1
"I'm here for Mother's Day and the service is terrible. I ordered the Shrimp and Scallop entree for 23 and got one shrimp, one scallop and 4 small sticks of fried rice. It was tasty but too small. My husband ordered 4 sushi rolls but they took 40 minutes to come out. So, I ate my entree while he watched me eat it, then, he ate his rolls while I watched him eat. Don't think I'll be back.",1
I love this place because it is unique and doesn't just serve your bacon and eggs which honestly I am tired of having when I go out and pay good money! Granted I am bit peculiar and could not resist having fried chicken and waffles I know sounds terrible but it was pretty good if you want to indulge. I definitely recommend but go there early on weekends as it gets crowed,2
"Came in tonight just to have a bottle of wine. Apparently the wine we chose, a white wine, was not chilled. We asked for a bucket with ice to chill it. That little blip took about 15 mins for the waiter to figure out and inform us. It took several more mins. To bring out the wine. After that, we didn't see the waiter till we asked for the bill. nShould have gone to the Road Runner. Oh well.",1
The the guy directing traffic of which lane to pull in got pissed off because I didn't know what lane his brain was thinking . Then I come to the counter to pay and the guy runs my card as debit and gets mad cause I wanted credit and he didn't even ask me ! They are expensive and super rude will never come here again !,1
"Possibly the best restaurant in Madison! Amazing atmosphere, stellar drinks, and rotating menu of amazingly delicious and usually locally sourced cuisine. I have gone here numerous times and had my mind blown by the food here. Often times I will be lukewarm about a potential ingredient on the menu due to my own eccentricities , but nearly every time I end up loving any dish I get.",2
The delived plant bowl did not resemble the picture on the website. The plants were looking very sickly and it made the arrangement look cheep and unattractive. I can't believe they would send this out. It is embarrassing to know that something like that arrived. looked like a small child put it together.,1
I went here with a friend for dinner and we had a great time! The food was delicious .I had the Lobster Ravioli and it was perfect! My friend had the Eggplant Parmigana and I tasted hers and it was so good.We shared a salad which worked out perfectly. The atmosphere was very nice and loved the white tablecloths. The service was excellent and our waiter was so attentive which we liked.,2
"Hmmm. Not sure about this place. Visited once. Food was decent, but not real hot temperature. More authentic Mexican than Taco Bell. Not the cleanest place. Friendly service. I would not be afraid to try it again, but it did not leave a lasting impression. Oh, and they have large portions. I left stuffed.",1
"Love! Love! Love! This place! My boyfriend and I go here very often! It's again a great first date and for many dates to come! I'm gonna keep this short For drinks get a Melboc or Cucumber Cooler For breakfast get the baked eggs or eggs Benedict Lunch dinner the salmon,meatballs or chicke nIt's great! Have fun!",2
"Hidden gem indeed! The catfish was the best I've ever had. Gumbo was delicious and the don't skimp on the seafood. They deserve their high ratings. Walking in , I was a little skeptical but was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. My friends went to the other eateries in this food court and enjoyed their food as well. Will be back!",2
"Best General Tso's chicken I have ever had, and I'm Chinese. Granted, it's not really an authentic Chinese dish, but this place makes it damn good, and it's cheap! But man, is it spicy! One of the best fast food Chinese places I've ever eaten at. Definitely go here when you have the hankering for Chinese.",2
"Loved RA for over 10 years .went there twice a month with friends and family on Saturday evenings. Excellent music and good food. Corporate recently decided to stop their happy hour on Saturdays. This was always a great incentive to visit! RA has over 75 restaurants in a 4 mile radius, many with Sat happy hours. Its a ghost town in the lounge now.I hope Corporate reconsiders!",1
"Incredible Show! It was better than any other show we saw during our 5 day stay. I was expecting some cool dance moves to some hip hop or techno and not much else. What we got was a very comedic and artistic show. Each dance had a story line, they got the crowd involved, and were actually very funny and entertaining. I would recommend this to just about anyone. Go See the Jabbawockeez!",2
"I always like to use local companies and found Streak Patrol on Yelp. AJ was very professional, came out the same day I called to give me quote which I was very pleased with. AJ was prompt on day of cleaning and did a AWESOME job on my outside windows. I definitely will use Streak Patrol in future for both outside and inside window cleaning.",2
Okay so my husband goes in and stays in line meanwhile a handful employeyes standing around. The GMAIL tells my husband sorry for the wait they are shorthanded. Shorthanded of what good workers. The guy who took the car was really friendly. We needed a new car battery the guy who took the money would not stop yawning. All I thought is have a cup of coffee and lets go. Why are they so slow?,1
"Turkey Devonshire, a ""celebrated "" dish, was tough and dry. Chef's response was that the turkey still back in the kitchen seemed OK. Should have sent it back as waitress suggested. Just didn't want to start eating after my husband finished. His burger was good, though. Wine bottles priced fairly, only 10 if you buy enough in food. Might give another try, but would order something else.",1
Have to say the food was OK not sure if we ordered the right stuff. Asked for White meat didn't get it. nService was horrible credit card machine didn't work. Food is very pricey for what they gave. for 1 leg and 1 thigh fried chicken with side of rice and corn cost me 12 bucks with Water to drink. No lunch specials as well. nI will give it another try but for now buyer beware.,1
"So I love Bomberos. I like the fire pit, and the trees, and the decor. But the thing I love the most is the atun escabeche sp . Salty, sweet, and delicious. n As a side note, my 7 year old daughter loves to come here to hang out and read, apparently Junie B. Jones books fit in really well with the ham and cheese sandwich. n I highly recommend it.",2
"The service was absolutely amazing! The waiter was always on top of it! Our old plates were immediately cleared away and drinks topped off! The selection of food is great! I wish I could try everything. Even being there for 2.5 hours, I couldn't do it! I like how most entrees are individualized! My favorite was the prime rib, olive salad, K BBQ ribs, and let's not forget GELATO!",2
"An elegant, small shopping and dining venue that I wish would catch on a bit better. It's much more tasteful and appealing than Downtown Summerlin. It also has ample parking and easy access. If you're looking for a classy shopping experience in a mall that's easy to navigate and has great restaurants, check out Tivoli Village.",2
Five years ago I reserved two tires at Dukes gave them the exact sizes that I required told him I would be there in 15 minutes to pick up the tires I rolled up with a couple friends of mine from Baltimore who are part of the LGBT community the yinzers at Dukes took one look and told me that the tires were sold they had no more tires.,1
"I liked KGB when I first ate here, but I got an order to go and not only was my meal disappointing, it was potentially dangerous. When I got back to where I was staying and took a bite of my burger, there were grill marks on the outside of my lamb burger, but the inside was so raw it was bleating. I also ordered a chili chocolate shake, which tasted salty, and did not have any chili flavor in it.",1
prime location during summer with the street being closed off. nit's extremely crowded even during weekdays. i'd say the food is passable since there's better just around. alcohol is dirty cheap though. great spot to meet friends and drink the night away while watching sport events or simply catching up. as for anything else? you're better off elsewhere,1
"Always correct and efficient. Also, I think this one tastes better than others. Hah. The employees are pleasant, which is basically a bonus when it comes to fast food. I'm in a love hate with the location hate it because it's just far enough to be annoying but love it because if it was closer I'd probably eat it way too much. Their Ocean Water tastes really, really good. I know odd, but awesome.",2
I really can't say much more than anyone else. It is hidden and you'll probably miss it. It is small and you may not get a table. Service is awesome. The pizza is amazing. Really amazing. It may be the best in Arizona. I don't know if there is better pizza but it sure ain't from Chris Bianco. I just wish they had a Sicilian style.so no 5 Stars.,2
"It'll do in a pinch. I've only been in for breakfast. I overheard a waitress telling another customer that they use pre packaged food egg beaters, etc. It's not gourmet, but it's decent diner esque food. The staff is generally friendly, and quick to get you in and out. It is a little pricey it's airport food, what do you expect? .",1
what a long wait.was it worth it? is anything ever worth the wait? heeeheee.i saved our seat for so long that i actually got up and gave it to the couple standing around with their crepes in tray. i felt so bad that they were just standing and couldn't eat. nget the proscuitto with the cheese and basil! soo delicious! that's it.,2
"Wow! Damn good burger. Had the Harpers Fairly Good Burger and look forward to the next one. A small side of fries would have beeice but not a big deal. Didn't get a drink but looked like a nice selection of beers on tap. Other food items on the menu looked good too. Even though it was pretty busy, the bar tenders were attentive and it didn't take too long to put in my order.",2
"Most delicious Chinese food I've ever had. Everything was fresh and seasoned to perfection. I had the dinner combo of sesame chicken. It came with an egg roll, two cheese puffs which were amazing , lo mein, and fried rice. I would suggest this place to anyone who supports local businesses and fresh tasty food.",2
the place is suppose to be an upscale taco bar its just plain weird. nthe only reason I gave it a try cuz I had promotional offers. the place has skeletons and motor bikes etc all over the walls and they were playing weird music like power pop type music which was really annoying. nthe service and food could have been better as well,1
"This place was amazing. I took my girlfriend here for out 2 year anniversary and she loved it. I had made reservations months in advance in hopes of the patio dinning area which I got. The servers was great and friendly. The food fantastic I had the salmon, she had the lobster tail and we shared the bacon potatoes. The view of the fountain was amazing. Highly recommend going.",2
"As usual, Great food , but, the service AND the wait even though half the bar is empty has become unacceptably bad!There's Absolutely no reason to make customers wait in line for an extra 22mins when 6 chairs are empty, and that's AFTER having already waited 38 minutes ! I WILL BE AVOIDING THIS PLACE AND RECOMMENDING THE SAME TO MY FRIENDS UNTILL MANAGEMENT AMELIORATES THE SERVICE AND WAIT TIMES!",1
"I was not impressed by this place at all. Extremely overpriced for the portion you receive. You pretty much are paying for the ambiance is all. The service was very slow considering they only had three tables in the entire restaurant. The presentation was nice, however, they at baby servings . I am still hungry",1
"I have been a member for several years. I don't understand why they can't invest iew equipment. I went to the Moon Valley location today, and it was 10 times better. Moon Valley has all new equipment and each machine has its own tv monitor. Paradise Valley is close to my house but I don't think I will be going to that one anymore.",1
"Im not sure how people call it clean! DIRTY! DISGUSTING! DIRTY! Small, dirty, hot, disgusting place! No AC, just a ceiling fan. The food is OK if you like grease! I ordered a steak quesadilla and the grease was running down my hands. The portions are huge, prices are low. Nevertheless, I will not go there again.",1
I must say this place is amazing. We were recommended this place from a local at Costco. Totally worth it. I had the fusion torta and my bf had the fusion chimichanga which were both to die for. On top of the food being bombdiggaty the prices were excellent! Super cheap! We will always pay this place a visit when we come back to Vegas!,2
"Great place. Found it on Yelp needing a quick bald fade having stopped in NV from SoCal on my way to NYC, and sure glad I did. Place was clean, comfortable, staff was super friendly and the guys really gave their time and attention to each client. A lot of detail go into these cuts, and it shows. Hard to find a quality barber. Highly recommended.",2
"Loved this place! What a unique place to grab a sandwich, best thing of all i don't have to talk to anyone about what I want on my sandwich. What I don't want blah blah blah. Just give them the bag for the sandwich you want, fill out the ingredients, pay. And bam! Sandwich no questions asked. If you are looking for a good sub place and are close by, better stop at wich wich",2
"since i travel a lot to rodeo drive, ferrari isn't a mind blowing sight, and yes i'm one of those idiots who actually pay 10 just to see ferrari from outside. my expectation was to see the interior of maserati and ferrari, turns out not. if its just exterior, i see it almost every day in my apartment's parking garage. mehhh",1
"I was fortunate enough to come here by attending a coworkers bridal shower and I absolutely love this restaurant. Food was delicious and the ambiance was amazing. The service was top notch and I can't wait to go again, possibly for date night! It is reasonably priced which is a great thing in this economy!",2
"Food drink were good tho our waitress seemed clueless as to the whereabouts of a wine list ""We have a lot of other wines, on a big list, somewhere! "" fortunately the house wine was fine . Inside is excruciatingly noisy, which some might find energetic, and outside one dodges wafts of cigarette smoke. Other than that, a decent meal.",2
"Took both of my cars there, went thru the drive thru wash and both vehicles now need to be detailed as the car wash left a bad residue on both vehicles. I called them and left a voice mail message and they still have not returned my call on what they are going to do about the residue or getting it off of my cars. I am seriously considering reporting them to the BBB",1
"This venue has been transformed into a very intimate concert hall. When we first arrived, we sat a whole section back from where we were supposed to be because we were a little lost, and I thought our seats were farther back than what they really were. I was pleased as peas when we sat in our correct seats and they were super close to the stage. Yay Britney!",2
"Best Thai in Vegas I think I love eating there as the atmosphere is lovely, especially outside. Their pannang curry is delicious as well as the chili mint noodles. n I live close to here, thai house and gallanga we have a hard time choosing! They just started a punch card which I think will sway our decision more often ",2
"Come hungry! Portions are huge, they will warn you and they offer friendly and fast service. nI had the infamous sage fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was nice, light crunch corn flakes , and the waffles were stuffed with full pieces of bacon. I really enjoyed the fried leeks, it really added a nice touch. nOverall we had a good experience, food was good and we were back on the road quickly.",2
One of the best steak places in town. So juicy that you do not need steak sauce. Good portions as well. Decor is nothing modern or fancy. It is quite rustic. Cheese bread is addicting. Service is hit or miss which is why they lose a star. But the food is pretty amazing for a place hidden away in the northwest.,2
"This place deserved a 2.5 star rating but that was not an option. nDespite the prior reviews, I was disappointed after eating here. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good. nWe had egg rolls which ended up being spring rolls , panang chicken and a shrimp dish. The shrimp were small Whig was overcompensated by the green beans. The curry dish was the best dish we had.",1
Id been here a few times and the service was always unprofessional texting and talking on the phone mostly . The performance of the technician is shotty but today takes the cake. The technician pull a huge chunk out of my eyebrow and then refused 2 admit it was her fault. She asked if I had a scar there and if i was sure. SUPER horrible! Will never go back!,1
"Upon check out I informed the assistant manager Luke the deli department doesn't have any price labels on any of their meats or cheeses. He was clueless, showing he has no clue what's going on inside his business. He didn't thank me for bringing this to his attention. Then he goes and overcharges me I come to find out after getting home. I'd recommend a new assistant manager for this location.",1
Their car museum is a rip off. I can't believe they charge admission. They only have 4 motorcycles and 12 cars. No info is displayed. They are parked close together and roped off so you can only see the front end. You can see so much more just standing on the strip for a few minutes. It's also dark and deserted in there very depressing. Sure wish I could get my money back.,1
Sweet Jesus this place is amazing! I'm thinking of moving to Pittsburgh from MA just so I can enjoy this place on the regular! nI had a caprese salad and duck prosciutto sandwich on a baguette. It was unbelievable! nAll the meats seem to be local and the cheese selection is stellar. nEat here! nBuy your meat here! I wish I had a way to transport meat home because the bacon looked beyond tasty.,2
"This was my first spray tan experience and I chose wisely! They were very professional and made me feel comfortable. I left the color choice in the experts hands and it turned out great! I had a question the following day, sent and email and received a quick response. My only issue was that although it is right on Indian School Road, the store front sign is small, I drove by twice. I will be back.",2
"Try the mr. Lucky's slot machine in the D terminal. It's my favorite slot machine. Its also my favorite airport because its in my favorite city. LAS VEGAS! Plenty of eating choices to choose from, lots of good people watching and plenty of places to rest your head if you are catching a flight on zero sleep Been there, done that! ",2
"The lighting is beautiful but they aren't eager to work with you unless you have a large budget. They charge 85 per hour for consulting unless you plan to spend more than 1,000 with them. For me, it was hard to determine my budget in advance of some planning. I ended up spending 3,000 on lighting but with another company that really valued my patronage over my pocketbook.",1
"Eh, I suppose I shouldn't expect too much out of a place called Whiskey Dicks. The only plus to this establishment was our waitress. I wish I knew her name. Boo me! She was very friendly and attended to our needs. We went during a happy hour where appetizers were half off. We ordered the chicken wings with the sauce on the side. Eh, oily but edible. Overall, a typical ""vegas "" local bar.",1
"On our way home to LA, we stopped by this store at 4 55 p.m. to pick up some foie gras. When we arrived, the store was dark and looked like it had been closed for quite some time despite its posted sign that they don't close until 5 00 p.m. We were so disappointed that the store would close so much earlier than it advertised and caused us to drive there for nothing.",1
"Mel Brooks once said the mystery of life is the Egg Cream. ""It has no cream and no egg! "" Well, maybe McAlpines does have some cream or at least whipped cream, maybe. I don't ask. I just enjoyably slurp. Wonderful service, good simple food, phenomenal atmosphere.and today, cherry pie. Long live McAlpines!",2
"I stumbled upon this place driving to Taco Bell and wow is it good. Some of the best Mexican food I've had in the valley possibly the best is served here. Its near my work so I come at least twice a week. Awesome food, great prices, friendly staff. The owner is always there and great at remembering people. Just try this place, you won't be disappointed PS. Try the cabeza tacos",2
The food was good but rather blah. Service however left a lot to be desired. We ordered 5 different appetizers to try the menu and had to ask for fresh plates with each serving and were never given clean utensils. We won't be back. The prosciutto though was awesome and we will going to the Deli to buy some.,1
"I can't believe where I stay. How they can keep that hotel in vegas, and why they said hotel, its really Motel. Room without any comments. Management you need really renovation immediately or go out of business. When you do check in before 3pm, they charge you 10.00 its not normally. Cheap Old Motel.",1
"I run a boarding facility for cute dogs and a few ugly ones and picked up a belated birthday cake for a client's dog named Lucy and let me tell you, that cake was gone in a matter of minutes the dogs enjoyed it so much! The people working at Woof Gang were extremely nice. Will definitely recommend them to everyone! Thanks again Woof Gang Bakery!",2
"Never pre order from there. I've done it and when I get there they either wrote the day wrong, or they crossed it out. They have gave away the donuts I ordered. so many different mistakes. The bad thing is that they don't have a variety for you to pick from when they do mess up. The donuts are good, too bad the service is not! Have not gone back after the fourth mess up!",1
"rental was cheap, but waiting for it! 45 minutes so far, friday night, getting to vegas, 3 clerks averaging more than 15 minutes each to check in customers. one took a break for a while. and as i stand here, it has now been 50 minutes, the other 2 working the counter had to take a break after checking in 2 customers.",1
"A previous reviewer mentioned Ihop and Denny's. Right on. Might as well mention LePeep and other bland, vanilla, overcrowded ""restaurants "" too. All I will say is this Until you've had a waitress dripping with sweat Dripping! deliver your food, you can't complain. So, I guess we CAN complain. Grow up.Go someplace real.",1
I have sent several clients to Louis as he helped them avoid BK. His out of the box thinking was amazing and I am happy to refer him business. I love that he explains to people that they should buy life insurance because their family needs it and that money caot be dispursed to creditors. He also works with amazing power partners that make him look good and help his clients.,2
"I just graduated after 4 years at CMU, and I can confidently say that Dave and Andy's ice cream is the only food I'll miss from Pittsburgh. They have many interesting flavors of the day, but cookies and cream is a solid staple that never disappoints. Whatever flavor you choose, make sure you get it in a waffle cone, you'll smell it the moment you walk through the door.",2
"Last 2 times we ordered pizza from this Domino's location the dough was sour, had a weird taste, and I got terribly sick from it. The wings were awful and tough. Never again. nWe found Bella Pizza a few weeks ago on Ellsworth Quadalupe, the freshpizza, dough is made from scratch, NY style, sauce is wonderful. You will love it!",1
"AwwwwwwMAZING! I could eat a dozen on my own! So bomb! I'm not a vegan, and these donuts don't taste odd, weird, or hippie. Wish I had some right now! Definitely take the drive to china town because its so worth it! Make sure you bring cash, no debit machine. PS 1 dozen donut holes for a buck! Yummy!",2
A Wonder smokey mesquite smell hits you as soon as you open the door and walk in. The price is right and the food is delicious. I've been here 5 times and had food catered once. If you're in the mood for Mexican food. This place is for you. With a large menu you have many choices. You owe it to your taste buds to stop here.,2
"This place is awesome A nice variety of slices, and of the 3 or 4 I tried, I'd say the 18b slice was my favorite. The crust has a great crunch to it, and the cheese and toppings are fantastic. As a local and a frequenter of downtown, I'm really excited that this place is here. Can't wait to see what's next for this place!",2
"Yummm. Love The Lady is A Scampi. it's all I ever seem to order from this place. Can't get myself to stray. HUGE shrimp, pasta i perfect and full of flavor. As for everything else. service was spot on, wait was only 30 minutes on a Friday night which is unheard of. One complaint. ordered a dirty martini and there was no olive garnish But if that's the only problem.we're in pretty good shape.",2
Good for half off drinks for happy hour! The sangrias are good. only got to try the white sparkling this is all tapas style food which i love cause it is perfect for sharing. the price was not bad at all. 10 or less most are below 7. Any place where they give complimentary seasoned garlic bread with yummy butter is a yes for me,2
"They are expensive, and rude and inexperienced customer service reps. The cable guys came out 7 times and still couldn't connect my cable from outside, finally the last guy said. ""oh we are not allowed to do that from the outside, you have to get a private company "".WTF! and they charged me for it, I called and siputed for months!",1
"Cozy atmosphere, good service and reasonable prices.what's not to like? We enjoyed the baked rigatoni with amazing bread and the green chili chicken with au gratin potatoes.yummy! This will definitely be a go to, neighborhood place on a cool day to enjoy some comfort food. I am excited to see the further changes they are going to make to the place. This is a definite must visit in Central Phoenix!",2
"Just had a great night there, had a birthday party for my daughter with 15 of us. Shuttle was great for all my guest that drove out for dinner. Ben had the area I requested all set up. Food was excellent and service was great. They had a good DJ too. I know in years past this place has had some issues. But Ben and his staff have really turned this place around. I highly recommend it!",2
"Went to listen to some live music. I was really, really impressed with Ruca. I stayed longer than I had planned because the band, Ruca, was so great. I was delightfully surprised at how good the food was! The service was great and our server was attentive and friendly. Our drinks were delicious and potent. I would definitely recommend!",2
"Yeah. They got rid of the 4.99 AYCE Salad Bar. Oh yes, it's still there, but now it's 7.99. No more discounts. And if I'm going to pay full price for a salad bar, I need a little more variety. It was fine at 5, not so much at 8. Considering that it was the primary redeeming factor about the place, that's a massive FAIL.",1
"Last resort to stay here, as it was the NCAA championship games weekend, so all the prices for the fancier hotels on the strip were extremely overpriced. This hotel is old. Our non smoking room still smells of cigarette smoke. No free breakfast, fridge or microwave. I've received better value at a Comfort Inn which includes the previous 3 items Pros really friendly staff.",1
"This was god awful. The chicken was fat with some skin and flavorless sauce. Somehow, they messed up the rice too. ""How is pork fried rice ever dry? "" said the boyfriend. It's making me want to vomit just thinking about how to describe the food. The crab puffs were decent. But, really, don't. Get Thai. No idea how this has such good reviews.",1
"Checkout experience is very poor. Never enough lanes open and I hate their policy of reading the customer's last name out loud when they give you the receipt. My last name is no one's business! Please stop doing this! Major privacy violation! On a positive note, the organic produce section is quite good and the only reason I shop here.",1
This is great medical office. The front office staff is friendly and professional. I have seen a few of the doctors and 1 of the PAs. All were very good. I like the flexibility of the hours and of being able to call and get a same day appointment. I have even taken my 3 yr old there because they provided the extended hours and we were able to avoid an ER visit. He was given excellent care.,2
"My husband I went to try Wahoo's as we were excited for a new restaurant to open! He ordered from sh tacos, I had some sort of smothered chicken burrito, we got a quesadilla for our daughter. The quesadilla was the best tasting food item we ordered. The food was bland my chicken tasted like canned chicken, just not very good. Oh well.",1
"the best place for rich men to take you on holiday. i mean, if you must stay in the states and can't get to new york. the best place really would be paris, don't you think? how come nobody's ever taken me to paris?! man, fuck the belagio. furthermore, fuck everyone i've ever dated. this review turned really bad really fast. excuse me while i go cry in the bathroom before my boss gets in.",2
Why bother with fast food when you can stop and enjoy your food? Breakfast is best but lunch and dinner aren't bad either. I'm a fan of the Ranch Chicken Sandwhich w fries for lunch and the Strawberry waffle they make it in a smiley face for breakfast. Just be forewarned that this place us super popular for breakfast on the weekends. However it's worth the wait.,2
"Hi, I visited bighorn casino iort las vegas and after 3 shoes in black jack i started to feel that somting is wrong. the ten card was mising all the time. after 10 shoes i was sure about that. I ask the menager to see the card i was alone on the table , and he say no. when i ask for a reason, he say ""because i say so "". I left with a bad feeling and not recommend going there.",1
Worst food experience I've had in long time.this is my first 1 star rating. Every dish we order was wrong or terrible. Almost half of the steak was fat and non edible. Just trying to hard.Over priced period! Stay away from this place. Better off going to place like Sakana or Yasu and pay fraction of the price for great food.,1
"I own a property management company in Phoenix and I use Scent from Above for all property move outs and move ins. I will summarize my satisfaction as follows I have never had a tenant call me at move in stating the property needs cleaning after Scent From Above has been there. Makes my job easier, I am very pleased!",2
Called for reservation with my groupon. Was told to call back lady was not in. But had plenty of rooms. I called back 30 minutes later and they have nothing now. Even spoke to mgr. it wasn't they were sold out. They just minimize how many rooms get groupon. We are locals to Arizona and did not find this service good.,1
"I travel a lot and had a fine experience here. Friendly staff and the bar was open as long as there were people. Also enjoyed the 24 hour access to gym. Didn't eat at the hotel, but the bar lounge area was a nice place to get work done in the evening. Lots of outlets are available. On the downside, my view from the room was of air conditioners.",2
Very delicious! Everything was very good. My favorite was the black dog burger with the Georgia peach BBQ sauce. The burnt ends were good but a pretty small app. The collard greens and sweet potato fries were my favorite sides. The applesauce and meatloaf special were overrated for me but my brother loved it! Order to go if you want to have a slightly less exhausting wait.,2
"The chocolate croissant the husband and I shared was one of the best I have ever had. and we ate it a day after buying it. The chocolate used in it was dark and flavorful in addition to being well spread throughout the pastry. The pastry itself was light and flaky. so good. At around 4 , the price was similar to any bakery. I would definitely get this again.",2
"Although the girl who helped us looked like she had a MAJOR tanning accident, she was sweet and knew what she was talking about. She was extremely attentive and didn't try to force any products onto us. She helped color match my mom and ended up doing all of her make up and it looked AMAZING! 4 star rating because they took a while to help us. They seemed very under staffed for a MAC store.",2
"Crust was great! We tried the garlic chicken and ceasar salad. Got a great deal on groupon, 20 ea for 2 visits for 18! We'll come back even if we didn't have the 2nd visit. Love the crust! Salad, I can pass. Only had croutons, Parmesan and light dressing. nCustomer service was good and friendly, especially on a Sunday 7pm!",2
"So I am out of town looking for a place to get a manicure. The sign on the door states that they are open until 7 30. I am there at 7pm. The woman tells me ""sorry, we closed "". I said that the sign stated that they were open for another 30 minutes. She just repeated what she said initially. I suggest they change their signage. I am going to take my business elsewhere.",1
"Amazing Space.The building is amazing in location and layout. Sadly a waste. Been here twice.everything I've had was either ""meh "" or just not good. I've had Disco Fries, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Peculiar Rabbit Burger, Their deviled eggs, and their version of lamb shwarma. Food is eh, Service is mediocre, Venue is great.but what are you to do.",1
"Two stars instead of one because its convenient and didn't have much expectation I mean it is at the treasure island!. But man ordered rare beef and it was over cooked, tough and dry! As for the soup, it tastes a bit better than adding salt to hot water I guess! I know there are good Vietnamese pho restaurants off the strip but I guess without a car, I just need to suck it up!",1
"Got mine to go, quick service. Spicy basil fried rice tasty but it had these star shaped carrots that I could've done without. Got number 3 medium spicy, and it was spicier than I expected but I loved it. Drunkeoodle also had these random star shaped carrots again. Otherwise it was great. Good portions. Tip Make sure they give you utensils and chili sauce if you order to go!",2
"I was looking for a new watch. but honestly, and more importantly, I was looking for a deal. After some negotiating, we came to an agreement. and they even suggested I have the watch shipped on their dime, of course to me in AZ so I could avoid paying NV sales tax. Overall, I felt very good about the price I paid for the timepiece and the experience.",2
"This place is a ripped off! They automaticaly put 18 tips on ur bill. The service was so slow, the waitress is so annoying, offering you drinks, if u dont want it, she will still ask ""its really good tho "". I dont care, its my money, why bother? Food was expensive too. Double price of regular thai out there. Dont want to come back for sure.",1
"Jesse is absolutely amazing! He has a masterful touch that is professional, gentle and yet extremely therapeutic. He is well versed in deep tissue and can find every single problem area I have with ease, working it out and making my muscles melt under his skilled hands. Thank you Jesse! Every time I am in Vegas, I will definitely be returning for another visit!",2
On Halloween 10 31 14 the servers employees tried to start a fight with people walking away from the bar for no reason at all. Screaming curse words and taking their shirts off. If this place is ran anything like its employed I highly recommend a new venue. Would not feel safe bringing my children here at all. Not family recommended.,1
Mediocre and I am being kind. Appetizer chips were burnt. My lobster salad had a lot of lobster but dressing was nothing to write home. Fish and chips had to go back. Batter was not done and when returned tasted to much of vinegar. Way to expensive. I will never go back to another Todd English place. I have tried them for years and the odds are that it is not good.,1
Another let down in Maricopa. The yogurt we had was bitter and gritty. We didn't like it at all. The majority of it went in the trash. So sad because we really wanted to be able to come here for our frozen yogurt fix. The place was decorated nicely and kept very clean. That's the only reason I'm giving it two stars but I know we won't be back.,1
"This business started in a dumpy little building South of the tracks. They survived by serving great food. As they have now moved to a much nicer location, their prices seem to have gone up but I am sure that it is because of the rent that they have to pay. I wish they had better combo meals. The staff seems well trained, and it is clean as far as I can tell.",2
The Pho here is INCREDIBLE! I now live in NJ and oh how I miss my 17 well done beef with meatballs . The veggies that they bring out with the soup are so fresh and yummy. The soup if flavorful and not greasy at all. The portion they serve you is huge but you'll finish the whole thing because it's so addictive. I'll be in AZ in about a month and this place is at the top of my list.,2
I had absolutely the worst experience I have ever had at a bar on the strip at blondies today. 11 4 14. The bar was busy and the restaurant was too and there was only one bartender. Being in a hurry to get the Britney Spears concert it made it impossible to get a drink before. Completely unacceptable for Vegas standards.,1
"I am a regular at this bagel shop. This is a family favorite for sure. I like that they have a great selection. The cheese bagels are the best around. Other favorites are Apple Crunch, Cranberry, and French Toast. nThe Hot Cocoa is good and there seems to be many coming in for the coffee. I can't speak for their sandwiches but they seem to be busy serving those as well. nStaff is always friendly.",2
"I would just like to say how impressed I am with the outstanding customer I received. Not only did the store fix the problem from the order the night before, they brought lunch for everyone. WOW. Thank you very much management team for your excellent communication and thanks Brandon for explaining what had happened the night before. Customer 4 Life!",2
"If I have a Thai food craving and don't feel like driving to Lotus of Siam, Archi's satisfies the craving. You're not gonna find out of this world dishes, but the kind of dishes that have become staples of Thai food found in America. Service is always prompt and attentive and it's speedy when you're ordering takeout.",2
"Well, here's the deal. It's hard to say which is the most driving factor in this review, the lackluster service, overly spicy, yet underflavored food, ridiculously tiny portions, disproportionately high pricing, or the monumentally long wait for the plate when we were the only ones in line. At least, when the tacos came out, the food was cold enough to mask the mediocrity.",1
"The buffet at the Bellagio has gone downhill in a big way. Had the weekend brunch here and the selection was not all that great and what was there was often cold and bland. Service was also not very good. I remember this place being so much better years ago when I first came here. For 25 head 30 if you want champagne , I expect a lot better selection and quality. Don't waste your money here.",1
"One thing that really irritates me is franchise locations that do not honor corporate coupons. If this place did not have such high prices I might not mind, but its like 10 for a large sandwich. Yikes. I might as well eat at a sit down restaurant at these prices. If you don't want to honor coupons then leave the chain. The food's not bad, but nothing special.",1
"Living in Laveen I want to support the local establishments. However, I would rather drive to Apache Junction then eat here again. The food is over priced mediocre at best. The employees all speak and act as though your in some bad gang movie, all the time touting there new renovations. The place still screams nasty dark truck stop, the Appelbees Corp needs to get a Handel on this ASAP.",1
"Overpriced Chinese food. The claypot with Seabass was AMAZING! The best part of our food experience was this dish. However, I also got a shredded pork with vegetables and an appetizer of Dimsum that was very good 4of5? . The meal was about 115 and we had two bottles of WATER. Overpriced for an okay experience. If it wasn't for the seabass in claypot meal, this would have been a complete waste.",1
"Nah.not quite on par with other interval international properties as far as the room and amenities but if you just need a place to crash with a kitchen, this will do nicely. Beds are visibly sunken in and ieed of replacement so sleep was rough. During off peak, you can get 7 nights for 229 . Can't beat that.",1
"Have only tried Happy Bellies delivery service once, but so far, so good! Everything worked as planned I called, I ordered food from a friendly, efficient and knowledgable operator, and the food was delivered to me in about an hour. Quality and variety of restaurant offerings rival those of Wheel Deliver.",2
We had a nice dinner out here and were really happy with everything. The homemade fettuccini was excellent and the pork loin was so well cooked and seasoned. We can't go back every weekend but once in a while this place is a really nice treat. The service was great and so were the drinks. Can't find anything that needs improving.,2
"I was craving sweets but wanted a bit of adventure, so these 3 deep fried Oreos covered in powdered sugar were PERFECT. First you taste the deep fried outer layer, followed by the melted Oreo cookie that lingers in your mouth. My only regret was not ordering a large glass of non fat milk. Guilty pleasure well worth it.",2
Bland. Over cooked noodles. Pricy. Snobby. Pretentious. We decided to eat here because I thought buffet was too expensive for vegan selection only I'm impatient to wait for an hour in the buffet line. What a mistake. The price came out about the same I was stuck with what I ordered. The soy bean was okay but it wasn't labeled organic so it was probably GMO soy. Disappointed.,1
"Came here for a team lunch based on some Yelp reviews, however, the meal I experience was below average. There wasn't much spices and most dishes tasted bland. I had to order additional plates of hot sauce, lemon, salt and pepper just to season the food. Perhaps, it was an off day for them, but I probably wouldn't make additional effort to go back.",1
This place was very good. I have been here a few times and plan on going back this weekend. Great place to pre drink before a Dbacks game. We enjoyed the first n chips which I have to believe was one of if not best I've had in Phoenix. Very fresh and flakey. Mmmmm.I can't wait till I come back for those!,2
"Even though this is a chain, I like the variety of coffee and the fact that they offer almond milk as a non dairy substitution I am allergic to both soy and dairy, so I can't find a coffee shop that offers anything else . Other reviews do mention big dog is around the corner and is better, but I must say for the coffee this place does give good competition!",2
"Rating is completely on customer service. Would've rated negative if possible, all the workers I saw looked like they hated working here. I understand it's not the most fun job in the world but I'm sure it isn't the worst. Recommend personality training, no sense of humor what so ever. My 2 brothers and I all said the same thing. Now as for the smoothies, they were decent.",1
"Best thing about eating lunch here is the patio seating. Special soft shell crab over mixed green salad was disapponting at best. Soft shell crab was over battered and lacked crab flavor. Salad was dull and lime vingrette seemed to be missing the lime. Chopped red onion totally overpowered. On prior visits, sweet potatoe fries are decent.",1
This is a real burger for ordinary people. You have to love the fact that they dont start cooking it until you purchase it. Its fresh and so are the toppings. It may be a small place but it seems to keep busy so I will be back. So much good food in Montreal and this is one of the places to stop when you are walking and visiting the city. J'adore mon Montreal. C'est Bon,2
Where does all night morning partying and drinking on an empty stomach get you? I'll tell you. It gets you up and ready to do it again the next day. Panda Express satisfied my craving for chow mein garlic shrimp honey walnut shrimp twice a day for the time I was in Vegas. SOOOO yummy and fueled my system so that I could drink more alcohol.,2
"I loved this show, its so beautiful, and there is really not a bad seat in the theater. nLike others have said, don't expect much acrobatics like other Cirque shows KA, Mystere, etc but DO expect gorgeous themed choreography stage decor to beatles songs a magnific! Minus 1 star because the show can be longer too many songs that are my favorites were not included in the show.",2
"The problem with the Great Dane Brewery lies in its sampler. If you're drinking only one brew at a time, you're not likely to notice this fault. I arrived excited by all the options so decided to try 8 samples of GD Beer. Each beer tasted watered now and strongly sour. This was very disappointing. A brewery should put its efforts into brewing quality beer, Great Dane does not.",1
"Pulled pork sandwich 2stars meat cold, not enough sauce nWing Sunday .50 5 stars no complaints nHot link 3 stars could tell good flavor but burnt and seemed like Sat leftover nBuffalo Fries 5 stars delicious nOverall 4 weird setup for refills and no access to BBQ sauces so 1st time have no idea what we'd like ",2
We went to sugar factory for brunch with our groupon! I recommended you getting it saves you soo much money. We had ricardo c. as our waiter he was so great and helpful! He is the real reason why I gave 5 stars. The breakfast was delightful and the Mai Thai goblet got me feeling good! Highly recommend. I think overall was a wonderful experience. Thank you Ricardo!,2
"This is the place to have fun in Vegas. Loosely ""Frisco "" themed Casino, has old time feel to it, but the go go girl dealers certainly lend to the party atmosphere. This is definitely not a kid friendly casino, they aren't even allowed in the shrimp cocktail snack bar area, so if you have kids, come back next time.",2
the burgers here are really good. Everything is made to order and comes to the table hot and fresh. They did some renovations to this location and that may explain their prices. The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the price. If you buy two combo meals the price will run you close to 30.,2
"Want to escape the throngs of people and escape to a simpler time. With wine. Then my friend this is the place for you. Such a small cozy restaurant, it has a great selection of plates to share and a pretty good happy hour. Don't forget to drop by on Wednesdays for open mic night with The talented Ms Sarah Chapman.",2
"Ordered chicken parmesan, noodles dry and not enough sauce, chicken burnt and lack of cheese is a joke. Ordered french onion soup and was given minestrone. Onion rings tasted nasty and the only edible thing was the salmon. Greeter on the phone needs to learn english as we had to repeat things multiple times, maybe she has adhd. McDonald's down the road has better quality.",1
"The Heart Attack Grill is fun. If you love kooky stuff like hospital gowns, sexy nurses, and crazy alarms, you'll be right at home here. The food here is EXTREMELY indulgent, but it all tastes great yes, even the butter chocolate shake . It's not gourmet, but it makes for a good vacation destination.",2
"Literally the worst place I've been to in Charlotte. Save your time and money. It took over AN HOUR to get our food from our Princess waitress. Like other reviews said, you get the impression that you are bothering the waitstaff. By far the worst waitstaff I've encountered. This place simply doesn't have ANY management oversight. If I could give it zero stars I would!",1
"As the name promises you can spend here a jolly evening with your friends either in summer in a lovely little treasure of a backyard court or on a cold day inside next to a heating fireplace. nCharming stuff which make you feel comfortable, great choice of Ales, and atmospheric interior. nWell done, Jolly Judge!",2
"I'll be short and sweet here, I love this place! Every time I need a last minute card or gift for someone, this place delivers! I've bought gifts for all kinds of people here too, they have great things for kids, drunks, odd balls, and lunatics and I suppose normal people too, but I don't associate with any of those types.",2
". hmm, yet another great Cirque. ODD This wasn't my wife's favorite show, but I thought it was pretty good. A lot of martial art type acrobats in which I could see could grab the attention of guys more than some of the other Cirques. The stage is huge and there are sections over the crowd that they perform on as well that makes you feel in the action. All in all, very good show.",2
"Overpriced mediocre food with unfriendly staff who has superiority complex. I have gone in 4 times and have promised myself not to waste my money on any of their food items except for their pastries. Even those are over priced. Cake the size of a small muffin for 7.95! I am sure no one has that kind of money, but I just talked myself out of going back to Essence since I can always go to LGO!",1
"Awesome food and excellent wait service. The waitress explained everything in detail. Scallops were cooked perfectly, best I have ever had. I was so excited to learn that they used buckwheat flour in some of the crepes, as I am gluten and wheat sensitive. This was our last night in Scottsdale for a group of 8 girlfriends, and this topped off the vacation with with an A .",2
I ordered a Turkey Ball pizza. It was horrible. It was cold. It didn't taste like pizza. I am not sure if I would order the pizza from Honey Salt. There take out is very disappointment . The food gets cold doesn't taste good while u are ready to pick up. I don't think I would order any take out at Honey Salt.,1
This place was awesome! We met a promoter at the casino in the hard rock hotel and he got us in free and gave us free drink tickets. The venue is beautiful and the music was great. There was a good mix of male and female on the dance floor. This is the best nightclub we've been to so far. Much better than Marquee.,2
"Awful! All products from true foods and restaurant depot per the ""chef "" . All bottom of the barrel. All frozen seafood again, per chef . Over breaded and drenched in ponzu to mask the poor quality. If you don't know your sushi you will leave unimpressed at the least. If you enjoy quality sushi, you will ask for your money back and leave hungry as we did. Skip it.",1
"First time at this location really disappointed. No other customers when we went in, so being busy not an excuse. Only one table was clean there was an employee sitting at it eating. On the floor next to her, half a sandwich. I even took a picture sent it to them. No response. If the place is thus dirty where the customers are, what does it look like where they prepare our food. Disgusted.",1
"I've been here twice now, once at their Scottsdale location and now their Tempe location. Although, it can get a little hot and humid at the Tempe location, I like it better, but I have had a great experience both times. I highly recommend the Salmon BLT. It's delicious! And if you like IPAs, I'd go with the 'Raj'.",2
"This is surprisingly really good. The employees were all very nice and attentive. My family and I ate at the teppan yaki table. The food was tasty starting with the salad and miso soup. The chef was experienced and entertained us. The only thing I wished they did was add chicken to the fried rice. It would have been more flavorful. Otherwise, I definitely recommend this place.",2
"Service was very very slow waitress not very friendly. I ordered Chicken Alfredo and was very disappointed. Served over ""macaroni ""! No garlic flavor at all. My husband had a steak that was more like shoe leather. Prices too high for the amount of food you get. Will not be going back to this restaurant",1
"I agree with the previous two reviewers. I've shown up here 5 times for breakfast after my 10 AM class around 10 53. every time except for once when they had a pretty reasonable employee, the people here have come up with some lame excuse to avoid making me a breakfast sub. Breakfast subs are available from 7 11 Silvermine next door is so much better.",1
"Great food, terrible service! We made a reservation for a graduation dinner and there were 10 of us. Our server had two other large parties and could not get out of her own way. As a previous server, I know this can be overwhelming, but we had to get up and ask to order our food and drinks and to have the table cleared all night.",1
"This place is horrible. Horrible food. Horrible service. I have come here twice because this place has such great reviews and both times have walked away confused because I have no clue what people like about this place. I guess see for yourself. I mean, after all some people love olive garden and that lobster place. This seems like the sushi equivalent.",1
"Great place for lunch. You can't beat the price, and the food is very tasty. For Chinese food it is pretty good. I didn't like the place a few years ago when it tried to add sushi among other things. Now with new owners and menu it seems to be just right. I now go there once a week or so to enjoy the savory lunch.",2
"This place really was excellent. I was there with a party of 7. Every person loved their meal. The service was amazing, staff friendly. Owner came by. We never needed anything. Food was amazing. When we arrived at 5 we were the second table, by the time we left the place was packed. I won't detail what we had. Everyone had a different meal and everything was incredible. I will be back.",2
"This is a good alternative for Postino's if a drive to Arcadia or central Phoenix is inconvenient. The happy hour was pretty good, all glasses of wine and sangria were only 5. The restaurant was very nice inside and our waiter was really pleasant and helpful. Like a lot of other people, I found their bruschetta comparable to Postinos very good!",2
"Ordered Wings and a Pizza. It took an hour and 45 minutes to deliver the driver did call to say that he was lost, but by the time he got here, the pizza and wings were cold. He didn't offer anything to make up for it reheated the pizza, threw out most of the wings and all of the fries too cold. Won't retry.",1
"Came up for the weekly Wednesday evening event to see how it is. There were several food trucks and a few stall vendors, although I did enjoy a big Cajun burrito from the ""Jamburrito "" truck I found the event overall to be kind of a disappointment. There was a guy playing guitar along with a soundtrack a fair number of people out for the event, but I thought it was weak overall. ",1
"Delicious! I was sold on the vanilla alone. I usually like to try other flavors but there vanilla custard was so creamy delicious I had to have a single scoop of that. I've heard the concrete is easily big enough for 2 people, but I'd say even 3 can share it. The service was excellent and this was a perfect topper to dinner. I'll definitely come back here!",2
My mother had two procedures done there this morning. Ultrasound and MRI. Staff was really nice but the Issue is that when we get there they spring a 640 co pay on her. They did not tell her ahead of time so someone who is already under immense stress. This caused her to panic about the procedure. I think that this should be on the check list of the pre registration.,1
If you're looking for a Taco Bell like meal this is it. Only more expensive nChili Rellanos greasy limp lacking flavor. nNo blended frozen Margariras.Rice cold and agaio flavor.gacamole same no flavor. nNot worth the nSkip this restaurant Scottsdale has many more restaurants with a lot more going for them.,1
"My hair stylist, Roger, just got a station at this salon! And while I will follow him anywhere, I will be torn if he ever leaves this salon! It's so clean and professional very accommodating and welcoming. Roger is also an amazing colorist, especially for blondes! He's fun and now he's at a location that matches his awesomeness!",2
I'm not 100 sold on Nami. They do the farmers market on Saturday they have this bad habit of parking their little Nami mobile on the sidewalk. Blocking the on ramp. Causing pedestrian and bicycles to have to go around them. It's a total disregard for anything and anyone else. I understand having to move around objects in the road. But not on a sidewalk.,1
Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. Taco. I think I ate that many. I cannot recall how we ended up here after an evening of redacted .nothing much. Stood in a line with a bunch of loud drunks. Our group split up to get a variety of eats from the different stations. 4th meal fun.,2
"I guess maybe because we were in a hurry to eat we tried here. The food is ok, certainly not bad I just didn't like it and it was super expensive. We got two appetizers and a milkshake and it was 44 without tip. I get that it's the strip but you can do wayyyy better for your dollar pretty much anywhere else.",1
"I had Marcus and he was so helpful from the very beginning! I was unsure about color as I'm bad at making decisions. He took his time making sure to listen to any specific requests squared off nails rather than rounded, nail length, etc . I was very pleased and the cost wasn't bad either! I'm def a new regular! Oh, and best perk, it's 24 7 so a last minute mani pedi is no problem at this salon!",2
Had just purchased 80 worth of wrist bands for the rides. Before I could get on a ride with my baby an unsupervised child pushed me baby out the way. Security was not concerned with me almost falling with a baby but more focused on a profanity that I said. Do not want to spend my money anywhere that isn't concerned about my child's safety.,1
"Fantastic cut by Cole! He was meticulous and really listened to what I wanted done as well as adding his own professional and stylish touches to make my hair look great. I appreciate the time he took to really give me the cut I wanted. He was also very friendly and easy to talk to. Great experience, I will definitely be back!",2
"I used to work at Sweet Tammy's and eat several of their baked goods per day. Some of my favorites lemon bars n CHALLAH.seriously, it's perfection. And after a few days it makes awesome French toast n snickerdoodles n coconut macaroons They also do a beautiful job on specialty cakes the bakery itself is beautiful inside. Check it out!",2
Not worth the money. Bad drinks and equally bad overpriced food. The pay roll was bland and possibly the worst I've ever had. It made the 35 roll taste even worse. The mongolian beef is better at P F Changs.Service was good. Decor was very nice. It takes alot for me to say these things about any place. Good luck.,1
"We tried Forefathers for the fist time last night, it was a very good experience. The staff was nice and helpful, the place was clean and comfortable, very casual. The side salad was fresh, the fries crispy, and they offer a bevy of free sweet bell pepper, cherry peppers, jalapenos, or fry sauce. Our household believes the best thing about the place were the cheese steaks, yummy and satisfying.",2
"Well, so sad, but I must write an update. nThe last two times I've been in, it was lame. I hope they aren't getting lackadaisical nsince they are busy the majority of the time. The girl that I had, kept burping and was leaning against the wall and then was falling asleep. OYE! Are you freaking kidding me? I might reconsider going back ",1
"Amazing restaurant and a must eat at place when in Las Vegas make sure you make a reservation. Possibly the best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to. We order from their vast menu of Izakaya style dishes and every dish is usually delicious. If you go, you must try their homemade tofu and juicy fried chicken. Be prepared for a long dinner though it's not somewhere to go if you are in a rush.",2
"Derald's is a popular fast food place and they do business from a small truck. They are located near Mathews Ave and Green St and another is at Mathews Ave and Springfield. Burgers are made to order and they are cheap.The fish burger only on Fridays is one of the best I have had but I don't think they use really fresh fish. It tastes really good with tartare sauce, onions and vinegar.",2
This Roberto's sucks compared to other locations. They charge ridiculous amounts extra for everything. If you want a carne asada burrito twice the size of this location go to the location on flamingo and rainbow. This is the last time I try this location. Bad attitudes and smaller portions is what you will find here.,1
"This review reflects only the check in nUsually we get a great experience at the Aria, as we come back every year. This year we were greated by a very unpleasant check in clerk. She was very cold and condescending. Luckily the supervisor Andy , was as always very pleasant and straightened out an issue we had with our buffet offer.",1
"Just wanted to put in a plug for their new food cart, on Johnson a little east of Mills. They have squash curry, mango pineapple curry, and a few sides. This is my new favorite food cart in Madison. Fast service, good prices, and the best curries in Madison aside from the brick and mortar locations .",2
"I hate this place. They burned the soy milk in my latte. Is that even possible? Plus, they're totally biting off of Angelina's in Paris and it's not even subtle. They lifted the font, the pinstripe and the color is maybe one shade off. I'll end this review with three words that I think sum it up nicely FIVE DOLLAR BANANAS",1
"fun funny place. really nice cool staff. part of the joke is they really do sell survival gear, weapons food. i'm not gonna buy my eyedrops here, but i did spend 98 on a legit hotel safe, stun gun 2 bumper stickers. i've always liked zombies, but i'm not going along w how very trendy they currently are. if i was a huge zombie fan, i'd give 5stars cuz as far as i know there's no store like this",2
"All right. The burgers are really good. Truffle fries nice touch, Hopdoddy. I approve. However, if the bar seating is full, I'm out. The whole 'Wait in a cafeteria line to order a 12.00 burger a la carte' concept just doesn't jive for me. It's awkward. Fortunately, it's a family establishment so there's usually room at the bar.or maybe it's just my drinking schedule.",2
"I feel a tad deceptive rating this place since we only had breakfast there but I would avoid this place at all costs. It had to be a new venue for them because nothing could be this bad and survive. Total chaos amongst the staff, dishes took way too long to appear before you and when they did, they were cold. Obviously, this place has never heard that breakfast is the most important meal.",1
I went for breakfast for steak and eggs and was very disappointed. The waiter was matter a fact and unfriendly like he was just going thru the motions. The busgirl gave me coffee with coffee grains in my coffee. The new Denny's downtown would have been a better choice as I ate there the night before and I g not more than what I paid for and the food and service was excellent.,1
"I was craving street tacos for lunch and Los Taquitos did not disappoint. I ordered the pollo street taco dinner. The tortillas are homemade, the chicken was marinated and cooked perfectly. I also enjoyed the tasty beans and rice. I would prefer to have someone take my order instead of standing in line, but otherwise had good experience.",2
"YUM. I tried the cannoli, lobster tail, crumb cake. To be honest the crumb cake was very very hard like a brick. But the others were very tasty. As for the line we only had to wait about 10 minutes. We came around 4pm on a Saturday, today. The workers were also very friendly and talkative so that was nice. ",2
"This is just for the casino. The Quad has improved quite a bit with their very open environment and friendly dealers. The dealertainers are still around and the place just looks a lot cleaner. You can find machine roulette tables from 3 minimum they let you bet 0.50 on black red, etc , just the total needs to add up to 3. You can still find blackjack and craps for 5 as long as it's not crowded .",2
"OMG! Talk about awesome and great food in an airport! Loved the French Toast, thick peppered bacon and sausage and the syrup was AWESOME! I don't usually rave about syrup but I found myself dipping every thing in it. My server was Mauren and she couldn't have been friendlier or quicker. Only thing I wish was they served my Diet Coke. But after that meal I can't complain.",2
This place is a dream come true to me. 12 bucks for unlimited amounts of everything on the menu. Obviously its not going to be the pinnacle of sushi but it's still tasty refreshing sushi. All the servers were very friendly and supportive of any egregious amount you want to order. Filling and satisfying. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this place.,2
I have been coming to this local for about 10 yrs. It's gone downhill. It stinks when you walk in. While standing there waiting to order . A roach came around the pizza continued across walk way and up the wall. We told the guy running the place. He came out and killed it with a towel. Loss my appetite for this place from now on. What a disappointment.,1
"I won free tickets to ONCE, which was my first time seeing a show at Gammage. We sat up high Tier B , but I still felt very much included in the performance. The building is beautiful from the outside, and charming on the inside. It was a little chilly at times, so I would suggest bringing a light sweater, but otherwise, I was very comfortable.",2
"Eh. The food did not come out as hot as I would have liked. I was able to see my table's plates stay stationary under the heating lamps. They somehow managed to botch up a margherita pizza. Other reviews have their pizza coming to the table burnt, our pizza seemed to be undercooked significantly. For the price, location, and all the hubbub about it, it wasn't that good. Return visit. nope.",1
The pharmacy here is great. First time I came here I was in and out within twenty minutes. This is my second time and it took a little bit longer but still not a big deal. I come all the way from tucson bc all tucson pharmacies never have nmeds in stock. So compared to tucson pharmacies this place is heaven. The Pharmacist who helped me was and Deb she was so kind and helpful.,2
"Cute place but what a rip off. 30 for a pedicure and my feet are still extremely dry and the ""massage "" that cost extra I could've done myself. I will not be returning here.customer service was terrible and the lady that did the pedicure was extremely rude and acted like she was way better then anyone on the planet.",1
"Have you ever tried to cancel your Cox Communication service via telephone! What a bunch of crap! After my wife and I called 4 different times with many different Cox employees, they still wouldn't cancel our service!.So I sent them a registered cancellation letter.DO YOU HEAR ME NOW! LOL Won't be back with them sooooooooooooon.yea right.",1
"Disappointed. The service was slow. Our drinks sat at the bar for at least 10 minutes before they were brought to the table. The food was okay, nothing special. Not sure we would go back. The atmosphere was cafeteria like and noisy. The only reason I rated two stars was because we had a Groupon, but not really worth the 42 for two people and two drinks!",1
"Great place for Italian. Definitely chose here rather than the location on State Street for a more intimate, less college heavy environment. I've been here with various boyfriends and every time was memorable.hey, I even remember their names! Highly recommended.check out the pesto. Up there with Portabella for best Italian downtown. 5 stars.",2
"Excellent tapas. Went with my wife, and were unexpectedly surprised with the quality of the food and service. The wait was a little long, but worth it in the end. Would definitely recommend, whether you're a local, or a tourist tired of the buffets and casinos. We were only two, so it was hard to sample everything but we will be back for more!",2
"I haven't been to this place in ten years, but I recently stayed here for a convention. This place has really fallen from grace. The service is horrible, the rooms are outdated and not very clean. The water pressure in my shower was low and the tub was backed up gross. Next time I have to go to a convention at the LVH, I'll stay elsewhere and take a cab to the convention.",1
"This place is open until 1am! We ate at the sushi bar and got the sushi sampler which was a fabulous choice. It was only about 30 to get a fantastic, fresh selection of a cut roll and sushi pieces. The drink menu looked amazing although I didn't try anything. The service was great and I would probably return here to get a sushi fix that doesn't kill my wallet in Vegas! More gambling money! ",2
"Not impressed with this place. The view was gorgeous but I've had better fajitas at chili's! The busser was on top of it, but the waiter was a little weird. The horchata was about the only thing that I can say was really good, which is sad because I've heard so many good things about this place. We probably won't be going back, if it wasn't for the ambiance.",1
Absolutely loved our food and the atmosphere. The service was amazing as well. Also loved fact they buy their food locally. I got the champion burger and it was the best burger I've ever had anywhere. The bacon jam is really a hidden treasure. We'll be coming back hopefully every weekend. Thanks welcome diner for providing an awesome experience.,2
Stayed here last year in November! We stayed a week and everything was great! The bed was super comfortable and clean. The room had two bathrooms and a kitchen. We had view of the strip which was really nice at night. Our tower also had Starbucks downstairs which was great. I did not mind the walk to the strip since i enjoy walking everywhere. I would stay here again!,2
Dr Philips is a great doctor. He takes time to explain everything. He will also explain in simple terms so children understand. He is getting set up in this location from his old 85226 address. Not as fancy. I'm more concerned about a doctor's ability versus the carpet color. I would highly recommend Dr. Philips. He is a conservative doctor with spot on accuracy to diagnosis.,2
"I usually stop by here between the hours of 1am 3am due to my work schedule the guy who I always see will not only take my order at the speaker, but will also repeat it to me at the window, but wrong so don't bother even ordering at the speaker. Also they conveniently only take cash during the hours I visit. Pretty weird.",1
"Cheap, tasty noodle concoctions are served up in decent sized portions in this apparently national chain. With most everything available vegetarian, the low prices and friendly service at this little strip mall establishment made my lunch memorable. When will Noodles Company come to California, where I live?",2
"Wow, these cupcakes are dry, dry, dry! Time and time again, they are consistently dry. Clearly they need to drown the things in frosting, or they would not be edible. If you have a big bite of frosting with a tiny amount of cake, it is ok. But sad to say, the regular grocery store provides much better quality. I'd save the money and go for dessert elsewhere.",1
"While staying at the Monte Carlo on a recent work trip my group ate here twice! Definitely touristy but the steak and fish tacos are sooo good. I was even craving them after I returned home. The guacamole and their salsa was very tasty as well. We split a pitcher of regular margaritas on the rocks, which I thought was a perfect mix of tequila lime mix.",2
"Not their best showing. Waitress left a LOT to be desired. Had to ask for a 2nd beer two times and never got it. Asked for bread 3 times. No go! Medium steaks are apparently red and mushy in the middle. Don't ask for a deviation from the menu, won't happen. All told, very disappointed. I'll give it or more shot, MAYBE, but would never recommend it based on this trip. Sorry.",1
"We ordered a cake for my son's 10th Birthday. It was not your typical cake, it was a twisting Rubiks Cube. The cake was done perfectly and a huge hit. It was stable, the cake was moist and everyone just loved it! Even the staff at Amazing Jake's all came to check it out. Thank you so much for making his 10th Birthday even more awesome !",2
"I love this place. No words can describe how much I love In N Out and wish there was one in Chicago. Every time I am anywhere near an In N Out, I always make a stop. Sometimes I make a stop 2 days in a row. IT's that much of an addiction. Everything here is fresh, the fries are real potatoes that you can see being cut and it tastes so much better. Yum.",2
"Add to the list of ""what makes winco different "" that they don't take credit cards. Unfortunately they don't make this abundantly clear in the store. Hopefully you'll read this review before you embarrass yourself in the store in front of a line of shoppers like me. Humiliated. 1st visit. Last visit.",1
I am sitting here as I type this. I finally got a beer after 8 minutes of sitting at the bar they are NOT busy. I waited another bunch of minutes to get bartender to take my food order . A whole bunch of employees just talking to one another. Wish I left instead of torturing myself with this social experiment. Spend you money somewhere else. I will say the food was very good.,1
Two stars. Thats for a few reasons nCan't get out in the parking lot without getting hit up for 'gas money' by people who are on bikes nDirtier than almost any other Circle K I've ever been to. I'm from Arizona and they are as common as cactus. nTheir soda fountain sucks. I drink a ton of diet coke every day and they have the worst soda fountain I've been to. Not closed.,1
"This location can't seem to get anything about my drink correct. I order from Starbucks stores across Illinois, as I travel often with my job, I get the same drink everyday for the same price at each location. Except this one. Charge wrong ,make the drink, wrong with attitude . Never returning to this location. Good thing others aren't this rude.",1
"Went here with a friend and had a fabulous experience! My friend got a pedicure the deluxe, which included hot stone massages, sugar rubs, etc. and I got a manicure. The host owner was extremely attentive, welcoming, and ensured that we had a positive experience from beginning to end. We both loved our services and we'll definitely be coming back soon.",2
"This place is awesome. went there super hung over from an epic night and the food is perfect. Awesome breakfast potatoes, bagel sandwiches with egg, cheese, and whatever meat you want. They have it all. Its close to the strip. Not a ritzy place at all the ATM gives you a receipt and you have to get your cash at the front desk!? Price is legit though you can have a full breakfast for 10 easily",2
"I was totally impressed with this place! It is super clean, tons of machines, several change machines, and even games to keep the kiddos busy. The woman working didn't catch her name put all of my clothes in the dryer for me, so that was awesome. I saved so much time and was able to get some errands done! I would recommend this place to anyone who needs to use a laundromat once or every week!",2
"A plethora of brown liquors including those of the high end and hard to find variety are showcased at this shipping container turned rustic hip drinkery. Place your spirited requests and trust in the very capable hands of what I would call THE up and coming dream team of bartender mixologists, all of whom treat their craft as an art.",2
"Delish, had flat noodles w shrimp spicy, Mmm mmm. I mentioned to server that it was my first time she was very helpful and friendly she ask what I'd like noodles or rice. Then point out plates with noodles. I devoured the noodles before even thinking of taking a pic. I will definitely recommend. And be back to try the curry.",2
"Horrible Service. Felt unwelcome as soon as I came in. Their open sign was ""on "" but when I walked in the owner was using the restaurant as a meeting space for some type of large group. They were bugged I came in and told me I couldn't eat inside, and that i'd have to eat on the patio. Food isn't that good either. Rice and Meat were all extremely dry.",1
"I stayed at Luxor just for a girls weekend trip and of course we ended up at Pyramid Cafe after a long night out. The food was awful, I would rather have eaten a top ramen in my room. The pancakes were so tough and chewy and the bacon was bland.how does that happen? If I ever stay at Luxor again, I'm bringing in snacks for late nights or going to the Denny's down the street.",1
"I have to say that about 6 months ago I would have never gone to sprouts but, a change in life happened to my family my 6 year old daughter was diagnosed with selac's Disease allergic to gluten or wheat . Sprouts saved our life they have the best selection of gluten free products and at a good price. I would highly recommend them as the best store for gluten free products.",2
"I was very excited when the Brentwood opened because it is stumbling distance from my house, but after my experience here I won't be back. We sat in the bar area for 10 minutes and were never spoken to. I'm not sure if it's because we weren't gambling or what? But after 10 minutes of no service we timed it , we left. Big disappointment.",1
"It's never a good sign when the side dishes are better then the steaks at a steakhouse. The sweet corn was excellent. Got the filet and it was really tough. Had trouble cutting the steak and it was really chewy. When you drop , the meat should melt in your mouth and cut like butter. Good ambiance and service, but I've had better steaks at Diners.",1
"Known for fries and cole slaw on huge sandwiches. Not a big fan of the slaw, so I usually take some of it off the sandwich. They are extremely filling so I usually take half of mine home. The chili is good and the Smallman Street Fries are great. Family pizza night on Tues. Thurs. better than average pizza. Although known as a sports' bar, Ptrimanti's is definitely ""family friendly, """,2
"They did an exceptional job. My car went in completely filthy and came out virtually spotless and shiny. I was impressed. So, why only one star? They stole all of my change that was in the cup holders. Granted, there was only probably 5 total but still a very shitty thing to do. Not coming back. If you decide to go here, hide yo money.",1
"This place is a slice out of the late 80's early 90's themed restaurant era. We're talking Rainforest Cafe, after the forest was depleted of it's trees. Food was about as 'normal' as you can get. Simple. Don't expect Vegas quality food here. Important Note I ate in the restaurant part, the bar was hoping ",1
"Preston Crandell has treated multiple homes for me for pests and for termites. The service was always on time, on budget and effective. I always chose to work with locally owned businesses when possible and have been a long time fan of this company. If you need service, do yourself a favor and call Crandell Pest Control",2
"I am reviewing about the lunch it was really good! and its also 9 dollars, which makes it really affordable! each entree comes with a salad and rice. the salad was very good, with cornflakes instead of croutons. I had the crab cakes, which did not compare to maryland crab cakes but it was still pretty good.but it was still pretty nice. The fish lunch special was not too great however.",2
"I enjoy the atmosphere and love the huge selection. I'm not giving 5 stars because of the food menu. They just changed it and got rid of all my fave items. Basically it seems all they really offer now are burgers. While that's great for some, I prefer a little more selection. This won't stop me from coming in!",2
"Service slow, food not very good, waiter rude, had to ask busboy for food, and drinks. When bill came, waiter very argumentive because we gave the tip to the busboy, not him. Owner then got into a argument with our host who paid the bill. Our host had been there a few years earlier, but now will never go back.",1
"Great place for grilling pork belly. They will grill pork belly gimchee and bean sprouts on the hot grill right on the table for you. If you don't like that, they have bulgogi and spicy chicken. After half way through, they can stir fry everything left along with rice. It's like another meal. But my favorite there is gimchee stew. Yum",2
"This place is lame, overpriced, and not worth the stop! 12 bucks for a vodka soda? Puhlease! I know u pay more being on the strip but geez, give me something worth my time and . Young girls, and I'm talking 21 yr olds, inexperienced boys, no real dress code and the layout sucks! Never going back ever! Rude staff!",1
"Trivia night at Duke's is one of the highlights of my week. It's a great excuse to hang out at Duke's and eat some of their great food. They have quite the menu and I always have a tough time choosing what to get. I typically go with the sandwich and soup combo, but the salads are awesome too. Service is hit or miss, but not bad enough to keep me from coming back every week for trivia night ",2
"the yogurt is actually good, my problem is with the staff a bunch of kids that don't know crap, cant make change and where the hell is the manager does the company know what a manager is or are they afraid to pay more than minimum wage? get real, get real employees and the do not accept bills larger than 20 it's a joke I spent almost 40.00 and would not accept a 50 dollar bill",1
Overpriced and not at all comfortable. hard chairs and laminate tables We tried the buffalo and the angus. It gets two stars because I am a burger and hot dog aficionado. Nothin special about this place. Even the sweet potato fries and chips were ho hum. And what's in that stringy sticky dippin sauce?,1
Was in Vegas again and my group of friends all wanted to go to Tryst on after going to Moon Friday night. Chris hooked everything up and got the guys in free at Tryst! We had a great time at both clubs and it was all thanks to Chris as usual. Go to their website and get the same hookup I always do. for FREE! Vince,2
"I've only used the conference room facilities at this location and I have to say it's not that impressive. The rooms are stuffy and humid, and it seems over all hard to properly control the temperature. Coffee that is being offered during conferences is pretty bad too. I can't say much about the hotel rooms.",1
"I this is your idea of good BBQ, you obviously don't know anything about what good BBQ should taste like. I saw one review that suggested you eat the meat with the sides looking for flavor I guess. Lame attempt at sauce, ho hum buns. I think the only reason they've lasted is that this town doesn't seem to have much competition in the BBQ department.",1
"Went back a second time, I found the the steak and scallop hibashi awful, plus again with the boiled frozen carrots only this time it was a bowlful on top of the rice. Just terrible. The Japanese onion soup that came with the measl was the only good thing about it. The waiter really tried to please but there's nothing he can do other than finding another restaurant to work at.",1
"Took the family from Tucson, and we are all very picky when it comes to Mexican food. It's hard when you're Mexican and come from a family of Mexican restaurant owners. Red sauce no bueno Carne asada bomb Salsa good Beans good Rice ok Tortillas bomb Carnitas eh.kinda dry All in all, we will return. Staff was super friendly and on their game!",2
"Its hard to eat light in Vegas. Believe it or not the buffets are some of the best options for eating light. Lot's of sushi, veggie,s fish, shrimp. You can go heavy on the sauce or none at all. I think Bacchanal is a little over priced during lunch but in general buffets aren't my thing. I'm io hurry to go back but I would happily go there again if the people I was with wanted to.",2
"Ordered a chocolate banana crepe thinking its pretty hard to screw that up you know, but they found a way. It was cold, dry, and just very badly executed. The service was also not the best, never came by to see how it was or even refill our drinks. Safe to say I would not recommend this place to a friend.",1
"A fun adult variety act show with a atmosphere of a "" Tim Burton "" French circus twisted dream. The comedy is edgy and fun. The performers were all extremely athletic and talented. nWhat makes this show really exciting is the intimit nature of the circus tent. It is a really small tent so it feels like the performers could slip at any moment and land on your lap.",2
"The only good thing I witnessed here was the fact that my food they brought out to me they were out on the line was hot and the young girl who rung me out was very nice. The bathroom almost made me hurl and the floors furniture was dirty. If you visit this one, use the bathroom before you go and bring hand sanitizer!",1
Yay! I've finally found a decent Vietnamese restaurant in North Scottsdale. I had the PHO customized the way I like it and a sandwich. Both were really good! Very reasonably price and the service couldn't be faster. I just wish they had a bigger menu but they have the basics so I will be back for sure!,2
"everyone says sonic has the best drinks.and everytime i go, i always end up thinking.what a bs! nwe were on the way home and hungry. i ordered chicago dog and peach ice tea. ok so as far as chicago dog goes.meh all i have to say. jalapenos was the best thing about this! npeach ice tea.go to jack in the box and order one from there. 10 times better!",1
"I hate to do this but I can't say I'd recommend this place. I've been there a couple of times and the experiences were similar. The food is mediocre and a bit high on the pricing. There is a lot of room for improvement on the service side inexperienced, not trained, and painstakenly disorganized and slow service albeit the staff were friendly.",1
"The worst Thai food I've ever had! This place was recommended to us by another couple, and wow was I disappointed! Everything was completely blase and tasteless, the only exception being the extreme spiciness of my fiance's entree probably to make up for the lack of other spices . don't bother with this place.",1
"Perhaps a good place for a drink, but the food was positively dreadful even by airport food standards. Split chicken fingers and fries with my son. Food was dry and bland. I found the server to be borderline rude despite the place being empty. Prices were really high although you have to expect that at an airport. Wish I would have walked a little further to a more local establishment.",1
"Twice I found scratch marks on my dog here. I think there's lack of supervision. From the window inside, it's pretty small and if they have a lot of dogs, they seem not to have any area to play. I wouldn't recommend grooming from what I've read or seen at the daycare. It's very low budget. I'll keep this place as a back up, not my first choice.",1
"This very good and inexpensive mexican food. They have excellent tamales, the green corn tamales are good plain or with chicken. The shredded beef with green sauce on frybread is superb, as is the frybread dessert with honey and powdered sugar. The one main issue with El Bravo is the consistently spotty service, but the food is consistently top notch if you can put up with the service.",2
I cant believe it took me along to give Cidermill a review. I order lunch delivery from Cider Mill at least once a week. I have tried many things on the menu and never felt dissappointed. The quaility of the food is so fresh and well thought out. I highly recommend the Nay's Milly Philly Or Tom's Tuna with the bread toasted,2
"We have been here 4 times in the last few months. Each time the food and service are great and the prices are reasonable. We have tried various things on the menu, appetizers, salads and steaks. Everything has been really good. They consistently refill drinks, clear dirty plates and are friendly and welcoming. We will continue to visit Texas Roadhouse!",2
"Got some good memories at this place good place,good food and nice people. But i really wonder why they did not get more creative for naming the place and just called it the thai place. This review of mine is going to end now. Short and sweet hmmm.sweet.hmm.Panang curry sounds good ,and so does that tofu with peanut butter sauce or the pad thai.ok! i am stopping Smriti ",2
"Chino is one of those places that does not have amazing mexican or asian food but they have manged to make the fusion of the two work. The jade red chicken and jerk chicken are two of my favorites and the chili rellano is serviceable. I think i will stay away though because about an hour after eating my wife got really sick, not blaming the food but i would rather not take any chances.",1
"Margaritas were made with store bought margarita mix. The chips were not fresh and they were out of a bag. There was no free chips salsa refills. I ordered a chicken and cheese quesadilla, and it came out with only cheese and tasted very bland. Service was not only poor, but they were not pleasant. By far he worst ""Mexican "" restaurant I've ever been to, and I will not return.",1
"The worst hooters I ever ate. Wings were over cooked, I was sick the next day from what I ate. Just was not GOOD, the place is dirty and smells of rotten, moldy smoke. However, our waitress was superb, that's the reason for 2 stars. The hooters at Sunset Station and the others around the valley are much more appetizing.",1
There isn't anything I don't like about Bandera! The artichokes are fabulous. The Dip Duo Queso is like heaven in your mouth. Prime Rib is exquisite. I have never had a bad meal here and I've been coming for the last 15 years. From start to finish Bandera is a fantastic place to eat. Get the Banana Cream pie for desert. So yummy.,2
"I didn't like On The Border the first few times I tried it a few years ago. I tried it recently in Charlotte and it was delicious. I think they changed something about their salsa, it's extra hot and so good now. Their chicken enchiladas are great with the cilantro lime rice. But the shrimp fajitas are where it's at!",2
"This is MY Fry's! I love this place. It's almost exactly one mile from my house, well stocked, clean, friendly, and I can get in and out fast when time is short. I also have found some great deals on household items on the marketplace side. The fact that I end up with weekly discounts usually .10 cents on gas is just the cherry on top.",2
"The coffee here is not bad. However, the service was terrible. The barista rolled her eyes at us when we ordered an extra drink and never once smiled. She didn't greet us when we came in even though we were the only people in there. She just said, what do you want?. We were going to order food but decided not to after her attitude. The art work is cool and they have a big outdoor area.",1
I was so disappointed. I ate the entree of cheese raviolis whereas my boyfriend had the mushroom pizza. Everything was so watery and sour believe it or not . The tomato sauce was unenjoyable because it had such a bitter after taste. Every time you went to pick up a slice of pizza it would disintegrate and fall apart. I wouldn't go back. Honestly.,1
My husband and I were told to go their from a local gal. We both got the Jumbo sandwich with chopped brisket on one side and pulled pork on the other. The sandwich was amazing we will be back. Next time I would get all Brisket. Loved the homemade root beer. Prices are reasonable and the cheese potatoes and mac cheese were great.,2
"This is my favorite all your can eat sushi place in Vegas! You can always find a seat right off the bat Which is a far cry from somewhere else Yama Sushi where I have waited up to 2 hours with a group of 6 . The menu is much longer, and more unique than somewhere like Sushi Mon. The decor is pretty hip, staff very friendly. We go back at least once a month!",2
Been here a few times. Close to the house. Not bad for this part of town. Nice pleasant atmosphere inside. Service is good. You can peek through the serving window and see them making the food. I had the Tom Yum soup extra Thai spicy and it cleared up my stuffed up head within minutes. Great flavors. Simply Yummy!,2
Westgate took over. Beware of timeshare sales. The hotel is undergoing major renovations. Room was without cable for day and a half. Service guy had great attitude. Trying his best. Stay here on a deal. Casino under Hilton and LVH used to pay well. Now slots are tighter. Word to wise to Westgate don't ruin what used to be a great hotel.,1
"Went there today. very pleasant experience! I'm a female, and it wasn't the least bit sketchy. There are little individual rooms with soothing piped in music. My masseuse was very sweet and often asked how the pressure was. And at only 19 for half an hour, it was a steal. granted, maybe that's standard for Vegas, but I live in New York City. ",2
"Ate here for lunch yesterday. Despite the fact that there was only one additional party seated in our area, the server failed to get our drinks in a timely manner and remained inattentive. Didn't feel like I received a great value for the price. The shrimp cocktail was 18 and consisted of three large shrimp! Three? Really? Not impressed.",1
"While this place does offer day care, is spacious, has the classes, everything else it could be cleaner. Its in a very nice area of Phoenix so I'd expect the expectations to be a bit higher. The place for the most part seemed clean but they could've done better. The day I went was stuffy and warm, wth you have a bunch of people working out and creating so much heat",1
Was in vegas looking for something to eat on the strip. Walked into Planet Hollywood and saw this Brazilian Steakhouse. Well it wasn't what I expected at all. We got a half price discount for buying two meals. The meats tasted like something you would find at an average buffet. If you like buffet food come here. If not stay away.,1
"Union Pig Chicken has some of the best BBQ that I've found in Pittsburgh. The brisket is soft and falls apart with a fork, although some of the pieces can be overly fatty. Every time I've been the service has been decent, but slow. Union is also a surprsingly good place to go for lunch, The sandwiches they serve are delicious. One last note, definitely get the mac cheese. It's that good.",2
I had canceled my membership 3 months ago and found out I was still being charged. nI was refunded but still it sucked that I was being charged and was told by a staff member they would take care of it. They didnt but owner did cut me check for it right there. I'm still going 2 bank 2 make sure payment will stop deducting. Just a lot of work 2 cover your but.,1
"I have visited this location of Chipotle on a few occasions recently and each time I go there I am really impressed and enjoy my food.I have had the chicken burrito and also the steak burrito which are both excellent.The prices are also really good and I feel it is very good value for your dollars,I will continue to visit this Chipotle for sure in the future! Highly recommend.",2
"Well I was searching for a good coffee shop since Starbucks now resembles a bus station and never has a coffee smell anymore. Great coffee, french press offered, real cups, teas, french pastries, sandwiches and great soups. Two stories and smells like coffee. A bit ""trendy "" for me but worth the trade to have such good snacks and great coffee. Espresso curled my hair great!",2
"My cousin treated a friend and me to this place, and I'm so glad he did! This is a novel little concept I love ""different "" and the food is really good. I had a lamb burger, which was AMAZING! This place has a great ambiance. not too romantic, not ""fast foody "". If I lived in Charlotte, This might be the go to spot for my crew because they definitely have something for everyone.",2
"For dinner I was quite pleased with my entree and Naan. Spice level was exactly as specified, all food was rather good and served hot. I thought the food was clearly superior to Indian Oveearby. Friendly service. Building doesn't look so great on the outside in this strip mall but it's ok inside. Draft beers available.",2
"My car died a mile from the rental return, and instead of helping me make my flight, they wanted me to wait hours for their roadside assistance. Then they charged me 200 to tow the car without sending me a receipt or any documentation. Bad cars, bad service all to save a buck or two. Go someplace else or be prepared to get ripped off.",1
Took in a 1997 Specialized that had fallen into severe disrepair. Was seeking to rebuild it so a young friend could learn to mountain bike at low start up costs. The tech did an excellent job what repairs were required to insure it could safely be ridden. The repairs were done quickly and exactly on budget. The bike looks and rides great. Thanks for a job well done!,2
"OMG the food was absolutely amazing. We came here today for a noon lunch. I got the special which was an omelette made with Bacon, Turkey, and Mozzarella Cheese with a side of potatoes. I ate the whole freaking thing with no remorse. Good service and amazing view of the golf course. Highly recommended!",2
"After two other locations near me shut down, I was forced to start frequenting this one. Dunkin' Donuts has been a staple in my family since I was kid and I cant get enough of their munchkins! The service here is superb! I have never had any issues with any of the employees. The food is always great and they make my coffee just right!",2
"Visited Carvers Steaks and Chops on Monday night for the first time. YUMMIE! Service was excellent, thank you Bernice and the Steak melts in your mouth! The Calamari is delicious, seriously this was a treat. You Eat with your Eyes and when the food arrived it is a visual delight. Brilliant color, aroma and such flavor. John, Leigha and myself give this a WOOHOO! Thank you Todd Cunningham you ROCK!",2
"Love the beer selection for happy hours here. The service is always great, and the vegan selection is great! Their menu lays out what is vegan, and they also have many substitutes like vegan cheese and sour cream. My only complaint is how dark and loud it is. Being in the heart of a college town, I wouldn't expect anything else, but still always a great experience.",2
"It's cheap, fresh, and delicious! Far as Mexican, fast food goes I perfer this place over Chipotle and Baja Fresh. Their guacamole is actually guacamole and is really yummy. most places it's some green stuff not something I want to eat. The chips are better then other places as well in my opinion. I really think far as chain food restaurants go this one needs to be around more areas of town!",2
"Terrible food. Terrible service. The absolute worst. We stopped here for lunch and should have gone next door to Fajitas. The food was both greasy and dry I'm not sure how that was accomplished . There was only one waitress at the end of the lunch hour. She was nice, but could not keep up with serving the entire restaurant.",1
I was with shana w for this disaster of a visit. How can any place tell you to go away when they are still open? It wasnt like we were going to have a full dinner.just wanted a drink and maybe some soup. Mind you there were at least 4 other people at the bar we were so rudely dealt with. I cant imagine how a corporate restaurant could possibly have this policy.,1
"there's so much wrong with the service in this place. Sometimes you get a good cut, sometimes you don't. If you ask for a shave, you'll probably get hot lather and disposable razor raking across your face. I know from experience. I won't do that again. I gave this place enough chances. The older lady that doesn't speak any english is getting better at cutting hair though.",1
"The decor is fantastic. The service is average. But the food is just not worth it. My friend had the herbal chicken ramen, and could not even finish the bowl. I had the cold noodle salad. I LOVE cold noodle dishes, but the noodles were over cooked and soggy. I had high hopes for this place, but the food we had was just outright gross.",1
"Like fellow reviewers, I've never eaten Nepali food outside of here and its sister restaurant Chautara, I've had several amazing meals here. Simple fresh food in the traditionally laid back State Street atmosphere. Everything I have had was good here. Great for vegetarians and those seeking a unique ethnic fod experience.",2
"Stopped in here for lunch today joined by Norm R., Arlin B., Robyn N. Mike C. I had a Torta Mexicana for this first visit I thought it was just great. right up there in the same range as the two locations each of Los Reyes de la Torta Tortas Paquime that I have tried. You get a small salad or potato chips with it a tasty roasted Jalape u00f1o Pepper. Borderline 5 Stars! Torta Mexicana 6.50",2
"Yikes! This is my first and last time here. It's obvious that no one has put a dime into this esstablishment in years. Everything down to the chairs and bar counter are old and worn. I can't comment on the food, but the bar selection seems decent although I'm sipping on an awful pinot noir at the moment. I will not be returning. 1 star for cost n1 star for being located in the Steel Building",1
"I have been in this place several times and have had mixed experience. The service here is not so great. I had a question about a video game for my nephew and I felt like I was putting the clerk off by asking questions. The store was a bit disorganized, but I would expect that for a Saturday afternoon.",1
"Had the best time of my life till the checkout. The staff stole from our lockers, if Porscha is collecting your belongings then say goodbye to your stuff. Shirt, keys, wallets were taken. Told us to go lost and found which is just diverting the situation. Nothing got done. 3 months later and no resolution. Go somewhere and avoid this disaster.",1
Great food and friendly service. nLoved the appetizers and shared several main dishes family style. Try a few dishes and take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. We have been there with friends several times and have never been disappointed. Go a little early or late for lunch or dinner for immediate seating.,2
"We order these breakfast burritos to the office ALL THE TIME ! They are the best in town ! I'm not normally a breakfast eater but I sure eat these ! Flavorful , good soft crispy thin flour tortillas , excellent salsa . And the delivery guy is always nice and smiley. They're all good but my fav is the Max Bacon . Mmmm mmmmm good !",2
"The service is friendly, and the staff are very cool, but come on people. It's cheap because it's gross. I really respect the Y and what it does, but I loathe the food. I tried it multiple times to see if it was a fluke, but it was hideous. The stuff s obviously microwaved and low quality. And just.ICK. HORRIBLE. I'm going to call it the Y Bother?",1
After 10 years I left wf. I opened acct with a branch on the west side. I was trying resolve the issue at this location and the rep insisted I back go to other branch to fix the problem because it was their mistake. I'm a wf cust I would think any location can help. I just closed all my accts and never went back.,1
Way over priced for sushi that aint good taste all the same .i order 4 rolls and a chicken Teriyaki.dinner and the chicken was dry as hell no flavor.and some how my bill was 90 bucks never again will i go to this over priced fake sushi spot .people that know good sushi will agree .not one roll wowed me .server sucked she walked by me 4 times before she refilled my water and the place was empty .,1
"If you think of sonic think of fake. This place has the worst milkshakes in the history of milk shakes. Trust me it was horrible. There was no chocolate in the thing. Sonic has definetly lost my support. Chocolate milk or just plain milk has earned the title of milkshake in the world of sonic. If you want a shake from sonic, just get milk from your refrigerator.",1
"So. I sent back my burger to be corrected for a veggie burger as I ordered , and when it came back about fifteen minutes later it was the same burger, on the same plate, with the same bite sized piece of meat I had pulled off still lying there. I just don't think I need to say more than that. You get the picture, I'm sure.",1
"Wow, I just called them to ask one simple question about take outs and the girl who answered the phone was SO fucking rude and she hung up on me when I wasn't even done and she also had an attitude going on. The food may be good but if their staff has this kind of attitude, it's not worth going. It was a young girl I believe. So disrespectful.",1
"Mmmm, supposedly homemade pastries! a lil too much on the sweet rather than savory side though. The chai was good but their soy milk was wierd. I tasted the espresso in my lady's capp and it seemed over roasted or too bitter. The usual overly friendly and caffeinated staff. There seemed to be lots of comfy nooks although a bum took up the best spot. . .",1
After reading all the great reviews I was looking forward to trying this place out. One word describes the experience disappointing. The thin crust pizza was ok but way over priced. The side order of Asparagus only a few strands was terrible. The short answer is that if you want to get over priced pizza then this is the place for you.,1
"I was a loyal client of Jessica's and really liked the first three or four cuts, colors, and service. I just went again and this is my last! She cut my hair so short and i hate the color. She said ""sorry "" in a text afterward and never offered a discount or to fix her mistakes. My hair is now so short there is not much if anything that I can do with it.",1
"The worst restaurant service I've had in my life. The waiters are actively hostile, the way hardened French waiters can be, without the charm of being in Paris. The food wasn't very good, at that. Zero percent tip. Two people on a not very busy night, and it took as long as a James Cameron movie. Ugh.",1
you must come here during happy hour. half off on some 100 beers they have on tap. go and explore. don't be scared to try out beers you have not heard of. you'll thank me for sure. they have an outside area if you wanna drink a brew in the heat. the inside has t.v.s where you can watch any sporting event going on. it's a definite hit up spot if you're in the area,2
"Went to Bandara tonight. We ordered the prime rib and it camr our RARE, very rare. We sent it back and guess what they stuck it under the salimander. How embarrasing. I confronted the manager and he wasnt very happy. We re ordered and on the third try it was rare but not as much. I have seen a drop in quality over the past year.",1
"I stopped by here today for my first ever Dutch Bros. experience. It was awesome! The crew was extremely nice and helpful. I will be back many times for sure! My iced latte is amazing! I definitely recommend this place! nSeriously, everyone here is so nice, they are sure to turn any bad morning into a great one!",2
I've waited 10 minutes for a bread bowl soup.seriously?! It's super slow and no one else is in line! The whole time the manager and employees have kept looking at me standing here and no one has bothered to ask me if I need any help. I finally had to speak up to get some service. This place was great before new management came in.,1
"My husband and I decided to go here for brunch on a Sunday morning. Of course, it was busy, but we were unimpressed. Isn't Denny's supposed to be equipped for busy on a Sunday morning? We ordered an appetizer, but it never came. The reasoning it takes a long time to cook them. Our food was OK, but it could have been better.",1
"When we discovered this secret in Montreal.we discovered heaven! The gelato and chocolate was as good as we had in Paris several years ago. nThey have 2 stores in Montreal, the servers were friendly, and couldn't have been more healthful with choices. Also, we took home some super chocolates, especially on with Chillie in it.and Lemoncello.",2
"Not very happy with the pharmacy. Dropped off my sick son's medicine at 3pm. Went through the the drive thru after 7pm and nobody could find the prescription anywhere. After 10 minutes it was ""found lost in the system "" I was a told to come back after they filled it. I guess my sick child is of no importance to them. I'll try CVS next time.",1
"Recently moved to Phoenix, and this place is in my neighborhood. El Pollo Loco is overpriced food with very small proportions. I spent like 10 on some quesadilla's and they came with a small packet of tortillas and mushy salsa. I'm a skinny guy, but was still hungry after eating this. The staff at this location seemed uninterested in their jobs both times I tried out them out. Not worth it.",1
"This is an excellent HAND car wash. They have an excellent staff with superb customer service. Their staff always gives you prompt and courteous attention, and their prices are very reasonable. They pay excellent attention to detail, vacuuming under mats and cleaning the insides of cup holders and a c vent slats. I absolutely love this car wash!",2
"We used to eat at the Good Egg on Union Hills regularly, however the service and food had been disappointing the past few visits. It's unfortunate the manager is lazy and it has degraded the operations. Food is slow to come out and undercooked. They don't have enough waitstaff so our waitress was working multiple sections of tables. Hopefully they will get a better manager soon.",1
"Went here for a late night drink late meaning 11 00 p.m. had a great martini. try the Sugar Snap Southside or the Grapefruit Basil. not usually a grapefruit fan, but this was gooood. As for the decor. very contemporary, grey slate tiles with cool accent lights. Need to go back to see the entire resort.",2
"The word ""Premium "" shouldn't be used here. This place is outdated and I really think the selection of stores are boring. The good news, especially in the summer time is that you have an indoor mall, unlike the North Outlets which has a much better selection of stores, but all outside. Unless they put some more interesting stores in here, I think I will continue to bypass it.",1
"I cheat one night a week on my diet, Im so disappointed I chose KFC last night. Never Again! Check your order before driving away, the staff forgot 2 of our sides we paid for which I guess ended up for the best considering the rest of our order tasted disgusting. Such a waste of 30 our time! We should've just went to Chili's.",1
My husband and I try to stop here whenever we are in Madison for the week. They have items that suit our young son when he is with us and they have items and suit our tastes as well. The service on the several occasions that we have gone has been great but I don't believe we've ever gone on a particularly busy day.,2
"Came here last August because My friends and I were staying at the Hard Rock. Uhhh, Not much to say but their food is mediocre. Came in during Mid day. It was very dead so I cant say much about the atmosphere. Maybe it gets better at night who knows? nAnyways, I believe I had their Mac and Cheese and Buffalo wings? Oh and their coconut mojito? I forgot. But eh, I wouldn't come here again.",1
"Store isn't the same since the climbing rock wall closed. It is nicely stocked with camping and sporting equipment, spacious, spread out and the staff friendly. It's a two story facility so there is plenty of areas to explore, I was surprise to see the prices of the treadmills, they have the best of the best for those prices. Other items seem reasonably priced.",2
Nice place but our king sized bed sagged in the middle and hurt my back. Then there was only one small trash can for the entire suite. The mini bar fridge system was too sensitive and we were charged even though we spoke to three people who said that they wouldn't charge us since we didn't consume anything.,2
"What can I say? We ended up here 2 of the 4 nights we were in Vegas. It has a great view and it doesn't get super packed. It is easy to socialize with others and the drinks are great. It definitely has the best view of the strip out of any other place. The girls we were with managed to get us all in for free to Moon, Playboy and Ghostbar every night. D",2
"I've given this place several chances and they still fail! You have a 50 50 chance on having your coffee drink made correctly. Even with specific instructions, decent tip they can't get it right. Cappuccinos are not lattes! Worse, I saw the register girl placing all the cookies on the tray with her bare hands. yes. the ones that she is using to handle cash. YUCK!",1
Once again you messed up. When a person asks to not have items included such as onions or raisins it means they do not want them! nAlso ripe cucumbers are not soft and are not discolored. Yours consistently are both of these. nI have tried you many times but after this take out disaster I'm done with you Pita Jungle. You simply stink!,1
"I went to the Yard House location back in Florida and love it just the same. The food is really good. Since it was so pretty outside, we decided to sit outside under the covered area. It took a bit of time to be served our food, otherwise everything was great. Our server Kristen was really nice. I will return in the near future",2
"Stopped in today and WOW! The owner, Desyree I believe, was super friendly and gave me probably at least a dozen samples without me prompting her. Everything I had was delicious, seriously. Ended up coming home with pear gorgonzola and the chocolate and red pasilla pepper as well. Can't wait to dig into them tonight! ",2
I haven't had a bad experience yet. Even when I get to the airport late I seem to get through security fast and on time for my flight. The staff is usually very helpful asking if I need a ride to my gate but I politely decline. I wouldn't want to take that opportunity away from someone who is unable to walk the distance. So far it's one of the better airports in the US.,2
Ive been doing business with them for about 6 months now. This place is neat and clean. They know their stuff. Tammi offeres many options to help keep costs down. I like they have U Haul truck rentals. Tammi knows the business and also has alot of other things so just ask. Its nice to see nice people giving great service.,2
"What to say about Angelas? The Best Italian Food in the area. Pasta fagioli, lentil, italian wedding soup all my favorites and they are fresh. Had the veal special and it was scrumptious, tender in tomato sauce that was really gravy as in tomatoes flavored by the juices from the veal. Not a bad dish in the place and we have sampled quite a few. I have recommended this place to EVERYONE I know lol!",2
"Hey YELP.can I get a 10 star rating please!?!?!? nMy ""check in's "" here don't accurately depict how often I enjoy this food. My family is now down with the BFG, and my brother brings it home REGULARLY! nNew highlights n THE WEEKLY SPECIAL.oh my! nThis week it's chickeachos and last week it was BiBimBap.well done guys, WELL DONE! n nI can't get enough of this place!",2
"This is a great hotel if you don't plan on gambling. However, I like to play blackjack in Vegas and the Palazzo has lowered the black jack payout from 3 2 to 6 5. In other words they more than doubled the casino's take how much you are expected to lose. I think this is a very scummy move and there are plenty of other great hotels to chose from.",1
"This place is tiny. If this place were a dog, it would be one of those small yipping dog that doesn't realize how tiny it is because they blast the music like they're Consol Energy Center, featuring JT. And don't go unless you're over the age of 40 because that seems to be the trend. Actually that's probably why the music is so loud.so all those elders can hear it!",1
"I am probably not the best person to be reviewing this as this was my first time ever at a driving range. It seemed really nice and it was easy to get a basket of balls and find a spot even on a beautiful day when it was packed. While my golf skills were not what I had hoped, I will definately be going back.",2
I've been coming here for almost 2years. My best girls to recommend are Goma and Manisha. I never have to wait long and the location is near other essential stores. The customer service is nice and the atmosphere is peaceful. I well continue to get my eyebrows done here as I went through trial and error to find the right person. Thanks ladies!,2
I ordered the country fried steak and it tasted artificial. The service was awful coffee tasted old and watery and it took forever to take our order and for them to bring our good. My boyfriend ordered the omelette fried rice it was okay. We also got the red velvet pancakes and the lemon ricotta pancakes they were good. the only thing good about this place were the pancakes.,1
"I love this little shop! The yogurt is yummy! I especially like the Root Beer Float, Red Velvet and Cake Batter. I also love their selection of toppings and that they include FRESH fruit like blueberries. The only downfall for me was no Reese's PB cup topping just minis . But this is definitely my yogurt shop of choice these days.",2
"I went out on a date with my girlfriend who drove down from Maryland for Lunch. Service was above par, Both sandwiches were done well, and we enjoyed our time at Red Robin. The only complaint I had was the fact that the fries that were served with the burger were luke warm at best and I requested a new order, and received a fresh batch, hot. They were delicious.",2

"My husband I went here on our 25th anniversary to get matching tattoos to celebrate my one year cancer free. Ruck happened to be in the shop and took me as a walk in. Chris did my husband's tattoo. They were friendly, professional and awesome! Considering this was my first tattoo, ruck was very patient. We will be back.they are top notch!",2
"i heart grand lux, and was so happy to find one in vegas it was quality food at a good price and i already knew what was on the menu to persuade the picky eaters in our group . we had the short rib and perogies, seared salmon with pea sauce, and the indochine shrimp and chicken. we were all very satisfied. the service was good and so was the food.",2
"NEVER AGAIN! Decor very dated. Towels were dingy. Outdoor corridors needed a good hosing. Pool area disgusting dirty . Cigarette butts everywhere. Ignored to use pol at the Arizona Grand.tried to save a few bucks, but was thoroughly disappointed. Wi Fi worked intermittently. Small tv, dis not swivel. Phone cord TAPED with scotch tape.",1
"Holy Bunny McDougal's batman! Each time I go to this Teeter I feel like I am the only person who isn't old money, a wasp and who doesn't go to the church across the street. That being said, if I do go I try to get in and out in a hurry, it's good if you need to drop in really quick to pick up a general supermarket item. But other than that.no.",1
I love JJ's! nThe sandwiches are good and they make them quick. I have never had a bad experience at this location. nI wish the parking were better sometimes but I guess a full lot means they are doing something right. With Omelette House nearby at busy times you can end up parking just about anywhere in the lot and walking to JJ's lol.,2
"IF you find this place and you'll probably have to ask someone in the hotel , you'll be pleasantly surprised by the understated, throw back vibe of what feels like your local pizzeria. You have to get the white pizza, no matter what. It is amazingly tasty and full of garlic, cheesy goodness. There are no tables, so be prepared to stand and eat or to take and go.",2
I really like Hungry Howies Pizza so I continue to buy food from there. Here's the catch. Don't use the internet because they won't even pay attention to the order I know this because it happened to me and don't deliver because it will take at least and hour and a half twice happened to me . So basically order over the phone and go and pick it up.,1
"Pizza and wings were tasty but here are the reasons I will NEVER go back! 1 spent 120 to dine in and they charged us 50 cents for ranch dressing n2. Bathroom inside was employees only, had to walk down a slope and thru rocks and gravel around the back of the building for restroom n3 no wet wipes for 30 wings n4 extremely rude staff",1
cheap ass guys their. I go to the club all the time and never meant any cheap ass guys in my fucking life. pay 5 dollars for parking. SKY vodka only. No bottle service for women. If you want perverted guys this is the place to go. If you want to get dick slanged and eye fucked this is the place to go. PERVERTS i tell you !,1
"This is a really fun gaming supply shop that is a toy store for grown ups. Everything from dice and cards to full on poker tables can be found here. I ordered from this place back in 2009 when I needed some dice and their prices were very good. They have since gone up, but it's a neat place to find some oddities nonetheless and their staff is very friendly.",2
Frozen dinners taste better than the food at this place. nThe veggies definitely came from cans. The ceveiche sucks. Just because they serve fish doesn't mean that they know how to cook it. I have had beef jurcky that more moist. So many better options at the Rio. Do not go unless you like tasteless food for 50 bucks a plate.,1
"So freaking affordable! The food is average cafe food, but the coffee is hot and the service is pretty good too. I've eaten Lunch and Breakfast here, and prefer their breakfast menu. All of the food is about 5 to 8 and their portions are rather large. Don't go here if you're looking for healthy or fresh. Go here if you want greasy hangover food that will fill you up for cheap.",2
"Worse club ever. Took forever to get into even though we were in the very front of the line. Ugly girls, not so skinny girls, old girls, and rude security guys with super annoying flashlights. Super expensive drinks. Jager bombs are 17!? WTF. I'm only giving it two stars because of the cool hot bartenders and the three seperate dance floors which each have a whole different vibe.",1
"Yes, it is a dive bar. Yes, there are animal heads on the wall. But the staff is great and they serve an awesome grilled pastrami panini the New Yorker . The prices are very reasonable, the fish fry has a huge following, and who could ask for more than a climate controlled smoking patio? Give it a chance!",2
"Trendy and fun spot to eat and drink. Everything is so good at Fez for any time of the day. I was pretty surprised by how differently delicious the salads were.I mean, come on, when are salads ever worth paying for at a restaurant. Definitely worth it here. nThey always have great daily drink specials, and the waiters have always been amazing.",2
If you have kids this is definitely one of the places to bring them. I don't know why but I always expect aquarium to be larger then they are. It was pretty cool though. You get to walk through a jungle like area and then pet some sting rays. Finally you get to see the sharks! It was fun and educational.,2
Richard did an amazing job taking care of my husky. You can tell he really cares about dogs and how he handles them. I would definitely recommend him to anyone I know to use this service. He was happy to work an appointment time with me and he was very friendly. My dog still wanted to play with him afterwards! It was a fun and convenient experience.,2
I was not happy with the bait and switch technique this company and Southwest Airlines pulled on me last night. I declined all the extra fees and the cost was more than what my Southwest Airlines conformation letter stated. Even the employee felt bad with what I had to say. He had heard it before from previous customers. Shame on you Payless. Shame on you Southwest.,1
"First visit here at Papas tonight. The worst food and customer service i've witnessed in a long time. Girl at cash register was rude, the tables were dirty, floor dirty, and we watched my wife's taco's prepared by cook with bare hands, a clear violation of the health code. This place won't last six months, terrible food, terrible service, not sure where all these great reviews are coming from.",1
" 15 bucks to get train wrecked for the whole night and you get a novelty cup to show your friends how much of a fruitcake you are? I'm in. 190 octane plus 2 shots of 151 or do they use Everclear? Who cares, AMIRITE? will be more than sufficient. Did I mention the extra shots are only a buck each? Make sure you mix it up real good. If you don't, you'll be chugging pure 151 towards the end.",2
"We ordered delivery, it was excellent. I have read reviews saying this place has bad customer service, we bypassed this by ordering online and almost didn't even gave a word with the delivery person other than a thank you. Food was good, reminded me of an italian corner restaurant in Philly. Well order here again.",2
"Breakfasted at LePeep on Saturday. Service was good. The pancake special sounded delicious bacon and pecan. Ordered one. It was okay. The ""signature "" potatoes were dry and a paltry serving. Other than there being something vaguely familiar about my waitress, it was an uneventful visit. As I said, food was mediocre. Won't try it again.",1
"I've never had a bad meal here! It can get crowded, once you taste the food you will see why. We love the entire appetizer menu. You could also try the vodka penne de parmia.everything is so good. Last time we went the waitress told us that it is ALL DAY EVERY DAY happy hour! from now on? YES. I wish we lived close. We would be here all the time.",2
"My god. The tasting menu, people, the tasting menu! Getting through the chef's tasting menu at Aureole is a two and a half hour adventure, better than any blue man de soleil could ever offer. The wine list and the wine angels are both heavenly, and Andrew Bradbury the sommelier is sure to find you something that fits every course. You haven't eaten in Vegas until you've tasted the perky Aureole.",2
"Good food and staff. I had the Brisket Pulled pork with a side of Fries fruit. Also came with some sliced pickles and texas toast. Good experience and it lived up to my friends recommendation. I'm not always on that side of town, but I could see making it a frequent place to visit as the food and BBQ sauce options were all good.",2
"I have been here five or six times, and each time I have had a great experience. The food is very good, and is also reasonably priced. The sangria is delicious, and the atmosphere is very cool. They do a great job with big groups as they have two rooms that are both very nice and private. If you are on the strip and like tapas you have to try this place.",2
"Had dinner there a few days ago with a large group. Bartender over charged for two drinks to start with and his boss had to return me 9 dollars . nNext was dinner . The prime rib had a large portion of fat and not tasty. The seafood starter didn't taste fresh, bread was ok and the salad was bland. The dessert cheesecake was very plain. Ended up paying over 120 for a meal worth about 30 tops.",1
"Fresh 52 is ok, barely. The corn man had the best deal at 5 buds for 3. But I'm not a big corn fan. I wanted some strawberries or apricots. Maybe some spinach or green beans. Some kale perhaps. Maybe some apples. But I'm not paying 5 for a pound of strawberries when I can get 2 for 5 at Sprouts. 4 for a pound of green beans. Yea. I'm getting in my car right now going to my nearest Sprouts.",1
We went to Niro's all the time when we lived in Ahwatukee. It's great. My wife loved the greek fries. Everything we tried from there was consistently good. Their greek salad dressing is amazing. The owner is typically in there and he's a really friendly guy. Went there dozens of times and never had a bad experience.,2
"It was a fun place to go, but the fries were way to salty to even eat and the burger was just alright. It was a fun experience, but it is making me sick and regretting going there. I guess if you are over 350 your body can handle this food a lil easier, but if you're not I would recommend looking elsewhere.",1
This place has changed owners and names. It actualy has two names now which makes it very confusing. Venues and 34 Easy. I am local and even I could not find this place . I had to call them. Once there service was slow food was so so for the pricey tag. My friend never got her side of hot sauce. They seemed under staffed as well. Won't go back.,1
"Theres little to say other than that I love this place. Cheap, fast, and they deliver. All of the meats, cheeses, veggies, and breads are fresh. Never had a bad customer service experience. The only thing I can really attest to is that they are liberal users of mayo be aware of that when ordering online and ask for packets instead. P",2
"Pulled in on my way home from work for a low pressure check. It was the day of the Big storm this week and I knew they would be busy. They were. And, they were all calm, in good spirits, and kept things moving. Said I was 62 today for a pressure check, crazy. I waited no more than 10 minutes. Absolutely great service!",2
"Great NY pie. Thin crust cooked crisp at the bottom with a high temp oven. Sauce was very tasty. Cheese was perfect for a NY pie a little salty and with a little oil.just the way it should be . Crust was tasty and the right thickness. Good place. Not sure I can rate it ""as good as it gets "".maybe next time. For now, I'm a fan.",2
"Simply great Mexican food at great prices. Without a doubt, I will be eating here often as I attempt to eat everything on their menu. Service was excellent, but their food is the reason I'll keep going back. With real Mexican food restaurants like this, I have no idea how Taco Bell exists in Arizona.",2
"I've been around the proverbial gay bar block, so to speak, so my expectations are pretty high. However, tonight proved to be a good time here. It's a very relaxed atmosphere with excellent drink specials and fun, friendly people to small talk with. Calm, supportive, flirty and fun.Plazma is a good bar to be yourself.",2
"Joe's is a strip gem which I always recommend to visitors. Even though I don't get to the strip very often I try to hit it at least once a year for their lunch special. This year I did Christmas day and had the crab bisque, a serving of the ""whale "" appetizer, and half a piece of their seasonal pecan pumpkin pie. Excellent as always.",2
"Poor service, no sugar cubes, the tea was fine and the little side dishes are a hit and miss more misses . Quite disappointed with the overall experience and expensive for what it offers. The seating arrangements are interesting and the venue tries to give off a faux posh atmosphere. They should look at Alice's Mad Teahouse in NYC for inspiration. Do not go here or proceed at your own risk.",1
I love this place! The waiting area is more comfortable and welcoming than my home. The staff is helpful and charming. The work is always honest and clearly explained. I would never let anyone else touch my car. So glad to have an auto repair shop run by people who clearly care so much about their customers!,2
I have been trying to sign up for about 1 week now! No one knows anything about discounted fees with your health insurance plan. UnitedHealth care offers a discount for a gym membership. Golds being one of them. I printed the form and staff knows NOTHING! I also called UnitedHealth care just to make sure and yes we do get a discount. I also sent an email to golds headquarters NO REPLY,1
"awesome, awesome, awesome. did I say awesome? My wife and I have been coming here for 20 years. perfect steak, perfect service and for 50 per plate with all the fixings, you can't beat it. we have ate at these so called exclusive steak houses only to leave 400 less and still hungry for a cheeseburger. The Steakhouse cannot be more perfect.",2
"This place is good. It's a nice little shining star of hip ness in downtown Buckeye. The decor is fresh and new, the staff all wore a smile and the food is GOOD. I got a pork loin sandwich and oh my goodness. The chips are delicious. The meat was tender and fresh. The flavors were spot on. I will definitely be back I've gotta try one of those famous cinnamon rolls!",2
"I sew for a living and have been shopping in this store for over 20 years . Yes it's a little cluttered , yes it can get busy and take a little time, but what I love most is YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOUR'RE GOING TO FIND! If you have a little creative edge, go there. And as for the staff, I love those broads! They'll dish it out, just enjoy it! Where else are ya gunna get that?",2
"I tried the Cottage Grove location as it was closest to where we live when we first moved to Madison. Just tried Sun Prairie after a period of a couple years. Had avoided regularly based on first experience. Same. Consistently mediocre, bordering on bad Chinese food. Both Cottage Grove and Sun Prairie consistent over span of years. Don't bother.",1
"I've only been here once but the time I went, I felt the food was a bit expensive for what we got. It's not bad and the staff is incredibly nice, but it didn't impress me in particular. Also, when when I ordered the egg roll and asked how many pieces we get, the server told me 8. When the eggroll came, it was just two eggrolls cut into 8 tiny pieces. Haha.what the hell.",1
"Come on guys, we recently received a deliver menu for this location. We called to place a take out order. Many items are no longer offered, no Greek fries, etc. why send out a flyer that is not correct. The sandwiches were all bread, I was very disappointed about the quality of food and menu. We will not be going back! Stay clear of this place.",1
The last tome I was in I was waiting for my motorcycle to be finished woth service next door. The wings tastes awful and the fries were clearly frozen store bought. The place still smelled like rotten feet. Later that night I got terribly sick and had diarreah for hours. Clearly the chicken had turned. Will not go back! Truly awful!,1
Awesome! Grabbed burgers here with my boyfriend and his brother and girlfriend the day before NYE. We all loved our burgers and fries. I'm celiac and got a gluten free bun and omission beer! ChaChing! Sweet potato waffle fries are awesome too. Would recommend to anyone and definitely eat here again!,2
"This is definitely the best restaurant in Montreal for rotisserie chicken! The chicken is so tasty, juicy and tender, and their fries are amazing. While the decor is out dated, you go to this place for the food, not the ambience. After trying their chicken, I'm certain that you will never want to go to St Hubert's ever again.",2
"This place was out of this world, great staff and friendly. Chicken apple Gouda with cage free eggs and spinach was delish and OMG the home fries were outta this world. Nice tasty thick sliced wheat toast and homemade strawberry jelly to compliment the meal was one experience I will never forget. Matts Big Breakfast is a must to visit again when in the 602 area.",2
"I just switched OB offices and it was the best switch ever! I'm on my 4th little one and Mary Nurse Practitioner was great! Old doc told me I had no chance of a VBAC and Mary said otherwise which was music to my ears, however I do know emergencies may happen. Great office atmosphere, everyone is fun and helpful and they plan your appts if possible 3 months in advance!",2
"We will never eat here again. We tried the enchiladas, carne asada tacos, and the ceviche. Good grief. All 3 dishes tasted horrible. The enchiladas were smothered with a gross chipotle sauce, the carne asada tacos tasted awful, and the ceviche was way too tangy. Don't waste your here. Save your pesos. Trust me on this.",1
"I was excited to try this buffet in Vegas but boy was I disappointed, the quality of foods is bad. It's like going to a 9.99 buffet. I'm used to quality since I've been going to Wicked Spoon for the longest. All I can say it taste like a cheap buffet and there's nothing I enjoyed. Avoid at all cost unless they revamp the place.",1
"I have seen all of the shows in Vegas. Heard many great things about O so I left the best for last. Oh boy was i disappointed! First of all its very overated and over priced. Second, there was no story line, a bunch of nothing. The acrobats were OK. Nothing to really make me say Wow. Honestly, i napped through some of the Show. From all the shows in Vegas, Le Reve is still my favorite.",1
"Both times I've been to this location I was amazed that waitresses could be soooo horrible and still keep their jobs. 1 Didn't know what draft beer was. 2 Totally screwed up the order, extra sauce wings came out with no sauce, wrong drink. The worst part is that both times they acted like it was our fault.",1
"Stopped in for a quick pregamble drink. I chose the ""Vegas Baby "" and baby, it was good! My friend ordered a triple tequila, and she made it a little stronger, didnt go unappreciated! Very good service. Awesome place with a great vibe. Love how its separate, but the ""walls "" are minimal with spots to see through. I know, great description. Just google the pics ",2
"Their chicken ALWAYS tastes dry. The staff is not friendly, and the last time I went in there, the person taking orders and adding toppings did not speak english.wow. Although I live within a 2 minute drive, I go to the Salsarita's in Cotswold. They have better chips, fresher ingredients, larger burritos, better salsa.and their chicken isn't dry!",1
Finally checked out Cream accidentally. A friend of a friend was having a b day party there. This place is tiny! I was told what the overall concept was but not sure they could ever pull it off due to its diminutive size. I don't ever feel the need to darken this place's doorstep ever again. I can watch girls dance in empty bath tubs at my house. Lol.,1
"Every time I walk in, Chef Young knows my name and there's always sake bombs involved! A show at the the sushi bar and definitely a must to order the 6 layer sushi! Being friends and enjoy! Greeted with a smile everytime and always checked on. No plates left at the table, drinks always full and always great conversation!",2
"I just went here this afternoon to try the lunch special pad thai and.it was great! I called to pick it up and it took about 15 minutes to be ready. I got the beef thai, chicken pad thai, and a small rice. The total was about 19. The portion was decent and the lunch specials came with a wonton and an egg roll. I will definitely return.",2
"Very nice resort. Staff was friendly and responsive. We stayed in a King suite with a view of pool area looking west to mountains. Room was fantastic well appointed. Among the few, would certainly recommend. The Venetian and the Palazzo are connected via the Canal Shops. Many quality restaurants and shops.",2
"My husbands favorite, I go for the frozen yogurt and the choice of one frozen yogurt choice and two or three sorbet choices has me feeling, left out but for all the many choices kudos I guess, the place is run by teenagers so customer service is spotty but they listen and never had any complaints on accuracy,.",1
"Quite simply, the best authentic tacos in Vegas. Be sure to try them ""with everything "" house made guac, cilantro, and grilled veggies. The flan they sell by the register isn't bad, either! This place is ideal for grab 'n' go I'm a fan of ordering a dozen tacos and bringing them home to share with my roommates.",2
"The fry sampler is awesome. I had a lobster dinner that was perfect. To top it all off I had a smores dessert that was amazing. I went there with family on a comp. I probably wouldn't pay to go there because it was expensive, but the food was delicious. Servers are very attentive and helpful. They replaced my grandmother's dessert for another when she didn't like it.",2
It amazes me how HD stays in business. Employes look dumbfounded when you need to know where an item is. Yesterday I asked a assoc. where an item was located. I had to repeat myself 4 times because he couldn't remember the name of the item I was looking for. Without fail when shopping there isn't a time that at least one item I'm looking for is always out of stock.,1
"Great show for adults and kids. I've seen Copperfield, Siegfried and Roy, Lance Burton and several others. Rouven's illusions are up there with any of them if not better, but delivered in a humorous and endearingly self effacing manner. Top notch. nWish he were in a better venue than the Riviera, but I imagine that will change in the future.",2
"I've gone twice and I'll go again. The variety of lamb shanks is great and super tasty especially the one with eggplant , the kafta was really great too. Only thing is they put way too much onions on everything, so if you don't love them, warn the servers! The fattoush salad is perfect. The place gets busy and very noisy, so if you have sensitive ears it might not be the best place for you.",2
"I have loved this place for about 20 years. I have moved several times, each time farther from Villa Deli, but I still make the drive back for those wonderful party subs, with fabulous meat and tantalizing dressing. Their salads, especially the artichoke salad, is a real treat, and I love their basic sandwich as well. So much better than a franchise, this place is a quiet treasure.",2
Closed Circuit event is a rip off definitely not 110 worthy! Shitty service they don't let anyone sit on the tables couches but that doesn't matter I get it but at least have some chairs for ppl other than reserved not long tables! Screens are average size nothing special . Drinks good. Would I Come again? Hell no. Disappointed.,1
"Marilyn is the best colorist! I would recommend her for brown or blonde hair. I personally have brown hair. She can do highlights on brown hair and they actually grown in great and look natural. I have gone to so many colorist but none of them listen and actually do what I want with my color. She is caring, skilled and good. I am happy to have found her!",2
"If you are buying cupcakes only for showcasing ! These cupcakes are over prized , no flavour what so ever . 3.50 for one cupcake and the cupcakes taste terrible . The cake is dry , hard. And the the frosting, all the frostings almost taste the same, like eating a cup of sugar finely ground into a paste ! Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone .",1
"Went to this show a couple of years ago with my parents. Great show to take your kids, but not so great for older people. The novelty of 3 guys in blue suits pounding on drums got stale really quick. Also, their audience participation bits were pretty lame cheesy ex putting a spotlight on people coming late . Would not see this show again.",1
"I saw Blue Man Group with several friends last Monday. It's difficult to describe the show because it's unique. The show is very funny and they also play some awesome industrial rock. If you order tickets, try doing it online using the promo code, ""smarter40 "" on its website. It's 40 off. You can't get that discount if you call the box office.",2
"Tried them at the Las Vegas Food Fest this past weekend. Very good ice which is hard to find in Las Vegas. nI like the flavor selection as well, both the cherry and black cherry were great. I enjoyed the cherry pieces in the cherry ice. nHave not yet tried the ice cream but that will be next on the list, too bad they are way across town.",2
" u00c0 date, le meilleur sushi pour livraison que je connaisse u00e0 Mtl! nTout est d u00e9licieux, impossible d' u00eatre d u00e9 u00e7u! N u00e9anmoins, il vous faut absolument tester les Sp u00e9cialit u00e9s Du Chef! Elles sont toutes accompagn u00e9es de leur propre sauce, rep u00e9r u00e9es par une petite u00e9tiquette coll u00e9e sur le pot. nVraiment, u00e0 tester!",2
Serving persian food in fast food setting. Very clean and well done food. I had chicken kabob plate and cucumber and yogurt. Liked the quality of food and the atmosphere. The lady un the counter was noce and helpful. The food was reasonably priced. Liked the freshly baked bread as well. I recommend if you are passing through the area of working close by. Not suitable for parties of dates ! Lol,2
"Literally sitting with an employee Jessica telling us to move somewhere else. Saying how Aventura is ""just standard "" and looking up other apartments she was raving about on her own computer for us. Um that's got to say something about the apartments. Clearly the people that work there are even downgrading themselves! So shocked I was out of there practically running!",1
"This place is adorable! It's the small and cozy kind of place you expect to see in a Hallmark Christmas movie. And it's the kind of place that you can easily find yourself becoming a 'regular'. The staff were really nice,service was fast and the food was delicious and cheap. I will definitely be back!",2
"1 Great atmosphere n1 Friendly Staff n3 Best Coffee in Downtown Phoenix or maybe in all Phoenix. nMy coffee always taste the same. Very good and they always make a cute latte art. nThe only bad thing is their parking, sometimes i don't find where to park and i have to go another coffee, but i think they are relocating soon. nGo try this place!",2
"Group of 5 guys just wanting some coffee and a small meal. Food was good but for starters the coffee was cold, everyone had to ask for fresh coffee. Waitress didn't even know the menu and asked "" what else am I supposed to ask you on that one? "" Ha! Are you kidding me. Ohh and as soon as we enter the door the first thing you hear is cursing, by the staff!?! Come on people.",1
"This place was surprisingly way better than I thought. Came at 10 40 ish. Paid for breakfast, but got breakfast and lunch. Came in during the transition. Their beef sausage different from the breakfast sausage was very tasty. Also really like their flank steak. The Mexican rice was also very good. You seriously cannot beat the price",2
"Porgy's is off the chain. I've been going here since I was a kid and you can smell it from a mile away. My friends and I used to have the daily specials memorized and it almost doesn't matter what you order because you can put their bbq sauce on literally anything, and it tastes good. To this day, sometimes I sit and ponder what could possibly be in their sauce. This place is a staple of Urbana.",2
This place is great! My dad and I both get our work done here for our BMWs because the service is good and fair. We won't go anywhere else because their work is hands down the best in town. Victor is very honest and straight forward with repairs that need to be done so I feel at ease knowing my car is in good hands. I recommend this place to anyone who owns a BMW.,2
"The coffee is alright not as good as piccolo just a few steps away yet some of the staff is very rude. Totally turned me off from this place. Not only was she girl with glasses screaming at my friend to get out of the way, she was then talking smack for a while later. Childish and totally inappropriate especially having payed 5 for a coffee. What a waist!",1
Had the crepegg sort of a crepe with an omelet in it. The food was ok nothing special. The coffee was ok as well. If I need to go to a breakfast chain again I think I'll chose the nearby IHOP over the good egg. The booths are massive and can easily fit six people comfortably. I didn't have the pancakes but thought it was weird that they charge extra if you want the real maple syrup.,1
The smells are wonderful. Cannot wait to taste! The employees are not to friendly at first. They seemed impatient when were we trying to decide on what to order. Hope the food is outstanding to make up for the employees. nWell sorry to say the pizza was old. We ordered a pepper and egg sandwhich and that was good.,1
Tonight the shrimp was over done and the waitress did not care. She was having a grand time with the table next to us that had a single guy but never even checked to see how we were doing. We sent one shrimp back and she never bothered to see how the next batch came out! It sucked also under any circumstance do not get the Michelle with 2 l's she is HORRIBLE! Michele with 1 L is awesome!,1
"Besides the fact that there were 3 kids working that didn't seem to care that we were there, blasting loud distasteful music, and no joke there was grease all over the floors, the chicken was garbage. Overcooked and very dry as if it was sitting there all day. Chips and waffle were good but I definitely will not be going back.",1
"Stayed here once. And no joke, on my floor alone we saw police take down a group smoking dope in their room and also prostitutes walking around saying hello to us. Yeah. But other than that ""excitement "" it was an enjoyable stay. The casino is nice. The location is a tad off The Strip, but not far. Rates were extremely low probably because they make money off the prostitutes on the side!",1
"A little kitchy, but a very fun experience and the food was quite good. I loved the attendant in the ladies bathroom I just wish I had known about her so I could bring to tip her. We did not have dessert because we were late for our show not the restaurants fault, our fault , next time I will be ordering a souffle they looked amazing!",2
I use to love this place before the new owners. I won't get into my reasons for never coming back again except it is not comfortable for myself or my family anymore. I did give this place more then one chance so my reasons aren't based on one thing. My time and money will be spend at other restaurants.,1
"This place was incredible! I loved the Funghi pizza. THe mushrooms, goat cheese and truffle oil is to die for! The Yukon pizza is also incredible.with the thin sliced potatoes on it, yummmm! Love the ambiance, it used to be a hair salon hence the name Parlor. I am thoroughly looking forward to going back for happy hour!",2
"I live in LA and am SO EXCITED that ""Carlos "" has opened a new location that I can stop off in on my way to visit family in Phoenix. Their food is one of the things I look forward to most when I get back to Arizona, even if it's only a few times a year I can't visit without getting a 13 combination to go.",2
"Excellent food service Chicken is so fresh the workers there really show that they love their job. I was there last night the night manager ""Kenny "" a younger guy brought out our food was checking on us to see if we needed anything He had a spark in his eye said he would own a chik fil a himself one day.now thats what i like to see in my employees!",2
"Generally clean, but of course it shows the use of many patrons who don't cleanup after themslves. Usually there's an attendant on duty wiping and sweeping. The machines accept an onsite credit card that you'll load with paper money, so don't bother saving up quarters for this place. Oh, and it opens at 6am!",2
"Perhaps we were there on a really ""off "" night, but the four of us were extremely disappointed in the meal. The salmon and pork belly entrees came out cold and had to be sent back. The chicken all dark meat much to my husband's chagrin was look warm. The service was adequate, but not great. The only positive remark I have is that it is a darling little place.",1
"Most everything I have had here has been delicious. The coconut curry soup is amazing. I get it with the spinach and cheese quesadilla and it is a great combination. Their hummus is delicious, too and you have to try the tropical tea. Can't wait for my next visit. The host is also a really nice guy and has always been very friendly when we were waiting for a table.",2
"I would give an even lower rate if possible Dr Eva Evan is the most ill informed vet at this hospital she runs unnecessary test and has no follow through. She told me a three month subscription for insulin would last 6 mo NEW FLASH one bottle is only good for 30 days ask any diabetic out there never never will I ever let this women touch my dog,",1
"I have tried Chen Wok a few times. I think I kept hoping the food would get better since they deliver. It hasn't gotten any better, and I've finally given up. We had orange chicken and cashew chicken with fried rice last time. Everything was bad. They delivered quickly and were friendly. If only the food were appetizing ",1
Came here for dinner with a group of people. I didn't pay for any of the food I ate nor did I order any of it. I was lucky enough to be on an all expense paid trip. All I know is that I ate the best damn meatball I've ever tasted. Everything else was good but my group was talking about these meatballs for 3 days. Enough said!,2
"So I wanted to try this place just because I have heard about Scott Conant so much and I figured I has to try this tomato basil pasta that is so famous and costs so much. My mom and I got the tasting menu. The famous, signature pasta wasn't the best and there were two dishes that we absolutely both refused to finish because they weren't good. For the price and the hype, I was pretty disappointed.",1
Eden's grill has very tasty food. Good vegetarian selection. Delicious rice and falafel. The service is warm and friendly. Its a bit pricey compared to other nearby Mediterranean restaurants but the food tastes like it was made with love. FYI You can place orders for their fantastic rice for the holidays. I heard it is amazing with turkey dinners. I plan on it for next Thanksgiving.,2
"Extremely overpriced for what you get. Not nearly as good as it's hyped up to be. Ate here once and I will not return. There are much better alternatives IMO. Only myself and one other family eating yet the tables were all dirty. No combo deals, you add what you want to your burger and end up paying for each item!",1
"Typical Indian fare with nothing especially good or bad. Friendly but slow service. Portions are small, but prices are reasonable. Bring your own wine or beer but there is no Kingfisher to be found in the depanneur across the street. Unfortunately, at 7 00 p.m., they dim the lights and turn up the Indian techno music, spoiling any chance for table wide conversation.",1
"It's a great concept and I think it has a lot of promise, but it doesn't seem as if they were really ready to open. Pizza is not consistently available, prices seem to change daily, and the service seems to be stuck on the ""first day "" pace. I've tried it 4 times now because I want to love it, but I think I'm done.",1
"Do not go here unless you like to listen to a sales pitch and have the guy not listen to you when you tell him what you want. I pulled up on a Saturday morning and there weren't many cars there. The one car that was in line pulled back out and left as did I after the guy wouldn't take no to his offers. I went to Danny's and used my coupon. No sales job, just got the car washed",1
"The newly renovated lounge is a perfect place for a chill night in Vegas great vibe and atmosphere, fantastic music, delicious cocktails and most importantly FRIED OREOS. We ordered the Ricotta Meatballs, Tomato Basil Pizza, and the Calamari all of which was incredible, but did I mention the friend oreos? Yeah, one of the best things I've ever tasted!",2
"Overpriced crap from Mexico mostly. Can save you a trip across the border for kitschy junk, but that's about it. Not at all what I thought it would be based on the name. The place is littered with made to look old items that aren't. The worst kind of deception a retailer can try to pull on the unsuspecting. I am unimpressed, will not be back.",1
If they had a star for ZERO I would be doing that.I never even got the taxi because the receptionist dispatch was so RUDE.I understand for the safety of the driver but after your RUDE to me and out me on HOLD for 5 min.I would much rather take my money somewhere else.if I were that receptionist boss she would be FIRED.,1
"At most buffets I at least leave feeling full, unfortunately I can't say the same for this one. While there is a large quantity of different food options, the quality makes many of those options inedible. There were a few different things that I was able to eat but for the most part I filled up on the desserts and not the actual food.",1
business is picking up at dim sum cafe. yeah! I knew people would not be footed. These new owner's aren't new to town or the industry. THIS IS THEIR SECOND LOCATION a sister restaurant to the Huge dim sum Chinese restaurant on Sahara the Orchid Garden. personally I prefer the more up scale style at the new location for dinner.,2
This place is a DUMP. That's the easiest way to put it. The valet was no where to be seen. The parking garage was horrible. The elevators were slow and dirty. The rooms was disgusting. The employee I dealt with was nice enough. I paid for the room in hotels.com but I didn't stay there. I just got a room somewhere else. That's how bad it was. I uploaded some pics to show how bad it was.,1
"This place is only good if you place one order for one item. If you place an order for more than one person they cannot handle it. This has happened more than once at this location. How do you screw up an order of one croissant with cheese, one croissant with ham and cheese, and one crossiant with ham egg and cheese.it's on the receipt and you can't read it.never coming back again",1
"Top quality, super fresh ingredients, simple delicate sauces that don't overpower the food, and great selection. A must for serious foodies. This is one of the few places where the natural flavor of the food shines. Even my professional chef friends eat here on a regular basis! A great place to eat with friends, but not if you are in a rush. Reservations recommended, especially after 7pm.",2
"The wash is OKAY. Takes WAAAAY too long. The people that meet you immediately try to sell you and walk away when you say no. Then, youre left alone to figure out if youre supposed to stay in your car or go inside. There was not a car in front of me when i pulled up. 40 min later im finally leaving. WAY too long.",1
We had our inspection a few days ago and Mike was AMAZING. I have worked with another inspector and he wasn't as nice and patient as Mike. My dad is English as a second language and Mike was wonderful. He had a printed report and an electronic one which was impressive. I will be going back to Southwest Premier Home Inspection and referring them to my friends from this point forward!,2
"I had a good experience with this hotel, due to the fact that our room was not ready when we arrived, and had come from nsouthern california, our host gave me an upgrade, and 75 room credit to any restaurant in the hotel. The room was stylish and everything was neat and tidy. Yayy to Palazzo I will be coming back.",2
"Guter Gasthof mit gutem Essen. Die Bedienung war aufmerksam und unaufdringlich. Das Rumpsteak habe ich auch kurz vor K u00fcchenschluss noch so bekommen, wie ich es bestellt habe. nVorbestellung oder Reservierung ist empfehlenswert, sonst kann es passieren, dass die Stube voll ist oder eine geschlossene Gesellschaft drinnen.",2
Something about this Panera bread upsets my stomach. nI've eaten at other Panera breads and felt fine. I talked with the manager and he rudely brushed me off. This place makes you sick and then mocks you for it. nAvoid it at all costs. Eat out of the trash cans near by for better food. nMy stomach is churning just thinking about it.,1
"My husband and I stayed here for a week. Our room was larger than expected, quiet, and exceptionally clean. Our room was cheap and we were even upgraded for free to a bigger room at checkin. We never had to wait long for an elevator and it was a quick walk to the strip. I did not gamble or eat at NYNY except for a pretzel. I will definitely stay here again.",2
"As a Vegas local I have seen many strip shows, including all the Cirque more than once. This is by far the BEST SHOW in LV Period. Nothing even comes close. I will go as far as saying it was one of my best life experiences. Left us in a state of total awe. Tip Dont sit close to the front.the further back the better. Massive stage.",2
"Absolutely NO guest PARKING here! You are forced to Valet Park your car and if you stay too late, they move your car across town and you will never find it until the next day! be extremely careful when you patronize this establishment! Do Not hand your keys to anyone! You have been warned! But they do have good food!",1
I needed some help with a faulty timer control box. Called in the morning and spoke with Mark. He was out by noon and had the problem fixed in short order. He also fixed a break in a drip line. Very pleasant and positive experience. I would recommend this company highly and will use them again if needed.,2
"I am always on the lookout for responsibly raised meats. This place has a great selection, friendly staff, and an awesome Saturday BBQ deal. You can also request they cook up a steak if you're not interested in the menu items. Plus, they work with the Belly app so you get points they add up to free stuff over time, awesome local butcher!",2
"Stopped in for a drink and a quick break from sight seeing an the sunshine. What a cool little place with a nice low key, casual at home feel. The owner was walking around talking to everyone and it seemed like a place I would find my whole family at. Didn't get to enjoy the food but it all looked and smelled delicious. Edmund is the best. Thanks for the great service!",2
Love the Poppin Mary! A Bloody Mary with a kick and a jalape u00f1o popper. Had a pudding shot those are awesome try the pumpkin one. Now for the food. Had the BBQ Plattet so good. The service was awesome and the place is clean. Need to come try it for yourself. Looking at the menu they have free breakfast on the weekend just buy a tea or coffee. Wow see you this weekend!,2
"Bar none, worst pizza experience I have ever received. Pizza showed up BLACK!. Please DO NOT ORDER HERE. This was my first time trying this place. Also asked for extra sauce on the side, of course that didn't happen. Please save your money and do not order from this place. I have pictures to prove it.",1
Wow. their flats are the BEST. really?! Since the ortho and the PT banned me from wearing any heels for this epic trip. I had to sport flats for our tokeight out. and thankfully my sis bought me a pair. orange and it matched my dress for the evening! Friendly staff. again because we were shopping. expensive as hell but really well worth it!,2
2 people working the night shift. Kid makes my food right after sweeping or something and doesn't bother washing or putting gloves on. Food went in the trash and Carl's Jr will never get my business again. Not surprised Dateline found them Hardee's to have an insane amount of health code violations.,1
Shame on kids club and their new pricing. My son used to love going here but now the open play is limited and costs more. The inside is nice and my 3 year old has a lot of fun there but now it is nearly impossible to find time to take him there. The membership cost isn't worth it either since there is little open play anymore. So ridiculous!,1
"Just an update Soon after I put up my previous review, Drai's management contacted me, apologized for what had happened and promised to rectify the situation. That was unexpected and really professional of them so I want to update my review to reflect on Drai's itself, not the shady promotor. We'll see whether they get the full 5 the next time I stop by!",2
"The Air Canada folks here are top notch. They do what they can to get you out of paying extra baggage fees for overweight luggage. The airport itself is nice enough, but involves a lot of walking. It would be nice if they had the moving belts. We did manage to get through security pretty quickly and efficiently.",2
"I almost wanted to give it a 3 star rating but that's only because it's my first time here so the originality of the environment is very intriguing. However, the food is mediocre and the service is less than. Very well intentioned staff but they need to get their act together. Slow seating despite plenty of open tables. Nice waiter but long wait for the food, drink refills and check ups.",1
My wife and I have now visited Naya twice and find it an exceptional addition to the dining options in Pittsburgh and in Squirrel Hill. The food is exquisite and prepared with great delicacy. The spices are exceptional. The service has been excellent and the host friendly and informative. I highly recommend it!,2
"This was my second visit nMust say one of the worst service at Hilton Honors.no welcome nNo acknowledge nNo courtesy Not worth the saving or points you get here nLocation is good, rooms ok. nPool poorly staffed nNo restaurant on property is a minus nClose to shops but crowd not the best.saw a brawl between 2 groups! Not worth a little saving.!",1
 15 for an acrylic fill and charged me 20. I asked why and the lady Lily who was doing my nails said they charge extra for long nails. I have just a bit longer than average nails with no extra work involved and very little shaping needed. UNBELIEVABLE! I've been getting my nails done for 30 years and this is the first time I've ever heard such a thing. I won't be coming back.,1
"This new place opened up a while back and I was sold when I saw sushi on the sign. We came in last weekend and ordered a large variety of items. Everything was really good and really cheap. Like, really really cheap. Even better. All the food was very fresh and tasty. Since we live so close, I'm sure we'll be back often.",2
"The waitress was really nice. The inside of the place was chic, modern, urban. But at 7 game of bowling during the daylight hours.can't say I'm a fan. You can get people to do almost anything when you're visiting read me , but ever again? Most definitely not. It's a nice change of pace, but I'd rather spend it somewhere else.",1
"I was there twice in the last three days. Encountered I think their manager who was frantically running around the place. I waited over 10 minutes for a simple ice tea. When I questioned that my drink was late and might have been forgotten she said, we're busy. Welcome to Starbucks! In an exasperated tone I would not drive out of my way for that experience again.",1
"I don't think I ever had a bad meal here. I'm not from Hawaii but my fiance say is and he tells me all the time this place is the closest to being straight from home. I am obsess with poke and all the different types, so nothing makes me happy then their poke bar. A bit pricey, but what do you expect when you live in the desert.",2
Have been a regular here off and on over the past several years as my schedule allows. Everything is great and the staff is welcoming. I love the original G sandwich with fruit as a side and a soynami as a treat while I wait for my food or catch up with a friend. It can be busy at lunch and dinner for those who are new. Don't let this discourage you. It's a great place.,2
"When going to this office do not expect a welcome reception from the Medical Assistants that work there. They are cold, indifferent, and very aloof toward patients. The Drs are great but customer service needs improvement immensely. I agree with previous comment that professionals do not exist at this front office.",1
"My husband is a Firefighter and my Son loves this place. Warning! People who work there are RUDE and real grouchy! I do not refer people there strictly due to them. I would not want any of my friends to be treated so poorly. I do take my son just because he is so obsessed with anyting to do with Firefighting. I thought about having his birthday party there, sadly due to the staff changed my mind.",1
"Had to wait for my husband to arrive at Charlotte airport, since I was flying in from a different city. Came to Gardenia cause it was close to airport and rental car company. Best home style southern cooking I've had in a long time! And the prices were on the really inexpensive side. Loved that the waitresses knew the regulars by name!",2
You will freeze to death! The heating didn't work. We complained. They said it would get fixed. Still no heat in our room after two nights. Third night we demanded another room. The ssme issue in the new room. No heat. The nights get cold in the winter here. Don't stay in this hotel unless you are looking for freezing cold rooms! Terrible. The water is not hot either. The interior is outdated.,1
"We went for breakfast and it was overpriced, greasy and service was bad. Don't expect to pay anything less than 20 person for regular breakfast and coffee that you can get at Denny's across the street for less than half the price. There weren't too many people so it was weird that our server looked like she was rushing herself and us .",1
My bf and I go to this location a lot before work. They remember his order more cause he's always in uniform. Other than that it's always packed and such a good vibe. I love how friendly the staff is and the cleanliness. Thanks chipotle! I might just have some for dinner tonight just talking about it lol ,2
"Hmm. Don't know how they have the reviews they do. Food was gross! I got a gyro plain and simple. I assumed it would be awesome since its a greek place. I don't eat the pita itself I eat the insides, there was a few pieces of gyro meat not big pieces with a ton of lettuce. The sauce was really thick not impressed at all. They get two stars cause the drive thru was fast.",1
"I've tried a few times. It's so close, and not as busy as Orgenos I know why service is iffy. Had good had pretty bad. I ask for pizza well done I don't consider it even done. I'd be afraid if it cooked normal. 2 stars because the garlic knots are usually pretty bomb except the time they were cold keep trying.",1
"Had the Cobb Salad in a wrap. It was huge and the price was right. This place is good and I love local and original restaurants. It is primarily a takeout place, but there is an outdoor seating area that is well shaded and has a mist system. Food was good, service was quick, and all in all I am sure to be back.",2
"This place has the WORST service of any pizza place that we've ever tried in Henderson. AVIOD AT ALL COSTS, frozen pizza from your house will be a more pleasurable experience. They outright lie that it's a 20 minute wait, it was an hour. That have four POS terminals with only ONE person working. The staff is all untrained kids, no seasoned supervision.",1
" Jan 2006 We came here really late after watching ""O "" at the Bellagio and waited at the bar for a while before we got a table. Cheap drinks! Tip If you need a cab to get back to your hotel after eating here late night, make sure you ask have the hostess call while you are dining. We had to wait nearly an hour for a taxi to make its way out here to get us. That was ridiculous.",1
"This place was cool , cozy, mood lighting was awesome. The food by far was amazing. AVOCADO FRIES ARE YUMMMMMMMMM AND SECRET DUMPLINGS. The waitress was cool and nice. nThe only problem was the couple nxt to us, they were arguing about non sense and making small scenes go home and do that nOverall i will def. go again.",2
Can I say anything bad about phat burrito? No I can't. Nothing beats a bbq chicken burrito. The food is fresh and flavorful. The salsa bar has a great variety and the service is chill and laid back. Just found out they are serving breakfast now too. nOnly advice I have is try to avoid this place during peak hours. Other than that you're always in for a treat.,2
"Came here to check out whether all the hype is true. Well, I'm happy to say that Lotus of Siam almost lived up to the expectations. nFood is delicious and service is friendly but I always get grossed out by places where they use those big plastic bins to clear tables. Wine list is decent but not as sophisticated as Chada Thai's. nThe bottom line Lotus of Siam is decent but I prefer Chada Thai.",2
"Really ZERO STARS! nI don't know why but they can't get my order right. The order taker gets it right because when I check my receipt, it is correct. The food in the bag is ALWAYS WRONG. My kids like Wendy's but we will not try it again. nI called once because they didn't include one of the meals. Went back to get it and they still messed it up. It's fast food, how hard is it to get right?",1
"Had chocolate vodka and philly sliders! My friend had hot chocolate and spicy chicken sliders and the only thing that was subpar was hot chocolate. It is not one of the cheaper places but happy hour will make your visit worthwhile. Make sure to sit at the bar area for happy hour! I would have to try their other chocolate stuff to give them a fair verdict. For now, max Brenner gets 4 stars.",2
"I've tried LA Fitness, Pure Fitness, and other gyms in the valley. So far i am really liking the 24 Hour Fitness facilities and staff. Pure and LA always seem like meat markets to me, and smaller gyms will just rip you off. This gym never seems too busy and they have decent cardio and weight equipment.",2
"I emailed this review to a manager via Caesar's website, and received essentially no follow up, other than ""thanks for the feedback. "" While I understand that there is no obligation to issue a credit refund, an apology would have been appreciated, particularly as this was a dinner for a special event.",1
"No matter the issue, the problem, their incompetence, or just having to contact them with a question, their employees are THE MOST arrogant, aloof, patronizing, and rude of any Customer Service people I have ever been forced to deal with. It it pure torture to deal with them. To this date, I have never talked to one that doesn't fall into at least two of the categories mentioned above.",1
Unfortunately I went to the store because they advertise themselves as a used rare and collectible book dealer.They are alot of things but they are NOT a collectible or rare bookshop. nThe store is really just a used paperback store. nIf you live within walking distance and the weather is nice then maybe worth a visit.Io way would I waste gas to go there.,1
"Read all the good reviews so I figured I would try it out. I have tried the gyro overcooked and not very good, the chicken shwarama just plain old stuff and not very good, and the jalapeno hummus which was average but the pita with it was like cardboard thin and stale. No way is this place even an average Greek Mediterranean place.",1
"The food was really delicious, the staff was very kind and attentive. I really liked how they served the food to us and the timing of the service was also spot on. I really like the authenticity of the menu and I think that the ambiance is very romantic. I had a very relaxing evening there with my boyfriend.",2
"long line to get in.The draw of this buffet at first was the free champagne mimosa or bloody mary that came with the price Really liked the diversity in the food. You could get sushi, breakfast food, crab legs!, BBQ station, pesto pizza, pork buns, NY steak. Great dessert selection as well. Staff was friendly and attentive. Decor very pretty. Overall, win win.",2
"WOW. what a let down. My very first impression of this place DIRTY. As I opened the menu, my second thought was, ""EXPENSIVE! "" was this ice cream made of gold? I mean, even for Vegas, it was expensive. My husband and I decided to share a sundae. Overpriced, melty, took like 25 minutes. why? It's ice cream, not a beer wellington! Won't be going back.",1
"Grand canyon brewery. need I say more? OK I will! Supports local breweries I saw at least 5 different Arizona breweries on the menu! Drink local! Comedy club is passable at best, shit seating and the host thought he was the main event, but the local talent was OK, I guess? Travis?! was the most memorable, lots of current politics events that were goin on. Review is a bit old.",2
"We found the Corn Flower when we needed catering on short notice. The owner took all the time we needed to taste and select our choices. We've gone back for the amazing burritos and empanadas. The homemade salsa choices are amazing, and don't leave without trying the chili soup! Awesome food and even better service. Skip the fast food Mexican because this is cheaper and much better!",2
"This place right here.Let me tell you, The food is great, the prices even better. I usually get the steak and lobster tail for 9.99 or the 8.99 prime rib dinner. I am never disappointed. normally there is not a long wait. usually 20 minutes at the most. service is pretty fast. This is my go to place!",2
"Been here a few times and overall been a pleasant experience. Everytime we go the place is totally empty, so thats kind of creepy. But the experiences have been good. The kobe chuck ribeye are delicious. Its a fun concept and the prices are fair. Its like playing with your food. Atmosphere costs them a star, but food and service def are worth the trip",2
"Walked in to this place to check it out for our Shepard. No one was up front but all I hear is staff members screaming at the dogs to shut up. God forbid dogs bark. I also heard someone in the back slamming something on the ground to make the dogs stop barking. Needless to say, I didn't wait for anyone and left.",1
"Located at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets South. It's a bit small, but it has a decent selection of toys and the prices were GREAT. We were able to find Octonaut figurines if you don't have kids who watch Disney Jr., don't bother asking what this is that we weren't able to get at home and which were much more expensive online. Win win! Plus the employees were friendly and attentive.",2
I needed a drink so I came here. Service was ok nothing great. Hell the guy was not even happy to be there. Seemed lost really. Drinks are always high priced at the airport but what can you do. food was just ok not even good. Over all food was not good and service not at all what it could be. I wont come here again.,1
Went to the new Hash House A GO GO restaurant and it was quite simply the worst dining experience of my life. Service was glacial and the cold awful food was so slow to arrive I thought I may die of starvation before it arrived. After it arrived I just wanted the meal to end but instead I was raped for the 60 bill. My ass is still bleeding.,1
"Avoid this place. They are just trying to hustle you for more services that you don't really need. nYou don't really need an engine flush unless you spilled contaminants in the engine. Every customer walking in, they are just trying to scam them. nI really wish to save any more people from falling into their trap.",1
"I honestly used to love this place! However the last few times I've ordered to go from there it's as if they just threw all the good together quickly with no care. My cheeseburger was squished and sloppy, the fries were over cooked. My daughters chicken strips were so dry, even with dipping sauce! I won't be coming back!",1
The food was just okay NOTHING special. There's so many other great breakfast places to eat in Arizona! Don't waste your money here especially since you will pay the same amount as you would at a full service restaurant. The idea of waiting in line to order food and having to get your own coffee is not appealing. It makes the breakfast seem even more over priced than it already is! DON'T GO HERE!,1
"We took the tour today with Scout and had a great time, he's very knowledgable about the area and the plants and animals you'll see in the Sonoran desert. It was money well spent. I especially liked that he went slow and we got I see so much of the cacti first hand. Not much walking around and the ride was a bit exciting at times. Would recommend to a friend.",2
"I created my account finally just to make note that this location is one mile away from the hotel I'm staying at downtown Phoenix across from u.s. Airways center and it's ""not in their delivery range "". Between that and the other location that closes at 5 00 on friday and Saturday I'm not really sure how jimmy johns stays in business",1
"Fun place to eat. The staff are so willing to meet your needs, including the effort of making a pizza Taco Pizza that is no longer on the menu. An excellent pizza, I might add. One of the best Taco Pizzas I have had the opportunity to try. Some of the hot wings my hot wing loving family have had. Will be going back very soon!",2
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up. Overcooked tasteless burgers. Dried out chicken breasts. Soggy flavorless fries. The only thing we had worth ordering was the Nutter Butter shake. The shake wasn't enough to save it from the 1 star rating. Might be the worst restaurant burger I have ever had.,1
"I love this bar restaurant. It has a supercool aqua motif, and I love the bartender here she is my favorite! This place has a great raw bar. I love the oysters here, and the atomic sized prawns I had a spicy seafood pasta with arrabiata sauce. It was truly wonderful, spicy, but not overhwhelming. I cannot wait to go back and visit my favorite bartender!",2
My favorite buffet in Vegas. So many good vegetables and meat that I am almost able to control the carb overload that I expect when I see the amazing desserts. This one offers reservations so DEFINITELY plan the day before so you can skip the loooong lines and lengthy waits. You will walk right in with a reservation just like the high rollers.,2
We went specifically so we could try the frozen hot chocolate for dessert but didn't have the room because the portions are huge. I have never seen a bigger BLT. That would have easily satisfied 2 of us. The only cons are the fries they were Luke warm old and the music it was just too loud even for the vibe . Otherwise we can't wait to go back and leave room for the frozen hot chocolate.,2
The cheese pizza was so salty it was inedible. I have to think something has changed or the accidentally dropped the salt shaker on this one. Please check the sodium content on your ingredients Barro's. I hope your reading your reviews and taking this stuff to heart. We have loved supporting this business for the last 10 years .,1
"Mix N Mac is a tasty little spot. The food is made with fresh quality ingredients and there are plenty of flavor options on the me. i went with a basic item ""chessy mac "". made with a sacuse of cheddar and blue chesse. it was good more cheddar then blue but it was a good mix. It took a few minutes to prepare but it was worth the short wait.",2
"It didn't work out for us. We went on Saturday night, about 10 tables, only two people were there eating. Service was not very friendly in my opinion, counting their money. I felt like I was an inconvenience. As far as the food, I find that most Mediterranean food tastes the same not a lot of variety. Baba gounash was good, but overall nothing memorable.",1
"Went here for a quick dinner before a concert at the Cosmo. Made reservations so we wouldn't have to wait. Seated immediately upon arrival, and by the window at that! Great service. April was our server and she was awesome and on top of everything. Will definitely eat here again when I am in Vegas next.",2
Only went here one time but I'm already a fan! Their menu is simple and easy and great for sharing. They have appetizers and small noodle bowls that are good if you want to try a little of each. I had the chiang mai curry which was delish. I love how it came with a layer of crispy noodles on top of the curry noodles. And also.it's BYOB and there's wine store a few mins away. ,2
"I visited in January and thought this place was great! Everyone was really friendly, yeah drinks were poured with care, but still. i got buzzed! I really really reccomend this place. seemed like the least trashiest place and it was at the time! Parking was a little rough but besides that i had a ball. AND SMOKING ON A DECK big plus. I hate smoking outside a door.",2
"I really didn't enjoy my experience. I felt from a beginner level that the routes were poorly planned and the space was poorly utilized with random holds, unmarked. I only bouldered and most of the gym was top ropes so maybe I got a bad taste in my mouth, but I'll shop around before getting a membership.",1
"Good range. On the small side, but clean and new. The staff is all pretty nice, although 1 or 2 of them will have their super cool utility belt with extra mags and handcuffs and whatnot while working. I mean, I'm all for guns and self defense and all that, but really? lol. They provide discounts for police fire ems military.",2
"I like this AM PM for one reason Cheap Gas! This station, along with the location at Decatur Washington, always have the lowest priced gas on the westside of town. It always amazes me that people will stop at the unnamed station a block away and pay 40 cents a gallon more than the same product is sold for at this station.",2
"The major complaint I have about this cafe is GOAT Lamb Meat. The Meat they sell is not at all tender and really hard to cook. Till now I tried 3 times and all 3 times had very bad experience cooking it. The Butcher also does not cut meat chicken very well. never buy Goat Lamb meat here. You will certainly be disappointed, If you buy.",1
I think this is the best fast mexican food in Chandler or the surrounding area. The food quality is high and consistant. The prices are downright CHEAP. I really like the bean and cheese burritos and the chili relleno burritos. The jalapenos and carrots are a must and I am thrilled that they started selling Tamarindo.,2
"While I have always enjoyed Bliss for their incredible facials, I went out on a limb and got a shellac manicure by Michelle today. She was just wonderful! Her personality made the entire service enjoyable. Yes, a gel mani at Bliss will cost you a bit more than a traditional nail salon but I assure you, it is completely worth it! Thanks Michelle, I will be back!",2
"New name, new look, higher prices. Pizza and wings were good before, and they still are. Burgers and chicken Philly nothing special. Prices are inflated for a product that doesn't warrant it. Like I said, the pizza and wings are still great, but 80 bucks for two kids meals, two sandwiches, two lemonades, two beers, and a mixed drink does not make a neighborhood place that I will return to.",1
"Good prices, good service overall good food. Nothing fancy but I thought it was all pretty good! We were in a group of 8 were seated quickly. Shortly after we ordered the food started coming out they kept it coming as we made room! They cleaned up empty dishes quickly for our leftovers to go quickly as well.",2
"Jen is amazing, everyone should go to her. She is friendly and cuts great hair. She has been cutting mine for the last 1 2 years, and I never have an issue. Too bad she is a RAIDERS fan. She also cuts my sons hair which always turns out excellent. I just wish she would change her days off to better suite my schedule, I'm off almost the same days she is. Lol",2
"Typical Montreal greasy spoon. The service from the waitress was great and quick, to burger was the expected mediocre. The biggest problem was the poutine. I love poutine, and never I mean NEVER should it be grated cheese instead of curds. Get a clue, you are THE? greasy spoon in St. Henri, get some curds.",1
I had high hopes since I had been to Bambu in the Bay Area. The drinks were quite watery and not tasty. I'm hoping that they'll get better at creating the desserts since they just opened. Parking lot is also tiny so you might have to park in the side street. On the plus side K pop videos kept me entertained!,1
"Came to this Walmart today and loved it, they have a full stocked variety of stuff at least compared to the Walmart I usually go to on Ft. Apache. I went to several party supply stores to find Doc McStuffins theme supplies and if I would have known, I definitely would of came here first because they have a variety of her items and IN STOCK!",2
"Excellent. Got fried chicken with fries and garlic bread. Fries were perfect. Chicken was moist, not greasy at all, and the panko very tasty. Got sweet chili and BFG sauce. Sweet chili was so good, haven't made it to the BFG. Very cheap, not even 7 with tax. For what it is, this place has it figured out. Really friendly customer service. I will definitely be back and bringing friends this time.",2
Below average bar food. This place advertises that they are a restaurant but the menu is limited and the food is terrible. I'm sure it would be fun to come with a group on the weekend but do not come for lunch or dinner. 27 for 2 and I would have rather had the McDonald dollar menu. Service was good and staff was nice though.,1
"After eating the Margaritaville in New Orleans, this one is OK. Interesting decor sitting in the fishing boats unless you have to sit up front instead of on the back. Good photo ops and Cheeseburger in Paradise is good but Fat Burger is better in my humble opinion. Tourists love it, locals meh, I've had better.",1
"I went here for brunch lunch to try something different from bacchanal. Biggest mistake of my life. A lot of it was undercooked. I really felt like I was at Hometown Buffet typical pizza, wings, disgusting mac n cheese, weird mash potatoes, non tender meat, and cereal. Currently in the toilet trying to flush it out of my system. notimpressed",1
"I went in for a phone and they had the best deals I could find. Great customer service and very professional. The employees knew what they were talking about and answered all my questions. Normally I don't like going into electronic stores but the people there made it fun, always joking and being very friendly. I really recommend this store, I'm definitely going back. D",2
Horrible service. A five dollar sub. And one thin piece of turkey and one thin slice of bacon. I thought the turkey was a piece of cheese. The avacado is a spread. They don't tell you that either. Best thing was the bread. Worst sub I've ever had. Rude teenyboppers running the store. Won't buy again. If I could give it no stars.,1
"Excellent food at great prices. I hadnt been there in years but found it again this past weekend and the food is still just as good as ever and the portions are just as gigantic as ever. Also one of the few places that still have Stuffed Hot Banana Peppers. If you get the crab balls, order them with the honey mustard dipping sauce.",2
"Although the store is a little cluttered always when you walk in, the last time I went I bought a snowboard for my boyfriend and the service was awesome! The guys were so nice and even with it being so busy during Christmas season, they ordered my board and it was the easiest process ever. I highly recommend this store for snowboarding gear!",2
"My greatest memory of this place is when the Ludacris song, How Low Can You Go, was playing. The moment it started, the entire club dropped to the floor. I can literally see all the way to the other side of the club. Other than that, this place was average. High prices, small place, sectioned seating area, expensive drinks. Vegas price tag without the Sin City glitz.",1
Absolutely the worst customer service. I had to be put on medical leave and had a note from my doctor which ended up to be a complete headache. They told me the wrong info over the phone for cancellation. When I went into the club they were rude. If you are going to spend the money I would just go to the village. They at least take care of their members.,1
"Wow! This food is delicious! I've eaten at plenty HI places in Vegas this is by far the best. It's a family owned business, it feels like eating at a friends house. I had garlic chicken spare ribs mixed plate. Ahhhmazzing though pricy 15 it's so worth it if you don't mind spending the extra 4 in comparison to other HI places. Very filling tasty. I'll be back soon!",2
"I love the food here and on a nice day, there is nothing better than eating it outdoors. The combos are great. On my last visit I had the oversized fish sandwich. It was good, but the bun was dry and stale. I wish I'd ordered the oyster sandwich, but next time. They have great slaw and fries and the staff were very friendly and accomodating. Love it!",2
"This place is a hidden gem! The staff is so incredibly friendly and the restaurant is very clean. Now, for the Pho, this is the first place that I have ever had it, and I am absolutely a fan. I love the spicy pho with extra veggies, it is so yummy. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves Pho, because you will love this place. They are closed Tuesdays, just a heads up.",2
Very nice place. Too nice to have diner in the name. Very classy. The calamari was awesome and the crab cake sandwich was good. Friend had patty melt she said was awesome. The fries were awesome shoestring type. The classy atmosphere had a classy price but I would definitely go again when in the area.,2
"I would love to give this place three stars because the service is pretty darn good. But the food is just sub par compared to the other choices in Madison. I had a combination platter of a burrito, taco, and tostada. It was very bland and didn't seem to have much flavor at all. I would compare this place to a restaurant like Pedro's. It's Fast, Cheap, and just OK.",1
"If you go to get wild, which is the only reason to go, be sure to get the puke insurance. That way, if when you puke on the bar, they won't kick you out! If you think I am joking, go there and see for yourself. If you get the puke insurance, ask the bartender to make you a glass of ass juice. That way, you will get the most out of your experience and the insurance won't go to waste.",2
We were craving pho and got excited to find this place nearby. As soon as we walked in we noticed the very unpleasant blue lighting inside and when we were about to be seated we noticed a very foul smell that was overwhelming and disgustingly pungent. We couldn't even make it to our table before turning around and leaving.,1
"well, sometimes ""little hole in the wall "" places are very good and tend to surprise you. but not this place. The service was good and friendly, but the food was horrible. The orange juice tasted very bad, the gravy on the biscuits tasted like flour and water paper mache the bacon and mushroon omlet had a bad after taste. skip this place and go to ihop.",1
"ER is quick, attentive, friendly, THOROUGH, Private room given.Literally waited 5 minutes only to get seen. Admitted for 4 days and the room was clean, ALL STAFF were marvelous, friendly and the food was not bad at all. If there was anyone sick in my family I will gladly use this hospital. Dr's are nice and follow up thoroughly!",2
"Horrible service host and waitress barely spoke English. The hibachi chef had to clean dishes from the table as he was cooking because the waitress was nowhere to be found. We had to wait 15 minutes after asking twice for drink refills. Food was good, but overall it was a very bad dining experience. Worst hibachi joint in the Vegas area.",1
"I wasn't very impressed. I don't think Phoenix has a lot to choose from when it comes to malls and outlet deals. So if you're on vacation or visiting from out of state, do your shopping at home. I spent way more than I intended which means I did find some things to buy but they were all more than I expected from an outlet.",1
"So good! We went for the first time tonight. Between us, we had a cheese quesadilla, veggie tacos, a mini chicken taco, a carnitas burrito, beans, chips with salsa and watermelon aqua fresca. Everything was delicious and fresh. It's like Los Tacos, but better! Also the restaurant is clean and newly refurbished. My son and husband both enjoyed it and we will be back.",2
"Most dissatisfying hair cutting experience ever. Went in asking for a long and typical layered look but came out with a short, blunt and jagged cut. Pino speaks very highly of himself and his work but in actuality the service he provided was the opposite. I will not be returning nor would I recommend anyone else to do so either.",1
"This place is bumpin on the weekends. Great place to shop for groceries or have lunch. They grill outside, have all kinds of hot entrees inside and a delectable array of pastries. Not to mention the hot off the press corn tortillas. Know your Spanish when you go, not very many of the staff speak English.",2
"I have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. nThe ""Chile Verde Birdie "" is my favorite sandwich. There is a very wide variety of items on the menu to suit any taste. nThe service is always very good, polite and welcoming. They always have great music playing! Today was a very jazzy selection of Christmas songs! nYou cannot go wrong here!",2
"Over rated. Bad service and expensive food. I ordered shrimp on linguine and it was dry, under cooked and not tasty. Serving size is small even for dinner. Price is high, and not even delicious which makes it not worth it. There are many other good restaurants in Venetian Plazzo, try others but not B B.",1
"Very good service and very good food. The place is nicely decorated and the whole meal is affordable. The food is very tasty and very well cooked. As a French, my only regret was on the chicken although the sauce was very tasty, I believe that the quality of the meat was rather poor. But I guess it is complicated to find a good ""poulet fermier "" free range chicken in the US ",2
Nice casual bar located in the Aria hotel. To be honest I went here thinking it actually had a view across the city! Still a good find and it's a nice open bar with plenty of seating and some great drinks. Just a word of warning the free snack include wasabi peas. didn't realise what they were at first but they made us go through our drinks pretty quick when we did!,2
"Admittedly, I don't buy much when I visit Bunky, because I am a cheap bastard, but I do drool quite a bit. Cute cute clothes from independent and local designers. If you don't mind spending some hefty bucks on your wardrobe, Bunky can help and you'll look fantastic. Bunky makes me wish I weren't such a tightwad.",2
Terminal 3 has got to be the worst terminal at Sky Harbor. Not 1 store was open and it was only 10 30pm. There is only 1 vending machine and it had no water! We are in the desert right? The staff was completely rude and not helpful! If I never come back to this airport it will be too soon. Stay away.,1
"As a regular, I am disappointed at this location. I feel there are a lot of hidden price increases here compared to what they personally advertise. Look at the menu long enough and check your receipt and you'll often see that the prices don't match or what they advertise . Grrrrrr n. And apparently this location advertises the kitchen closes at midnight when clearly they close it much earlier .",1
We wanted to eat there today. Waited for about 10 minutes at the entrance. No hostess coming up. Then she shows up saying that she will be back in another second. After additional 5 minutes we ask her what's going on. She did not apologize and says that it will take another 30 minutes. Really?! Not the nice way to treat a party of 4 wanting to spend some money.,1
"Awesome decor. This place puts Mel's Diner back home in LA to shame. But bring a sweater they had the AC ridiculously cold in there! All in all a great experience, though, and I will be back and recommend this place to others. Loved the atmosphere and the food was pretty good.with lots leftover to take back to the hotel with us!",2
"Old school American style Chinese food at its best. The decor is straight out of the restaurant in ""A Christmas Story "" and the service staff is similar, as well. The kung pao beef is exceptional as is the fried wonton appetizer. Great place to go with a small to mid size group, as everything is family style and the servings are good size.",2
the school is very structured an very key on great education.it's def worth the 22k a year per child plus all the other fees.starts from pre k through high school so no worries about wondering if your kids won't be happy when they go to the next grade.only thing that sucks is pick up.you need to be at least 30 mins early prior to dismissal ,2
"Not the best BBQ I've ever had but coming from the south, this was still pretty good. Small space and short staffed but good food and good prices. Fun outdoor seating for people watching. Split a three meat combo with family and it was a lot of food. Good texture, nice sauces. I'll be back for ribs next time!",2
"This place can't be beat in the downtown area in terms of creative, yummy food, relaxed atmosphere, and fair prices. I've sampled about half of the menu, and while the red curried noodles and veggies wasn't really spicy enough for me, I've otherwise thoroughly enjoyed everything! The gypsy stew is probably what comfort food tastes like in heaven.",2
"muy mal servicio del taquero.un se u00f1or canoso viejo enojon.y muy mal humorado.con voz de enojo y de descontento te preguntava cuantos, en lo que pensabas k mas pedir te decia en tono grotesco.cuantos en total quieres no puedo estar picando de pokito.esta a un lado del otro taquero k prepara solo los de pastor.no vayan.muy mal servicio",1
"WHAT A DIFFERENCE from the Chandler location to the Snottsdale location! The food is still unbelievably good, but here it comes with prompt service, accurate orders and fresh showered, healthy vibrant looking employees. After this weekend I think I'd be happy to drive the 45 minutes to this location rather than the five minutes to the Chandler location for my Pita Jungle fix.",2
"I used to love this place. But it seems that service is getting worse and worse by the day. nThere's one chef that seems to have an attitude every time I see him chubby with glasses . nThey take forever to make your order when you order too much, they don't serve it. nOnly good thing about this place is the fact that you can order more than 1 uni sashimi at this place.",1
"Went here with a Groupon. Sure, the d u00e9cor was not that great, but the food and service was really good. I found the servers to be pleasant and attentive. We each had a chicken dish. The TIka Masala and Vindaloo were tasty. The prices seemed reasonable. I would probably return, however the Groupon was what got us there. I would say it was a good experience.",2
"This location is a relatively newer location. I just to go to the power location, but this one is a little closer for me. I like this one much more than the other location service is always good. Sometimes the line can be long but they usually go through it pretty well. Besides that salad bowls are always awesome.",2
Service very slow. Food was gross blood dripping from beef sliders . Never saw waitress one time after food was dropped. When I asked for it to be removed from the bill she got very angry so I asked that the manager handle my table she got even more angry. So no food for me as it took so long to even get someone to see how bad food was. Oh well will not ever go back.,1
Get rid of the bums hanging out like it's their new home and I'll up the stars to 4. Prices are really good much lower than walgreens for sundries like toothpaste and I buy Epsom salts here for 3 compared to 5 or more elsewhere. Their pork chops are so fresh and tasty I don't know where they buy them but soooo good. Good prices small selection.,1
"The show is enjoyable especially if you are a Beatles fan. To quote the Frommers Guide ""The show is a bit thin on plot not unlike many Cirque productions. "" It was quite a spectacle and you leave smiling. There were several people a few rows in front of us who kept moving around during the show and I found that distracting and was disappointed that the ushers didn't do anything about it.",2
"I adding this as a 5 stars cause Subway is a Subway, if you are into the subs they taste just as good as any other location, they are not greedy on meat or toppings and the 5 stars comes as this location is now open 24 hours! You are going to find people who dont enjoy where they work anywhere you go in the food industry.",2
Sad to be leaving Charlotte.especially when I've finally found a jewel of a neighborhood coffee shop such as this in a city full of Starbucks and less so now Caribou. Came in and ordered the moose mocha everything about it was great. Rich tasting coffee with great caramel flavor. Very warm and inviting interior as well. Will definitely be back.,2
"might be one of the best burgers i've ever had. then again, since you make your own, it's your fault if it sucks. Burger Bar offers great, high end burger options jalepeno bacon, three different aiolis, and truffle sauce to boot. this place is a great find. the portions are huge so sharing is a good option, especially if you want to save room for a shake!",2
"I love Dunning's. When I want a good burger, this is the place I visit. Even when they're busy, I can count on getting my burger the way I ordered it. The portions are HUGE. The downside is that this place can be noisy and the wine prices are too high for a 4 ounce pour. Otherwise, the service is good, the food consistent, and the atmosphere pleasant for a neighborhood pub.",2
Found this place because of yelp and I thought I might like it. Atmosphere is not stuffy at all and I can't rave about their Le Chevreuil Grand Veneur dinner and the Amuse Bouche. Been back a few times and always enjoy my meal and our service was all you would want it to be. If you love French food this is a place to go!,2
"Sakana, used to be excellent. But they have changed management and now the fish seems older and the food is always prepared late into the meal. It is amazing how the wrong people can really ruin a great restaurant. nYou used to have to wait for a table, no you can walk in anytime and get a table right away.",1
"Good food, great atmosphere and super cool owner! Very spacious and the patio is a nice hangout. The menu is quite extensive, so you should be able to find something if a burger and wings is not your thing. The Cobb is my favorite salad. It is huge and full of meat and cheese. New Year's resolution to go more in 2015.",2
"I will never ever go back. The very worst service we've ever had in Phoenix. Beyond slow. Totally disorganized and ultimately owner fairly rude. Food was up and down. Hanger steak and fries good, chicken good both maybe 3 star but beef bourguignon was way way over cooked. There is simply nothing to recommend this place.",1
Awesome food with decent drinks. They have better drinks than Taiwan express but the menu is allot smaller. I highly recommend Lollicup if you like Chinese food that doesn't taste like glorified Panda Express. Whenever I go It's patrons are usually all speaking Chinese which is how I gauge food authenticity. More native patrons equals more authentic food.,2
I usually eat here once a week. Everyone is very nice and accommodating. My favorite roll is LA Boxing with a fresh slice of very thin lemon on top. Yummy! The food is great and staff is fun to spend lunch with. I never order my drink anymore because the waitress knows my order! Love sushi and this is my favorite.,2
"This place is average at best. The ambience is good for watching games and as a social Hang. Their prices are too expensive for anything I ordered. Below average food, under poured drinks. When your a vegas local in hospitality you don't wan to feel like your getting ripped off for drinks and cheap food.",1
I was here St. Patrick's Day night. What a disappointment. The piano player was playing. The minute we walked in he quite. The place felt like a morgue. So boring. The waiter was polite but acted like he didn't want to be there. The pizza was dry. The rest of the food was o.k. but it just wasn't like it use to be.,1
"1 Wine took 30 minutes to get to the table n2 Waiter was more interested in himself and did a poor job representing the menu. n3 Plates left on the table too long. n4 Steak was bland and had no flavor, I asked for A1. Do not believe the hype. This restaurant did not live up to the reviews. I rather eat a Slim Jim than pay for a tasteless 70 steak.",1
"Been there numerous times always made excuses for their poor customer service. Today was the absolutely last time, after speaking with the own being told I had the option to take my business elsewhere. I'm local I'll take my business elsewhere from now on. It's not just about having good food if your attitude tastes like crap. Good luck with your establishment.",1
"We tried Gelato 69 or whatever it is that opened on the NE corner of Dobson and Warner. No way it can compare to Angel Sweet. Angel Sweet puts them to shame. The staff is more than willing to let you sample a variety of flavors. My only gripe make the Valentine's special, Hugs and Kisses, part of the regular offerings. I LOVE IT.",2
"Came here for a work conference. And had an open bar free drinks for a good couple hours! It was awesome. I had the bacon wrapped dates! Boy were they good. The salmon bruschetta was ok, so were the chicken skewers. Sad, I didn't get to try the poutine duck confit fries or the bone marrow, but that's on my food to try list next time!",2
"I came here to watch Date Night last week and had a craving for some Sour Strawberry Belts. As I was filling up my bag, I could tell that they were old because they were hard. When I went up to pay, I made a comment to the cashier about the candy being old and hard. He just ignored me and said, ""that will be 7.20. "" I figure he probably hates his job so I left it at that.",1
"This place is pretty decent! Delicious brisket and generous side portions. For someone who's paleo, having the option of having two heaping sides of collard greens rather than being saddled with french fries and potato salad is a welcomed change. The jerky was meh. My fiance totally dug his cobbler, though. When I'm in the area again, I'll definitely make another stop.",2
"Not much to see here. The food was very bland, and the service was slow. We went on off hours around 4 00 and the food still took a long time. To top it off, the waitress didn't come back to take our credit card for 15 minutes. We just about got up and walked out. The place wasnt the cleanest, either.",1
Okay being spoiled for so long was completely disappointed yesterday at the wash. I had to go back over the car with a rag right there in front of them. was bullshit that I was having to clean my own fucking car at the car wash. I could have went to the cheapy place over by my house and got a better wash for half the price. Still pissed! Hand job indeed!,1
"My husband and I stopped by to get a sandwich one afternoon. The small shop smelled great, I had great customer service and the food was good! I read some of the other comments and all I can say is maybe they were having a bad day. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I felt the prices where a little higher than it should be. The Spinach Feta bread was awesome! It is a must try.",2
"So I had no idea this place was so close to me nor that it existed. I got the smokey crepe, which was turkey chorizo Gouda and avocado. It was so delicious! Staff was very friendly. They gave us on the house granola and two little toasted rose marshmallows with dark chocolate sauce. nEnjoyed the atmosphere, felt unique. Next time I'll try the coffee and baked goods! nAs well as a dessert crepe.",2
"So disappointing after reading some positive reviews I was anxious to give them a try. From ice cold, mushy Mexican corn to cold, strangely seasoned chicken tacos. nOne redeeming item was my husbands cheeseburger. It was hot and the burger itself was juicy. We ate the burger and threw away the rest.",1
"The best conference facilities I have been to in Phoenix. Parking can get tight as another poster mentioned, but I think that is unavoidable. The food is fantastic and they have snacks and drinks available during the day. I don't like the tiny cups water jugs to drink from. I understand eliminating plastic bottles, but the cups they provide are too small. Really a minor inconvenience though.",2
"Waited 30 minutes to get our food. This is counter service and it was 7pm on a Thursday, so in my opinion, that's crazy. It wasn't even busy, either. Once we got our food I got the chicken burrito with a side of beans it was rather bland. My hubby got a tamale, which was pretty much all masa and no beef. Only good part of this restaurant was the salsa.",1
"This place has some of the best chicken wings. I go there a lot for lunch and order the ""Bonzless "" with honey bar b que sauce. I've also taken the family and the kids love 'em. And we all know how kids can picky about food. They have a variety of sauces from mild to damn hot. And they got some great chili there too.",2
"Been here a few times in the last couple years. Always solid and never had a problem. Very cute date spot, actually the bf took me here on our first date, big points! I recommend the capricciosa sp? pizza and a nutella crepe with strawberries. Parking is off the street and there will probably a wait, but it will be worth it",2
"I get it. it's the HEART ATTACK Grill however the burgers are disgustingly greasy. I love a good burger but one drenched in a pool of grease? I think not. Dressing in hospital gowns was unique and seemed fun until I realized people were getting an intense spanking with a wooden paddle for not finishing their food. I had a bite of the ""single bypass burger "" and called it quits. Never again.",1
"Great new restaurant in Phoenix! The atmosphere is laid back and very cool. The service was fantastic and the food was excellent. We tried a good mix of items the rock shrimp, corn and butternut squash enchiladas, roasted brussel sprouts, osso buco, veggie tower and chicken and dumplings. Everything was great including the delicious bread!",2
"Probably not the best nail place I've been too just because the place didn't seem that clean. Needs major work! I went here to get my nails done since it is right where I live and most of the nail salons I go to are in the Southwest of town totally worth the drive after seeing this place . Anyway, I got a French Manicure, it wasn't bad. Ehh overall, I don't think I'd recommend this place.",1
We came for Christmas Eve and had a spectacular meal. The service was attentive but relaxed. We were not rushed through our meal as the other reviews indicated. We would highly recommend the guacamole by the table and the glazed pork belly appetizer. Margaritas were delicious. A wow experience. I wish we lived around here so we could experience it again.,2
"The food was ok had grilled pork sandwich which wasn't like any other grilled pork that I was expecting. It was just grilled ham. However, terrible service, I have to say. Had to wait and remind the waitress what food we ordered and then wait again. The manager was very rude. Not coming back unless I have to for any other reason.",1
My first time coming here and it was amazing. Awesome service. Super fast. Clean! One of the friendliest genuinely happy staffs. Not to mention the food was delicious. Fresh and very filling. Fries were hot crispy and nicely salted. Burger was charbroiled to perfection and super juicy. Thanks for the awesome experience! Highly recommend this place!,2
"Using dance and sensuality as its medium, Cirque's Zumanity explores the complexities of human behavior thoughtfully and provocatively. To me, the scenes seem more inquisitive than conclusive and paint a vivid but tasteful image of eroticism. The performers demonstrate an incredible mastery of their bodies as they explore experiences of innocence, connection, desire and even fetish. Well done.",2
Old Navy has the best sales! Even when I'm not shopping the sales racks they have great deals on cute casual clothes. I think the quality of their clothes is also really great compared to most cheap and cheaply made clothes. A great place to pick up some summer essentials without breaking the bank! nWhy not pick up those flip flops in every color imaginable?,2
"I been to a lot of Thai Restaurant here in Vegas. And yet this place is my number one choice! I absolutely love the service and the food is great! I always get spicy basil chicken fried rice with yellow chicken curry! The seafood tom yum is on point! Papaya salad is decent, cause my mom makes the best so I can't compare. Other then that this place is so worth it!",2
"I like this place, And the staff is nice.They do get busy at times,So you may have to wait or be here for a little longer.Most dentist offices That I've been to get busy, so I understand if I wait a little longer than usual. nI would give them 5 stars but since they can get backed up I give them 4 star raiting.I hope this info can be helpful",2
"Because I only come here when I am passing through the Madison area, I cannot comment on the produce. But! nYay for alternative diets and local foods and bulk options and community and Just Coffee! Sometimes the prices are on par with Whole Foods, sometimes they are lower. All in all, I love you, Willy St. Co op!",2
"Terrible.TERRIBLE! Zero customer service. ""Dan "" manager? service manager? was particularly unhelpful. If they don't want to provide customer service they should stay in the mail order business. Try Landis, Slippery Pig or Focus for service. Buy parts at Beyond Bikes, Jensen or Chain Love, forget these bozos.",1
Every time I go hear it is so packed with screaming children and a 30 minute wait. As horrible as it sounds I would rather have a burger from i out. Its just fine. Nothing that special. You go there for like a quick meal wheothing else is open. It's good. Good French fries. Just can't get the pasted the screaming children.,1
"This place was ok, not great and not my type of burger. I went because I purchased a groupon. The patty reminded me of a Wendys patty, thin and small. Unlike the ones pictured on the menu. Two of the three people in our party had mistakes with their order so when you add that to the lackluster food you can understand why I wouldn't return not even with another groupon offer .",1
"One of the best french bakeries in Montreal. A very large selection of french baked goods from croissant, tarts, and different types of bread. In addition they make amazing giant American style cookies in variety of flavors that are chewy and not too sweet . The cafe also makes great coffee drinks too. They have shops in multiple locations.",2
"omg it's so FUNNY to have a restaurant that pokes fun at rednecks lol! ""Redneck refridgerator 6 miller cans in a cooler "" Screw you. People flock to this place to eat garbage and sit outside. It's these type of people that ruin the food culture of pgh. While the food isn't absolute swill it's not worth more than 2 stars. durr.",1
Very nice and romantic atmosphere! It's very pleasant and the service is excellent. Be sure to do the wine pairing! I recommend sitting on the patio during the cooler months . The inside is very small. You'll probably drive right by it.it's tucked away and very private! They're basically behind some hedges. Highly recommended.,2
"Very, very poor service on Christmas Day! Perhaps it's our fault for thinking that if an establishment is open, they will have enough staff. The one guy got very surly when we asked for sugar for our hot tea that had grown cold! Our food waited on the kitchen counter and got cold before we received it. The food was not even mediocre. No stars at all!",1
"I love this place! I stop here after my rides with friends for breakfast breakfast tacos are delicious . I love to meet people here for meetings over coffee because it's not Starbucks. Have had many items from the menu and can't say I've had anything bad. The Mac Cheese was especially good! The staff is friendly and the manager is great! Try this place, if you haven't already.",2
"Great juicy burgers served steaming hot. The staff is very friendly too! My favorite is the mushroom swiss burger. Its loaded with mushrooms they certainly dont cheap out and the price is great considering its a huge burger with fries, too. The shoestring fries are awesome. Love this place! Its my new favorite!",2
"The food was okay, but not spectacular. They charge a set price for kids and adults both, so we had to pay 50 a pop for our 4 year old, 6 year old, and 8 year old. They stopped making sushi around 8, which sucked. Our server was also extremely rude and impatient, which made our subpar dinner tense and uncomfortable. All in all, wouldn't come back, but food was okay.",1
"I enjoyed two trips to Firefly while visiting Las Vegas recently for a conference. Our group of three had an especially pleasant experience on a Friday for lunch. Our group of 8 found the restaurant to be surprisingly loud on a Monday night, but maybe that's just Vegas at night. Both times, though, the tapas were yummy and the service good.",2
"This is my favorite Starbucks before or after my volunteer shift Levine Children's Hospital. nGranted parking is extremely limited, usually I hit the after church crowd on Sundays. nThe Baristas are quick, friendly make my grande skinny caramel macchiato perfectly! nI love the layout of the shop, too. Nice, long tables ""bar type "" seating.",2
"Kann mich meinem Vorredner anschliessen. Das war jetzt mein dritter Inder. Einmal in K u00f6ln, in Ettlingen und in Durlach. Der in K u00f6ln war ein richtiger Inder. Klein, Familienbetrieb, alles Handgemacht und da war der kick da. Das Maharani bietet gutes indisches Essen an. Mir kam es jedoch etwas u00fcberteuert vor. Trotzdem gerne wieder.",2
"Expected more than the service and food that was provided especially being in Planet Hollywood! Service was ok but food was undercooked and did not meet the taste of churascarrias like Texas or others! I passed up Samba at the Mirage to come here, I am sure I missed out and will be hitting up the Mirage next time we are in Vegas!",1
"Great idea. Badly executed. Queue to get in. Queue to get beer. Queue for a seat. The tent is big, but full with people looking to get a bierhalle Oktoberfest experience, which in my opinion was hard to find. No schlagers, no dancing maidens. Blearing wedding party songs. Food was warm. Beer was cold. That's it. no atmosphere. shame, I really wanted to enjoy it.",1
"Pigs Pinot, a great night out at the Living Room wine bar. This was Living Room's grand opening celebration and was a big event to say the least. Wine vendors everywhere giving samples, live music and Every COUGAR in The Chandler Ocotillo Arizona area Out On The Hunt! We had a blast drinking and watching! GRRRR!",2
"I used to go here all the time, went back recently and they have upgraded their presentation of how they serve your food if you eat in. The sandwiches are still just as good. I always get their half sandwich and half salad. The pizzitis are good tasting, you just don't get a lot for your money if you are hungry. Great spot for lunch!",2
"Fantastic. nThe two of us went there on a Saturday 6pm withought booking, which wasn't a problem, they gave us two hrs which was fine, we had 5 tapas to start and the paella for 2 which was great with 2 Btls wine u00a367. staff are very friendly and nothings to much bother, a great atmosphere too. Enjoy.",2
Seriously the worst bar service in Madison. I can't get over the fact how such a great place can't either get good help or isn't willing to hire a manager to teach their staff how to be attentive and a little more courteous. The food is great. If you're willing to spend two hours waiting for a drink and then asking the server three times if your table is ready.,1
"Had a groupon for this place so thought we would try it out.got the medium buffalo wings and they were perfect.big wings with just the right amount of sauce and kick. We ended up getting the Mediterranean pizza on the thick whole wheat crust with chicken added.was really good and huge. Great atmosphere and very clean, nice waitstaff . Another good pizza joint in Central Phoenix.",2
"This has got to be one of my favorite Sephoras because it's HUGE. There's lots of space to look around products, and there's more selection, I think, of everything. And if you love Make Up Forever, you'll love this location since there was a huge area just dedicated to their products. There's also lots of staff to help you find whatever you need.",2
Good place overall.not too expensive either. nThis is probably the best place at MGM to go for lunch. The gumbo here is spectacular and so is the lobster bisque. nFor dessert i strongly recommend the banana cream pie.one of the best i've ever had! If you're in vegas and craving a taste of New Orleans this is the place to go!,2
"We went there with friends. The service was very poor. They brought the wrong dessert for my friend and the hot chocolate that I ordered turned to gel io time. My husband ordered a spicy chocolate drink. The spice was listed as cinnamon, etc. which sounded good but it was really awful. nAt the end, they practically asked us to hurry because others were waiting to sit down. I will not go back.",1
No sweet n sour on the chicken. Also no veg in the fried rice. Curry was water and no flavor and few carrot and lots potato lil chicken. Plus the salad taste like needs a wash. Spring rolls were the highlight and that isn't saying a thing at all. Overall just a bad experience and when we tried to pay. No cards only cash and no ATM almost just left and wish we had. Never again,1
"Best place for pizza as a dairy free, gluten free person. The one time my mother and I had an issue with service our waitress forgot to bring buffalo sauce until after we finished eating and we couldn't find her while we were eating we received a free dessert without asking. They are very quick with take out too. And their happy hour is amazing!",2
"Royale burger is big, greasy, cheesey, oniony and perfect in almost every way after a couple of long nights in Vegas or probably before a couple of long nights in Vegas for that matter too! . Better than average beer selection and plenty of seating make this a cool spot. I had the fries and they were only ok. Everyone on here seems to like the onion rings so I will try those next time.",2
"The room was nice, we were in the new suites, however. The pool is amazing love the lazy river! The downside to staying here is that the parking garage is so far away from where you check in and get to the rooms let alone how far it is from the strip! It took us about 15 minutes to get from our room in the Grand Tower to the bridges to get to either the Tropicana or NYNY and we are quick walkers.",2
"Excellent high quality eats in downtown Pittsburgh. Great location, with excellent design. Service at the bar is great. Locally sourced produce and meats make this a must when visiting downtown. I had the seafood sambler.and requested a side of th roasted sweet potatoes. Heavenly. Great wine a selection as well.",2
"Got some sushi for take out, and I have to say it doesnt compare in flavor to several other places in the Valley I have gone to, and the price is higher. and when I asked for some extra eel sauce, the chef acted like I had asked for his first born! And then put about 1 teasoon of sauce in a little plastic cup Gee thanks! total bummer because this place is super close to me.",1
"Stayed at the Flamingo tried the Buffet. Wasn't impressed, food did not taste like good quality. 19.99 a person without alcohol is kinda pricey for a mediocre buffet. Food was lack luster, I went back for seconds to get my moneys worth but really wasnt into the taste of the food. Caesars has a way better one for 1 more! Save your money and go somewhere better",1
I really wouldnt have given this place a start but i had to in order to post my review. over priced. we got in for free but i sure in hell wouldnt pay to get into that club nover crowded. nway too many stairs. nthe attendents that work there are all clueless to anything thats going on. nmusic is ok they say this is 1 in vegas? i say go somewhere else. you arent missing much.,1
Have visited several times and that will be my last. I don't think they have cleaned the floors since they opened. The chairs don't work and were sticky. This is definitely not the place for the OCD and it makes me wonder about the tools. Not to mention I could have painted my nails better than this ,1
"Most creative and talented young female! Looking for a new look OR just trying to add to your style, look no further. . You won't be disappointed w Miss Tabitha. Profesional and committed to assuring your contentness. nThx babe for treating me like a Queen, I will send clients your way, knowing they'll get the up most amazing treatment by yourself. .",2
"What happened Boston Market? You used to have a nice nutritious meal at a great price point. Now, portions are very skimpy, veggies are limp, turkey is full of gristle and, worst of all your gravy is horribly watered down. Still a notch above other fast food but, what happened? C'mon, you can tell us.",1
"I loved Postino. I was feeling a little unsure as I walked in. Its a wine bar, can they really have great food? The answer is yes! I loved the outdoor atmosphere especially on this warmer winter day. The staff was friendly and accommodating. It was great for lunch. The service was quick and I never had to ask for a refill. I will definitely be back!",2
"Dry tasteless salmon. And.we waited 20 minutes for this fish, without any drinks.because the waitress forgot what we ordered. n Gosh and I was so starved after the long drive, and this place appeared to look good. n Nice waitress.but she forgot everything everyone ordered several times. She forgot the drinks and silverwear. I used the silverware from another table.",1
Recently enjoyed a great meal while celebrating our wedding anniversary. The staff made our experience so memorable complete with photograph of the happy occasion. The welcoming taste of hors d'oeuvres was just right. Our entrees cooked to an excellent temperature. And the sampler plate of desserts with happy anniversary was such a nice touch.,2
"Came here for lunch one day and ordered tacos for lunch. The tacos themselves were just ok nothng too spectacular. The sides rice and beans were dry and i didnt care for them all that much. The chips and salsa that get were sadly probably the high point of the meal. For the price, this place is a bit over priced. I had hopes for this restaurant but was disappointed.",1
"I can't believe I forgot to write a review about my 2nd favorite show in Vegas! This is an incredible show that blows away Blue Man. Its more primal, real, and just completely mind blowing. How the heck does someone imagine this and then make it come to fruition? There's no excuse not to see this show! Even the cheap seats are good enough.",2
Amazing Show! Very Sexy! Took my mom for her 60th birthday we had a lot of fun! The men were great and the entire atmosphere was so much fun! I recommend it for any occasion! I am sooo coming back because it was perfect! And it's really not that expensive for the quality of the show! It's worth the money and the guys defiantly know what they are doing!,2
"What a fucking joke. Book a room in the west tower and get here to find that they OVERBOOKED so they stick my ass in the manor lodge that is less expensive, without refunding the difference. I WAS a frequent guest at this hotel, staying here every couple of months but after this stunt, that will not be happening again. This is how you treat loyal guests? You just lost one.",1
"I agree with A.B Overly pretentious clientele nFood does not deserve the high prices nSnotty staff I think the only redeeming factor for this place is the patio. If you want French inspired Bistro food head over to Coup des Tartes. nIf you want REAL French food, go to Vincent's. nIf you want to be insulted, overpay for your food, and regret your evening, go to Zinc.",1
good Chinese food is apparently as easy to find as good pizza around here. I ordered from here hoping it was better than the subpar place I usually ordered. It was worse. I ill add the following disclaimer I ordered it for Chinese food. Maybe their thai dishes are better but I'm not going to find out.,1
This place and its patrons give me a rash. 2 stars for the fact that it is cheap and the music is good. If I had a dollar for every girl wearing red patent leather shoes I could have drank for days. But make sure that dollar is cash so I can pay for my drink. I think I am officially too old and this place confirmed it like a slap in the face.,1
i'm still full with all the delicious food from wcg! ordered the shrimp cocktail which had 6 jumbo shrimp with 2 different sauces. i had the half rack ribs and chicken which i liked them both. had the side of corn salad since the server said it was his fav. pushed our luck and continued on to dessert with the special pumpkin cheesecake. OMG! it was soooo goood. will go back.,2
Four star? Not so fast. nOur room was eh. There's only wifi on the bottom two floors. nThe pool was nice but had no shade and you have to stand in line at 9am to go put your towels out to even get a seat neat water. AND IT CLOSES AT 5PM. nWHA? Who closes a pool in the middle of the day in hot a Las Vegas? nThe bright shining light here was the restaurant Yusho YUM.,1
"Very pricey, but it's Vegas! The line for VIP was longer than the general admission line, so we ended up not getting a table. Music was great! While we were there they opened the club so it went around the pool at Encore. Made the club HUGE! Cover is free for ladies before 12 am if you had a ticket. We were staying at the Encore so of course the bartender gave us a ticket.",2
"Only sushi place we're found in Phoenix that gets repeat business from us. Most are awful, some are decent, but this place is good! Polite, quick service and tasty sushi! Their appetizers and entrees are also pretty good, though we usually come for the sushi. There are almost too many sushi options, we're slowly working through them. Do yourself a favor, get the ""Nixon Roll "". D",2
"I love Britney too but the sound was awful to me. The music was louder than the singing. The sets were beautiful and unique but I would not personally recommended this concert show. Strangely enough when I told people around here I was going to see the show no one said anything other than it was just ""Okay. """,1
"Nice shop with an impressive selection and inventory in the humidor as well as a fine array of gifts, lighters, pipes and other desk items for the discerning gentleman. Nice lounge area and all types of folks are welcome. Diverse crowd which makes it unpretentious. Also have punch cards for purchases so you can work to free product.",2
"My husband and I go here often since it's one of the only restaurants in town. However, even when we do have the option to venture further out, sometimes we still would rather go here instead! The food is great, the staff is very friendly, and the lunch prices are great. I personally feel like the dinner price is a bit too much for me. Still a great place to eat though!",2
"Bad service and even worse ""food. "" I'll never go back while in the area. I'd rather eat McDonald's or at some other fast food place they offer about the same number of ""healthy "" options. They get 1 star because of all the adorable old people there. Other than a hospital old folks' home I've never seen so many walkers and oxygen tanks in one place!",1
"I don't frequent Bath Body Works if I can help it. Around the holidays all the discounts and coupons call to me and I end up buying way too much and stock up not only my own medicine cabinet but my family's as well. This location had very helpful employees and organized shelves. I appreciated the help as I tend to wander around aimlessly, overwhelmed by all the colors and scents.",2
"Wow, feel sick to be charged 35 a day for a small refrigerator. Just to keep my 4 year old milk cold ? Thanks for nothing. There are ZERO signs in the parking garage pointing you to check in. hello. you can't just assume everyone knows where they are going. 6 dollars for in room morning coffee ? You guys are nutz. Really a big mistake coming here.",1
Walked in on a Friday night and waited for someone to decide to help us. Lots of staff just walked by till finally someone came and helped us. There were visably at least 5 or 6 available tables but still we were told a 30 45 minute wait? really? we went across the street and got a table right away. This place is pretty but that seems about it all it has to offer.,1
"Terrible service and oily food. We had to write down what we wanted from the menu and give the order to the hostess. Never received our order in time. Servers never came to check on us, we had to ask busboy for our check and drinks. By the way we gave tip to the busboy. Most of their dishes were salty n over cooked. Will not recommend this place.",1
"Yummy quick healthy fresh and fair price. Short walk from freemont street. Everything you want in a tasty clean and pleasant modern restaurant. Staffed very well with a good variety of meals and treats including smoothies. Take a tiny walk from your downtown hotel and show them good food fast can be affordable downtown. You do not have to make yourself sick on a ""cheap "" buffet.",2
"The service is horrible, I asked if I could change my order before she even entered it into the computer, and she told me no. When I got the sandwich it was dry and bland, the bun was hard and dry but the worst was the fries, a couple of them were still frozen and a couple were rapped in hair. Gross. Not a place I will go back too.",1
"I've eaten at allot of Steakhouses around the country and had a great experience at 9. It was awesome listening to Marley, The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and the Violent Femmes while eating an excellent aged bone in Ribeye. Beautiful ambiance GM Jeff Evans came by and introduced himself. I will definitely be back please don't change a thing.",2
"Comfortable seats in a good sized cinema. Concession stand prices are high, which shouldn't be a spoiler to anyone that's been to a movie in the last two decades. Stadium seating so that you're not stuck staring into the back of the head of the person in front of you instead of the movie screen. Seats move a little forward and back, plus the armrest which has a cup holder folds back.",2
"This place and hertz in general lost a loyal customer. Tis place is unprofessional and did not care about me as a customer. They got my reservation wrong and these ""sales people "" that get a commission out of selling you extra stuff on rental like insurance or gas fillip etc. Any who these snakes right here are salespeople now customer service and that's a shame",1
"Yay! no smoking allowed anymore, me and the kids can finally breathe! The Midway is full of fun games but prepare to lose lots of money and come back with a lot of stuffed animals for all your little cousins Don't forget to watch a couple of free performances, all of which are pretty good for free ppl juggling with feet and trapeze acts ",2
"Played this course today, course was in ok shape. There is no sand in bunkers, but I guess if you don't it into them you shouldn't have to worry. There was no ranger on course at time s there was 3 foursomes on same hole led to 6 hour round. If they are going to allow this slow pace make the cart girl work all day only saw her once on front side. I do not recommend this course.",1
Went on a Friday night. No room to sit and there's nothing lounge about that. The vodka selection was lacking and pricy for Vegas. Tons of hipsters but whatever. Finding parking in the area was refreshingly a breeze. Dimly lit but could have been even more so quite frankly. I'd be willing to go back at a less crowded time.,1
"Went for Sunday football. Service was soso. The football game was on, but they had a DJ playing. Wtf? All these great TV's and football completely drowned by the DJ. Listen Management. Have Great TV's, atmosphere and advertise yourself as a sports place. Tell the DJ to come a night when people are not watching Sunday football. KthxBye",1
There's just something about a firehouse Italian fully involved sub and Backdraft hot sauce accompanied by a Barq's vanilla root beer that really hits the spot on a cold winter day. The sub was hot and delicious. I don't know who crafted it but they did a great job. It was nice and messy. Firehouse is definitely the place to be on a cold day.,2
"I totally forget going here when I'm usually going to Wally World. Yesterday I decided not to go the extra miles to WW, and instead went here. The selection was good, the store wasn't jam packed with shoppers, and check out was not a bring a cot and nap while you wait. I'll return given the pain free shopping I had yesterday!",2
"this place has a laid back atmosphere more like a sportsbar but has very good food. Huge portions. The wings are awesome, huge and tons of flavor no matter which of the over a dozen you try. Boulder Gold and Coconut Thai are two of my faves, dressed and crispy. The sandwiches and burgers are killer too.",2
"Un chouette endroit dans pr u00e8s du m u00e9tro Rosemont. On y trouve une offre de repas simples, des sandwhichs, salades, p u00e2tes. De bons desserts, du th u00e9, du caf u00e9. L' u00e9tablissement fait aussi u00e9picerie bio, pratique pour faire quelques courses apr u00e8s son lunch ! Id u00e9al pour aller manger entre coll u00e8gues.",2
"Looking for Cajun? Look no further. My favorites are the etufee and gumbo. I stopped in on a Friday night and had the pork chop special, it had to be the biggest and most tender chop I've had! For those of you looking for a classic dirty rice they took me back to a LA coonass swap party. The live guitar sole was a great addition for back ground music.",2
"I like to drink as much as the next person but Essen Haus promotes binge drinking and throwing up. The food here is beyond reproach. With so many choices in Madison why go to some place and force feed yourself beer to the point of throwing up when you can get drinks, better music and better crowd in tons of other bars.",1
"Fun place with good burgers and beer selection. However, if you are curious about the Rossini burger that has truffles, foie gras, and a 60 price tag.don't do it. It's really good, but overpriced IMO. I'd opt for some of the ""regular "" burgers which are tasty and a better value. Also get desert elsewhere. I wasn't feeling the ""desert burgers "". Still a great place for burgers and beer though.",2
"Got an iced coffee here and it had a big bug in it. Left feedback and manager called me back saying there's no way it was from their store, basically called me a liar. Offered me a free iced coffee but told her I would never be drinking one again and that was that. So glad they r fine with losing a customer. Guess it's Starbucks across the street for now on, u get what u pay for",1
"Tried Shizen for the first time tonight and all I have to say is Wow! We sat at the Sushi Bar and Chef Paul not only took care of us, but amazed us with his unique Sushi creations! Being avid Sushi buffs would highly recommend Shizen if your looking for great Sashimi, custom rolls a chill atmosphere!",2
"We live right around the corner and eat here often. The garlic parm wings are great, burgers and sliders are always yummy, and they have pretzel buns! They have great drink specials and tons of stuff on tap portions are large and I always bring home extras. Some of the wait staff is sometimes not all with it but others are awesome!",2
"Yay for small family grocers! While Knoche's is too small and expensive for everyday groceries, this is where locals come time and again for good cuts of meat and various savory items for summertime grilling. Steve Knoche himself is often found helping out behind the meat counter. Don't forget to grab a big helping of their potato salad!",2
I took my first yoga course at Second Heart Yoga. It was wonderful! Nan was very sweet and helpful. The environment is very relaxing and I felt comfortable trying something new in the company of such warm people. I've also enjoyed the Sunday morning Yoga for charity. Nan led a class outside. Enjoying the nature and the relaxed flow of the course was a wonderful feeling.,2
The gal I talked to on the phone said I'd hear from a driver within an hour of my call I did not get a call and the driver didn't show for almost two hours. The driver was very friendly and a very cool guy and I appreciated his help. But a hundred dollars to tow a motorcycle 6 miles? I'll just push it next time.,1
"stopped in here last month after eating dinner at the house with some of my fianc u00e9's work buds. they wanted to go get some cocktails after, so we thought we'd give this craphole a go. THERE WAS NO A C ON. IN JULY. and the place was still packed! it stunk of bo and was just disgusting. i demanded we get out of there before we all passed out from heat stroke. avoid.",1
"The new roof too is beautiful, limited bar, and only one bartender which made for slower service, but it was a good starter for the night. Drinks were very pricey, I left with a 100 tab. Will go back just gotta drink less next time. Gorgeous views, laid back, and fun. Wish there was louder popular music. Could be good with a few tweaks ",2
"I go here about twice a month with my boyfriend and my baby. Waitress can first come off as rude but she is super helpful. She always tells me how cute my baby is too. sushi chef is super cool and sushi always comes out fast. nif you go, order the INAKA ROLL or CALIFORNIA CRUNCH. shit is to die for. love the yum yum sauce.",2
"I had a bad feeling when I went there today, the location is bad, very end of Avondale downtown, nasty place. I had Mojito chicken frybread and I was expecting something better than Taco Bell's Chalupa but I'm disappointed. Frybread was good but they didn't give me enough chiken and cheese and lettuce was old. I wasted my money. I feel like I'm gonna have a diarrhea today.",1
"I love Sam's Town. I feel like I'm far away from Las Vegas. If available, request the room with the view of the atrium for 10 more. I got a 4 Star room for 29, can't beat that! You can bowl, watch movies or just hang out in the atrium. Lots of restaurants, too. I thought the buffet was okay. For the price, this is my favorite place to stay in Las Vegas!",2
"I am not sure how this place has an overall four star rating and I think most will find that misleading. The only thing going for this place is the bread. It is pretty good. However, that is the only good and does not outweigh the bad and the ugly price, meat portions and other non descript things about it. I so wanted to find it similar to the Boudin Bakery but no dice.",1
"Stumbled across this place by accident, what a great surprise! Several veggie options and not just iceberg lettuce and sad veggies. I recommend the californian, the flavors were perfect and the bread was soft and crusty. The staff was kind and took time to explain all of the sandwich options, even letting us try samples! Absolutely recommend giving it a try!",2
I had Modern Salon and Spa Uptown do my wedding party's hair. Our hair and make up turned out ok but we felt that we were way over charged. I had one bridesmaids who was in the chair less than 20 minutes and recieved a curled pony tail. She was charged 85.00. Nobody at the salon could understand why we were upset. I would not reccomend having your wedding party go to Modern.,1
"Food is good, not great. Healthy place to eat but not traditional Greek food. No gyros, basically only chicken and turkey pitas, and the roll ups are made with tortillas. I was under the impression it was more traditional Greek food. I wouldn't recommend if you want real Greek food. Still a healthy, fast place to eat.",1
"Vast amounts of poorly prepared food presented in a raucous atmosphere of dragooned waiter waitress choruses of the ""special "" restaurant birthday song. If you don't have a screaming infant you need to bring to a restaurant, don't go. The Veal Parmesan was a howling mess. It's an ""Italian "" restaurant, and they don't even serve capellini.",1
"Slow slow slow. You'd think getting a smoothie would be the quick option, but it takes 15 minutes for some reason to run the blender. I timed it. And that's after you wait to order because only one of the four people behind the counter wants to take orders. They were not busy, but I watched them completely lose a guy's order for a burger. Not recommended.",1
"The waitress was on her cellphone 5 feet away from us for five mins, when we came into the restaurant she was eating right at the hostess stand, and to top it all off my boyfriend ate bad fish and he is now currently sick in bed on our vacation ruined the trip for us. Burger was average. Fries were pretty good. Please don't go here.",1
Came in for the 4.50 pizza combo and was told its for students only. Gotta have an id to get the deal. Went to pull up my school info on my phone but was asked what he wanted me to do he already charged me. Best thing is that as he delivered my non student discount meal . I shared it with my friends 7 year old kid who was at the table with us. Wont come back.,1
"We ordered a variety of morsels, everything was delicious and we had a lovely view of the people passing by, as we sat by the window. The only drawback was the Ice Age conditions. I was wearing napkins as a capelet, and there was no way to turn down the A C because it was controlled by the casino, not the restaurant.",2
"Underwhelmed! I don't like to go to the hospital so why would I want to wear hospital gowns? Why do I want to watch a bunch of fat people getting spanked by carnival folk? Vegas is the correct location for this garbage. If the food was actually good, this would be a far different review. Dumb gimmick!",1
Ryans is a such a great find! They have animal products for such a cheap price and the more you buy the more you can save! There is a minimum 25 dollar purchase but i always.ALWAYS spend more because there is so much stuff for such a good price. The place is setup like a warehouse.because it is.and isn't the prettiest place I have ever shopped but for the prices.you deal. I keep coming back!,2
This place is a joke. The office staff is rude. The offer all these amenities which will be unavailable for moat of my lease. Who takes a pool at of use right before summer in Vegas? A new management company took over and raised my rent 150 a month for nothing! It has taken 10 months to fix my dishwasher. Do not waste your hard earned money here.,1
"Before the internet, Four Star and the old Majestic used to be my only lifelines for gay, underground, alternative and international movies. Their library has grown deep over the years and still dwarfs the options on Hulu or Netflix. It has recently gone co op with the same helpful, down to earth staff as always.",2
I was excited that this is close to my house but after giving it 3 shots I can say it is just no good. I went in tonight and there was an employee there who had no idea what he was doing and took 15 minutes to make me a drink. Then I had to pay 4 for a tasteless chilla. I want my money back but I can't be bothered arguing over 4. The people with me got donuts and said they were stale.,1
"Came here for the lunch buffet. Most of the food was pretty average. There is good variety, but the only good section was the American food section. The meats were all cooked very well. Some of the desserts were pretty good too, like the baklava and creme brulee. There's also a huge selection of cupcakes, but I didn't try them.",1
"Great service by all employees. They're all so friendly and go out of their way to remember your name. It should be easy cause I'm a regular. Food is so so, but what do you expect from a bagel. I haven't had their sandwiches. I dig the iced coffees but make sure you specify ""iced "". It sometimes gets confused with 'frozen'.",2
I had some sort of grilled cheese with three sauces. I enjoyed it immensely. The location is great. They're gonna kill it because nothing is really around there that can compete. I hate the bathroom doors. HUMAN FACTORS people. Human factors. Will I be there very often? No. Is it a decent place that's going to attract a lot of yuppie duchebachery? Yes. But I'll play along.,2
"I'm not easily bored with food, so i find it really offensive when I was here and the meal was not exciting. From decoration to menu, it was all a snore. nI dont usually use how busy a dining floor is to judge how good a restaurant is, but when we were here, the place was completely empty, so i'm positive I wasnt the only person that was bored with this place.",1
"The Strom Spa is not the largest spa in the Montreal area, but I love the location, I really enjoy the various events they do on Thursday nights such as the Cozy Thursday, or the All night event where you are free to talk without any worries especially good for my ladies friends who always like to bend the rule! The bar and food are also very enjoyable!",2
"I recently relocated back to AZ from the Washington D.C. area. It was there that I got into Bikram yoga love the heat! Well, this hot yoga gives you the detoxifying heat that you love from Bikram with power moves like planks and push ups . What a fabulous work out. The instructors are excellent and each class is different and challenging. I'm so glad I found this studio.",2
"Steak burrito, enchilada style was excellent! nI got mine with the cilantro rice, black beans, steak, and hot sauce. nEven though I got their hottest hot sauce it didn't seem spicy at all. nThey put the enchilada sauce and cheese on top then send it through a little conveyor belt oven that toasts the top beautifully! nA little lettuce and pico on the side. yummy!",2
"Marvelous venue for Cabaret style shows and musical events. Somewhat small seating, but this allows for a nice connection to the performers. They have Salsa Dancing here on Friday nights, wine or beer tastings some Tuesday nights, the space is programmed by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Cabaret is directly behind the Backstage Bar, so dining and bar service is available.",2
"The food was flavorless and overcooked. The service was terrible, took forever to get anything and the staff was very rude. But the worst thing of all was how DISGUSTING the place was. EVERYTHING had a nasty film on it. The pictures on the walls were splattered with food. The sugar caddy was dripping with something sticky. And the chairs had food on them when we sat down. NEVER COMING BACK",1
"I went to Butterfly Wonderland opening weekend, and had a fabulous time. It was nice to be educated about these amazing creatures, and be able to see them flying everywhere in the observatory room. I thoroughly enjoyed the 3D movie, and entire experience. This is a great place to take children, and a fun date idea!",2
"You have to have some set of balls to have the word ""spice "" in your name and put out food as bland as this place does! It's like it all came out of the same buffet leftover tupperware. Worst chinese food I have ever had. Service was just average at best. When I can say Panda Express is way better than this place and that's not saying anything , I suggest you eat ANYWHERE else.",1
"I don't trust anyone but Bill to do my electrical work. I've used his services exclusively since my first encounter with his company. He did my entire 900 sq. ft. home addition and remodel. His work was precise and done right the first time. Unlike some other electricians I'd used in the past . nIf you have an electrical issue, Bill's your man!",2
NEVER EVER EAT HERE! YOU MIGHT DIE! nIt is so disgusting. The food tastes like grease and the omlette was scary. A FLY was in my apple juice. A FLY! It reaks of smoke and is just plaiasty. The only good think about it is the sign. If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars. And I like diners. My boyfriend and hunt them out in other cities.,1
"Consistent with other reviews, this greenway is 5 stars all the way. Very nice seating area, picnic area, wall cascading water fall, big clock. Has geese in the river, nearby shopping and dining district, very safe and open space. Once section has vines adorned pathway. Where else can you ask for all these perks in a greenway? Best of all, FREE!",2
"Ahhhh the Mac Shack, nothing but bad for ya goodness! I have tried many of the specialty dishes here but the one I always go back to is the Crazy Alfredo. My second choice is always the Smokehouse. My wife and daughter love the one with the hot dogs mixed in, can't remember what its called because I won't eat it! haha Check this place out when you're in the mood for pasta fast.",2
"Having grown up and lived in California and Oregon, I am used to WINCO and very happy to have one relatively close to my home. Good prices, great produce and meats, and love the bulk foods section. It's often less expensive than Walmart and unlie Costco, you don't have to buy 100 units of whatever you need.",2
"just. kill. me. now. Heinous parking even middle of the day! Ridiculous to get around and so crowded it gives me hives. I will travel to the PetSmart on Elliott rather than here just to avoid it. Will bring small child to matinee only and even then, only during the week. Completely not fun. On any level.",1
"What a tourist trap! My dad has fond memories of coming here when he'd visit his hometown of Pittsburgh, and every time we've been back in the last decade it's been quieter and crappier than the last. I think this is the last time for us. There are very few stores and they are not so great, as a whole. Unless you plan on checking out the incline, I'd skip this destination. It's just boring.",1
"The bread, croissants, and pastries are all out of this world at La Gourmandine. Absolutely must stop in shop for anyone in the Pittsburgh region. So many delicious choices and the staff are friendly. Whenever i go on a morning walk around Lawrenceville, I always seem to find myself stopping in for a pastry.",2
"I have to agree that the service is terrible. If you get the English speaking girl, ask for someone else. She is worthless. She has screwed up our order more than once. We were 50 a week customers for 2 years. There's a chinese restaurant on every corner here in Vegas. You would think you would try to rise above the rest.",1
"A new favorite for us foodies! We are always on the look out for new and different and Vovomeena delivered! Between the Mexican Benedict and the B.M.O.C my BF and I were beyond satisfied. The Japanese cold brewed coffee was spectacular.try the lemon jalape u00f1o and the green tea mint flavors, you won't be disappointed",2
This is the worst company to deal with. I have a rental property in Las Vegas and they manage it. If I could rate no stars i would. They constantly change there billing address so that they can charge you late fees and the fees are so inflated i don't know how the government doesn't close them down.,1
"Stopped in here early Sunday morning on my way to work. It made me remember why I avoid fast food. Went through the drive thru, paid for my food, got my food, and the guy said ""have a nice day. "" He never gave me my change. I didn't say anything because it was only 20 cents, but I'll never return and I don't encourage anyone else to eat here.",1
"If you like disgruntled rude teens touching money, the register, their face, everything else in the store and then bare handing your ice cream cones, then this is the place for you! Yummmm, bacteria! Oh and getting their knuckles in your ice cream while they scoop it out of the bucket is super tasty as well. Germaphobes beware.",1
"On March 23rd, I had a very poor dining experience at The House at Secret Garden and wrote a polite letter to management that evening. It is now over a month later, and I have STILL not received any response. Based on the poor food quality, incorrect menu listings, pricing and TERRIBLE customer service, I would not recommended The House to anyone looking for good food or good service.",1
I came here for lunch and had the okra dish with chicken. There was something really odd about it like they used dirty oil or a dirty pan for the stir fry. I was quite disappointed. The bathroom was also a bit dirty. I think for great Malaysian food in the US you have to go to the DC area or California.,1
"This is a great place to help the kids expand their reading horizons. The staff is really helpful and can get ahold of just about anything you need. It's a ton of fun to go in here and play around seeing what you can find. The selection is pretty good, but if they don't have it in stock they can order it for you.",2
"I ordered the Crepe Milan. It took a while to make, but I was io hurry. The consistency of the crepe was too soft, and was very difficult to eat as a result. It would fall apart before reaching my mouth. every. single. time. My coworkers laughed at my plight. It was like trying to have soup with fork. Shame. I love Crepes. I wouldn't come here again.",1
 12 for turkey burger sliders would be worth it if they were good. it was just ground turkey thrown on the grill. no seasoning. totally bland. my friend said her 17 salad was miserable. the shrimp was over cooked and all she could taste was grill burn marks. our waitress was MIA and . we won't be back.,1
Been coming here for a few years now and the prices are pretty good on products. Sometimes they have awesome deals when you can get them. When I was doing nails all the time I was here every other week. The staff are pretty helpful as well. Sometimes they lag behind in getting the brand new stuff you see in the magazines but eventually they get it.,2
"After several times visiting Mandalay, we finally decided to try this place. I was excited about the 4course dinner package but we decided to splurge and get the 5course chef menu where you let the chef prepare the menu along with the wine pairing. The service was wonderful. The only bad thing was that they weren't loose on the pouring of the wine,",2
"We've ordered a dozen times, and food is always good. My absolute favorite is the Moroccan Spiced Chicken Dry Plum Pizza. It is the best pizza I've ever had, delivery or no delivery. Wings and everything else is good too. I wasn't a fan of some of the Greek appetizers, but I think that was just my personal taste.",2
"They have a nice deck and are dog friendly. They often bring water for my dog when the server first approaches. AWESOME! Food is good and moderately priced. I always get the meatloaf for a meal. When hanging out, you can't go wrong with the nachos or wings. Cool place to relax with friends.even if it is a Bills bar.hence the 4 star only. ",2
"This place was horrible. The food took ages, the waiter screwed up our order, and after waitng for what felt like hours. it wasn't even edible ! I wouldn't suggest it at all. but if for some strange reason it's a must, stick with the beef carpaccio. Everything else I tried from the pasta to the chicken to the tuna tartare was a nono.",1
"Kung pao shrimp looked alot better in the picture, everything else is just typical asian fusion. Ordered several dishes shrimp, macademia nut crusted chicken, stirfry, salad. , the pictures on menu made it look alot better than how it look like in reality and taste wise.not good. Nothing about this restaurant was phenomenal ",1
"The worst nail spa! Got a full set tips were too large, whites way too big! nWent back a couple days later he was not happy. nThe pedicure girl used a cheese grater on me without asking. She cut my heels! nI have since gone somewhere else. where the guy repaired my nails and had a much better pedicure. nBeware of this place!",1
Great pizza and quality live music. Two of my family members are vegan and ordered the meatless sausage and meatball sandwiches. I had a bite of both and they were delicious. The owner recommended her original handmade vegan cheesecake. It was excellent. It wasn't on the menu yet so you may have to ask for it.,2
"Unbelievable! I just attempted to book a party of 16 for dinner and was informed I had to put down a 500 deposit AND they were going to charge me a 150 ""booking fee ""! I asked if that would be applied to the bill and was told nope it's the fee to book the reservation! nSo they just lost a good size party for this evening!",1
"I loved this place when i was last there.a few months ago. Great burgers. I have since gone vegetarian and was looking forward to trying their veggie burger last night but when I got there at 5 30pm, they were out of veggie burgers ? I was pretty bummed. The manager gave me a 10 discount on my next visit. So, I guess they handled it, sort of. Nice people, but I was still bummed.",2
"Not a memorable club, I can barely remember anything that stood out other than ugly ass girls getting up on the stripper poles! nLuckily my gorgeous friend got the balls to go up there and give Jet a little bit of eye candy. We barely stayed here for an hour. WAY too much fog and strobe light action. just wasn't digging it.",1
"Great little spot to find a gift for your mom or your best girlfriend. They have a nice selection of furniture, frames, vases, and other decorative items. They also have a small selection of greeting cards on recycled paper with soy ink . The only downside was the smell of scented candles which I found to be a little over whelming when you first walk into the store.",2
"This place is just a standard run of the mill diner. Not too bad, nothing too special. Local paper has it rated as the best diner in Las Vegas. Those people need to get out of town more and try some 21st century diners. It didn't help that we were in Vegas and at midnight their bar was closed.breakfast was good the next morning but they easily lost a star for the night before.",1
"Unique food, great service and loved the ambiance! My husband had the shrimp pasta and some of the pasta was even died black with squid ink. They make their own pasta and everything was fresh! I loved the variety of the menu and watching the other dishes brought out made you want to return to try them out.",2
"Before you invest too much in this review, I must make a point to say I do not like buffets. Seeing as I now live in Vegas I thought I would try ""the best one "". It's mass quantities of sub par food. The good news, although it's massive it seems like people get through it at a disturbing rate. If you are buffet fan, check it out.",1
"I had high hopes, but i was not impressed. this is the first show i started falling asleep with. It came with my hotel when we stayed there. It had high flying acrobatics with water. the performers come from the roof hooked to cable. I didn't really hate it i just wasn't impressed. Glad i didnt have to pay for it.",1
"J'ai u00e9t u00e9 vraiment d u00e9 u00e7ue par la pi u00e8tre qualit u00e9 de la nourriture, surtout pour le prix qu'on a pay u00e9 4 pour un petit plat de riz! chaque personne! . J'ai pris le Aloo Gobi et ce n' u00e9tait pas tr u00e8s bon, pas particuli u00e8rement savoureux. Mon amie par contre, elle a aim u00e9 son plat. En tout cas, je ne reviendrai jamais ici .",1
"love love love this bar! easily the most beautiful hotel bar ive ever been to. the concept is great, you are literally inside a giant 3 level chandelier. we walked by it several times throughout our weekend stay, but only went inside and had drinks once and it was a Friday night so it was slammed. we were able to get drinks but no seats were available at all so we didn't stay long.",2
We dont have one so I thought I would give it a try in Las Vegas. Foods not bad but not worth the price thats for sure. Plenty of good burgers in Vegas for 1 2 the price. In N Out and Five guys are within a mile either one is better. Both our fries had clearly been sitting for a while as they both just about room temp.,1
"I came here with my family and we were all very disappointed. The service wasn't spectacular and for my money I'd rather take my business to the Aria buffet. Most of the food was too salty for my taste the soda came from a pitcher and didn't really taste right, it wasn't crisp. The desserts weren't very impressive. Overall I'd say skip this one.",1
"I've shopped here for awhile.I love, LOVE this treasure of a store. Very friendly owner Nanci . I follow her store on Facebook and love reading up on all the updates and specials they have. I even told her what I was looking for for my daughters bedroom and within 12 hours she had pictures sent to my e mail. I highly recommend this place is you are looking for treasures! ",2
Ordered Vegetarian Pad Thai and Thai Ice tea. The pad thai was so bad despite me ordering like a spice level 8 . No flavor. not enough salt. It wasn't so good. In fact I still have half of it left in my plate as I write this review and I am going to have to toss it. Rather not eat Veggie Pad Thai ever here,1
"Located on the second floor of The Four Queens Hotel Casino, this was a pleasant dining experience overlooking the casino, with attentive waiters and waitresses has an ""outdoorsy "" appeal to mimick al fresco, with outside lamps indoors and brick archways. The ""Chicago style "" Al Capone deep pan pizza is recommended. Italian Cuisine.",2
"My main complaint here is that I was fooled. They advertised a rate and then when I checked in, there was a ""mandatory resort fee "". They know they have you by the shorties because valet has your car and you have traveled so far and yada yada yada. nMy rate was uncreased about 40 . nFooled me once. Shame on you. It won't happen again.",1
"Mario's is full of Brah Dudes. If you're 21 and a Brah Dude yourself or wanting to meet a bunch of Brah Dudes, you might enjoy it. It's not a place I'd choose to get food I've tried a few things there and they were super mediocre. The best thing about it is the rooftop deck, which has beeicely renovated since Mario's purchased the bar. Pretty nice on a summer afternoon.",1
"I've been here quite a few times, and let me give you the tl dr about the place. The traditional hotdog, with a bunch of different stuff on top of it. I'm a hotdog lover and I've tried every single regular dog on the menu and I like it most of the time. Except that it's just that odd time when something comes out a bit strange or not quite right that makes me dock one star.",2
"The place smells like dirty feet and socks upon arrival but that's because everyone's shoes are off. However, during the week for 8 younger kids can jump their little hearts out all day. Children 3 under and approximately 4. Great place to tire the little one's out and for the adults to chill and relax on the massage chairs.",2
"Our server was very unfriendly and unwelcoming. I felt like I should have apologized for being there. The food was very sweet . the soup, spring roll, garden delight . all too sweet. Nothing was spicy! Overpriced for the quality of food and service. I highly recommend you go to Thai Rama on Camelback if you want good Thai food and friendly service.",1
"We were walking around Fremont Street for the first time and ran across this place. The food was amazing and the view of Fremont Street has to be the best there is. Our group of four ordered about 6 different tapas dishes and the sangria. Absolutely all of it was great. Fun atmosphere, amazing views, great food, helpful friendly staff and good prices. What more could you want from a night out?",2
"Blah! What a disappointment! After reading reviews I was anxious to try this place, but it was a total let down. We all ordered recommendations from the waiter stuffed peppers, green chile meatloaf and tacos. No one was impressed. I'd go here for drinks. The restaurant was really cool inside and the margs were great. Pass on the food though for sure!",1
"LOVE KOREAN FOOD. Good place, great authentic people. Love the small side dishes. always ready to eat. Though recently they started serving smaller portions of their side dishes which is really disappointing. Servers though do have good recommendations and will provide helpful answers to any questions you may have about the menu.",2
I paid 40 per person for New Year I was extremely disappointed thinking that the food would match the 5 star rating the hotel has. The decor and resturant is very elegant and beautiful but the food is terrible and expensive. I left feeling ripped off as the food crap and I would of been better off going to Dennys for breakfast.,1
"Tried the restaurant week menu. I had a taste of the Ahi appetizer coming back for the full thing later , steak Gorgonzola pasta, and my hubby had the BBQ chicken and ribs. The mashed taters and corn were also tasty. Not a bad taste in the bunch and the meats were all done properly.no over or under cooking.",2
"I love this mall, my favorite in the valley! Great food in the food court, very bright and a ton of great stores! I also love that there is so much around this mall, the whole area is full of shopping which is really nice. It's a great place to find higher end stores without the obnoxiousness of Scottsdale Fashion Square. I've found most of the service is friendly and the help desk is great.",2
"Really solid great rice bowls, fresh ingredients and nice sized portions. I am a big fan of the chicken teriaki bowl and the macaroni salad can't miss when you make it with cavatappi and it's a very clean open kitchen. Staff are pleasant and it's a visually appealing venue to sit and eat in. And grapefruit Jarritos on ice nice as well!",2
"TVs are the only reason to be here. Couldn't order all drums for wings even after offering to pay a little more. Salad came out with everything else. ""Oh, you wanted it first? "" Yep, I did like everyone in America. BBQ chicken sandwich was flat dry piece of chicken drowned in BBQ sauce. Move along and find another place to send your time and money.",1
"So if you have read any of my other post you know that I have been having trouble finding a good nail salon, well Thank you YELP and people who review! I found Warner Nails and I have found my spot now! Whew, Thank you! Lee was my nail lady and she was so lovely! she did a great job on my Gel Manicure and my Pedicure! It was easy to get in and nice and relaxing. Thank You Lee! see you in 2 weeks!",2
"This is the real deal people. Hands down ! nCome here and be blowin away by everything. Haha no pun. Tanks in the parking lots, helicopter, bombs, humvees. Guns,guns,guns. Oh did I say guns. n whispers They have really cool GUNS! Booyahhhh oh don't forget to pick up your jaw. n "" You want big time. I'll give you big time. Here comes the pain! "" ok yelps what movie now? It's a gangster movie ",2
"This place makes good pizza! We ordered two complete pizzas for the eleven of us, and we just gobbled them up! The pepperoni pizza was really good, but my favorite was the white pizza with garlic. We found some relaxing chairs by the billiard table outside the hallway, and enjoyed the pizzas there. For good pizza at an affordable price, this is the place to go in Vegas!",2
Was there moments after it opened for the first time yesterday and was back today. New and beautiful. Spinning theater is the neatest feature of this gym. My favorite feature is the number of step mills. I should not have to compete for the use of those. There are several racquet ball courts and basketball courts. I will update after I have taken classes there.,2
"Love this property and Catherine was AMAZING the entire stay. WAS AMAZED at how good the food was at their restaurant downstairs, Palette ?. The wing and steak sliders were great. nThe only downside is its a little too close to the bad part of town. I was not worried nor have I ever had any issues BUT I would not want my wife to stay there on business alone.",2
"This store has some of the rudest employees of any store I've ever patronized. Even if you ask them a simple question like whether or not they have something in stock, and they act like you are being an immense burden. It's a shame because the store itself is quite nice. Management needs to do a complete overhaul and teach their employees some customer service skills.",1
This place is horrriiibbbblllleee. The egg drop soup seems to be poisoned by this yellow acid that kills the flavor of the egg drop soup. My mom ordered lo mein vegetarian and it was so salty. It was as if they poured Salt into the food. My dad ordered kung pao shrimp and just terrible. I cannot believe this restaurant exists and the service is not even great.,1
If I have a friend visit me from Seattle where I grew up THIS is where I take them. Anytime I meet someone new to AZ with the same taste as me in almost anything I bring them here. If it were not for this place and only a small handful of others I would be embarrassed when entertaining anyone from a real city that has any culture or class. Lost Leaf 5 HUGE STARS,2
"I've been going to Earl's since it first opened. This is my go to spot in Vegas. Their sandwiches are so cheap and their bread is amazing. I could eat here for days. If only there was an earl's in California. My faves are cannon ball. and tuna melt. their tomato bisque soup is good too! This place is soo good, that my friends spotted Lebron James and Chris Paul eating here!",2
"let me sart by saying WAY over priced buffet. its good food but not great for 31 pp for lunch. WOW. the tacos were good, crapes great, fruit not ripe, sald bar a joke. seafood statioever stocked up, with 4 cooks back there, the chiplote clams were good, but most of the calms were not open. I will not be ever going back there, there are better buffets for locals in Vegas.",1
"My bf and I got discount same day tickets to the show here and we had a great time. I like that all the staff is friendly , helpful and welcoming. the comedians and the host were all pretty funny. You can expect to interact with the comedians if you get VIP seats. The venue is small small so there isn't any escape from that. if you're high anxiety about that definitely sit in the back.",2
"Everything that the others have said is true. I do want to emphasize on the customer service. We had made reservations for 9 45 pm, but the place was still very crowded. Since we had to wait, the host gave my entire party a glass of this delicious white wine that I don't remember the name of. You must get the rabbit for your entree.",2
"Very classy Thai restaurant. You may want to make reservations, since it's a fairly small place and can get busy. Nice intimate atmosphere. The crispy Teriyaki chicken was the best teriyaki chicken I've ever had, seriously. My husband wasn't crazy about the duck dish he had last time.so that might be a risky thing to order here. Other than the duck, everything we tried was delicious.",2
Seriously the most pathetic burger I've had. ever? On the level of a Burger king or the like. With tip I paid 15 for the burger and fries. What a waste and they even managed to get the order wrong. A buffalo burger that had no buffalo sauce on it. When I told the waiter he made up for it by bringing a little cup of sauce. Oi. pathetic.,1
"Thought I would find a nice place to eat for lunch while passing through . needless to say, I wasn't thrilled. The prices were quite high, at least for what I was expecting. I ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich. It didn't take them long to deliver it, but it came out incredibly soggy. Gross. But the fries? They were the highlight of the meal. Absolutely delicious. I",1
"Been here a few times and every time the food is just great. Keep trying new things and never disappointed. Service is good and of course so are the drinks. Big time sports bar with TV's everywhere you look, so if you are looking for a quiet meal this isn't the place, but if your looking for a lively time or wanting to watch the game with good food and drinks this is the place.",2
"Great service and great food! My friend saw an ad for this place in a local newspaper and we decided to check it out tonight. My friend and I ordered the ""Flat bread and Dip Trio "" and ""Bruschetta Pizza. "" Both were excellent choices! The service was great, very friendly people! Not sure how the other people who wrote reviews left unsatisfied but we LOVED it!",2
"LOOOOOVE this place best breakfast around. Have been here many times, and have brought every single guest who's visited and they all rave and talk about going back. Everything's from scratch and flavorful, and there are some creative takes on the old classics. PLUS It's right at the hockey rink, so I can lace 'em up to work off the huge portions.",2
Ending up here after the Lion King Sept 2013 and was delicious. The mixed cold platter is fabulous and the donner kabob plate was perfect. We split everything with four people and got the baklava for dessert. Staff was super friendly and courteous. This is a BYOB restaurant and we will definitely go back. Very clean and inviting.,2
The gas is cheap. Plenty of gas pumps. And this AMPM has a Orange Whip drink which many others do not to my dismay. Plus when you drive thru sewer water and your truck has this ungodly smell to it of umm well you can figure it out. The carwash is a blessing at 4.99 with its spot free rinse and decent blowers to get it completely dry.,2
"My favorite place to eat in Charlotte! I swear they must sneak my grandmother down from heaven to work in the kitchen. Great Southern food and lovely service. They first time In was there they refused to serve my friend a salad, insisting on fresh southern veggies instead. They were just kidding I think.",2
The staff is always very courteous and extremely fast with their orders. This is probably the cleanest DD I've been in. The other DD that I go to over on south blvd is so dirty and the staff is really unpleasant often ignoring customers standing at the counter. I make it a point to come to the PMatthews location before heading to work.,2
"I had a bad experience here with an employee that no longer works there. When David the owner found out about it, he personally came to apologize and make it right. He was extremely genuine and just wanted to fix anything that was wrong. He really went above and beyond what I would expect out of any business owner. The food is also amazing. Try the fig and prosciutto pizza, it's delicious.",2
"I came in with a group of 6 friends for dinner today. Margaret was our server. The food was great. I wasn't very impressed with the plantains. I'm used to them being a little more cooked. I ate the curried coconut tofu, which as pretty good. The drinks are a must do. The mojitos were excellent along with the black cherry mango punch. I'm not a fan of either fruit but I did like the punch.",2
"From what one of their employees told me, they give away peoples rooms all the time. I'd know, this happened to my friends and I. And to make up for it, they'll act like it's NBD. nThe word incompetence comes to mind when describing the hotels manager and employee that gave up our room AFTER we checked in. How does that work you might ask? I have no clue. n Just saying.",1
Good healthy eats where everything is organic. But if eating organic food is not totally up your alley then it may seem a bit more expensive. I got the tuna sashimi salad which was really to die for. It was a nice size for me because Im not a heavy eater. Boyfriend got some steak tacos which were really good but you pay about 15 for only 2 small tacos.,1
just left the salon the Worst customer service ever! dont understand English had a pedi and a polish change left with scabs on my fingers and the pedi was the worst also i tipped each lady and neither said thank you! i tipped them both more than 20 WHICH THEY DID NOT DESERVE BEWARE STAY AWAY THERE ARE A MILLION BETTER NAIL SALONS TO GO TO!,1
"The service was terrible the host took 5 minutes to acknowledge us when we first came in, waiters kept bumping into our chairs and messing up our orders , the food was mediocre at best we ordered the NY strip with scallops, and appetizers of pan seared scallops and crab cakes , the tables were nauseatingly close to one another. There are definitely better places in Montreal than this, skip it.",1
"I am not quite sure what is wrong with all the people on this site giving this Restaurant high marks. I went based upon those and was extremely disappointed. This was by far and away one of the worst meals I have had in recent memory. The majority of my party felt ill afterwards. I would give it 0 stars, but Yelp doesn't allow that.",1
"I can't say enough good things about Dan! He got me in on short notice and got my 2013 Elantra looking sharp io time. You can tell that he takes great pride in his work. The rates are extremely reasonable! I would easily recommend him to anybody. I fact, I'm going to have him tint my fianc u00e9es car in a couple weeks!",2
"Walked in at 12 30 pm to grab ice cream. Over 20 workers were inside cutting the concrete floor down the middle. Stores open, we get our ice cream and move on. Shouldn't they have protected all the produce from concrete dust? The entire store was covered. Why is the store still open? Shut it down for a night.",1
Omg. Barbecue to die for. n. I have eaten in the best barbecue joints in the country and the road kill rule is right up there with the best of the best. I had the pulled pork and it was really good.the staff is friendly and when I first came thru the door one of the employees gave me a sample of the homemade sausage. It was delicious. I will return!,2
"How nice is it to have a Lee's right by your house? Decent selection of wine but unfortunately did not agree with the local reviews. We tried a few bottles based on store reviews and were pretty disappointed. Having said that, the Easter location is clean and convenient with a nice variety. So, if we know what we're looking for or following more well known reviews we're quite happy.",2
I love Wingstop! Garlic Parm and Lemon Pepper are soo good. I like these better than Buffalo Wild Wings as well. The way they are prepared are always consistent. Good crunch and flavor and made fresh. These wings are made when you order soggy wings are no good. Other locations around the valley. Their seasoned fries are pretty good too somewhat sweet.,2
Service is my number one priority. nWe had to wait 5 minutes just to get seated during a very slow lunch hour 12 30. Server missed a few things and had to be reminded. Food was not very good but I really liked the hot salsa that came with the chips prior to our food arriving. It was very good spice level for me. nBland place at best.,1
"great atmosphere here shalimar. a few months back i was there to help 2galsevents with a charity golf tourney. it was the ""par it in pink "" event. and it went really smoothly. i drove around and helped take some pictures of the event to post. i also helped with the set up pre dawn that morning. all in all this was a casual golf course right in Tempe and we had a great time that day.",2
"Kind friendly staff! You can tell they love their job! They're very gentle when it comes to the handling of their patients and explan everything in a very simplistic manner for those of us that aren't quite familier with the inner workings of our pets. Needless to say, I will be back again, my only hope is that I won't have to crossing my fingers that Chloe is over feeling icky forever !",2
We stopped in here for an after dinner beer and I really liked it. It's not a fancy place but is your classic neighborhood bar. There was a lot of seating around the large bar and plenty of tables surrounding the room. The bartenders were great and the beer was delicious. Crystal Corner is a great place to hang out at.,2
"I went there and had a daily special salmon sashimi, it only has 5 thin pieces and is 10.95 . I also had a soba, where the noodles looked exactly like what I bought from grocery for 3 a bag, and it's 7.95 . You can't say a sushi restaurant is good, just because champaign doesn't have other good sushi restaurants. I think I will never go there again.",1
I stop to shop here every other time I'm in Las Vegas so I guess a review is long over due. Name brands. Discounted prices. Sizes are usually picked thru. Styles may be a little dated however there are deals to be found if you're lucky. My friend's favorite is the Coach Store. They're usually giving a coupon at the door. Makino's Buffet isn't too bad. Parking can be a pain.,2
"I'm not sure what all these people are talking about, maybe I'm a fluke, maybe she's better at coloring. I've had short cuts before, and they never looked this crappy. I even went back to her to fix and got my 2nd worst hair cut ever. Its a shame because she seems so nice and I really wanted to like it. But seriously, worst",1
"Slimy and generic. I'm pretty sure that the sauces come from cans, with chunks of meat dropped in after ""cooking "". It's hard to describe how bad it was We've had much better food court Indian food . Are the good reviews posted by their friends? Totally mystifying. If anyone knows of real Indian food in KW eg actually cooked on sight , please share! Seriously, avoid.",1
"My sister and I were in Glendale to visit Cerreta Chocolate Company. We wanted a quick and healthy lunch and googled for sushi place in the area. We had a small teriyaki bowl, a small spicy teriyaki very spicy , a vegetarian sushi roll, and a miso soup enough to feed 4 people. Prices are good. Service was excellent! We had a great time visiting Arizona.",2
"poor excuse for a Westcor pad occupant. See ""Waiting "" the movie . Yeah, it's that place. grilled cheese sandwich looked like a brillo pad after three weeks' use see my picture n servers confused, unaware of their own menu n and that was just the content they were filthy n service timings all off n soda syrups not properly proportioned methinks it's the location. just stay away.",1
"Short version long wait, mediocre food, good service, overly sweet margaritas, and a band that were so loud conversation was impossible. If you're here for a bachelor party where you're happy to get drunk and scream yourself hoarse, then it's probably fine. but not my idea of a good dining experience.",1
"New favorite Greek place. Ordered Saganaki, hummus, pita bread, 2 baby gyros, a gyro platter, pomegranate chicken, cannoli, and yia yia's cookies. The owner came to our table every 15 minutes making sure everything was okay. Place is super clean and everything is super positive. At the end of our order we got a 15 coupon for our next visit. Can't wait to come back. Super reasonable too!",2
"I LOVE the interior of this place, its stunning! the lightning is perfect, huge bar, awesome furniture and so on. BUT the food is NOT up to pair unfortunately. if it wasn't for the poor food this place is 5 stars easily. to bad! Even the simplest things like a decent cooked burger. sad and such a waste!",1
"When we went it was like they were very desperate to get us in there. It was dead.and apparently hip hop night not rock night . It also wasnt until we left that we discovered there was a WHOLE other section with food and more people, but we were ready to bounce. Drinks were not that cheap and the service was not great in that back little bar. I doubt I will be back. Sorry folks.",1
Excellent food and very nice extended menu for veggies. I tried majority of pasties here and liked lot of them. Chicken tikka pasty is my favorite. Pesto and rosemary chickens are also my favorite. Cream of Tomato with croutons is by far one of the best soup I had. Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding formerly known as Temple pudding is heavenly and must try.,2
"New Orleans Sno Ball is extremely convenient, inexpensive, and tasty. The owner says he uses pure ice blocks, which is why his product is better than his competitors'. For 2.50 you get a medium 12 ounce? cup of sno, which never loses flavor. I got the tiger's blood flavor berries with a hint of coconut and I highly recommend it.",2
"The ride up to the top of VooDoo is long. Once you get to the top of the Rio, the view of Vegas is superb. We got there around 11 and we got in for free because we stayed at the Rio. The DJ stunk he played garbage. Luckily, a new DJ hit the deck at 12 and spun some sick beats. 1 for the go go dancers and 1 for the view. Vegas has nicer clubs lounges.",1
"I do not believe that this is a good dry cleaners. If you want to find out, then go and hopefully you have a better experience. The left a stain on my collared shirt and all of my white collared shirts then cleaned but didn't iron. They were all super wrinkled when I got them back. Some sort of weird joke?",1
"Absolutely LOVE this salon! Love the vibe, the amazing massages, the personable customer service, the extensive color bar, the mimosas, but most of all my stylist Lacey who gave my hair its life back. Could not be happier, I was seeking help for my blah hair and stumbled upon this jewel on Yelp who would have thunk?!",2
I would give it all 5 stars but i don't want it to go to their heads. They just opened and I have only been here this one time. Anyway I am so happy a more than decent sushi bar is in the neighborhood. I am sure i will be adding the 5th star soon. By the way the service was awesome Mike and John are tops.,2
"Just moved into neighborhood and found this restaurant on yelp. We were greeted immediately by friendly staff and we belief owners were working. The food was hot, flavorful and price was very reasonable. There was a steady stream of customers and they acknowledge their regulars. They have take out and do delivery which is a bonus.",2
"Horrible! This place is so dirty that I regretted getting my nails done here. The more I looked around the more I wanted to run. No customer service and the male helper was more interested in watching tv, sitting on his rear and smoking cigarettes while customers sat in filth. Never going close to this place again.",1
"The customer service was excellent and the food is really authentic. Since I'm Filipino, I grew up around yummy Filipino food, So I'm really picky when it comes to places that say they are ""authentic "". I can honestly say that Pancit Adobo's food is delicious and it tastes just like my Lola used to make! nMy recommendation nPancit Bihon, Chicken adobo and bbq chicken skewers",2
"all the naysayers seem have a bone to pick, the service here is incredible and the food is better. vegan options as well and staff that helps make sure your order has no egg or fish sauce. if your looking for thai, this is the best place in the valley we have been to, and being vegan, we have been to too many to count",2
We went to Liliana's for lunch and were impressed with the nice staff and good food. It was a little crowded but my food catfish po' boy arrived pretty fast and was delicious. Really good french press coffee with free refills was a plus. Seems like the patio would be great if it had been a bit warmer. I'll definitely go back.,2
"Great food! We couldn't make up our mind so we ordered way more food then we could eat, but every bit of it was good. Jon the owner is very informative an tries to make the atmosphere that of a large family gathering.IMO.some people my not care for that, but we loved it an ended up sharing our wine with the table next to us. We can't wait to go back! Thanks for a great dinner!",2
"City of Lights? ? nDoes not provide wall sockets nFor all the visiting guest to charge devices. I would expect this from a 3rd world country, what are they thinking? Trying to save some power, by not providing a good service to paying guest. Am I in the USA? nHow is it possible that a Dinky airport like Sacramento Blows Las Vegas out of the water?",1
"Came on a Friday night so this place was buzzing. Great upscale ambience, spacious dining room, friendly service. Lots to choose from on the menu and prices are not crazy. Meatballs, burrata jar with truffle honey, beet salad with goat cheese.All really amazing. Good cocktail menu, nice wine list and a great bar scene. The place had lots of tvs so I would definitely come back for a game.",2
i love this place. Good place to have a beer and a good burger. Not just typical burgers. this was my kids first bar experience. The quality and knowledge of the food was great. They have many burger choices. Being a picky eater this was perfect for me. My family loves this place out of all the fancy burger places in vegas,2
This place is close to the house with convenient hours and is clean. I think we don't have the smallest unit but it's spacious. It costs about 75. The one complaint is they make you but insurance which is not disclosed in anything we read about before going there. It's 9 a month for 2k worth of insurance which sucks.,2
"The wife and I have been making an annual pilgrimage to Vegas for about 9 years now. We have not ""repeated "" any shows up to this point. We first saw Zumanity about 5 years ago and decided to go back this year. THIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER! Women should wear absorbent panties and men should wear loose fitting pants. Enough said. GO SEE THIS SHOW!",2
"Atmosphere very small and lacked air conditioning. Whole in the wall kind of place. Fish tacos Super! Nice and hot. When you take your first bite, CRISP and flavorful. n You may need to consume at least four to be full. They are mini tacos. No salsa bar. They give you tiny containers with sauce. Expect long lines, since they were featured on yahoo.",2
"Decent. This was my first time here.Went in for an acrylic fill and repair. Nail station was dirty, technician was snippy. The whole station and others were poorly kept. The fake nails from the client before me were still on the table when I arrived and stayed there my entire appointment. My nail technician hurt my nails many times when she was working on me, and paid no attention.",1
"Artkore wrapped our windows, made our A frame sign, and did our pylon sign. We were so thrilled with the service and the results! Having our windows wrapped has quadrupled the walk ins for our business. It is clearly the best advertising that we could ask for! Rassiel was reasonable on his pricing, and fast and accurate in his delivery. We can't say enough good things about Artkore!",2
"I often have to have short meetings with clients. and they ALWAYS suggest Starbucks where 20 other little groups are always meeting. Now when I can I will be trying to direct them to Camille by Manon. The wifi is 100x better, the staff is friendlier, all of the food i've tried, from sausage croissants to desserts has been amazing. I hope to never have to deal with a Starbucks meeting again.",2
