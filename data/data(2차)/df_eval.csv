"I always stop in for a delicious sandwich before a movie. But, like an abusive relationship, I keep coming back for the hot sandwiches no matter how many times I get burned by the customer service.",1
"Being in the Southpark area, this is a great place to grab lunch! Every day they have really good lunch specials and also have a lunch menu which gets you smaller portions of their dinner menu at a discounted price. Still plenty of food as well! n nOne of my favorite items on the menu is the Wood Grilled Salmon Salad! The fish is always cooked to perfection and the vegetables in the salad are so fresh! n nI've also had their panini and the Lobster Bisque! Can you say decadent? It is so creamy and rich, you could have a bowl of bisque with a small side salad and it would fill you up! Plus, you get a yummy basket of bread and crispy flat bread when you are seated and its yummy!",2
"The food is very good. The staff are professional and food is prepared quickly and fresh. I personally enjoy the fish tacos and rib eye tacos, the hand made tortillas really take it to another level. I also like the tostadas with pastor or chorizo, they come with great toppings. And the rice is amazing! Great place for lunch or dinner.",2
"The food was better than the service, the portions are pretty large. i got a sanwhich that ended up having apples in i need to read the whole ingredient info next time not just chicken and bacon and get excited . totally ruined it chicken bacon bleu cheese honey mustard and. apples?! kinda weird i took them off at it was good. I think everyone working there used to be a door greeter at wal mart they were so slow. even the guy at the cash register seemed like he was looking for a picture on the screen instead of the words. overall i can just go across the way to panera bread if all else fails. oh but the spicy pickle itself. yeah it was delicious",1
"I had lost a front tooth in an accident, another dentist hit it with a drill bit and it shattered, I Should have sued her. Instead I allowed her to repaired the damage and it looked horrible! I later met Dr. Smallwood who fixed the false tooth and added a few veneers for a perfect blend. It not only looked natural but 12 years later there are still many dentist that give me compliments on my beautiful teeth and ""great dental work "".",2
"Looks and smells like DOS still but ALOT HAS CHANGED nKinda dirty, like they might have a cleaning crew, once a week at most. nTheir bartenders seem to know their drinks, but also know how to pour short. if you normally drink 4 cocktails, plan on it being 8 to get the same outcome.or just drink beer nOh on thursdays its .50cents to drink. but sometimes its worth the extra 4 bucks for a cocktail to not be around the guys who cracked open their piggy banks to come out",1
"Delicious! Both the steak and the concept. n nIt was a lot fancier inside than I expected. My boyfriend and I were dressed fairly casually, but it didn't seem to matter. We wandered in on Saturday night about 7 30pm worried that we might need a reservation. The host asked if we wanted to sit right away, but we wanted to get beer first! n nHe directed us to the closest place to buy beer and told us that he'd hold a table for us how nice is that! n nWe stopped into the little store, got ourselves some amazing Belgium styled brew and headed back. We were seated promptly and were helped by the most delightful waiter. Actually all of their staff here is amazing. At any given point, someone would ask if were okay it was a real team effort. n nOur waiter was funny and asked if we wanted English menus. He didn't want to assume we couldn't speak French, which was nice for us stupid Americans. We gladly took the English menus but joked about how we could just guess what we wanted Steak. n nHe explained what the different options were. My bf and I got the 7oz steak, which comes with a salad, vegetable green beans and unlimited fries. I asked if there was cheese on the salad that happens to me all the time since I'm allergic. He said no but returned a few minutes later and mentioned that the salad dressing might so offered oil and vinegar instead. I thought this was such a great suggestion and couldn't have been more pleased with his attention to detail. n nMy bf ordered the french onion soup, which was delicious! The salads were crisp and tasty. n nThey spaced out the meal perfectly. Enough time to digest in between. They put out delicious hot rolls on the table with butter. I usually don't eat the bread on the table for fear of spoiling my appetite, but they were too good to pass up. n nThe main course finally arrived and it was to die for. The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked just the way I wanted. The green beans still had a nice crunch to them and complimented the steak well. The fries were amazing cooked to golden perfection. n nIt really was an incredible meal. After we were done, our waiter took our plates and told us to relax, enjoy the rest of our beers and call him over if we wanted dessert or coffee. Exactly what a waiter should stay to two stuffed pigs! n nOverall the experience was delightful. We were treated like kings and queens, ate like them and in the end our bill with a generous tip was only 60. You just can't buy this type of meal in NYC for that price. n nenjoy!",2
"This will be a multi part review. First, I attended the orientation and this is what I saw. The classrooms are located in large rooms which are blocked off with partitions similar to what is used for cubicles in a work place . The grades are grouped 2nd 3rd and 4th 5th I'm unsure about any other because those are the grades I needed . All the kids have their own IPAD, which are not allowed to be removed from the classroom. Second, I attempted to enroll my child who is special needs. I was informed that there is not a separate resource room and that resource is essentially combined in a small group and taught by a regular teacher. I was also informed that even if my child is behind in learning I am not legally allowed to hold my own child back of course this was not a licensed attorney a grade. I have to allow the child to be continued to be pushed through to the next grade and next grade. LOL. And this would be what is wrong with the children in the state of Nevada. I am actually thankful that they did not accept my child because I would not want my child to attend a school that thinks they are too good to have my special needs child.",1
"Just as the rating prompt says, 'Meh. I've experienced better.' n nThere isn't a lot of choice for a sit down meal outside of the terminals at the airport, so I'm guessing that's the only reason why this place gets so much business. The prices were higher than I'd expect too, even if the food were better. n nIf you're flying out, I'd recommend trying one of the restaurants near the gates in the terminals. If you're coming in, wait until you get to the city or your hotel and eat something around there. If you're that hungry, this place is no more than a band aid on a bullet wound. A small band aid.",1
"Santropol is definitely a deserved institution. Apparently, they started as an attempt to save the block from urban renewal demolition. That puts this place in the hall of fame for this urban planner. They have the chillest atmosphere of near any place in Montreal their insane backyard is sublime, and it's cozy on the inside as well. For a vegetarian, Santropol is one of the best bets you can make. The menu is almost completely devoted to the art of the sandwich. This is an understandable focus given the location in French North America but I'm not a super fan of sandwiches. Despite this, they offer enough variety to keep me coming back on a regular basis.",2
"Not impressed, not a lot of options, food was bland and over priced n nFood 1 star nService 4 stars",1
"My friends and I came to Vegas for my bachelorette party, and to save a little money, we made a stop at Smart Final on our way to the hotel. It was a fast shopping trip, and we found everything we needed in the giant store. I'm going to skip the part where I would usually describe the store because you've been to a Smart Final, yea? n nWe loaded up on mixers to go with our vodka, bought a handle of Jack Daniels and a big jug of Arizona green tea. If you haven't tried Jack and sweet green tea before, I would recommend it for a simple mixed drink you can do at home. The combination contributed heavily to my untimely demise on our last night in Vegas. We also bought snacks, cups, and a lot of water. We were fully supplied for the weekend, and we made good use of it all. n nThe cashier was friendly, and asked us if we were sure we wanted the smaller handle of Jack. I'm glad we said yes although we finished every drop, the results did not suggest we needed any more.",2
I'm sorry. The only thing I liked was the coffee.,1
Great food and the service is amazing! Go here for lunch and you will never have to worry about getting back to work late. Fast prompt and friendly!,2
"Oh Ichiza, how we missed your extensive and affordable menu and how we missed your honey toast. Such a simple item that we thought would be easily found in California or even replicated at home, but we were wrong. n nRaku may have the new title as the best Japanese restaurant in Vegas but you are still one of the top izakayas around and your extensive hours make you a winner. n nOh and you even accept Amex. So cool.",2
"Don't even want to give this place any stars. I found a chunk of tin foil in my burger. I took it up to get a new one and the person didn't say one word to me. No sorry no nothing. Just took the burger, made me a new one and gave it back.without saying one word to me. Customer service is absolutely terrible which is a shame because the food is usually good there.",1
"This review is long overdue, but catching up on some reviews, so here I go. Keep in mind, this review is my experience from 4 years ago. With the group size we had, we didn't have full access to the full menu, but a well thought out tasting menu. Two things that stood out was the Kobe steak and the different assortment of desserts. I've never had Kobe up to that point, but it truly is an experience. The way it was prepared, and I'm sure you've always heard how it melts in your mouth, well.it really does melt in your mouth. Now the dessert, what I remember from this experience is, the pepper flavored ice cream. You say pepper? Yes, pepper. I can exactly say its for everyone, but if you have an open mind and enjoy trying out new things, it's worth a bite.",2
"We were very excited to try a Gordon Ramsey restaurant on this trip. Unfortunately, this experience left a lot to be desired. If we were going to a Red Robin it would have been fine but at a place where you are paying top dollar for a burger and the chief owner touts himself to be the master of the dining experience, adequate is not acceptable. The food was fine, nothing special about the burger, I had the apple, kale Caesar salad, it had 4 paper thin slices of apple and 5 shreds of kale leaves with sub par dressing. The fries were over done and tastes old. The only shining spot was the shake which was amazing. As far as service,we waited for 30 minutes after finishing our appetizer and no one came by our table. I finally had to flag down our waitress who informed me that that it does take a long time and she should have told me that. Which seems absurd that a burger place would take that long. When our appetizer, chicken sliders, came out moments after placing the order. In a place like Vegas where there are so many amazing options, don't waste a meal here.",1
"So had a couple not so great experiences with previous stylists. That led to serious frustration and not feeling good about my hair. Than I was referred to Ben Barnes. Seriously best stylist I've ever had.hands down. Oh and they give you wine while u get your hair did the entire time. Plus did I mention the head massages? Carson, Ben's assistant will literally put you on a different planet as he massages your head. All that being said Ben also fixed my half ass brazilain blowout, crappy reddish highlights, and is just TheGuy that should be cutting your hair the end. Oh and his brother Mike rocks too!",2
"How can you go wrong with Cheese on a Stick? My absolute fave that I must have whenever I see a Hot Dog on a Stick. This was in the Fashion Show Mall food court and the only downside was the line of other HDOS fans. Other than that, service was great and the food was cheesy and delish! n nThanks, cheese, for being so awesome and delicious!",2
"I don't corn dog much but when I do, I like this joint. I was craving it so baby girl I enjoyed some corn dogs, fries a cheese corn dog thing. Service was good friendly quick. what more can you expect",2
"If you've never had pig's feet for brunch before, this would be a good place to start. Our meal here was memorable. n nTo prevent me from getting a heart attack before dinner, my wife ordered a tomato, cucumber salad which was the first to arrive. Red green tomatoes and thinly sliced cucumbers were sprinkled with a light vinaigrette. I'm not a salad person but this tasted bright, crisp and fresh. n nNext, the highlight of the meal, eggs w pied de cuchon and spinach. What I loved about the way they served pig feet is that they took out all the bones and cooked the meat, fat and tendons to perfection. As it is, pork and eggs are a great combination but the softness and flavor of this pig's feet combined with fluffy eggs blew me away. I seriously contemplated getting another one. n nLast, and I think this is where this brunch became a meal Caligula would have in one of his orgies, came the pork chops. They were pan fried in butter and had fried sage leaves on top that added an extra layer of flavor to the meat. Absolutely delicious. Perhaps just a tad overcooked but took nothing away from the dish. n nI read some of the reviews regarding wait times but luckily we didn't have to wait. As with our general experience with most places in Montreal, the service was good and the place had it's own charm. Highly recommended for a sinful brunch.",2
"I came here once and ordered pho, and I was very disappointed. Bland broth, tough meat, I didn't get the Tram's hype. Not that I've ever tried mind blowing pho I've only eaten it in Pennsylvania, which is probably the problem but this was even worse than most. n nHowever, I've since been back and ordered the bun. Now I was impressed! Specifically with the version doused in coconut milk I love coconut anything, and on top of vermicelli noodles with a squirt of hoisin and sriracha, it was heaven. Only thing is, I don't like the selection of vegetables they use. Onions and broccoli just aren't my jam, and my favorite veggie to have with my bun, cucumber, was sadly MIA from Tram's version. n nI do consider myself to be a little bit of a fresh spring roll connoisseur ooookay, maybe not, but I eat them a lot , and Tram's are good, but not my favorite in the city. I know, a lot of people are all about Tram's rolls, but I like mine with lots of Thai basil, and you can barely taste it in theirs. They're still super fresh with a good amount of meat, so this is just a matter of preferences, not quality. n nRegardless of the meh pho, I can't stress enough that it's totally worth it to come here for the coconut milk bun! Delicious!",2
I went in here looking for a gift. I didn't see anything that caught my eye. Just not my style. nBut I'm sure this is a nice spot for the younger crowd. nI was really surprised they didn't have more accessories.,1
"i used them and it was the biggest mistake in my life, they made my car worse my car now has swirls like crazy. the detailer while buffing the car burned the paint on the hood and when they were using the buffer to wax the car they guy waxed my black rubber trim and now i have white streaks on the black rubber trim, i will never recommend or use this company again to detail my car.",1
"Ive been excited to try this place out since it opened if you weeks ago. nGreat location just up from LVAC gym on the end cap of a strip center, walking in there are small tables and bench seating as well as an outside covered patio. nThe menu has many great choices of Protein, hence, the name of the restaurant. I ordered the Lean Turkey Bowl but was certainly interested in the Bison and Elk meats, next time. nEverything was cooked very well and although the service took almost 20 mins with only 1 guy ahead of me who got his order with 5 10 mins made me wonder why it took so long, simply the cooks were standing around when me and the other guy walked in so not like there was a lunch rush. Anyway, the food was good and I will certainly go back to hopefully improved faster service and a move up to 5 stars, until then 4.",2
"The food here is fair and the service was very poor. The waiter took our appetizer order and we didn't see him again for another 30 minutes. What should of been quick lunch turned into a 1 1 2 hour meal. The guacamole is not very good, it doesn't seem made to order and that's a shame. I'm sure that the food and service is much better than what we experienced.",1
"First time here was last week . Good sandwiches and a fast moving line. Only complaint is that a HALF sandwich, cookie, and drink came up to about 10. Will still return though to try again.",2
Wow Webster Orthodontic is terrific. Friendly and quick. The staff got us seen and braces on the same day.,2
"This is one of my absolute favorite Phoenix restaurants. Great service, even better food. You must try it!",2
"The food tastes like barf coming up, not going down . Yesterday I ordered a dosa that came with a small cup of vegetable soup on the side. The soup tasted a bit off, and I only had a few bites, but it was enough. Today I have done nothing but puke. n nIn fairness, we ordered three different dishes last night, and nobody else in my family is throwing up today, so if you think that two out of three ain't bad, Tamarind might be just the place for you.",1
"Hidden due to construction, look hard to find location. Service could have been better, waitress needs to be more upbeat and cheerful.",1
"I got food poisoning from the steak here. n nSo did my friend who ordered a steak sandwich , and while we were dining, I overheard a phone call that was very likely a possible foodborne illness complaint. The waitress responded with comments like ""I'm so sorry. no we have not had any other similar complaints. I am so sorry I will have the GM call you back. "" I did not think anything of it at the time because I understand it could be anything. n nI called, with no mean intentions, to inform them that I, as well as the doctor I went to see at Carle Clinic, were 95 positive that Wedge was the source of this foodborne illness, and the doctor assured me it was NOT the flu. Wedge did not return my 3 calls until 3 days later, and the GM's response was that ""I'm pretty confident we are not the source. There is a bad flu going around. "" Thanks for the call. By the way, unless your steak always tastes that dry, then there probably was something wrong with it. Will not return again. n nGROSS!",1
"I have to say I was super excited about a Golfsmith opening a store in Summerlin. I frequented Golfsmith in Woodland Hills CA quite often and am a recovering golf hoe. I was truly afraid of how much damage this place would inflict on my bank account. n nUnfortunately, I don't think Golfsmith will have to be concerned about my problem. I've been to the store 5 6 times and the experience has been relatively consistent but in a negative way. The sales people seem like nice guys but will only bust their ass if the perspective customer look the part. Maybe its my problem for not looking the part lol but they should try to be helpful to everyone. I understand if its a crazy busy day and they have to customer profile, but it was dead and they prefer to putt around than help potential customers. n nAt the end of the day, I am more saddened that I have to write this review because I was really looking forward to pitching in and do my part to ensure downtown summerlin and its tenants get off to a solid start. But I can't in good conscience spend money at a place where laziness is kinda apparent.",1
I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about. I called this afternoon and was able to get a same day appointment. I didn't have to wait even a minute after checking and I got a great gel mani and pedi! I'll be going back for sure.,2
"I'm giving them 5 stars based on their entertainment factor. I just took my two year old son, and he was entertained for 2.5 hours. Everyone was very helpful. We enjoyed looking at the animals, the aquarium, and playing with all of the shooting games. Lunch at the cafe was very good as well. I live in Phoenix, and it was well worth the 30 minute drive.",2
"I came to Vegas for the NASCAR weekend and stayed at the Tuscany for the first time. We came with friends who liked the format of the hotel rooms away from casino, and the ease of getting your vehicle. I would agree that these are great perks but the best thing about the hotel is their housekeeping staff. After arriving home, I realized that I left 2 bottles of expensive perfume and a pair of pj's in the night stand. When I called the hotel, they transferred me to lost and found and to my surprise, they had my belongings. It was just 3 days and the package arrived to my home, wrapped with utmost care bubble wrap around the perfumes . Honesty goes a long way in this day and age. Kudos to housekeeping and being honest and providing a clean room.",2
"I love a good breakfast, but Skillets is way too over priced and the food is not good. The eggs were swimming in grease, the fruit cup is a served in a 2oz. container like the kind most places serve you a side of salad dressing in , the sausage was deep fried, twice I had to guess, and the service is so bad they just bring you a pot of coffee and change you 2 for it when all I wanted was a cup. I work in the area and asked a few of people I work with if they had been there. Of the five who have been, one said they would go back.",1
"I must confess I love Bonsai! Over the last three years, my partner and I have been going regularly. Most recently last Saturday. n nI love that it's a tiny restaurant and can get very busy and cluttered. I love that the menu hasn't changed all that much over the years and the specials seem to be the same too. n nBonsai serve sushi and hot food and we usually go for a combination of both the crispy salmon skin maki and deep fried spicy tuna being our favourites. But we've never had a bad dish and the quality is always the same excellent. n nI don't go there to be overwhelmed with choice and quality. I go there for yummy food, the company of my friends, a relaxed environment and friendly staff. n nWhat's also great, is during Fringe time when many restaurants are raising the prices and refusing to take bookings Bonsai hold fast with the same prices and a quite strict booking policy it means that when I catch up with my friends we can go somewhere without worrying about getting a table. Note when we went last Saturday, we had booked, and the restaurant was full so it might be worth booking whichever time of year you go! ",2
"The only thing good about this place is the fortune cookies and the free entrees you win when opening. nFirst time visiter Started out by walking in on a Saturday night and the place was dead. That was a bad sign. Placed our ""take out "" order large teriyaki chicken, small honey chicken, and a kids meal 23 total! We were really excited about eating some fresher food than the nearby Panda Express. Took a long time to get our food and when we got it we were missing our spring rolls. The manager gave us a 7 off our next visit. nGot home, and the small entree was THE SAME SIZE AS THE KIDS MEAL. There was NO flavor in the dishes. My 10 year old daughter couldn't even eat her meal cause she was so disgusted. It tasted like those frozen Chinese dinners that you buy at the grocery store. Kids meal had probably like 5 pieces and the small entree had the same amount. They were like chicken fingers from the freezer. I was so disappointed and will ONLY go back one other time cause of the 7 coupon, and the free entree fortune that came in my cookie. nThis place will be gone in a few months.",1
"Filibertos has always been bad but this location is the worst of all. Their service is unfriendly and their food SUCKS. n nI have eaten there twice. The first time I ordered a chili relleno combo. The chili relleno was cold. The beans and rice were flavorless. n nThe second time my husband picked up a couple breakfast burritos. Mine was supposed to be an egg and cheese, no meat. It was loaded with their disgusting pico de gallo mostly onions and had bits of meat in it. So frustrating. n nFilibertos is bad and they know it. But they will never close down because of the drunk asses that crave bad Mexican food in the middle of the night. n nFilibertos is one of those few places in Arizona that give Mexican food a bad name. Shame.",1
"This is embarrassing to write about but it's that important for everyone to know this place is a huge scam! First you have to pay 33 cover for out of towners which is expensive since other clubs have free admission and a limo ride. n nNot to be mean but the girls are not as hot as other places, which my group immediately noticed. Also I WANT TO WARN EVERYONE that 2 of my friends got hustled here so be very wary of anything extra they offer. If you come, avoid anything extra but the smart thing is DONT COME HERE",1
"Honest truth this place is shit. The utensils where dirty, the service was horrible, and even the coffee cream smelled expired. People here were rude! I strongly suggest that this is a bad spot to come to.",1
"Pro's n If there is a line, you can put yourself on the list over the internet. It saves a few minutes. n nCon's n No waiting area at all, minus a bench on the outside, which is useless since it's not covered and it's currently winter. You feel like a cow on the way to the slaughterhouse with the way people are packed in at the restaurant. You also have to try to avoid the doors and running into people eating. n It's always packed and I couldn't imagine going there on a Friday or Saturday. n No yellow American cheese. Their version of American cheese is not as good. n They have a habit of burning burgers bad. They went 2 for 2 in my 2 visits in burning them. n They make you fill out a sheet stating what you want for your burger. It takes too long to fill it out and then they screw it up anyway because no one can understand it. Writing down what you want is the waitress' job, not the customer's. n Want fries with your burger? You're paying extra. n The service is slow and you might as well be playing ""Where's Waldo? "" when its time to find your waitress. n Everyone who works there looks really weird. Tattoos, piercings, hair dye, strange attires, the works. n n nOverall thoughts nNot sure how this place got the best burger in Pittsburgh, but obviously, they paid someone off. It's okay but not on the level of Red Robin or some other great burger places here. This place is an expensive, hippie filled mess and they need to get their act together if they want to grow. The number one thing they need to work on is the waiting area, as you are either packed and trying not to run into people or you're gonna be sitting in the cold outside.",1
"I love Ethiopian food, and I love Cafe Lalibela. Their vegetarian combo plate is always reliably filling and flavorful, and the spiced iced tea hits the spot in the summer weather. My meat eating friends tell me the meat dishes are great as well, but they recommend doing a combo rather than the big plates of just one type. Apparently too much of one gets overwhelming. I alternate between here and Blue Nile because I love them both!",2
Just can't say enough good things about this company! I use them year after year and am always very happy with what they offer. Use them and you won't be disappointed!,2
"This place is the tops. I heartily agree, if you are visiting Steel Town as we were , and especially if you live somewhere lacking in old world ethnic influence as we do , just get here. You will love it. Such a warm and welcoming atmosphere! We felt like it was our place within moments of arrival. I never did catch the owner's name but he was such a great character, a totally perfect barkeep for a totally Polish neighborhood joint with totally excellent comfort food! n nIt's a small place but you can feel free to drag the available tables and chairs to suit your group. We ate at the bar which was just fine. This is a small place, and it's a one man kitchen so don't be looking for fast food here! Ours came out pretty quick anyway. The Polish platter red was the obvious choice and I ate every bite. Oh heavenly pierogi, delectable and hearty stuffed cabbage roll, warm and wonderful noodles, and. the kielbasa. The five star kielbasa. n nI have to mention that my husband, who is 100 Polish and has many, many decades of experience to draw upon, stated for the record that BBT's kielbasa was the BEST kielbasa he had EVER eaten. And that's saying a lot. n nThey've a nice smoking deck, toasty warm and comfy. Kickin' Polish beers available, as well as wondrous blackberry brandy designed for sipping, not slamming. By the benevolent hand of fate I was the 1,000,000th customer and our host provided a round of that cheering spirit in celebration. n nI hated to leave. But vow to return.",2
"They have an amazing Porterhouse here, great cut of meat and prepared just right. I think they fully understand the idea of med well done. I don't like my steak still having a heart beat and they got it right. This is a really classy restaurant and their sides were delicious. Stuffed baked potato.yummy!",2
This Wal Mart have no shopping baskets. Soo I need to use a shopping cart for my three items. They need to clean the parking lot of all the shopping carts more often,1
I have only been here once but was pleased with my mascarpone and spec pizza and fennel salad. The pizza should have been baked at least another 2 minutes because my crust was on the raw side. But I like a crispy crust that holds horizontally. I don't know but maybe they don't make it that well done. I want to go back and try some other salads and a pasta. n nI thought the service was very good. I sat next to a couple of guys who were pretty obnoxious and gave the waitress suggestions on how to improve the menu and she handled it very well.,2
