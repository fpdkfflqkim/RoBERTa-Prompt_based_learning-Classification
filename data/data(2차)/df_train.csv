"I haven't gone on a weekday. but OMG! going there on a Saturday was AWFUL! I was there for 15 mins tops. You are shoulder to shoulder with strangers, you have to fight to get in or out of the door. They have one bar, with one bartender. So there is no way you are going to get a drink. I didn't use the bathrooms, but my friend said they were covered in crap. It was a gross experience. PERIOD.",1
"Meh! n nWe ordered this for room service and they messed up our whole order, but we were already so fed up with this hotel we took what we got and ate.the food was ok.if you like chuck e. cheese pizza. n nthe salad was gross and we asked for ranch and got Italian. n nMy son and dad loved it.thats the only reason for 3 stars",1
It was a dive atmosphere which I like . I played a round of pool. Wings had too much sauce on them and the tenders are the frozen processed kind. I asked to substitute for the popcorn shrimp and they told me they were out. Long Wongs is way better. I wanted to try this place for the first time. It'll be my last,1
"As an update I would like to say that the Olive Garden organization is still 1 5 stars all the way in my book. After I sent them my complaint about the service, they made good by sending me a gift certificate. Although I will NEVER go to THIS particular Olive Garden again, I will gladly spend my money at other Olive Gardens in the area. If only there was one in Mooresville or Statesville!",1
I have been here a few times when it was busy. Got good service and friendly servers. I went there on a Sunday afternoon when it was slow with young new bartender. I sat at the bar while she flirted with a couple roided out guys she was hooked on. I finally just left. I would be back but just was not loving the Sunday afternoon service.,1
Used to be my go to nail place. Today I was treated poorly and lied to. Was told one price and charged another. My big toe is throbbing right now because of the half ass pedicure. Paid extra for callus removal. clearly still rough skin on my feet. Not happy. Will not return or send anymore business their way.,1
"Aside from their good selection of juice, I don't usually like to go here. They are extremely rude and don't really pay attention to the average customer. They normally will just ignore non regulars who come in the store and won't even spit out a simple hello. There are many other shops you can go to in the area with a better atmosphere and better customer service.",1
Stopped in to browse was saying what a great store they had. I hike often have horses so I could have spent a lot of there. Have a friend looking for a kayak asked a simple question about the used kayaks the front . The sales guy gave me a very condescending answer chuckled. I will never go back will spread the word! Thx,1
The staff is lazy and rude. The food is fine but trying to get someones attention or an order right will never happen. The 7th street and Mcdowell location is the worst. The city took away most of the parking meters downtown so you have to pay for the parking garage and between the cost of parking and a mediocre sandwich and horrible service its the easiest decision to never go back.,1
"I am rating this in comparison to Zoyo, Mojo,and Yogurtology. They were out of 3 different flavors leaving mostly just the ""fruity "" ones. They said they are having issues with their supplier. They also have about 1 2 of the toppings that the above 3 have and its the same price.So unless you work downtown and this is within walking distance, head over to Zoyo on 7th.",1
"Stopped in for a drink before a show at the Carnegie Music Hall. Was hit by a wall of vomit sewer aroma when we walked in the door. Horrible, never fully went away the bathrooms smelled better than the main room . As a result, did not try the food. Decent beer list, and enjoyed the dark stormy. But not worth a special trip not worthy of the Chiodo legacy standard for dives in Homestead.",1
Came for dinner. Waited 45 mins for the waitress Tessa to take our order while she was chatting with 2 bar customers. Bad management decision to have a waitress run between the bar and tables so not totally her fault but bad for a customer experience regardless. We decided to leave instead of ordering. Place was mostly empty on a Saturday night so that should have been a clue.,1
"Upon pulling in and dodging the bums begging for change, we made sure the windows were locked and proceeded to go in and grab a red bull a Slurpee. The guy that was working the counter was speaking gibberish as he grabbed my wife's hand to put the change right in her palm.and he still missed. Really? Only in Vegas.",1
really excited to go see the store but wasn't impressed at all. they had really cool items in the store but the place looked like a dump. the showcases are all beat up . from all the money they make in that store they need to renovate the entire store and it's a lot smaller then I expected it to be. also I was upset that no one from the show was there to take pics or anything.,1
"Called on 11 12 13 for an appointment set by Mike for 11 13 at 10 a.m., and this person did not show up nor did he call. I called this business because their ad states that whoever represents this company is an Ahwatukee resident. I hoped someone would show up promptly and quickly. I am very disappointed in this company.",1
"I wish this place was better. In fact, I think it was. At least the mushroom flatbread was. I had it a while back and it was great. I had it three days ago and it pretty much sucked. Mushy, tasteless except for way too many onions. I will go back and try some other things, but what used to be a great dish now blows. On the upside, service was friendly.",1
"You are better off taking a taxi for around the same price. The driver was very rude, we mistakenly heard the incorrect Hotel stop and instead of him apologizing for the misunderstanding. He continues repeating the Hotel over and over lol. then says he even spelled it out.okay.Save yourself a headache and take a taxi",1
Waited for an hour and our food still was not served n nTwo of us waited an hour and had to leave because our food had still not arrived. It's probably a pretty good place to while away an afternoon drinking and finally eating we did see two of the six tables in our area served food over the hour we were there but as a restaurant I would recommend avoiding it for now.,1
"The sales manager, Robert, at extension 101, is rude and dishonest. They won't necessarily lie but they will omit the information that will make you go elsewhere, such as the loop holes they omit to avoid paying claims. Claims department is good people but the sales folks are frauds. And very insulting and rude. I filed complaints under the BBB. Move along and find a better warranty company.",1
"Too expensive. n n3 strong islands for 54?! nWe got lucky bc our local friends got 15 of us in for free with no line. nThey do have craps blackjack tables across the pool. nSmall dance floor areas. n nI do like how it's half indoor and outdoor, very similar to XS. n nLower the drink prices and maybe i'll have more fun!",1
"I love the one in DC so I thought I would go here while on business. What a disaster. The service was horendous. We ordered beet salad, bibb lettuce salad and tuna tartare. Only the tuna tartate was any good. Steaks were cooked well and tasted good but all sides were disappointing. Would not return. For the price I would not chance another visit to a BLT.",1
The service was horrible and the food was even worse. Beans were like wallpaper paste. The chicken tasted like a piece of charcoal right out of the fire. Ceviche not sure what that was didn't look like shrimp to me. I'm usually not a picky person but I won't be back to this place. I ll leave on a positive note.the chips were good.,1
"This grill wasn't really for me. I went with other people who liked loud places like this, but it's not really my style. The food wasn't too bad, but the service was pretty poor. It kept taking a long time for our waiter to come back, although they were kind of busy. Still, I probably wouldn't return here.",1
The worst service possible and if you love everything drenched in olive oil please order anything cause there is no shortage there! Waitress cared less for the plates stacking on my table! Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to never wanna come back and recommend the same for anyone who reads this or I know!,1
"This place is ok for a burger joint. The milkshakes is where it's at, but the burger itself was not to impressive. I was in Vegas and I heard that this place had some good burgers. For the price of the burger, I expected better. nIf by chance you're in San Diego and you want a good burger, stop by a place called Boomerrang's Gourmet Burger",1
"This place is just OK.we have been in there a couple of times. I have tried the pizza, wings, baked ziti, lasagne and of course garlic knots. I would say the food is average. A bit overpriced IMO for what you are getting. It isnt my first choice for pizza. I will say that the individuals tvs at the table are pretty cool though.",1
"Well, the nicest thing I guess I can say about the Luxor is that their bathroom was clean. I just absolutely refuse to use the bathroom at the Excalibur so we made the extra walk, just barely and made it to the Luxor. n nI did notice that their light that shines into the night sky is barely a fraction of what it used to be. Hardly a landmark hotel anymore I guess.",1
"Every time I go here something gets stolen. First it was my friends purse, then the next time it was my friends jacket. Last night it was my jacket along with my other friends jacket. I have no idea what is going on here but everyone agrees this place is shady and at this point it seems too coincidental. Beware and good luck.",1
The worst hotel I have been as far as guest services checking in . We got here few hours ago and they said that the room that we reserved is no longer available. The manager was extremity rude and they were not willing to give us a better room. We ended up paying more for a smaller room. I would never come back here to stay.,1
"Spend your money else where! This place shouldn't even get one star! I came in there on a Monday night about an hour before they closed wanting a polish change and some chick who looks like a witch, looked at me crazy and said ""no we're bout to close "" with a nasty attitude. Don't even bother going here unless you don't mind feeling uncomfortable.",1
"This would be a great place except for one thing, everything is in french. Now this is great if you are looking for french manga, but in Montreal you'd think they could have some english manga, among their collection of 3000 books. So if you're looking for english manga, there is absolutly none to be had here, just book shelves and book shelves of dissapointment.",1
"Walking into the restaurant I was immediately in love with the atmosphere and the concept. Unfortunately, I was unable to order any food because I was immediately mocked and humiliated by the chefs at the food stations. Before leaving, I brought it to the managers attention who was apologetic but not phased by his employees unprofessional behavior. Still bummed and upset.",1
"Worst customer service. Waiting over an hour for my ""freaky fast "" food to be delivered. Days later, I realized my credit card was charged incorrectly. Instead of the management being customer service orientated and making it an easy situation to fix they were the exact opposite. I will never be returning, nor would I recommend it to any friends or families in the neighborhood.",1
"FLIES EVERYWHERE! Ick. I don't like having to fight with the flies for the first bite of my food. Not to mention the pizza makes me sick every time I go. If the flies in the dining room are any indication of the conditions of the kitchen, I think I'm better off eating elsewhere. n nThe one star is because they have awesome happy hour beer prices and a huge selection of beers on tap.",1
"I ordered bun Bo hue remembering from a year ago how tasty it was. Boy, thing has changed for the worst. Their bun Bo hue was so bland, their broth tasted like it was run down and the meat was stale furthermore, it was not the correct meat combination a bun bo hue should have. To sum it up, it tasted nothing like Bun Bo hue. I was very disappointed. However, their service was a four star.",1
"The noise from the air vent was simply unbearable and there was no way to turn it off. I was told the problem ""might "" be able to fixed but still ended up suffering three nights of insomnia. n nOn top of that, the shower handle was broken the morning we were ready to check out. Needless to say, we didn't take any shower. The room may look pretty but it ain't worth the money.",1
"Incredibly underwhelming, and I am a baked sweets FIEND. Texture was rubbery, taste was not very sweet at all and generally grainy, frosting tasted too milky for a good buttercream. Very small cupcake for the price. n nIf offered these again, I wouldn't take them. I've gotten much better cupcakes from a grocery store bakery.",1
"WARNING! Contract is very tricky. They have you sign in 11 different spots. ""I decline "" for the first 6, then the 7th is AGREEING to roadside service for additional charges. Then the lighting is so dark in the garage, you can't see any damage to the car. This car rental company is slimy. Rent elsewhere.",1
"I have been here quite a few times and it is either a hit or miss. Happy hour is about the only reason I would go here anymore. Fish cakes and pork tacos are delicious. But I have had more things that I have been disappointed in with this restaurant. Also, their service is hit or miss I have had some of the worst service of my entire life at this restaurant.",1
"Had lunch today, ordered a pastrami on rye, sandwich came and was very fat and salty and the meat seemed like it was sitting in a Luke warm steamer for hours. I wouldn't recommend their meat thought it was awful not worth any price. My wife and I are visiting Scottsdale and have eaten at a bunch of Jewish style delis and this was the first one that was not worth returning to.p",1
"My experience is based on Sunday Brunch n nAlthough the food was good, it was way over priced for brunch. Coming from DC, I've experience much better brunch cafe's that included bottomless insert alcoholic brunch drunk here and cheaper which says a lot comparing Pittsburgh to DC. n nI'd go back, but it's not on the top of my list.",1
"The worst experience. She made us wait more than 2 hours before seeing her. This happened more than once. After the first time I decided to give them a second try, just in case I was an exception on a busy day. But after the second appointment and talking to other patients, I realized this is a norm for this doctor to make you wait HOURS. I'll NEVER go back to her office.",1
"Dear kafein, n nI wanted to give you 5 stars, I miss your shisha days. You had the best vibes , comfy couches, dark ambiance, old school jams. Why did you have to change? I don't really see the point of coming back to you now. I had some of the best times in your basement. Maybe i'll make a short visit and try one of your sandwiches upstairs.",1
"Ok it just get worse and worse! Charlotte simply just does not have good pizza Ive tried alot of different places and the pizza is either BAD or just ok. Jets falls in the category of just ok reminded me of a step above little caesars.But i would prefer lil caesars at least its cheap. I wont be eating here again, Might as well just go to Dominos or wolfman",1
"The nerdy girl in the glasses that kept leaning over showing her ass crack to the entire bar was completely rude and ruined my experience. n nAlso, it's cool that all your friends from the Scottsdale Whole Foods came down for a beer, but stop chatting and get me my damn beer, I mean there were only 20 of you behind a tiny bar. n nVery upsetting considering I love the Chandler bar.",1
What a bad time! We had reservations for 930 and didn't get seated until 10.well we got seated at a temporary table until the table we were supposed to have was ready.then we moved again! They didn't get ANY of the food right! Some of us didn't eat at all. We all left hungry. My ribs were good but fatty.not worth 20. I will not be returning. One star for decor.,1
"It's a small store with quirky zombie apocalypse products. Not the most fun place, but there are some interesting items like army issued backpacks. There's also an arcade like zombie shooting game in store, as well as a zombie scene set up in front of the store to check out. Furthermore, there is a shooting experience package if one is so inclined to practice for the zombie apocalypse.",1
"Very disappointed, for the 2nd order in a row we did not receive an item we ordered, last time it was the stuffed cheese bread, we let that slide, this time an entire pizza was missing, the white sauce with Philly steak and mushrooms did not arrive with the first driver, we had to wait another 30 minutes for the 2nd pizza to arrive, very disappointing.",1
Worst frozen yogurt place I have been to yet. Usually no problem with places but this place was worth the bad review. The customer service was very rude to my group of people. Pricey and the people at yogurt places are usually a little more happy but she was rude and didn't care about her attitude towards anyone.,1
"We used to go to this place a bunch, but then we realized that we shouldn't be wasting our time going to a tiny overpriced bar where a bunch of drunk dudes ogled the girls that were paid to stand on the bar and be flirty. Entertaining the first few times, and free for locals, so it's not all bad. But there's better places to spend your time in Vegas.",1
"Went here for restaurant week. It wasn't as bad as most these reviews make it out to be. n nThe service is OK. n nThe food is really good. n nThe frozen hotcocolate is over rated, good, but not amazing. n nso overall as long as the service isn't terrible and my wait isn't too long l but the food is bombdigity, I'm ok witht that.",2
"Jack talk Thai? Jack talk Thai, real well. Great Thai, in the higher priced to portion sized but worth it. Drinks are no joke, a double is 24, so idk if that's the best place to drink it up, but the food is the best Thai I've had in AZ. nROTI,Pad Thai, Garlic Shrimp all really good, nPlus probably the most beautiful hostess I've ever seen. nEnjoy",2
"Nous avons dormis 5 nuits dans la chambre 218. nLa chambre u00e9tait irr u00e9prochablement propre et c'est tr u00e8s rare que je dis u00e7a d'un hotel. L' u00e9toile en moins c'est parce qu'il y a aucune insonorisation dans le passage, nous sommes chanceux il y avait que des gens tranquille, mais vraiment aucune insonorisation.",2
"Store isn't the same since the climbing rock wall closed. It is nicely stocked with camping and sporting equipment, spacious, spread out and the staff friendly. It's a two story facility so there is plenty of areas to explore, I was surprise to see the prices of the treadmills, they have the best of the best for those prices. Other items seem reasonably priced.",2
1st time trying this buffet and I'm not really much of a fan for buffets but it was good. Def worth a revisit and mainly because of the unlimited Krab leg. Some of the other dishes were good. Some weren't. But I tried a little bit of everything and for 22.99 a person I'll say it was worth every dollar.,2
"Still great after all these years! Now even better that they are open 24 7. Menu has not changed a lot, but there was no need. n nThe Pan Roast is still my favorite, but you can't find fresher oyster in the desert than here! n nThe cook and the waitress are always friendly, so tip them well, they work non stop!",2
"Awesome place. beautiful rooms. the pool area seemed awesome but we were there for only 3 days and there was so much to see. the service was great and the stay was great, I got the player club card and was comped a free breakfast buffet, the day we left, so I have to go back beore it expires. haha! n nI love it and I want to go back!",2
"We had heard that you can't visit Montreal without trying frites, and this was a recommended place. They were very good, and Frites Alors offered a variety of sauces for us to sample. Our server was also very friendly and, recognizing we were from out of town, spent time explaining the menu and our meal to us.",2
"Carlyn's is everything most guys expect in a Barber Shop Clean, simple decor, one chair, a very competent barber, and good conversation! So convenient too to the downtown. Usually in early afternoon I get right in. Just off the sidewalk in the Mill Avenue Shops by Fatburger. Under 20, but cash only so be prepared.",2
"I've eaten here on two of my visits to Phoenix and I've been impressed both times. The food is really tasty and it comes from a unique menu, which I love! The drinks are also really creative. My only criticism is that they're a little pricey but they're really not THAT expensive. A lunch for two, including an appetizer and drinks, was around 60. Overall, both times were enjoyable experiences.",2
"As a thrift store aficionado, I know a good thrift store when I see one. And this is one of the best. Lots of great stuff from furniture to housewares to books though I didn't sort through the clothes . This store has one of the best organizational systems for books that I've ever seen and they're all very reasonably priced. Highly recommend!",2
"I love the food, I love the service, and I love the prices. I use Restaurant.com to get a discount to this place. The Pad Thai is decent, The Panang is Awesome! The Pad See Ewe is good too. That is pretty much all I ever order, so I have no opinion on other dishes. It is not the best I ever had, but it is darn good and with the friendly and fast service, and great price, you can't go wrong!",2
"so fun! this place now take visa's, as i was just reading another review that said they didn't. OK, so I'm gonna out myself. I'm not gay , but still had the best time here. everyone is super friendly, and just looking for a good time, and good music to dance to. i now crave going to this spot with friends. i would definitely recommend anyone was wants to have fun to visit the Girl Club.",2
"Went to the Wine Warehouse on a Groupon, received a wine tasting and meat and cheese platter. The wine was awesome! For the meat and cheese platter you got 1 piece of pepperoni and 1 piece of salami, so that was a little lame. However, the server was really knowledgable and fun. The store offers a huge variety of wines and has a nice atmosphere, would go back and recommend for a relaxing night!",2
"I came across the postings for Hot n Juicy crawfish and I just had to go try. nYummy! I had a pound of crawfish Hot n Juicy. It was very tasty and the price was very reasonable 9.99 for a lb . n nI only gave 4 stars since they didn't have gumbo and the service was pretty slow even though it was Sunday afternoon, and only 4 groups in the store.",2
"With so many places to eat in Vegas, I'm always looking for suggestions. My coworkers unanimously sent me here, and they weren't wrong. The pizza was great thin, crispy and cheesy! The prices were fine for what you got, and we didn't have any problems finding a seat during lunch hours. I'll definitely be back when I'm in town again.",2
"As I Hops go, it is pretty typical. My wife loves getting breakfast there at all times of the day. I've had both breakfasts and lunches .mostly sandwiches. nothing great, but it's passable. The waitresses are usually good, cheerful, and attentive tho occasionally you get a clinker .but that happens everywhere . These are hard working ladies so leave them a reasonable tip.",2
I just realized I have not been too one of these places in a year. Last two times they cut the bagel wrong. And gave me an attitude when I asked them to fix it. It's my money and u want it my way if I'm paying. Se e review I left at two other locations. The guy here was cool and did his job right and my meal was awesome. While Einstein isn't my favorite its damn good,2
"Very nice resort. Staff was friendly and responsive. We stayed in a King suite with a view of pool area looking west to mountains. Room was fantastic well appointed. Among the few, would certainly recommend. The Venetian and the Palazzo are connected via the Canal Shops. Many quality restaurants and shops.",2
Farmer Boys is in between fast food and a traditional restaurant. The large dining area and plenty of tables booths make you feel like you can take a break and relax for awhile instead of gobbling down your meal. nBe prepared to wait 10 20 minutes for your meal to be brought to your table. nFood is fresh so it is worth the wait. nThey serve breakfast all day.,2
"This is the hotel that made me fall in love with Phoenix. I stayed here three times before I moved here, and each time was delightful. The views of the mountains, the classic Hilton comfy beds, the pools, the convenience to downtown. n nNow that I live here, I still like to take hotel minibreaks, esp in the summer when the rates drop. I'll be coming here again.",2
This is by far our favorite restaurant anywhere close to the Carolina Place Mall. You cannot go wrong with any of the BBQ. My wife can't bring herself to order anything but the pulled pork. n nI love both the BBQ chicken and the pulled pork. I also really like the grilled mixed vegetables as a substitute for the sweet potato fries.,2
"I love steaks and mine here was the second best I have ever had. I had the free ranch rib eye well done. And it was cooked perfectly. The inside looks like a Steak House should, all dark and full of wood. The service was amazing. They work in teams and are always there when you need a dink or anything else. The only downside is the sides are pretty small.",2
"Beer is solid, food offerings the night our group was there were a little off. Not as tasty as others have told me about. I'm all for going back and trying more of the menu offerings, especially when there's trivia. The space lends itself well to it, and Amy who hosted the night we were there ROCKED!",2
"This review is pretty much just for the frozen hot chocolate I tried and all the delicious looking food around me as I ate it. I had the peanut butter one and as a peanut butter fanatic it was soooo good! nI also tried their walk up ordering outside and I was less than impressed with everything there. If you go, go inside and order a frozen hot chocolate! It is a bit pricey though",2
"Great food, reasonable prices, good service. Crawfish and shrimp by the pound. Three sauces as I recall with three heat levels for each. I had the signature ""Hot Juicy "" sauce, but got mild because I was not alone. On my own I'd probably get medium. Great flavor. Be ready to get messy. They provide paper towels and bibs.you'll need them. n nThis is on my list anytime I return to Vegas.",2
"It is sad that when I used to live in Chandler I never visited this place. Their beers are ok, although I like more the 4peaks heffeweizen. There was one, that definitely should be a joke.the smokey beer or something like that. Don't order that one I guess u have to smoke cigars to appreciate the nasty flavor . n nNice location, and downtown Chandler is a good excuse to stop by this place.",2
"The Eye Candy Sound Lounge and Bar was a cool laid back alternative than going to a full fledged ""club "" The vibe is good here and the drinks are strong. They play a little over everything here but its primarily hip hop. Age ranges from young 21 year old up to old farts like myself but I would say for the most part its mostly the 25 40 year old crowd here.",2
"I can't get enough of this place! Love going there a few times a week. Lunch, dinner and the brunch on weekends AMAZING! I have had pretty much everything on the menu and each and everything is delicious! Whether you want to sit at the bar and have one of their incredible cocktails or sit on the patio and get some fresh air. A must go to nSpot on the west side!",2
"We gave it a try and we were happy. Loved the wine selection. My friend is very particular about her wine and the sommlier was very knowledgable and recommended a great wine. We tried the cheese tray and did a few appetizers, all were excellent. We've also gone back just for drinks and have had a great time. The staff is friendly and warm.",2
"A must on any visit to Jean Talon Market and my favourite crepe spot in Montreal, mostly because the crepes served here feel authentically Qu u00e9b u00e9cois. Egg and ham, apple and maple syrup, potato and something. everything on the menu is simple, yet delicious. Plus, they do buckwheat creeps, which are gluten free! Stop by and give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",2
"If international conflict were determined by 1950's cocktails, I'm pretty sure Tornado's Old Fashioned could create world peace. n nMuddled cherries, perfect bittered tartness, and brandy, because we're in Wisconsin, dammit! n nCheck out the late night menu, because you aren't going to be stuffing your face from 10pm 1am with this much class anywhere else.",2
"Went there on a Saturday afternoon, this is a delightful neighborhood Italian place with friendly service, good if not great food and reasonable prices. I had the vegetable soup homemade and delicious along with chicken and brocolli rigatoni with a flavorful alfredo sauce and some of the best crusty garlic bread I've had in a while. Give them a try, you'll add them to your list like I did.",2
"I met up with some girlfriends during a pretty busy lunch rush. The service was spectacular and didn't miss a beat even though every table was taken. n nThe rosemary chicken sandwich was awesome. The chicken phyllo apps were delish as well, loved the dipping sauce that came w them. n n Our servers suggestions were spot on.",2
"I Would like to wish these guy's a HAPPY 2 Year ANNIVERSARY .I stop in here for really tasty cookies every chance I can. n nI also LOVE the GOB's ! If eating these treats took weight off , I would weigh 14 lbs, but they don't , and I have to behave. n nIf you are on Murray Ave, Please treat yourself to a delicious fun desert and say Happy Anniversary !",2
Came in here for some bachelorette supplies and boy did I score some fun stuff! The staff that works here is super friendly and helpful. Its always fun to visit this store. They have a great selection of gag gifts for the bride to be. They were a total hit! nCant wait for the next event that brings me into the store.,2
"Honestly it's just ridiculous how good this place is. Every entree there is fantastic, their chefs are amazingly talented, their wait staff is good, and their sushi is creative and dynamic. We live about 5 minutes away and literally eat here 3 4 times a week. The late night special after 11 30pm is an incredible deal as well.",2
Fantastic food and very cool atmosphere! Recommend the pretzel fondue.enough to share.very yummy. Wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu and was so right on about all our picks! Had the meatloaf and was floored.just delicious.best I have ever had at a restaurant. Friends had the fried chicken and cleaned their plates.can't wait to come back!,2
"I love this place. They hook up the toppings. The pizza is just plain good! If you are tired of Pizza Hut, Domino's and Metro Pizza, this is the place to be. It's the best pizza on the Southwest side. Plus the people who work there are very friendly and helpful. n nMake sure you get the managers special for 17.99 and their best pizza is the hawaiian.",2
"Third time is the charm.still great and consistent! n nIf you are in the mood for sushi during ""off peak "" hours e.g., in between lunch and dinner , Yama is open! I was starting to get hungry around 3pm and I tried 3 different places and by the time I arrived at each place they were closed between lunch and dinner. I guess I was meant to eat at Yama.",2
"These guys did 2 paver jobs for me, we did most of our own landscape installation at our homes but I would rather hire someone to do the pavers and these guys did a fantastic job for a great price. I was able to get ahold of Dave right away and his bid came a few days after he met with me. He mostly works out of the east valley and completes his jobs in a timely manner.",2
"The best sandwich joint out there. I am a huge fan of a good sandwich place and this one took the cake. We ordered ""The Original "", ""Italian "", and ""The Club "" my favorite was the original with the amazing Horsey sauce! But let's face it, for less than 6 a sandwich on the strip, you can't go wrong here. Extremely satisfied and glad to have taken advantage of the experience.",2
"What more is there to say that hasn't been said already? I come here almost every time I visit Vegas. Omelets are made with half a dozen eggs and they're awesome. And of course, absolutely order the banana bread. I honestly think it's the best banana bread I've ever had. On the other hand I finally tried the pumpkin bread and it's just a much tamer version of the previous. So skip out on this.",2
This place is soo cool. A group of us were waiting for a shuttle to the strip butit never came so we partied all night at GeeBees. We bought so many drinks and food and the bill only came out to 60. I would go to vegas just to go back there again. We had such a good time there. And the guys played shuffleboard so the girls could have a good time. 10 off if you have a timeshare at worldmark.,2
"I have been here about 4 times and it's pretty good food. I don't think so far its good enough to pay regular prices, but I am pretty picky. I have gone most of the time during happy hour and the prices are reasonable. I love the queso dip.They have a good assortment of appetizers. I like the layout of the restaurant. It's a good place for a casual meal, to watch a game and or just to hang out.",2
"Yummooo! This place is simple and delicious! The chicken taco, and veggie taco were delicious! I wasn't to fond of the pork. Hubby had the burger which he raved about and the fries were tasty! We also had the banana shake which was yum! The staff was super friendly, the place is clean and seemed to be well organised! The pricing is decent as well! Would definitely go back!",2
"I was seen in a timely manner. I thought I had broken my hand and with the on site X ray machine, my suspicions were confirmed. The doctor was polite and funny. If you don't have a GP or are a tourist I would suggest going here over the hospital across the street. I was patched up and sent on my way in about an hour.",2
"Excellent fast mexican food, and the staff is super friendly. The Super Burrito is the equivalent of the Carne Asada plate wrapped in a tortilla. My wife ordered the Machaca plate it was tasty and she was unable to eat it all.as for decor, it's basic but very clean. We will definitely eat here again.",2
Been here about 4x now close to my work. I had heard they had fantastic tacos and they DO. Love the blend of Mexican Korean fusion. Flavors are awesome. Go try it out you won't be disappointed and you can walk out for less than 10. I keep going back to tacos had the burrito once. Bulgogi tacos so good. Service for the limited staff just excellent they take care of you.,2
