"Well the new post office in Queen Creek open last week and I have to say the office and ground are nice. But there is still this very big problem. n nTHE SERVICE PEOPLE who work there must be the slowest people in AZ. n nI gave them the benefit in old post office due to the size that must be some of problem, but no it is not. n n nSo Mr Postmaster what do you have say to service to service you offer in QC. n nWhere are Kiosk's nWhere is the self service machine nWhere are you friendly workers n nWhere or Where is the service? n nMy business will always go to the UPS store in QC , where the service and people are very customer service friendly and speedy. n nAnd yes they will process all US Mail. n nNo wonder the USPS can't make any money it run by Moron's",1
"I used to be a loyal men's warehouse shopper. I had a casual job and only needed to wear suits sporadically. I have recently taken a job where I have to dress formally everyday. I was in the store to buy a few new suits and am very unhappy with how one of them fits. I feel like a 10 year old wearing my dads suit. It is gigantic. After a few alterations the suit still felt big. When I had it altered initially I mentioned that the suit was huge and the store associate darla said it looked good and they couldn't take it in anymore. A few weeks later I wore the suit once and it was horrible. Jacket was too long and the pants made me feel like I was wearing a tent. I took it back. They said they could alter it. The staff was not apologetic for not doing it right the first time and overall the team was very unfriendly. Like I was an inconvenience in their day. They said they could alter it would cost me another 15 and would take almost 10 days. I will get this suit, but will not be buying anything here again. The sales lady was constantly blaming the other tailors for doing a poor job and said the best tailor was back and that the other tailors were not very good. I will not be back. If this is how your staff treat each other. No wonder the client experience was so poor. Epic fail.",1
Yelp is showing this place as being in the North Hills but it's actually located in Homestead 135 E 8th Ave!,2
"Only going 4 stars 'cuz no self respecting BBQ joint would want a 5 star rating. n nStopped in here today based on previous Yelp reviews and let's face it. it's just too hot to do a proper BBQ brisket and not get paid for it I called my buddy up and we agreed to meet here for lunch. n nIt was a good call n nTHE PARKING LOT SMELLED AWESOME. smokers ablaze and hints of what was to come. my English teacher would have called it foreshadowing. n nI arrived first and was happy to see there were some customers already at the bar and in a few of the tables around 1PM on a Saturday afternoon. It's always a little daunting when I walk in and am the only guy in the place. As soon as I walked in, I saw a guy sitting at one of the tables jump up as if to greet me but I gave the ""I'm going to the bar "" signal and he was all ""cool "". A plus in my book today as it told me right away that they are a little less formal than your regular restaurant, but still want you to feel immediately welcome. like showing up at a BBQ should be. n nI walked down the length of the bar, past a few regulars and overheard conversations of vacations in the islands and a few comments that sounded like ""MMMM. you gotta try this. wait, never mind, get yer own. "" etc. until I found a couple of open stools. I snatched 'em up and was instantly greeted by a bartender singing lines of county songs and twinkling her eyes as if to say ""Heya "". She got me a beer and I looked over the menu while I waited for my buddy. In the time I waited, she didn't pressure me with the ""specials "" or even really offer much about the place, and normally I would kind of like a little guidance in a new place, but this is BBQ. if you don't know BBQ, what the hell are you doing in a BBQ joint?! I was cool with it What I really liked was that while there were some TV's and such to occupy my wandering eye, the place was also EXCELLENTLY decorated with light fixtures with actual fillaments. some in mason jars, some in old fan housings. There were overhead beams of solid wood and metal that gave a standard strip mall space some REAL character. I gotta say they put some good thought into the design. And while there are TV's, they were not in the way to distract you from the people you came to enjoy a meal with. That said, this is not the place to come watch TV. n nBuddy arrived and we were both happy with the choices on the menu. PLENTY to choose from. All the standards and a few unique items to choose from. I got the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and chips. The coleslaw was NOT on the side. it was on the SANDWICH as it should be for a proper pulled pork sandwich. And I gotta say the bun was perfect. It was bakery fresh and toasted and held up until the very last bite. never got soggy and never fell apart. even though my face and hands were almost always in need of a napkin. The pork was tender, JUICY, and the sauce was the right mix of sweet, savory, and smoke. though I would usually add some spice living in the southwest. but it was a nice change of pace and reminded me of what BBQ is like in the rest of the country. Didn't realize I missed it 'till I had it again. n nMy buddy had some really tasy Beef Brisket. Now he and I are known in our circle of friends as being able to produce some excellent smoked brisket, so I am always wary of ordering this from a restaurant as its just a difficult thing to keep moist, smokey, and tender if you don't pay attention to the details. A couple bites and I think we agreed these folks are doing it well. Better than most really, in my humble opinion. Certainly better than I've had outside of my or my buddy's backyard. n nI also ordered a shot of the house homemade apple pie moonshine. Lemme tell ya fellas, get one. Just shut up and get one. Good stuff. You'll think it has no alcohol at all but me and the buddy just spilt it to see what it tasted like and we could both feel its affects in a minute or two. SMOOTH is not the word for it. more like sneaky! n nWe also tried the Mac n' Cheese. which was almost overkill at this point but still. a must try. served in a cast iron skillet, with fusilli pasta instead of the usual elbow macaroni, it was a great side to put things just over the top. Creamy, no usual breadding to get in the way, but a nicely browned cheese topping to again bring a little of the BBQ to the dish. n nWe maxed out and leaned back in our barstools. and had a couple more beers. n nThanks for lunch, Bootleggers. Bettin' we'll be back again soon.",2
I understand that they have a new manager. Seems like an energetic individual. The food was very good and was served quickly. I would give it a try.,2
"Back when I discovered Teharu in 2008 didn't discover Yelp until 2009 , it was still this secret little gem that I slowly introduced to all my friends and family wait, could this all be my fault?! But now, it seems during any meal time, there's quite a long wait, and not enough staff. And when you do finally get a seat, the selection on the belt is pretty limited since most of the popular stuff goes fast. n nI was just recently here with some friends and we waited about 15 mins to seat us 3 people . I've been coming here intermittently I no longer live in the US but the last few times I've gone, it's just been disappointing. Normally, the staff is forgetful, slow and useless, but at least the last time I went the staff was fairly competent. But we ended up having to order some rolls and the most basic of our order a crunch roll. c'mon, a california roll with tempura flakes took the longest. So long that we asked 3 different servers, and it actually took about 30 minutes to come when the chefs finally made a batch to put on the belts . But any time you order something expect it to take a while. n nI hope that they improve the service here I always loved Teharu, fairly decent sushi at really cheap prices. Not the best, but definitely the most fun. I want to keep loving Teharu. please improve!",1
I agree with what others have to say here. The shop is very nice but the owner will try everything to extract money from you. I went there about 4 years ago to become a certified scuba diver. After initially signing in the owner convinced me to buy some gear which till now I haven't used. After the initial few classes he started telling me I should buy my own tank and BCD because my life depends on it. The trick he employs is that he keeps some really very old almost broken down equipment for training and says that unless you buy his shiny new equipment you will have to get certified in the old equipment. The reason he gives is that if you go to any of the other scuba sites they have this very old equipment and it is better to train in that unless I buy equipment from him. Once a person dropped in to class to return a leaking cylinder which that person rented from him. He then started telling me this is why I should buy my own cylinder since the person had to come back from his vacation because of his leaking cylinder and this wouldn't have happened if he had bought and maintained his own tank. To make things worse there was very little training since most of the time he was trying to sell his overpriced equipment. He also tried to sell me a vacation package which he and his girlfriend was going to and told me that other people in the class were also going to there were really no other people in the class . The vacation was of course overpriced and I felt he was trying to get me to pay for all 3 of us. I very soon cut my losses and left the classes and got certified at another place where the divers told me that this guy had spent time in prison. Never go here.,1
"I went here on a Friday night with a group of people. We were mostly just drinking beer, but then we decided to have a round of shots. Originally we were going to do shots of tequila, but they were out of silver tequila. We then decided on having lemon drops. The bartender then complained that he hated making these shots, so he was going to have one if he had to make them. Too bad he couldn't correctly make a lemon drop. Myself and one other person then asked if we could do the shake of the day. He said we could and then walked away. He didn't really appear to be doing anything at that point. When he finally came back by us it was to get a drink for the guy next to us. We asked again about the shake of the day. He then said, ""I'm too busy for that. You'll have to do that some other day. "" The funny thing is that they weren't that busy. There was really no justification for him snapping at us or not having the time to do anything. n nThis bar manages to get worse though. The women's bathroom doesn't have a lock on the door. There were two times during the hour and a half when I was there were women had the door opened on them. I would suggest doing what we did and having someone stay outside the door for you.",1
You know the club is suffering if they are handing out wristbands right outside Paris. Girls get in for free with wristbands and guys do too. just as long as the guys get in before midnight. After midnight? Tough luck. Be ready to cough up 30. I would save my money and try my luck at a different club. Plenty of other better clubs in Vegas. Save your time money.,1
Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl. Great service. Very convenient to downtown hotels.,2
"I'm not sure why we come back, but this will be the last time. Service is horrible. Still sitting here waiting for food. Still missing half our order. Keep asking but being brushed off. There is no rush as all the tables around us, whom have arrived around the same time, have all their food and almost finished. The table which arrived after us, who are clearly friends or staff are also almost finished their meal as well. 3different waiters and a manager, no apologies as of yet. They clear don't care and they clearly don't care if we ever come back so we won't.",1
"Tastes great if you're starving but your stomach says ""you'll be oh so sorry "" afterwards. Not a lot of healthy choices, sky high calorie counts, and your money is going to a gigantic corporation rather than supporting your local community. At least they're going to start posting the calories at the cashier but don't be fooled. Even if you order a salad, the dressings have about 18 grams of fat! Anyway, there are so many other wiser choices even when you're in a hurry. Methinks not unless you need WIFI in a pinch.",1
"Needed a car for Vegas, and since we flew Southwest, they recommended us to use this company. We looked at a quote online and it was supposed to be about 30 a day and our total turned out to be 375! n nSo tip 1 make sure your drivers license is not expired! They did not accept my boyfriend's ID, so I had to use mine, and since I'm under 25, they charged me 75 A DAY extra. n nTip 2 DO NOT get the prepaid gas. It's a rip off. The strip is close to everything and you do not need a whole tank of gas. n nTip 3 Check with your insurance or credit card to see if they cover your car rentals, because this is a rip off too! n nWhat was supposed to be 90 turned out to be 4 times as much.",1
"All of the reviews here are spot on! I agree with every one star review but I believe everyone is looking at this wrong. n nThis bar is the closest bar to your gate. People hit this place for a quick drink before they get on there plane. It does get messy in here because it gets hit hard by the travelers. The rude bartender is dealing with drunk people who have just spent there last few days in Vegas. That has to be annoying for the bartender. Think of him! n nIf you come here, then set your expectations low. Go to the bar, order your drink, enjoy it and get on your flight! Go in with this game plan and this place could be 5 stars! I think the Johnny Walker in me is talking!",2
Got my make up done here by Anthony and let me tell u he is a GOD WHEN IT COMES TO EYEBROWS . He is very fun and professional and very good at what he does. He left me looking like a doll. Will always come back to him . Love the forum shops also lol and this sephora,2
"My all time favorite place to eat anywhere. I have no complaints. Let's see n n Best burgers I've ever had. Spring for the American Kobe beef patty, it's so very worth it. Everywhere else I order burgers medium well or well done, but this one is deserving of a medium or medium rare. Delicious. n Best beer list I've seen in a while. All sorts of good things to try and tons on tap. I think the tap is like 6 8 feet long. n Sports on TV, including personal TVs in the booths. n Awesome toppings for the burgers and the fried stuff is so damn tasty. n Nice servers and friendly bartenders. Sometimes the host stand staff can seem a little ""inexperienced "" but that doesn't detract from the dining experience. n nJust so freakin' good. I can't say enough about this place. I've dragged people all the way down from the Las Vegas Hilton just to have dinner here. Yummy yummy yummy!",2
"Very good rolls, actually had some items that my kids ate and liked. Inexpensive. Not really kids friendly, small tight tables.",2
"I agree with previews posters who said the place is overpriced expensive, tiny portions which do not taste all that great. I do not mind paying a lot of money for great food but what they serve is not worth the they charge for it at all. I would not go back anyway but on top of it, I got food poisoning there. I threw up eight times several hours after eating there. My husband tried to reported it to them. The restaurant was closed at the time when he called and they did not even bother to call back. Bad experience on every level, except the service was OK!",1
"First you should know how your agents be have during my recent 8,000 mile trip. nFirst I arrived at the airport in alaska, we were rerouted to american airlines even tho we purchased tickets though us airways. I had to pay for my baggage to Costa Rica I didn't have to pay for it on the way back they told me it was part of the US so I had to pay for baggage. I was only allowed to check in 30 mintues early for an international flight really?! . Then on the first flight we had an exit row which was very cold. I ask a flight attendant for a blanket in which he responded ""I will have to ask a first class passanger if they are willing to part will a blanket "" I said don't bother the first class passangers. nTo follow the flight attendants we rude or very short. No notice from the pilot when we were about to land either from the flight there or back. nThe flight back was a bit more annoying. First departing from costa rica after we had gone threw the security we were not allowed to bring anything on the plane to drink. And even more so there was nothing not even a small snack offered to eat on a 5 hr flight enough tho the flight attendants were carrying food from one end of the plane to another so the flight attendants could eat but no one else. I am still in shock that no food even peanuts for paying customers was offered on a 5 hour flight. I will honestly say I will never fly American airways or us airways again.",1
"I saw there wasn't a listing for the new location, so I figured I'd add it! n nBeing a regular, I visit this place just about every Thursday. n nThe staff is excellent, while the tables can sometimes be a little messy, their are plently of napkins to clean up. n nTheir food is always great, the chicken can be a little dry sometimes, which is why I always get the grilled fish tacos, with a side order of hot shrimp. n nTheir salsa is excellent as well, and their beer selection is modest, but they have something for everyone. n nThis is an excellent place to go and decompress after a hard day of work.",2
"Probably has to be one of the worst sit down restaurant experiences I've ever had. The service is overlook able. i ordered the beef noodle pho. The broth itself is pretty bland and felt like a chore to eat. It was a herbal beef broth with a slight sweet taste to it. Nothing special. The noodles were alright and the vegetables Bean sprouts, cilantro, onion the lime was a little dry were fresh. n nThe bad rating comes from the beef. The actual beef muscle was okay but the beef tendon tasted pretty spoiled. I've eaten soups, including herbal soups with beef tendon. That did not come close to the weird nasty taste this tendon had. Quite overpriced as well. Better similar prices in other locations. Would recommend New China Cuisine right across the street. Kinda similar but at least the beef was decent quality and the portions are great.",1
"Had lunch at Blu Burger yesterday. I ordered the chicken pear salad. My sister in law had the cobb salad and our husband's had burgers. They loved their meals. My sister in law said the sweet potato fries were the best she ever had and both guys thought their burgers were great. My salad was ""decent "". It was HUGE. And the goat cheese was in giant chunks. so if you got a bite of it you were eating an ounce at a time of cheese. Hard to taste anything else. The chicken was dry and overcooked. the dressing was really good. n nThey are getting a two from me based on my food only and on the service. When we got there they had a total of about six tables. Our waiter had the demeanor of a guy who'd rather be anywhwere else. He told me they ""ran out of coffee "" this morning meaning ""I don't want to make any "". 45 minutes after ordering I went and asked where our food was. By this time there were three tables in the place and our food still did't arrive for about ten minutes.",1
One the most happening nightspots in Vegas. I always hit this place up Guestlist is highly recommended. I like the outdoor patio over looking the mid Vegas strip.,2
"Had a lovely ladies lunch here. Was a crazy hot mid summer day, only available seating was outside. yikes! We were expecting 2 of our ladies with small children and this would not fly. After being notified that it would be a 30 minute wait, we were about to go elsewhere and the waiter told us to sit tight and they were cleaning off a table for us, that was just leaving. Very nice! n nPrices are about what you'd expect for DC Ranch so I can't complain. Food was fresh, light, good. Had a yummy salad. Everyone in my group loved their food and 2 are big complainers, so I guess that says a lot! n nI did not partake, but my companions had some sort of champagne mango treat that they raved over. Looked scrumptious too!",2
Had an amber ale and a Kobe beef burger. Both were delicious! This place has a great atmosphere and the staff were very friendly. This place will definitely be on my regulars list.,2
"The grand opening week was the first time we visited tacos with a minuscule amount of meat but things have much improved. I'll chalk it up to the loads of trendy skinny jean wearers trying to be as cool as we are. Now that it's filled with normal citizens, the food is much improved and they do have a nice draft beer assortment along with some wine for my wife. It's nice to dance between postino next door and here so you can mix it up depending on what you are craving. Very cool decor inside and a nice big bar.",2
"I had a great experience at this store. I found a absolutely darling Kate Spade purse almost brand new. Lots of bags clothes of all sizes. I thought the art furniture was a bit expensive, but the clothes were well priced. Also the style decor ambience of the store was one of the nicest I've seen in consignment stores no musty smell!",2
"The apartments are nice, but not worth how expensive they are. We never had any problems in the beginning moved in 11 2011 but since the new management has taken over things have gone downhill fast! nOnce you move in, the people in the office no longer have any time for you. EVERYTIME I have had to go down there for one reason or another, they only ever have one person working, and of course they are doing a new resident tour rental, which if you have ever been through that process, it takes a LONG time! When we first moved in there were 2 offices, 2 business centers, 2 pools, 2 fitness centers. Well now one office is closed, and last I checked so was the business center. They lock the business center up when the office closes, but yet the pool and fitness center are open until 10pm 11pm. The outside is crawling with cockroaches, and YUP! you guessed it! They are slowly making their way in! Due to the setteling in the building there is a gap in our back door that they are able to get in,. I called to put in a work order, and I set up an appt. for a friday. They never showed up, and never called. They showed up the following sunday unannounced. nThen there's the pet issues. Almost everyone in my building has dogs, and even though there are pet stations that provide doggie bags to pick up after your pet, there are people who don't. With the old management there used to be a grounds keeper who was out there every other day picking up what the lazy people left behind. With the new management, this has stopped. The ENTIRE ""pet area "" is COVERED IN MASSIVE PILES OF DOG SHIT!",1
"If you are here for the ride, this is the ride to get on in Vegas. Nowhere else in America can you ride a roller coaster around a fake New York. But was is really fun about this place is that the lines short in the morning! You only have 2 3 people max in front of you if you want the first car! n nOkay, so the ride itself thrilling. Yes. It's not really smooth, but the speed and loops around the hotel is definitely thrilling, and I'm not easily freaked on a coaster. The price is 14 a person now, but only 7 to go again. n nSad to say, this ""New York "" roller coaster is better than most of Coney Island's actual rides.",2
So I tried Island sushi again. Its been about month. Unfortunately it was bad. I don't know how anyone can give this place 5 stars. You must be very easy to please. The only fish that was fresh was the salmon. that's it. I just don't eat fish I buy fish for a living. I know what I'm talking about! The ebi shrimp they buy that frozen and serve it right out the package. The hamachi is a frozen loin. The tuna is frozen 2 saku block or loin CO treated. its the weekend at least order fresh for the weekend. I haven't tried there new place but I hope its better. they obviously turned there attention to the new place. Service was much better this time.,1
"I have been to Macayo's before and gave it a bad review which You can see in my profile but this time was the complete opposite. I was a little thrown off by the crazy shirts the staff wear but the place was packed and that is normally a great sign. We went with a few friends and we were seated relatively quick. n nNow to the reason that a star was lost. Our waitress came around the corner wearing her party animal shirt like everyone else which you would think would put you in an amazing mood, but instead she came around the corner like a communist leader demanding our order and being super impatient and not at all welcoming. Once we gave Mrs. Marx our order she disappeared and did not come back until the food was ready. n Pow, One star Gone n nThe Saving Grace here was the quality of the chicken Chimichanga that was brought to the table, first of all it was the size of a small baby and second it was probably one of the best chimichangas I have ever had. To me it says something when the food you serve can overpower the horrid service that your servers provide. n nI think we will go back from time to time I am just hoping that we dont get Cruella the waitress again.",2
"I have been taking my dogs, Bentley and Porsche here for a couple of years. From the time I enter the office until I leave, I am very pleased. They see Dr Hines most of the time as I ask for the appointments to be with her. I adore her and she really makes my dogs feel comfortable and safe. Any vet that will come into the exam room and sit on the floor with your dog is priceless in my book! She truly loves what she does. The staff is as good as they get. Oh, and then there is Jen, one of the vet techs. Bentley adores her! n nSue E.",2
"After reading the reviews, we were excited to experience sushi nirvana. Didn't quite get there. We started with the Deluxe Sashimi Platter. Around 125, the presentation was gorgeous. Chef's choice sashimi, it does include some of the harder to find specialities. We also had the Grilled Pork Belly which had great flavor, but the amount of fat was too much to handle. The crispy fried squid with chili and lime was flavorful. Overall the flavor, atmosphere and service was good. But that's just it. It was merely good. I can't complain about the taste or quality of the food, but I can't write home about it either. I've been known to pay a lot for a meal. This one was not worth it.",1
"They fixed my television fairly promptly. It took several days for them to return the TV to me. I had to keep calling. The day after I got the TV back it was broke again. It was five days before someone finally came to get it. A week after that I had to call them and ask what was happening. They had to order a part. Not a big deal, I don't mind waiting. After having no television for a month, I got a call this Tuesday saying that it was ready and someone would call me that afternoon about delivery. I called them back Wednesday. I was told someone would call me to arrange delivery. It is now Friday. I just called them again and was told someone would contact me today about delivery. n n nEach time I called they talked to me as if I was really inconveniencing them. They made little effort to keep me informed about the state of my TV and when I finally did call, I was barked at and the call was ended as quickly as they could end it. When I was given a specific pick up or delivery date for my TV I had to call them two days later to ask what was happening and was spoken to as if I was too stupid to know that they are running several days late. It must be my fault as I am not a mind reader. n n nI will NEVER hire them again. They were rude and thoughtless.",1
"Before my family and I moved to the Venetian as our standard Vegas hotel, we used to stay at the Rio because the rooms were big and cheap. Unfortunately, one night the night that made us change our minds about ever staying here ever again there was some drunk guy banging at our door demanding to be let in at 4AM. We had to call security on him because he was getting really scary. I guess this hotel just got really ghetto over time.",1
They no longer offer the ribeye. Which is disappointing. Ordered the blackened swordfish. Was way over cooked and not much taste. Ordered the garlic mash potatoes and again not much taste. Saut u00e9d spinach was good but does not make up for the failings. I asked the waiter about the ribeye and he said they changed the menu and the chef. Staff are nice. Need to find another diamond in the rough near Fremont street.,1
"This place is comically bizarre. The more drinks, the more comedic it all becomes. n nI've been a couple times with my coworkers, as they like to dance and drink after work. They get off late, so it's a decent casual venue. The crowd is middle aged. n nWe once ordered food. The only thing memorable was some fried chicken wings. I'll admit that I don't know much about Filipino food though, so whatever else made it to the table was lost. n nThe servers can seem a little lost as well. n nIt's one of those places where if you're buzzed, with good people, and everyone's dancing, then sure, it can be fun. I would never go here otherwise.",1
Now I am not a Cajun food expert but on a recommendation yesterday I stopped in to give it a shot. I ordered the shrimp and catfish por boy and the seafood gumbo asked them to throw a little sausage in for kicks . I tried the gumbo and the flavors were so rich and the seafood was cooked perfectly. Sent the por boy with husband today for his lunch after slowly reheating it. I will let you know what he thinks later. I will be back and strange as it sounds but it just might be today!,2
Don't waste your time I wasted mine! There was not one greeting and not one smile for the 30 minutes I was there from any of their employees. They would only give a store credit of 19 for all the things I brought in. brought them to a shelter where they would get more value. nHUGE mark ups! A lady bought a toddler bed from them 1 month ago for 99.00 she brought it back for a store credit of 46.00,1
It's kind of far but it's a great place. They always treat me well and the soft shell crab appetizers are delicious.,2
"This used to be my favorite but not anymore. I went on July 4th weekday dinner and I was disappointed in the lack of culinary selections. The dessert section is fabulous, atmosphere is great, staff is friendly and attentive. But the food and price aren't worth it anymore. Who knows maybe they were having a bad day but I'm not going to pay 50 to find out again.",1
"I haven't gone on my helicopter tour yet. booked it yesterday for this upcoming weekend. n nThis has to do with pricing and fees. n nWhen you go to order it states NO HIDDEN FEES and claims to be the cheapest etc. n nWell. after ""paying "" by way of credit card and waiting to hear confirmation as to whether we would be able to go. n nI get the confirmation. there is a 45 fee PER PERSON! I find this to be ridiculous. considering they state on their site as you are ordering that there are NO HIDDEN FEES. n nGrant it. I read the terms and conditions well and the only thing it seems to state is that it doesn't include taxes, port chargesetc. so I went back and researched on the details of the tour. it's not until you click the way more detailed list. and read carefully. there it is. it DOES state there is a 45 fee per person. n nHonestly. the FEE itself isn't what bothers me. it's the fact that they state NO HIDDEN FEES. yet make it less than obvious that there's this HEFTY fee. I had originally booked with another company who I had to cancel with as they didn't have enough room. their ""fee "" was only 10 per person. so I find this stating ""no hidden fees "" then slipping a 45 fee in there PER PERSON. to be a bit shady. n nHopefully the tour will be awesome. and I will let you all know. I just wanted to tell you to be prepared. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was.",1
"Yelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 Los Angeles 37 365 n nSeveral years ago, this use to be a Korean restaurant and now Roy's Raw Deal now occupies it. I was looking to try a different sushi restaurant instead of my usual, ""Ken's "" on Foothill. n nThe size is very intimate and the staff were very friendly. Roy always ask if you're allergic to any types of fish and that's very reassuring to know he cares about his customers. It can get busy on the weekends, so it's best to come as early as possible to get a good seat. Patrons are friendly and has the small town feel. n nSushi was very very fresh! n nService was excellent! n nAfter a long late night out of walking up and down the strip with my friend, we were hungry and didn't want to eat too far from the hotel. We wanted to something fast and not overpriced, so we chose the Terrace Pointe Cafe inside the Wynn Casino. n nAs with everything else in the Wynn, the Terrace Pointe Cafe was a high end 24 7 Cafe with views of the Wynn Pool Area and has outdoor seating. n nWe ordered n nDrinks n Orange Juice 6 n Sprite 4 n nEntrees n 12 oz. New York Steak 32 n fingerling potatoes, herb saut u00e9ed vegetables, red wine reduction n n Grilled Atlantic Salmon 23 n creamy corn, potato succotash, grilled asparagus, chili oil n nThe food and service 5 stars all the way but the prices hurt our wallets! n nNext time we'll just head to Denny's to save a few but if you're looking for the Wynn dining experience in the wee hours of the day, than Terrace Pointe Cafe is a great option for you.",2
"Tried Brio for the first time tonight. It was good. I very much enjoyed my dinner and the atmosphere. Came in around 6 15pm and we were seated right away. Our waitress was attentive and got our drinks out quickly. I tried the berry acai Italian soda which was just okay, I probably would not get it again. n nThe bread that was brought out before our entrees was very good. A combination of sourdough and a crispy baked focaccia type cracker bread. My sister and I both had Caesar salads before our meal and they were great. I ordered the pasta fra diavolo which had campanelle pasta with a spicy vodka cream sauce and chicken. I asked for it extra spicy and it was delicious. My sister had the ravioli di bello which was a portabella mushroom ravioli with a mushroom cream sauce, I tried it and it was also very tasty. n nService was great throughout the meal. Food was wonderful. Prices are moderate but worth it. Overall good. I will be back.",2
"My 4 year old attended the week long All Sport Camp. On Friday they take the kids to the park across the street and they left him there. THEY LEFT A 4 YEAR OLD KID, IN THE PARK, BY HIMSELF! Fortunately for us, a park employee found him and called the City Marshall's and he was returned safely. I supspected Meir sp? was lying to us about the whole incident, I am sure he was trying to cover his own ass. My suspicions were confirmed when I got a copy of the report from the Marshal's office. The Marshal said he would have pressed charges if he could but could not prove intent. Needless to say, any parent who loves their kid should avoid this place. You literally may not get your kid back if they do to your kid what they did to ours.",1

"Came here a few times before and wasn't that great BUT! Under new management and the food is on point! Slow minor changes are making this a diamond in the rough! New management whatever you are doing, keep doing it! Especially personally serving our sake bombs and opening our beers with chop sticks! My go to for sushi and sake!",2
"The one star is for the lobster rolls, which were quite good. For the rest? I walked away both unhappy and queasy. n nStart with the beer we visited PUB right after it opened and left without ordering because they were out of my first three beer picks. Tonight? Same story. Also could not make the first two mixed drinks my husband requested, but finally managed a vodka tonic. n nI ordered roast beef sliders. The roast beef was just ok, but the bread was dry, hard and cold. I also ordered a side of fries, which were served dead cold. Our server did go and get a new, hot order without argument, then brought me a bottle of ketchup which you have to ask for because only plebes want ketchup? absolutely crusted with old, hard ketchup. n nThe last straw was the drunk guy who decided to sit at our table for a chat. After I chased him off, the waiter came over and commented on it. After. Thanks. In a 1 4 full restaurant, I'd love a little more monitoring from staff. n nI'm sorry that I didn't take the time to ask for the manager and complain, but I really wanted to be on vacation. If you're also on vacation, choose NobHill MGM or Sensei Bellagio or even Todd English Olives Caesars for MUCH better food, and the same unexciting beer selection that you eventually discover is available at PUB.",1
"I happened to be driving past Anise Cafe and had to try out a new pho place I haven't checked out in the valley. I had high hopes when I walked in because the restaurant was very clean and I was greeted with a friendly smile. I wish I could give them more than 2 stars, but here's why I cannot n nPho nThe broth was bland and had almost no flavor to it. It wasn't terrible once I added lots of Sriracha and Hoison sauce to it. The meat and noodles were fresh, but when you don't have a good broth as a base, the rest doesn't do much. n nSpring rolls nI was excited to see mint listed on the menu, because many restaurants skimp on the mint. When I bit into the rolls, there wasn't even a hint of mint! Sad panda. n nBahn mi nBefore you judge me for being a fatty, I ordered the bahn mi to go for dinner. I ordered the charbroiled pork bahn mi. It was sub par in my opinion. The roll was not filled enough so it was mostly bread, and there was some sauce that was extremely salty. n nIf Yelp was based on service review, Anise would get 4 stars hands down. Unfortunately, we are in the food biz people, and the food here is not really worth for me to make a second trip.",1
"Oh Biancos. This isn't really a restaurant you can just say ""hey, lets go get a quick bite to eat "". This is a commitment of time. There are other pizza places in Phoenix, with perfectly good food. Biancos though, it's more of an experience. n nExpect to spend at least 4 hours here. 1 ish hours waiting to get on the list, and then 2ish hours waiting to get into the restaurant, then an hour of eating. Why would you want to do that?! Well, because it's fun. Make sure you go with a group of people you can have great conversations with. Go when the weather is fantastic, and make sure you want to have some fun. I always enjoy waiting in line with a glass of wine from Bar Bianco, which is next door. You can start your tab over there, and carry it over to the restaurant when you are seated. After you get on the list, the bar will also keep track of you and inform you when the restaurant is ready for you. n nBiancos is located in a quiet, great little section of PHX where there is actual grass and trees. So waiting will be in a park, where you can stand around and chat with friends and strangers. I always find myself, and my party chatting it up with the other people in line. we all know we are going to be there for a while, so might as well socialize. n nThe food is always amazing. I've gone several times and have tried most of the menu. My one bit of advice, always get fresh basil on your pizza. It's an extra cost, but makes a world of difference, no matter what pizza you get. The Margarita pizza is still my favorite of them all, it's perfection. n nJust go, expect to wait, and try to make the best of it. It'll be a great time with friends, with wine, pizza, fresh air, and that basil. ",2
"It started off, really badly as the server who began serving us was rude and could have really ruined the experience, but we were saved by a much nicer waiter in the end. That's why it get's a 4 and not a 5, also the decor is a bit boring. We did not get a salad as were anxiously waiting for our 14oz on the bone ribeye's, parmesan potato gratin, garlic brocolli rabe and something else I can remember we also had the the bernaise, peppercorn reducton and horseradish cream. All were perfectly done. The steak was a perfectly done and my husband says it's the best ribeye he's ever had and I'll have to agree, it was well marbled and really flavorful. The gratin was so good that my husband is still taking about it. I will have to try and make room for the truffle fried egg salad next time.",2
"Good work, roy. Thanks for the insight",2
"I think it's time for a reality check here the Palms sucks, and the Real World season everyone references when they're talking about the hotel aired about 5 years ago. n nWhy should you avoid the Palms? Here are some reasons n n1. The crowd Um, it's not where ""beautiful people "" congregate in Las Vegas. That distinction goes either to the Hard Rock or the Bellagio. In fact, the majority of the gambling dollars at the Palms come from Las Vegas locals, and I don't mean the kind of LV locals who dance at Spearmint Rhino. No, I'm talking about 70 year old retirees who have taken up second careers as slot jockeys. At any given point before midnight, half the people in the Palms have grandchildren. And the other half of the people aren't that great. n n2. The food I've seen some other people here point to the fact that the Palms has a food court as evidence of it's culinary accomplishments. Um, it's freakin' Las Vegas. You can do slightly better for a meal than McDonalds. All the high end restaurants in the Palms are overpriced and overhyped. N9ne? Yeah, it's okay, but Fix in the Bellagio has better food and better looking people. Guaradino's is a poor man's version in food quality, not prices of Diego in MGM Grand. And Nove? If you really want Italian, try Wynn they have some much better places there. n n3. The nightlife I'm sure Rain and Ghostbar were great when Trishelle and the rest of the Real World crew hung out there. Unfortunately, time rarely stands still, which goes double in clubland and triple in Vegas. In past five or so years, places like Tao, Pure and Jet have opened. So who goes to Rain and Ghostbar today? 21 year old guys who wear sleeveless t shirts. And lots of them. I know this because I once had a job reviewing nightclubs in Las Vegas, and I remember walking into Rain and thinking I'd accidentally ended up on the Jersey Shore. Um, not that there's anything wrong with that. Sadly, the new places in tower 2 Moon, The Playboy Club aren't special. n n4. The hotel Not to sound like a design snob, but the Palms just feels cheap compared to all the Strip places. The wooden flooring was an idea that seemed great on a designer's computer, but in real life just gets destroyed from all the foot traffic. The casino chips feel cheap compared to what's used elsewhere in the city. And the music is much better at the Hard Rock. n nIn short, skip the Palms and head for the Hard Rock or the Bellagio.",1
We had 6 girls and only stopped here for about an hour. The cover was too high and the music was terrible. It seemed like the kind of place where you go when you didn't dress nice enough to get into a club.,1

"I'll start with the good. n nThe food is very good, and the service is very tentative. n nNow the bad. n nThe prices are way WAY to expensive for the area. There is a plethora of other dining locations in the immediate area, at half the price. I mean really, 4 for a long neck!? 9 for a captain and coke!? Go to Applebee's across the street and get a beer for half the price. I know the owners have other locations in Peoria and Litchfield. Those areas I would understand the pricing, however this is a blue collar area and that is unacceptable. If everything were lowered by 1 or 2 this place would be packed. Unfortunate for the business that only two days after opening the place was a ghost town, and continues to be. Management needs a reality check.",1
"Not worth the wait! I made an appt to be sure to get my pedi, after I read the reviews about waiting a long time. Even with the appt, it's wasn't worth the visit. So I caution anyone. Do not wait, you won't be happy with the service! The lady cut my toe and kept telling me I was fine because there was no blood! There doesn't have to be blood to have pain! The rest of the pedi was crap and the polish job was horrible too! I now have a scab on cuticle line, almost the whole length of my nail bed! Horrible customer service!",1
 16 a person if you're willing to ride with other people or 64 for a private ride. It is an entertaining 13 minute ride but not really worth the price. Feel free to scratch this from your trip . you're really not missing out.,1
"The mark of a good italian place is its ability to serve the simpler items on the menu with panache and delicacy. Bell' Italia does that well. Service was attentive but not intrusive or pushy. We ordered the Ravioli and Spaghetti , and enjoyed them!",2
Love this place. it is so peaceful and beautiful. Came here as part of a large business function. We were taken on a quick tour of the trails. I've been here previously and taken in the butterfly garden totally worth the extra you pay . It has rotating events and art that is changing. I love coming here for the special events such as Chocolate and Chile fest. Getting a drink in one of the gardens and watching the sun set is one of the most relaxing and romantic ways to spend a quiet evening. A must see for locals and guests alike.,2
"A better place to eat at Las Vegas airport. 4 stars compared to what else is available. It can be a bit of a wait. However, the steak sandwiches are made to order. 8 for this was reasonable, for an airport. Add 4 for fries and a drink.",2
"I love me a good Sweet Tomatoes Souplantation and this location didn't disappoint. We were there on a busy Sunday afternoon and the place was packed, and I noticed the employees were doing a great job keeping things moving. from the cashiers to the hostess who led us to our table to the person cleaning up our section, everyone working there seemed to be hustling, which is nice to see. The food was the usual for a Souplantation, which is to say it's mostly what you expect fresh and no frills salad bar, chicken noodle soup, baked potatoes, soft serve, etc. , but there are also some flashes of brilliance on the menu the special couscous was excellent, as was the creamy mushroom soup . Bottom line, if you want to stick to your budget but still eat healthy ok, and maybe sneak in some cheesy bread and soft serve at the end of your meal! , this is a great place to go.",2
"We have been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience until today. We decided to take my mother in law who just came in from NY there. We were excited because we hadn't been there for awhile and had bragged about how great the food was. Well we got a totally different experience. We went inside and only 2 other tables were there, but it took the waitress over 10 minutes to give us our bread basket and drinks. When we ordered dinner, I had ordered the red snapper. I took one bite and it was NOT fresh. The taste was awful. We never send food back, but did because it was inedible. We let the waitress know and proceeded to look at the menu to order something different when the owner Marc came to our table with a raw red snapper. He told us that the fish was fresh and had just came in. I politely told him that our fish did not taste fresh, but very fishy. He walked away while I was in mid sentence. My problem wasn't so much about the food, but how we were treated. Rather than coming over to our table and apologizing and seeing if we were interested in something else, the owner was defensive and insinuated that we were lying about the food. We spent over 100.00 on lunch and I didn't even eat! For that reason I am giving the place a 1star and won't be back there again. It's a shame.",1
"I was really excited to try this place old school donut shop in my new hood? Score! n nWell, Meh indeed. The donuts were stale looking and picked over by the time I got there 11 30am so I opted for a croissant sandwich. They went back and made it as I stood there for about ten minutes. Which I wouldn't have minded if the sandwich was great, but it was just ok sloppy with lots of cheapo mustard and low level dairy meats. n nI don't plan on going back any time soon, but maybe I'll give it another try early in the morning and see if it's better.",1
"I have been to Myriade over a dozen times and typically order an Americano, sometimes a latt u00e9, periodically a snack. I cannot for the life of me get a hot coffee at this place and I like my coffee hot! Warm ish is the best I can hope for from Myriade, so this is a big bad in my books. nAlso, just fair warning Myriade coffee is perhaps an acquired taste slightly acidic or kinda manky in some way. I like many locally roasted, fair trade coffees from far and wide and this place disappoints me every time. It's also the most expensive bag of coffee I've ever purchased in my life, when I decided to try to make it at home. nI'd like to be able to love Myriade, since my studio is in the EV building of Concordia right next door, but. I. Just. Can't. nMaybe I'm not hipster enough.",1
"We are here for a stag party and the front desk started us on the wrong foot with an ill accommodating attitude, a condescending attitude and really zero customer service. Considering the area and the surrounding competition, this was a terrible surprise and next time we have to bring friends we will bring our business elsewhere. n nOne plus was the porter who was nice and accomidating unlike the front desk fellow .",1
Excellent choice if your looking for a little island flavor close to home. Mac salad oh yeah baby! Mixed plate was tasty and hit the spot. I will be back. Food Excellent flavor! Quality beef a little tough in some spots but not too bad Price comparable to other Hawaiian BBQ. Service friendly nThanks brah!,2
"Really nice food, from the bits of smoresbord and salad and scone we tried. The latte I had didn't particularly do it for me, kinda weak, didn't finish it. But I love the vibe here big wood tables, warm lighting, open spaces, lots of folks on laptops and no feeling of rush. I'd come back for a beer and snack with a computer for some soothing and well fuelled clickety clack.",2
"Went here with my friend for lunch today although the food was excellent the service was not. n nThe waitress did not look happy at all to be serving us although she had only one other table besides ours. n nWhen my friend asked for cream for her coffee she gave her attitude told her she was busy and would be with us as soon as she can. She also never came back to ask if we'd like refills on our drinks. n nThe eggs Benedict was really great as was the price for it that's what the two stars are for. n nOur check came right away, but took 20 minutes to be picked up by the waitress as she was socializing with other co workers. n nOverall, the food was great, but service is what makes me not want to recommend this place to my friends.",1
"Rating reflects our personal tastes. Atmosphere and experience was fine. n nThe atmosphere was nice. Lots of younger people here. The long tables was a cool idea. I went with a friend and we strike a small conversation with the people next to us. That was a cool experience. However, the long tables did allow our conversations to be overheard too. The food definitely looked like it was well made. I wouldn't say this place was American. It is more non traditional food. n nThere are several things I didn't like about this place. The menu is written on the wall so if you are sitting at an angle to the wall, you'll have to get it and look at it. But it is also available online so you can view it on your phone. They have a huge drink menu but their food menu is small. I wasn't really impress with their menu selection. n nI ordered an entree and my friend ordered three appetizers. The food here is definitely non traditional. I wouldn't categorize it as American like on Yelp. You don't get a raw medium steak with kimchi on porridge with sweet soy or raw salmon with weird bubbles all over it at a traditional American place. We like to try new places and new flavors but we just didn't feel this place. The food was hard to stomach for us. I finished 70 of my steak and kimchi then gave up on the rest. My friend is a poor nursing student. She couldn't afford to let it go to waste. Watching her forcing herself to stomach everything was like watching a horror show. n nThe place isn't bad. It just isn't for everyone. Come here for drinks. Come here to talk or hang out. Come here to eat? Maybe. I think it is just our personal tastes. If you're more traditional American Steak with mash potatoes and corn vs kimchi and porridge , you probably won't like this place.",1
Been here several times. Always good food. Every time I've been here it's been a long wait but that's because I usually go on Sundays and its very popular,2
"Where to start? I remember eating at this chain 20 years ago, when I was a child. Now I know why my parents stopped taking us there. n nI would wager none our food was made fresh, save perhaps for one of my family member's beef ribs which looked to be so overcooked, they passed ""dry "" sometime in the early afternoon. Everything tasted either canned or made from frozen. The chicken fried stake I ordered verged on inedible, and was clearly an overly deep fried frozen steak. The mashed potatoes were awful and pasty, to the point I would swear the simply scooped the inside of a baked potato and put it on my plate. If there was a trace of cream or butter in them, I couldn't detect it. The baked beans were clearly reheated out of a can, as were the green beans. For dessert, the apple pie was runnier than the soup that started the meal a beef barley soup that looked of refuse. n nTo top it off, the service was awful, with our waitress consistently forgetting requests and appearing about as often as my mother in law's urge to keep her nose in her own damn business. n nI can only imagine that this chain is still open because of the nostalgia. Stay away if you actually want to enjoy your meal. If all you want is a floor with sawdust, food that takes no more than a deep fryer and a microwave to prepare and inattentive service, this is your dream restaurant.",1
"Very nice place in Montreal. We stayed here for a bachelorette party. It was very convenient to everything, you can take the train to other cities or the metro to sights within the city. Not to mention the underground city is accessible without having to go out into the cold. There are several eateries to choose from and a mall to shop at.",2
"This club was pretty small and super crowded, I think table service should be in order if you don't want to stand. Being that we had plenty of girls, it was pretty easy to get in and was offered free drink tickets. Can't complain! n nThe music was good, but way too loud if you are in the middle of the dance floor. We left a little early and went to another club.",1
"Town Square sure got popular really fast! This place seemed like it was gong to be an amazing, chill place for locals, but its now resembling a club on the strip! It would be so much better if it wasn't so packed that you didn't need to get there an hour before opening or buy a bottle just to get some appetizers for happy hour I still have yet to be able to get a seat to try the appetizers . Disappointing. n nAnd 15 for a sub par martini?!? I guess if you want a place to hook up for a booty call this is your kind of place! Its too bad Vegas can't just have a truly chill local spot!",1
"Ain't. No. Way. I'm. Paying. 3. For. A. Single. Bottle. of. Vitamin.

"Finally checked this place out, as it's only a couple blocks from work. As a fan of delicious flavor, I'm sorry I didn't try sooner. n nIn a nutshell Tasty, tasty hot pockets empanadas. n nWhat I tried n1 turkey, bacon, cheese, and caramelized jalapeno pocket pie with a side of mango chutney great flavor, very nice bit of heat from the jalapenos, and the chutney was a great flavor counterbalance. n n1 southwestern pocket pie chipotle chicken with cheese, green chile, sweet corn, and black beans, with a side of cilantro avocado cream sauce not spicy, but more flavorful than the turkey bacon one. Very filling. n n1 side order of mexi fries fries with chili, lime, and parmesan flavor, covered in sweet corn relish decent flavor, but a little too sweet tart for my liking. n nThe pastry pockets themselves were hot, crispy, flaky, and chewy. I ordered too much food, because I wanted to try a few different flavors, and each pocket is quite large think a bit smaller than a large calzone. Luckily, I brought them back to work and was able to share with some coworkers. n nBottom line Great pastry, great fillings, great price 5 each . Will definitely come back, and definitely want to try their bacon wrapped dates next time. Gave it 4 5 because I think I'd have to try other items on the menu to see how they compare, and because the mexi fries were only average.",2
"Ate here on 5 18 13 with 5 others for a birthday. Gotta say, food was really good. My favorite was the flank steak. So juicy and cooked perfectly. Mushrooms were also tasty. Chicken was just ok.

Place was dingy inside , not very clean . I don't expect much from fast food places but when your starving and STILL can't bring yourself to eat the food that's a bad sign usually everything looks and taste better ! just gross all the way around.

"Interesting. I guess everyone has different experiences with this company. In my case I just needed to do a quick move as I had a deadline to move out and I was running out of time. I just needed all the big furniture moved using someone else's muscles and backbones. A friend suggested I rent a truck and spend a weekend doing it with his help but when I did the math, it seemed worth it to pay a little more and leave the heavy lifting to someone else. The chiropractor bills alone would probably cost more than the service these guys provide. These guys give you a range of about an hour for when they'll show up. Luckily for me they showed up near the end of that range because I was still staging all the furniture near the entrance to help accelerate the whole process. The bulk of the time was taken up by the actual drive across town. Everything else was very quick and smooth. The two folks that did my move were VERY professional and quite obviously very experienced as they suggested things I didn't even consider to make the move go smoothly. The best part about it was that it was so quick and smooth I was able to go to work just an hour later than usual rather than having to take the whole day off just to do this.",2

Despite the dilapidated d u00e9cor, smelly bathrooms and cheap booze, I can't call this place a dive bar it's just too big and has too many TVs to qualify. Speaking of the bathroom, I once overheard a conversation between two girls, one of which wanted to call some guy or another to ""hang out "" with after they left, the other of which was slurredly talking her out of it, at one point reminding her that the last time they hung out, he choked her.

I told him it had only been three days and that I was trying to be patient but that I needed my package and that after being treated poorly on the phone I decided to come get it myself and that this was an inconvenience. He said he had no idea where it was and to go check with my leasing office and see whether they had it. I went back home and checked with the leasing office nothing. At this point I was very annoyed because they offered no answers, no help, and I was being exceptionally inconvenienced. nWhen I arrived back at the post office they said that ""maybe "" they sent it back but they didn't know because their last notes said that they had it, but at that point it was obvious that they didn't. Their next piece of advice for me was to call the sender and see if they had it. I asked to speak to the manager, Joel told me he was the manager. I told him I didn't want a supervisor, that I wanted HIS manager. He said he wasn't in. I had to wrestle with Joel to get the manager's name Andy and when he would be in so I could talk to him about it. nI called the sender, they don't have my package. It's just missing. The last people to have it were the people at the post office because there was official documentation that said so. They still haven't taken responsibility.",1
"After a long night of partying, we were in desperate need of something warm or hot and comforting. What better cure for a hangover than Pho? We had a group of 12 and the people working there wanted to cram us into 2 TINY ass tables. Are you kidding me?! We kindly requested to add an additional 3rd table. they gave us this dirty look wow. n nAnyway, most of us got Pho, some of us got rice dishes and others some other noodle soup dish. The Pho was like 17?! What in the ! I anxiously waited for my Pho. and it came 30 minutes later. I do not know why it took them so long to slice up some beef, add the hot broth that should already be simmering in a huge pot, and some noodles. n nThe Pho wasn't even hot! It was lukewarm at best! The beef wasn't even cooking thru! The whole bowl had like 4 slices of beef. no meatballs, no tendons, no tripe. I didn't know you could mess up Pho, but this place did! n nSuggestion Don't come here. Bad and expensive food. Terrible service. Gah I'm still mad. I would've rather bet that money and lose it.",1
"I loved this place. I had the turkey, ham and Swiss croissant. Amazing. Like butter melting in my mouth but better. Everything was perfect and it was exactly what I wanted for breakfast and didn't know it! n nDesserts. Wow. the case was insane. I am going to invade that case like the Marines hit Iwo Jima. It was a orgasm to the eye and your senses are overwhelmed. Just looking at the cakes was as good as any birthday meal I am have had then to actually touch, feel, and eat it would be amazingly next level. However, because I am limiting my ability to be a total meatball, I just indulged in the macaroons. Wow, they are amazing. I decided to get one of each and the girl and I are slowly working our way thru the selections. They are all excellent and I will let you know when I invade that cake case! Coming soon!",2
"Went in to look for new couch and was impressed by friendly staff and good selection. I hate shopping and sleazy sales people, I didn't have that problem here. They let me look around without pressure, and answered all my questions. I ended up getting a sectional at a great price and it was ready when they said it would be. I would recommend this place to friends and family. Thanks for being honest and easy to deal with!",2
"So good! Every bite was heaven! Cool place, friendly staff. Nice spot! Never would've thought of this but drove by and had vaguely seen it on yelp but man I'm happy I stopped! I got Spicy Italian and it was great. I need to go here and try everything! Recommended indeed.",2

"I'm being generous here. I used to frequent XS when it first opened. It set the bar for Vegas clubs. This review is for table and bottle service. Unfortunately I didn't use my people for the reservation and my buddy and his crew used someone who didn't care. 3500 for a tiny booth next to the restrooms. It's no longer got any class to it. I've never been somewhere where so much money was being spent and I had my drink knocked so many times. Half the time it was from a bouncer charging through the crowd without care. I has to dry clean everything and my new JV boots were scuffed beyond repair. I'd advise dressing down for this place. We saw our waitress 4 times for the entire night and she was difficult, unaccommodating, and moody. The place was also packed to the point where a sea of people were swaying through the room and we were literally getting crushed against our booth. A shame as Encore is still a great hotel.",1
"Rice was undercooked. Seriously, they handle rice for a living and yet no one knew? And the salmon was old. Disappointing. I would've went to 808 Sushi but they don't open for lunch on Sundays.next time I'll stick to 808 Sushi.",1
Vladimir was prompt and arrived during the appointment window to repair my refrigerator. He made every effort to keep the cost down for me and his service call and overall price was much lower than the competition. He is a small business owner and keeps his overhead low to pass the savings on to his customers. I would definitely recommend him and Phoenix Appliance Services for any appliance repair needs.,2
"The price ended up being double what I was quoted from another table installer. Plus he lied about the cost of 30 30 felt costing him 425.00, I can get Simonis felt for half that price. I feel the company took advantage of my wife's good nature and trust in people when making the deal. Plus I had to call back the installers and have them redo the slate due to bad pocket alignment, the pockets on the rails was not even close to centered on the slate pockets. I also ordered a cover from them and was promised delivery but if I wouldn't have called I'm sure the cover would never have arrived. I ended up requesting a refund after two weeks of waiting. Due to the cost of installation, the rework and the failure to deliver a purchased product I wouldn't use this company ever again.",1
"We eat here often for many reasons. 1, it's right around the corner! 2, it's good! The ribs. Omg! So yummy! 3,4,5,6 it's right around the corner! Kids eat free on Tuesdays, make sure you call ahead to confirm, as it has changed in the past. n nIt's priced decent. You can get 4 ribs, 4 chicken tenders and fries for 10. That is enough to feed 2 kids or 2 adults if you are looking for something lite to eat. n nLots on the menu. The have drink specials on weekends and ladies nights. n nBy the amount of my check ins, you can tell I am a fan!",2
"Great Staff.Great service.within walking distance of my Apt.and the Candle deals are simply awesome. Starting back in November I have purchased at least 22 candles to this date Feb 18th 2013 . I mean the 3 wick candles usually go for 20 bucks apiece but they have been virtually giving away candles at Bath and Body Works since before the holidays of 2012. I mean 2 for 22.buy 2 get 2 free.4 for 30 with a coupon.8 bucks a piece with another coupon.30 40 off candles.I mean it has been crazy. So needless to say I look forward to buying many more this year when these glorious sales come around.until then Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!",2
"Today is the third time our dry cleaning has not arrived over night as it is promised and paid. When they went green there were signs and emails sent out how there would be no service interruption however it happened two weeks in a row. Today My laundry is not there, though it was supposed to be in yesterday as I dropped this off Wednesday at 7 45am. Someone clearly did not enter it and get it on the truck as the receipt shows 5 07 PM. I have a recycle bag that you drop off at the counter they charge your account and all is well in the world. However, They charged my account all before 10 00 am but didn't process my garments. nEver since they have changed over there staff we have had one incident after another. Their laundry service has ruined two of our shirts and it took them sending it back and arguing for two weeks before they finally decide to issue a claim. Then when the store owner gets involved the shirt miraculous comes back clean. We have had to return poorly pressed items multiple times. nIts extremely frustrating when no one takes ownership for the mistakes time and time again. We spend a lot of money here every week but today will be our last pickup. NO savings is worth the worry of are we even going to get our garments back.",1
"I have had way better. The chips are boring. The regular salsa tastes like it was out of a jar or possibly just not seasoned very well. The hot salsa tastes like spicy ketchup got mixed into some salsa. The refried beans are probably canned just judging by the way they curdle on the plate almost immediately and the rice is nothing to write home about. I had the green chili burro enchilada style with green sauce. I'm not sure what in that was seasoned weird possibly the sauce, but it may have been the green chili pork and it just did NOT taste like Mexican food. I didn't really care for it at all and left 2 3 of my burrito untouched. n nMy mom goes there regularly and gets a burrito filled with veggies covered in red sauce. The red sauce is much better than the green sauce. The veggies taste awesome especially the carrots and she really like it. My step dad gets a spinach enchilada which he really likes. n nI am not really keen on going here again. Everything but the veggies in my mom's burrito was so. bland.It did not taste like ""real "" Mexican food to me. Not even Amercanized Mexican food. I am sure I will go again because my mom likes it, but I will be sharing her veggie burrito and staying far away from the green chili pork.",1
"A couple Sunday morning brunch's here, and I am sold. Other than it's location, I can't say good enough things about it! The drinks are awesome, the food is fabulous, and the staff is on top of their game. I've had a few things on the menu, and I've been completely satisfied with each one of them. My girlfriends that I have gone with rave about the omelets, if you are into the ""egg "" thing. Really though, great place, sit on the patio if you can.",2
"I love this store, I shop there all the time. They have great stuff .BUT . The customer service sucks, there are a few employees that don't mind helping you but then there are some that hate being there. I've been waiting in line to pay along with a bunch of other people and the mrg Karen is walking around with her thumb up her a and won't open more registers. The wait time is terrible ! Jeez",1
"Convenient, but not the deal they claim when you get the oil change with the car wash. The tues wed thurs special is 29.99. They charge a lot for all the extras. n nNeed wifi, especially when u r sitting for 45 to 60 min n nFairly good car wash, but they stick it to u if u need synthetic oil. Normally 29. 99, they charge u 30.00 more.",1
"I love hole in the wall taco joints . usually. Not so here. I got the shredded chicken and the carnitas tacos. Soft corn tortillas, of course. No flavor on either I guess they really rely on their salsa bar. The carnitas bordered on inedible due to the very hard crust on the meat. Might try this again someday just to try to see how it got so many 5 star reviews, but this trip was barely worth 2.",1
"Oh my goodness! We were disgusted in this place. The plates smelled horrendous, the food was so awful we didn't even finish it and asked for the check immediately. We simply tried this place out of convenience and basically were robbed of our time and money. I'm quite sure one of my family members is sick as a result. n nThe ribs are all bone, the marination is not tasty and carries a terrible after taste. The salad was wilted and dry, how awful. We immediately felt bad as we attempted to try the French fries. How is this restaurant even in business ? So disappointing. Wash your dishes ! And learn to cook.",1
"Great place to get some ideas. nI purchased a couch, the delivery was easy and fast. nIf you like the south west flair, this store is a must .",2
"Hi My name is Thalha i am loyal starbucks customer, Last night at 830pm i went to the store 8951 south tryon street through the drive through and order iced venti soy chai latte, after i pulled out i tasted the drink and it had coffee in it, so they gave me the wrong drink. Thats fine, mistakes happen, so i went back through the drive through and waited 10 minutes in line and i was given the right drink after i returned the wrong one but not a word was said, not even an acknowledgement of we made a mistake and wasted your time, on top of that i had to ask for a straw and napkins. Thats just rude, the lady seemed to be bothered that i came back to get the right product i ordered. I am extremely disappointed at the lack of her customer service skills.",1
"I get the same thing every time I eat here, Carne Asada chimi, they make it just how I like it. They have churro's but I wish they had the fruit filled ones that would make a nice finish to my meal. I usually eat here for lunch from time to time they are quick and my food is always made correctly. My husband orders a variety of things and has always been happy with his choices from California burrito or the carne asada plate. The restaurant is always clean and so are the bathroom which for a lot of semi fast food places with a lot of traffic is not. There is a language barrier because most of the ladies that work in there know not a lot of English so the customer service is not bad but it's minimal communication with them. They are reasonably priced and huge portions. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a change from del taco and taco bell.",2
"I can't believe I never wrote a review for this place since I was so angry eating here. I will throw out the whole concept, and strange hospital gown you have to wear. n1. The service is horrible! Horrible! Horrible! The waitresses are mean, unhelpful, obviously hate their jobs other than the part where they get to spank people. The only actual smile the waitresses had n2. The prices are high! with extremely low quality food. n3. I got the single bypass with bacon and chili and the burger was as extremely overdone and the chili had the consistency of diarrhea with the taste of blended Walmart brand chili while the fries were soggier than I thought possible.They also only serve bottled drinks here. So no you can't have a glass of water. n nWithin 20 of eating here my entire group of 8 people had to run to the Golden Nugget to take emergency dumps! n nWhy would you go here! nDon't GO HERE! nSTOP! If you are in Fremont right now and looking at this review! Save your money and just take a cab to In N Out! n noh yeah Cash only here! wtf why would a newer sit down restaurant be Cash Only! Get a Square or Paypal reader! Yes complaining about cash only is fair because it shows what a greasy cheap under the table establishment this is. oh bookkeeping and 3 is too expensive for this obvious cheaply ran place That is an inconvenience as someone that messaged me complained about this review. Cash only businesses don't get called out as a negative if the meal is less than 10 or an exceptional mom and pop shop this place is clearly neither. Very easily one of the top 5 worst businesses I have ever reviewed.",1
Being Vietnamese I loving Banh Mi I was shockingly disappointed in this place. Everything I tried tasted off and not fresh. I was only able to finish 1 3 of the Combo banh Mi before I gave up. The banh Cuon was even worst. The meat inside the rice noodle wrap fell apart which is when I notice rice paper wrap could not be fresh. It was like they bought factory prepared wrap and assembled it there. The only semi decent item I tried was the Bi Cuon chay pork spring roll . Unfortunately it's not enough for me to return.,1
"Rented a car for 5days and end up with a hyundai accent car super lame the car smelt like smoke and the plug for the iPod wasn't working. It sucked too cause the car was manually rolled up windows and lock the door your self. Since I was 21 years old I was charge 75 more for the underage fee plus I got the insurance which was 20 a day so there goes 100 added to my total which came out to be 500 not worth it cause the car was shitty . I guess renting a car under 25 years old is ridiculously expensive. Not so bad if you have five friends splitting the bill but it was just me and one person. Next time i visit vegas I'll prolly just be catching the cab every where. One star for good service and the other star I guess for being fair, can't blame the price being so high cause I am underage.",1
"I'd been eagerly awaiting for Popeye's to make a return to the area for years! Anytime we would eat at Bojangles or KF Grease.heck, even that greasepit Church's.I would always tell my young son about the greatness of Popeye's and couldn't wait for the day to try it with him. n nThey finally opened one in my most unfavorite mall and we made the trek to give 'em a try and to make a return to Dave Busters as a last hurrah before school started back for my son on Monday. n nWell, it's not the Popeye's I remember it to be. My first wave of disappointment was to see that they no longer carry their Cajun onion rings. 2nd was having to pay a buck thirty extra for white meat chicken! We got 2 chicken meals with a side of Cajun fries 2 drinks all for 22! Friggin' mall prices! n nChicken portions were on the small side and the biscuit was a little larger circumference of a half dollar coin. The crispy goodness was the same and the meat had the right amount of heat, but they were a tad over cooked. Fries were just ""okay "". Sweet tea is where they truly shined. My god. Best fast food tea I've had in a long time.made with cane sugar! I had so many refills, my teeth were floating! n nSo my rating falls around 2 1 2 stars. I will try them again when I grudgingly make a return trip to this mall that I cannot stand since its probably the only decent restaurant in their dismal food court. I think I'd rather make a trip across the street to the excellent Fosters now that I think about it. n nYour pal, nWalter",1
"It was the end of our weekend anniversary celebration at the Aria, and my husband and I decided we would celebrate with a special night out at Bar Masa. We were looking forward to elegantly prepared Japanese dishes and sushi prepared with fresh buttery fish and fresh chilled shellfish. We knew it would be pricey but we were willing to splurge on a special evening out. n nAll we can say is, ""What a disappointment. "" Not only was the quality of the fish and shellfish mediocre, but the rice was hard and overly seasoned. The sashimi wasn't served at the right temperature. The eggplant was dry and hard and was not very flavorful. My husband's only comment was that his 80 year old Japanese aunt could cook better than that. n nNot only did we find the food quality to be disappointing, the service was mediocre as well. For a high end restaurant and the price, our advice would be to select a different Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas for a better dining experience.",1
"One star is being considerate. nWent 5pm on a Saturday sat the bar. Bartender was restocking the bar the other end never greeted us. While we waited patiently for her to come over, 4 people walked in wanting drinks to go she served them before even greeting us. I had to stop the Manager to take our drink order food order after waiting about 10 minutes. nOnly about 4 tables were occupied in the restaurant, yet it took about 40 minutes to get burgers for the 3 of us. The food was decent but customer service was horrible.",1

I urge you to visit Roy's and I assure you, it will be a new destination.",2
"I'm a huge fan of the new City Center. Its so beautiful. This club is right next to Eva Longoria's Beso restaurant and in the Crystals Hotel in the new City Center. n nI actually went to this club last Saturday by default because Haze was trying to charge 40 bucks for guys and 20 for girls. Granted it was close to midnight on a Saturday but still. so we decided to try our luck somewhere else. n nIn very close walking distance is TA DA EVE! n nThis club is pretty small I would compare it to Lavo feel at Palazzo. Tables everywhere. I only saw one main bar under this huge pretty chandelier. What I really enjoyed were the huge projector displays showing music videos of the song they played! n nThe music was top 40's, hip hop, trendy etc. They played Red Red Wine! haha. Love it. n nHad a good time and would def go back. There was no line and it was free. Gave me a chance to spend my money on the of course expensive Vegas drinks but thats typical! Diverse crowd also.",2
"I checked this restaurant out on Yelp before visiting and saw that it was on the pricey side for breakfast but the menu sounded good so we went. The raspberry granola pancakes with bacon were very good and a large portion also, but I was disappointed to see that the prices were even higher than what showed on this website 11.99 instead of 9.99 . My husband had an omelet with spinach, bacon, tomato and cheese. It came with a few potatoes and one slice of toast. It wasn't much above average and also pricey. So, be prepared.",1

"I've been here 4 times before they had full service now with the friendly service staff. Each time we've been there, food has always been the best.

"We had shrimp tempura and the salmon teriyaki. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either and worst of all . way over priced. We have never been to a Japanese restaurant that didn't give you miso soup when you ordered a dinner entree. They came with salads, but the dressing wasn't very appealing and the lettuce wasn't as crisp as it should have been. The small piece of salmon arrived topped with 2 really tiny asparagus spears and a bowl of rice. The tempura was okay, but the sauce served with it was rather bland. We just expected more besides the miso soup .some maki, more vegetables or pickles.something. Maybe their sushi is a better value and that's why they're getting 4 5 stars.",1
"Not worth the wait. The regular line takes about 5 hours after asking the people who were near the front of the line. There is an a express line which took 1 hour but at a cost of an additional 20 per person. So the total per person comes out to 77 not including tax. I took the express line to save time but after being seated there are more lines just to get food ridiculous. n nMost of the food was just okay and are mostly available at other buffets like the Rio, ie snow crab legs, salmon, shrimp, sushi, etc. However, they did have a tomahawk ribeye steak that was excellent. Obviously they won't give you the whole steak.",1
"Located inside the Queen Creek Olive Mill in their own cute merchant space. They know their coffee! How many times do I have to tell a barista what is in a dirty chai, or triple check that they used soy, ugh! Not these guys.they get it right every time! n nThey also sell burlap sacks for all you DIY ers.",2
Paper thin crust if you like that then this is the place for you. n nI paid 16 for a 18 inch pie that was average.,1
"I found this firm as it was very close to my new home. I will stay with this firm because it has top notch, personal and professional, service and value. They were excellent!

"Met a friend here for post work, pre Christmas drinks and once again was happy with out choice. Table service was fast, even though the bar was pretty full for a Wednesday night. n nStella on tap, and we both ordered the Sligo Sliders Fillet Mignon tips, horsy sauce and au jus. As usual, they came out perfect, just the right amount of crispy, battered onions on top, the buns toasted, and nice and hot. A shared basket of their awesome, thick fries really, more like wedges completed the order and filled us up.",2
Did you say 5 don Julio shots? n 4 margaritas? You can bet your that anytime you come here you will hear this. To me that is music to my ears! Why? Oh because I LOVE tequila. Just no gold tequila unless it's in a margarita that's okay. n nNow if you are already feeling it from prior drinks elsewhere and are looking to eat this is a place to come when you have friends with you to sit upstairs and take it easy and knock some more drinks back. Because during the time you wait depending on your waitress you might have to wait a bit you might not. Now when my friend and I went on Friday we weren't concerned really on how long it took between things until we wanted to pay for our tab. Apparently the waitress was down stairs serving as well. We easily could have ditched our tab in which my friend was saying we should do but since it was Friday the 13th I felt like we would get bad juju for something like that. So we had to search high and low for this waitress of ours and told another waitress we needed to leave right now and had to get our waitress then she came running. When you are working multiple tables on multiple levels I don't expect prompt service on a Friday night just a good place to come for drinks really because the Mac and cheese burrito is okay at best. Nothing spectacular just better drunk food then filibertos nonsense!,2
"I ate at Crispy Crepe with my husband on a Friday evening and truly enjoyed the experience. Although our food took a little time getting to us it was worth the wait. We ordered the Pecorino chicken and Bruschetta crepes and split them between ourselves. We both had the little hummus with cilantro side. We really enjoyed our food! I can truly say it was better than I expected. This was my first time eating at a crepe place.my husband's second. He said he enjoyed his crepes at Crispy Crepe better than another place he'd tried. I also thought the meal was filling. Although my mouth was salivating at the dessert crepe that was being served at the table beside us, I was too full to order dessert. I am so glad we took a chance on a Groupon deal for this or we probably wouldn't have known it existed. The atmosphere was relaxing and consequently we were very comfortable and enjoyed the evening at Crispy Crepe immensely. We would definitely go back.",2
Decent food. Server neglected us when we didn't order alcohol. No free chips and salsa. Good portions. Liked the chicken enchiladas. Overpriced but could be worse for a strip restraunt. Kinda hidden and small. Made a nice lunch. Lots of light and color in the decor.,1
"I LOVE Asian food. LOVE LOVE LOVE it. Even if it is Americanized seeing as how I live in America and all I still can't help but embrace every greasy morsel of food every time I eat at an Asian restaurant. n nEven moreso, I love Thai food. Panna Thai just happens to be another reason I love Thai food. My boyfriend and I had a restaurant.com coupon because I joined The Dinner of the Month Club when they were having a crazy deal a while ago. I get a 25 certificate once a month, plus one complimentary 50 gift certificate for the year, and it all costed only 24 dollars for the year! Crazy, right?! Anyway, we decided to use our first one for Panna Thai, because I was craving Thai food and honestly, who isn't?! n nThe restaurant is located kind of in the middle of no where. on Fort Apache and Russell. It was 8 pm at night on a Saturday. and there were like two other tables in there when we walked in. A slow night, it seemed. Nevertheless, I still wanted some Thai food, and with the decent reviews on Yelp, I decided I wanted to splurge. n nI ordered a Thai iced tea to start out with. I have never had a Thai iced tea before, so I am not sure how they are supposed to taste, but it was DE LICIOUS! I would go back and get those anyday. n nFor our appetizer, we had the ever so traditional crab rangoons. My boyfriend agrees, as well these crab rangoons were some of the best we have ever had! The crab to cream cheese ratio was perfect. Because the kitchen was not busy at all, our entrees came soon after. We ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice and the Pepper steak to share between the two of us. Let me tell you, these two dishes filled us UP! We were so full, and it was all delicious. I am a sucker for fried rice and the addition of pineapple was just the perfect amount of sweetness. n nWhile dinner was wonderful and the crab rangoons WOWED us, dessert was my favorite. And honestly, what kind of girl doesn't love dessert?! Because we were full, we decided to order just one dessert. We ordered the fried bananas with coconut ice cream. A MAZING! I wanted to throw it up and eat it again, it was so good. n nOverall, it was a great experience. I'd definitely go again, especially to try more of the menu. It's pretty big, and this place definitely deserves a few visits in order to get the full experience of the menu! And I'd go back in a heartbeat for those fried bananas. JIZZ IN MY PANTS!",2
"HORRIBLE SEATING! They pack you in like cattle NOT ENJOYABLE. Show is good, seating is just the worst.",1
"So good. The burgers are good, the adult milkshakes are good, the service is great. Good service is so hard to find these days, so it's much appreciated! Went to one of the many other burger places while in Vegas that didn't even come close. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been here before!",2
"Im not judging this on the coffee at all. this 2 stars goes to how slow this place is. n nI was once in the drive thru for 20min. when we pulled up, they gave us the coffee for free. Ever since it seems I average 10min per visit. That's hella long. n nTIP If you are going in the mornings before work. DO NOT use the drive thru. go inside, it's much faster.",1
"Absolute majestic hidden gem located in the MGM Underground. n nA pizza with all the toppings you want for only 12 in Vegas cant pass it up. They're quick, delicious and the employees are friendly! n nFor dessert, we ordered a nutella and peanut butter pizza and it was DELICIOUS. it came out nice and warm and the manager sprinkled some cinnamon on top. Its best to be eat right away as it tastes superb extra hot. But don't get me wrong, it's still good after its cooled down. n nPlease open one up in the Bay Area!",2
"Very disappointed about our experience after hearing reading such rave reviews. n nService was terrible. We were a big group but had an early dinner and the restaurant was close to empty. Took forever to get to us for drink orders, then didn't check back throughout the meal to see if we wanted more. Don't restaurants make a mint on alcohol sales? shrug n nThe waiter was non existent throughout the meal, we had to chase him down to get the check. Three of the steaks were dried out pieces of leather. One person in our party said it was the worst stake she ever had. At 40 a steak, it damn well be the best. n nWe had a side of broccoli it was practically raw. n nOverall this was a very disappointing meal certainly not worth the price. There are many other steak houses in Vegas that do it much better.",1
"Warning Yelpers This place no longer honors Restaurant.com coupons. There are signs all over the front doors stating this, which is .weird. I didn't have a coupon but several reviewers here mentioned them. n nI ate here and died of boredom. nWe ordered the smaller plate of Aguachiles 17! and Enchiladas in Mole sauce 7 for lunch n nThe wait was very long because I ordered from the dinner menu at lunch time, but that's not a problem. There were 3 complimentary bowls of salsa standard, tomatillo and pico de gallo. I liked the pico de gallo, they all tasted ok but they were so bland that we finished all 3 bowls without even noticing it. n nI ordered the Aguachiles because the dish looked exactly like ceviche of filet shrimp that Fiesta Jalisco used to serve at this same location. But Jalisco's was hot and delish while this was nothing of the sort. It didn't even have avocado and red peppers like the picture on their menu. All we could taste was first sharp red onions, then lime juice and finally ground jalapenos, bitter and sharp, 17 for a small portion? n1 star n nNext the enchilada, the mole sauce was not bad, not great but the chicken was dry because Gringos insist on white meat only and when I was offered a bit more all I could reply was ""no thanks, I'm bored with this "" n n I'm giving them 2 stars instead of only 1 because the waitress cared and tried her best, but next time I'll drive down to La Unica instead",1
"I really enjoyed my visit at Best Foot Spa. We made a reservation but showed up half an hour early and they immediately seated us with no hesitation. We were offered tasty hot tea as the massage began. Large tubs of water were brought out. It's basically a wooden tub lined with a plastic bag filled with warm water. You put your feet in and they wrap the bag up around them and put a towel over to keep everything nice and warm while you are relaxing. The recliners were tilted back for us and more pillows were brought to ensure we were comfortable which was very nice. I chose the 90 minute massage with 30 minutes on the feet which was 50. In my opinion it was definitely worth it. It was hard for me to relax at first because it was a new experience but soon I was able to let go and enjoy it. The massage started with my face and sinus area, followed by my scalp. I loved the scalp part. The one unusual thing was that the lady massaging me answered the shop phone while she was working. And then she got up and a man took her place for the rest of the massage. That was okay but a little strange. Anyway, he massaged my neck and shoulders for a long time, followed by my arms. Then he switched and did the foot portion during which he also worked on my calves. Then he had me flip over so he could work on my back and boy did he ever! It was painful at times but felt really good after. He really got in there and worked the knots out. My back felt fantastic afterwords. n nThe place was clean and the staff was very pleasant. I would definitely go back again.",2
"The Las Vegas Welcome Sign is one of the most iconic spots in Las Vegas and the United States. It greets everyone who drives North on the ""Strip "" from Sunset. The sign is close to the airport and people like to pickup their rental car a few blocks away and drive to the sign to get a few vacation starting pics. n nThe Las Vegas Welcome Sign now has a few parking spots that are much safer than driving up on the curb with your flashers on while other cars go speeding by. Several of the parking spots accommodate buses or very large limos. The walk up area has also been slightly upgraded and appears to be well maintained. n nWhen I visit, as a local, I enjoy seeing people taking photos of their experience, in this great city. The pictures will undoubtedly get uploaded into social networking sites, where potentially hundreds of other people will learn about their adventures and want to visit as well.",2

"I've always loved this bar and have gone since it opened. Love Paul, the best bartender in the world. Once he waits on you, you pretty much never have to tell him your order again. Great apps! But I must admit I haven't gone lately due to having to pay to park after 5pm. Think its ridiculous. Great people watching !",2
I had a totally opposite experience than the reviewer below curious g . I thought the owners were trustworthy and genuine. Didn't even charge for simple watch repair that took two seconds. They always give honest advice and actually care about the customer. Edward Marsha have been in business for a long time. Family owned operated and the owners are always there. Friendly neighborhood place. A fun selection of unique jewelry too. I would send people there again and again.,2
"My husband and I are night owls and wanted a place to play on our computers and sip lattes! This place is fantastic, they have nice big comfy chairs to sit in, and almond milk! great atmosphere and the baristas are friendly and make delicious drinks.",2
Only went once . it made me question whether I was getting past it as it was too loud and full of students. So I left after one drink and went to the John Leslie.,1
"The Roundtable Buffet was an excellent deal at 25 all day but the quality was mediocre at best. We had a member of our party with a food allergy and we specifically emailed them weeks in advance to find out how their food was prepared and to say they were less than honest would be an understatement. Of course, we didn't find this out until we were into the dinner service and the member of our party happened to notice a piece of shellfish which she is severely allergic to in a salad that she was told should be safe. n n nRegardless of the allergy issues, If you've ever been to Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral, you'll have an expectation of the quality of food you'll be receiving. It's not mind blowing, but it's not terrible either. The quality is sufficient and they seem to do a decent job at rotating things as they become old or empty. n nIn terms of the management of volume, they were completely unprepared to deal with the amount of people at the dinner service. They had 4 buffet bars total, but only had one open and the line was out the door to even get in, then again long to get any food on the buffet, and terribly long if you wanted to get anything at the ""cutting station "". n nThe floors in the little rooms where you self serve drinks were sticky and you had to double check your cups as one batch we noticed didn't appear to be completely clean. n nOverall, if you're willing to save a few bucks and don't have any food allergies, the Roundtable may be for you. The 25 day deal can't be beat, just be sure you're diligent while visiting this aging buffet.",1
"Ate here the other weekend with family. The atmosphere was nice. Felt like oldtime Vegas and our server was good. So, one star for that. nAnd one star for the Apple martini. the best part of my meal! nI ordered the veal parmesan and it was dry and a dinner salad that was swimming in dressing. My bf order the ravioli and it was fried what the heck? . For the cost of this meal, I would rather have gone to the roulette wheel and bet all on green 0.",1
"Kabuki Tempemarket Place used to be my favorite sushi restaurant until recently when I had what can be described as one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. We placed our order about 3 5 minutes prior to the start of happy hour after waiting about 30 minutes to be seated . When it was time to pay, our check did not reflect the happy hour prices. Our waitress was new and she admitted that she forgot to wait to put in the order after happy hour had started. She obviously couldn't do anything about it so I asked to talk to her manager. This is when I became beyond disillusioned with this restaurant. The manager Ashley was beyond rude. She actually said it was OUR fault for sitting before happy hour had started. She was very condescending. I really could not believe she was the manager. I am very disappointed. Sadly, I will not be going back.",1
"I love Light! We arrived at 10 30 on a Saturday with both girls and guys in our group for the guest list. You need to have a 1 1 ratio for the guys to get comp'd. Any extra guys have to pay. I recommend that guys buy their tickets ahead of time online. The night we went, it cost 40 online and we were told that the ""extra "" guys could just go in the GL line and pay 40 at the door. It turned out to be 55. So buy ahead! The rest of our group was comp'd and all of us received wristbands for an open vodka bar until midnight. BEST DEAL EVER! Since we had arrived so early as to have a shorter wait, we had plenty of time to take advantage of the open bar. Plus, it was the main bar that was free, not some small bar in the corner. So it didn't take long to get a drink. n nThe atmosphere and decor is what made me fall in love with Light. The LED screens are huge and at times they have dancers behind them. The other lights are crazy, shooting various colored beams all over the dance floor. The Cirque Du Soleil dancers and performers kept me in awe. There were aerialists, mermaids ""swimming "" midair, and guys suspended by harnesses running across and up and down the LED screens. Each costume was so thought out and they had various themes throughout the night such as enchanted forest and underwater. n nLadies Don't be afraid to wear heels. There isn't much walking required through the casino or to get inside the club. No or minimal stairs no secret hallways. n nThe club is rectangular shaped and is set up in tiers. You enter on the highest tier, which has the main bar and a small ledge facing the dance floor. I set my drink on the ledge and stayed at that spot all night. I wasn't in the mood to go on the dance floor because it seemed really crowded. But not as bad as Hakkasan. There are 2 or 3 other tiers of tables leading down to the main dance floor. The tables seemed spacious. One guy at a table started causing problems with my friend and bouncer escorted him out immediately. n nThe lights and the Cirque Du Soleil theme makes Light one of my new favorite clubs. I can't wait to come back!",2
"My room had a leak on the AC and the puddle got progressively bigger each day which gave the room a funny odor. There was a piece of glass in bathroom so my foot was bleeding, not a great way to start the vacation. Bathroom wasn't throughly cleaned upon arrival. The shower handle was loose, like it would fall off. Plus it hit me in all the wrong place all, water stream and pressure needs some work on. I saw 2 prostitutes enter my elevator with two John, gross, very unclassy. The scene was overall trashy. I saw a drunk girl get carried away in a wheelchair, she was that drunk. The internet fee was ridiculous. Pricy resort but nothing special, don't let the looks fool you. The Wicked Spoon had crappy unappetizing food. I'll stay at other places next time.",1

"Planet Hollywood no more! bye bye. After coming here for the past several years we no longer will spend our holiday vacation here any more. n nI stayed here the end of December and encountered a slew of problems! some much more major than others. Stayed 3 days and had 2 rooms booked. Upon arrival and check in, one of the rooms were not cleaned. Called front desk which told us to talk to housekeeping. Housekeeping said that they would not clean the room because it was past a certain time.the room did not get cleaned till 5 hours later.Had to call several times and get the run around! n nAnother issue MAJOR issue occurred was that there was not any hot water! Halfway through my shower it went from hot to cold! luckily we had another room to use and there was hot water. This happened 2 of the 3 days there. n nSome smaller issues. Busted toilet! Ended up having a toilet that kept running flushing. We told housekeeping and nothing was done. 3 days running water. The hotel asks patrons to conserve energy and water and doesn't do anything to wasting water. The tv in one of the other rooms had poor quality and the picture was over extended. you could not tell what channel you were on because it was not properly displayed. also the volume on the tv was just loud! one room was fine. n nExplained all the issues to the front desk when checking out and only the resort fees were comped.i even mentioned that due to these problems that i would not be coming back. the guy was ok letting me go. n nskip the gym. limited hours and super small. not what i was expecting at all",1
"The service here can be hit or miss, but more often than not, I don't have problems. Usually, when my friend and I stop by, we're waited on by the same server, and our food comes up relatively quickly. It's always fresh, too. Unfortunately, when they get busy, it creates problems because they don't have a stock of anything prepared, which in turn creates delays. Their cashiers have a habit of walking away from the counter in the evening, leaving customers waiting for however long it takes them to notice someone is standing there. While I understand that they have to clean up the restaurant for closing, there should always be someone to watch the counter. n nAs a side note, their drive thru speaker went down about a month ago and still hasn't been repaired. It creates delays at the drive thru window for placing orders, especially later in the evening due to above mentioned cashier habits.",1
"Great setting. walked into sitting area since no hostess, who soon materialized and made us feel like we did something wrong for walking in but we went to bar and blew her off. Bartender was good, but when the rest of party showed and we went into sitting area, waiter pulled a fast one. Bad margarita was delivered, so it was sent back. Brought back a different one to see if liked. So so but drank anyway. When final bill came, so so margarita was actually 3 more than normal marg, but he never told us. When brought to his attention, he was indifferent. His tip was less than normal for this so he lost out, but management needs to talk to waiters so customers aren't screwed. Not a lot of money but bad for business. Be careful when you order and check your bill.",1
"Excellent, food and service! I recommend taco Wednesdays. Their busy but fast and the chicken tacos are perfect.",2
"I've been a fan of Four Peaks for years. They have always provided that neighborhood feel bar that is all to often lost these days. The Hop Knot is my tap special. I couldn't believe my eyes when I stopped in for a brew and a bite and noticed a change in their menu. They always run a daily special but I don't remember them ever changing the menu. I ventured outside my comfort zone and went for ""The New Yorker "". Pastrami is right up my alley. I guess the reason they haven't changed the menu in years is because they spent some time perfecting some items. This pastrami sandwich was better than the one I had at the Carnegie Deli. Marble Rye, Pastrami,cole slaw and mustard. Get me another beer please! Looking forward to coming back to try the other additions on the menu.",2
"LIke the other post said "" you gotta pay to play "", unless you buy a bottle or you get hooked up on some other accord, you will be payin some dough.

We had two guys in our group so we wouldve been forking out some cash. We had just partied at Caramel, after driving 5 hours to get to Vegas.maybe we wouldve. But after seeing his smirk and stuck up attitude when we didnt give him enough money, we turned our happy asses around.F Drais!",1
"I only been to this place three times, and the third time I been here I ordered a vegetable teriyaki bowl as I started to eat my meal I realized there was a bug on my broccoli ill post a pic too and got sick to my stomach.

"Cane's is a good place to get lunch with friends and hang out. I almost always order a Caniac 6 pcs of chicken, toast, fries, slaw, and sauce I replace the slaw with toast because the fries are plenty for me and I don't like their slaw. After eating the whole box of food, I'm pretty stuffed. It's a bit pricey for chicken fingers, but I think it's worth it. n nThis location is usually pretty packed around lunch time, so be warned. nThere's something about their caniac sauce and toast that makes me come back for more.",2
The steak was okay. A little gritty and not as tender as I'd hope. The Flemings Potatos were terrible! They wern't cooked all the way. Our drinks sat empty quite often. They forgot the butter for our king crab legs and we had to remind them a few times to bring it. For dinner at 150 nI would expect better. We wished that we had gone elsewhere.,1
"I checked out a free preview with my 11 month old this weekend. He really enjoyed himself so did we. The teacher Ms Jamie was awesome, couldn't believe she remembered every kids name in the class, including us newbies! Britt at the front desk was great at handling such a busy crowd of people looking to sigh up. We ended up booking our sons 1st birthday party here after checking out competitors like My Gym Childs Play. This place is the best spot for little ones under 4. All the birthday package prices are competitve starting at 225 for members for 20 kids. We added pizza drinks for 125. WIth this package you have the place to yourself for 2 hours, they set up decorate, clean up, serve your cake, etc. The paper goods are also provided by them.",2
"Love it here! nI've stayed here before and I'll always choose to stay here when I want to be away from the strip. nI highly recommend booking your actual reservation with the hotel and not through a third party website because your room preferences will not be guaranteed and your reservation may not even show up. I say this because it has happened to me. Long story short, I got my reservation fixed and Platinum hooked it up! nGreat staff from the front desk, the hotel manager Sky, the bell boys, and Jeff the valet guy. They greet you every time you enter the hotel and bid you a genuine farewell when you leave. nLOVE the full kitchen, the balcony, large bathroom with jacuzzi hot tub, and very spacious noh and heads up, no self parking. Only valet.",2
I had the worst experience at our stay. We have been staying very summer for the past 10 years. Our kids grew up with our stay at the Marriott a family tradition This year was a disaster. Our room was supposedly an upgrade yet there was no separate glass shower as we had requested. The service at the pool was horrible. The waiter came by twice without our drinks. We waited 45 min Our room has a out dated tv that barely changes Chanel's. It's so frustrating. When u open the bathroom door it hits the closet and closes on the person trying to get through. The pool area is FILTHY with empty cups beer cans and trash. It smells like urine and vomit when you walk on the concrete. The bathroom mirror looks like it hasn't been cleaned in months. The pool closes to early. There is nothing for adults to do after 10 pm it's like a senior citizen center closing down after 9 at night. Other resorts allow their guests to enjoy the facilities until midnight even all night at Hyatt at gainey ranch. I can honestly say I will never consider a stay at this resort again. Poor service. Dirty property and outdated rooms. Very disappointed.,1
"After reading about this place from Michelle T. and Carol L.'s reviews, I've decided to bookmarked this place to try when I'm back in Vegas. I remember driving by this restaurant on Las Vegas Blvd. and wondered if it was any good. I made a reservation through open table for 10 30am. and asked for a patio seating. My mom decided that it would be too cold to sit outside in a 57 degree weather so we decided to sit indoors right next to their patio seating area. Even at this time, the restaurant was pretty much filled up. n nIt's a pretty long walk from the self parking lot at the Paris hotel to this restaurant. We were getting lost trying to figure out where it was. You have to pass all the shops and the casino lobby area to the very front of the hotel. Don't wear heels. The food here is definitely worth trying out for brunch breakfast. n nStrawberry waffles 5 stars! Very crunchy made with buttermilk batter and topped with fresh strawberries. Goes well with their warm maple syrup. Very light and not heavy. n nHam and Cheese omelette with gruyere cheese 4 stars. My mom ordered this and she seemed to be happy with her dish. Came with bread 5 stars I just can't seem to remember the type of bread but it was delish! The hash browns were flaky and excellent. n nCrepes BF ordered this dish but we were both not too pleased with the texture and overall taste. I'd skip on their crepes. 2 stars. n nFrench onion soup Yeah, it's 9 for a big cup of soup. BUT, it's worth every sip! We ended up fighting for the cheeeeeeeese! Not too salt unlike other soups I've tried. This is one soup I'd come back and order again! Must order as an appetizer. Big enough to share with two people. 5 stars! n n nCoffee Very good coffee. They are very good about offering refills whenever your cup is half way done. 5 stars n n nService Top notch! 5 stars! Outstanding service from the minute you walk into the restaurant. n nAmbience LOVE it! Wish they had a location in LA because I'd be a frequent customer!",2
"AMAZING Scallop dish! All three of our dinners were great. We had a hard time ranking the other two, but Scallops were wonderful. Servers were wonderful. We sat at the community table and watched the kitchen. They were amazing as they worked in harmony! Highly recommend this restaurant. I also recommend reservations!",2
"Maybe Im just fickle. but I love the idea of choosing my own toppings for my pie! This has fast become my girls nite takeout place. Too many girls, too many desires!

"I discovered Las Vegas ATV Tours via Groupon and read some of the mixed but mostly good review via Trip Advisor and Yelp. Overall, it seemed like everyone was super happy with their tour. n nCommunication is a little spotty at times, but mainly because it's a mom and pop kind of business and everyone works in that joint. After a tour is when these guys respond to your emails and phone calls. n nWe signed up for the One Hour Tour. John picked us up from The Four Seasons Hotel along with other folks from different hotels on the strip and we headed towards the Motor Speedway where they dropped us off next to the Airforce base. It's about a 30 mins drive. To begin with, I have never driven an ATV before, but I owned a scooter for seven years and have driven a motorcycle, so I am well aware of how to dress on a moving vehicle. However, a few of the gals did not. n nGirls be smart, not stupid. Wear pants and choose the morning session in the summer. It's simply too hot to do this tour in the middle of the afternoon. You'll die. Second, wear moisture wicking clothes as you will sweat and pour water all over your body. Bring a light long sleeved shirt. The sun is strong and no matter how much sunscreen you apply, you'll be thankful for the coverage when the wind picks up and sand is blowing onto your bare arms. Second, wear old tennis shoes. Not TOMS, not Keds, not sandals. Again, don't be an idiot, you are in the desert on a 4 wheeler. The pedals have metal prongs and you need protection from the heat of the engine. n nLast, bring a small backpack filled with water, extra sunscreen, ibuprofen, kleenex i.e. toilet paper , chapstick and a bandana. While the group gives you a water during the half time break, they only bring enough water for one bottle per person. It's hot outside and the heat definitely got to me. I wish I would have brought extra water and a bandana to cover my mouth from all the dirt. n nNow, onto the tour. I thought it was amazing. The guys are tatted up, smoke and good ole' boys they know what they are doing. They did a great job describing what we would be doing and the hand signals to follow. They also had extra riders to round up the caboose and let the girls ride tandem in the event they were too scared to drive an ATV. They warm you up with an easy start filled with small bumps and hills. As you become more comfortable with the ATV, you have the option to be more aggressive as you trust the machine over time. They definitely make it clear to do whatever you feel most comfortable with and they never make you feel stupid for taking it slow and careful. They know the area like the back of their dry, tan hands and do their job well. n nHonestly, a one hour would have sufficed for me, as it's hot and physically exhausting, but we winded up riding two hours. I'm not complaining, it was great fun, but for a retreat recreation I am planning in September, I would recommend to my older clients to perhaps consider just an hour as it is very physically demanding. Also, your gas is in what looks like a gear shift on your right handle bar, it's a lot of strain to your right hand it doesn't work like a motorcycle. So be prepared for some terrible texting, post tour. n nI winded up flying over a ""Witch's Eye "" and into a dune, causing me to almost flip over the handlebars. I didn't, but winded up jamming my right thigh into the throttle and right handlebar. It left a nasty bruise, cut and whiplash, but it was all worth it. The staff was great they made sure I was OK, gave me water and asked several times if I wanted to stop and go back. I assured them I was OK, and while I definitely felt it the next day.and today.I am still so happy I did the tour. It was great to get out into the desert, out of the strip, see the jets fly above you and meet some new people. I definitely would recommend this group and Casey as your guide. To make this trip more enjoyable be prepared, not a dumb ass. n nLunch is provided afterwards and the team is eager to take group photos. If you are ever in Vegas and looking for something different to do, give them a a call and go in the morning!",2
"Let me be clear, the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because we did end up with the car we reserved, it was a great car, and because we purchased through Costco, we didn't have any of the long lines or billing issues other people have experienced. Otherwise, it definitely would have been 1 star experience. n nI didn't bother really reading reviews before I booked, because I figured if Costco worked with them, it would be OK, but let me just say that there was nothing ""fastbreak "" about our Budget Fastbreak experience. n nYes, the rental center is far from the airport and it is a pain, but most airports are going to this model, so it is what it is. n nWe had reserved a convertible. When we arrived to get our car, there was a lot of background discussion. Turns out that the Budget ""marketing department "" had all 9 convertibles ""locked down "" and there wasn't a single one available to us or so we were being told. The rather rude attendant called a manager about 3 times before he answered his phone and his solution was to ""upgrade "" us to a luxury Hyundai for a day, and then we could come back and they would try and get us into a convertible the next day. Seriously? Maybe in his world that is a solution. n nWe argued with the attendant for a while who insisted that they couldn't possibly release a convertible to us because they didn't have keys to the cars. Really? You have cars and no keys? At this point, my husband asked to speak to the manager directly and quite firmly told him that we had booked a convertible, we knew they had convertibles available, and it was going to be terrible marketing if we didn't end up driving out in a convertible. And, I guess the manager finally agreed, because the next thing we heard over the intercom was the instruction to release a convertible. n nBut, they wouldn't make it easy. First, they had to dig one out and then they wanted to get it ready for us, wash, etc. They said 10 15 minutes more. We had been there over 30 minutes. Now, if they truly had these cars held for a ""marketing "" purpose, don't you think they would already be clean? At this point, our rude attendant up and leaves and another guy, who has no idea what is going on, takes her place. My husband walks over to Avis to see if they have any convertibles.they don't. So we wait. n nFinally, after we had been there 45 minutes, a brand new red Mustang convertible shows up, we get the keys and are on our way. The car, itself, was great. n nWhen we returned the car, we were running late, but they did have several people on the return line. We ended up with another rude attendant who was personally going to check every item on the car and put the top up. I asked her for the receipt because we were late, and she snapped that she had a process. So, I just left without a receipt. It was only today, as I was reading other people's experiences that I raced to check my credit card and luckily, we were only charged what Costco said we would be charged. n nSo, I guess the moral is, if you are going to use Budget in Vegas, go through Costco for pricing, but be prepared for lousy service.",1
"So, this isn't a product review, because you either know what Fossil sells, or you don't, and you either really like the items, or you don't. n nI like Fossil stores. Even though the products are sold in department stores everywhere , it's still convenient to be able to go to a store dedicated to Fossil's own unique style.

"With all the good reviews of this place, I found it quite below average. Sorry, you get a FAIL. First I got the wrong salad arugula but it was decent wanted the field green . I ordered a local craft beer red hydrant , but it was 14 and really more of an Irish Red and it tasted very Euro so it was poorly labeled . I got the ahi tuna tacos, that were tiny, yet very good, even though the corn taco shell dominated the overall flavor. nI ordered the braised short ribs, that was really just a giant RIB as in only one big one . it was not that good, and it's really hard to screw up SHORT RIBS. It also had this weird FOAM on top of it that looked like a fuzzy mold. The parsnip puree had a very weird texture. That was POOR, D but I ate the whole thing. nThe Wild Mushrooms were terrible. They had no flavor, nor even tasted like anything was added to them, other than the earthy natural flavor. The polenta wasn't bad, but boring! nWe passed on three other restaurants for this place?

The people who work there are also very friendly and really helpful. We have never had any problems with our food or service and we will continue to go there.,2
"After having my 3 children in 4 years and over 30 years old , my body was not bouncing back in any way. 2 co workers that were on this program encouraged me to make my appt.

I've seen clients in office look fabulous especially neck ! My first appt is next week, and I will update with results! So excited!",2
"There weren't many options in this wing of Charlotte's airport, and we were starving, but had we read the reviews we would have skipped Stock Car Cafe. As others have noted, service was prompt and fine, but the food was so bland and boring for what you pay. I would rather have spent less for fast food and gotten the same quality for less.",1
"My cousin's usual ""hole in the wall "" Mexican restaurant does not serve beer, so we decided to try Nando's because it was close and we wanted beer after a 6 hr drive back from LA. Lucky we were not in a hurry because the service was slow considering the restaurant was not busy. We had to ask twice for our beer and three times for additional salsa! n nFortunately the food was better than the service. I had Alfredo's Green Chile Pork. The Hatch green chile sauce was great. However, the whole beans were a bit ""crunchy "" for my liking. n nNext time I'm in town I'll go to the ""hole in the wall "" and have a Coke.",1
"Man some of these reviews are harsh. nBut you know I think Noodle ChaCha is doing a decent job. They are a new restaurant. Anyway I had takeout a few days ago. Ordered HK noodles, chowfun with gravy, and teriyaki beef bowl. Got a free app with a coupon and had the duck sliders and also ordered the milk tea. Milk tea came out first super sweet, aillte too sweet but it was still pretty good. Got my food and brought it home for the family. I tried the duck sliders, and I got to say they were pretty darn tasty. The duck had some fat and was crispy, the bun was soft and tasty. I think it was the best thing I ordered. Tried the other food with the family, the HK noodles were good, the sauce was fine, and the noodles crispy, The chow fun was really oily, but it tasted like it was suppose to. The beef on the other hand wasn't what we expected. It was really thin, like the beef in pho, had no teriyaki and there was so much rice. I would not order that again. Overall it was pretty good, They have some flaws, but I think they can fix it on the upcoming months. It is a bit pricey but it is near by my house, so if I do want noodles I will come by and get some.",2
"I love this place! The food tastes great I like that they have a whole bean burrito with avocado slices in it. Their iced tea is good too.Plus they sell a great refillable cup and you get a much cheaper drink when you bring it with you. I use the cup all the time too at my desk. They also recently started using regular plates and silverware in the restaurant, reducing trash. love when chain restaurants do this. It shows that you can still make a profit and reduce waste. n nYou can also call in your order and use the drive thru window to pick it up. that's convenient! n nThe only reason I dropped off a star on the rating is this if you order food there you get a side of chips included. If you order food to go you have to pay for the side of chips. What the heck is that about?",2
"Super tasty thai food and I'll admit i was weary to enter.its in a back lot and very small but bar far this the best Thai I've had in Vegas in my 5 years living here. We had the combination platter, which was awesome but we did not need with the portion sizes they gave on the entrees to start then the pineapple fried rice and the thai spice noodle with beef. Both were sooo good! Prices were reasonable as well.",2
I was in Scottsdale for a bachelorette party and unfortunately it was a chilly day. Our group was looking for something to do to occupy our time. Blow Dry Bar by Kimberly was very accommodating to our group of 7. They managed to fit us all in even though it was prom night in the area.something that dry bar down the street would not do. n nWe had a great time with the girls.they allowed us to bring in our makeup and get ready. We basically took over the place. All of us looked awesome afterwards and went out for a great dinner. I would definitely recommend this place. The girls are so nice here.,2
"I want to like Icon. I've dined here 4 5 times over the years and I keep coming back because I think that it must be improving because it stays open, but I'm now convinced that it exists solely based upon its proximity to the Overture Center. n nThe food is average. The service is average at best. They do have a decent wine selection at a fairly moderate price point. That may be the high point, along with a decent cocktail menu. n nThe tapas menu is inventive, but not well executed. n nLast evening, the patatas bravas were overcooked and the sauce was very uninspired. n nThe crab cake was too much breading and not enough crab and only one crab cake for 12 does not seem like a good value. n nThe stuffed piquillo peppers were served too cold, and the cous cous accompanying them was bland and flavorless. It had clearly been microwaved, too, instead of reheated properly. n nLastly, the short rib served with manchego mashed potatoes sounded divine, but it was stringy and not a good cut of meat. The potatoes were fine, but very light on manchego. The sauce was the highlight, but Icon's kitchen was not very generous with it. n nTwo diners left disappointed, not full at all, after four tapas and one drink each for 86. n nIcon neither a good meal nor a good deal.",1

"Oh. my. lord. n nWent to Savor Scottsdale's Notorious P.I.G. event at Digestif and can't even put into words how great everything was. All the credit does not go to Payton Curry, as each course was from a different chef and a different part of the same pig, but WOW. Chef Curry was certainly the entertainment for the evening, with personality that just doesn't quit. And having him gush to our table about his Easter Sunday menu, beginning with carrot soup, ending with carrot cake, and everything rabbit in the middle, I will certainly be visiting Digestif more often. We've also seen him at the farmer's market, picking out the freshest produce he can find. it's not just a schpeel, this guy is serious about utilizing local ingredients. n nAnyway, back to the pig. Every course was made to perfection, half of which I had never heard of before. and paired perfectly by Todd Bostock with Dos Cabezas wines. I could go on for pages, but suffice it to say that you all should support your local chefs and watch out for more great events from Savor Scottsdale, a non profit organization working to put Scottsdale on the map as a culinary destination. n nProps to Chef James Porter of Tapino, Chef Aaron May of Sol y Sombra, Chef Brandon Crouser of Atlas Bistro, and Chef Tracy Dempsey of Cowboy Ciao, et al.

"We used to go here when it was BoomBozz because we liked the food and beer selection but the service was terrible, especially towards the end. We decided to try it again now that it has changed names and owners. Beer selection is still pretty good, but the service is still pretty bad and the food is ""meh "" at best. n nWe walked in, were seated immediately, and then told our server was missing. Not a problem we thought, someone else took our drink order, and then never returned. Several minutes later a man I saw smoking in the parking lot when we drove in came to the table and announced he would be taking our order. Glad he got his smoke break in while we waited with children on a busy Saturday night. Awesome. n nFrom there the service was REALLY SLOW and at times non existent. When the food came the order was wrong for my daughter but they did quickly fix it which I really appreciated. I can't say much else about the food except that it was just bland. Mac and cheese was bland. Pizza was bland. Everything bland. So much potential. I mean, it is all basically comfort food, and there was nothing special there at all. n nThere are so many other places in the area with a better beer selection and much better food and service. We will probably not be back.",1
"Clean, classy, and like a blast from the past. n nI have fond memories of visiting a See's Candy store as a kid smelling the fresh chocolate and letting my gaze wander over the amazing selection of chocolates. n nNot much has changed in 20 30 years. And to be honest, I think that's a good thing. n nThe showroom might seem sterile and, well . 'white'. Almost like a really clean and spacious bathroom . n nBut be sure to ask for whatever samples they might have available they won't even make you buy anything but I dare you to walk out without giving some of your money to those nice old ladies that work behind the counter . n nI've taken my two daughters there 11 and 8 and they keep asking me when we're going to go back. The staff at See's Candy's really seem to know how to treat kids nicely. n nI'd give this place 5 stars, but their prices are a bit high. You do get a quality product, but you definitely pay for it.",2
"Was here with my buddy Sat 13 Jul about 9 30 pm. n Nice new bar, standard Strip strip cocktail prices, easy to find seats, good service from the waitress n Best part was the people watching since we had a good view of the ladies in line to get in to Hakkasan which opens at 9 pm on Sat 13 Jul but I think the line was already forming before then because Tiesto was playing that night ",2
"As a family we eat sushi every week, mainly high end and we have our favorite local spots and vacation spots. In Vegas, specifically off the Strip its barMasa and Sushi Roku. We were excited to try Blue Ribbon Sushi and hopefully find a new spot. This is extremely important to my review. We had just come off a huge winning streak and were in amazing high spirits and just plain happy from winning. We walked in on time to our reservations and the place was dead, 2 people at the sushi bar and two reservations seated at tables. We asked if we could have a booth as the seating at the tables looked old. Immediately we were told absolutely not and were led to a small table. The chairs are old 60's style fabric covered front office reception chairs. Terribly low if you are over 6' and uncomfortable with the arm rests fabric mostly rubbed off. They placed us directly next to the other couple with no one in the restaurant. My girl asked where she could place her purse as there was no place to hang it on the fabric chairs. The waiter said she could place it behind her back on the chair or on the floor. She held onto it in her lap. The waiter's attitude to us was atrocious. Rude as if we were bothering him by eating there. Our joy from winning quickly faded. We ordered our drinks, garlic Edamame and some entr u00e9e rolls and sashimi. As no one was at the restaurant, we got our sushi rolls and sashimi in less than 4 minutes. No complaints on the food, but it wasn't great either. If you have unpleasant seating and a rude waiter but the food is truly amazing you can always look past these items. I ordered a couple of 30 specialty items to see if they were good. When I asked if we could get our garlic Edamame the waiter told me I never ordered any. At this point we've spent over 140 and have only upset him by being in the restaurant for 20 minutes. Instead of bringing Edamame ordered twice he comes back and asks if we wanted any dessert?!?!?! One other couple came in and were also seated in the center table section. Lost our happiness of winning briefly until we could get out of this place. We paid and ate regular sushi nothing special here and were rushed to eat and leave in less 30 minutes. Never got the Edamame. Our mistake to try this place, we will be sure to go back to barMasa and Sushi Roku were waiters have class and poise for clients paying 150 300 and looking for a nice relaxing evening with great drinks and excellent sushi.",1
This place rocks! Cade is a great server. Try the Chicken Rolls! Get extra jalape u00f1o sauce!,2
"Ok. If you like ice cream. Hands down best ice cream everrrrrr! I've only written a few reviews for anything on Yelp but it is worth my time to write a review. nEspecially for those who are Peanut butter crazies, you HAVE TO, MUST TRY their PB Ice cream. It has the perfect PB consistency that all us PB lovers adore nDrop everything you are doing and just go to Udder Delights! nThe staff is so sweet and I can tell they really take pride in their job. nThe Butter Pecan was also amazing! Perfect flavors and unlike other ice creams where it's too hard or it just tastes so artificial, it's smooth and yet cold and icy enough! nJust stop reading this and go check them out! You won't regret it ",2
"Until around a year ago, this was the best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas and remains a favorite. On our most recent visit we ordered naan, basmati rice, chicken tika marsala and rata lamb. We received naan, basmati rice, chicken tika marsala and rata chicken. Not a problem because we have never had rata chicken or rata lamb or rata anything for that matter. Each entre was both flavorful and spicy. Service remains attentive.",2
"I had a fabulous stay here. I tried to book the Firesky but it was sold out, so a co worker suggested the Valley Ho. I had no idea it was a palace of retro funkiness. Nish said it was a Shag painting come to life, and I couldn't agree more. I had a moonlight swim, a waffle at the breakfast bar, and an all around swank time. It was swell!",2
Came for brunch and fell even more in love. Bottomless mimosas and awesome food selections. Sweet and savory selections for all your breakfast cravings. Great atmosphere and will now be my brunch go to. Makes for a fun southside adventure during the day.,2
Watch for what they charge you for. Ordered the kids meal and still got charged for full combo. Chicken taquitos. Sick all night. At least I got thru the concert before it hit me. Maybe it was the green hot sauce?,1
Stay away from curries they are watered down. Friendly people cozy atmosphere. All I tried was chicken tikka masala and it's not up to par.,1
"This past Friday, I was downtown with some friends, one who had turned 40 and had never been to a comedy club before, so why not! Tickets were only 22! Wow, ok, to see comedians from Chealsea Lately show, ok why not! n nWe received 2 for 1 drink passes to go to the bar next door and they would give us a buzzer to get in prior to people waiting in line. Ok that seems like a great deal! Umm.the 2 for 1 has to be the same drink, the waitress somewhat rude, and kept asking if we wanted food.nor did she tell us that we can bring the second drink into the show with us.9 45 came and went, and they were still not allowing people in. n nWhen we finally got in, we got center area in the second seating area, so people were walking past us all the time! And I mean ALL the time even with the comedians performing! Seriously, people don't have to get a drink that much! At least , do it between acts! But no, all through the show. n nSo our waitress, rude and just unfriendly.2 drink min., of course some prices were not on the menu.a coke 3 in a plastic cup, seriously! And then I was asked at least 2 times,to get my 2nd drink, during the acts! Seriously, can I watch the show! I just asked for a bottled water to go, she came back with the cap off, so I asked for the cap and she did bring me a new one. 5 for water. I got the macaroni and cheese and it was just horrible for it to be 12.so our check was around 50. I wouldn't complain, if it was good but it wasn't at all. And again, people in front of us the whole time! Even the waitress were standing in front of us, taking the peoples orders in front of us. And like everyone else, we had to wait afterwards for the bill which already had the gratuity added, nor did we add more, service did not deserve it. n nComedians were ok, not as funny as I thought they would be. n nAll in all, I probably won't go back. I went to StandUp Scottsdale and had a totally different experience for the better. I would've thought this club was in Scottsdale and Stand Up Scottsdale was located in Phoenix.",1
"Be careful who you give your money to here. nDon't think that just because it is nice, and bright, and clean, that it is anything other than a car dealership, waiting to RIP YOU OFF. n nSubaru's are great cars and there is really only one place to get them in Vegas. Be smart! Just because it's an excellent product doesn't mean they won't try to screw around. I bought the car I wanted, because I wanted it, despite the sales people rubbing me wrong from the start. n nThis review is regarding a recent issue. I am going to leave the Service Manager out of this, because I honestly believe he was just doing what he was told and was trying to help. Also, all things considered, the service team still did a good job on the work, kept to the scheduled deadline, and communicated everything I needed to know. I used to LOVE just bringing my car in for service and sitting in the waiting area. n nI purchased a warranty when I got my car in the summer of 2011. At a routine service in 2013, I was given a list of things that needed to be fixed. When I asked if my warranty covered those items, no one knew what I was talking about. It took three days for me to get a call back indicating that it was covered and we were all good. They would call to schedule the repair when the parts were in. nThat call never came. n nI scheduled the next maintenance just recently. At that appointment, I was given a new list of things that needed to be fixed or replaced. I again asked if the warranty covered it, and was again met with ""what are you talking about? "" n nSo, here is where I not only start getting crapped on, but find out that, had I not raised the issue, the money I spent over two years ago would never have been recorded, however someone would still have gotten credit, and a bonus for selling it to me. n nA cluster F of phone calls ensue, were departments are blaming each other, telling me to call someone else. The warranty company, Subaru of America, has no record that I ever purchased the services and instructs me to contact the dealership. The dealership instructs me to contact the servicer. I talk to four people. I am told that I do not have a warranty. If they can find it, someone will get back to me. n nBut before I ever hear back about that, I get a Customer Service follow up call. After explaining everything listed here and that I am not happy because I keep willingly spending my money there and no one is on the same page. I am told that someone will get back to me. I ask to just spoke to the General Manager, so that I can actually get the help I need. I accept the answer that I will get a call back. n nI e mailed back asking for a full explanation of the issue and that the General Manager is copied on the response. I receive a one line response asking that I call. Because paper trails are dangerous. n nWould you believe that 15 minutes later, my warranty magically reappears, my work was covered, AND I has an appointment scheduled for Saturday? That's pretty impressive. nHowever, there was no explanation given and the GM was not copied on the message. which is interesting, because, again, I asked for something very specific and did not get it. nI asked again for an explanation and received ""Clerical error by someone who does not work here anymore "", which is exceeding convenient for a manager trying to avoid responsibility for his team, regardless of when it happened. Just ""it's all fixed now, see you Saturday. "" n nYou may also notice that there was no good will offer to make up for the error. Just ""hey, we screwed up, made you do the leg work to prove it, you caught us, ha ha, now keep paying for services, because we are the only Subaru dealership in town "". n nI specifically asked on several occasions, several different ways, for something a little more substantial, and was eventually offered 10 off other recommended services, for which I already have a 15 off coupon and all of which I can do myself in the garage. n nI wasn't offered a free oil change, or an air filter, or even one of those neat Team Subaru hats. n nSo, overall, the problem is that no one accepted responsibility. No one did anything to actually fix the anger and frustration n nEvery person I have talked to has made sure to blame someone else and the problem has yet to be resolved. n nIn the end, I SOLD MY CAR just so I would not have to deal with the only Subaru Dealership in Las Vegas. You should be embarrassed. n nBusinesses spend loads of money sourcing customers. It seems silly to my that you'd lose a loyalist over unprofessional behavior.",1
Fantastic.got me an ultimate skillet. season well.,2
Love love love this place. I can always rely on a good breakfast from them. Thank you.,2
This is such a great place! So happy it started. The experience is very relaxing and pleasant. The free mimosa's don't hurt either The owner was very nice and helpful and provides you with a silky soft robe and the spray tan is new to AZ and smells amazing. I highly recommend!,2
"Went in this afternoon, and after watching Bar Rescue Im much more aware of things. First, took 10 mns to get the server. Ask for drink recommendation and was served in the same glasses I bought at Walmart with a white straw. No drink glass or drink straw.thumbs down. Ordered the boneless buffalo wings, took 20 mins to get the food. It comes out in a stand that you serve fries in. Food was awful, and was more like chicken nuggets. The drink had no liquor in it. I wont be going back. Its too bad because I have had food there before and drinks and it was decent. Oh yea, the cherry on top is that Ive had gas for 5 hrs since eating there. UGH!",1
Service was great. Food is crap. I'm pretty sure everything is taken out of the freezer and cooked in the microwave.,1
"This restaurant is great. It's relatively cheap but the food is quality, the servers are extremely friendly and helpful, and the restaurant has a nice ambiance to it. You can sit at what I assume to be African style dining tables, on the floor, or at a table if you prefer. n nThis place is great if you're vegan or vegetarian especially when going out to eat with people who aren't, because there's plenty options for both. n nI'd recommend the vegetable samosas, baba ghannouj my personal favorite and then getting one of the vegetable or meat dishes with 5 different 'platters,' which are sort of like tapas or dim sum but with flavorful African middle eastern flavors.",2
"I wanted to surprise my wife for her birthday and take her to get her hair done. Chris did an amazing job, my wife is hard to please when it comes to her hair and she walked out 100 satisfied.

One of the best shows I've seen in Vegas. The stunts are fantastic and all the water effects are unique from any other show. Definitely worth checking out.,2
"I struggle to find what people like about this place. Food is mediocre, service is typically slow, prices are nothing special. It doesn't have a local quaint atmosphere to help it along either. n nEverything about this place is completely shruggable. If there is no place left on your list to go, by all means eat here. But for me, I'll pass.",1

" ""Welllllcome to Wal Mart "" says the toothless greeter at the front door, as you enter a store crawling with hobos, crackheads and screaming, obese, rampant illegals. Most product descriptions are of course in spanish and you can expect the store to be 100 unsanitary with employees that seem to be in a constant, drunken stuper. You can't walk to your car without being harrassed by hooking panhandlers and desperate illegals looking for work. I avoid this place at ALL costs and travel the extra mile to Target or Fry's in a less horrid environment!",1
"you need to come here for their happy hour, when their sushi prices are cheap! I don't like spending too much money for dinner, so I avoid the grill, but happy hour is a completely different story, two can dine with drinks included for under 25 total!",2
"This bar is tucked away on train tracks and not quite what is considered ""downtown. "" But it is the definition of a hidden gem. Mostly a tiny sports bar, you can feel the history here, and you really drink it in. n nFood is available, and it's typical bar fare, but just link the drinks, the price is right. They have slot machines, as any classic Wisconsin bar should have. The Long Islands are good, but if the place wants a 5 star rating, they have to upgrade the televisions. Other than that, stop in for any Kohl center event and you won't be disappointed. I don't think it gouges you like any of the Regent bars on football Saturdays, either.",2
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS, especially for COLOR. I bought the 59 Groupon for shampoo, cut, color and that is the WORST purchase I've ever made. Dawn was my stylist and colorist. I asked for BLONDE highlights to fill in the grow out from my last highlights. She told me that would cost extra because the Groupon was for color, not highlights. Fine. She did foils and then painted on a ""base "" color. No other colorist has ever done that, so I was immediately worried. Then she set the timer for 45 minutes. The highlights had already been sitting there for 15 20 minutes by then. So it was over an hour for the bleach. Normal time for me under heat is 15 minutes. After shampooing and trimming, she told me that a blow out was extra and I asked her to just blow out part of it because I didn't like the way the color looked.So my hair was WAY over processed and came out looking a pinky orange blond. Kind of like the old self tanner color except on hair. I hated it and asked her to add low lights to tone it down. Another 45 minutes passed in this ugly, hole in the wall salon. She shampooed and combed me out and it was STILL hideous, but I wanted to get the HELL out of there, so I paid another 49 on top of the Groupon and left. Now I'm left with a hideous mess, my hair is dry and straw like, and I'll have to go somewhere else to get it fixed. Then it will probably fall out. Again, DON'T GO HERE FOR BLONDE HIGHLIGHTS.",1
"Worst McDonalds ever! n nWas headed out to San Diego so I decided to stop here in the drive through to get some food. Horrible! Should have went somewhere else.ANYWHERE ELSE! n nI placed my order for a McDouble and a 6 piece McNuggets. I paid the man my money and then sat there. There were 2 cars ahead of me and they were not moving. It took 8 minutes for the 2 cars ahead of me to get their food. That is painstakingly slow for a fast food restaurant. When the car immediately in front of me did not pull away once she got her food, I knew something was up. I saw her have to ask for straws, napkins, and salt and pepper packets. It is now my turn to pull up to the window to get my food. The lady hands me a bag without any expression at all and says ""here you go "". I took my bag and then got on the freeway. A mile down the road, I open the bag. No dipping sauce for my McNuggets and no fucking napkins! I HATE THAT SHIT! Lazy ass workers who don't do their job. I was pissed! The food itself even tasted a bit off. The burger was luke warm and the McNuggets were rubbery and seemed like they had been sitting out awhile. n nFor damn sure I will NEVER come back to this McDonalds! I've never had a problem in 36 years on earth at any McDonalds, EVER. This one was fucking horrible! Avoid at all costs!",1
"On a unseasonably warm February evening, hubs and I ventured out for some eats. Since we both had fairly light lunches we were starvin' marvins. After attempting to stop by a handful of places closed on Monday or an hour long wait we settled on Snoop's, hopin' for a hot and fresh burger. n nInside, Snoop's leaves a lot to be desired. I'm not a dull knife in the drawer, and it took me a little while to figure out the, um, theme of the burger joint. Snoop's.as in detectives.snooping.i saw a Bond poster too. Ok, sure.I didn't really care about the overall ambiance as long as the food was solid. n nAnd how about the food? Well, it's pricier than other old school grilles to the tune of 15 for two 1 3 lb. burger combos and a corn dog. This wouldn't really bother me much if the food was better. The burger was fine passable, but very well done as in quite brown and essentially flavorless. Onion rings were clunk ily breaded and with little flavor and fries were ""meh "" overall. I was looking for the salty little slivers of love with some crisp! n nService wasn't super inviting and the cash register attendant didn't even hint at a smile when we ordered. As soon as cash was in hand, she went back to her computer adjacent to the counter. With a sanitation score barely above 90 and the flavorless eats, I have indeed experienced some better burger joints in the QC.",1
I was surprised at the cover charge for anvempty bsr. Great service but no people and the bland atmosphere put me to sleep. No reason to return with 5 cover.,1
from the outside and inside appears to be a fast food place. Inside its nothing special. We ordered our food to go. Got home was missing a few items. No need to even mention what we go as none of it was good. There's way better BBQ places within a few miles. Don't bother.,1

"I used to be a huge Pei Wei fan, but the past few times we've gone there especially last time I've been EXTREMELY disappointed. nI go to Pei Wei for the spring rolls and the chicken lettuce wraps. We usually order for lunch, so their lunch combos were always great because they came with an eggroll or spring roll. But recently they've changed their menu so I ended up with Pei Wei Spicy Beef combo which, per usual, had chewy meat, not enough sauce and too much rice. I also ordered the Thai lettuce wraps and let me just say STAY AWAY FROM THESE! It was such a confusion of flavors. it was tangy and there was the hint of cilantro and mint. MINT! Gross! My boss took one bite and almost puked, he's a bit picky so I tried it and almost puked as well. We also ordered the Steak Lettuce wrap which was gross too. Super disappointing. nThis place is way too pricy and now that they've essentially eliminated the ONLY thing I like there. they can close up shop as far as I'm concerned. nI'd prolly eat here again if it was thee LAST place open and McDonald's has exploded. But for now, if I never eat here again, it'll be too soon.",1
I would only recommend this place for the drinks! I find it odd that a Mexican food place doesn't sell chips and salsa or beans! The main side for food is fries! It's really weird! I think they should rethink their menu!' For this reason I give them 2 stars! n nI had a chicken spinach salad and it was decent!,1
"bartenders always friendly, nice to come by here after work with all my co workers and relax for a bit. easy going atmosphere and hh pricing always good!",2
There is an asian lady there.that is so helpful everytime I go in. I must get her name! nLook for her in the store if you need anything. She goes above and beyond and that is very unusual.,2
"I hate the all day music here. it's the WORST place to do work have a conversation. n nI don't like the dark back room. I don't like the way it's hard to plug in your laptop. I just don't really like it here. n nThe coffee service food is good, though. I just can't stand the rest of it.",1
"They had what sounded like a good special for Valentine Day turned out to be a joke. Food was of poor quality, and way over priced. Food in the past was good here. The place was always busy. Recent visits not so. Disappointing. Cool place for at least drinks, now I dont even consider it as an option.",1
"I have nothing positive to say about my experience at Firefly on Paradise. The service was the most awful thing ever. I was in management for a Forbes rated the hotel for a long time, and I would be seriously embarrassed if my team ever acted like this team. n nWe were sat at a table outside, and then we were left for 20 minutes before anyone checked in on us. During this time, all the tables around us were being serviced. I watched the waiter check in with several tables. 25 minutes into this experience the busser brought waters, and the waiter came over. He didn't say Hello, he said what do you want to drink. I was expecting some type of reason why he was ignorning us. The paito wasn't that full. He took the order and left. During this time the manager was walking around the patio area. n nI also watched the manager of Firefly mingle with what appeared to his friends and several other tables except ours. During this time, the manager made eye contact with me four times I was giving the look of hey how's it going can you please assist me , but he failed to do anything. He started to walk our direction, and I was about to speak up to him, but he turned his focus to a table full of young women. The service should be the focus, I can understand if you are speaking with your guests, but this was not the case. He continued to check in on what appeared to be his friends and tables full of young women. Each time he did this he was chatting it up for several minutes. n nWe were still waiting for our drinks at this point about 35 minutes into our experience. At this point, we had to walk up to the bar to get our drinks because no one returned with them. The manager also was at the bar during this interaction and failed to say anything. We mentioned our experience to the bartender and the manager could have said something, but he didn't. n nOverall, the waiter seemed mad he had to work, and the only person who was doing anything positive was the busser. We asked our busser at one point to get send over the waiter so we could order another round. The busser walked over to the waiter, and the waiter disappeared for several minutes before coming to our table. n nDuring this time, the waiter made eye contact with our table, and then walked away. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I then watched him walk inside and stand by a curtain. He wasn't doing anything for a good five minutes, and then he finally came back out, went to another table and walked away. I had to wave him over, which I hate doing, because it is rude, however, there was no other way to get his attention. n nEventually, our food came out, and the waiter continued to be short with us. The food was good, but the service at this place was awful. I think the thing that rubbed me the worst about this place was that the manager failed to step in and show any interest in our situation. He seemed consumed with talking to women rather than doing his job. This was my perception last night. n nI hope everyone else doesn't experience this while you are at this establishment. Maybe it was an off night, either way, the service was horrible. The only reason we didn't leave was because our friend loves Firefly and it was her birthday. n nI also witnessed several staff members on their phones, I can't believe this place.get your standards in with the rest of this city!",1
The parking lot sets the tone with being nestled in a big bunch of trees. nMy wife had a salad and a soup. I had a barbeque pork sandwich and a bowl of bean soup w ham.lots of ham. Everything was delicious. The barbequewas moist and tender. The admosphere is very nice. The service was great. The prices are reasonable for what you get. nHad a wonderful lunchtime experience.,2
"I think the food was probably close to the best steak house we've had but the service was comparable to Denny's. We initially waited 10 minutes to even be greeted by our server and the restaurant was close to empty. Our water glasses were never filled. We noticed that they didn't have porterhouses on the menu so when we asked she ""forgot "" to mention their house specials for the evening, being porterhouses were the special. The food though, was cooked to perfection, sauteed spinach seasoned so well, warm spinach salad with a bacon vinaigrette type dressing that melted in my mouth and a stuffed sweet potato from the heavens! The porterhouses cooked exactly as ordered. The food buffered out the poor service but not enough to go back. It wasn't for the service this would be a five star place. They need to get some training from the high end waiters at Disneyland.",1
"Service is awful. Lady next to me to go to the bathroom, she was eating alone. They came by and cleared her table. She hadn't even started yet. Then I got the 3 corse meal and they forgot the first one and came out and threw his coworker under the buss. Your my waiter, own the situation. Then it took 20 min to get our check after we were done eating. We had napkins on the plates and everything.",1
This place is a dump. What happened? They could not even provide salt and pepper shakers. Seriously! And the bathroom stalls did not lock. Gross.,1
"Ain't no thang like a damn good chicken wang. n nI love watching football here. They are carefully sectioned off so you can sit with your team. It's pretty crowded on Sundays but the service is great. With great game day specials, it makes it easy on the wallet to order wings. their awesome seasoned french fries, burgers are half off on weekends and end everything with their better than Oreganos cookie pie. n nI know cookie pies are the thing but this place really knows how to make girls fat. Cooked in a skillet, the dough is still gooey in the center and topped with delicious vanilla ice cream. I just drooled on the keyboard typing this. n nCome on down to Half Moon to cheer on your favorite sports team!",2
"I have seen Dr Greenawalt for several years now. I enjoy all my appointments with him and find it beneficial for my everyday life. Dr Greenawalt specializes in alternative approach body talk and neurolink, which I completely rave about.",2

Come here for breakfast! It is nothing fancy but if you're looking for a great meal for a nice price Tryon House is the place to go. Get there early because this place get busy on the weekends for breakfast.,2
"Every once in a while, I really crave a hot dog. I've been searching Yelp for good hot dog reviews and decided to try the Hot Dog Stop. Tonight is our second trip to HDS so I thought it was time for my review. n nFirst time we both got the Bahamas Dogs, his with the grilled Polish sausage, mine with a grilled Hebrew National hot dog. Both were delicious though I personally will stick with the Hebrew Nationals. I like the fact that they serve the cheese sauce on the side a bit on the dog, a bit to dip fries in. Cole slaw was a touch bland, fries and onion rings were just fine. n nSecond time, I tried the New Yorker with Hebrew National grilled, he got the Chicago with Polish Sausage. I loved the New Yorker. Though real sauerkraut is usually a touch more tangy, I thought it was the right balance with the spicy mustard and the red onion. I'll have a hard time not ordering this one. I loved the peppers on the Chicago but it wouldn't be my first choice. n nTheir buns are awesome. The consistency and flavor of the grilled Hebrew Nationals was spot on a little crisp and smoky. One is enough for a meal but they're pretty cheap and delicious so two people would probably want to split three . n nWe got take out both times so I can't comment on much else. n nAll in all, a delicious dog. I will be back to sample more.",2
"Oh! Old Red Square I mourn you. n nWe head to Vegas at least twice year and ritually used to kick off our trip with kick ass double martinis and caviar at Red Square every time. Gone are those great martinis, replaced by over iced, over priced weak drinks and tiny portions of caviar. Gone too is the caviar hour. Boo! n nThe service is still good and I actually prefer the new menu, but we are going to have to find a new spot. Major bummer.",1
" ""Beer is proof that God loves man, and wants him to be happy "" Benjamin Franklin. I'm not personally religious. spiritual maybe? But if there is a higher power I would add that beer and Mexican food is the proof. For me this is the ultimate in comfort food. There is nothing that a cheesy greasy plate of Mexican food cant fix. or at least soften the blow. n nOver the past months I have subjected myself to countless mediocre mexican experiences. My favorite senoran Mexican place for years has been Carlos O'Briens. I know there HAS to be somewhere out there as good or better. So far its been a disappointing adventure, I have found a few places that had single better items. n nFinally I feel as if all these wasted calories finally paid off. Los Compadres. You have given me hope that I will find what I'm looking for. I walked out of there stuffed, with money left in my wallet, and a big smile on my face. With a few small improvements you would be my new favorite Mexican place. n nChips Salsa nThe salsa was great. It was a slightly chunkier version of the taco sauce you usually get in the squeeze bottles. The chips were crisp, thin, and lite. Although I find it hard to explain why they seemed lite when they were a bit on the oily side but somehow they were. Salted well but not overly. Well worth the 1 or whatever it was. Drain them a tad more and you would have perfect chips. n nCheese Crisp nI can't believe I am saying this but I think I have found my new favorite cheese crisp. It was the perfect crispy yet pliable texture. So freaking good I'm not even sure I put salsa on more then a few bites of it. The cheese was amazing. I think there was butter involved here somewhere. I WANT ONE NOW! n nGuac nAgain. shocked to say this. but tied with my current favorite. Not a a tomato to be found. The perfect balance of avocado, garlic, cilantro, peppers for heat, citrus. n nBeef Tamale nNot a star. With all the great food here I would not waste the stomach space. n nShredded Beef Taco nAlthough we all enjoyed them their are better tacos in the valley. One disappointing note was that right out of the kitchen every taco on the whole table was split down the middle from taco fail. It happens. I got over it. Saving grace was that they were stuffed then fried. mmmmmm extra grease D n nEnchilada nDelicious! The corn tortilla was not overpowering with corn flavor. The red sauce here is rich, thick, creamy, and smokey. If they were to salamander the enchiladas with the cheese on them before serving it would kick the ass of every other enchilada I've had in town. Since they use foam plates they can't do this. n nRelleno nFinally! This is probably the best senoran style relleno I've had outside of Mexico. I wasn't even a huge fan of the beef green chili on top and it was still amazing. Next time I will order it with the red enchilada sauce for what I'm sure will be the ultimate relleno. unless you feel like taking a trip to the friendly dolphin in rocky point. n nCarne Asada nChris ordered a Carne Asada burrito. This is not something I usually get unless I'm making it myself or at a ertos. He offered me a taste. WHoa! delicious. The marinade on this was amazing. There was a hint of something sweet. I would guess it had some orange juice or orange slices in the marinade. n nRice nIf I had to pick one thing that they absolutely need to improve on its the rice. Although the rice was cooked perfectly. The grains stayed intact and there was no mushiness to it at all. The flavor was just off and not great in general. As weird as it sounds the first few bites I had almost tasted floral. I think they could easily improve on this. This is a really important one guys! fixy please! n nBeans nPolar opposite of the rice. I'm not even a huge bean fan and these were great. Creamy, salty, rich, and definitely had some delicious lard in there. Its no wonder its mentioned again and again in the reviews. n n nPros nAmazing Combo Prices! nParking Lot This can be important in this part of town nPlenty Of Tables nQuick Service nFREAKING DELICIOUS n nCons nRice nTaco Fail nTamale n nMy Perfect Return Trip Meal nCarne Asada nChili Relleno Substitue green chili for red enchilada sauce nEnchilada nCheese Crisp Guac",2
We enjoyed a romantic dinner with excellent service from the owner at this charming restaurant in Old Montreal. We felt like we were dining in France! We chose the cheese plate for starters along with the dry red house wine. We chose fixed price meals spinach soup and a salad preceded baked turbot and grilled salmon both served with rice and perfectly cooked zucchini and a broiled tomato. Dessert was coconut cake and carrot cake a tad dry served with decaf espresso coffee. We would highly recommend to others and would gladly return ourselves to this gem.,2
"Nowhere can you find outlets to charge phones or tablets! What's up with that? This place is 15 years behind in making improvements that passengers need and want. I found one ""charging station "" that made it look like they were doing us a favor by providing a dozen outlets in one very small area. It's still fun to come here, but abandon hope ye who are low on battery life.",1
BJs is all over the place and in other states. I have enjoyed their food but i have to say the service is really suck. I was a server recently for over 6 years and i know what good service is. Im not going to complain about the food because the food its great! But they could MAJORLY improve on the service quality.,1
"My daughter talked me into having dinner here on a Friday afternoon in January 2014 about the time the Waste Management Open was going on. The ambiance reminded me of Gilligan Island meets Star Wars Bar. Except the bar area had the 50 plus retired Scottsdale Match.com hopefuls wishing they were millioniare Mr. Howells, holding down the seats. That sort of creeped me out, but I digress. The waiter was an exuberant fellow, and I guess he needed to be, because I took a gander at the prices and was a bit blown away. This place sits in a strip mall with Culver's and I guess they are banking on their business during the high season when the tourists don't know any better. I had a chicken dish that was a bit bland and oily. Needless to say, I do not recommend unless you are looking for a Mr. Howell wannabee and a free Mai Tai.",1
"The new Hard Rock Cafe is awesome! Got a chance to see Eve 6 last night and was impressed with the venue. Basically, the new Hard Rock Cafe is a three tier building of Rock N Roll fun. First floor is the walk in HRC store with all the cool shirts, hats, sweaters, etc. Quick escalator ride up to the second floor and your in the cafe. n nI personally didn't get a chance to grab a bite, but I've eaten at the Maui, Miami, and old Vegas cafes and have never been disappointed definitely review update . Take the stairs or elevator up to the third floor and you've reach the concert venue. n nThe top floor offers a great outdoor balcony with a splendid view of the Vegas strip. There is a large bar located on one side of the room and various locations with shot girls. The VIP side of the venue also offers free Coors Light and Blue Moon brew for the opening acts. Overall, I had a fantastic time and look forward to catching another event at the Hard Rock Cafe soon.",2
"Came in here for lunch with co workers. So glad we did! We shared the edamame which were done perfectly just enough kick but not too much. We shared some rolls a shrimp which I could not eat and pork. I couldn't get over how fresh everything tasted so far. Then I had the braised pork banh mi. The bread was a tad overpowering, however it was made up for with some amazing flavor. I had the garlic fries as my side which came with a delicious chipotle mayo dipper. The fries were to die for as well. n nService was amazing. We were in a time crunch, and he was attentitive, super helpful with the menu and quick bringing our check out while were were still eating so we could up and go. n nLoved the minimal modern decor with pops of color. n nAll around great experience and I can't wait to head back again!",2
"I excuse the high price I pay by the fact that I am too lazy to walk my arse over to the cheaper, not better Expresso Royale that is 2 3 blocks away. It's right by my department offices and when I have early meetings I swing in here right before to get caffeinated. n nThat being said, their Chai Latte with a shot of expresso is pretty good. n nThey do have free WiFi but I've only attempted to study here once. It was too dim and the chairs were uncomfortable and not situated at a good height with the table maybe I'm just short .",1

"This was formally known as Kan Kaizen Sushi. It's about 30 for dinner AYCE including tax. The hot tea is 2 each but during their Happy Hour it's buy two drinks get one free, so with four people it came down to 1.25 per. It's located on Flamingo and Arville in the plaza by the Starbucks. n nMy friends got here before I did, so they got us all a table, while of course waiting for me. It's a real nice place inside, loved the decor, very simple, elegant, and modern. There weren't that many people there when we were there, maybe around 20 ish people there including us. Service started promising, but as soon as the place started to fill up with only two servers, the service just went downhill. I didn't understand why they didn't have more servers on a Saturday evening during a dinner service. I was a little baffled by that. n nNot sure if this matters, but this place is run by Koreans as is most sushi places in Vegas it seems. Started with the usual, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. The quality was mediocre, it wasn't that bad but it wasn't good either, they weren't really fresh in my opinion. The tamago and masago were okay as well, the tamago was definitely better than any of the fish. The Ikura, well didn't really look like regular Ikura to me, it was much smaller than normal, and the color was a bit off to me, which goes back to the question of freshness, it wasn't really fresh, as it tasted different from what I'm used to and I usually order about 20 pieces of Ikura . What really got me was ordering the sweet shrimp, I nearly gagged on this and really felt nauseous eating it. That's a huge no no for me, they poured Ponzu sauce on it what seemed to me they were trying to mask the age of the fish, it was NOT fresh at all. One friend ordered Uni and well the presentation of it was bad, it looked horrible to say the least, and he was very skeptical of tasting it after my reaction with the sweet shrimp. n nMy friend got the rib eye and pork belly. They weren't bad according to him and for the pork belly though, it was dripping in oil. Like the plate was saturated with it. Looked good at least, but I wouldn't touch it without at least dabbing it down with a napkin. We also got a first kiss roll since it sounded it, it wasn't too bad, but I'm not usually a fan of rolls in general. n nAt the end we ordered dessert, two tempura ice cream and two ice cream, one order per person, and waited close to 15 minutes for it, before we cancelled and just left. I don't know what was going on in the kitchen, but it seemed under staffed all around for a Saturday evening. n nThe only real good thing I would say on the menu is everything else but the nigiri. They have an extensive AYCE menu, but it'll be a very long time before I come back here, if ever. It's worth a try, and I hope the experience of others are better than mine, but I do have high standards for sushi restaurant in general. It's worth a try if you cannot tell the difference in quality or freshness of fish as some of my friends cannot, but if you get easy queasy from bad fish, I would avoid it at least for now.",1
"I heard everyone rave about BMG so I was really excited to go. Only it was very diapointing, I don't pay to see people eat and then in a form throw it up. The sense with the machinary were my favorite. Even though I did expect to see more of the bluemen performing.",1

So if you see an amputee coming into the store next time you visit, you'll know it's me. and you'll know where my limbs went. In fact, I daresay that Anthropologie has hobbled many a shopper with their outrageous prices. n nSo why do I give Anthro four stars? I CAN'T STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! Their home goods are so darn cute. Their clothes are so eclectic and funky. And I am SO too poor for this store. I spend most of my time in Anthro looking at price tags and heaving deep sighs. Oh, how I wish I had more money to spend. Maybe someday.",2
"This particular Panda Express is so gross.I mean, it's clean. However, something is not quite right about the food they serve at this one. Or maybe I just stopped eating Panda Express or it's always been this way and I've been spoiled with delicious Chinese food in SF. It's not fair for me to compare Panda with that, but c'mon! Why does this place charge so much, but provide such low quality food?",1

"I completely agree with October R's 4 19 11 review regarding the general vibe of this place. Very inviting cool concept a blend of ""old world "" attention to deli style comfort food with a modern, slightly edgy sensibility. n nWe tried the Sassano essentially a Reuben , the Fredo a Italian sub , and two ""New World "" pierogies the Southwestern and Buffalo chicken varieties. Not a misstep in any of them. The in house bread, corned beef, and kraut all made the difference. Both pierogies were also outstanding. The Buffalo chicken pierogies were made primarily of white meat, but remained juicy and tender. n nWe also enjoyed samples of both the spinach feta and pepperoni doughbies while we waited. The spinach feta was a bit sweet not quite the flavor profile i was hoping for but the pepperoni doughbie was excellent. Definitely a step up from the omnipresent Pittsburgh pepperoni roll. n nI was also excited to see that a fried egg could be added to any sandwich for a buck.nice touch. n nThe one downside of the place an aspect I might not have noticed if I didn't have so many vegetarian pescatarian friends these days is that almost every item on the menu contains meat. n nNevertheless, although our veggie friends might not be joining us, we'll definitely be going back soon.",2

My favorite the hand made pizza but also all kind of well executed appetizers goat cheese peppadew, mussels white wine with creme sauce, bruschettas.

Overall great food for the money, I greatly recommend.",2

"I'm kicking myself for not checking the reviews before going to the Rainforest Cafe. I thought it'd be a fun place to eat before I took my friend back to the airport to catch her flight. We were seated quickly, which was nice. But one look at the menu and I was already seeing a red flag. 13 for a chicken sandwich! A chicken sandwich! Clearly I was playing for the atmosphere. I finally decided on a pasta dish that the waitress recommended. The place was pretty loud. and pretty dirty. Trash was all over the floor. Who knows? Maybe they had just had a lunch rush before we got there? Either way I was not impressed. My food came out in reasonable time, and it did look good. I wish I could remember what it was called, because I was not impressed by the flavor. At all. The only edible part was the sausage that came with it. I finally got the nerve to tell the manager that it was terrible and sent the dish back to the kitchen. He offered to make me something else, but by that time my friend needed to go back to the airport. The only good thing is they didn't make me pay for it. My friend says the chicken sandwich was okay, but I will never take a friend back there again. Or myself. If you're looking for a rainforest like place that uses mechanical animals to entertain scare the children, go ahead and try it out, but If you're looking for a good meal I suggest finding some place else.",1

"This company is a total rip off, it is affiliated with Swiss Colony,Ginny's, Country Door, Home at Five, Massey's, etc. They claim that one year ago they sent me some product I had never heard of them until I got a bill, I called an told hem I never ordered anything or received anything. I have been a loyal customer of al of the subsidiary companies for years and paid my account in gull on time. Now this company has sent me to collections inspite of numerous calls to a RUDE customer service and crdit department, I sent four letters and filled out their fraud report, which my attorney advised me later on not to do again although they want me to fill out another one as fraud reports can hold up the opening of bank accounts and loans. I cannot irder from the companies I had been dealing with for years, MY holiday as ruined as I could not order my usual treats from Swiss Colony or gifts I wanted from COUnntry Door and Gunny's. They have no pro",1

"Situated near Broughton, Mezz is an ideal place to visit for good food and drink at reasonable prices. I came here with some friends earlier this year, although we weren't really impressed by the ambiance of the place, the service and quality of the food were great. The seafood chowder was some of the best I have ever tasted, with really nice, big chunks of vegetables and fish. This, along with a can of Irn Bru, came to less than u00a34 which was definitely value for money. To add to this, the service was friendly and quick to process and bring our order. nI would certainly recommend Mezz but, as I said earlier, the general mood seems to lack a bit of heart and comfort. Still, it offerrs great food at affordable prices well worth a look.",2

"Tried Diamond based on reviews and am very satisfied and appreciative of fellow yelpers feedback, as I found experience to be as positive as everyone else. The deluxe pedicure really was deluxe, all types of masks, scrubs, creams, truly relaxing and the most thorough pedicure I have had ever. I had the express manicure and also very happy with results. Trinh is the sweet girl that worked on me and she was very detail oriented, took her time, and did a very good job. The environment is calm and the owners pleasant and professional. They addressed me by name many times through out my visit. They don't have fancy chandeliers or dj booth, but they do offer great service. I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a real manicure and pedicure.",2
"Breakfast foods are the best foods and, I'm pleased to report, Taylor's does the genre proud. n nI've dined here twice, both in the morning. Taylor's is located on the NE corner of 44th St and Camelback and, if you want to find it quickly, you should turn into the complex when you see Cork 'N Cleaver. Otherwise, prepare to drive around in circles wondering if the map on Yelp was wrong. It's a little hard to spot at first. n nInside, you'll find a cute little cafe with cute little tables and a cute little patio. It's so cute I could just squeeze it. Seriously though, it feels exactly like a breakfast joint should. n nBut let's get to the good stuff the food. I'm a big fan of morning grub and Taylor's certainly delivers. My first visit, I had a chorizo and egg dish that was perfectly cooked and reasonably priced. More recently, I had the poached eggs with salmon which was a giant mouthful of delicious. If I remember correctly, all the poached egg dishes were priced the same regardless of meat choice, so I had to make it count. n nI did knock off one star for the lackluster service we received on our most recent visit. Still, if you're in the mood for some breakfast eats and the Good Egg sounds about as exciting as a Coldplay mixtape, give Taylor's a try.",2

"This year the holidays were in Arizona and we were in the mood for sushi. While sceptical of sushi in the desert I was encouraged by the Yelp reviews so had to give Toyama a try. n nThe out of the way location and strip mall look did not inspire confidence but if you have traveled enough you will have found many gems in similar locations so we pressed on. n nIt was early and Toyama was just opening apparently its so busy that this is the optimium time so we had our choice of seats and in that scenario we always pick the sushi bar. Mo was on hand and didnt disappoint in his role as host as evidenced by other reviews. He was friendly and informative about the fish, where its sourced and what makes great sushi. Everything we tried was fresh, high quality and executed perfectly. Highly recommended.",2

OMG, seriously good Pho. n nI recently was able to talk my extremely picky husband to try it. I got him to try the spring roll. And he tried a dish with lemongrass and chicken that he was really happy. Score! n nI had the Pho with tofu. I was very happy especially because I wasn't feeling all that great and the Pho was so soothing and delicious . They provided me with copious amounts of lime and mint upon request and I was one happy girl. n nI will admit, I've only ever had the spring rolls and Pho, but I've never been disappointed. n nThe ambiance is surprising, it is in a strip mall. But you walk in to a really airy and comfortable space. The decor is unique and fresh. n nThe staff, other than the owner that ended up helping us, is a little lacking the service skills, but hopefully that will develop with time. I hope they crack the whip on the sitting on the counters by the register, talking on their cell phones, and the lack of attention hence the reason the owner took over, I assume .",2
"First sign of I should have left was no credit card machine. But they do have an ATM they charge you to 2.50 cents to use.

"Sapporo is one of my favorite sushi spots in town. Coming from NYC, I had my fair share of disappointing attempts at finding good sushi, but Sapporo actually has remained on the top of my list for AZ for the 4 years that I have been here. n nAs everyone knows, the crowd is pretentious and the music is too loud. Fine. You can avoid this by going from Sunday Wednesday. The food is great. Their happy hour is pretty good, although they recently raised their pricing 5 for a California roll during Happy Hour?Really? . n nMy favorite rolls include the shrimp tempura roll, Alaskan roll, and sautee roll pricey but worth it to me, at least . I used to adore their mango passion frozen martini until they started to serve them with less alcohol, thereby sacrificing the flavor and worth. The nigiri is great fresh, big portions. The calamari is awesome with an addicting dipping sauce. n nMy advice is to check Sapporo out on their ""off days "" so you can avoid the hustle and bustle of a crowd looking more TO fish than for fish. If you can handle not being able to hear the person with whom you're dining in exchange for really fresh sushi and good drink deals 50 off, plus 75 cents then try it out. I doubt you'll be disappointed.",2

"I have been eating at Armstrong's for many, many years ok so there was that dark period of time when Armstrong's moved out for a few years and it became Calabria's and then Gullifty's . My parents lived right up the street from Caste Village and we would find ourselves at Armstrong's, or ordering off the takeout menu, at least once every other week the ladies who work at the counter still greet my father by name . Nowadays when I go there I wince at how expensive everything on their menu has become, how packed it is there's rarely ever a time when you won't have to wait at least 25 minutes for a table on any night of the week , and how slow the service can be. All of my gripes usually disappear with the arrival of my meal. Their menu features a wide array of salads, pastas, calzones, traditional Italian dishes, and scrod cooked in more ways than you would ever imagine. Last night I ordered the eggplant parm, which had crispy eggplants rounds smothered in marinara and cheese. My dad ordered some kind of hot sausage that was baked in a casserole dish with linguine, marinara sauce and cheese. Basically, this place excels at smothering things with sauce and cheese. It's a favorite of the locals and definitely a must try if you are in the area. Just be prepared for the place to be packed, and try remember as you're standing there with your stomach growling that crowds of people at a restaurant usually means it's good!",2

"So we got a 10 off coupon in the mail.we go for lunch and were warmly greeted and seated immediately. We opted for the lunch special of 1 2 panini and a salad and Calzone with a salad. The pizza prices were outrageous! 24 bucks for a 14 inch pizza? REALLY? the salads were just OK.skimpy on the dressing, with one over ripe cherry tomato. The Panini was tiny and and cut into two pieces. One with ample meat, cheese and peppers. The other had NO peppers, NO meat and was all cheese. The french fries were soggy and over salty. The very nice hostess came over said our coupon was 10 off a 20 total meal, so she suggested a piece of turtle cheesecake, which was very tasty and pushed the total to 21.00.

"I have been a Harley owner for 10 years, and have owned 3 different Harley's. I've frequented several Harley shops trying to find the ones that provide the best and most convenient service. I used to be able to say this about Red Rock Harley, however, over the last six months, I've had nothing but disappointing run in's with Red Rock Harley. In April I had my XR1200 serviced after it had been in storage for several years. I advised Harley Service Dept of that information when I made the appointment, and again, when I brought the Harley in and spoke with the service advisor after waiting 10 15 minutes for an advisor to become available, there are never enough working there to help you in a timely fashion , I made him aware that the bike had been in storage, and it was important for the technicians to do a thorough evaluation of the motorcycle. I was assured that the 5,000 mile service would cover everything that needed to be looked at and that they would make sure that was taken care of. The service cost me 400 and change, which maybe for those that work at Harley don't believe that is a lot of money, or don't bat an eyelash when having customers spend that amount, but I expect to get what I pay for when I dish out that kind of money. When I got the bike back, I assumed I had gotten 400 worth of work done to the bike, not just an oil change. Unfortunately, that seems to be what happened. After waiting 20 minutes to be helped this time, I was told by the technician everything was fine and that my front tire would probably need to be changed before the next service, but should be okay for a while. After getting the bike home I checked the tire pressure on my own, and both tires were at least 5lbs. light from where the manual states they should be, which caused me to wonder what else hadn't been done. A few days later I was riding the bike and it started blowing spots of oil down the side of the bike. I looked to see if I could find the cause and found that the breather hoses were leaking due to dry rot. I was livid. In order to get to the air cleaner, the technician had to have touched the breather tubes, they didn't notice the dry rot?!? What had I paid for, why would I not have been advised? nI decided that I wanted to replace the front tire sooner rather than later because upon my own inspection I was seeing signs of dry rot and didn't want to have a blow out. I did some research and found that Shinko has a good tire for the XR and that a lot of XR owners run them on their bikes. They are also more cost effective than the standard Dunlop's that Harley pushes. With reservation, I contacted Red Rock Harley Service. I was told on the phone that if I brought in the wheel and the new tire they would have no problem switching it out for me. I thanked them and ordered the tire. When the tire came in, I again contacted Red Rock Harley, because I wanted to have an appointment. The person I spoke with in the service department told me there was no need for an appointment if I wasn't bringing the whole bike in, that I could just bring in the wheel and the new tire, they could have it switched out for me, and it would cost me 56. I thought everything was set. July 3rd, I brought the wheel and the new tire into the service department, I stood there waiting around for about 10 minutes, and then when it was time to be helped, the advisor took the wheel and the tire, had me sign a parts waiver. I told him that I would be waiting because it was only supposed to be about a half hour. He stamped the page ""waiting "", and verified that he had the correct contact number. I looked around the store, trying to make sure to give them enough time. After 30 minutes, we hadn't heard anything so I waited a little longer and then I walked over to the Service Area. The advisor was with another customer, but made eye contact a couple of times. I stood around and waited another 15 minutes to be helped, and then was told, ""I'm sorry, we have a new policy where we don't put outside tires on for customers. "" I explained that I had called ahead two times in the last few days to make sure this could be done. All he did was say, ""I'm sorry, we just don't do this. "" He couldn't have gone to the showroom floor, found us, and told us this BEFORE we waited 45 minutes?!?! I was livid. I told him I wanted to speak to the manager, so he called back, and the manager came out. Mike didn't even give me a chance to say anything, he just interrupted and said that they don't put those tires on because he doesn't know where they come from, can't guarantee them, won't warranty them, etc. etc. I wasn't asking for any of the above. Then he said Shinko wasn't a good tire and he's never heard of them. Regardless of any of his excuses, he was disrespectful and did not offer any kind of option or solution, just let us walk out the door. I don't think I will be walking back through it again. And I will make sure that every Harley owner I know in Las Vegas knows.",1
"If I'm going to settle for frozen yogurt over ice cream, I better enjoy it. When I have Golden Spoon, I don't feel like I'm settling. This location is on par with the others. Very clean, with a big variety of flavors and toppings, and a couple of seats for eating in. n nThe prices may seem higher at first glance, but the servers tend to pour very generous portions. They also generously load the toppings in the cup or cone. If you paid 30 to 40 cents an ounce for what Golden Spoon gives you, you'd be paying a whole lot more. n nCall me old fashioned, but I despise the self service frozen yogurt concept. That in itself may be one of the biggest reasons I prefer Golden Spoon to other frozen yogurt places. Not only are most of the flavors better at Golden Spoon, but there tends to be a wider variety and the machines are superior. No super soft runny yogurt here.",2

"I'm probably the biggest foodie ever and I must say, poutine is one of my guilty pleasures. While visiting the land of the great poutine, I decided to save the best for the last. I was told that this place was a must have. I have to say that I was terribly disappointed because the truck stop on Dundas square serves better poutine and doesn't cost 20! I mean, I would have no issue with the price point if it was as spectacular as people say it would be. I ordered the ""pepper sauce "" with spicy sausage and banana peppers.i know right?.sounds delicious on paper for sure but the recommended pepper sauce had peppercorns that were not properly crushed, the cheese curds were massive clumps sitting right in the center away from the sauce, so it didnt even melt properly, and the amount of banana peppers exceeded the amount of fries. I mean I'm sure the recipie isn't hot peppers, cheese curds, gravy and a sprinkle of potatoes now is it? To be honest, I've never written a bad review because I can literally enjoy anything, especially being east indian, my stomach can handle the spice. However the drive back to Toronto was filled with acidity and indigestion. More over, when I asked to take it out in a box, I was handed my package, then asked for it back because the guy in the kitchen ""forgot "" to do something. After handing it back to him, he drops the box, takes it back in the kitchen, does what he needs to and hands it back over to me. After getting in my car and driving off, I start feeling the paper bag leak on my lap! So basically the guy didnt even have the decency to give me a new box after dropping it. I know I should have double checked but hey I thought it is common sense to do that for a customer especially when you slam the box on the floor in front of them! Guess I have high r expectations. oh and I forgot to mention, the guy went to add extra hot peppers! n n The only couple good thing I can say about it were the actual fries, but if you go wrong deep frying potatoes, then there is a problem. The ambiance was also nice and the poutine orders looked delicious from a distance.",1
"My new favorite spot! I've been in search of a great relaxing CenPho Sunday breakfast spot, ever since Palatte closed as I may have mentioned in just about every review lately, sorry . and I think I've finally found it! Oh my gosh the Huevos Rancheros are lovely just the right balance of egg, cheese and salsa, with perfect little slices of advocado too. Yum. I don't eat meat but the kitchen happily left the chorizo out of the Egg Torta this is such a yummy egg sammy! Bowl of granola and yogurt all fresh and chock full of yummyness! They'll serve breakfast items all day if you want and I haven't done it yet but I'm told I could get just your basic eggs cooked anytime I want, too. n nI've also been there quite a few times for other meals. Absolute crave memory formed immediately for the ""eco friendly "" fish tacos. at only 2.50 a piece, I was full with only two of them! I've also tried the ""Elote Callejero "" 5 ""street corn "", I guess? it's amazing perfectly charred corn on the cob, lightly coated with white cotija cheese. Served with a sharp steak knife, carefully slice the kernals off onto the plate and scoop them up yummy! The flavors immediately sent me to this wonderful camping trip, sitting around the fire, pulling food off the outdoor grill. ahhhh! n nPlease go ! It's never been very busy when I've been there and this is a gem, we need to keep it in business!",2

"Visited with my two sisters and daughter and was rather disappointed. Loved the decor and feel of Europe, however we were very disappointed with the quality of the crepes. I've been enjoying crepes for more than 20 years and was taught by a very good friend of mine to make crepes at home French style . We'd seen this restaurant and really were eager to give it a try. Service was pretty slow. Our order was not complete, so we had to ask the server to cancel a soup since we were almost finished out meal. We were told by our server that the chef was giving her a hard time in the kitchen. When we finally went up to pay for our meal, which no one ever came over to tell us that we needed to see the cashier. However, we did not receive a bill. So, we assumed the server was coming back to complete everything. When we signaled to a waiter, he explained that we needed to go to the cashier to pay. Our server was not visible and the cashier explained that she was given the task to help us at the last minute. Too many excuses for shortfalls.",1
"I've been to many TGI Friday's as a single, a couple and a parent with kids. I have to say the staff did not seem to have a clue as to how to deal with parents with kids.

This Friday's, being in a Vegas locals casino, is used to kids so it is not like this was a new experience. n nThat aside, the menu was good as far as selection but only so so in preparation. We went to this one because we knew it was early enough and so the restaurant would be empty. I can't say I would go back.",1

"If this place could be described in four words, they would be n nAngry, Sweaty, Dive y, and DELICIOUS n nThis place is a Pittsburgh classic. Don't go here if your looking for some hip and trendy seafood joint. I'm pretty sure the decor hasn't changed in the past 50 years, but that's part of what makes it awesome. n nThe cashiers and cooks are angry, and slightly scary looking, but not in a bad way if that makes any sense whatsoever . Their no nonsense, ""soup nazi "" style fits with the classic blue collar Pittsburgh motif this place is still holding on to. If you go in knowing what you want, you'll be fine. n nBottom line, and most importantly, the food. Pretty much everything is fried, but it's all good. Never too greasy, and only lightly breaded. When lent rolls around, you always see every restaurant in town with signs boasting, ""Voted Best Fish in Town. "" I'm not sure who's voting, and how EVERY restaurant seems to have the best. Don't be fooled, Oyster House IS the best fried fish in town.",2
Went to this restaurant with my wife and ordered a meal to share. 5 minutes after we started eating the manager came out and said we have to take the plates back because we put a full size meal on them.,1
This is a busy McDonald's. This is one of the bathroom stopping points for travel between Las Vegas and Phoenix. This is a subpar McDonald's. Just ordering a couple simple things like fries and a hamburger for the kids but they messed up the order incomprehensible.,1

If you want to have a night out in Vegas that lacks pretentiousness or the mainstream cheese ball factor then look no further. The drinks were priced about right for Vegas and the Irish band was good. A lot better than the Irish bands I heard when I was in Dublin city 4 months ago. The bartenders on the upper level were top notch and professional.,2

There are usually at least 4 5 people working so the longest I ever have to wait is a few minutes. Great color selection. I don't have a favorite person because they all do a great job. I am super picky and will often ask them to touch up here and there. They are happy to fix anything and some of them are more of a perfectionist than I am!

Christy was running a little late, but the receptionist and Christy apologized twice. She was only 10 minutes late, but I appreciated the acknowledgement. n nI explained what I wanted, and showed Christy some pictures.

"Came here today for a 430 pm reservation to celebrate my husbands birthday.

We both loved it I took a small bite to try He also got the twice baked potato.so good! nI got an end cut prime rib. Very good, but I wish it was not so well done. Server Bryan did warn me on this, but my Aunt told me to order it that way so I did, next time I'll do another cut yes there will be a next time I as well got the twice baked because YUM! nHe got a Guinness and I got the Orange Slice Martini not on menu because it's a favorite well known classic deliciousness! nFor dessert they gave us the mud pie I think it was called. Sooo good. Coffee ice cream on top of an Oreo crust with thinly sliced almonds and drizzled chocolate and caramel sauces! nService is very good there.never had a bad experience. The servers are there when needed and near by when they are not needed I hope that doesn't sound awful a tall young manager came out and spoke to us about our meal too.

Service flat out sucked! Their waitresses were all sitting around or making themselves drinks while we waited to put our orders in for over 10 minutes there were only 3 other groups . When we finally got our food it was undercooked and cold.,1
Just tried the benefit brow bar at ulta! Omg! Amazed! Cheetara is amazing she is super friendly and well educated! Definitely going back in two weeks for a touch up! Thank you cheetara!,2
The portions are small and the food is pretty average overall. This place seems to try too hard to be something they are not. You could get better food at PF Changs and for a better price.,1
"I was treated to a birthday brunch by friends two Sundays ago at Eleven. Since I hadn't eaten at this place for several years, I agreed to go even though I was unimpressed after my last dinner visit and hefty dinner tab. When we arrived for our reservation, the three of us were seated at a large half circle table next to a large party with noisy unmanaged children. I eventually requested another table. We were promptly moved which I appreciated. The waiter then came to the table and appeared to be somewhat hung over. He took our orders including my coffee order. We were then served cold bread and spreads. Hmm.I would have expected better for a high end ""brunch. "" I then asked for a coffee refill but never got it. I later decided to order grapefruit juice but then again never got it. When the waiter finally came back to our table, he said that the food servers sometimes forget to tell him. Way to throw your coworkers under the bus. I then had to ask for more coffee again. The food was acceptable, but portions were quite small for a ""brunch. "" Our tab for three was close to 80. Doesn't seem like much has changed since my last experience there. A hefty bill for marginal service and half empty stomachs. Yowza. I don't think I'll be back again.",1

"If you like lobster, this is the place to come! The lobster roll rocks! I would be giving this place 5 stars, but they changed their menu lately and only have small lobster rolls now.

"I've been a long time customer of this particular location. This used to be my favorite place to take my car, but they're under new managment or something.

"I had a great time at Haze. Beautiful girls dressed to the nines. The promoter we met by chance offered us free entry at 1am and drink tickets since my group comprised of four girls, nice! We all lined up with the others to get in. At this point, it got pretty crowded. The club was PACKED. I didn't even want to venture to the dance floor, and stayed at the bar with a perfect view of the DJ, right behind the VIP tables. I always prefer the lesser clubs to XS and Marquee. n nLaidback Luke was amazing! I drank a little too much and danced so much, giving no fucks to anyone's personal space around me. My friend said that when he dropped trap, we turned 10x dirtier. Aw yeah, we know how to party! Pretentious girls can't hang! Also lots of dudes. I had around 5 10 guys try to hit on me. n nReally nice club architecture wise , the light walls are so nice! Drinks are pricey as always too. The go go dancers are hot, but they are so awkward when they dance and end up standing around half the time. Boo! I can do a better job than that!",2
Wow. What a turn around. This place used to be great. Now it seems like it has turned a corner. All of the games are broken and steal your money. The whole place is now dumpy and unclean. I saw the owner yell at some guy for doing a slap save a pretty normal move in the pinball world. What a psychopath.,1
"First impressions are really important. I try not to make a judgement too quickly, but in this case. nMy appointment time was 10am. They said to check in at 9 30am since I'm a new patient. I arrived and checked in at 9 30am. There were 2 other people in the waiting room. nAt 10 30am, I'm called back for vitals and put in an exam room. nSaid exam room was in desperate need of vacuuming. What appeared to be cracker crumbs were all over the floor. There was a good layer of dust on the desk and the white walls were really dingy. nat 10 45am, someone comes in and introduces himself as a medical student who is helping the dr. Med student takes my history and looks at my chart, then basically tells me that there is no problem and I'll just need to come back to keep an eye on what brought me there in the first place. Mind you, this is a specialist and I've already been referred to them from a primary care because we've been watching and now things are concerning. nSo med student leaves and says dr will be in shortly. n11 15am dr comes in. does the history and chart business. orders tests and affirms that things are concerning. Sends me on my way. nSo i check out, and i ask the front desk girl if the imaging center that the dr has written a referral to is on my insurance. She is seriously bothered by my question. I explained that I don't want to leave there with the referral, call to set things up only to find that they aren't covered, then have to go back to this office for a new referral. Then I set up my follow up appoinment. I honestly ask if being an hour late is normal for them, and if so, I'd like an earlier appointment time so that I don't interfere with my other scheduled things. Front desk girl again is bothered and says ""fine, how's 9am? "" n nI don't think it's too much to ask to have an appointment be on time, especially when they insist you show up early. I also think a dr's office should be clean. And I also think that a dr's office should employ people that have good people skills. n nI'll be finding a new specialist very soon.",1
"What what is all this crazy around these food trucks? What makes a burger truck any better than a chain fast food burger joint? I guess it's the Asian Fusion of the burgers? Or the crowd of kids that hang out in the parking lot making it the ""cool "" thing to do? I don't know, but I had to go see. n nIt wasn't smart of me to go to Serendipity for a huge sundae before hitting up a food truck though. note to self n nOkay, so its Westside Wednesdays! So we found the truck parked in front of the RedHand Tattoo joint. 6 burgers to choose from.and some typical asian snacks. Me and the bf go for the 2 something about an overeasy egg in a burger makes things better and a 5. a spicy habanero burger. Also saw a flyer for some garlic fries and strawberry lemonade. I'm sold! So the 4 items came to 14. Good deal! Wanted to leave a tip forthe jelly, but I don't like that jelly stuff. Next time.! Just so they can all shout ""tip jelly! "" n nSo stood there a couple minutes and we got our food. Walked back to our car to enjoy the new discoveries. It was a bit messy. but finger licking goodness! n nThe verdict on the food itself? YUMM! Well, one thing that bugged me was the bun. It seemed like a super cheapy store bought massive quantity burger bun. But I didn't expect much. The burgers themselves though, were awesome! The blend of flavors worked so well. I preferred the 2 over the 5 can't remember the names, but there's a photo of the menu somewhere here. . The dip for the garlic fries was good, and the seasoning on the fries were good. Didn't care for the lemonade though, somewhat tart and kinda watery. n nSo this marks the beginning of the food truck journey for me. Maybe I will return to Fuku Burger, but not til I have tried them all!",2
We were looking for some light and healthier options late in the afternoon.so we went into this cafe. n nI wish we hadn't.the couscous was awful and apparently not fresh. We initially inquired as to when it was prepared and the server said yesterday or earlier today.we returned the full plate to the counter and ended in a conversation with the proprietor. He told us he had it for breakfast and it was fresh prepared today.well if it made earlier in the am it was made with old ingredients! n nBegrudgingly he offered a refund or another option.the best thing we did was pay the bill and leave. n nStay away.,1
"This shop is absolutely amazing! I was having car trouble and took my Toyota to the local Toyota dealership, they wanted to charge me over 1000 for an oil leak i wasn't even sure there was a leak to begin with . In a panic I searched for a reputable shop where I could take my car to get a second opinion. n nOne of the owners, Mark, answered the phone and explained how Yota Pro's could help me. they said they would look at my car for free and if there turned out to be a leak they could get me in right away for fix it. Took my car into them the next day and they were able to confirm there was a leak and they could do it for considerably less! Mark even brought me into the garage where my car was lifted and let me see the leak with my own eyes. n nI was so impressed this shop. They made me feel reassured that they were giving me the best quote possible and we not trying to rip me off. They had my car done within a day and even drove me to a rental car place so I could rent a car while mine was being serviced. n nThis is a family fun business and their mechanics are Toyota trained and work on other cars too best of all, they work hard to give you the best price possibly and don't leave you feeling screwed over. n nI will be bringing my car back here from now on. Thank you Yota Pro's for treating me so kindly and fixing my car. You guys rock!",2
"My dining experience at T.G.I. Friday's started out exceptional. There was absolutely no wait which I found odd for a Saturday night . The staff sat us in a booth which was preferable due to us having four children . And our server was amazing and attentive. n nAs excellent as everything was up to this point it saddens me to say that the food itself was.off. My cheeseburger was under cooked. My son couldn't finish his kid's cheeseburger saying ""every time I take a bite I feel like I'm going to throw up. "" And my wife said something with her Parmesan crusted flounder tasted weird. She said she couldn't determine if it was the fish itself or the breading but considering how sick it's made her already I'm assuming it was the fish itself. n nThe rating I'm giving this experience is driven primarily on the quality of the food. When the food itself has your family feeling sick afterward it isn't a good thing. I may come back someday, but it probably won't be anytime in the near future.",1
"I've dined here on business three times in as many months. I will not be coming back. The steaks were fine, but at this price point they should be outstanding. Service was acceptable but again definitely not the level of professionalism that you would expect in this range. On multiple occasions the waiter would insert himself into our conversation with comments regarding our topic. Final insult if you give them your email address to confirm your reservation they will spam you.",1
I didn't eat here but I did indulge in the roof top bar! Good beer and a lovely view of Pittsburgh! Good times!,2
"Our first night in Edinburgh and we decide to drop into the closest restaurant, which happens to feature Portuguese food. Expecting something that would feature a lot of seafood, we were surprised to see that the major feature was chicken. But we ordered a hummus starter, a bean side dish and a couscous salad with peri peri chicken and a couple of beers. It was all very very tasty and just what we wanted for a light meal. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that Nando's was a chain restaurant with 250 outlets in the UK. This was without doubt the best fast food chain dining experience I have had. n nThe routine is different. Someone shows you to a table, presents a menu, but then explains that you have to go to the counter to order and pay and fetch your own cutlery. So it's not the fine food dining experience, but I have to say that the quality and taste of the food was a big surprise. For what it Is I give it four stars.",2
"Wanting to try this for awhile, when our friends from Raleigh came in town they wanted us to take them out. What better thing than to try a new place? We party of six put our name on the list at 6 and by 7, we had a table. TAKE NOTE if you don't want to wait at least an hour here be there when they open! It's a gem on Montford and people know Good Food has Good Food! We had a phenomenal server and the food experience was to die for. Honestly, we ordered almost everything on the menu, including all three seasonal desserts and everything was perfection on a plate. My top favorites were the steamed mussels, the steamed bun never had anything quite like this! , and the desserts. I loved, loved, loved the small plates experience with a large group because we each tried everything that came out. The food comes out as it's prepared so it's hot and fresh and it's like a new surprise for your palate! I can't wait to go back!",2

"My mom and I were on a weekend trip to the Burgh, and wanted a seafood experience, so we decided to give Joe's Crab Shack a try. We put our names in at the front door as there was about a 15 30 minute wait. We walked around Station Square enjoying the fountain show and the music. When we were seated outside, we were thrilled at the atmosphere, picnic tables, lots of elbow room, buckets of silverware and napikins, buckets for shells and crablegs. Our waitress took our drink orders and we read over the menu. Our drinks came back really fast, a Pina Colada for my mom, and a Sangria for me. We both ordred Steampots of Crab! Talk about fantastic! I got Joes Classic, with crab, shrimp and sausage, potatoes and corn. My mom got one with three different types of crab in it. We laughed and ate, and laughed some more. This was one my best restaurant experiences.",2
"Worst parking lot in Pittsburgh. Bring popcorn to watch middle aged, self important mouth breathers gun their BMWs at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots .If one didn't know better, one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent, outdoor performance art installation allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one . Snotty clientele, over priced prepared items, no longer have a monopoly on ANY product in Pittsburgh. That being said, they do have a great selection of produce, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but you'll pay dearly for it. 1 very large, organic, honeycrisp apple you ask? Try 5, for real.

"OK OK Let me explain. I had a hard time NOT giving this place 5 stars. There were errors here and there that could have been taken care of and avoided but at the same time, it was all made ""right "" at the end. So, I really don't have any complaints. n nI was out here during the week of the 2012 Presidential election. The strip wasn't real packed. So, it was the perfect time to be visiting. With all the buzz about the election and the electoral votes, etc, my family and I had our eyes peeled with every TV screen we passed by. The most unfortunate thing was that our room was one of the ones that had been remodeled but in doing so, we weren't ever given the proper remote for the TV and we also weren't given a remote with a guide button that worked. Without a guide button, we also didn't know what channels we had access to or not. Boo! So that was one problem. I asked the front desk about the TV. They said that they would send someone to bring us a replacement remote. I waited for 3 hours. THat didn't happen. I asked again when I was leaving the hotel, for someone to please leave us that remote in our room while we were out. That didn't happen. I finally turned on the TV, well tried to, but it was out. Apparently there was a casino wide surge and tons of poker machines out on the gambling floor weren't working, the computers at the front desk weren't working and the TV's were not working. Oh joy! n nAnother problem for us was that when we had house keeping come, we were going through tissues in our room like crazy. I was suffering from crazy allergies and so was my auntie. When the housekeeping staff came, we never had our tissue supply replenished. So, I had to ask that housekeeping come to our room at 3AM when we had run out of tissue as well as toilet paper. That was issue number two. Again, keep in mind that all it took was a phone call and it was fixed. It was nice that I received what I'd asked for in about 10 minutes after making the phone call, not an hour or two. n nThe last issue was that some of our electrical outlets were not working. That was a bummer when we had cell phones and iPads to plug in and charge. n nThe hotel is on the strip, very close to the sign that welcomes you into Las Vegas. It's connected, via bridge, to the MGM. So, that was a nice stroll between the properties. The minute you walk in, it smells like cocoa butter and coconut. I like the smell but I'm sure there are plenty who are not fond of that scent. Our room was just as I had asked, 2 beds, near an elevator and on a lower level floor. I didn't want to get stuck in a hotel elevator with 45678943 other people who were coming and going in between each and every floor. I also had been given a pool view. That was nice, until I noticed that there was a guy outside my window after I'd come out of the bathroom from having taken a shower. I sure hope it was tinted. I called the front desk right away and asked who and why he was out there. I think he and I both kinda startled each other. Luckily, I had my towel wrapped around me but sheesh. The desk told me that he was putting up some new banners and they should have let the guests know but weren't sure that they'd done it or not. Umm, OK great but do something about him! They got him away from my window immediately. THanks! n nThe rooms are spacious and are pretty clean. I do it at every hotel, checked for bugs and bed mites and things. All clear! The shower was nice and large. But, with as big a tub as we had, I had hoped that we'd received a stopper for our drain so that we could take a bath if we'd chosen to do so. I didn't mention this until the end of my stay. n nI stayed at the Trop for about one week. I got to know the ladies who cleaned my room. After the first time I met them, I asked them for a few things and that they make sure that certain items were always well stocked. After that, it went smoothly and perfectly. Occasionally, I would leave them a drink or snack with their tip. So, I'd say that we had a pretty good relationship for that week. n nThe decor is simple and on the more tropical side. The sundries store clerks are fabulous charming and very friendly. The beach cafe was perfect when I was craving a simple turkey sandwich. The prices weren't bad either. n nThe five stars comes from my not having to pay my resort fees, for the service that I received from the staff, for the assistance I received from the concierge and for the value of my money. I'd definitely stay here again if given the opportunity. n nI was lucky enough to book my one week's stay for under two hundred bucks. So, if I am lucky enough to find a similar promotion again, I'd stay here without any hesitation. THANKS!",2
"I had low expectations for this place. I live nearby but took me years to try it. Let's face it, it's a Korean restaurant in North Las Vegas!

"Food is decent but management attitude is atrocious. They feel they are doing you a favor by allowing you to eat here.

They haven't known the answers to some questions, have sent me on a merry chase, have charged me for three nuva rings when they only gave me one.need I go on? n nAs soon as this last prescription they've messed up without telling me that I'm waiting for comes in, I'll be switching pharmacies. I should have done it months ago. Ugh.",1
"What a terrific experience! Be warned that you will not get full eating here, but the flavor of the food is phenomenal, and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. They didn't have the sea urchin when I ate there, but the beef with wasabi, pork cheek, and Enoki mushrooms were amazing. This was a dining experience unlike any I've had before. You must have a reservation!",2
"Drove by this place made a note to check it out. Stopped to see what everyone on Yelp thought and that sealed the deal. n nSo many options, endless combinations, and a very friendly staff. The food was delicious and I will definitely be heading back to sample some more. What a bargain. I opted for the ""plate "" which comes with 2 proteins, 2 veggies, 1 salad, toppers, and a sauce, oh! and hummus. I wound up with chicken, beef, roasted veggies, the kale, chopped salad, hummus, olives, pickles, pita, garlic aioli, and a pita for under 10!",2
"As I feel that over the years the quality of most Sears locations has extremely deteriorated, I feel that this location deserves a good review. I don't shop here very often but every once in a while I find myself stopping by an aisle on my way to the Sears parking lot. Today I was in need of a basic polo without a logo for an upcoming event. Apparently no one makes un branded, basic women's Polo's anymore and I never got the memo. Anyhow after about four stores and no luck I headed into Sears on a whim. I found a table with nicely folded basic Polo's, exactly what I was looking for. I headed into a dressing room which was clean and it was a bit aged but at least it wasn't full of discarded tried on clothing like many other mall fitting rooms. n nI made my way to the check out and the gentleman behind the counter was very nice and seemed to have an interest in customer service. He folded my Polo's very nicely before putting them in the bag instead of just crumpling them up and throwing them in. He did ask the standard Sears card, membership and other questions but at the end of the day he is just doing his job and after working in customer service I respect that he can still ask those questions with a smile. I had a good experience here today. Sears is sometimes underrated and I have had bad experiences at other locations but they have decent merchandise at fair prices. n nGive this Sears a shot. I can't guarantee you'll leave happy as I did but you might find you get better customer service than you thought you would.",2
"One of the worst ""high end "" steak places we've ever been. We had to send the steak back three times and it still wasn't right. We got the stone crab claws as an appetizer which were just okay but for 60 for a few tiny claws, it wasn't worth it. I had the seared scallops which were dry and not flavorful. Even the brussell sprouts were every dry and unflavorful. This place really misses the mark!",1
"Never. Again. n nAbout twenty of us were here for dinner last night. It took a while for all of us to arrive, and when they took our orders, I was one of the last people at the end of the table to order. I asked for a barbecue chicken pizza, no special crust or anything. n nA while later, they started to bring our orders out. It probably took close to 10 minutes with all the people, starting with the opposite end of the table. After they got down to my end of the table and got everybody else their orders, I was still waiting for mine. A few minutes later, I asked the server what happened to my order. She went to the kitchen to check, and apparently they didn't start it. OK, I guess. Everybody else is already eating, but I can wait a while longer because they may have missed my order. n nMy friend had ordered the same pizza, but with a gluten free crust. She offered to trade me a piece now for one of mine later, and I gratefully accepted. At least five minutes later, the server brought out a pizza. But I realized that it was gluten free, not the standard crust. This second mistake was absolutely not acceptable. n nYes, they did finally get my order correct on the 3rd try. But at this point, everybody else had either finished or almost finished eating, and I upset and embarrassed that I had yet to start. The pizza didn't taste as good to me as it might have tasted normally, although I found the slice from my friend to be just average anyway. On top of this, all I got was an apology from the server, not an apology from the manager and definitely not some sort of coupon or discount to make it up to me. That would have saved them at least another star on this review. n nMoral of the story Do not take your large group here. Maybe one companion or a small group is fine, but look somewhere else if you want to make a large group happy. n nIt's a real shame. I wanted to try their duck tacos during happy hour some time, but it's not going to happen now.",1
"Tyber Creek is a great place to drink, and is one of my favorite places to throw back a cold brew. They have 2 Guinness drafts every single day, so bear that in mind. They are also within bike riding distance from y house, so i love to just ride my beach cruiser up there drink a couple of Guinness and pedal home. It has a true Irish pub feel with 3 different atmospheres. 1st there's the outside, perfect for most of the temperate climate in Charlotte, and on weekends they tend to have live music outside.2ND there's the first floor inside which is dark and very Irish pub like . And 3rd there is the top level where they have live music and DJ's on occasion and mostly its just a more lively place to hang out than the 1st floor, they do have a pool table, its a little crooked and stained, but hey its only 50 cents to play. Thursdays, like are 2 draft night where everything on draft is 2, but bear in mind this is one of their busiest nights and you will most likely have to deal with the type of crowds Erin K. warns about, but if you're like me, that is no problem, 2 beer is good all day every day. Tyber creek has a great great atmosphere and 2 Guinness pints everyday, beat that.",2
"Use the bathroom BEFORE you eat. I guarantee you will never eat there again! It's disgusting and looks like it's never cleaned. This goes for other areas of the restaurant as well. If you're unfortunately seated near the front blinds, don't look at the greasy filth on them. I'll never eat here again and have turned all my chinese buffet friends off to it. I'm told you about your bathrooms several times . CLEAN UP YOUR ACT Hunan VIII.",1
"is this the only place in vegas that has banh mi? i love banh mi.so i love hue thai! i usually order the charbroiled beef banh mi.i've also tried the cold cut sandwich, but the special banh mi at mr. baguette in rosemead, california is a lot better. hue thai also has a huge selection of drinks.slushies, boba, etc.",2
Roadtrip from MN to Cincinnati and this was our overnight. It was clean although the room had a musty stale smell and damp carpet. It served it's purporse for a place to crash. The morning coffee was terrible and we stopped at a coffee shop in Danville to dump it and get good stuff. nThe staff feeds the squirrels and they're friendly. nConstruction is going on and lots of storage containers in the parking lots.,1
"I wish I could give this place less than 1 star. What a horrible experience! n nI was part of a larger group and although our experience was bad, we didn't bother asking for a manager because when the couple next to us politely did so, the manager came to the table and was VERY rude to them. She even went so far as to use racial slurs and call the lady the ""C "" word! After that, the manager followed the customers to the front door where she continued to harass them. n nIt's bad enough when your food service sucks but to treat any customer that way is inexcusable. n nNot a chance on earth we will ever return to this God awful place.",1
"This place is absolutely outstanding. nFrom their cocktails to their extensive and well curated wine list, to, of course, the food. The presentation and preparation are both exquisitely cared for. I've never had something that didn't surprise and impress me. It is consistently excellent. nBe prepared for rich though. Sweet breads, bone marrow, duck egg, venison tartar, are good examples of the kinds of items you'll find on the menu. Even the vegetables are likely to be confit! This pleases me immensely but it isn't the place for you if you're looking for a light salad. n nOrder a few dishes and share. This is definitely the best way to go. The plates are a little small, but with how rich they are you won't want bigger. The best is to be able to try a few things and really get a feel for the kitchen's style and skill. n nan important word of advice Do not skip dessert. the panna cotta always blows us away and my partner is generally not a fan n nThe servers are knowledgeable and attentive and always so sweet. The ambiance is relaxed and refined at the same time.",2
"The service was adequate, and menu choices were a little more than a little overpriced. I ordered the street style pork sandwich, the pork was pretty much the equivalent of a blue rare. The sandwich was the size of a small biscuit, and depressingly unfilling. Before this, i had ordered a pork taco with green salsa forgot name, sorry, this review is written in retrospect , and the pork was well cooked, except that the taco was soggy as a result of the pork grease. My friend had dim sum, so size wasn't much of a problem for her, she did say though, the dim sum had an off putting oder, but tasted fine. Overall, the place was sub par and I wouldn't go here again. Another note The drinks offered there are served in bottles, which means no free refills. Just know that these bottles are the size of a soda can, and depending on what you order, you may or may not be getting less than your money's worth or even less still , as some of the bottles are smaller than others. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, overpriced and the food is repulsive.",1
"Not at all impressed. Food is mediocre at best. No salsa bar. Ordered carne asada tacos, tortilla soup Maui onion rings. nAll MEH. Tacos were not fresh tasting, meat was bland, onion rings were greasy and tortilla soup was ok. nBeing a fan of Cafe Rio and Baja Fresh, this place pales in comparison. Such a shame that it occupies such a great space in this mall.",1
"Oh Golden Steer, I totally have a crush on you! n nThe Golden Steer is such a throwback to Old School Vegas. When you walk through the front door, you are transported back to the 1950s. Back in the 50s and 60s, this was THE place to go for a great steak dinner. When you are eating, you keep looking over your shoulder to see if Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr. had just walked in. It is just way too cool in my book. n nSo back in the old days of Vegas, all of the Vegas Elite came here and had their own table. If you were anyone, you had a table with your name on it saving your seat. This is one of the cool leftovers from that era still in the restaurant. You can request to sit at Elvis', Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin my favorite Rat Packer, oh Dean o I love you! , and numerous other celebrity tables. My mom is the biggest Elvis fan in the world, so when I took her here for her birthday last year and got the Elvis table, she almost cried. It is fun to have something fun in common with a superstar from yesteryear, in if it is just sitting at the same table at a great restaurant. n nOn top of the coolness factor, the steaks speak for themselves too. I mean when the smallest steak on the menu is 12oz, you know you are in for a feast! Last time I was here, i ordered the Prime Rib and it came out on its own plate because there was no room for anything else on the plate. The Prime Rib was even hanging over the side in more than one place. I only made a small dent in it and ended up taking it home and it turned into 2 more meals at home. Now that is some serious MEAT. Yum and drool all at the same time. n nAnother awesome aspect of this restaurant is the table side service for the desserts. This is one of the only places left in the world that does flaming Cherries Jubilee and Bananas Fosters at your table, flames and all. It is such a fun time watching your server make your dessert right there for you. And seriously, how doesn't like desserts on fire right in front of you? n nMy absolute favorite part of this place is if you can go on a slow night when the owner is on property. The owner is this very nice lady who will make friends with you as soon as she meets you. I have been several times and she will always come by and just sit down with us at the table. She will tell you all sorts of stories about interesting things that has happened at the place. There are even some ghost stories about the place. And yes, weird stuff still happens there. BOO! Now that is a fun dinner to have, steaks and ghosts! n nSo if you want to experience Old Vegas, eat a huge steak, have a flaming dessert, and maybe get spooked by a spook, this is your joint. Go check it out and support a local legend.",2
"My family and I were looking for a place to eat after visiting the zoo and found Gino's by accident it was a very pleasant surprise. The service was slow but very friendly, and it was completely worth the wait. The cheese lover's pizza was steaming hot and delicious with soft, fluffy crust. The cheese fries took the longest to come out, but it was understandable as they were fresh cut and firm without being goopy or burned. My family also ordered different hoagies and buffalo fries and loved them. If we're in town again, we are definitely stopping at Gino's.",2
"I had a flight booked for me to go to training for a new job.When I learned that I would be flying US Airways I was not thrilled in the least. I've flown US Air a few times, some personal including my honeymoon and twice for business. n nFor this trip I checked in online and had boarding passes sent to my phone. I don't check bags with US Air more on this later , and I wanted nothing to do with their ""customer service staff "". With me I had a carry on suitcase and a garment bag. As I boarded the first flight, I asked if they could hang my garment bag for me. Every airline I've ever traveled on has a place in the front to hang a bag like this. Not US Air. The lady said ""are you in 1st class? "" I said no. ""Well if you're not in first class, we won't hang it for you. You'll need to put it under your seat because this is a full flight. "" OK.No worries, as I love a wrinkly suit. Other than that there wasn't much notable about the flight. Side note if you have a smart phone, you should 100 do mobile tickets every time you fly.Life changing. n nRewind a few years, to two really awful experiences. First, we flew US Airways to Jamaica from Portland, OR in August of 2008. This was the height of terrible fuel prices and a recession, and US Air wouldn't let you forget it. 30 per checked bag, and they were charging 2.00 for sodas on the plane. TWO DOLLARS FOR A SODA? I'm paying out the ass for a ticket and my bags, and you're going to charge me 2 for what should be a free Sprite? I went thirsty in silent protest of such horrible business practices. n nIn addition, a couple years ago I flew US Air on business and they lost my bag on the return flight. I returned late on a Friday night and didn't have my bag until Sunday.The service at the airport and over the phone was really atrocious. I know that lost baggage people have the worst jobs on earth, but there wasn't even a hint of compassion or ""hey sorry we messed up "". That's why I'll never check bags with them again, and also because I don't trust them to keep my belongings safe. n nI will never, ever voluntarily fly US Air. I'll happily pay more just to avoid them. Do not recommend.",1
"Our go to place for Chinese. Pleasant atmosphere, welcoming staff, and great food. The moo goo gai pan is outstanding. The fried tofu is really good! Portion sizes are large. And the sushi is consistently very, very fresh and good.",2
"Well all that hype. n nWent to Linq last night because of all the hype and also a friend visiting from San Francisco. Much a do about nothing. my friend is staying at Vdara. the views from her room is far more superior than the views offered by Linq. The first half of the ride you are amidst tall buildings, and once you clear the surrounding buildings, you really can't see much of the strip, Good view for the flat lands of Las Vegas, and that's it. n nI have to agree with another reviewer, the drinkers get rowdy and loud, in the pods. no way of knowing who you are going to be paired with for the next 20 mins. heck they even encourage it as they have a bar just before you get on. n nTraffic coordination is very poor. when you come off, there is a limited room on the exit side of the pod. and of course if you get behind some guy who is inebriated or doesn't move out of the way, it can become a hassle. Then you go down an escalator to the gift shop, and the lines for their cash registers backs up to people getting off the escalator. yes pure genius. n nAlso very difficult to find. signs are limited. n nlike I said. much a do about nothing.",1
I always here good things about Chinese places and they're always false. Not this one! This place is the best in phx. The egg rolls are sooooo good.,2
"So there are a million hotels in Vegas obviously, but this one is what we chose. We made reservations in the west tower for a king bed. Well when we arrived, all king bed rooms were taken. So instead of giving us some BS, dude instantly suggested he would upgrade us to a deluxe room for free. Uhhhj, YEA! nWe had a lot of luggage so we used bell service. Dude made small talk with us, and asked where we are from. We said Okinawa. He goes oh cool, I was stationed at Camp Schwab a tiny marine base that you'd only know if you'd actually been there so he wasn't lying . I was like wow no way what a small world. nIt's only the first night but so far everything is working out great! Dude being at Schwab, free room upgrade, decent restaurant etc. Worth a 4 star. For us anyways. Of course if you're willing to , vegas has better places but call it luck, we are getting great service and a great deal! Dude even thanked me for my service. And after hitting my 15th year in the army this year, I gotta say I never get tired of genuine Americans genuinely thanking me. Means a lot. Circus circus will definitely get my business again.",2
So slow. One cashier and 5 customers!,1
We ate here before going to see the Sharks Coyotes game in March. It was busy most likely because of the biker rally and the hockey game but we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered a chicken ceasar salad which was very boring and run of the mill. I actually didn't eat the chicken at all just because there wasn't any flavoring on it and it was cold chicken. Perhaps if it was warm it would have been palatable. nAbout halfway through the meal I started to feel incredibly sick and started to get a headache. I realized once we were done that a lightbulb high on the ceiling right above our table was flickering and it made me sick. I did not bring my migraine medication with me to dinner and was forced to sit through a hockey game with a terrible upset stomach and migraine. Needless to say it pretty much ruined the game. nI would hope that the management would take better care of the building.,1
"I went here yesterday with my boyfriend and this is the place to go for your katsu cravings! This place is so homey, the staff gave AMAZING service, and the food was satisfying! n nOur waitress was SUPER friendly and since it was our first time, she helped us with our choices and recommended some appetizers. We picked the Japanese sausages, which was very yummy and juicy! I ordered the shrimp and salmon katsu which came with rice and miso soup All of the main course meals comes with miso soup . I'm a shrimp lover so I had to get the shrimp katsu which I love! The salmon katsu was OK to me, I Iiked it but didn't love it, it was a bit salty for me. Next time I'll order just the shrimp katsu for sure. My boyfriend picked the Katsu curry, the curry sauce tasted like any other curry I had but the chicken katsu is what makes it oh so delicious crispy goodness! The portions were very generous and fulfilling. I definitely recommend this place if you're a Japanese food lover! You wont be disappointed. ",2
"Honestly, the yogurt flavors were not that great. The employees were not friendly when I let them know a machine was out of yogurt. The fruit was old and brown. The kiwi wasn't rip, and the mochi was stale. I am not happy and will never go back!",1
We were not impressed. Growing up in Cali did spoil us on good Mexican food. Tony's was just ok.,1
"It's such a shame really. I used to enjoy going to Howies Restaurant, enjoying there changing menu but I have to say that when I went last week I was quite disappointed with it all really. n nI should have known that it was going to be less then a great evening when we ended up seated next to the doors to the toilets, surely it would make sense to screen this off or have a whole other door to the them as the last thing either myself or my dinning companions wanted to see while we were eating was the loos, kinda puts you off of your meal a little bit. n nThey also had everyone squeezed into the same side of the restaurant for some reason, so we were left having to scoot our table even closer to the loos when the table next to us was filled and there was little room left to maneuverer on one side of the table. n nHaving received a bowl of bread with not quite enough in it to evenly share out and even less butter we all ordered from what looked like a rather good menu. n nI went for their tomato and crab soup which tasted mostly of pepper and was served so hot that my bowl was still steaming when the other people in my party had long finished their starters and i was left trying to conquer my molten soup alone. I have to say I was very disappointed by the soup as i love fresh crab but feel that it's sweet flavor was just lost. n nMy hope was now resting on my main of pan fried tuna, but again I have to say I was already concerned as when i had ordered it i had asked if it came still pink in the middle, which I have to say is one of the best ways to have a lovely fresh piece of tuna, but the waitress looked at me like i was speaking another language. So when it arrived it was safe to say it was very much cooked all the way though, but to my surprise that wasn't what shocked me the most. What really got me was the fact that it had a huge piece of bone in it. Now I have eaten tuna, a lot, in various places and I have never ever been served a piece with a huge bit of bone hanging of one end of it, in fact it looked more like a pork chop. It's saving grace was that it actually tasted alright and wasn't as dried out as it looked. n nAll my hope in a nice dish was gone by this stage and the pudding didn't fail to disappoint either as i was promised a chocolate and cherry fudge tart, but the cherries must have been misplaced some where as, while the chocolate was lovely and not too rich, there was not a hint of cherry in the dish at all. And strangely it was accompanied by a raspberry compote, is it too much to wonder why they didn't do a cherry one? Perhaps that would have helped to draw out the flavor of the cherries that where hiding somewhere in all that chocolate. n nI just feel that maybe Howies have become a little complacent, I do remember having fantastic meals there and the service was good enough to match. Maybe they need to do something to reinvent themselves, they certainly need to find themselves someone who can fillet fish properly. n nHowies is definitely somewhere that I will not be in any hurry to go back and visit, there are just so many other places that do what they try to do so much better.",1
"The food is good, but not any better than the Med Grill nearby. The desserts are great, but not any better than Gullifty's, around the corner on Murray. The vegetarian options are great to see. n nBut instead of three or four stars, it's a strong two. I've been there three times, and each time, this has been the slowest restaurant I've been to in the entire city. n nMy guess at why they always look busy is that everyone's been stuck there for two hours, and that tends to keep it full. If someone convinces me they fixed the problem with the speed, I'd gladly head back, but until then, they've burned through my goodwill.",1
Love this restaurant. Great service and authentic German food tastes sooooo good. n nRecommend that you order the Zigeuner snitchel.Finish dinner with some Apfelkorn. Yummy! n nSummer hours are a little weird so you may want to check ahead of time to see if they are open but trust me the food is totally worth it.This place has been around for a zillion years and for good reason.,2
"The food is delish, but the service is so SLOW and not good. Also, the dining room is filthy! Dirty tables, disgusting floors, dead flies in the window seals. It wouldn't surprise me if the restaurant ended up on dirty dining. It's ashame because the food is very, very good.",1
"My boyfriend and I went to Kennedy's for dinner tonight had never been there before and was looking forward to checking it out. The food was good Had the Cheese fondue, sausage and pepper flatbread, and chocolate fondue for dessert. Too bad the service was terrible! We saw our waiter twice the entire time we were there and luckily the bussboys food servers were there otherwise we would have gotten no service keep in mind the restaurant was slow not even half occupied . Needless to say I don't plan on going back.",1
I love the BBQ Ranch with chicken! Drive thru place with amazing salads? I'm there! This place is a gem!,2
"The sushi here is pretty good. We tried the Grand Canyon roll, Naked Girl, shrimp tempura sushi, Lisa Lisa roll and salmon skin salad. I wasn't too crazy about the salad and the baked sushi roll does melt in your mouth. The waitress was very attentive, we also sat near the window with a great Strip view. They also had 3 rolls and beer for 21. This was just today during Happy Hour and I would tell my friends to try this place!",2
"This store is in the old Churches building close to home on the SE corner of Power and McDowell. Had a breakfast bacon burrito this morning and had good service through the drive through. I added potatoes to the burrito but it stilled lacked flavor did have a lot of bacon in it and that didn't help either . I added two of the hot sauces and it was enough. This location has been open for about 2 years now, seems steady busy. Food and a drink for 7, wasn't worth it. Had no taste.",1
"NEVER coming here again. Wasted 35 dollars on a really crappy car wash. It was greasy, they missed a lot of obvious spots, Especially the front of my car. Definitely not ""full service. "" They even left their rag on my car after they said its finished. I didn't even get notified after they were supposedly done and on top of that, watched the guys just stand there and hang out. We had to come up to them and ask if the car is finished, Worst experience, if I can give them no stars, I would.",1
"I'm always a fan of a locally owned place, especially a whiskey place. I went to an event here and the people who own this place certainly know how throw a event. There was plenty of space in their location. There were different meats and cheeses and other 'snacks'. There was a special menu of drinks for the even, made with their whiskey of course. You could even do a 'flight' of whiskey if your heart desires. Every drink that I had was delicious and it helps that the owners are very friendly and attentive. I would certainly love to attend another event here any day.",2
"Food mediocre, service equally mediocre and bartender is on some I wish i were somewhere else powertrip. Other then the regular following which manages to sustain them but no one said scottsdale has a discernible palate for food or service , haven't met anyone who would return a second time.",1
I use this car wash frequently however lately they haven't done such a great job. Paid for a deluxe wash and got basic instead. Might have to find another car wash.,1
"Location, location, location. Great building, easy to find, and conveniently close to my favorite downtown venue The Lost Leaf! n nWhat a nice surprise Happy Hour prices until 6pm on TAPAS that's a fancy word for cute little plates of a variety of dishes . Nice to try a variety and not commit to a big plate of one thing! n nGood service, salmon salad was fresh and generous without being ridiculous. Veggies were fresh, salmon was grilled perfectly and very fresh. n nWORTH the drive downtown.",2
If I could give them no stars I would. Absolutely the WORST customer service ever. Jennifer finds herself leaving messages then doesn't allow you to speak about what it was she said. There are always added hidden fees from changing cars to even address changes. I was a long time client if theirs but not after today. If rather pay a little more than be treated as if they don't care about their clients. Certainly will be telling people never to use State Farm and if they still choose to I would make sure they used any other agent but this office. WORST EVER!,1
"It was Hockey Night in Canada, and I wanted to catch Game 5 of the finals, preferably while having a drink and grabbing a bite to eat. So, joined by one of the docs who happens to be Canadian, a hockey fan, and who was craving a burger I arrived at M brgr. n nI had only heard that it's an upscale hamburger joint. Looking at the menu posted outside, it seemed that the food was typical American diner fare, but fancier. And from the outside, we could see the TVs in the bar were already tuned to the game, so we entered. n nThe inside was decidedly hip and contemporary the antithesis of the kitschy eateries that first spawned diner food. J. and I seated ourselves at the bar, ordered drinks and then settled in to peruse the huge menu. This is one of those burger places where you can make all the choices you want type of patty, bun, cheese, and toppings. In fact, the only thing you can't choose is how to have your burger cooked. The restaurant is required to cook all burgers to a basic medium, so my standard medium rare was out of the question. n nWhat with all the distractions of the game and our drinks J. had a martini and I had a Mystique apple cider , it took a while for us to order. In the end we both got the Country Natural Beef Burger, with the beef Food Alliance certified from Prairie Heritage Producers, with grilled Portobello mushrooms. J. added brie and I, cheddar. I think she selected the wheat bun, while I went with the white. n nAnd there was the poutine. Now, I'd been wanting to try poutine since I first made plans for Montreal. But the warm weather was making me have second thoughts. In the end, since we wanted fries anyway, J. insisted we split an order and it was good. High end poutine, but poutine nonetheless, with white cheese curds and a mushroom based gravy. If I could get this somewhere at home, mmmm . but I digress. n nThe burger was served quite simply on a small square plate, with a slice of tomato and a lengthwise sliced pickle, both of which I promptly removed. I wanted to experience just brgr. And I did. I could definitely taste the beef, and I liked it. If responsibly grazed cattle raised without antibiotics or growth hormones results in beef that tastes like this, I want more. In all, my customized burger with mushrooms and cheese was quite delicious. n nBy now, the Wings were embarrassing the Penguins in what would turn into a 5 0 blowout. But, since we were both craving a little something sweet, we decided to order one of the spiked shakes and watch the Penguins unravel a bit more. It's a good thing our tastes were so similar, because I don't think either of us wanted to spend another 12 apiece. We decided to split a Bailey's shake. This too was yummy. I love Bailey's and cream so what could be better than Bailey's with ice cream? I'll be making these at home now! n nThe tab was around 80 for the two of us, including a tip so definitely not a cheap place for a burger. But if you're willing to splurge a bit, I say get thee to M brgr.",2
"The burgers made fresh daily are great, and the pizza is among the best in the valley. nNice, cozy atmosphere.",2
"After reading the reviews on this place, I had high hopes that the food would be great. Can we say Chinese stew? We had the hot n sour and egg drop soup, and it was so thick it looked like stew. Both soups were especially mediocre and packed with ingredients that were either previously frozen or just cooked to death and void of any resemblance of their original state. The crab puffs were large wonton wrappers with cream cheese. The KungPow shrimp was a gluttonous glop of soaked veggies in a soup of sauce poured over beautiful shrimp that drowned. The teriyaki wood planks I think I ordered chicken were amply dry and chewy. I will try to dry them out a bit more for some chicken jerky for my next hiking trip. I will go find my special bottle of Alka Seltzer to round out this meal.",1
"So Big Daddy's isn't really as disappointing as I initally made it sound. It was never bad in the first place, it just didn't live up to my overly meticulous expectations. The caveat about this place though is you have to find something that works for you hence the endless amount of customization they offer.but at a premium of course. I'm still going to disagree with their credo not everything on the menu is very very tasty. Not all items are worth a second chance. n nThe Buffalo Chicken sandwich. It was chicken, I'll give them that. As far as the hot buffalo sauce though, it was either just sprinkled or just plain non existent. All you could taste was the overwhelming blue cheese. n nThe sides are still just sides. I can't say they're better than other chips, fries, tots, onion straws or mac N cheese I've had anywhere else. Tasty nonetheless. n nAnd now the star of the show. My favorite burger, the Sam I Am. Oh how I do love thee. I didn't think I'd like ham on my burger, but dang it fits the formula perfectly. Now the pesto I can do without. I was never a big fan of pesto in the first place, but I wanted to give it an audition with the burger. Now that I have, I'm still not a big fan of pesto. n nManagement makes it a point to ensure customers are satisfied and I still appreciate that. I like the uniqueness they bring to the table, and the inventive burgers although I might not like them all. You can't deny the fact that they strive to please and strive for perfection. With what seems like infinite ingredient combinations, I'm sure we can all find our pi u00e8ce de r u00e9sistance eventually.",2
This place is so good! Every single drink I've ordered has been perfect. Not to mention their beautiful presentation. Beats most of the coffee shops i've been to.,2
"I came across Big Apple Cleaners after searching on Yelp. I needed an affordable and convenient place for dry cleaning after a recent move and Al Phillips is just not worth the price they charge. Same day service is 1.00 extra per item, but still much less than AP. The staff was friendly and my items were ready when promised and looked fantastic. I will definitely return.",2
"My family and I have tried three pie varieties since Piefection opened at the beginning of September. The blueberry, coconut cream, and banana cream. All three have been wonderfully delicious. I cant wait for the next time I have an excuse to go pick up another pie. Looking forward to trying the peach next time!",2
"Brianna with Rouge is awesome. n nAfter several messages via Yelp, email and text, we met for a hair and make up trial. For the trial, we met in the Northwest, where she has a spot dedicated to just trials. I brought photos and ideas I was thinking of, and she also showed me some of her previous work. nThen wala! Brianna worked her skills and many years of experience on me, and I had my wedding look down. It was maybe a couple shades of color off from the lips but just minor adjustments for the big day. n nOn the big day, she arrived at my house early to set up. This time around did not take as long as the trial since Brianna knew exactly what she was going for. I looked flawless, how a bride should look, and it stayed all day. This includes the make up airbrush and hair updo . n nIf you are looking for fantastic, professional, not overdone makeup, Brianna's your gal!",2
"We adored The Kitchen. We ended up having 3 meals here while we were vacationing in Arizona. We were especially fond of the high quality ingredients in the sandwiches and chopped salad. The cheese plate, although expensive at 17, was worth every penny we were presented with a large board laden with 5 enormous hunks of cheese, dried fruits, marcona almonds and honey. I wish they'd open a shop in Boston!",2
"Yay for uptown for having a healthier alternative to the regular options of not so healthy food that seem to be the norm these days. They have a variety of sandwiches, salads coffee, tea and smoothies that you can nosh on in the seating area to the side of it pretty retro esque too, I like or take it to go and eat al fresco like I did! I got the Saladena sandwich roasted red peppers, artichokes, mozzarella, balsamic and spinach on a tomato basil roll. It was absolutely fantastic and fresh! They have duo and trio specials as well 6.95 and 8.95 respectively. n nA bit pricey for what I would like to spend on lunch but for food that contains organic ingredients, I am willing to pay the extra money. Unlike other establishments, they take portion sizes into consideration so you may not be getting as much as more well know lunch spots yet you are getting all you need. They list the calorie and fat content of their site so you can see what you're taking in. Their sandwiches are wrapped in environmentally friendly soy coated blynk paper which is just cool and wish more places would take into consideration. All in all, I am happy to have a place like Uptown we need more places like Blynk.",2
"I've been here a few times, it's ok in a pinch. The calzone was soggy on the bottom, so was the pizza crust. Usually I'll drive past it on my way to Spinato's, even Gus' down the street has better food.",1
"This was my first time at Vdara and I was excited for this ""5 star "" resort experience. Unfortunately, it felt more like a three star hotel room. The pull out bed was horrendous, even with the feather down pad that you have to request. They don't provide cots and they talk to you on the phone like you're bothering them somehow. The regular bed was fine though. nThe room layout was not what the front desk rep described and was not very intimate or private. n nThe internet was unreliable and it took some time and effort to get the front desk on the line to ask for a late checkout and for your car to be pulled up from valet, both of which they could and would not do for you. I did not feel valued or very welcomed as a guest and it was an overall disappointment. I would not recommend this hotel to friends. Frankly, the best part of the room was the view and bath robe.",1
"An extremely surprising delight n nA few months ago my boyfriend were driving around looking for some mid day lunch. We went through the usual ""Want Cheesecake factory? "" ""Nah. "" ""TGIF? "" ""Nah "" and we drove by Le Chalet, figuring it was another crepe place. Boy were we surprised n nThe restaurant inside is so quaintly and artistically designed that you instantly get the impression that you are not in just another crepe place. n nI can't tell you the names of the items we had cause they were all authentic swiss french cuisines, far beyond the usual ""fromage "" and ""poulet "" n nWe've been there twice so far and each time was individually fantastic n nWe've had the mussel with rice, w hich is by far the best mussels i've ever had. We've had the swiss cheese fondue which is over the top. This time we had the pate and their specialty meat dish, which regrettably I can't remember the name n nWhat stands out most about this place is the overall effort and service that the staff provides. The waitresses are extremely educated in the menu and you can tell they really listen to what you'd like. n nThe chefs in the kitchen you can tell from even afar that they really focus on their dishes. Nothing is frozen, everything is made from scratch down to the sauce. nChef Anthony Perre Ferre can't remember personally flambed our dinner right by our table. He was extremely friendly, funny, informative and talented. n nEverything from the food, to the wine selection, to the waitresses to the chefs make this place an extreme diamond in the rough in Peoria. n nGreat job guys! You definitely have a permanent customer from me",2
"Was really hoping for a better experience. Once we walked in, we noticed there weren't a lot of people for a Saturday afternoon and college football. We liked the idea of a dog theme, and the peanuts in dog bowls. We really were disappointed that our waiter had no idea of what beer was available, which resulted in my having to order a different beer 3 times because it turned out the beer wasn't available. I commented to our waiter that the manager needs to do a better job in having the opening meeting to outline the beer selection so the waitstaff are prepared and don't look like fools to their customers.and the waiter agreed. Never saw the manager making rounds. The chicken wings were just average and I have to say the Thai peanut sauce is too thick and pasty. We drank our one beer each and had a few wings and left. I don't foresee us going back, too bad.",1
"We decided to try this place for lunch today and it was okay at best. Its nothing special. Its similar to Elmer's Tacos or Someburro's but I would actually prefer one of those places over this Los Favoritos. Their red hot sauce was odd because I could taste no flavor just the onset of a spiciness. The rice was moist, which was good, and the refried beans were fine. Nothing was awful it just wasn't anything to rave about. The place was clean and the staff was friendly. But since I prefer the tastes of the places listed above I probably won't be back.",1
"Hope you're not in a hurry.2hour wait, have screwed up my records in past visits, no one really seems to know what's going on.doctors are fine, but service is atrocious.if u cannot handle the schedule, you need to reduce how many you see a day",1
"On my second trip to the P.U.B., I was sadly disappointed to learn that my beloved Fr u00fcli strawberry beer had been taken off the menu! We actually almost left, because that was kind of the only reason we went back, but the waitress brought me a sample of a raspberry beer and I decided to stay. The raspberry was good, but it's no Fr u00fcli. n nThis time, I had something from the carvery section of the menu, and I would definitely make that decision again. I had roasted turkey breast with challah and two sauces blue cheese fondue and truffle mayo. I ate every last drop of the latter, it was so fantastic the blue cheese was delicious, as well. I sat at the table, drinking my fruity beer and happily making my own cheesey, truffley, turkeylicious sandwiches. It was awesome.",2
"Food was underwhelming and a bit overpriced. Ambience and service were OK. It's possibly the nicest ""creative pub food "" place on State Street and as another reviewer points out a good man date level of decor. n nFries, sweet potato fries, and aoili were very good but sandwiches were generally blah. n nI had the Bucky Burger 11 w fries . It was pretty small and didn't come with any fixings aside from a really blah pickle spear on the side it was just the burger, sauce, slice of cheese, bit of beef brisket on top, and bun the bun was very good . The patty was too densely packed and came well done i.e., they don't come medium or medium rare nor did they ask how I wanted my burger . Were the burgers pre made? They source most of their meats from Black Earth generally a good sign because other delicious places in town do, too. n nThe place was bit nicer than Dotty's Dumpling Dowry but the food definitely didn't compare. A decent place for a meal if you want a place to have a conversation. The more artisinal, original sandwiches that my friends ordered seemed interesting but I figured it'd be easier to judge the merits of this place on its burger. n nIt's kind of ""seat yourself "" with a bar, long row of bar stool tables and a few booths.",1
"Awesome place for breakfast. Saturday mornings before hitting the farmers market down the street is so much fun. I usually just get eggs but had to try the turkey sausage from my hubbys demi bkfast. So good, I mean soo darn good.",2
"Great job, on time, fast and reasonable! Now my go to guy for any plumbing issues!",2
"Let me start by stating I am not a complainer! Okay my arrival, only 1 of the elevators in the parking lot worked out of 3 leaving a large crowd of people waiting for the elevator through several runs . Then at registration the line was outrageous and it took us about an hour to get to the desk. When we got to the room there was a king size bed, although I had requested 2 queen beds for the kids , with a little heckling and them letting me know that my request was simply that a REQUEST they moved us to a room with 2 queen beds. When my son's went to take a shower the water was cold, you can imagine a 7 and 10 year old trying to take a cold shower. The rooms and the grounds were generally unclean. We stayed here because we thought it would be fun for the kids, but we will not return. To end on a positive, the bagel place located on the promenade was delicious.",1
"Stopped in here before a Diamondbacks game, because we had just learned that the Copper Door located a few feet away was no longer in business. n nHey, it really smelled like a bar. but it is a bar, so good job! n nThe fish and chips were OK. The Irish stew was OK. The Blue Moon had a big wedge of orange, and it was great. They had bottled Bud Light. And the review from ""suneel t. "" wonderfully described the patrons.",1
Excellent deli short drive from the strip. Salami and egg breakfast was excellent. Bagels are top notch. Please note cash only. Update they now take credit cards via 4square.,2
"We stayed here last week because they are a pet friendly hotel. Honestly I should have looked elsewhere. The rooms were dirty, as the maids couldn't be bothered to lift the bed skirts to vacuum underneath the bed. We found a huge earring, dust galore, and what looked to be 5 month old cheetos. We have 2 cats and a small child, the room's uncleanliness was unacceptable. The A C units were extremely loud and not running as they should, because the room never got that cool.They did not have comment cards in the comment card envelopes so we could not leave a review. n nThe buffet was lackluster at best. While it was cheap, the quality of food reflected it. I wasn't really satisfied with anything I ate that night, and could definitely tell that most of the food was pre processed food that I could buy myself at the store. n nI give this place 2 stars and not one because the staff was very very friendly. Also, The cafe was great for breakfast in the morning. My veggie omelet was great.",1
"We have a sprinkles in Dc and I am not impressed with their cupcakes but after the high roller ride my hubby had a sweet tooth. The shop was packed but not cramped like in DC. There were not many cupcake flavor options maybe 4 5 different ones. My husband got the banana cupcake and thought it was good. I got a vanilla with sprinkles and it wasn't good at all to me. I am giving them a two because we had small talk with the employees and they were really friendly. The shop was also clean and not cramped. There are a few tables inside and outside for customers. Sprinkles is located in a cool looking newly renovated alley area that takes you to other restaurants, shops, and the high roller. Like I said I'm not a fan of Sprinkles but maybe others enjoy their brand.",1
"Yes, Mr. Ramsay, you've hit the spot. n nIt is very difficult for me to finish my whole meal at times. Especially, when the burgers are bigger than my face. However, I had absolutely no problem finishing my Southern Yardbird Burger. I ate and I ate and I ate and I finished. I don't think I looked up once to check of my friends were still at the table. n nAlso, the fries there are a must! HOW CAN YOU HAVE A BURGER WITHOUT FRIES!?!? n nThe restaurant was reasonably priced. I took 50 for my meal just in case and I only spent 20 including tip. Not bad at all.",2
Im writing a 5 star review because this place is the only place where they do EVERYTHING without missing a beat. I never have to inspect and point out what they missed. Tyrone and Mario are awesome and they always make sure things are running at full speed. I use this place as opposed to the location near home because its right near work and is easier for me to swing through on my lunch break. Ill be there today too!,2
I loved going to the prenatal yoga classes. I feel the instructors were great and worked to address any needs I had. I feel that by doing yoga at shining light prenatal it empowered me as well as gave me the tools to have a natural birth.,2
"Stopped in here for some of their bakery goods. The taro bun cake and the chocolate bun cake are very fresh and really good. There is just a bit of pastry creme inside. I don't usually do the shopping, but I enjoy strolling through the isles looking over the goods. I love Asian markets and enjoy discovering new things. I usually have to ask my husband what it is and what it's used in, and often find it intriguing. n nThis store appears clean, smells aren't too bad, and the prices are pretty good!",2
"WOW! I was in Charlotte for 2 days attending a concert at the PNC Pavilion and did an online search for vegan restaurants. Happy to report that this place is phenomenal! I absolutely love that they offer 100 vegan options! I ordered the ""Crabby Patty "" sandwich with macaroni and ""cheese "" on the side and was positively blown away. Additionally, my server was super friendly and attentive. I will definitely return the next time I'm in Charlotte!",2
"This place is probably the most ""real "" Bavarian beer hall experience you'll find in the states. They do all the German drinking songs and serve all the Bavarian food. The prices aren't bad, considering we paid just about as much for drinks food in actual Bavaria. The music was fabulous, and the beer was top notch. For those who just want a nice time hanging with friends, while singing German drinking songs and toasting to a liter of delightful brew, it doesn't get any better than this!",2
"I love Zia Records. Yes. I am an ""old man "" who still buys CDs. I used to have thousands of CDs and I converted them all to mp3 then all of my files got corrupted so never again. I am back to CDs. No file corruption here. nThis is probably one of the only places left where you can still buy CDs and have a great selection. Now they don't have every single album by every single artist but who does. That is probably a good thing because then I would end up buying half the store. So you might have to go back a few times to find what you are looking for. No big deal. It is nice to roam around the stacks. nThey have every kind of music there is. So even you weirdos who listen to things no one has ever heard of or shouldn't hear ever they have it. The prices aren't too bad either. You could probably go on line and save some money but by the time you pay shipping and wait around you probably didn't really save that much. nI will definitely keep coming back here. Great selection, clean and organized store and friendly staff. Plus how can you beat a local record store. nCDs forever! At least until they get rid of file corruption or another format come out.",2
"I decided to take the family to RedBrick Pizza since it was so close to Cinemark Theatres and BassPro Shop. Besides, it convenient location to where I wanted to be, I decided to stroll in with my family. The decor was nice, it was lively, with background music, and the ultimate, a TV at every booth. My wife and I knew this was the place, that we could actually carry on a conversation without the kids meddling in our conversation. We walked over to the counter, looked at the menu and decided to order the Chopped Chinese Chicken Salad, a Large Order of Chesse Breadsticks, and a Large Pizza, half Pepperoni and half Vegetable Gourmet. nThe salad and breadsticks came first, in most places it comes all together.My kids ate most of the salad, however, we enjoyed every bit of it. It was freshly tossed in an Oriental Dressing, only one word WOW! if the kids eat salad, please eat more. The breadsticks were absolutely brilliant, hot, cheesy, and the right amount. We waited just about two minutes after finishing those two items and magically came the pizza.It was phenomenal, thin crust, hot, and the right amount of ingredients. Then after we finished, my little girl, decided to want to try some Gelato. if you never had Gelato, go try it, it has less fat and CALORIES then regular Ice Cream it was a delight, mouthwatering, full of flavor in every bite.My recommendation WE ARE GOING BACK!",2
"BoSa is in Scottsdale! They just opened today.we sampled a dozen at work this morning and they are delicious. The glazed is so very tasty and the texture is much more substantial than the Krispy Kreme glazed, but still very light. I also tried the apple fritter like another review commented, crispy outside, light and fluffy and apply inside and the Boston creme.this is my measure for all donut places. It was very, very good. n nThe new location is at 7444 E McDowell Rd.",2
Do not use this taxi company! Mean drivers with tempers. I won't be calling them ever again!,1
"Sandwiches are CRAZY huge, which would be great if you have a fridge handy for leftovers. n nI ordered the Woody Allen, a 2 lb. pastrami and corned beef monster. I ended up eating about a 1 4 of the entire sandwich made it through the corned beef on one HALF of the sandwich, and couldn't eat any more. I didn't mind paying 20 for a sandwich you can't be too frugal on the strip but wasting all that food was just a shame. You can split sandwiches for a 3.50 plate fee, but the fact that they don't have anything smaller than 1lb. of meat on a sandwich just doesn't make sense. n nWhat I did have was delicious, and service for us was decent, but out of control portion sizes mean I won't be coming back.",1
"I've been here twice, the first time I thought the food was bad. Went back a 2nd time because I was out there again and there is really no where else to go. Figured, ""food can't be as bad as I remember. "" It was, maybe worse the 2nd time. Service wasn't good either. I love Mexican food, but his just is not good.",1
"I was in the Bella suite with one other girl, so that was pretty sweet. I guess that's the perk of being 1 of 2 girls in the company. The room was very nice and could comfortably sleep 6 people including the pull out sofa bed . However, I don't think there's enough room for 6 people's luggage and stuff. n nThe casino is pretty fun. I'm not a huge gambler, so I didn't spend too much time on the casino floor. We did get the 12 of us and play craps, which was super fun. n nApparently the 20 trick works here. My boss had done it and we all got upgraded to these Bella suits not too sure about the penthouse that they had already booked . n nIn any case, the Palazzo is very nice. It overlooks the Encore pool XS, so it's great that it's super close to those clubs. It's NOT walking distance to Marquee Cosmo well, it is but it's freaking far do not receommend, especialy in heels .",2
"So I originally wanted to go to the ramen place in the same plaza, but the wait was so atrociously long we decided to just hit up Big Wong. Did a quick yelping and saw that the beef ramen was supposed to be good and since I was already in the fixing for ramen anyways I decided to give it a shot. n nIt was at best.mediocre. The broth had an average taste with nothing unique about it, however, the beef was very fatty and not enjoyable to eat. Next time I will definately choose to wait for the other ramen joint rather than be impatient.",1
"This is by far the tiniest Flemings I've been to, and I've only been to 2 others The other Vegas location and the Newport Beach one. n nMy complaint with the set up is there's no barricade from the bar and the formal dining area. With the loud groups in the bar area, your so called quiet night can be ruined. Plus, they have 2 big TV's mounted on the bar, which can be distracting if you're facing the bar and you keep looking at the hockey game, instead of paying attention to your meal. n nBeing said that, I made my 7 00 reservation and was seated promptly. but by the door right AND next to the bar! No thank you! I wanted a nice quiet dinner, not next to the group of prom or wedding goers who were loud and obnoxious, taking selfies and group pics. n nI asked to be seated elsewhere and the hostess said it'll be a bit of a wait. I'm guessing other people had their table 'ear marked' because I saw a few empty tables she could have seated me at. n nWe stood by the door thinking it'll be just a few minutes. We should have moved to the bar, if we had known the wait would have been 45 minutes longer. n nOther couples came in and not once did the hostess offer them the ""crummy "" table. I wonder why they offered it to me? Maybe because I was getting 40 off my 100 meal offer that gave me a crummy table? n nAt 8 00 we get seated at a MUCH nicer circlular booth and our server was very friendly. She never asked if we dined at Flemings and started telling us how to use the iPod for wine, and also assumed I must rarely eat red meat, as she told us how the dry aged steaks were better than the other aged steaks. n nStephen and I decided to share a steak, so we each ordered a starter, he got the Wedge Salad, I got the Shrimp Cocktail, then we ordered a NY Strip to share, and 2 sides The Signature Onion Rings, and the Garlic Mashed. n n nThe food was delicious, and they got 4 stars but quite honestly I think 3 stars could suffice. n nThankfully I got my gift card at Costco 100 card for 79.99 and with the discount from the email 40 off the bill if you spend 100 our 121 meal came to 81! That's the best way to eat at Flemings! n nPLENTY of free parking, so I don't know why people would valet it. but I guess if you want to impress your date, go for it. Its only 10 less steps than where I parked.",2
Most of the staff are friendly. their Avocado smoothie with coffee jelly is Yummmy. their sushi rolls arent that bad.but it sure does take a LONG while to get your food.,2
"Long long long wait time! Appointment at 915 am arrived at 845 am, time check 1045 and still waiting! What's the point of making an appointment? They should be paying patients 35 bucks for not showing up on time! First and last time going to this clinic! FAIL!",1
"4 Peaks, thank you for existing. You serve me delicious beer and food that would stand alone as 5 star class. Your salmon BTL makes me question my prior understanding of beautiful. Your only flaw is a testament to your goodness, you can be a little too busy from time to time. n nYou are a jewel of Tempe and I salute you. Cheers.",2
"Nowadays it's very hard to find truly reliable people that you can do business with and at the end of the transaction, be 100 satisfied. Well, that's my experience with A P Carpet. I had installed carpeting in half my house already by another company called ""Carpet World "" avoid them, they simply don't care about the customer simply stopped returning my calls and I was left with no recourse but to look for someone else to continue the job. In a sense, I am glad it happened this way. I called on a late Saturday morning for an estimate and Art was at my door an hour later ready to give me an actual price. I must say that I was very impressed since I live about an hour away from their location. Art is a true businessman. He did all the calculations in his mind and he gave me a low price on different carpet options. He was very attentive to what we wanted and he was extremely courteous throughout the whole process. He also worked around my schedule and I had the carpet installed on a Wednesday exactly the day I needed it to be. The installers that came out were professionals and they were very quick. They laid 700 SQF of carpet in about three hours. Foremost, they did an excellent job it came out exactly the way I had hope for. I would recommend A P Carpet to anyone in the valley that is looking to install some carpet.",2
Super yummy! Seriously we could have eaten here three days in a row. nIt is a hidden gem. nThe service was awesome and the owner was a nice guy and came out to talk to us. We had a great time just hanging out here. n nWe mostly just had sushi and it was all great. n nOutstanding place. A real find and so reasonable! Loved it!,2
"Came here while in Vegas for the weekend. I split 2 sandwiches, The Chicken avocado, and the Full Montagu.The chicken was perfectly cooked and flavorful, the avocado was smoother and ripe, and went perfectly with the sauce. The Full Montagu was also delicious, but not as good as the limited time Chicken Avocado. n nJust inside the Planet Hollywood and open 24 7. It wasn't crazy when we went about 9pm on Wed, but I assume it gets packed for lunch or on the weekend. I cant wait to go back!",2
"It's the kind of place that I order what I think will be great, and it is, but everyone else seems to have ordered something even better. I walk out thinking, it's a bit more than what I usually want to spend, but I'm glad we went. The kind of place when we wonder where to go for seafood we wind up there. nIt seems to have been transplanted, or at least the best replica in Phoenix, of Louisiana when I look at the clientele, who look like transplants from New Orleans looking for a good place to eat. It's lively, and is beautiful building with a red brick courtyard. The staff is knowledgeable, and very helpful to someone raised here and not that familiar with the great variety of seafood. I usually tip larger there than any other place. I've been accused of having moths fly out of my wallet so I have to rate this place very highly. In fact, for seafood I've been here the most often, having been very disappointed with other places in the valley.",2
"Finally used my Groupon today. It was a long trek for me considering the chicken is only mediocre. It seemed that they overcooked the pieces and they were not juicy at all. Taste wise, as others have said, is a bit salty and lacking flavor. I still prefer Church's or Popeye's. The wait is quite long 30 mins as they make everything to order though I was the first customer of the day! The mac cheese is not homemade and comes from an institutional bake and serve aluminum pan package observed them taking it our from the oven . n nThe staff was very courteous, but somewhat inefficient. I noticed that my chicken has been ready for almost 5 minutes and I see them transferring the mac cheese from the aluminum pans to the holding pan. Why didn't they just package my mac cheese so I can be on my way?",1
Excellent show. Too bad it is ending soon. Musicals aren't really my thing but a lot of the tunes are catchy. Costumes are really cool and the movements are very animal like. n n nMy girlfriend loved it and would give it 5 stars.,2
"Not a huge fan. Seems all reviews on here are 4 5 stars but don't let that fool you. n nWhat reeled us in was the bait planted outside the door. The girls outside were smokin' hot literally, they were smoking.cigarettes! n nThe 10 cover was bogus, I expected to see a lot more scenery for that price. The place was crowded, felt a little cramped in there and not much wiggle room. n nThe drinks were pretty standard priced for the type of club and the girls were extremely hot, but with a 10 cover it was a waste to see painted nipples! n nI won't come back here unless I'm wasted or they lower the cover charge.",1
"oh happy day.absolutely delicious meatball banhi mi on perfect baguette. n nthey DO take credit cards, btw.a lot of places in the mall are cash only but not here. n nand that free bread pic that another yelper posted wasn't a coincidence.I really wanted to take a bag but thought I'd save it for someone else. n nLee's Sandwiches down the street isn't open but getting my Hue Thai fix worked for me.",2
"So just to preface my review, I would like to let it be known that I hardly ever provide reviews the only other time I did is when I had a roach stuck to a pot sticker and the waiter didn't even apologize or care and just asked what he wanted me to do about it . However, if I didn't leave a review on this establishment, I would honestly feel guilty for doing so since I would want to be warned prior to coming here. n nWe ordered our food and my girlfriend decided to change her order right after I gave mine and the waitress made the change but showed an obvious frustration in the process. Since the tables are close, we chatted a bit with the woman next to us who gave the wrong room for her bill to be added to. I jokingly said to the waiter ""sorry we are making it hard for you "" and she replies ""its OK I am used to people doing it "" with no smile or sign of sarcasm humor and just walks away. n nI had to flag the waiter down after approximately 20 minutes to inquire about the milkshake. She forgot about it. Thirty one minutes from the time we ordered I receive the milkshake I know this for a fact because I sent a text message right when we ordered . We received our food at the same time as the people across from us who came in more than 20 minutes after us. n nThe food was average. Nothing spectacular but nothing I would complain about. I did request light mayo on my sandwich but received both sides of the bread smeared thickly with it. n nWhen we were ready to leave, we had to flag her down twice before she would get me the bill. We were there for lunch on an early Wednesday afternoon for more than an hour. n nI would never recommend this establishment to anyone.",1
"I just changed over after 30 years with Cox. Cox raised my bill by 20 with no notice. nThe first agent I spoke with at Direct TV read her script so fast that I could not understand a word she said. I asked her twice to please slow down. The third time I attempted to ask her, she talked right over me so I hung up. n nThe next agent spoke clearly enough that I could understand her. What a joke! nI understood that my monthly bill would be 10 less than I was charged. When I called to have this corrected, I was told that I had declined the offer a total lie and that nothing could be done to change this. I even spoke with a supervisor, who gave me the same bs. Apparently, they are not at all concerned with customer satisfaction. n nLIARS AND THEIVES.that's Direct TV.",1
"Under no circumstance should one ever come here. My experience was awful but I will boil things down to one event so ridiculous it will leave you in awe. The waitress brought my drink and dropped it when transferring it to me, she was balancing the tray on one hand while making me take my own drink off the tray myself. After it fell she insisted I still pay for it! The argument got so heated a third person had it get involved and pay for it. Which still left me with a bad taste because another customer ended up paying for it just to settle things down, which really should have been what the manager should have done. n nAvoid this place at all costs.",1
I like flavor and the carne asada had ZERO flavor. The restaurant is very nice and the spiked agua fresca was awesome. BUT the food has no flavor. Good for drinks not for food. Chips and salsa are ok.,1
Good food. Good ambience. Very healthy. Nice selection of tea and lemonade. Disgustingly small portions though. Good spot for a LIGHT lunch.,2
"We eat here all the time and it is one of our favorite seafood places in Vegas. The portions are large, the food is fresh and the value is good. Fridays have appetizer specials for 5 each and we usually chow down on all of those. The crab is always well prepared and the oysters are tasty. The service is generally prompt and professional.",2
"So I'm pretty sure I just found my new nail home . I absolutely adore my nails. I am that annoying customer that ask for acrylics, then immediately ask for them ridiculously short. No i don't want gel on my real nails to make them look thicker . They did everything I ever wanted a nail tech to do. After searching for the last 3years since my former guy moved, I am beyond happy to have found this place n nEveryone needs to go here. It's not expensive, but you leave feeling like a diva.",2
Great sushi,2
"I was really impressed by Fred's. We checked out their happy hour on Friday night and it was great! The decor is very Frank Lloyd Wright, so loved it! The service was good and the food drink was great as well. We shared the meatball sliders, risotto balls, pommes frites and a prosciutto pizza yum!",2
"I have eaten here at least 12 times and the sushi is always fresh. It is a bit expensive but you get what you pay for. Service is always great. If you haven't tried Kabuki yet, you need too",2
"Really long wait this morning. Orders were getting lost, customers were waiting a really long time, and there was lots of complaining from the cook. nThis is only my second chance to try this restaurant and will probably be the last. To start off my experience, my wife and I were asked to wait for a seat. Normally, this is no problem but I could see at least 4 tables that were clean and nobody sitting at them. Not a big deal as we were in no hurry. nWe were seated and taken care of right away. We ordered coffee and water and needed a couple of minutes do decide on our food. My wife ordered the French toast and I ordered biscuits and gravy. For the next twenty minutes we listened to the cook argue with the waitresses and watched customers walk out the front door. Almost 30 ,minutes went by and our food finally arrived. I got scrambled eggs instead of over easy and the waitress fixed it right away. My wife's meal was warm but certainly not hot. nAs I dug into my biscuits and gravy, I was greeted by crunchy biscuits and a sad excuse for gravy. The biscuits tasted like the kind you would get in a tube of Pillsbury and I needed a knife to cut them. The gravy was clumpy and tasteless. I have been cooking gravy for many years and it looked like the flour, or mix, in this case was thrown in and not blended very well. This was, by far, the worst plate of biscuits and gravy I have every eaten. Biscuits and gravy is a relatively easy dish to do well and it says volumes when a breakfast restaurant cannot do it right. nI did let the girl at the register know how disappointed I was with my breakfast and she took it off my bill. That was very cool. nMy first time to Rise and Shine was pretty good and the second was less than impressive. I was told that the reason the prices were a little high is because of the quality ingredients that were used. I would disagree. It seems like either corners are being cut or the cooks are not happy with their jobs. Either way, this will probably be my last adventure out of the way to come to Rise and Shine.",1
"I only come here with my daughter and always have the same thing. Cheese Pizza and Cheesy Bread Sticks. Their pizza is delicious as well as their bread sticks. I see people ordering sandwiches and other items but I figure why mess with a good thing. Their prices are very reasonable, less than 15 bucks for 2 people. Their pizza is very cheesy and always served hot. n nThe only thing I would change about this place is the parking. There is always a full lot. Probably because they share with a karate studio, a sandwich shop I won't mention by name and a vet. Also very annoying that they have 15 minute parking spots.the lot isn't that big that they need to dedicate 15 minute spots.and ps.if you are eating pizza.maybe walking 20 30 extra feet is good exercise. Just my thoughts.",2
"Took my Mini in for a stalling issue that would not throw a code. Took 2 days but they did fix the problem at great expense . When I picked up my car, however, they had put 125 miles on it over the course of 2 3 days and damaged the arm rest and hood. To be fair, the writer had called on day 2 to ask if they could drive it a little to make sure the fix was good but 125 miles ?!?! . They did fix the hood and armrest when I took it back in. Had to be ignored for 25 minutes first, tho. Got the usual laundry list of disastrous items that needed immediate attention. Ordered the parts on line and had my usual mechanic install them for 1 3 the price that the dealership wanted. Now I wonder if I even needed those repairs.",1
"My stop here was at the request of my Son. Geeze the bowl I had was very bland and warm at best. The chicken was very tough and it tasted like they just threw it all together with tap water. I see why it might be popular for the students.inexpensive for the amount of food. But guys, there was no taste to it. My Sons also was bland. Now wonder there is so much Sriracha dry spices around. But, it all needs to be cooked together in my opinion for flavor.",1
"Ok, real talk time. This is a sports bar, and they also run OTB off trck betting . That's a thing, and that means there are some folks in there just to watch the races and bet, maybe grab a beer and that's all. Does that bug me? Not one bit. n nAs far as the bar and restaurant portion is concerned, this place is everything I like. The bartenders and servers remember my name, what I drink, always smile when I come in, and have a blast doing what they do. They play all my games NFL, MLB, NHL and even EUFA Champion's League and MLS . If I want to watch something near where I'm seated, they always do their best to accommodate. Couple that with cheap, cold beers, strong pours, and really decent bar food, and you have a winner. n nAnd let's talk food. I'm a vegan, and it kills me to sit near the kitchen. The wings smell amazing, the sandwiches and burgers are piled high, the fries are hand cut and awesome, and the things I do eat the fried zucchini, chips and salsa, etc. have been great. Mikey, one of the cooks, pulls double duty as a great cook and storyteller. He's one of the things that makes the place fun to spend time at. n nI've read some of the other reviews about bad service I've seriously never had any here, and I have a hunch half of them aren't legit. I've come here when Charity, Amanda, Destiny, Boston, Nick and a few others were serving, and honestly I've never waited more than 2 minutes for a drink and that was when they were slammed. Food has always been good, and fast, and filling. Charity is freaking awesome, and Boston knows every game's outcome before it happens. He's like Rain Man or something, an absolute riot. n nBottom line If you're looking for a white glove one on one service experience, go to one of the foofy places nearby. Want an awesome sports bar with good food, drinks, people, music and a fun atmosphere? Get here, and I'll buy your first pint.",2
"ate here four times in three days on my last weekend trip to vegas, mostly while faded. the place is just so convienent if you're staying at the Venetian or any of the connected hotels. probably the best fries on the strip crispy and super salty and the sloppy joe sandwich is the perfect way to end the night.at 5am.",2
"Cafe 1010 is one of the best breakfast spots in Phoenix. I highly recommend getting the pancakes they are delicious! Also, if you are on the go this is a great place to grab breakfast as take out. They have great service here!",2
"Service sucks. The hostess surly, middle aged blond was unbelievably rude. I don't know if she was having a bad day, but she did not need to take it out on customers. No tacos are worth that attitude. Good riddance. n n PS on Apr 3 I see other reviews suggesting the surly middle aged blond may have been the owner. That is so much worse than a nasty hostess. If I could give this place a 0 stars, I would. n nPPS for the surly blond Did you know you burn more calories with a smile than a scowl? It might help with the thick thighs.",1
"I only experienced the food as take out. I was not impressed. n nWe ordered sesame chicken. The chicken we got was soggy, doused in sauce, and not sesame like at all. n nThe fried rice and noodles were sub par at best. I won't be back There are too many other inexpensive Chinese take out places with better product.",1
Cool atmosphere. Lots of couch seating areas which is always good. Food was decent but the service was a bit lacking. Probably because they just opened and are going through growing pains.,2
"I love the food here at Thai Rama, but it's been awhile since I ate here. Everything I've ever had here was very delicious. However, it's far from where we live and not so convenient to dine here. Periodically I have come here with my extended family and food is good, but service is so so. n nAlthough this is bad to say, I think if you're really Asian and going more to an Asian restaurant, although this does have an American flair to it, we don't tend to get great service. Not sure why that is, but maybe it's a part of the culture. Maybe if we were a bunch of white folks, we'd get better service, but then, maybe the food would taste different. n nAuthentic Asian food tastes better than the Americanized versions. Thai Rama is like 50 50 and that's fine with me. The Asian population is very spread out in the Phx area, so it's hard to do super authentic Asian whether it's Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese or whatever because most likely most of your customers will be more accustomed and want the American taste of Asian food, so I don't blame them. n nThai Rama is about my favorite Thai place and it's reasonably priced.",2
"Very dissapointing. Service was very slow, and they insisted on self tipping themselves 20 for takeout! I walked out on principle.",1
Ok I've said this before. Seriously. WTF is strawberry chicken? The cook was probably sitting there. Oh Americans they like the orange chicken. Why they eat so much? Oh Mr Fried Chicken I walk with you in my hand while I think of better sauce.oh no I trip on my shoeraces and chicken fall into my strawberry pie.wha.waaa.wait. GREAT IDEA! nI wanna be in the chef's meeting for that. I mean really.were they having Marie Calendar's Strawberry Pie when that happened? I dunno who orders it. But whatever floats your boat. Ok the crab rangoons.Why are they double wrapped with so much wanton wrapper like they're gonna get an std? I mean seriously CRUNCH CRUNCH plus a liddo bit of crab.Ok for really for what it is.this place is ok. It's fast chinese american food. The food isn't handled with love. It's like a short order cook dream. Lunch specials for the corporate guy girl on the go. It's inexpensive. For what it is.eh. Give me panda. BTW Uhm yea it was a 3. But minus 1 for STRAWBERRY CHICKEN? WTF?,1
"Stopped in for a burger before the movie. Good choice, it was prepared very quickly and it was very tasty. I had the mushroom and swiss plenty of very thin cut mushrooms and a slice of Swiss cheese on top of a thin grilled burger. The bun was perfect. My daughter chose the bacon and avocado. She also enjoyed it thoroughly. n nThe fries were a hit. Nice and thin shoestring fries, but not salty at all. Awesome. I put a hit of Cholula in with the ketchup and got a nice zing to them. Yum. n nTwo burgers, fries and two drinks for under 20? I'd do this again.",2
"A great family run, taste of Italy ristorante, that I say ""Ciao bella ""! n nWe arrived last night looking forward to a well prepared Italian meal. Our expectations were peaked by all our Yelp friends, raving about the personal service and delicious old style Italian food. We weren't disappointed. n nThe owner, Pasquale greeted us as we came in, and sat us in the back. It would provide a good place to observe his personal touch with all the customers. Our server Cody came by almost immediately to ask if we had brought any wine, and if he could open it and bring us glasses. As others have noted, Ristorante Giuseppe is a Bring Your Own BYOB place. n nOur oldest was celebrating her Birthday Day, so we were in a festive mood. I've taken some photos of the interior of the restaurant. Clearly they were working on that Italian Grotta feel. It has some buca di beppo type wall decorations. But unlike that chain, here it's decorated by actual family photos and vacations shots. Very genuine! Just like Pasquale. n nWe started out with the bruschetta. It came with four pieces of italian bread for 10.95. It might have seemed pricey, though the tomatoes were sweet and had a interesting topping of several cheeses. Delicious. We next shared the Antipasto. It was a very full plate of greens, meats and cheeses for 8.95. The dressing was a light oil and vinegar that was just right. n nFor our entree, we each tried something different. I went for the capellini with their homemade Neopolitan sauce. Cody talked me into one of their meatballs, which was good. But, not as good as their pasta and red sauce. Sometimes with a marinara, if it's left to cook too long it can get bitter. Not here, it was naturally sweet with chucks of tomato. n nMy wife ordered her favorite dish of Chicken Parmigiana, that came with spaghetti for 14.95. It wasn't a pounded piece of chicken cutlet, but instead an entire breast. Very nice! Our daughter ordered the spicy Pasta Alex for 15.95. The menu describes it as the Chef's creation of pasta in a cardinale pesto sauce with roasted garlic and spicy, crumbled, Italian sausage. It was outstanding! The heat came from the crusted red peppers and was just right. The sauce actually reminded me more of a vodka cream reduction. It was sweet and full of flavor. Clearly the best of all the dishes! n nFor dessert, we tried the flour less Chocolate cake, the Tiramisu and a Cannoli for 4.95 each. I've taken a picture of the Tiramisu, because it came as an individual piece of two moist lady fingers. Wow! n nIf you're out and it's late, I would highly recommend coming here just for dessert and espresso. It would be well worth it. n nOur bill came to 88 in change including taxes but before gratuities. It was hand written and not itemized. Another one of those personal touches which some might find quirky. n nAfter getting home, I exchanged a bunch of messages with Yelp'er Michael T on how delicious the sauces were at Giuseppe's. It's that unbridled enthusiasm and passion that folks have for this restaurant and it's owner Pasquale that make it special. n nIf you are looking for a white table cloth, foo foo experience you might be disappointed and not understand the beauty of Ristorante Giuseppe. But, we weren't, and we'll be back real soon. n nEnjoy!",2
"Items Selected nMac Cheese Balls House made bacon mac cheese balled up in Panko breadcrumbs and golden fried nFried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich Fried Chicken with Applewood Smoked Bacon Waffles and Wild Turkey Maple Syrup served with Sweet Potato Tots nFrench Toast Vanilla Bean Soaked Brioche topped with 'drunk' mixed berries, syrup, powdered sugar n nLocated on the corner of trendy East Fremont and Las Vegas Boulevard, with raves received from hipsters since its inception, it was just minutes before noon that I sat down with a friend for lunch at Park on Fremont and although I'm happy to say the service far outperformed similar spots in Chicago, Brooklyn, or Portland the food itself left much to be desired a seemingly well culled menu instead proving limited in not only options but quality of execution, as well. Clearly the sort of place where cuisine is considered less important than booze and d u00e9cor suffice it to say that the beer list and creative cocktails far outnumber the options for food and even with the extended brunch menu it was only in three items that myself and a friend could muster enough interest to indulge, the plates arriving in two rounds as we sat amidst a room awash in faux taxidermy and paintings ranging from humping animals to possessed children with neither rhyme nor reason to be found. Opting for one starter to precede a duo of entrees it would not be long before the best bites of the meal would arrive and served as a quintet the Mac Cheese balls each proved not only sizable but also quite delicate, the crackling panko overlying supple pasta with briny bits of bacon imbuing each bite plus a sidecar of cheese sauce for those desiring even more cream. At this point happily conversing about recent events as background music played on it was after only the slightest of delays that three trays would arrive and with the kitchen opting to split our French Toast while the sandwich was served whole it can only be said that neither dish tasted as good as it looked, the brioche too lightly soaked and thinly sliced to allow the exterior to be rendered crisp without burning it while the waffle was chewy and lifeless, a bready detriment to otherwise pleasant chicken and bacon served alongside entirely forgettable, yet all too trendy, 'tots.' n nNot exactly a disaster in that the service was pleasant while the Mac Cheese Balls were far better than standard pub grub suffice it to say that for those not interested in being upsold on cleverly named cocktails or craft beers Park on Fremont has little to offer a quick walk down the street to MTO, eat, S O, Carson Kitchen, or DuPar's offering far more extensive selection with equal or better value on the dollar at each.",1
"I get that this place is a lounge and not a club but that being said, it's a LOT smaller than I expected. For a small lounge, you'd think it'd be packed. No, it was pretty dead when I went and based on everyone else's reviews, it's pretty dead on more than one occasion. n nI guess being dead serves us well considering we had a group of 15 with 8 of them being guys. We had no problem getting the guys in but I'm guessing the club figured, better to have guys in the lounge than no people at all. n nI guess I was expecting a lot considering it's Vegas and everything is always overdone here. I like the REVOLUTION sign that spells LOVE on the other side but honestly other than that, I don't think I'd come back here again.",1
"I've been eating here for many years. And the only thing I ever eat is the Chicken with vegetables. It's delicious. The people are friendly, the food is reasonably priced. I always take out and have never dined in. Nothing much bad to say about this place. But I tend to like my food spicy, and they tend to be very stingy on giving away their chili pepper oil. I swear to you I made myself four little containers of chili oil and set them on the counter to have the lady place them in the bag. And when I came home there was only 2 in the bag. If they really don't want to give their chili up maybe they should start charging, I would gladly pay so I don't feel guilty just cause I like my food a little spicier than most. But overall I'd recommend this place.",2
"Nothing less than 1 star? Progressive doesn't even deserve that! Let me express how deeply disgusted I am with Progressive Auto Insurance. They want to hold me accountable for an accident that didn't even occur! Even after I took time out of my day to drive across town so their inspectors could laugh at the lack of damage on my car, even ask ME where the damage was, they still want to say I hit some crazy woman's car and pay her out so they can raise my rates. It's ridiculous how they'll just roll over on their customers like that. Then, to top it off, they won't even supply me with ""photographs "" or ""witness statements "" I'm positive she flipped the guy a 20 because the only other vehicle around at the time was behind me and they didn't even bother to call that person or any proof! They don't want to talk to me anymore now that they've made their decision. Their claim service is a joke and provides way too much personal information. I was able to find out the claimant's full name, other people's names included in the claim, year, make, and model of the car which was not the car that I supposedly hit . All of this from some made up claim to get money. Social media has never made it easier to locate people. I just pray they aren't as lax with my information, this woman could come after me for more money! I will be changing insurance companies for sure! I can't believe they let people take advantage of their customers like this. I tell everyone never to use Progressive because you'll pay every month for a ton of hype and when you need them to be in your corner, they'll roll over for an opportunity to raise your rates. DISGUSTING! Stay tuned, I'm sure I'll be posting updates as this fiasco continues to unfold.",1

"Great place for hiking the trails are pretty clear and there are lots of them! Only wish there were bathroom facilities near the entrance to the trails. Also, the raptor center is pretty cool took my son a couple of years ago and will be taking him again this year now that he's a little older. Other than that, haven't really done any of the tours or horseback riding, but a great place for an outing with the kids!",2
"This is a great spot for casual dining if you like the ""Vegas "" showmanship . n nI have dined here a dozen times in the past two years. The food is very consistent. I strongly recommend you sit at the bar if you are dining alone. This is the Venetian so a lot of interesting people especially those from Italy will eat here. Makes the whole dining experience that much more authentic. n nThe ambiance is OK. I spend a third of my year in Vegas so I'm tired of the theme concept. Tourist will probably find the ambiance enchanting. n nThe service is very friendly. n nThe food is very good. Try a selection of cheeses or some of the cured meats to start. Salads are a great choice if you have not had your greens but you can make them yourself at home. They are not special. The restaurant shines in its homemade pasta preparations. They are ALL excellent. I never thought cauliflower would make a great pasta topping. I was so wrong. Other entre items are well prepared but not that memorable. n nWines are also a great buy here. They offer a large number of wines by the glass. The typical pour is a quarter of the bottle. Prices are very fair. n nIf you have room, enjoy some biscotti with an Italian desert wine they offer very good choices. Perfect end to the evening.",2
After a rough week of work. Laughter will ease all pains. Thats what I got. After 2 hours. Life is good again. Had a massage earlier today and this was truly the perfect ending to the day. It was announced his show will end in 2 weeks. Vegas will miss this show. See it before its gone people. Good laughs. I'm gonna try to repeat a lot of them going forward,2
I will never go to this place again! My family and I have tried to come here.key word TRIED several times n they are always closed or just closed hours before the time indicated online. They claim they are a family owned business n when business is dead they close early so there for they need to indicate that online. Needless to say that will be my 3rd n last time trying to eat at this family owned business. Good luck running business like that!,1

"Was lured into this place by the 10.00 t bone dinner. Called ahead to see if they were still open and if they still had the special. The person on the phone said the special was still available. Upon ordering, the waiter said they had ran out of the special and I asked if they'd substitute another thing, like prime rib for the same price. They said it wasn't possible, so i asked if they could talk to management. He said management wasn't around, but we could try again later. We order the prime rib, then ask if management had an answer. Waiter said management could do nothing to substitute the prime rib, even when we tried to explain how we called ahead, offering to show the waiter our call log. It's unfortunate that in such a hospitable place as the Green Valley Ranch Resort that management could not accommodate us. Such a shame considering everything else about this resort has been absolute perfection. The dinner was delicious nonetheless.",1
"The lines were long, the wait was long, but I guess it was worth it? nMy friends loved this place, and so did I kind of . I wasn't feeling too hot, and so I didn't get to grub like a beast like I would usually do. nOne of my friends signed up for a card w the hotel, and he got a free 10 play certificate for redemption and got 1 off per person who ate at the buffet with him. Sweet! Dinner buffet is 45. n nFor those who like home designs etc, in line if you look at the lights you'll notice that cups were used as the design around the lights. Looks pretty nice. n nThe lines were super long for the seafood section. Right behind that was the meat section. My friends feasted in both sections, especially in the seafood section. They were animals. There were also Mexican food and Chinese and so on. If you like dessert, it's in a different section separate from the buffet right in the middle of the restaurant. My stomach was hurting so I didn't really try any of it, but my friends did and loved it. Some went back for seconds, and thirds. Crazy.",2
"We ate here last night based on the yelp reviews I read. The atmosphere is super cool with blue lights, very modern and minimalistic. Nice spacing between tables. We were there early in the evening, so it wasn't busy at all. Besides a single rail drink costing 7.00, everything was very good tasting and the portions were nice. Scallops entree was excellent. The waitress was extra sweet, asking the cooks for egg drop soup for my Dad, when its usually not available on weekends. I'd definitely eat here again.",2
"If you're in the mood for food then this is not the place to go since you will never be served. We waited almost 40 minutes longer than we'd usually wait but we were having good conversation with barely a ""drive by "" from our waitress. Got one ""the sushi will be out soon "" after a dirty look from me. Got no refills on water or iced tea. nGot up an left and all the waitress could say was ""sorry "" as she was breezing past us with food for a table that showed up AFTER us. nWe will not be going back.",1
"I like this place, a lot. So sue me. Good, urban location, yet plenty of parking for us mis placed suburbanites. I don't think the prices are too out of line, given the upscale nature of the place. We have fun trying to figure out which movie they're playing on the TVs, what is the best way to sit on the oddly shaped stools at the bar who would think straddling them is the best? so uncomfortable! and pretending to have never tasted the White Rabbit drink sugar tastic . Usually a pretty good crowd here, always a good time. nDownsides no real food, Pandora playlist then there's no dj that works great for work, but kinda iffy at a bar , the line for the men's washroom. seriously.",2

"I have been dealing with this PostalMax for about 3 years now. I only use them for shipping because of their convenience to the work I do for one of my clients in the shopping center. I have always found the owner somewhat cold and borderline rude but being easy going myself, I just let it slide. I never sweat the small stuff. nBut yesterday, Mike, the owner, crossed the line. I just had a very expensive, time sensitive shipment that was brought over for FedEx pickup. When I drop off my shipments, they are boxed, labeled and ready for the FedEx driver to scan and pickup. As always, when I drop off, as a courtesy to the PostalMax staff, I acknowledge that I am leaving the parcel. Today, Mike got very upset when I did the drop off. nWhen I could not get tracking from FedEx by the following morning, I returned to PostalMax. There sat my time critical shipment right where I left it the night before. Per our conversation, Mike told me that he told the Fedex driver not to take the box. Furthermore, he told me that he was not going to tender the parcel to Fedex until I returned. Fortunately, I did return in the morning and removed the parcel and shipped it at a FedEx Kinko's. nBecause of the spiteful and irresponsible actions of this PostalMax, my time sensitive shipment is going to arrive late. nI do not recommend this facility to anyone looking for a shipping",1
"My dining partner was absolutely angry after getting his order. First of all, he said he wanted to go in, instead of going through the drive thru, because he wanted to MAKE SURE they got his order right. But, no.

"The best deck in the burgh, for the gay bars anyway. Great bar though, the food has gotten better recently, and the drinks are always good. Its a good time, and a good place to hang out in the community. Very friendly staff and ownership. Who also really supports the community.",2
I've been a fan of the original Red Velvet Cafe since it opened. I knew they had opened this location but really just stumbled upon it at the mall. It was a nice surprise since I wasn't looking for it. It's a great place to catch a break from shopping and feel like you are tucked away underneath the escalators. It seems to be primary their dessert selection in the case with some sandwiches and salads and a scaled down order menu from their original location. Of course my two favorite items are priced a little higher then the original location but that didn't stop me from getting my cookie fix.,2
"Location great, food very average for a Top Chef run restaurant. The employees, and management seem distraught, miserable and unprofessional. and it shows. Don't expect to see the same server or manager there the next time you go because the retention is appalling. The little secret too is that they actually charge you 1 cent for water and hide the cost within the bill. Call them out on this people! Typical money hungry, mafia run greed.supporting a place like this is a travesty, shame on Town Sq too for not doing the research on the owner who is not exactly an exemplary Las Vegas citizen.look it up. Good luck.you need more than you're doing to save your ""balls ""!",1
"overpriced drinks, rude staff. they kicked me out because I wore a hat. I'm sorry, if hats were forbidden then you shouldn't have let me in with one. I'd rather go to a straight bar",1
"I normally would go to the Summerlin Best Buy but, they were out of Apple lightning USB charger cables so I went to the next closest one which is this store. Worst Best Buy I've ever been to. Workers seem to have absolutely no urgency to help customers. When I went to check out they always ask if you have a Best Buy rewards account, the guy at the register didn't ask so I asked him to please enter my info he said that's a stupid program. I won't be going back to that store ever!",1
"On July 17, 2014 my boyfriend and I rented a 2014 convertible mustang to drive down the coast with the top down to San Francisco to celebrate our 6 year anniversary. Upon arrival to HERTZ McCarren location the lady behind the counter never looked up at us or make eye contact during the entire transaction. She then said in a nasty tone ""CAN I HELP YOU ""? I told her we have a reservation under and gave her my last name. She found the reservation and ask for I.D. and a credit card. I presented all she ask for no problem. Again she never even looked at me so I could have given her a license of a dog and she would not have known the difference. Anyway, I told her I'm adding another driver. She told me it would be 11.00 dollars a day to add another driver. i informed her that I just rented a care from you earlier this year and added a driver and it didn't cost a thing, She pretty much called me liar and said ""it's been that way for 3 years so there is no way you added someone for free "". I did not want to get into it with this rude lady so i told her I'm not going to argue with you lady over this. Maybe the prices are different because its at the airport. She said nothing and again not making eye contact continued punching away on the computer. After all was said and done She said the keys are inside the car. I ask her ok where do we go? Again without looking up she pointed to the escalator behind us and said ""take those up and walk out the door and look for the car "". So we went up the escalator and walked outside and the car was right in front of us which was a good thing. However, as we approached the car, I noticed how very very very dirty the outside of the car was and the interior was even worse. The windows were soooo dirty and the mirrors I had to stop at a gas station and clean them just so I could see. And the car had a card on the steering wheel that read ""YOUR VEHICLE HAS BEEN CLEANED AND CERTIFIED SAFE TO DRIVE "". This was the worse experience I have ever had with a rental car company. I went on there website and filed a complaint 3 times already and have not received a phone call or email from corporate. I STRONGLY advice anyone DO NOT USE HERTZ AT ANY LOCATION FOR YOUR CAR RENTAL NEEDS. WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.",1
Might be my new favorite Thai place. Try the crispy pad Thai! Thai tea is super yummy. And the spring rolls! I'll definitely be back.,2
"OMG. Hit the restroom prior to ordering. It smelled so bad from long term lack of cleaning that I was afraid to order food. I mentioned it to my husband, who had just returned from the men's room. He said the same thing. We left.feared that the kitchen cleanliness was of the same caliber. Come on guys.a little Lysol and elbow grease goes a long way.",1
"No Vegas trip is complete without a trip to Earl's, period. No, it's not the best thing I've ever eaten, but it's a pretty darn good sandwich and for the price, I can think of little else comparably good on the Strip. n nThe bread is what makes the sandwich it's warm, crusty and is the right denseness to hold the ingredients together and still be satisfying but not heavy. n nThe big debate among our group is whether the Full Montagu or the Original is the superior sandwich. You certainly get more flavors with the Montagu, but I LOVE horseradish. Such a hard choice. n nThe line is Earl's downside, even though it goes pretty quick. But if it is especially bad, you can avoid it by ordering the sandwich over the phone and gamble or stop by the ABC store around the corner for a few minutes. Then head to the front of the line past everyone waiting to pay!",2
"Yup, believe the hype and rating, this place is definitely worth trying. Made a reservation and at 6pm they had seats available still on the patio where the view is definitely worth the wait if there was one. n nI went with the french onion soup which was pretty good, though would've preferred if it had a crispier crouton on top instead of something a little too mushy. That was pretty much my only complaint with this place. n nFor the main meal I had the steak bordelaise and I was very happy. Huge portion, steak cooked nice and rare, great sauce, and the frites were very good. n nIf you're in town and looking for a very reasonably priced dinner that will leave you full, this is definitely the spot. I just wish we weren't in a rush to make our show time, otherwise I would've happily stayed for dessert.",2
"While I was home in Idaho, a new restaurant was opening, called Cafe Rio. Being Twin Falls, Idaho, a sleepy little town, this was a BIG deal. Lines were out the door, but my sister and I decided to brave the crowd. nI was so glad we did. n nFast forward one month to my first paycheck back in Phoenix, and my roommate and I are cruising along past Phoenix. Tempe. Mesa. and find ourselves in Gilbert, for the sole purpose of getting a salad. n nNow, this is not just any salad, but it is one of the most delicious taco salads I have ever had. Lettuce, tortilla strips, cojita cheese, rice, beans, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and meat of your choice pork barbacoa. ALWAYS choose the pork barbacoa! nestled in a warm tortilla that was made right before your eyes, then drizzled in the house creamy cilantro dressing. Uh mazing. n nI can only testify to this one dish however. Or I suppose the tostada. exact same, except instead of the flour tortilla, a small corn tortilla . The first time I went I got the quesadilla with chile roasted beef. It was okay. I wouldn't have been back if it wasn't for me trying my sister's salad, which we have established is enough for me to spend my finite resources on cash, gas . The service here also leaves a bit to be desired, but whatever. I'm not here for the ambiance although some very nice art pieces , or the clientele lots of families , or the reading material The Beehive . nThey do have a customer loyalty card buy 10 meals get 1 free which seems to be a dying art these days, which is just too bad, because Cafe Rio has made a loyal customer out of me!",2
The food was delicious. The crispy potatoes pancakes with the sauce are so yummy. The braised beef with cabbage and sauteed vegetables are juicy and plump. The hurricane drink is a panty dropper. You dont notice how strong it is until your already gone. Lol. great food. Great service.,2
"This place always has a dj in the evenings, there is a tiny dance floor and usually cheap drink specials. n nGenerally I disliked this place, the blue moon I ordered seemed to be watered down and hence gross. They do offer it for 3 everyday, all day. My friend said it might have been at the bottom of the keg, idk if bottom of the keg beer is generally sub par but my drink was. I really hope my friends do not take me here again.",1
"Made my reservation online for 26 a day. 4 days. Total with taxes was 160. Took an upgrade for 10 bucks a day to a suburban. GREAT vehicle. Got my bill, it was for 250! Questioned it when I turned the car in and they blamed it on 37 taxes. I'm late for a flight so I don't argue, I'll figure it out when I get home sweet home. Well, I ""m currently on hold with the airport location who transferred me 12 times! Enterprise is associated with Alamo see my review on them so it all makes sense to me now. It's not worth the hassle to save a few bucks, go with Hertz I'm told, I'll let ya know ",1
"Terrible. Absolutely worthless. This restaurant is so HAS BEEN they don't even maintain the neon sign above the entrance. n nMenu that looks to be 5 years old has items x'd out with a Sharpie. Yes, a magic marker. n nNo art on the wall indicative of owner change and new owners being under financed. It's sad and depressing. n nLikely not remodelled since the casino originally opened in 1990 this is a MUST PASS. n nDoesn't even have old Vegas charm. Just old, outdated and in need of closure.",1
"Quick and friendly service! If you love spicy food, order 73 and add extra spicy paste they give you! Its really good! But I do wish that the bowls were bigger!",2
"This Place is HORRIBLE. n nWe stayed here because it is part of the Harrahs family of hotels and Ceasars was sold out do to some big convention. Checked into the room, and noticed the doors had been broken off of the closet, the Window was the size of a peep hole, the room smelled, and I had to call the operator to ask if there was a rollercoaster at the hotel because it sounded like there was one right over our room. When I called down to ask for a room change, there was never an answer from the front desk I was on hold for 20 mins . I finally just went down to the front desk where the nightmare continued. Finally after 20 mins of bickering, we were placed in a new room, when the conversation started, there were no different rooms but one must have magically appeared . The service at this hotel is downright AWFUL. Upon checkout, I called the valet to have the car pulled up.Nope, can't do that, have to go down to the stand before they will grab your car. The toilet in the new room was broken and the list just goes on and on with this place. n nOn a different note, the poker room was great because the clientele who stay here are generally drunk by 11AM so it was easy money at the tables. That alone brought it from one star to Two",1
Incompetent reps taking phone orders. Couldn't get my order correct after 4 tries. I told them they need to get someone competent on the phone taking taking orders.,1
Be forewarned they charge a fortune! I went in for a simple manicure pedicure and the bill came to 100. All for a nail bar! Question whether they sterilize their equipment. I could have gotten a better service at a top end spa. Unbelievable rip off. I will never be back.,1
"Food 4 stars nService 4 stars nAtmosphere 4 stars n nThe burgers are outstanding! The bartenders are friendly and the drink menu is really good. I recommend trying the french fries cooked in duck fat. Yummy goodness! n nIt's a little more expensive than your average burger joint, but it wont break the bank and it's worth the money. n nCheck it out and you'll be satisfied.",2
"Okay, the food, if not able to feed entire armies, is on the delicious side, but unimaginative. They give fancy names to tired dishes, and the menu is as big as the portions. n nThe service Did they purchase their waiters from a vending machine? I wanted a dish that had fried tofu. When I asked if I could have the tofu steamed instead, the server's expression was quizzical to say the least, and she then tried to illicit a description of this ""steaming "" method. Or did she not know what tofu is? Silly. She then had to crawl through a chain of command, from chef to manager, to make it happen. Hello? You have about 9000 dishes on your menu I'm sure SOMEONE asks for a substitution SOMEWHERE? n nAll in all, I remain unimpressed. More like the Grand Sucks Cafe.",1
Burgers are nothing special! Fries are super soggy! Not worth the hype! nService was great,1
"I've been here 2 times, once alone, and once on a boyfriend totally messed up so ordering the most expensive dish on the menu is a must, and I didn't like anything either time. The food was mostly bland and average, and I commented on the tomato sauce having come straight out of the Sysco can and onto my pasta. The service was sluggish, and dare I say I felt the server was hating on us for being straight? This is probably the most off putting part of our whole experience this also has happened countless times at Fez, but I digress . Seriously. n nI think the decor's trying a little too hard to be something it most obviously is not they should actually stick to being a neighborhood Italian joint, instead of the cheeseball fake plants and Italian ""stuff "" everywhere , but the oil and herbs combo at the beginning is a welcome touch and probably the only reason I'm going with 2 stars instead of 1. n nDoubtful I'll be back here alone or with boyfriend.",1
"We were in Charlotte this past weekend and we were in the mood for Italian, so we went to Mama Ricotta's. I am glad we made the choice to come here. From the moment we walked in, the staff was pretty friendly and accommodating. We got the Burrata Prosciutto appetizer, it was lovely. Our entrees were Penne Alla Vodka and Rigatoni with Meat Sauce. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful just like Italian food should be. n nWe noticed that the dessert portions were enormous so we asked if we could be served just half of a tiramisu. Our waitress was absolutely accommodating and she made it happen. We weren't expecting to pay half price for the dessert we just didn't want the rest to go to waste, but she did charge us half price. I wish this place was in DC, we would be here all the time.",2
"4 1 2 stars! Our prior stay in Vegas was at the Luxor nice place but waaaaaaay too far out on the start of the strip so for our two night couples trip to Las Vegas for 03 14 weekend we chose The Mirage and loved this place. Stayed in a regular king sized room and it was the perfect size, very clean and nicely decorated. I'm sure you can find a fancier room in other hotels but this is a great place at a very decent price, plus great location on the strip. The entire hotel is very pretty. Lots of plants and flowers. The general pool area is huge and relaxing seperate from Bare pool party area . Volcano show is cool and buffett was pricey but food was good. Didnt eat at any of the restaurants there but there's definitely options to choose from. nThere was an incident as we were checking in where another guest was making a huge scene and getting angry with the staff his problem had nothing to do with the hotel but with the cab driver who drove him there . anyway, the young lady who was assisting us was not only very nice before the incident but apologized several times afterwards and gave each of our rooms 3 rooms a 25 credit because we had to witness the uncomfortable moment. Not much but I thought it was nice of her because it wasnt something she HAD to do. I will definitely be back to the Mirage!",2
I have been here two times and I have not been too impressed with the food. The only thing I liked was the pancakes. super good! But I also got the biscuits and gravy and was not impressed. The second time I got their chicken and waffles. I asked if they had hashbrowns and they didn't what breakfast place doesn't have hashbrowns? Our server did say they had little crispy potatoes? So I tried that and man am I mad for spending three dollars on them. No salt and no flavor! Even dipping it in ketchup didn't help. The chicken was alright and the waffles were good. I tried this place a couple times and have just not been impressed. Probably won't be back.,1
"A group of us stopped by Q Studio after a delicious dinner at Echo Rig. It was dark with music thumping, neon lights stringed at different areas. There is also painting of Tupac, Biggie, and Snoop. Looks like they are still trying to figure out their identity. n nThe room had a weird smell to it. It was kind of dirty. Though there are a variety of songs in different language to chose from, I could not find any songs that I want to sing or try to sing . There were three binders of music, and they were all different. It would be more convenient if all the songs were in one binder, and there were three binders so that a big group can filter through. n nWe all used our check in offer to get a bottle of H2O. They also provided us with a bowl of veggie stix. It was untouched. n nAnd the videos are the worst part. Regardless of what song you chose to sing, you are bound to see the same video behind those lyrics. Not cool. n nOverall, the staff is friendly but due to the many cons, I don't believe I will return.",1
"After browsing Yelp reviews and pictures, we didn't have a high hope, but decided to consider our breakfast as a ticket to enter this property. n nAs expected, our waffles and pancakes were mediocre. Service was slow. My waffles came without maple syrup, and when I pointed that out, the server said we could share my wife's syrup that came in a tiny espresso cup sized container. WHAT? He immediately realized his mistake and gave me another one, but he shouldn't have said such a ridiculous thing in the first place. n nHot tea came without the lid on the pot. Paint on the chairs was worn off. Lack of attention to details was observed everywhere. And 40 for two, for all that. n nSorry, Donald. If that's your definition of luxury, I'm disappointed.",1
Came here to celebrate a special event. Decided on Grotto because of the reviews but couldn't be disappointed more. Rude and disrespectful owner server who was very judgmental. We ended up leaving due to his demeanor and treatment. Want a similar experience? Make reservations and enter at your own risk.,1
We missed Harvest moon but wanted to try this new place. I ordered the Fried hot chicken Sammy. Oh My God! It was just amazing. It was so full of flavor that I relished each and every bite. There was no conversation during this lunch since everyone was lost in their food. nAMAZING!,2
"I was visiting friends in the PHX area and they suggested having dinner drinks at The Yard it was also their first time attending. n nFirst off, the valet parking is great granted, we went on a Monday night, so not all that busy I know some complained that the lot filled up I would imagine that would be the case on weekends . n nWe sat outside, which on most Arizona evenings is a must it was extremely comfortable and open, and there is a roof that will protect you from any 'weather' though in my brief stay there wasn't so much a cloud. Must be nice! n nOur waitress was quirky but this is a quirky'ish restaurant and was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We all got a different selection of beers I had the Moose Drool, which is I believe. a Montana brewed beer, and one that I had been recommended by others after I saw this, I sort of lost focus on the rest of the draught selection, but I think there was a good rotation of local and seasonal brews. n nWe split the pretzels w fondue as an appetizer 12 bite sized pretzel cubes there was nothing incredible about them, but they were a fine compliment to our beers. I followed that up with a butternut squash cannelloni although, I'm not Italian, but I don't think this was cannelloni more like ravioli that was really tasty, and surprising how flavorful and well done considering that The Yard comes across as being more pub food centric. The other folks got the pub food a burger and grilled cheeses w bacon everyone seemed pleased. n nThe Yard gets an extra star for the free entertainment. Again, I would imagine that the whole situation would be MUCH different on the weekend, but on a Monday night it was easy to play a game of cornhole with beer in hand they also have table shuffleboard and ping pong and not have to wait or feel cramped. It's a great place to go with friends to catch up and have a good time, and I was really appreciative of the fact that we weren't forced to close out our tab with the waitress even after getting up after the meal to play the games she came over and let us continue adding to our check. n nI would definitely re visit next time I'm in the area.",2
"It was 6 of us in my party 4 adults 2 children . My bro and his family took for ever to order but the employee kept his cool and patience! He was even doing some tricks with the ice cream for my nieces. So we got a lil show from him, it sucks that I didnt get his name. It was over 40 for 6 signiture ice creams 3 with waffle cones . . .I was very surprised that the restroom was extremely clean! nSo why the 4 stars instead of the 5? Well, the chocolate waffles were very stale so we all threw them away once we finished the ice cream. Also, we ate the ice cream inside the place but they only had three tables available 2 persons per table so we couldn't sit together. They do have another table that sits four next to the entrance. So a total of 10 ppl can enjoy the ice cream in here but it would be very uncomfortable if the place was packed since its a small location.",2
"Didn't really want to patronize the usual breakfast buffets in the hotels, so my husband and I set out to find a local breakfast spot that we'd really enjoy. Boy did we find it!The banana nut muffin was probably the best I've ever had! Everything on the menu looked good so we really had a difficult time placing an order. However, I ended up with the enchilada omlette which was devine and my husband had a chili omlette and he loved his as well. We were stuffed by the time we were done and promised ourselves we would return once again before we ended our vacation.",2
"The staff is friendly and attentive. Too bad the food is so limited and not too impressive. There's some good items, but there's better places not to far for the same price point.",1
"3 stars for the place, 2 stars for the food. nBeen to a few different fro yo places in the Valley, and this one seemed kind of similar in look very clean and bright inside with light green color and tasting cups. Main downside the selection of flavors was unexciting. Most places have at least a few that I really like. Here, none really stood out. I got the Red Velvet Cake at last and not very much of it, at that . The spoons have a little character with a animal figure on top, they have free water in a dispenser with cups, and they actually have restrooms, which other places don't have. This place isn't near me, but I wouldn't go back even if it were. Not recommended.",1
You can come here for happy hour drinks but do not under any circumstances eat dinner here.,1
Let's hype it up and then not show up. n nWhy exist when you only have six people show up on a Saturday night in the summer?,1
No where near worth the price. They seem afraid to season the food. it all tasted flat. The biscuits I could get at a local breakfast diner. No plans to ever go back and wouldn't recommend it to a friend.,1
This review is for the cheesesteak only. nThe location itself is kind of hard to find. Look for the gas station and towards the back. nMy classmates and I came here during lunch and there was no wait. We all opted for the half cheesesteak fries lunch combo for around 5. It took them awhile to serve us but it was well worth the wait. Good thing I picked 1 2 since it was the size of my arm! maybe subway can learn a thing or two . I honestly couldn't finish the whole thing off. Delicious steak covered in melted cheese and saut u00e9ed onions and mushroom delicious! Couldn't have asked for more.,2
"Everything went well. Nice, comfortable atmosphere. The Doc knew what she was doing, even pointed out and old scar on my eye that I had never been alerted to previously! Didn't get the actual hardware there kinda pricey . Would recommend to anyone!",2
"Portillo's in Chicago is a MUST. Portillo's in Arizona, meh. Scottsdale location better than Tempe location, and I only say this because you can taste that lovely Tempe waste tap water taste in the food.",1
"What a sad little buffet. Checked it out around 1pm on a Monday and there wasn't much left. No eggrolls and most of the dishes were almost gone or had been there a long time. I was the only one in the restaurant besides an attentive waitress who refilled my water a few times, and a young male employee who had his head down at a table I think I was interrupting his sleep. You might have better luck ordering off the menu, but steer clear of the buffet. n nNote to Nicole G It IS possible to have fresh buffet food that's edible. Nobody is expecting perfection.",1
Cool place on a hot summer day,2
"This place is located in a sketchy part of Las Vegas, but nevertheless, it's really legit. Me and my family accidentally stumbled upon this place and come every chance we're in the city. n nThey have delicious pre made foods like larb ground beef salad , salty bamboo salad yum nomai , nem kao kind of like a fried rice , and all kinds of sauces like cheo bong spicy sauce. My favorite are the homemade pork beef jerky and the fresh sausages that they make. The best thing is that they sell sticky rice hot in little ziploc baggies. n nThey also sell fresh produce, snacks, drinks, frozen items, and canned jar items. It's a mini grocery store that also sells really great food. They also have chairs and tables in the back where you can sit after asking them to warm the soups or food up for you. n nJust be aware of how much you're racking up, though. Although things are a reasonable 5 6 that can last you about two meals, we usually spend over 100 there. n nDefinitely recommend going and giving them a try. They speak great english and, if you speak it, they speak laotian too! Most delicious food other than momma'a cooking there is out there. It's like a taste of home, smack dab in the middle of downtown Las Vegas.",2
"Sadly, the quality of the ice has gone way down. I ordered lemon ice. It was more like icey old water. Nary a bit of lemon to it. I hope it was a fluke bc I have previously loved Rita's.",1
"I had Hank do a one time cleanup to get our house ready for sale. I didn't feel that the services performed were equal to the price he charged, and I felt like we were taken advantage of. For example, he recommended ripping out several boxwood bushes that had gone dormant from the freeze and replacing with some more colorful plants, so we gave the ok. When we saw the pathetic plants he replaced them with we were pretty disappointed, then noticed that our neighbors' boxwoods were growing back within a month or so we wish he would have just left them in and trimmed down instead of ripping them out . A few other things weren't done to our satisfaction, and I just feel like it wasn't a good value.",1
"I wanted to try this place out because I'm a huge fan of the motion picture film Blade Runner. Normally I don't need to get my hair cut. I'm genetically blessed with smart hair follicles that sense when my appearance needs a tweak and they automatically put themselves in order. I have noticed that it is usually a lesser grade of human that requires this hair cutting nonsense. nHaving recently moved to the area , I decided that despite my superior genetic make up, I would try and relate to the little people and get my ""hairs cut "". nMy girlfriend and I walked in, we were not greeted at the desk. Not even so much as a glance in our direction. I know that we are both very intimidating, its obvious that these people have never been confronted by two more perfect specimens of both genders. I could go on but i wont. nI'm sure its a swell place, but if you are under the age of 400 and may have additional things to do in your 24 hour period, you may want to try elsewhere. nP.S. some creepy dude with open toed sandals was just sitting in one of the chairs reading a magazine. Get a pedicure you monster,.gross.",1
"Gotta agree, staff isn't the most upbeat. Seemed annoyed when I mentioned, Yelp listed them closed. Sandwhich was good, better thank Quiznos. Wish they had more veggie topping options. I had the chicken salad on pumpernickle. Very generous sized sandwhich for price.",1
"Wow. What can I say, we love this place. Tammy rocks. This is the only place we eat sushi. Fresh and delicious. We love the Napolean Dynamite. FABULOUS. Drinks are really good. I'm hooked on the Atomic Tea and I hate lemon in my tea . That's how good it is. Go and experience.",2
"I wanted to try something new, so I decided to visit Macaroni Grill with a friend of mine who ate there before. nThe waiter brought us some bread, I forgot what the name of the bread was but it was very hard on the outside. I ordered chicken parmigiana. The chicken was ok, the sauce was ok, but the noodles were the realllyyy skinny ones and i didn't like those at alll. I don't think i'll be going back here anytime soon. n nWell, at least it wasn't that busy, the INSIDE of the bread was good lol, and the waiter was really nice.",1
"Okay. so who in the hell took away their happy pills. and who is the hell decided that a TSA Clerk or whatever they are called could preach to me about Jesus. n nMy friend and I had a wonderful 4 days 3 nights stay in Las Vegas at the New York New York. We met wonderful people everywhere we went. we are very easy to get along with. we are funny and fun. We tip well. very well we smile A LOT, we say simple things like excuse me or pardon me when we are trying to pass someone or even if someone bangs into us. We got good service everywhere we went. honestly we are easy! So why my rant. n nWell thank God this was at the end of the trip. We made it through three security checks. count em 3 a big 3 but when we got to the last little part. 1 min to go before we were able to go to our gate the BITCH and a few other choice words that I have for her was having a very very very bad day. Like I said. don't take happy pills away from fools who only make min wage. it ain't good. don't give power to fools who only make min wage even a worse idea. Decided to throw the bins at my friend while she was trying to take off her shoes, plus load her carry on bags into one of those gray trays, and all my friend said was ""Please may I have a few moments "". the BITCH wouldn't let anyone else move forward or backwards and made a LOUD announcement that the line was basically being held up because ""THIS LADY needs a FEW MOMENTS "". I was appalled and I said ""Jesus lady let us go "" ""you didn't need to hit her "". that's when I got the lecture that I did not accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. WTF. I told her to not talk to me anymore. and yet she kept talking. again I must add. GIVE the BITCH back her HAPPY PILLS. Soooooo long story short when we finally got through the line to collect our bags and we complained to the Supervisor she said. and I quote. ""I know exactly who you are talking about. she has been like that ALL DAY "". WTF n nPS. Don't say Jesus or a form there off to a short Mexican lady at the Las Vegas TSA junction. just a word of advice from one Yelper to another",1
"Dinner with relatives six adults. Had reservations at 5 pm and were seated promptly. Then our waiter spent 15 minutes detailing every pizza on the menu.duh, like we couldn't read them for ourselves. He fawned over the menu until we were sick of him and just wanted to order. First came our salads, which he insisted we get. All I can say is yuk. They just were weird and not that good for the price. n nThen he disappeared. Two non english speaking girls brought our pizzas, but wouldn't take our six dirty salad plates and utensils. What fun it is to eat your main course with dirty dishes all over the table. Our waiter had GUARANTEED us that the pizzas would be the best we had ever eaten. Meh. I've had better at NYPD Pizza. n nBut what really ticked me off is that we could get no refills on beverages, no dirty dishes cleared, and nobody would get me a clean fork to eat my calzone. For this price I think I'm entitled to a clean utensil. Yes, the menu states that parties 6 or more will have gratuity automatically added. I'm cool with that, except that at Cibo's that means ""after we take your order we don't have to offer you any more service, and we still get our 20 . "" n nI'd never go back. Just wasn't worth the .",1
"I prearranged a dinner event for 10 with a quasi pre fixe menu and beer or whiskey pairing. When we arrived the table was setup in a semi private room which was nice but the general manager Mark and the Cicerone manager Russell were not present. I expected at least one of them would have been there to say hello or greet us. No big deal though and we went and sat down. Our waiter then brings menus by and starts going over a few things and I told him that we had a prearranged menu with beer whiskey pairing and he had absolutely no idea about it whatsoever. Great.Luckily I had my email chain with the beer and whiskey pairings and we got it somewhat sorted out other than the fact that 2 of the beers we had put on the list they were out of. Ugh. The hits just kept coming. Our server did a good job handling the debacle that was no fault of his own but he did seem at times to be either annoyed by us or just wanted to get our table handled quickly since he knew he would get 18 guaranteed since our party was large. n nOn to the food n nPoutine Solid dish and we added the fried egg on top. nOctopus Another good appetizer but it didn't wow me. I would go with the poutine over this all day but the contrast between the two was nice. nBeet Salad My favorite dish on the list. Great flavor and fresh beets. nPork Chop This was recommended to me and it was sadly overcooked which is the last thing you ever want with pork. The dish had promise but was prepared incorrectly. nFries Standard shoestring fries, good but nothing special. n nBeer and Whiskey nThe beer selection was sadly disappointing. I have been to many other places that don't even focus on craft beers that have a larger selection. We had the Big Trout Slayer and the Grimbergem Blonde with the appetizers. n nI went with the whiskey pairing with the main dish and I really enjoyed it. I am glad I decided to go that route versus the smaller beer selection, many of which were easy to find and get at home. n nOverall, the food was a 3.5 or 4 but the lack of organization for a planned group over a month in advance and a limited beer selection for a place that prides itself on that was sadly disappointing. The service overall was okay but again there were times when I thought he was ""inconvenienced "" by us. I want to say I would give it another shot but I don't know.",1
"We have been coming here for over three years and while the service has been up and down, the food has stayed at a 4 star level. We have had just about everything on the menu between myself, my wife and our daughter, There have been some misses, but after reading some of the negative reviews before me, I wonder what standards these people are applying. It is a chain burrito place, not Pampano in NY. Yes they still only take cash, but they have an ATM. Like any place you go to eat, you should give it two tries before condeming it. Oh and RIck S, thanks for the review, but I'm guessing you have turned more people off with teh update, so I hope you don't go any other places I like.",2
"Seriously, don't come here for the food. The decor and atmosphere, yes. But not for the food. I made the mistake of ordering chili with my fries. I shudder to think of what type of meat was in the chili. Goosebumps are appearing on my skin as I'm remembering it. They say they have great BBQ. Really? No one from Kansas City would agreed with this. I love food and my standards are low. But even this was below it.",1
"Be very, very, very careful when coming to this dealership. nThey fully expect you to buy a car, without test driving it. n nUnfortunately, my husband and I were seriously interested in a car that could only be found at this dealership. Alas, they would not let us test drive it because ""they didn't want to put extra mileage on the car "". n nI've test driven Ferarris, Porsches, Range Rovers, BMWs, etc. and never had ANY of these dealerships blink an eye when I asked to test drive their vehicles. n nApparently, the cars at this dealership are just that ""exclusive "". n nSave your time and money, and go to another Dodge Jeep dealership that will treat you sanely, and with respect.",1
"Cheap, poor quality sushi. Go if you just lost the rest of your money at the tables.",1
"My brother and his wife were staying just up the road for a few days and invited me out for dinner, like I would ever turn down dinner. So when I got to their hotel I brought up the monocle and saw a bunch of places in the Scottsdale waterfront and Southbridge. The two that looked the most promising were Olive and Ivy and Culinary Dropout. We found parking and decided to try CD. Walking in we had a choice of an hour wait, the community tables or outside. Even in 100 u00b0 heat we chose outside and were rewarded by a cooled and shaded patio that was quiet enough to talk on. n nWe passed on the cheese platter and ordered entrees. Two hits and an ok on the salmon plate. I had the beef stroganof and even though I do better this was the best rendition I had ever purchased. Service was good throughout the meal. As we were catching up on 13 years of not seeing each other we were not pressed to leave even though there were people in line waiting on a Thursday evening. n nJust as a note This was my first trip to a Sam Fox restaurant and even being a sort of chain it certainly would not stop me from trying another of his concepts.",2
"Nice standard all around starbucks. n nI like to get my hot chocolate here some mornings if its not too packed. A couple of the girls and guys actually know what I want when I come in and it's already started for me so kudos to them. n nSometimes they are training in the morning, which can slow things down. But overall a solid place to get some hot cocoa in the morning. The barista's are knowledgeable and very quick and concise. n nThis particular location is always clean, Lots of seating indoor and outside, though I wish there were some big cushy seats like you find in other starbucks. There's always tons of free Wifi types here doing homework or goofing off on their laptop. n nIf your just committed a crime, and decide you immediately needed a coffee afterwards.you should probably avoid this Starbucks Local police love to sit and have a brew with each other in between and during shifts here. lol n nCheers! n n MikeB",2
Went for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised! We got an iced mocha and a vanilla latte. Both were delicious with no bitterness. We also got the biggest blueberry scone I've ever seen and it was also excellent. I received very good customer service as well. We will be back! Highly recommend.,2
"I love shopping Goodwill and have since I was a kid. I live beside this Goodwill on Johnston rd. so I go in almost daily. The employees and especially the Manager have never once spoken to me, except to ask needed questions during a purchase. No one has ever even smiled or said Hi to me, knowing I spend a lot of time and money there. As a fellow retail store Manager for 24 years i am appalled. I feel they are extremely rude even when I have made donations. In my perspective I feel like they act like i am shoplifting or something, which really makes me sad for them but personally very uncomfortable. Despite how they make me feel at this location , I believe in what Goodwill stands for and will continue to shop here because of the closeness to where I live and the memories of my grandma taking me ""Good Will Hunting ""as a child.",1
The best feeling ever INSANITY!,2
We ate dinner here with some friends while in Vegas. The steaks were great. everything is ala carte nothing comes on the plate except the steak. I would highly recommend the tomahawk steak.,2
"I came here with my family on the last night of my bachelorette weekend visit I'm from Vegas but no longer live there, and my parent live in Henderson I've come to this restaurant quite a few times, and I've always had a good experience. This time we had Dave the waiter, and he was awesome! I've met those waiters who goof around, but it really doesn't ""fit "" the situation, and Dave was the exception to this. He was funny, and had a good sense of humor. I had a bad crab experience the night before, but decided to give crab another try here. I have to tell you, I've never had such sweet crab in my life! I was so happy with everything. He had forgotten my crab and I gave him a hard time about it light hearted and he was a total trooper about the whole thing. He even brought us Chocolate covered strawberries to make up for the crab being a little behind, and from my bad experience the night before at another restaurant. If there's another special for the buffalo filet, I HIGHLY recommend it! Tastes like butter! Sweet crab, awesome steak, two thumbs up. If you're lucky, you'll get Dave.",2
Overall it was wonderful food. The shrimp fries were only a hit with five out of ten of us. I really enjoyed my teriyaki chicken sandwich and the burgers were a hit across the table. It has a great atmosphere with a relaxing water feature and NO tv's to interrupt dinner conversation.,2
"As a cupcake geek, I was pretty excited when I saw the beginning construction for this place earlier this year. So, I take no joy in expressing my disappointment with Cupcakes By Design. n nThe first time I went in there, I was really surprised by what I saw. For 3.50 per cupcake, I expected a little bit of creativity in the decoration or something. Instead, I found cupcakes that were about the size of what I bake at home with what amounted to a dollop of frosting. Yes, they obviously used a piping tip but there was no sense of fun or creativity in the decoration. And for 3.50, there should be a lot more frosting. I had their banana cupcake which was OK. It was the first time I had a banana cake that wasn't like banana bread but rather cake with some banana flavoring though I believe they used fresh bananas. The frosting was.meh. Whenever I go to another city, I always stop at a bakery. And it's rare that I've seen any place charge 3.50 for the size that this place offers. I just can't justify it in this case. n nI was also a little soured when I stopped in their another time to talk to the owner about an event I was having. I wasn't even asking for any donations only if they happened to have day old cupcakes they wanted to get rid of. If not, no big deal. I was going to go on and explain about this community event I was putting on called CupcakeCamp and maybe ask someone to come judge and I even had a little flyer, but the owner totally shut me down before I could go further. She wasn't rude by any means. But she certainly put the curt in courteous. I understand having trepidation with a new business and it's fine to say no to me. But to not even hear me out first, frankly, kind of sucked. And if you're a new business, you'd think one would want to hear about an opportunity to freely promote to a big crowd. I probably won't be swinging by here again until I feel like all bad cupcake karma has been vanquished.",1
Just went there today for lunch as my friend had never been. Really great experience. The waitress was friendly and kept the hot water coming for our tea. I suggested the hot turkey sandwich because of a recommendation on Yelp. My friend and I both ordered it and it was delicious!,2
I love this place! Its great for quick food that is yummy. I get the shrimp tacos and they are so delicious. I would recommend the shrimp tacos over the chicken or the pork. The prices are good too.,2
"Where to start? n nA friend recommended this place. n nService n nWe went later in the night so it wasn't busy at all. However, you would've thought it was packed because we had to wait a while to get drinks refills our order taken condiments after getting our food had to ask him twice and finally, the bill. n n nFood n nAfter reading the reviews on Yelp, and our friend's suggestion, I really wanted to try their chicken fried steak. Well, that was a bad idea because it was difficult to chew, the gravy looked like it had been out for too long and starting to curdle, and the extremely sweet candied carrots took up over a quarter of the plate, BUT the mashed potatoes were delicious. n nThe bf got the rack of ribs, which I got to try and that is the only reason this place gets two stars, because the whole night and all through the next day I had FOOD POISONING! n nI wish I had listened to Renee S.' review and steered clear from this place.never again!",1
"Poor service and was not impressed by the food. Wait staff didn't seem interested when taking our order. I had breakfast, the eggs were burnt and rubbery and the pancakes has sat under the warmer too long and did not taste fresh. Definitely won't be back here",1
"Third time's a charm for Good Food! Yes, we've tried to eat here twice before and both times the wait was astronomical 2 hours, 1 hr 45 min . So, that's the first tip for everyone the folks at Good Food do not take reservations, um, ever, I think? n nBut onto the evening, inside GFOM is simple, understated yet elegant. There's a pretty and low key bar, a fair number of tables and wonderful staff. Hubs and I were seated within minutes and tried a sampling of dishes. Before I get to the eats, I will concur with others I think the plates small and large are a bit on the pricey side. So, perhaps it's not the most fiscally responsible move to head here when you're super hungry as the portions are small. Food time. n nMixed green salad 4 5 A lovely salad, delicious and light with baby parsnips, cranberries and hazelnuts. Super light and a perfect way to start the feeding. n nSmoked Salmon 5 5 I don't even really like or order smoked salmon and I loved this dish. The fresh, smoked salmon with egg, potato capers with dill creme fraiche was a perfect blend of flavors. The little chippers were great! n nSeared Scallop w risotto 3 5 My lease favorite of the dishes as I was expecting more complex flavor. While the items reads beautifully, butternut squash risotto, shaved fennel bacon, my scallop there were 2 on the plate was quite undercooked and lacked depth. n nSteamed Bun 4 5 Nom worthy. It's been a long time since I've had a steamed pork bun of this caliber. The five spice rubbed pork belly was perfectly tender yet crispy on the edges and I loved the hoisin pickled vegetables. n nBaked Cavatappi 3 5 A good baked pasta dish w fresh, gooey mozzarella. Coming from a family of very talented Italian cooks, I wasn't wowed by the sauce but I did really love the Italian sausage mixed in. n nPork tenderloin the only large plate we ordered 3 5 The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and intense with smokey flavor yet the fried mac 'n cheese triangles were underwhelming. I didn't taste much cheese! n nPumpkin Bread Pudding 5 5 Drool. Sometimes I'm hesitant to order bread pudding because I get so disappointed when it turns out all French toast like. But this bread pudding was moist, bursting with delectable pumpkin flavor and topped with a gorgeous sliver of pumpkin seed brittle and some of the most delicious cheesecake ice cream I've had. Get it. n nSince the menu is eclectic and certainly inspired, I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more good food from GFOM!",2
"The crowd has a lot of undesirables and rift raft. I dont want need uber exclusive but its nice to go out to a nightclub where at least people look the part. My GF commented that the guys were super ugly. Even the bouncers sort of the looked goofy and academic. Forget about what people looked like, they were basically a lot of wierdo's. n nPerhaps I stopped by on a off night, but it I would have to agree that the crowd was not attractive. If your gonna go out, might as well choose a place that has a sexy crowd. otherwise why deal with the headaches, might as well have a fun night at O Shea's",1
This location has become a joke since lLuke left. The manager Sahar is never there and none of the employees can do anything without her permission. The past two times I reserved a weekend special they did not have a car for me then tried to get me to pay for an upgrade. I ended up leaving and not renting at all. My recommendation is to find a new manager!,1
It was bad. My nails are ruined. I asked for purple and sparkles and they gave me nothing near that. I got too many sparkles. They didn't even ask me if I liked it. My friend who went with me got 2 coats and a top. I got not even a full 1st coat it was the worst. I am going somewhere else tomorrow. I had the worse time ever. Looks like Rainbow nails will not be seeing me there any time soon!,1
"I am in the process of closing my accounts because this bank just stinks.not just this location but the bank in general. I'm going local. You can't call it service when there are only two tellers and a line of people. The actual tellers are nice enough for the most part so this all boils down to poor management and or saving money on operations by downstaffing. n nThe makes for a very poor operation that is sorely lacking in efficiency or any semblance of personalized service. Unfortunately my employer banks with Bank of America so while I'd like to say ""See you later "" if they actually ever get around to closing my account and sending me my money, I'm afraid they're still in my life to one degree or another.",1
"I ordered thai hot pad thai and spring rolls. I got egg rolls and bland pad thai. I am extremely disappointed after reading all these great reviews and having a crappy experience. I ordered for pick up and when I asked to make sure there was peanut sauce with my spring rolls I was just given a look as if I was crazy. seeing as how she gave me egg rolls I understand, but for her to not say anything after that except that it was going to be an extra dollar for the peanut sauce which I thought was a bit odd I found her lack of integrity disheartening. To top it off the egg rolls were barely edible and if I had ordered that pad thai to eat in the restaraunt I would have sent it back. The only saving grace was that 1 peanut sauce that i used on everything. n nSuffice it to say I will not be going back.",1
"Cute atmosphere! I had the ombr u00e9 drink which was a jalape u00f1o vodka and pineapple juice which was amazing! The lobster puffs and chicken sticks appetizers were delicious. I order the pork verde, it was okay, nothing special, I would not order it again and a side of mac and cheese with bacon that was SO GOOD! Our waitress was extremely sweet but it took forever to get anything, even to order food she would be gone for a long time. She brought out their cookie dough dessert for my uncles birthday which was so nice! I wouldn't suggest that, I want to go back and try the cobbler.",2
"Had the breakfast into lunch buffet this past Saturday. From about 11am to 1pm. n nEhhh, its ok. The desserts are the only good highlight. But everything else is so so. Decent selection of mostly standard lunch items. They have a coffee espresso machine. It made me an amazing mocha espresso drink and a separate cappuccino drink. Both amazing.",1
"Since I love his shows and became a fan, you got to try the food to see what all the hype is about! I already had his burgers, so next was some pub food. n nThe prices are high. first thing you notice. I got a Shepherd's pie just because it was the least expensive on the menu. 23 n nI had spent a lot of money throughout the night, I didn't want to over spend here too. The servers outfits were soo cool. I loved the chains and pants. They had a rock star look to them. n nMy server was attentive. I was just finishing up my water, when she stood by waiting until I put it down on the table and right away filled it up! lol. She was not leaving my glass empty. My food was fast and hot. It looks small but once you start digging in, you notice it's more than it looks. It was really good. The meat was juicy and the potatoes had just the right amount of flavor. I was pleased with my dinner. n nSo for my Pie and tip came to 29 bucks.",2
"Good food, family owned, priced right and overall a nice place to grab Mexican food at a reasonable price. Better than those BS fake places like Ajo ALs or Macayo. This is simple, fresh and done right. nOur good to place for wanting Mexican and budget conscience.",2
One of my favorite Sushi houses in the Valley. Food is high quality for an all you can eat and they have some of the best Yellowtail Sashimi I have found in Vegas. Being open 24 7 and having a 72 hour Happy Hour Fir Sunday would make me want to give the place 5 stars. n nSadly I can not do this. Even though I have been eating here a couple times a week for 3 months and regularly bring larger business groups with me it seems that management has decided that NO ONE IS TO BE TRUSTED and that all customers are potential thieves. n nI went in last night for dinner with my wife and they now have a strict policy that all members of the party must either do happy hour or all you can eat. If not then you are required to sit at the sushi bar where they can watch over you like children at the children table. Sadly this insulting disrespect after having been such a loyal patron has left me unwilling to take my business to Lahaina Grill any more,1
"I have been to Harold's many times over the years for breakfast with my motorcycle chapter. Last Sunday we had a reservation for 20 and called them when we were half an hour out to reconfirm and let them know we were on our way. We got there, the place was only semi full and we were seated and then? .15 minutes after arrival still no water or coffee offered. After 20 minutes of trying to get the attention of a waiter, half the group got up and walked out heading down the road for breakfast. After half an hour we were finally having our orders taken and all meals but one came 20 minutes later. After asking on 3 occasions as to the status of the missing meal that arrived after everyone else was finished eating. When we ordered we all ordered indicating separate or together but with only 10 of us we were amazed that it took another 30 minutes to get the bill. When the check came the waiter indicated it was one bill for the table and that was policy. So now we're up at the cash register for 15 minutes trying to sort that out and a day later finding that my credit card that I handed over for a 14 bill is charged 28. To top it all off, I had a voice mail on my cell phone from Harold's at 9.45am inquiring if we were still planning on coming for our 8.45am reservation. I love the ride up to Cave Creek but quite frankly Harold's has some serious issues that they need to work on. I won't be returning anytime soon as there are too many good options in Cave Creek that have their act together.",1
"WOW.This place can teach a lot to the ""hole "" in the Crenshaw district of LA with the same name. Not only is this place much cleaner, the wait staff are nice and check on you to make sure the experience is good. nThe cornbread pancakes are so good. What a nice way to launch into you're meal. Some of you may be disgusted and I don't care but I'm a huge fan of Chitterlings and I got a good serving at M M's. Taste almost as good as mine and my Mom's. Add Mac n' Cheese, Collard's and rice and gravy and I was a happy camper. Thank God I have friends I can visit in Vegas because next time I' back, I'll be stopping by M M's. I have a good feeling everything on the menu is really good.",2
"The rooms we stayed in were nasty, floors were dirty and stained, and smelled like a perm shop. But what really makes this place horrible is the customer service. Went to Starbucks to get a iced coffee for my wife and she rudely says ""we don't have any more iced coffee "" either they were out of ice or they were out of coffee in thinking ? then shes like we'll we do have americano. That's coffee now were is the ice We also went to the breakfast buffet which was good but 10 hours later we are pooping like pigeons and still feel full ? Somethings not right The staff there were really rude as well smart remarks when all I had was a question. And do not eat the cookies from the cafe they must have been at least a month old. And my wife loves cookie but she passed I will never go there again ! If this place would hire the right person to manage the facilities people would want to come back. Maybe they just don't care! I would love to have the chance to manage that casino sounds like a nice career if its done right. oh and the remote in our room was for a zenith we had a GE !",1
Bought a safe here from these guys awhile back and had problems with it recently . Called and found out they shut down. WTF!,1
"Great place to get away to golf, spend day at spa and pool. Evening life great if you like to dance and gamble. Restraints are yummy! Room are super nice!",2

"Isn't it amazing how ""one bad apple "" can spoil the whole bunch?! I had a bad experience with one employee at Budget at the Charlotte airport and now will NEVER rent from Budget again thanks to a bad attitude and inability to simply be nice. n nI don't enjoy writing negative reviews on any business but I hope some of my points will be well received and considered by Budget to improve their customer service. n nLong story short, I was not pleased with the way I was treated by one employee in particular. In the time she spent talking over me, giving me bad nonverbal communication and trying to explain Budget's company policy about being slightly late which would cost me an extra 166 for a mere 15 30 minutes , she could have smiled, been nice, helpful, understanding, gracious and focused on making me feel good about Budget. n nThe company policy to charge someone 386 rather than 220 for a mere 20 minutes difference is totally absurd, by the way. n nHints for Budget n n1 Focus on outstanding positive customer service and having everyone simply be nice, considerate, understanding and use the Golden Rule. n n2 Teach employees that tone and body language toward customers makes a big difference and can be the difference in keeping or losing a customer. One split second of bad nonverbal communication can make or break a relationship with a customer. n n3 Examine how much time it takes after printing an agreement, getting insurance information, obtaining signatures and conducting the walk around of the car BEFORE customers actually have possession of the car and how many minutes it takes to wait in line to return a car as well. n n4 Examine company policy about the grace period on returns and examine just how much is reasonable to charge for a late fee. I would submit that 386 rather 220 for a mere 20 minutes is unheard of, or should be unheard of, with any rental company. n nI'll be going back to Hertz where I'm treated nicely and I don't have to go through all these problems! One bad apple spoiled the whole bunch for me.",1
Cash only. n nFood nothing special. Some of the dishes we ordered were questionable. Hot sour noodle soup wasn't either hot or sour. It was just flavorless. Meat in fried rice smelled funny. n nTwo stars for the guy who served our table. He was nice.,1
Love this place! Everything is excellent! The tacos are perfect and crunchy and the steak fajitas are delish! n nI love the atmosphere too! It's one of three places I got to when I'm craving Mexican food!,2
"Clean interior n Friendly staff n Convenient location n Extensive but not overwhelming menu choices n Really good food! n nThis may be North Scottsdale's best kept secret. Although it seemed a bit odd to have a fish taco at a Hawaiian themed restaurant I figured, why not? I once had McDonalds in Japan and KFC in London this was much better. n nThe fish tacos you get 2 on separate plates come with a rather small soft taco shell that's piled high with fish, mango, cole slaw, etc. It's nearly impossible to fold this up and I guarantee some food is going to drop out don't worry about it, but get a fork. I also tried the fish and chips again in a Hawaiian themed restaurant? which were also excellent. n nAt first I thought the prices were a bit high the fish tacos were 11 but after tasting the food I think they're well worth the price. n nFYI I had a little trouble finding this place. The address is on Scottsdale but it faces Bell just west of the intersection. It's very close to Carlos O'Brien's.",2
"Stay away from this park. The dogs that frequent this park belong as extras stand ins for Cujo. n nI left Washington Park when I moved to be closer to school and this little park was my only closest option. My dog was never aggressive until she had to defend herself here. All the dogs swarm to the gates when you come a behavior that makes the incoming dog extremely nervous even aggressive , the owners don't pick up after their dog with the excuse that there are no bags provided, there is no little big dog separation, and most of the dogs aren't trained to even come to their owner in case of an event. It's like a meth lab waiting to explode. n nOn a busy night, you can literally walk in and feel the tension between the dogs. My last time there, it was extremely busy but I still let my dog in because she's never had any problems before. All the dogs teamed up and chased my 90lb baby the moment she got in and the owners mostly college students literally just stared dumbfounded and watched until she snapped back to defend herself. Then I was the one being glared at and given the stink eye like it was my fault. n nI'm sorry, I didn't know I just stepped into Michael Vick's backyard by accident instead of the dog park. n nI had to re socialize my dog at one of the fancy, for rich people indoor doggy daycare thank heavens for Groupon and finally, 1 1 2 years later, my dog can finally step foot in a dog park. She's still prone to ignore other dogs and doesn't tend to be very social with the dogs in the park, but it's a step in the right direction. Wish I had never gone here.",1
"I found these guys on a coupon that they were advertising. They had a special for around 28 or so for a car wash and an oil change. I needed both, so decided to check them out. Staff is nice, and went to work right away. I didn't wait too long because I went near closing time. Oil change was done in 10 15 minutes at the max, and kept my car clean. No oil drips underneath the hood, and vehicle paint was protected while they were working on it. Put in the right oil without asking me. The car was was good as well. Very thorough wash. They took off my antenna, and did a great job vacuuming. The only small gripe was that the cashier didn't know how to input my coupon, so it took a few minutes. Beyond that, I'm definitely a fan, and will be going back without a problem!",2
"what else is left to say that the other 400 reviews haven't mentioned? n nWe started with potstickers and they were delicious, prepped really well.

I can't wait to go back to this place and try something new.",2
"I heard about Jet Luxury through a travelzoo deal and for the first time, I have to say they dun me wrong! n nJet Luxury is not at all ""luxurious. "" I should have seen all the warning signs before I booked with them. First, it's really hard to get in touch with both their reservation staff line and their other line meant for guests. I actually was hung up on and when I finally was able to talk to a representative, their service was lackluster. In fact, the cashier at my local McDonald's probably is more eloquent. n nTrue, booking through them would have saved me about 20 day, but I have to safely say, ""you get what you pay for. "" n nSecond, read that fine print. At the Vdara, they will only clean OnCe during your entire stay. That's fine if you are only staying two nights, but I was planning on staying close to a week and that I found gross and totally unacceptable! n nThe there's the fact that technically, since they rent Vdara condos that are privately owned, it's in no way linked to the hotel. It's fine if they have folks on staff to help you, but apparently, they are only there for a few hours a day, so tough. n nYolanda, the representative who helped me cancel my reservation was the one who saved them from a one star rating. They never charged me, since I didn't stay, but if I were you, you can find a comparable deal through smartervegas.",1
"Went here with a party of six for a friend's birthday. We made it for happy hour and picked up coupons for a free margarita with purchase of an entree. That and three free shots for the birthday boy were the redeeming factors of this meal. I ordered the cheese enchiladas with sides of rice and black beans. Plating of the food was nice, but taste was mediocre. Plus, my meal was served nearly cold. Everyone else in my party seemed to think the food was good, though.",1
"The finest steakhouse I can ever ask for. n nEverything they do, from linens, to pork loins in perfection. n nI've had the pleasure of visiting this establishment a few years back in LA and that location didn't disappoint either, however the Arizona location has an ambience that LA did not. n nThe steaks are just perfect.

"Went to Salvatore's last night for a combined B Day Meal. Mine and my Aunt's. The place was hopping at 7pm Friday I'm glad they take and we had a reservation. By 8 30 however the place was much quieter and would have been easy to get a walk in table. n nStarters the salad special of the evening Lots of local fresh veggies and a house made dressing. My mother and aunt thought said dressing was spicy the rest of us not so much. The salad and dressing could have used a sprinkling of salt and pepper. But was overall a success. Also had the House Made Burrata Fresh Mozzarella stuffed with feathered curd. This also came with nice local greenery, roasted garlic and killer house made croutons. n nPizzas we ordered three and that was more than enough for the 5 of us. We essentially took home the equivalent of 1.5 pizzas. n nWe ordered the nightly special pizza the farmers market special sans the jalape u00f1os Mom and Aunt's aversion to anything spicy . This was a veggie pizza given my Aunt is a vegetarian. It was loaded with fresh, local veggies although I would have preferred it with the jalape u00f1os. We also ordered the 4 house made Italian Sausage and the 11 smoked Gouda, mushrooms, and bacon. n nThe 4 and the 11 were standouts. I'm not sure which I preferred more. Doesn't matter because I've got the leftovers in my fridge. I'm very picky about pizza. This is now perhaps one of two or maybe three places I'm willing to go to for pizza. It's worth the trip to Sun Prairie from the greater Madison area. Salvatore's commitment to quality local ingredients shows. n nOne note if you are coming from Madison on 151, the sign for West Main is going to take you the wrong direction on West Main when exiting from 151.",2

"OMG! Please read all the yelp reviews, all of them are definitely true. The only reason I stayed here was because it was the only hotel that was available. Since, this was a last minute trip it was booked on our way to Vegas. The rooms are small, stink and need major improvements. The hallways carpets are really dirty and outdated. The elevators are small and stink when you first walk in. For the amount you pay on this hotel booking, try to invest on another hotel. I think the stratosphere is much better then this place. n nThey don't really have a lot of gambling tables. If they do not a lot of people are winning. n nWhat I really did like about this place was the divas show. I love how Marino put the show together and divas made my night a little better! It's located in the middle of strip and O'shea is back! n nPlease don't think twice, don't book here!",1
"This review is solely for the Evening Wear Department. I came in here yesterday to look a for a long dress to wear to a wedding. Two associates saw me walk in looking around and I was never approached to see if I needed help. These two snobby ladies were just chitchatting like I didn't exist but offered assistance to this one shopper who carries a very expensive purse. then another sales associate was talking on her phone the whole time that I didn't even realize she works there until she asked if I needed help, took the dress from my hand that I wanted to try on and puts it back in the rack and continues to talk on her phone who the f c does that?! I was so annoyed, I left the store. So unprofessional!So to NM management, please teach your staff how to treat your customers with respect before your company goes downhill.",1
"Having this park right across the street for work is great! Now that the weather is getting warmer I enjoy going over at lunch. Sometimes I bring my lunch and just sit near the lake pond and enjoy the fresh air, ducks, geese, and people. Currently I come over at lunch to walk the mile loop around the lake. Great way to get some excersize in and some beautiful scenery. I have not tried the new desert walking trail, but hope to in the next couple of days. n nI do watch those ducks and geese when I walk by, I think they may attack me, haha.

"I fly quite regularly down to Phoenix used to go direct to Tucson, but express jet went bankrupt and I am stuck with US Airways as being the only non stop from Spokane. With that being said I have never had an issue with them. But this last time really fried me and my traveling companion. n nWe showed up at the Phoenix Airport check in counter 1 hour and 16 minutes before our flight was to leave. We had tried to E check in the night before but the system could not find our return reservation. n nFor over 45, yes FOURTY FIVE minutes we worked with a representative and then their supervisor do find our reservation. We had the original receipt with the confirmation code but they could not find either one of our tickets. n nLow and behold at exactly 29 minutes before the flight was to leave the supervisor looked up and said ""well here is your reservation, but I can't issue you a ticket! "" n n ""Why not "" n n ""Because you got here too late, you must check in at least 30 minutes before your flight leaves and YOU she did stress YOU didn't do that. "" n nI am not kidding you. It took us another 10 minutes before she would issue us a boarding pass for the 830 PM flight NOTE It's 10 AM now a full 12 hours to wait . We made a mad dash for the plane zoomed through the security and showed up at our original flight, only to be told that the flight was closed and there was nothing they could do. So we waited and watched the plane sit at the gate for 23 minutes before it finally pushed back. n nWe went to customer service and were told again ""It is our fault for not arriving early enough. "" And ""You should expect computer glitches and get here earlier, it's not US Airways fault. "" n nThey had the audacity to tell us that we should arrive at least 4, yes FOUR hours before a domestic flight with carry on baggage only. Imagine if we were traveling international with checked baggage, should we be at the airport 24 hours in advance? n nUS Airways gave us no meal vouchers for their screw up and while we waited and waited we watched two different times that the doors were re opened on a closed flight for passengers that got there late. n nThey had no apologies, except to blame us for their computer error they did nothing to help us out, meal vouchers, etc. They ignored our request for seats near the front of the plane I was in the 2nd to the last row 22 , while stand by passengers for this flight received rows 7, 8 and 11. n nIt will be a cold day in hell before I fly on this airline again, I will change planes, I will wait extra, I will do what it takes, but never again will I be told that THEIR computer problems are MY fault.",1
"I felt I was having a bad dream the whole time I was eating here. n nI was hungary, and in mood for shaved ice. n nWe ordered the fruit ice, a bulgogi burrito, and a spicy ramen. n nWhen they girl gave me the bulgogi burrito, it fitted right in her palm, and she has a small hand. 2 for 2 bites of dry tortilla and bulgogi without any salsa and cilantro. It was a joke. n nI was told no meat in ramen, that's fine. But I was not told that my ramen is going to look and taste like instant noodle Shin Ramen . If I knew that, I would have gone home and cook it with microwave. I would not have to pay 6 for that. n nThe shaved ice was not bad, only thing was we had to ask more condensed milk for our ice. I guess only we like things on the sweet side when eating dessert. n nIf I am ever return to this place again, please wake me up from my nighmare.",1

"My experience was poor. I was so excited to try this place after seeing and hearing so many good things. When I arrived the hostess was rude and pretended that I didn't exist until she realized that I wasn't going away. We were sat quite quickly, but it took nearly 15 minutes before our waiter came to take a drink order. I ordered ne of their signature drinks and was pleased when it arrived. Our waiter brought out bread and herb butter, but the butter was nearly frozen and impossible to spread over the cold bread. I was a little taken back by the pricing on the menu, and I'm not cheap by any means. In fact a table of eight were seated near us, and once they saw the menu, the entire party left. Well it took our waiter another 15 minutes to come back and take our order. I chose the beef tenderloin and my date chose the fish. After getting refilled three times, the waiter came to us and said that our food is coming, but that the kitchen was backed up. There weren't that many people there so I wasn t buying it but we waited.and waited.and after 40 minutes I was brought a cold steak on a hot plate.not happy. I mentioned it to the waiter and all he said was that he could have another made. I said I didn't have another 40 minutes to waste as it was after 9PM when I got my food to begin with. He left and came back later with a huge smile and the bill. First and last time dining here. Portions are small, price is high, and I could have had the same meal for half the price some place else.",1
"I cant give this place less than 1. We paid our bar tab in cash. Left a cash tip. Then security came to tell me to go to my room.

Security then got on their cell to get further instructions? ? While I realize its past 5am, b ut i am in complete control of my faculties, Wtf? ? Officer Rooney told me what could i do about it? I can leave a nasty review. Its bullshit when you get harassed for being a paying customer! !

"So we called up Gus restaurant, spoke to David Ferguson on a Friday afternoon to get a possible reservation for the same evening. Not a problem at the bar! We arrive to be greeted by David, knowing him from Joli fou, we get our place at the bar right in front of David. nWe get a drink, take a look at the menu, friends had said it was more of a comfort food menu, decided on a gigot de agneau, and a confit de canard, a shrimp tempura to begin. The shrimp arrives tasteless, no flavour, no salt, no pepper, nothing, with a mango sauce dip, nothing to write home about! nThen David calls the order to Josh for the main course, and Josh says last confit! Somehow a short while, 20 ,minutes later, David announces the confit was a mix up, somehow another table was served, he says it will be another 20 minutes? But remembering hearing that that was the last one, sounded strange, there would be another pulled out of the air or freezer? Possibly frozen, so it finally arrives, and is quite ordinary, the agneau does not measure up either, very chewy, but the over praised rapini vegetable of the day, is served saut u00e9ed for 30 seconds, raw, bitter, and no flavour! Not even a spec of salt? Leaving quite disappointed, wondering what had just transpired, walked home and felt an overwhelming feeling of illness, something with the canard was very off. Will confer with friends to see if just maybe it was an off night for the place, or are we just better cooks ourselves?",1
"So tired of cabbing and driving to fremont, only to whup it up and face the challenge of getting back to ground zero, eg, casino lodgings on the strip. n nDeciding to book a room and it was fine.

We were on the 4th floor, a bit loud due to the festivities, but no problem for me to crash. n nRoom was great. Basic but good. Loved the art work. Would definately stay again.

"Are. You. Serious. n nWhy in the world is this place so popular? I really wish it wasn't so I wouldn't have been tempted to go and waste my time and money! n n1. Took them 15 20 minutes to bring us water. We just came from a pool party and we were SOOO dehydrated. It shouldn't really matter where we came from, everyone is dehydrated in Vegas, it's a desert! Hello! Can we please have some water ASAP?! n n2. Food took a million years to come out. n n3. Food was mediocre, at best. The 30 ribs were so dry they tasted like dirt. The pasta had no flavor. The omelette was okay. The burger was okay too. But we could've gone somewhere else and paid the same price for much better food. REGRETS! n n4. The frozen hot chocolate they brought me the only thing I really wanted to come for looked and tasted TERRIBLE! Well, I guess it tasted alright. Like icy hot chocolate basically. But RIGHT when they brought it out, it was melting all over! I couldn't even get a good picture in. I had to send it back. I have NEVER sent back anything in my life, but I was NOT about to pay 15 is that how much it is? for that. No thank you. They brought the tables next to me prettier frozen hot chocolates. Why did MINE suck?! Whatever, saved 15 I guess. n nDon't waste your time, people! Go elsewhere. n nExtremely disappointed as I was really looking forward to trying this place!",1
"I've honestly never been so baffled by nearly universal praise for an establishment. n nFull disclosure I'm a barista. I'm by no means a coffee expert, but I know the do's and don'ts and can tell a good cup from a bad one. Let's just say I knew my coffee experience was going to be awful before I even ordered my drink. n nBiggest red flag was that all their espresso was preground. It's common sense that you grind your beans as close to extraction as possible. Everyone wants their coffee fresh, right? Second warning sign was a practice that I've honestly never seen done before. For some strange reason the barista was dosing a certain amount of espresso into the portafilter and then scooping equally old if not older espresso into it with a piece of wood from a mound off of the dirty counter. At this point I had to avert my eyes because the horror of what I was witnessing was just too painful. Luckily, I opened my eyes just in time to see the guy cover my cappuccino with a thick layer of cocoa powder. n nNo need to go into the nitty gritty about the taste, obviously it wasn't good. If you're reading this before your first Olimpico experience, there's still hope! Head down St. Viateur until you hit Cafe Myriade II . Primo coffee 49th Parallel and the baristas know what they're doing.",1
"A restaurant with ""fish "" as part of it's name should know how to cook fish perfectly. I ate there twice because I wanted to give them a second chance.mistake. The fish was overcooked and dry both times and the lobster was rubbery. It was such a let down. The lobster bisque that Costco sells is far better than the bland version at Kings. They did have a decent California roll though. I was disappointed and will avoid this place in the future.",1
Have not been there in a while and went last Friday. Worst service ever. I was sitting at a table with 10 people and our server served us 1 drink in over 3 hours. I have worked in the food service industry so I know things can get crazy and sometime you have an off night but it was obvious she wasn't caring about our table at all. She went to the table next to us 6 7 times and their drinks were full the whole night. Finally we left and went to Brio.,1

"My boss and I go here at least once a month. She calls it good Jew food I call it happiness between sliced marble rye. n nNot surprisingly, The Downtown Deli offers shovel fuls of sliced meat between your choice of bread, often with a side of fries, always bound to sate your appetite. Admittedly, I'm a light ish eater and quickly fill up, but The Downtown Deli becomes a great solution to having tasty leftovers to remind you about why working downtown makes sense. n nI just love The Downtown Deli. It makes be feel very metropolitan and sophisticated. Because, what else gleans class than a packed belly and pastrami breath?",2
"Always loved this place. Come here every time I'm in Phoenix. This time I had a waitress that seemed distracted yeah you, the one who was working this Saturday afternoon And didn't smile much or was having internal conversations while she was dropping utensils and clashing plates. She was preoccupied when she took my order and totally forgot my fries.wasn't even on the bill. I don't know, when a burger waitress forgets fries orders she should be fired. She apologized when I told her and she said she was just looking out for my diet. Cute, but where is the incentive to come back? I mean forgetting fries with a burger is pretty obscene. She pissed me off so much I don't want to go back for a while. nI guess my point is that service doesn't represent the individual but the restaurant as a whole. If they hire people who have no understanding of customer satisfaction and they are no longer representing the restaurant but only themselves, then it means the restaurant is slipping as they are no longer managing service. This waitress clearly was not representing the restaurant, or even aware she was working. The decline of good consistent service is a bad sign.",1
"I breezed through here tonight after seeing ""Bakery "" on their sign and thinking a sweet treat would be a nice end to the day I just moved near this shopping center and am still exploring what is available . I checked the hours sign before entering, although there were a few people seated at tables, and saw it was 30 minutes until closing time. realizing that they aren't going to make cupcakes while I wait, I thought I could run in and check it out. The shitty look I got from the young lady mopping the front of the house made me think I should have just gone to Starbucks next door for a slice of lemon pound cake. n nWell. Meh pretty much describes it. At 6 30 pm the bakery items consisted of 2 6 packs of cupcakes, 2 muffins, 2 lemon bars, some cookies and a few Inside Out Peanut Butter Cups. There was a young lady mopping the entire front of the store, including the ordering cashier area there were wet floor signs posted, but shouldn't closing clean up be done after closing? , a gentleman that appeared to be cleaning up the ktichen ish area behind the counter and a very nice young lady working the cash register bakery area. I told her this was my first time visiting and asked what was good. She said the lemon bars and the Inside Out Peanut Butter Cups. I took two of the lemon bars and one of the IOPBC's which is a peanut butter cookie ish concoction in the shape of a muffin, with a chocolate frosting in the middle for a grand total of just under 8. And . meh. Both were fine, neither knocked my socks off. The boxed mix of lemon bars that you whip up from the grocery store are more lemony. The crust was okay not too crumbly or hard. Not bad. shrug . The IOPBC was interesting, but again nothing stellar. The peanut butter cookie muffin part was a tad dry, but I did visit at the end of the day, so not exactly the peak of their freshness. n nI did look at the food menu while the young lady was boxing up the sweets and it looked pretty good. I will probably go back and check out lunch, but for dessert I will head next door to Starbucks for some kind of calorie laden coffee product, I wasn't wow'ed by the bakery portion at all.",1
"I really like this place. The beer was really good, food was tasty and fresh. The only negative is that they gave me grief about bringing my 4 month old, who did not make a peep, in the server was nice, but the manager apparently had an issue with it . I could definitely understand if it were busy, but it was 7 00 p.m. on a Monday and we were basically the only people in there. That said, I thought this place was great and would definitely recommend.",2
"As I begin to write my review I realize the server I am about to disparage is gossiping with the hostess behind me discussing her discontent with her most recent tip. This is NO Houston's! What happened to ensuring a well manicured table, timely service, and a full glass of wine. Boo.",1

"Still stand by my prior review. The hot links were the best thing I had, the ribs were fine once again, brisket unimpressive again, I actually liked the cheesy potatoes as opposed to my g f, sweet corn was institutional.

"Me and a friend ate lunch here. The food was good when it finally came out! Our waiter was consistent on us ordering smaller portions and taco. Our entree took about 40mins to come out.

The staff was being reprimanded by him after the incident! extremely unprofessional the food was great! But this manager made everything uncomfortable.",1

"This is by far the best place I have ever played in Vegas. The staff is very attentive and nice and the action is always great cause the V holds convetions all the time and the conventioners are always ready to blow off some cash playing poker on there trip to Vegas. After all it couldn't be much different that there home game, huh? The management is quick to open a table so you are not waiting long and no matter what time of the day there is always a game going on. There are so many local grinders here that love to call off with top top which can be nice sometimes too, unless of course your caught bluffing. The service is pretty good but the waitresses although nice, could be a little younger and more attractive. The comps just got bumped to 2 hr which means you can afford a nice lunch after a morning of grinding or a nice dinner if you been playing all day. If your truly a poker player then don't stop anywhere but here.",2
"This place is only meh. Considering all of the great reviews this place has, I have to question the taste buds of people trying this place. I guess it's fine for rolls smothered with teriyaki sauce, all of those rolls tastes the same to me, but for sushi or sashimi, this place is pretty bland tasting. I even had the lobster roll, which should taste lobster, but all I tasted again was the teriyaki sauce. Given that though, the service was ok, and the location in the mall doesn't really help much for ambiance.",1
"This was only the second time I have been to Cathay House. I came for dim sum years ago and didn't have much of a desire to return but I couldn't resist giving them another chance recently. n nWe arrived around noon and they weren't too busy. I felt rushed to order, even though we kept telling them we wanted to wait for our entire party to be seated. We ordered hot tea and waters all around and then proceeded to order from the carts that came around. n nThey pushed the ginger scallion lobster with pasta on us and although a good value at 15.99, it had to be reheated before they served it to us. The lobster was chewy and the noodles felt like total filler, didn't have much flavor and were overcooked. The highlights from our meal were the custard buns and crab balls. The ribs had to be reheated for us before serving which was a turn off. n nThe rest of the items we ordered weren't very memorable and I wouldn't recommend most, if any, of it. The coconut bun, egg custard, bbq pork buns and smelt were all completely forgettable. n nService was ok, although refills were a little hard to come by for our waters and tea. There are other dim sum places in town I prefer with fresher items, so I don't see myself coming back any time soon.",1
"The location would sell the place even if the food and beer were only OK. The former church is an amazing place to visit in its own right. n nFortunately, the beer and food stand up equally well and made for a tremendously enjoyable evening. n nWe were in town for a pre Christmas get away and went to CBW for dinner on a Wednesday night. n nWe feared the worst when we pulled into the side street and the their lot to see it quite full and figured that were in for a wait inside. Thankfully, our concerns were unfounded as the place was busy but not crowded. n nWe sat on the ""pub "" side to the left of the aisle. Our server arrived promptly with drink menus and quickly gave excellent descriptions of all of their seasonal beers. I go to a lot of brewery restaurants and one of my biggest peeves are servers who have no clue about the product that they are trying to sell. It was a pleasure to hear someone enthusiastically describe their beers. n nI settled on the Mexican Mole Stout. It was peppery and complex yet really balanced and enjoyable. It didn't feel ""contrived "" like many infused beers. After that, I went on to the barleywine ad have to say it was excellent as well with lots of alcohol warmth, complex malt tastes and very nice notes of the bourbon aging. n nMy wife enjoyed the SteamHammer very much. n nAs an appetizer, we couldn't turn down the fired risotto balls. They were a wonderful treat and I'm going to try to replicate this recipe. n nFor dinner we settled on the portabello mushroom pizza and it was equally good and adequately portioned. n nHighly recommended restaurant.",2
"I remember going to the OPH near Detroit when I was kid. I never realized they were a chain until I moved to WNY and they had three loactions there, which were all just as good.

NO SECURITY n nTerrible experience would had had a better time at the drive in sitting in a lawn chair . They had ELECTRICIAL FIRE in one theater so they has everyone stand in line for the next showing which was delayed. The Manager would not make a decision to have the former patrons stand in line with everyone he was allowing them to just cut in line in front of everyone else until people in line asked for security which was afraid to do anything either. The only thing security did was allow handicap in first but that is the only thing good I can say !,1
Husband got me a red velvet cupcake from here. I thought it was the worst red velvet cupcake I've ever had. Tasted more like a yellow cake with the cream cheese frosting on top. The frosting wasn't all that great either.,1
"Let them eat cake! n nDuring my stay at Caesar's Palace this past weekend I discovered the most amazing patisserie. My sister and I were heading to the Forum Shops and found Payard Patisserie and Bistro. n nChocolates, pastries and ice cream oh my! I seriously wanted just about everything in this shop. The pastries were so beautiful.almost too beautiful to consume! Almost. n nI purchased a box of chocolates as a gift for someone I know who adores chocolates. Word is they are some of the best chocolates ever. I also selected a package of Madelines which were so plump and fluffy. I even saw little flecks of vanilla bean. So yummy! n nOne night after dinner we decided we could all go for a sweet treat. I ordered the coconut sorbet which was the most coconutty, creamy sweetest cold treat I have ever had. I also sampled a bite of my other sister's Raspberry Rhubarb Napoleon. I'm not a rhubarb fan, but I couldn't even taste it. The pastry was so light and flaky! n nIf you have a sweet tooth like me, you'll definitely want to pay a visit to Payard! Bon Appetite!",2
Worse frozen yogurt! They have a decent selection of flavors but none of them tasted good. The texture was grainy and extremely sweet. Toppings were being refilled with packaged candy and the fruits were not fresh. I wouldn't waste my calories at this place.,1
"Im not sure if its due to the fact that its located in a mall, or because the mall itself is just outside of a dumpy neighborhood guadalupe . But the patrons of this theater dont seem to have common movie etiquette. As the pg 13 movie was beginning, i saw a man come in with 4 babies. Yep 4 babies. Anyone who has been in this situation, knows the rest of this story. Movie theaters are loud. And no place for a baby. Let alone 4 of them. And its an adult movie. Not some disney flick. Anyway, with so many other theater options available i just moved this one to the bottom of the list.",1
"As far as railway stations go, this is one I don't look forward travelling through. There's no indoor part to wait, and I get cold easily. There are lots of 'middle lanes' between tracks and I don't like waiting on those parts fear of someone falling onto the tracks . There's a wee Starbucks outside for half decent coffee, and one wee Pumpkin inside for half decent food. The entrance is small and there are now automatic barriers which make it really tough to get through in rush hour, with all the people. There just isn't generally much good about this station really. It's not terrible, just not a very enjoyable part of the train travelling experience.",1
"OK, why was the idea of a barcade never done before? n ngranted, some of the controls were sticky, the good ones taken, but still lots of fun,and a reasonable time to hang with an elementary school friend with whom our first bonding experiences together were playing video games at the 7 11 on the way home from school. n nNow we're old enough to drink. well, make that old enough to purchase alcohol, neither of us seem to drink much anymore",2

"Our favorite buffet in Las Vegas! The quality of the food is outstanding for the price you pay.

We try to get here either early or late for lunch so that the wait is not longer than 20 minutes. Still, if the wait was over an hour, it would be worth it to me. n nFor the price it costs with a player's card , the Feast Buffet at Red Rock Casino is absolutely the best in Vegas! n nTip If you are a dessert lover like me , then make sure to save room for dessert! There are so many exceptional choices! The majority taste just as good as they look!",2
"I guess I am one of the few that doesn't care for this place. It's busy, small, and a loud kid is very noticeable. The hubbiend I had made our quarterly get together w an old friend at Sekai a few weeks previously, so we went non sushi. Got king crab soup. The base of the soup reminded me of the evil jungle princess at Thai Rama, so yum. But for 6 I would have liked more crab. The chicken and shrimp fried rice, not so good. I was wanting a comfort dish . Hubbie's chicken teriyaki kind bland w a nice helping of vegetables. The rest of our group got sushi. Portions looked large, but it just did not look appetizing to me. This was our second visit to Sushiya and I don't believe I will go back. Sekai is first choice and I wouldn't mind another visit to Masa.",1
"Yelped ""breakfast near Imperial Palace "" n nThis place was 2. I had a Nutella Crepe with added strawberries for 2.50 and an iced caramel macchiato. My uncle had the berry crepe with a customized coffee. n nMy crepe doesnt compare with my crepes from The Creperie back home. As far as location goes, it was a very fancy breakfast. The food was very simple, not over the top. I was satisfied with my coffee and I didn't have to do any additional adjustments. n nThe crepes go for around 9 bucks each. Just for something that sounds like 3 ingredients for each. If you would like to add more fruit, 2.50. I think 3 for ice cream. It came out pretty expensive, I think just for a simple breakfast, but its Las Vegas n nIts more upscale than your regular Starbucks. n nThe utensils fooled me. They're silver plated plastic.",2
"So, I called the place to reserve a birthday cake. I did it well in advance and I am sure I dialed the right number too. n nWhen I showed up they didn't have it. I was shocked and a little angered that they lost my order but when all came about I had made my order to another store location, and instead they just canceled that one and whipped up a cake on the spot, the one I wanted, how I wanted it and didn't charge me anything extra. For that I am very pleased. They acted and handled this situation like pros. n nThe negative is that I know I called this location, and I must just assume that the number is forwarded if they don't pickup. The people in the store said this is not the case, and I could be wrong but I doubt it. n nThe smaller bundt cakes size of a big burger are awesome! When it becomes bigger like birthday cake big, the cake losses its awesomeness. It's still good, but not like the smaller ones. That just a tip!",2
"I went back for a second time to Brio since the first had been un memorable in a large group. The decoration is nice and seems to have a cool bar. n nThe food is mediocre at best, overpriced for what it is, bad mixed drinks. Service is OK.",1
I met with D'Lisa after my first post and she did a great job on my eyebrows after discussing what I was hoping for. I have been back twice since and am happy with the results. Thanks D'Lisa for taking the time on my eyebrows and making them look good.,2

"When we first went here about a year ago, the food was good, decent portions, ok service. Over the next few months, it all went downhill. The restaurant got dirty, as mentioned by other reviewers, the waitstaff got a bad attitude, and the food was no longer very good.small portions, burnt or undercooked. So we haven't been back in about 4 months and will not go back again.",1
"I discovered their Mexicana omelette on this past trip. This was ordered with egg whites, a side of fruit and their famous 6 pound biscuit. OK, it's not 6 pounds but you feel like you gained this after eating the decadent biscuit. n nThe Mexican Omelette has chorizo sausage, avocado, onion your choice of cheese. My choice was a spicy jack cheese. The entire dish is smothered in a YUMMY mexico green chile sauce. This is really outstanding. n nFresh OJ, Good coffee and the above dish couple with great service. You'd think this place would be packed? The bad news is, it is packed! Get here early and you'll get a good booth spot.",2
"This review is for the casino. n n nI loved the craps tables here. From 2 30am 5 30am I was here rolling dice with degenerate gamblers, gruff dealers stickmen and had a great time. So why did I have a great time? I tip the dealers. Nobody on the table did but myself. I put one dollar on hardway's six eight randomly from time to time and I nailed it six times with three different sets of dealers. They liked me alot. The one stickman who was being a real asshole to the other players kept saying ""Brian, come on can you just hit this? I've been here over 40 minutes and this isn't happening. "" When I finally did nail the hardway sixes he bellowed out ""Thank God, it finally fucking happened. Thank you Brian, I mean sir. "" n nI had one dealer who reminded me of Dax Shepard from Punk'd, Employee of the Month, Idocracy. He was constantly hitting on some girlfriend of one of the player. When I reminded him that he missed paying me on my Come Odds he said in a loud voice ""Dude, can you blame me? Look at the rack on this girl. I want to CUM too. "" Priceless. The boyfriend didn't care because his girlfriend was making good money on the rolls and place six place eight. n nThis is one of the lowest limits on the strip for craps. I was going to hop on the blackjack tables until I saw the 6 5 payout on single deck. EWWWWWWWWWWWW! I will be returning on my next trip just to play here in hopes I can hang out with the classy dealers.",2
"I rarely write anything negative but we have to be factual. Great ambience and location, but service needs a little work. The food is slow and also not good. Among the 3 different ones we've ordered it was only the pretzels that was worth the credit. Hope they get better staff and service, as there are lots of bars in Mill Ave.",1
I actually found tisplace by accident. We tried to eat at a breakfast place near the same location but it was too full. I had always heard that Busters had amazing food and indeed it was wonderful. I had the Eggs Benedict and you actually get more food for the than some of my other favorite cafes in the same area. We will definately be back soon.,2
"What a disappointment yesterday. We wanted to have a late dinner and drinks after the football game and that wasn't possible at the Tempe z Tejas. I love the location in Scottsdale so we thought this would be a solid spot to patronize. n nWe were seated in the corner like they didn't want us there. But this allowed for us to watch the timeline and activities in the area. They started filling in the tables and actually moved other patrons after they had been seated so they could accommodate another table? Those folks were more polite, I felt this inconsiderate to their experience. On the subject of other patrons another table did better by getting their drinks from the bar. Our server was too busy standing at the server station, ""looking busy "". He wasn't, trust me, I was a server for years. Not a good habit when the computer is in guest view. n nThe female server in the area was on top of things and folks who were sat after us had drinks, cornbread and soup. We had asked for lemons twice to no avail, because our server never came back to our table by that time. The one thing we managed to receive was the ""hard day "" margaritas. These were over poured with alcohol and didn't taste good. n nIt came down to the unfortunate situation of snagging a manager from a runner. I informed him of the deplorable service and he offered to be our server. It was so long at that point I couldn't stay. It was insulting. The manager comp'd our drinks and said we were are free to go. Like we were being removed from prison. At this point I was so irritated I would have preferred a more professional phrase, such as I'm sorry for the poor service, etc. The server never introduced himself, never even looked us in the eye or took care of us and his other tables in the slightest. Here is your tip do not work in a college town at a place where people will come late at night if you can't be polite. It's part of the job. Maybe find a job where you don't serve people because you are not good at that.",1
"Food was below average, service is slower than steam off cold dog poop. For a chicken Caesar Club salad and bacon and cheese fries it took over 21 minutes from the time I paid. Then they screwed up the order and we got just a basic chicken caesar and they didn't give us a fork with it. Will never go there again.",1
"I was apprehensive about going here. I really didnt know what to expect. It was a solid buffet, nice spread, great service from our server and good quality of food. I wish I had tried the Village Seafood buffet instead, however walked or should I say waddled out of here satisfied. Id definitely consider going back!",2
"Oh man, someone get this girl a hotdog. I have not had one since I moved to Champaign. I am from the Chicago area, and a good Chicago style hot dog is hard to find down here. I went to Wonderdogs the other day for their Wednesday special Hot dog, fries, and a drink for 5. Not bad. The hotdog was not nearly as good as the ones in the city, but it will do while I'm living down here for a year. AND I am a weirdo who hates seeds on my bun. So I was very happy to see my hotdog resting in a seedless bun. Plus, the guy behind the counter was super nice. Overall if you're on campus, I recommend trying Wonderdogs.",2
"Brought my watch in for a simple resizing for only 8, very affordable . less then a week after receiving the watch the links broke while i was sitting in my office and I had to bring it back in. n nOVER two weeks later they have finally repaired the links, and they tried to charge me another 12 and they blamed me for breaking the watch. n nIt's a 900 watch, they clearly didn't size it properly and then they have the nerve to try and charge me when I told them it was their fault they threw critisism at me for being cheap then motioned to my girlfriend who was holding the 3 year old she nannys for and said ""looks like you could use the money "". After I called them out for being total DICKS they asked me to leave and never come back. NO PROBLEM THERE n nExtremely unporfessional and very rude employees. Never going to them EVER again. Just wanted my damn watch to fit, good thing there are a MILLION other jewlers who understand good service!",1
"I've seen 4 shows at the Smith Center including the opening night gala and Wicked. and I can't get enough! The architecture is absolutely gorgeous, the customer service is top notch and the acoustics are amazing. There's really not a bad seat in the house in terms of sound quality. n nFor those who say Vegas lacks culture just see one show here and I guarantee you will think otherwise.",2
Used a groupon prepaid copon for dinner. Service was very good after that not so good. Food was luke warm and the salad was just average. The Gyro plate was greasey and bland. For 9.00 it should have been much better. I have had Greek food at many places and this one is at the bottom of the list. I would pass on this one.,1
"I couldnt tell you if the fish was fresh or not because its covered in sauce. n nWhen you try omakase where they pick what they make for you they give you four things at once so if you dont like something, you try one of the other things and forget about not liking the first thing that you tried. n nsushi for the masses",1
"Old fashioned kind of place. Which means, reasonable prices, good service, tasty food in good quantities. I've only eaten breakfast here many times, and then was only hungry for a late light dinner.",2
"Cute, Unique, Friendly, Fashionable, REASONABLY PRICED and the owner is engaging and helpful. n nA HIDDEN GEM in Old Town Gilbert !",2
"Great gang, their off road knowledge and selection for either 2 or 4 wheel fans is second to none! By far the best KTM selection in the Valley.",2
Paying for vehicle registration or title transfer is never enjoyable. TSI makes it as pleasant as it can be. It is so dependable and consistent that I recommend to people to pay the extra. It is so worth it.,2
"We were planning on hitting the Beijing Noodle Cafe tonight, but sadly they are closed, so that will have to wait for another day. A quick check of Yelp showed us this place, well always being up for a new restaurant and just down the road it was a good substitute. n nWhen it comes to Thai food I base everything against Lotus Of Siam, a fantastic restaurant, except that unless you have reservations you will be lucky to get a seat. n n nAnyways, the food. n nVery very good, as anyone who has read my reviews knows, simple food done right will always win, it just amazes me how many places manage to mess up simple foods. n nFor the record. n nChicken Satay, the second best I have had, only beaten by those made by a Thai lady that used to work for me. n nChicken Pad Thai, a dish that should be great, but it seems to be murdered by a lot of places we eat at, tonight's was perfect. n nWe also had the Mongolian beef, now, for those used to the typical Chinese restaurant way of cooking it, you would probably wonder what had be brought out to your table, I certainly did, but I have to say, it was fantastic, the beef was succulent, the taste far out shown the presentation. n nLastly we had the Crispy pork with broccoli, to be honest, my wife snuck this in while I went to the restroom and I was not expecting much when it came to the table. However, while not may favorite dish of the night that would be the Pad Thai it was certainly a nice dish. n nThe service was outstanding, something I would expect from a way higher price range than this, both servers were on their A game tonight. n nSo would I recommend Stick E Rice ? Hell yes, we were no sooner out of the parking lot than I was on the phone setting up dinner with friends for later this week. n nI should also add, other users have commented on the music, during the dinner my wife and I were guessing at the original artists being covered, I never in my life thought I would here Pet Shop Boys ""Suburbia "" being covered, in a jazz way.But it sounded great.",2
"I like their all you can eat sushi better than their sushi lunch, but for that I like to go to Ninja 2 Go unless I can't go that far then this is a good choice. The food is fresh and well made and the service is great they always greet you when you come in and when you leave which I think it's nice. It's not too big or too small, if you decide to dine in during your lunch time you have to remember to tell them that you are limited in time or they take a little bit longer on their service but they work fast if you tell them when you arrive.",2
"With fairly high expectations, Switch failed to meet my standard for adequate food. The thrill of the changing room wore off and the food was subpar. I cannot possibly offer a restaurant above two stars that doesn't provide good food. The lobster bisque, ahi tuna and sea scallops were all bland and couldn't possibly have been fresh. I would suggest gambling at Encore just to see Switch change, but I would not recommend eating there.",1
"Awesome as always. This time we came in late and sat outside with another couple. We ordered the Antipasto Salad for two and it was perfectly prepared as always and very good. This time I decided to try the Beef on Weck which was AWESOME. It is a french dip on a special role made in house and the amount of beef given made this one of the best beef sandwiches I have had in this town. n nEverything else ordered was really good except the Chicken parmadoro which seemed to be made with too much garlic. It seemed like the garlic over powered what is normally an awesome dish. n nOther then that which is very minor for this place everything was awesome. From the bartender who was very personable and on his game to tour server who is always a great server with an amazing sense of humor. n nThe atmosphere here is made by the people working here and they are top notch, friendly, welcoming and plain amazing.",2
"Shocked that anyone would go to this. There should be a negative star rating. Just moved here from Chicago, so maybe I expect too much from street festivals but this was awful! The BBQ was not good at all, there were only 2 options and one of them actually RAN OUT OF BBQ halfway through. The lines for BBQ were like 50 people long. Then you get a shot glass to sample the beers and proceed to stand in a 10 person line for each single swallow of beer. Super lame. There were no bands or anything else fun. Then they have a cigar tent so I was inhaling nasty cigar smoke the whole time. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this on!",1
"mystery adventure is must do Sunday Thru Thursday. its great but its 3hrs long. i like the fact that it had something for everybody. you don't have to be a mystery junkie to enjoy the adventure. and for the price you really cant beat it. nothing in Vegas will keep you entertain for so long for so little, plus there's snacks to munch on while you try to look for clues. The one thing that is definitely fun is to determine what clues you need to solve the mystery and what clues you don't. you'll get to meet people and work as a team to solve the mystery. if your on a tight budget this is a must.",2
"It was ""under construction "" when I visited yesterday, but I enjoyed dining in their cantina nonetheless. n nGood quality from the chips and salsa to my chicken wrap. Reasonable lunch specials, and I am guessing an amazing atmosphere from the look of the work going on in the dining room. n nI shall return!",2
The customer service is lacking. Did not go above and beyond in anyway. They did not call to touch base with us as they stated they would. The finished product is acceptable except the headlights. They replaced one damaged during accident but didn't call and ask us if we wanted to replace the other for an additional charge. It would have been nice to have been offered the opportunity and it would have been an upsell for them. They just do not take the time to communicate during the process.,1
"MORE? How about a little LESS! n nThis place is disgusting. After one bite I already wanted to leave. The food taste old and had no flavor. I had to put hot sauce in my soup to get a taste. n nThe place didn't even look nice. It looked like a hospital cafeteria. n nWaste of money. The buffet at Treasure Island tasted much better than this restaurant, if that's what you can even call it.",1
"I wake up, head pounding, wondering where the hell I am. I glance to my left and see Liz passed out mouth open next to me. Aha Vegas. This means buffet. n nNow, let me tell you, 9 girls getting ready is not a fun time when you ony have two rooms. I was hungover, in dire need of nA My morning coffee nB A bottomless supply of mamosas nC Mass amounts of food nD All of the above. n nSo, after two hours of me pacing and complaining of the lack of speed from some hungover people we make our way to the Mirage. Buffet cost 25. Shit. I told Kelly would pay for her. This better be good for fifty bucks. n nIt was. There was everything! The waitress promptly brought us 9 mimosas and waters. Bottomless mimosas were included. I love it. I ate A panini, deep dish pizza, gelato, sushi, chinese noodles, mashed potatoes, crab legs, shrimp, chilaquilas, breakfast burrito, and washed it down with 20 mimosas. Yes 20. The lady was awesome. I would take a sip after she finished pouring and she would come back and fill the little that I had drank. Then Liz didn't want hers and I aqcuired two glasses. This turned into a competition between Kelly and I, who could drink the most before she left the table. because this lady would always refill. n nI love you lady. I asked you to come home with me but you wouldn't. But you ensured me to definitely come back.",2
Service was terrible. Could not imagine such a fine dining restaurant lacking service.,1
"I hadn't had much trouble from Sonic before, but the food today was awful. I had a craving for chili cheese fries and when I got the bag they had put the container sideways so it was basically upside down. On them they put the dregs of the chili sauce that was so salty it was awful. And it was microwaved! The interior of the mess was molten lava hot and the fries were dried out from microwaving. Total lack of caring. It was gross.",1
"Worst customer service EVER! None of them would even crack a smile and I was super nice to them. I asked the guy to razor my feet and he told me the stuff he used would be sufficient. Then when my nails were drying I notice my feet are still rough and dry so I show him. He gets all mad and when someone else stepped in to take care of it he was shooting nasty looks at me from his nail station. Not to mention it was the worst massage ever. Do NOT go to this place! It's awful. I will NEVER go here again. Go to La Vie nails just outside the mall. They are so nice there! n nAlso, while I was there I heard another customer get upset and say she would never be back. Looks like they make a lot of customers unhappy.",1
"The chips were pretty damn good and the food was made from good quality ingredients. n nI just can't believe I paid 10 for a fricking burrito. It wasn't even that big. For 10, I want a burrito I can eat for 3 meals. n nThey do have a really huge selection of tequilas though.",1
"I really, REALLY wanted to like this place. How can you hate on a place that is decorated with teddy bears? Seriously now. I'm like an overgrown she child, so this place should have been paradise for me. Instead, I left with a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively. n nIt took us ten minutes to be seated. The woman at the cash register up front wasn't the hostess I guess , so she left to find someone to seat us. We waited FOR E VER for someone to finally show us to a table. Then, we sat for another ten minutes after deciding what we wanted to eat for someone to come take our order. I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup to start. It was tepid at best and exactly the same consistency and overwhelmingly salty flavor as Campbell's Chunky soup. For my meal, I ordered pot roast. Over 50 of it was fat. The sides were pretty nasty as well. a hard and cold baked potato and burned vegetables. My fianc u00e9's turkey dinner was so bad that he left it untouched like it was an alien life form. n nThe service was the worst part. From start to finish, the waitress was surly and rude. It was like we were ruining her day by just being there. I really, REALLY tried to be nice, but it seemed like she was more mean the nicer I got. I couldn't WAIT to bolt out of there. n nSeriously, people. There are better diners in this city. Maybe I had a random bad experience, but besides the decor, there was nothing I liked about this place.",1
"The Church Brew Works in the former St. John the Baptist church on Liberty Ave is one of my absolute favorite restaurants anywhere. I've been here for lunch, dinner, happy hours, and special events birthdays and wedding rehearsal dinners . I don't even know where to begin. n nThey keep the place immaculate, and there really is no pun intended here. It's gorgeous. The atmosphere is unique, one could even say post modern. I could gush about the pleasure of having a tasty meal under a vaulting, airy ceiling with sunlight streaming through the stained glass windows. so I am. I was raised Catholic in Pittsburgh and attended both the school and the church of St. Kieran's right up the road from here and, although not particularly holy myself now, have been broken hearted by how many of the gorgeous churches in the city were shuttered by the ruthless bishop, who ironically seems to have followed me to DC. that's to say I think shutting down the spiritual centers of the inner city when they need them the most is more sacrilegious than turning one into a gorgeous restaurant and repurposing the building. n nI digress to an absurd degree.the gouda dip appetizer is to die for here. I crave it often it's that good. The pizza is truly delicious, and the Pittsburgh salad with chicken and fries on top is so much better than one could ever imagine just by thinking about that combo. I get it with ranch and use it sparingly because the chicken is so flavorful and juicy. Really, nothing here is bad I've had the pierogies in many of their various daily forms and could easily make meals out of them they're that good. They're ""real "" pierogies. Delicious. The chicken wrap was equally delicious, though I'm not sure if it's still on the menu. Everything is fresh and simply seasoned but still tastes very sophisticated. I've never had a bad meal here. n nThe Pious Monk beer is a must. A must! But if you don't drink alcohol, try their birch beer or ginger ale. They make it all right there. n nThe ice cream is so good I don't remember what's special about it, they use something left over from the brewing process like the sugar or something, but this with one of their absolutely delicious cups of coffee is the perfect way to end your meal. n nAmazing. I hope you'll love it. Another place I'd recommend without reservation to out of towners when I bring friends home to PGH with me I take them there and no one's been disappointed. n nOh, the outdoor patio is wonderful! It's intimate and comfortable.",2

"I visited for the first time 4 wks ago for a set of acrylics. Kahn did my nails. Because I didn't understand how he was applying the tips, I must have had a confused expression on my face because he started to explain that he does thing differently than everyone else and that I wouldnt find a person anywhere who does it like this. He said that instead of attaching the tips to the nail, he attaches it to the skin.HUH? I have had tips before and it was never done this way. n nSo a week later, one nail fell off! Two weeks after another nail fell off! Two and a half weeks later, a third nail fell off! n nThis has NEVER happened to me and I think if he would have applied the nails the normal way, this would not have happened. n nAnyway, I plan on stopping in today and I am requesting that my nails taken off and a new set reapplied by someone other than Kahn. n nI will update this entry after the visit. n nUPDFATE I went to salon today and talked to manager. she agreed to redo them. when the new guy was doing my nails he said i wasn't being charged for the redo which is what i thought because manager never said i would have to pay for a redo . when i checked out the girl told me that they were charging me 30! are you kidding me? If they werent going to make this right by doing it free of charge, then the LEAST i should be charged is for a fill in, not 30! n nI will never go back here.

"My boyfriend and I are house sitting in the area and were in the mood for Italian food the other night. Belfiore's had decent reviews, so we figured what the heck. What the heck, indeed. Although the bakery side was modest and somewhat welcoming, the restaurant side looks like it used to be a Kyoto Bowl with some Italian art thrown on the wall. n nIt was right around 8pm on Saturday night when we showed up, and there were 3 other tables with guests. Despite the low number of other patrons, our waitress although sweet forgot we were there after she served our drinks. n nI wasn't very hungry, and all I wanted was something along the lines of a capellini pomodoro with fresh tomato chunks, basil and garlic. The closest they had was tomato sauce. I should point out here that it was my boyfriend who found Belfiore's on Yelp, so I hadn't read the reviews and had no idea that their portions were so huge. It was like they had taken an entire box of pasta, cooked it, and scooped it on my plate and then opened a can of tomato sauce and dumped it on top. I really don't know how one can possibly screw up the easiest dish on the menu, but Belfiore's found a way. I could barely eat it. They could easily cut that dish in half, keep the price the same 10 and add fresh tomatoes and basil and still make a good profit. Their portions do nothing but add to the ever increasing American waistline. n nMy boyfriend's dish fared better penne with vodka sauce and shrimp although the shrimp was overcooked. n nThe salads that came with our meal were clearly prepped in advance on the plates, wrapped in saran wrap and stacked on top of each other. The only thing I liked was the roll.",1
"Great DMV office. It's split license and vehicle registration. The first time I've ever seen something like this. Anyways, the service is pretty quick and most of the workers are friendly. I finally got my driver's license after the third attempt. The examiner Alston was so gracious and helpful. I thank her so much for explaining what I did wrong the previous time. I got lucky and got her again. Passed with flying colors. I would go out of my way to go here for anything else, though I live alot close to the N Tryon location which is just as bad as the one on Arrowood .",2

"This review is only pertaining to the organization of the restaurant because, due to their lack of organization, I was unable to experience the food and wine at this new Madison establishment. n nWe had inquired about attending a multi course wine makers dinner with wine parings that was advertised via Grgich Hills winery. First, when we called to make reservations, the restaurant was confused and had it on their calendar for 10 29 even though the winery advertised 10 30. We eventually had to call the winery directly to get a straight answer. After a few different conversations, it turns out the dinner will be cancelled due to Rare's lack or organization and marketing of the event.

All were excellent. nService was prompt and the meal came out quickly, but no after service to refill water etc. was lacking.",2
The New York Steak was very tasty and I liked the East Coast feel of the place.,2
"Overpriced. I ordered steak. Nothing to write home about. Better, cheaper choices abound.",1
"Favorite Mexican Restaurant in the world. n nThis is about as classy as you can get in East Mesa I know, not a lot of competition in that category . They've finished the new location and came out with a whole slew of new recipes. My favorites include the flying saucer or the chicken mango salad. I've set a goal to try something new each time I go here and haven't been dissappointed with the new menu items yet. A bit pricey but with the new decor comes a new price tag. n nThere's a nice take out addition too for the lunch crowd.",2
"This gym is amazing. The workouts focus on High Intensity Interval Training, which is designed to give you the maximum calorie burn. Each work out is different and they are never boring. They are also never easy! I have been a member for almost a year and every workout comes with variations. There are modifications for easier and more difficult moves. When my lower back bothers me, I have always been given another modification or another exercise. But what really sets this place apart are the people. Both the trainers and the clients here are great. Everyone works together to motivate each other. If I miss a class I usually attend, people notice! There are family workouts on Sundays, and they often have events ranging from kickball to running club. They encourage the whole family to be active together.",2
"We headed here on Saturday night. I like the concept and the food sounded tasty. I was also excited based on the reviews. Unfortunately, the food for our large group trickled out slowly, and it was only mediocre. The server was kind, but overall not a good experience.",1
"This spa is my second favorite in Las Vegas. n nI came about an hour early before my treatments to use the facilities. They have the rain showers, large hot tub, steam room, sauna and a cold dipping pool. n nThey have nice amenities such as hair care, body lotion, shavers, hair ties, toothbrush, trail mix, juices, and tea. n nI've had two massages here and both times the male therapists were amazing and worked out the kinks as much as they could given the 50 minutes I booked. n nAfter the massage, I got a facial and it was so relaxing that I fell asleep, minus the part when the esthetician did the extractions. n nThe attendants were nice and cordial and asked periodically if I needed anything. The facilities itself are clean. n nYes I would definitely come back.",2
"One of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas. Five star property. Hotel rooms are suites. They always give you full amenities including bedroom slippers. Great customer service. Great food and bars. Drink service is always good when playing table games or slot machines. It almost, almost, makes it painless to lose.",2
"I first experienced these delicious cupcakes last year during the Asian Food festival and was hooked from the first bite! I've been to other premium cupcake places and enjoyed their offerings, but the alcohol fillings in SSC's cakes sets them apart. Coming from a family of drinkers I wasn't expecting to feel much of a 'bite' from the fillings as they claimed but was pleasantly surprised to feel it on the first taste. The cake quality is also as good or better than the other places, solid with minimal breakup and flavorful. I'm a cream cheese lover so I adore their cream cheese base for the frosting, and they don't overdo it on the spreading the other places tend to spread a bit too much frosting for my liking. There are currently plenty of flavors to satisfy any craving and they keep adding more as they hook up with other brands of liqour your favorite brand may show up someday. Finally, the owners Lisa Danielle are wonderful young women very cordial, professional and committed to the sucess of the product, not to mention quite attractive, a plus in my book n nAt 42 the price per dozen will be steep for some, but keep in mind that the ingredients are of premium gourmet quality and the cakes are made, baked and delivered fresh daily ensuring maximum taste and flavor. You most certainly will be getting what you pay for. n nI strongly urge you readers to give these cakes a try just don't get too drunk off them now, hear? though that might be hard given they're so good ",2
"Food was greasy and gross, couldn't eat the grease soaked potato cakes, sandwich had dry bread and hardly any beef the employees don't seem to care, this place blows!",1
"It has been over a year since I visited this fine establishment, but I still remember the nectar of the gods that they serve up here. They create what is perhaps the best beer that I have ever tasted. and in true micro brew fashion. And while I may not be able to describe the nuances of the flavor profiles. I like to think that I do know a great beer when I come across one! And I'd classify every beer that I sampled here on my 2 visits while in Montreal on the north side of great and fantastic. n nCome thirsty and every chance you get! Great bar, great service, with great conversation with the friendly locals. If you are looking to sample and discuss the beer with the staff then show up early to avoid the crowds.",2
"I award two stars because the bread is, indeed, fantastic. Other than that, I was underwhelmed by the pretentiousness. The decor is painfully cute. No, this is not what casual but sophisticated places look like in Europe, although communal tables are common overseas. The menu is very limited and each dish seems designed to wow with an ingredient one wouldn't expect. Why not just make something that tastes good? Why does it have to be ""different "" just to be ""different ""? n nI had the chicken salad. The chicken was good but there wasn't much of it. It was somewhat overwhelmed by mustard and the rest of the salad consisted of a pile of arugula and dates. Forgive me if I sound like a rube for never experiencing dates with mustard before. But I won't be doing it again. If the pizzas available at Pizzeria Bianco are also made here, that wasn't clear from the menu the day I visited. There was a pizza of the day, again with some unusual addition designed to turn heads. I'm sure the ingredients such as the fresh herbs and house made mozzarella are superb here as they are in Bianco's other establishments, but they SHOULD BE given the prices. n nGet the bread to go. Otherwise the main reason to dine here is to be seen somewhere that Phoenicians who never leave the Southwest think is European.",1
"As I've been making the rounds between different LV and NLV vets, I have learned that most vet experiences depend on the time of your visit, the doctor who sees your pet, the front desk service, and cost. When I review a clinic I do it with the understanding that I'm writing about my specific experience with specific doctors and staff. n nMy initial impression was that the office staff was frazzled and unorganized. But they were apologetic and friendly. The waiting room is one of the nicest I've seen in an animal hospital. n nAnother Bengal owner recommended that I visit Dr. Davis at Centennial Hills because Dr. Davis does not discriminate against Bengals. In addition, she is familiar with the breed. n nI admit that I always feel like I should put on battle armor before visiting a vet, but Dr. Davis was open to what I had to say and put me at ease. She was upfront with me and patiently answered all of my questions. She was professional but sympathetic at the same time, a skill that too many overworked vets lack. n nI agree that the prices here a bit more expensive than other vets, but not by much.",2
"I won't get into the quality of the food or anything else after the experience I had the FIRST time I went here. I had just moved in to the neighborhood, right around the corner no less. It was the first place my family and I thought we would try in the area. n nWe each ordered a slice of pepperoni and a soda. Their sodas come from a fountain but you don't get to fill it yourself. I get my soda and sip it. It's foul! Something is definitely wrong with their machine. It wasn't the normal issue that fountains have of distributing too much soda water in relation to the syrup. This was different. It was much worse. The soda had a strong chemical taste to it, and was not sweet. I go back to the counter and ask for another one, explaining that there was something seriously wrong with the one I got. The guy looks at me like I'm speaking Chinese and then asks me to wait while he gets his superior. He brings back the owner and I explain to her what is going on and ask for a replacement. She flat out says ""No "". I am taken aback. Confused, I think she must not understand the situation. I explain again. ""No, I can't "" is her response. I ask her to taste the soda, because the only explanation I can come up with is that she doesn't believe me. She refuses to taste it. n nI have never experienced anything like this in my life. First off, we all know that these sodas cost about 10 cents to the proprietor. That is why most restaurants let you fill your own. But what is really upsetting is that this goes beyond bad customer service. I did not receive a soda. That's how ""off "" it was. Yet I paid for it. I was ripped off, over a soda that costs them 10 cents. After eating my slice I had already paid for it , I walked out of the place vowing never to return. It's too bad, as the pizza is decent and the place is only 2 minutes from my house.",1
"It is OK, but really not all that good tasting. I don't care one way or the other about the manufactured ""healthy hype "".it is pizza and when I eat pizza, I just want it to taste good. Again, it is just OK, but truthfully, the Little Caesars 5 pizza tastes much better.",1
"Went there today for lunch and it was a really cool place with friendly staff and roll up glass garage doors opened to East Blvd, nice atmosphere, good chips and salsa. nUnfortunatley it was nowhere near the BEST fish tacos in Charlotte like someone had told me. My 4.00 Mahi taco only had a single finger sized piece of deep fried Mahi, raw corn tortilla, and just tasted ok. n nI'm sure it would be a fun place to get a drink and watch a game. n nCabo Fish tacos still has the best by far in my opinion.",1
"Cheba Hut was one of those ""must go to "" places on my list for when I moved back to AZ. Unfortunately it took me over a year to get there. I had a hankerin' for a sandwich last week so I decided to venture to my least favorite part of Mesa to see if it was how I remembered. n nI have to say that the whole ordering system is way more streamlined than it used to be. No more walking down the line while the person behind the counter asks if you want every condiment imaginable on your sandwich. You wait in a line to order while looking at the large menu posted on the wall, and when you get to the register the guy ringing you up asks what you want on it and rings you up accordingly. You pay and they bring it out to you. Instead of giving you a number, they give you a picture or character from a movie. Cute. n nI ordered the Jamaican Red with hemp cream cheese. One of my favorites from the past. When I ordered, the guy ringing me up let me know it was an extra charge for the cream cheese. Thank you! It was just as I remembered. Buffalo chicken, olives, jalapenos, cream cheese.and toasted?!?! Yum! I'm salivating just thinking of it now. They have an excellent selection of other sandwiches, salads, and treats. I didn't get one on this trip, but the rice krispee treats here are the best I've ever had besides homemade . Back in the day I used to get the southwest chicken salad, also known as the AZ Homegrown. It was my 1 but it's not on the menu anymore. Curious if the White Widow replaced it? Maybe I'll give that a try next. n nThis location has some seating so even when crowded you can most likely get a table or pull up a stool along the window. My meal came to just under 12. Ouch! Although a little higher in price than what I like to spend on lunch, it won't deter me from going back.",2
"This place is expensive, and the food is just average. Me and my gf spend over 45 and we both felt hungry after eating there.",1
"Here on a business trip, just wanted a quick dinner. Went at around 6 00 and seated immediately at the bar. Bartender great, efficient and friendly. Made a couple of suggestions.took Rising Sun. Great burger, cooked exactly as ordered. Drink never got below half full. n nAll in all, great quick service and great food.all for under 25.00 with a 25 tip . Will definitely be back. Very pleased with experience.",2
"we had Fintastic for over 7 years to service our reef tank. at first we were very happy with the service even we had to survive several major floods due to poorly trained technicians for the last three or four years there was constant change of technicians. The good ones were leaving since they were not very happy in their workplace and the new ones had very little knowledge about anything except for cleaning the aquarium glass . For most of our questions their response was that we need to call someone at the store who knows all of that. From time to time the manager came to set lights or controller. Even we had several technicians who caused major flooding in our house but it was the latest new technician and the response from the company which caused us to fire Fintastic. in a couple of months he was servicing the aquarium we had several broken pieces of equipment and several small floods until he ""repaired "" the last leak and lefy without checking anything. We had water poring for all day long which shortened our AC and flooded our basement . On our frantic calls to Fintastic all we could get was just that they were aware of the situation and since they didn't have anybody to come and check on things right now somebody would be coming in 5 hours. After 4 hours of waiting owner of the company called and said that nobody was going to come since their company wasn't equipped to deal with all this mess. He offered us a phone number for another company to take care of the mess and told us that somebody would swing by to take a look tomorrow or before the weekend. on our question if he talked to the technician to find our what happened he just told us that he couldn't reach him since the technician worked as a landscaping guy and took care of our aquarium in his free time. At this point we were speechless. If we wanted to have a landscaping guy to take care of our aquarium we would have but Fintastic advertised itself as top notch knowledgeable maintenance company. After clean up and replacement costs us around 6000.00 fintastic declined to pay for any of that saying that their insurance just took I big hit from the job they did earlier so they couldn't afford to deal with us. Please anybody who has Fintastic now to service their aquariums be aware that their technicians are not properly trained often they are just amateurs who like to tinkle with their own aquariums which is not bad but in most cases they don't know more than their own aquarium and have no clue ho 1w to maintain more complex equipment. Also since the company is growing so much they feel that they do not have to take care of their customers and can afford to loose some of them. So when something happens you will be on your own to clean up the mess.",1
"I adore Wedge and Bottle. I'll start with the 3 cheese sandwich because I have eaten it a lot. A lot, a lot. Why? Probably because I love horseradish and cheese and together they are magical. If you're feeling particularly hungry, get it along with the tomato soup for a gourmet comfort food combination. Other reasons to love Wedge and Bottle include, but are not limited to the ever changing selection of quality wines and cheeses and the knowledge of Krista and Troy to help you choose among them the selection of craft beers and ciders the grocery where you can get small batch chocolates, quality crackers, spreads, salts, honey and so much more the wine and cheese of the month club, which I have had the good fortune to take part in 6 months running and have not once been disappointed in the frequent and affordable wine tastings.I could go on like that for quite a while. There is always something new next to our favorites and we are always welcomed with a smile. n nGo here often. You won't regret it.",2

"Compromise is an important component in every relationship. Except food. n nThis buffet, located in the Suncoast casino, is a compromise in every sense. There are far better buffets out there, such as Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood, Studio B at M Resort, and the Cosmopolitan's new Wicked Spoon blatant plug there . If it's not in your budget, there's the Carnival World Buffet at Rio. Don't want to go to the strip? Try Feast Buffet at Red Rock. Don't feel like driving all the way out to the 215 and Charleston? You've pretty much compromised your way into this. n nWhen you walk in, you'll notice the average age of the clientele is 800. Factor in the staff and it brings it down to 780. The place is small, the staff is not always friendly, or present, and you feel like ordering a Metamucil the moment you walk in. n nThe food is meh. Decent roast beef and pizza. Small salad bar. Cold fried catfish. Really? The only time catfish should be cold is when you fish it out of the water. I waited for ten minutes for someone at the carving station, and he only came out after I reached for the knife and fork to serve myself. My waitress didn't refill my drinks until conveniently enough I was ready to leave and tip out. n nRedeeming qualities It's cheap and on the Westside. n nSo take your chance with this buffet if you want to just remember there's better out there.",1
"Worst customer service ever! nWe entered Fridays one hour before the D Backs game. We went into the bar and found two open bar tables. Before sitting down we asked a waiter if the table was available. He said yes, and we sat down. No one came to take our order for 10 minutes so we went to the bar and ordered drinks. A waiter came by after we received our drinks and gave us menus. Another waiter came by with more menus. After we had been at the table for 20 minutes, a hostess came over to say the table was reserved for the wait list and we had to move the other table that was open when we came in was still open and there were at least eight tables open in the dining area. We told the hostess that a waiter told us we could sit there and she said it didn't matter. We asked for the manager. He reiterated that we had been told by a waiter that we could sit there, he didn't care. We asked if we could finish our drinks, since the other bar table was still vacant. He said no. We had to finish our drinks standing to the side of the bar since you can't take them into the stadium . The table we were evicted from was never cleared or seated and when we left there was no wait list for seating.",1

"Ok pretentious Yelper's do not read or bother writing a review. This place is what it is.AWESOME Asian food at a reasonable price. If you want a fine dining experience this is not it. If you want consistently tasty, quick take out, or a casual meal at an affordable price this is your place. A small family 'hole in the wall' but the food is alway good, hot, and tasty. They make me feel very welcome everytime I'm there and I don't mind sitting down to eat here if you take a laid back approach.enjoy your saki and Tsing Tsoa wait patiently for your food and enjoy the company around you. Not everything needs to be so proper or uptight. I don't want someone checking on me every five minutes. If you haven't been there please do not let the bad reviews scare you away.

I was asked to come in and talk to them about animal care so I wanted to have a special treat for them afterward. n nNot only was the staff incredibly nice, they even called a couple times between the time of order and the date of pick up for confirmation and any possible changes I may have had. I really appreciated that. n nOn the day of pick up, I was so surprised! The idea I had in my head was really cute, but what I got from them surpassed all my expectations!

"This restaurant is a hidden gem inside mirage hotel and casino. There is a bar like vibe, so as soon as you walk in you'd expect it to be more like a bar than a restaurant. n nUpon being seated, you will have like 2 4 waiters constantly checking up on you. n ni ordered the tomahawk steak. it was around 60. Might I say, this was one of the most juciest and tender steaks ive ever had it melts in your mouth. expensive though. n nThe appetizers weren't that good. I tried the baked mac and cheese. Did not like it.",2
"Tried their delivery for the first time and will not order from them again. Food arrived with sauce from spaghetti leaking into the bag and all over some of the other food. Meatballs on the spaghetti were good, but the pasta was overcooked and the sauce just tasted like tomato sauce out of a can. Wings were undercooked. Garlic bread had very little taste. pointless to eat it. However, the salad was tasty with lots of meats, cheese, olives and peppers. We didn't try the pizza, but based on this experience, we won't be back to Barros.",1
"Man is it hard to find good sushi in AZ n nAlmost as hard as finding good Mexican x x n n nHouse Modern does fusion sushi AKA lots of spicy sauce and mango dressing and nigiri up to my standards and will be a place I will frequent in Mesa for my maguro needs. n nDefinitely not the best when compared to Cali sushi joints but is leagues better then the other places I have eaten in Arizona.

"I am still shell shocked from my extremely poor and disgraceful experience here. First I was overcharged for my to go order when I picked up some food. The polite lady fixed it. Then I got home and found out that they gave me meat pies and not cheese. I have stopped eating meat, so was not exactly happy when I bite into a pastry filled with frozen meat. When I called the manager, he said I could come back and pick up the cheese pies. I was not going to go back uptown. I asked him to deliver them and he said no, he was short staffed. I requested a refund and he said, he can't do that over the phone. n nThe next day I had to go in out of my way to get a 10 refund. I explained to the manager that I was not happy with the customer service. He said, ""you don't believe in mistakes? "" I said yes of course, but I believe in good customer service to redeem it. I didn't get what I ordered and was inconvenienced to come back in to get a refund. n nThe manager said, ""where are you from? "" WHAT does ethnicity matter? To my surprise, he said. yes YOU PEOPLE LIKE TO COMPLAIN. OMG. I told him that is racist! He said he did not care. I said, I was brought up in the USA and my ethnicity does not matter. He repeated, yes you ppl like to complain. YOU PEOPLE!?!? I told him I am not happy with the customer service, and I will write a review. After saying that, he stopped and said now I am not giving you a refund at all. n nI cannot believe that this overpriced place is letting such an ignorant racist person run the restaurant. n nOverall the quality of the food is pre prepared, extremely overpriced and now disgusting customer service. n nFollow my other reviews for quality Mediterranean food in Charlotte. There is a reason this restaurant is always empty.",1
"I gave them 4 stars on my first visit for dinner AYCE.and I was hoping that it would be as good for lunch AYCE.no such luck. It was atrocious, revolting excuse for sushi. n nWhen I walked in, I had a bad feeling when I saw two latino looking sushi chefs at the tsukeba. Not that I have anything against non japanese itamae, but from my fairly vast experience.it's not a good sign in general and boy was I right. n nSince I'm Japanese, I don't order any rolls. I always go with straight nigiri, none of those yum yum sauce, fancy rolls bulshit and here are what's wrong with their ""sushi "". n n1 It was ugly. Cuts of fish were uneven, too small, and were just very asymmetrical and poorly balanced with rice. When you have two pieces and they look so different, there is a significant lack in their sense of aesthetics, and more importantly, utter luck of skill. n n2 Sushi rice was horrendous. To make things worse, there were 2 sushi ""chefs "" and they seem to be using very inconsistent sushi rice. One was soft and overly sticky, and the other was dry and hard. Neither of them had proper vinegar flavor, and was too bland to be called ""sushi rice "". They obviously have no idea or skill to make proper sushi rice, which is just as, if not MORE important than the fish that goes on it. n n3 Utter lack of nigiri skill. Sushi rice was too hard. You had to chew it. That is what happens to amateurs and newbies who do not have the proper skills to maintain shape of nigiri while having enough air within it so that if falls apart in the mouth. n n4 The wasabi issue I was embarrassed for them. My first order of nigiris had no wasabi. So I asked the waitress non japanese that I need to have wasabi in the sushi. She comes back 2 minutes later that ""most people "" don't want wasabi so the ""chefs "" cannot put wasabi in the nigiri. Let me repeat ""THE CHEFS CANNOT PUT WASABI IN THE NIGIRI "" n nLet me make this straight. In Japan, the sushi chefs will occasionally make UPON REQUEST nigiris WITHOUT wasabi for little children, I mean like kindergarden aged kids. Never do they even consider NOT putting wasabi for adults. So I tell this non Japanese waitress that I don't care what ""most people "" want. I want wasabi in the nigiri so that I don't have to peel the fish off of rice and have to put it on there, and it is the PROPER way to make a nigiri. So she goes back and talks with this ""chefs "" and they finally comply with my ""request "" to make a proper nigiri WITH wasabi. n nIt's very unfortunate that whoever the Japanese sushi chef is there allows these ""sushi chefs "" to let these joke of a sushi out to customers under their roof. I asked the waitress if there are any Japanese chefs at lunch time and she says that it depends on their schedule, sometimes yes, sometimes not. Well if a real chefs can't be there to properly supervise these jokers then they might as well close down the restaurant instead of allowing these atrocious nigiri's out to the customers who may have the palate and knowledge of what a real sushi should be like. n nThe management should be embarrassed with what went on today. If people think that this kind of atrocity is sushi, then I am truly saddened. There are better restaurants with real japanese sushi chefs in this town who serve decent AYCE sushi. But if people have numb enough palates to keep going here then so be it.",1

"The Skinny the chocolate cake was pretty good, the other stuff was not that great 2 , service is exceptional the owners are eager to help 4 , value was okay, nothing exceptional paid 3.99 for tres leches and 2.99 for a slice of cake. n nCame here because I heard they sold strawberry tres leches cake. So I meandered over their way. n nFirst of all, they do have a deal going on currently where if you buy 2 pieces of the same cake, you get one free. Also, there's currently a discount for ordered cakes. n nUnfortunately when I went, there wasn't much selection in the bakery case. The lady at the counter was pretty nice and helpful. I ordered a piece of german chocolate cake and strawberry tres leches. After I ordered that, I asked if my purchase qualified for the promotion but the lady said no. Seeing my disappointment, she gave me a free croissant fresh from the oven on my way out. n nTo be honest, I was driven mad by the smell of the croissant that buttery aroma wafting through car is intoxicating. Problem was, the croissant itself wasn't that good. The croissant, albeit nice and flaky on the outside, was too dense on the inside. This suggests that the dough was not properly made croissant dough has to be kept cold to retain the integrity of the butter layers to get the flake . n nI took a look at the tres leches at home and was concerned. There were a bit of fuzzy looking strawberries on top of the tres leches cake. Like as in three pieces of strawberry were looking kind of moldy on top of the cake. Despite this, my hubby and I did try the cake whatever doesn't kill ya makes you stronger . It was okay nothing special. The flavour of strawberry came through but the texture was too soggy for us after sitting in the milky topping for too long. n nFinally, the chocolate cake. The actual cake itself was good. It had a nice texture and tasted like a nice semi sweet chocolate cake. However, the frosting was not appetizing. I think it's more of a textural issue for me. I found it too thick and gummy for my taste. n nIf only their baked goods were as good as their service, I would be back here in a heartbeat.",1
"Great place. Love the atmosphere, somehow dim but well lit, very warm feeling and interesting to look around the room without being chaotic. Fits the street perfectly too, St Paul is a great place to walk through small galleries and shops in the Old Port of Montreal. n nThe music is great too. Jazz bands typically led by beautiful and talented francophone women. I definitely recommend sitting upstairs so you can enjoy the live music. n nThe food is excellent as well. No bad choices from my experience, but I think the lamb is the best I've had. There's a full page of lamb on the menu and it's their specialty. That being said I'd have a lot of things there that aren't lamb, and I've never been disappointed. n nAnother great thing is that they work to get you in. I showed up with my wife for New Years without a reservation and though they were jammed they made it work. They had to speed up our service a bit, but let us know before hand what to expect, and didn't push us at all during the meal. n ni really have nothing but great things to say, and i recommend this place to everyone I know who's going to Montreal.",2

"2 stars because i like the food. Service was OK, but none of the employees were happy at all. Also, coming from a chefs view, that place needs a better kept storage system, just saying. Seeing ceaser dressing caked on the pans are NOT appealing.",1
"The wash was less than ok. I quit Terrible's for the same experience here. Inside, didn't bother to vac the crumbs on the seats, mats had crumbs. didn't swipe the drink cup holders. They cleaned the inside windshield and top of dash but didn't bother to wipe down the instrument panel, steering wheel areas, etc. On the outside didn't wipe down the white wheel wheels and other details like that. I hope I caught them on a bad day because I like having a carwash close to home. I'll give them one more try and that's it. Otherwise it's back to Freddy's who have yet to give me a bad wash, even if I have to drive a bit further. They are overpriced too.",1
"Really nice waitress, borscht that is amazing. Bring cash. Have had problems using visa.",2
Just awful. I ordered a dirty martni because their logo has a martini glass on it. I figured that's what they specialize in. I asked for it to be chilled with 2 olives. Well my order must have been too complicated because they served it in a beer glass. Nice and warm. No olives. I chalked it up to maybe a miscommunication. Some how. So instead of seeing the signs and leaving I ordered some food. Do not get their lump crab Mac and cheese. They are really just serving TUNA. I do not recommend this place for food or drinks.,1
Very expensive! Very little portions! Oysters smaller than a quarter! Only positive is the presentation is beautiful. Expect to leave broke and hungry!,1
"Location Tucked away on Duluth, just off of St. Denis head east . The closest subway is Mont Royal or you can try your luck with street parking. n nThe place Teeny tiny, but it's got BIG energy. The space is nothing fancy but it offers up a chill, comfortable vibe. The guys who run this place also have excellent taste in music so you don't need to worry about having to listen to elevator music or that pop crap. n nThe goods Honestly, I could write a short novel about how goddamn good the sushi is here, but I won't. All you need to know is that SS serves up top notch cuisine using quality ingredients and everything is made upon order. I tried the tasting menu that included such goodies as the Bob Marley, the Beatles, the Madonna and the Michael Jackson, among others. The starter was salmon sashimi in a sake reduction. Jesus, it was good. Our second dish was the 'Christmas tree' a lovely concoction of seafood served on a rice cracker. Our waiter Ali hope I spelled that right! , told me the present wasn't on the bottom but rather, on the top and he was right. It was so incredibly flavourful that I could feast on this alone. The grand finale was a beautiful sushi platter and every item on it rocked. Hello can I move in? n nService Phenomenal. Ali, Saeng, Ralph and our host whose name I unfortunately didn't get, were amazing. You can't ask for friendlier people to accompany a wonderful meal. I had a great chat with the guys and they let me know that they were basically a group of childhood friends who decided to work together. They really seem to love what they do and it's obvious that they mesh well. A huge white gangsta shout out to these fine gents. n nPrice point Super affordable the tasting menu is 22 tax in, per person. n nSo. What are you waiting for? Go! But be warned you'll need a reservation on weekends. This place is too cool for school.",2
"This was so bad. I ran in to the house to write this review! We went to the restaurant because of a promotion they were running for the High School . NEVER AGAIN! nI ordered the wings, which were okay. Not great. My wife ordered the burger, well done. it came to the table red. My other daughter ordered wings with Pub Chips. The wings were okay, but the pub chips were soggy and underdone. nWe would have pointed this out to the waitress. HAD WE SEEN HER! She came by a couple of times and I tried to get her attention, but she obviously was not terribly interested in checking on us. No drink refills. no checking with us. My wife asked to have the Burger removed from the check when we finally did catch her, since we were all done eating. She was less than personable after we requested the burger be removed. nI can only assume that the people in this very trendy neighborhood simply don't want to leave the neighborhood to eat. I can't believe they are going to have a long term future given the food and service.",1
"Maren was amazing, hands down the absolute best in town! I would recommend her to anyone who wants to look fabulous! I had an up do done for a formal event and I was receiving compliments all night long and the next day after sleeping on it. n nShe asked me to bring a couple of photos in and she was able to take the pieces I liked most in each and created a masterpiece! Along with her talent in hair she was a blast talking to and I really enjoyed my time. I live in AZ now but would drive to Vegas for her to do my hair. n nHIGHLY RECOMMEND! You will not be disappointed!",2
"As a Diamond card holder of the Total Rewards program with Harrah's, I get lots of offers for free rooms in Vegas, including Paris. I love to stay here and it always feels like ""home "" for me on the strip. Love the location and the service is always consistently good. I especially like that this casino is not HUGE, but just big enough as compared to Ceasar's where I find myself wandering in circles at night looking for the right tower and elevator to just get to bed! Wait.maybe that has something to do with 12 hours of consistent drinking.hmmm.ok, well. . I love the red rooms at Paris and have also stayed in the Penthouse suite a few years ago which was a nice treat and a comp upgrade . The Diamond Lounge is nice because it's easily accessible and they have hot apps in the afternoon and always free cocktails. n nI'll sum it up with Le Paris est magnifique!",2
"Dropped in hoping for dinner last night or rather what I thought would be dinner. nWhile I hate waiting for a table, and there always seems to be a wait here, I liked the text message notification alerting table availability. nMy companion and I headed to the bar where there was no seating available. There were two high top tables on the patio adjacent to the bar. We asked a server if the table's were available and she advised that on the weekend they were seated by the hostess and she was unsure how they were being handled on a Tuesday night? nWe confirmed with the hostess that these tables were first come first served and took the seats under the very messy tree. Nothing like small leaves in your hair and food. No wonder they were available! nAfter about 10 minutes sitting unattended we lassoed a waiter. He acted more than a little put out that we found him rather than the other way around. nWhile the bar food, nachos, was edible it was served cold. The melted cheese had already congealed by the time it reached us. That was dinner, there was no further waiting for a table where actual dinner was served. nBottom line, for me, is the entitled Arcadia scene is not for me. The food here, is edible. The valet parking is unnecessary. The wait, because of un bussed tables at least on the patio was unnecessary. nThere are other more civilized places in this town to spend money. I won't be back.",1
"I have to say, after reading the reviews I was very disappointed by the Yelp community. This place should not have 4 stars. I think that even 2 stars is being generous. I had high hopes for this place but they sizzled to the floor moments after I walked in. n nWe went to Lola's on a Friday evening. It was busy like most restaurants in Vegas are on Friday so I don't hold it against the establishment. What most people don't realize is that this is a TINY restaurant. There are not very many tables at all. It is insanely loud too. The table we sat at was not even and we had to constantly shift weights on the table to keep it level. Our order was taken pretty quickly after we arrive and we ordered some oysters for starters. We use to live in coastal Washington so when a restaurant has oysters on the menu, we typically order them for the nostalgia they bring. Our oysters were more than broiled, they were burned and hard to chew. This is frankly one of the worst oyster experiences I have ever had. Oysters should never be hard to chew. There was liquor in them either. Even broiled oysters should have a liquor even if it is just a bourbon or butter based sauce, it needs to be there. They cost us 12.49 for a plate of inedible chew balls from the sea. They were tiny too like the size of dimes for the oyster meat or, at least what was left of the oysters after the kitchen got their fiery hands on them! Because I understand that not every dish is created equally I still held my hopes high for the main course. n nThose hopes were drowned by the 50 minute wait time from appetizer to entree. We watched guests that were seated after us be served their dishes well in advance of us. We really felt ignored. Our waitress filled our water glasses once during the entire night even though we were there a few hours. n nI ordered the Catfish platter which on the menu has a number 3 beside it, indicating there would be 3 fillets. Because I spent a lot of time in the South and I love ""bronzed "" catfish I ordered mine to be the same. I must note that bronzed fish in no way translates to dried, black, inedible fish. When my plate finally arrived it had one very blackened piece of fish on it. My fish was so dry I quit eating shortly after I started. The seasoning was over salted as well. The waitress never came to ask how my dish was either. I was very disappointed. For one piece of dried out horrible fish, it racked up the bill another 15. My fiance ordered the the Shrimp Creole 15.99 and his shrimp were also over cooked but not to the point where they were inedible. So, he shared with me. My daughter ordered a plain Caesar salad 8.99 because there were no children's options and she is a vegetarian this place is NOT vegetarian friendly at all they actually make a point of hinting at that on the menu most things are non vegetarian and they make no acceptations or substitutions! God forbid some grits not have chicken stock in them. n nWe ordered two glasses of wine and were given the wrong type of wine or a very poor substitution for what we ordered. The sodas are also pretty expensive so make sure you are prepared to spend 10 15 on just a few glasses of coke if you order this. Our bill went over 100 which is sad since 1 2 of the items we ordered were cooked wrong and even things we could not eat. n nIt's been a few weeks since our visit here and I still have eater's remorse. We wont come back to eat here ever again. We're still on the hunt for a good Cajun place in Vegas sighs ",1
"The only reason I ever go to Nates is because it's walking distance to my house and they play hockey on some of the TVs. Food is good for bar food, service is usually sub par, from both the servers and bartenders. The only people that are really treated well are the regulars. Almost every time I go there my drink is empty and I have to wave the server down to get any attention. Better bet is to go down the strip mall to Valle Luna. Their bar is by far superior, both service and food.",1
"I found this yoga studio on yelp and I love this place. I have been to most of the classes at all different times, and haven't had a problem with a teacher not showing up, like the previous reviewer. The studio is located in the Lamar Spa, in a private studio. I have done yoga for a couple of years now, but just at home from DVDs. The studio is wood floored, bright, and all equipment, mats, bolsters, blocks, etc., are provided. The teachers are attentive and knowledgeable. I usually rush in frazzled and stressed from my day, and leave feeling centered and calm. This place is everything I had hoped to find when looking for a yoga studio.",2
"Short review I ordered it level 4 spicy, it had not a hint of heat. Both noodle dishes I ordered, Pad Thai and Pad See You were kind of boring. I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is.",1
"I live in the DC metro area, so I am not used to being around people smoking in restaurants bars. I hate cigarette smoke, but given the area it's not unusual I will disregard that complaint for this review. nSweet Jeebus I love me some Nadine's. I love the divey ness, when you drive by it looks more like a shed than a bar or restaurant. You can watch your food being made, and they have delish specials. n nI had the most amazing fried chicken club sandwich a special and my husband had a burger. Food was top notch and very reasonably priced. We aren't in Pittsburgh often, but when were are there, it's our first stop.",2
Food here is good. Service is bad and the people are rude and also very dumb. Hi hoh!,1
"Starting Off The Night. They forced me to return to my hotel room.not at The Belagio, Back at Bally's More Than A Quarter Of A Mile away.for not wearing pants instead of wearing dress shorts. They offered me a pair of their own pants which in and of itself seems like a violation of the health code. Who knows whose been in those pants This declined my party of 9 to a party of 5 until me and one other member of my party could return to the restaurant 30 minutes later at which point everyone was starving and contemplating dining here. n nThe food is average nothing really stood out, the price is centrally based on the contents of each dish. n nThis place only earned two stars. I recommend walking another few yards. And eating at FIX.",1
Bad service. I ordered orange chicken n it looked as if i ordered white rice as the main entree. Totally skimped me on my meal. Not worth the price.,1
"I had my hair cut by Mark at Vidal Sassoon yesterday, and I'm so pleased with how easy my hair is to manage today that I'm yelping. I've had many experiences where my hair will look good right after a cut, but when I style it myself later everything goes to hell. Not this time, my cowlick has been tamed. It's like magic! n nThe haircut experience itself was excellent. Vidal has a very pleasant and comfortable atmosphere, and Mark took his time with the cut. I feel that a proper haircut should take some time and thought, and that's exactly what I got here. Highly recommended!",2
"I needed a new bite valve for my generic CamelBak at 8 PM on the night before a hiking camping trip. n nAt first I was a little disappointed I couldn't just buy a new bite valve.but they do carry them for the CameBak brand bladders, but not for my generic one. I ended up buying a whole new CamelBak bladder. n nAfter my trip I was really glad I just boughtt it because it is awesome, and was much better than my old one. The new CamelBak water reservoirs are legit, although those kudos also go to CamelBak.but anyway. n nI thought the staff was friendly enough to review a chain. I doubt people care about the reviews for stores like Big 5, Sports Authority, Sports Chalet, etc. because they're all chains but I cared enough to provide positive feedback for this location. I was here late, probably as they were hoping to get wrapped up for the night and they were nice and genuinely wanted to help out. n nI was even able to buy my Tonto recreation pass and stickers for my watercraft here too. They sell trout stamps, permits, etc. n nThanks for bailing me out at 8 PM and being nice about it, Big 5 on Hayden Road. I'll be back.",2
"This place used to be really good. However, the customer service has really gone downhill. After making an appointment, I wasn't seen for 45 minutes AFTER my appointment time. The front desk girl didn't even give me a heads up when I checked in that they were running behind. Other clients were complaining and although the front desk girl apologized there was no acknowledgement from the owner, discount given, or any type of compensation to make up for the long wait. n nI'd suggest they call clients to let them know if they're running that far behind or at least tell them upon check in. Some sort of 'I'm sorry' compensation would be appreciated too. With so many nail salons around you'd think customer satisfaction would be a priority. I won't be going there again.",1
"What a nice treat! We were seated inside quickly and served quickly. Our server Jeanine was pleasant. I ordered the steel cut oatmeal and it was cooked PERFECTLY. My husband's Scrambled Eggs and Lox was delicious. We both enjoyed the coffee, served in bright, cheery yellow mugs. Our neighbors had ordered the Lobster Eggs Benedict and the Baguette French Toast and loved their breakfast as well. n nHighly recommend this pleasant spot in the Wynn. n nPS Had a little giggle after seeing the very professional hostesses in hot pink suits talking on ""secret service "" microphones, but they were extremely efficient!",2
"More buffet quality, than cooked to order. I've never been impressed.

"I CANNOT resist a bakery. I had to stop in here my 2nd day staying at the M Resort. nThe prices are reasonable. I had to get my hubby something from here since I was staying at the hotel for work. nIn the mornings, the selection is not as vast. The bottom shelves were pretty empty with only a handful of cupcakes to pick from. Plenty of seats inside they serve coffee as well. n nI ended up getting the Sticky Pecan Roll 2.75 and an Italian donut 2.75 . They're a pretty good size. The Italian donut is covered with cinnamon sugar and inside is the most delicious filling like a creamy egg custard which wasn't too sweet. OMG. DROOL ",2

"this place is freakin awesome. run by asians it seems. very flexible with order. i got two veggie skewers, a ton of tasty grilled chicken, and rice, for only like 7.50. i will def come back again. friendly staff. n nOnly negative is that it's a little bit difficult to find. just look for the big orange HOME DEPOT sign on the left, if you're heading north on rainbow. n ni just finished eating the meal and it was amazing.",2
"I'm usually a regular at the Cerritos, CA location, but this locations beats out the CA location because they have REVERSE happy hour! n nI've never been disappointed in any of the items I've ordered.

"If I could give less stars I would. Long's ruined a brand new shirt I brought in to get rid of the shipping wrinkles. At fist glance, there were a few light pink spots on the front of my cream blouse that the clerk said were already there. I know this was a lie, because like I said, this was a brand new shirt. I took it out of the bag and looked on the back and the entire back was pink! I'm sure I would have noticed that when I brought it in! After arguing with him for 15 20 minutes he agreed to try and get the spots out for free. The whole time accusing me of bringing it that way. They have horrible customer service and besides this one issue of them ruining a shirt and blaming me, the clothes come back looking just ok. I will never use them again and will spread the word to stay away!",1
This place was awesome! We met a promoter at the casino in the hard rock hotel and he got us in free and gave us free drink tickets. The venue is beautiful and the music was great. There was a good mix of male and female on the dance floor. This is the best nightclub we've been to so far. Much better than Marquee.,2
"Normally I LOVE CHIPOTLE! Alas tonight was a total let down! n nSo I havent had Chipotle in a very long time, and after getting my brows done by Glenn at Sumita, and rocking out in Forever 21 my little and I were hungry. Now I have been trying soooo hard not to eat here bc of the calorie factor but I broke down and got a chicken burrito. n nI walk in and its like 30 mins to closing time so its pretty dead and theyre cleaning up. So I go and order, chicken burrito with pintos, hot salsa, cheese, crema, and lettuce. Pretty easy yea? Well She rang me up, I grabbed some salt and took my burrito to go. When I was in line I didnt like the way the chicken or beans looked, I shouldve taken that as a sign! n nI get into my car, and normally I dont do this but I got my burrito our and salted it and mixed it. I took a bite and was totally sad. The beans were a weird texture, the chicken was tasteless and dry, and the guacamole tasted like only avocados and no seasoning. I was super sad! I mean, Ive gone to many Chipotles and haven had a bad burrito or bowl! This one was a sad excuse! Im gonna chalk it up to it was almost closing and the ingredients had probably been sitting there a little. n nAnywho, the customer service was amazing, you can tell they were super ready to blow that Popsicle joint. n nWill I go back? Probs not to that Chipotle, its a lil more expensive bc of location and I have had better burritos at the one on Lake Mead, sorry for cheating on you by going to a diff location.",1
"I'm a fan of this spot. I've tried the Cajun Stir Fry, Shrimp and Grits, Coffee, Cookies and a few other items. The spice in the Cajun Stir Fry is damn good and my family loves the Sweet Potatoe Frys. I'll be back again to try something different. Keep up the good work!",2
A careful selection of high end items. The meat department has a pretty spectacular display of beef and pork filets and seafood. The spice aisle was also very impressive. I will keep this on my list of places to go for hard to find items or when I need a fresh perspective on grocery shopping. But I probably won't shop here on a regular basis because it's pretty darn pricey.,2
"I really want to like this place. A local business in Ahwatukee, what's not to love? I've been there three times two lunch sandwiches and one breakfast sandwich. One lunch sandwich was great, yet on the next visit the amount of turkey was significantly less. I sent an email lamenting the inconsistency, but never heard back. This morning I stopped in for a breakfast sandwich, consisting of a couple eggs, sausage, cheese, and served on a croissant. Sounds yummy, yes? But sadly, the sandwich was totally lacking in flavor. I'm not sure how you can put those ingredients together and have it come out tasteless. Regrettably, I will have to pass on a return visit.",1
"Two stars because the service wasnt great. WIthin less than 5 minutes of looking at the menu, the server rushed us to put in our order. Some of the dim sum items were unavailable during dinner time which was disappointing. Ordered shrimp fried rice, har gow, sui mai, and kung pao chicken. Food was good but nothing to rave about. Ive had better dim sum at Mayflower in the Bay Area. The only thing I really liked about this place was how attentive the busboy was in refilling our drinks. Other than that, we saw our server twice to take our order and give us our check.",1
"I dined here a while ago for my girlfriends bachlorette party. The atmosphere of the restaraunt is really nice. Its located at the main level of the Mirage. Dining here makes you feel like your eating in a tropical rainforest, GREAT ambiance! Our server was on point, making sure we were well taken care of. We ordered from the pre fix menu for the appetizer i ordered the crispy shrimp with smoked pepper relish, and cilantro, the combination of this dish was amazing i wish they wouldve gave me more of this but it was only a small amount, what a tease! .For the entree i got the filet minon and crab gratin, i seriously cleaned my plate out on this one, and for desert i ordered the milk chocolate torte which was a perfect way to top things off. All this for 40 from their pre fixe menu. Good deal!",2
I love this place! Make sure Matt is your bartender such a great personality and he makes excellent recommendations! The pernil asado tacos are quite tasty. Try a side of the creamed corn too.you will not be disappointed!,2
"I have been a patron of this store since it opened and I do not know where to begin, so I'll start with this, stay away! As one other rater mentioned in another post, they keep changing managers. Because the place is so convenient I have tried to use it over the years and each time I do, i get disgusted and stop. Then they get a new manager and I try again, each time with the same result. The guys are either incompetent or unconcerned with customer satisfaction and safety. n nI have had multiple bad experiences, but the one that takes the cake is when they installed new tires on my vehicle and two of them went flat while driving on the 215 soon there after. The reason for the flat tires is they reused the old valve stems when installing the new tires. Are you kidding me, who does that and charged for new? Answer above. n nBe careful with these guys.",1
"I walked the length of 2 terminals to get to Bojangles. And after staring at the menu I ordered the 3 piece meal and the fries side. For 1 I added the ice tea. All's well so far. Then I take a bite of the chicken. It's steaming hot and the skin is crispy, but after the second or third bite I start to gulp the iced tea. The chicken is super salty. And I still had 2.5 pieces to get through.I'm not wasting it! To help make it more edible I grabbed done hot sauce and dunked the chicken in. n nAfter all the effort, I was full, but not satisfied. I think I should've just stuck to the open faced European style sandwiches at Beadeuvin in the Central Terminal. That's a classy, healthy spot in this airport. Someone needs to tell the chef that salt in NOT in fashion anymore! Can't believe this is the same place I gave 4 stars to in 2008!",1
"I've been going here for about 5 years, but I think it's finally time to make a change. I started going here because it used to be convenient, close to my office, but then my office location moved and now it's over 20 30 min to get here. They've always accepted my insurance and they have a good selection of glasses that I've been happy with over the years. The service is terrible though. The only reason I keep going here is because I genuinely enjoy my eye doctor, Dr. Charles Kesner. He's truly enjoyable, friendly, shares helpful information and suggestions for eye care, etc. That should truly be the most important part, but unfortunately I have just had a series of terrible experiences with the salespeople there that I've just gotten fed up and can't do it any longer. n nAs one of many examples I had to go around and around with them to get the right contacts the first time, a different brand than I wanted was ordered. I had an allergy to the contacts and had to return them. Then the wrong prescription came in, then I had to come back for another exam, then come back to pick up a new box, then come back for who knows what?! I don't live near Tempe all of this was majorly inconvienent, and when I was finally promised that the order was correct and in after several weeks of this, I was getting ready to leave on a long trip out of town I went to the office and they still weren't there. So I had to drive all the way up to north Scottsdale to their other office to get them, and when I went in after calling first and being assured they were there, the staff couldn't find the contacts i needed. Several irritated phone calls between stores and lots of gas money , the contacts were finally found. Not a happy customer though!",1
"This is the WORST dwelling I have ever set foot in! n nA complete bunch of idiots serving behind the bar. n nWe ordered the same drinks five separate times and each and every single time the price was different. So, I ask the one chick bartender, who thought she was on a fashion show runway, what's the price again? I tell her that everytime we've ordered it's been a different price, she shrugs her shoulders and fluffs up her hair, looks at me, shrugs her shoulders with even MORE emphasis and throws her arms up in the air.and fluffs her hair again! n nThen there was the other guy that held onto my debit card for about 15minutes. He had NOOOOOO idea what he was doing. He couldn't even give me a chilled shot of vodka, he had to ask the other guy to do it. n nThe first round of drinks seemed pretty normal for Scottsdale, but they just got more and more expensive. They must have looked around the place at how empty and slow it was.? Or, maybe they work off of commission on drink sales.? n nAnd, above all else, the atmosphere totally blew. Myself and four others did not have fun. We all left after being there a very short time!",1
"I don't know why it's taken me so long to write this review. I guess it's hard to have a good, well rounded picture of a place when you don't stray very far from your usual dish. I always order pho tai and add lots and lots of Thai basil and chile paste and oil. Mmhmm! Now I know I'm Mexican, and my go to hangover cure should be menudo, but. Man pho is just as good if not better. And I love that this place opens at 8am! Not that I'd ever be up that early with a hangover. But I'm a sucker for a warm bowl of steamy noodles anytime, and even more so when I feel like ass. n nThis particular bowl of pho is very consistent. The only thing I don't like about this place is that the service hasn't always been the best, and the place feels dirty on a regular basis. I do love that this place is a really inexpensive bowl of pho. In times when I am not at my richest I can grab a bowl of pho and be full the entire day. That's the best. The child really likes the bahn mi here as well so that is a bonus.",2
"Quick tip Way too far to walk from central strip. Make sure to take a cab. n nWe came sober mistake! and went for the 8.99 steak beer. Mehhhhh. I could barely stomach the steak, which had absolutely no flavor, but the mashed potatoes and gravy were pretty good. I probably would not come back unless I was lit.",1
"This store is AWESOME! I had a terrible experience at another specialty running store, so when I walked in here I was pretty frustrated and apprehensive, but I couldn't be happier with the level of service I received. They took the time to ask me all kinds of questions about my running style, watched me walk, then had me try several different shoes on the treadmill with the video monitor to show how my feet move. I found a fantastic pair of shoes at a really good price. I will definitely be going back here for all of my running shoes, and will highly recommend them to everyone.",2
"Pinkberry is the jam! I love that this is NOT a self serve place. I don't need a FREAKIN' bucket of fro yo. I want fresh toppings that haven't been tainted by small children's germ ridden fingers.

There is always something new to try! Sign up on their website to get a free small yogurt with toppings on your birthday.",2
"This was a terrible show. There wasn't much dancing, and what little there was, was unremarkable. A cheerleader competition has more synchronized dancing and better footwork than Jabbawockeez did. n nThe audience involvement portion was painstakingly slow and awkward. The ""story "", and I refer to the word ""Story "" lightly, to tie it all together was so loose it barely made sense. n nThe show was filled with 8 year old boy farting humor, which was appropriate for the 8 year old boys in the audience but I wasn't amused at all. n nSave yourself the money and go watch this group on You Tube. This is the worst Vegas show I've seen and I doubt it will last much longer.",1
"This dark moody bar has more character in a square inch than FIVE Scottsdale bars have altogether. Quite simply stated they just don't make bars like this anymore. Chez Nous oozes bar noir cool with the patterned neo gothic wallpaper, 70s light fixtures, plush leather booths, and a weathered old school sensibility. I don't know why I haven't reviewed this yet either having been several times. n nA small group of us bid farewell this past weekend to the 7th Ave Indian School charmer of a bar that was Chez Nous. n nI'm gonna go out on a limb here, but in my several trips here I've found this to be the most ethnically diverse crowd one can find at an Arizona bar all mingling, drinking stiff drinks and dancing to 70s funk and soul in harmony cue cheesy sappy music here . n nI hope the character of this bar and mix of regulars stays intact something I worry about since it's moving to the gentrifying Roosevelt arts district in August.",2
"How hard is it to make Mexican Food filled with flavor? Such simple ingredients shouldn't be so difficult rice, beans, tortilla shells.but you'd be surprised how bland these ingredients can be in the wrong hands. nI tried the Pittsburgh version of the California burrito and my friend had the fish tacos. Even though there were supposed to be other ingredients the only thing I tasted was the heavy portion of carne asada and fries.maybe a little cheese. No Guac, no salsa to be seen. I did like the crunch and flavor of the corn chips but the salsa needed about 1 2 bottle of Tapatio to give it some flavor and spice. The best part of the burrito was the grilled tortilla shell which gave the burrito some crunch. nMy friend's fish tacos were also lacking in the flavor department he decided to also dose it in Tapatio and then cut up the taco and mix it with the side of rice and beans. nSo no matter how late or drunk you are pass by go and do not stop at Los Cabos.",1
"My father, who had Alzheimer's disease and dementia, was a resident at Huger Mercy Living Center for the past six years. Our expectations for high quality care were exceeded in every respect. Some specific examples are given below. n n Beautiful, safe grounds with a large flower garden and unending walking paths sheltered patios for sitting outside in front of the four cottages n Well trained, competent, caregivers who receive ongoing professional training n Caregivers had extra patience and skills with residents when challenging situations arose n Staff who supported residents' faith, beliefs, and values n The care provided was based on the latest research about Alzheimer's disease and dementia for example, music as part of the activities and appropriate colors in the cottages n The meals and snacks were nutritious, varied and delicious n Variety of activities and outings to entertain the residents themed parties, refreshments after Chapel services n Communication with families was consistently excellent n Families and friends can visit ANYTIME and expect consistent high quality care n Speakers with expertise on topics that were relevant and of interest to families were provided n Monthly newsletter was sent to families with pictures of their Loved Ones n Staff managed the final days of life with respect and compassion n The staff worked well together as a team to care for the residents and their families n nWe cannot imagine better care than Huger Mercy Living Center provided. nWe recommend it to others without reservations.",2
Suuuuper friendly staff got me in and out with an oil change in under 30 minutes! I walked in without an appointment but they took me right in. Very helpful and affordable prices are just a perk! I absolutely recommend giving Hondatronics your business!,2
"This is the best nail salon I have found in Gilbert so far and believe me I've visited pretty much all of them in the last year since I moved here. Every other place I went, I came home pissy because the mani or pedi was not what I had hoped for. I am so pleased with the gel manicures here they do an excellent job. Also a nice, long foot massage with pedis. Also very clean. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because some of the staff seems grumpy like they don't want to be there.not all just some. Kelly is great.",2
"I've been here a couple of times it's not typical for me to go out of my way for frozen yogurt. nReally appreciate how clean the store is kept it looks brand new and spotless no matter the time of day and the toppings bar area is constantly cleaned and replenished always picture perfect. n nThere is a good variety of flavors available. 10, I think? And the staff is always friendly and quick to offer samples. n nOf course, as with most frozen yogurt places these days, you get to pile all the yuminess you want into the cup, and pay by weight when you're masterpiece is complete. That can add up REALLY fast! n nFresh, clean, friendly, and good selection of yogurt and toppings? I'll definitely be back!",2
"Not a great experience. My husband and I stopped in to Sprecher's for a sort of post Memorial Day back to work after a long weekend treat. The wait staff is friendly but I think we were very rushed. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms to start Chef ""Mic "" as in Microwave did not get all of them as hot as they should have been. I wondered in what freezer lane of Costco they were found. Also, our server forgot to bring the little plates not a huge glitch but I wondered what else would go not so right. n nWell, that was dinner. Decided on the spur of the moment to get comfort food meatloaf, mashed potatoes and ""creamed corn. "" The corn actually was whole kernel with some semblence of cream sauce, which was ok tasting but not hoopla. I am not sure what flavor was in the potatoes, that were under the two thinnish slices of meatloaf. I could tell by the ""stiffness "" on top of the slices that the meatloaf perhaps the entire plate had been sitting a long time and zapped for heat. yarny breaded onion whatever they were didn't do anything to cover that up. n nWe sat on the patio, which we normally like there, but were seated just under a speaker at the edge of the gazebo that covers the bar. I'm not ""old "" but can only take so much Z104 during dinner. n nOnce we were done, took forever to get our bill and a take home box for the leftovers. Would have been an OK instead of really not great experience if it hadn't been so expensive. Not such a treat. Has been better other times we've been there.",1
Eh. Blase menu and food execution. Excellent location and pretty nice interior but atmosphere is sterile. n nMany better options in Charlotte.,1
"Not a great airport. n nFirst, our flight got delayed from 8 30 to 9 50 so we figured we had a half hour to go grab some breakfast at one of the mediocre restaurants they have in the airport. We ate breakfast and then headed back to the gate at 9. When we arrived, they were already boarded and the door was closed. We asked what happened because our flight wasn't supposed to take off for another 50 minutes, and they told us they had bumped up the departure time. But they didn't announce it! There was no way we could have known that they bumped up the time. The TV flight monitors still showed the departure time as 9 50! n nSecond, the airport clubs they have are all a little dirty and tired looking. And the air conditioning wasn't working in our terminal. n nWouldn't necessarily recommend.",1
The people in the leasing office are extremely rude and wouldn't help me at all I was really looking forward to viewing the property and now I won't be back!,1
"Nespresso, you so yummy. n nPretentious or not, I dig it. This place is swanky, classy, and sophisticated. Yes, you are going to spend at least 5 6 on a coffee, but take in to consideration the variety, the ambiance, the area, the experience. and it could be worth it. If not, well, there are a bunch of great cheap coffee houses elsewhere, too. n nTheir food is quite good as well, having only tried their Salmon Tartare and Caesar Salad, I must say I have never been disappointed. Their tartare is served with a syringe full of balsamic and olive oil to eject over the salmon, which is a pretty interesting touch I have never experienced elsewhere. Their macaron's are good, and they offer a variety of other sweet goodies to sample and or order. n nThe place is very sleek and clean, and the servers are attentive and kind. If you happen to buy your espresso capsules from there, then they store your information in their system, making the process quite easy and convenient for future purchases they recycle the capsules too! Their espresso makers are top of the line, ranging in prices and styles according to your needs. For any fix ups or replacements on machines, they work hard and efficiently at taking care of your needs.",2
"I have been going to Threes since it was Press and have to say that I am a big fan. n nWhen it was Press my girlfriends and I discovered it during a walk around Uptown we'd just moved down from NYC so expectations where high for restaurants . It looked cute and we ladies love sushi so we decided to give it a whirl. I have to say that the sushi was some of the best we had tried in Charlotte and we LOVED that you could pick out your own wine. n nWe decided then and there that it would be our hidden gem. A real date place or girl's night out kind of spot we could take our visiting friends to. n nFive years have passed and we are still returning customers to what is now called Threes have to admit the name change threw us for a loop and we were devastated, standing on the street corner, thinking our beloved ""hidden gem "" had disappeared . n nThe menu has been updated and the inside has received a nice face lift not that the old look was bad but who doesn't love a good update every now and then right? . n nI'm still a die hard lover of their sushi and keep telling myself that I need to venture out of my comfort zone and try some things on the rest of the menu. n nWithout dragging this on I'm going to lay out the Pros in bullet form n n Sushi delicious and for those who like spicy I've heard their spicier sushi is delish n n The customer service has also gotten a face lift I know some people have said the service can be slow but that hasn't ever been a huge issue for me . This past weekend the waiter who served my friends and I remembered the wine we had last time! So yeah.we go a lot. n n The wine selection is great and I love being able to pick out my own bottle but someone is always there to help if need be n n Location solid spot just outside of Uptown. If you get a table outside the views are great and the people watching can be even better n n Sushi I know.I really need to venture outside of my comfort zone.next time. I promise . n nI can't give it five stars QUITE yet because as I've said I haven't tried everything on the menu. That's next up on my list so who knows.this review could also get a facelift ",2
"The only reason why I gave this salon 2 stars was because of the length of their foot massage. n n1. My manicurist cut me not once, but twice to the point my cuticles would not stop bleeding. n n2. My clear coat came off in ONE day.",1
"Pretty cool. the rooms have these insane projector screens. I did not like the fact that there was no casino in the lobby and they did not heat their outdoor pool. other than that, it was great.",2
"In a pinch, I had to find a place for lunch that was downtown, not overly expensive, and served both delicious soup and salad. A coworker suggested the Coronado Cafe, so I looked up the menu and happily discovered that it more than met my criteria. n nFor lunch, I had half of the Turkey sandwich and a small Coronado Gorgonzola salad. YUMMMM! The Turkey sandwich has a sort of cranberry relish instead of mayo much healthier and much more delicious , and the Gorgonzola salad had apple slices and candied walnuts. It was the exact meal I was in the mood for. n nThe restaurant itself is almost too cute for it's own good. It's small, cozy and the absolute polar opposite of any chain restaurant. The service was great, and my food arrived quickly. I can't wait to eat here again!",2
Slow service. I want my drink now. Guy behind won't cut down on his smoking but I guess I can't complain because it's Vegas. n n39 minutes later. Still no drink.,1
The desserts are out of this world and they have excellent customer service! I placed a large order after visiting in person. There was a shipping problem but Jean Philippe Patisserie responded immediately and rectified the problem. I highly recommend this place when you visit Las Vegas.,2
"We stopped into Kozy Cactus the other day for lunch. It's not one of our favorite places, but they have some interesting things on the menu, and they try hard to be ""local "" and organic. At least they used to. The menu we were handed had been cut in half and everything but bar food was gone. We asked the waitress what had happened, and she said that the management had changed but the name remained the same. Since we had our Restaurant.com coupon with us we decided to stay.not a great decision. n nWe ordered wings with sauce on the side, chili, onion rings and a patty melt. We waited and waited some more, and the place was not very busy. When our wings came they were slathered in sauce but we didn't want to send them back and risk waiting another half hour. Silly us, the sauce was awful! It seemed to be a mixture of marinara and bbq, to the detriment of each. Too bad because the wings themselves were decent. Ken said the chili recipe was totally changed it had no seasoning other than ""hot "". No onions or cheese were offered with it and our waitress was too busy chatting to come to our table for a request. The onion rings were dripping with grease, and like the hamburger, way too salty. n nThere are bars that serve way better food at much lower prices. I suggest you find one. And don't be fooled by the name. Like I said, it ain't Kozy anymore.",1

"For the price, you can't beat this Korean buffet place. it is like 13 for lunch and 17 for dinner. Most of the other Korean places are a bit too expensive Suri is 27 more variety and the Mother Korean is 25. My wife loves Korean so we try to do it once a month. If we went more often esp to a buffet , I probably ballon into the Michelin man. n nAs for the restaurant, outside, it doesn't look too appealing. In fact, it looks like a run down shack. The inside is like a diner setup. Kinda long and curves around the end. However, it was kinda cozy. n nAs for the service, the 4x's that we have been there, we thought the service was pretty good granted, all 4x's, we were with a large party . They filled your drinks and got you a scissor, forks, and napkins pretty often. Only issue that I had was that they only allow you one scissor per table. Kinda sucks when you have to cut alot of Gabbi and Korean Ribs. Otherwise, service was good. By the way, one of the things that I do like is that they regularly change your grille when it needs changing. n nAs for the food, dessert looks awful. Don't go there. There non meat dishes are nothing to talk about. However, you are at a Korean buffet so, eating meat and seafood is the key. Their meat selection and seafood are pretty good. Actually, I think it is comparable to other Korean restaurants in town. Each time, I usually focus on eating the shrimp and Korean BBQ ribs. Oooh la la. Granted, you don't get the selection of the other restaurants, but you do get your money's worth. Also, by the time that you are done eating, you do feel like a stuff pig. Oink! I guess this is one of the reasons why we come here often. n nCheers,",2
"I really enjoyed my experience here. It's romantic, has fabulous decor and friendly staff. The atmosphere was good not too loud or chaotic and we didn't feel pressured or rushed somehow we spent two and a half hours here . n nMy love and I had never tried Ethiopian food and our waiter was very good at explaining everything to us. We decided on the tasting menu. Our food was out within 25 minutes and I honestly expected a longer wait based on the description of the menu items. I was thrilled about the lack of utensils. Every single thing was tasty.everything. I especially enjoyed the lamb, so flavorful. The honey wine at the end was a special treat.",2
Fantastic food and great service at this 2nd location original on 7th st . The 5 lunch special for 2 slices and a soda can not be beat! Special thanks to Nancy and Eric for their friendly and superb service!,2
"Some days I just don't feel like driving far, but at the same time I don't want to cook. Sushi Tachi is one of those limited restaurants in Aliante that I will go to. I had been here once for their lunch special, so I decided to give it a try for dinner. The value for food is good, for 10.95 you get teriyaki chicken, shrimp vegetable tempura, california roll, miso soup, rice, cucumber salad, green salad. This isn't the best food, but probably the best in this area. I left extremely full and satisfied. This place was relatively packed on a Friday night, so I'm guessing it's the go to spot for a lot of AYCE fans up north. I would definitely return here for cheap meal, especially with the limited options in Aliante.",2
"I want to give a 2 stars because the service staff was friendly and good as well as ambience was decent. But we came here for food not to meet the staff. Food was just really mediocre, not even hot. The hashbrowns taste pre cut and frozen. The ""real maple syrup "" is just a maple syrup blend. I could make a lot better food myself. We had pancakes, bacon, and the wolf pack. All the prices were way too high with food that's more on par with denny's. Would rather IHOP across the street. Unfortunately it looks like another lackluster joint resides here before nypd pizza .",1
"Nikki is fabulous! She removed some eyelash extensions I had that were put on horribly by another salon and replaced them with high quality lashes. I paid 50 with tip for removal and new long, full lashes. I would highly recommend this service and the salon in general to everyone. Next time I am definitely going to try a facial and eyebrow threading!",2
Watched the show at Monte Carlo in December of 2013. Came here based on yelp reviews and that it was kid friendly. I've always wanted to see this show and was very excited.until I saw the show. I expected a lot more percussions and music. All I got was Blue Men awkwardly roaming around the audience and not much continuity or action throughout the show. My 8 year old nephew appeared really bored until the very end when stuff was actually happening. Never been so disappointed of a show in my life. I DO NOT recommend this to anyone. There are plenty of great shows in town and they're better than this show.,1
Came here for a really late dinner on Friday night. We were quickly seated and enjoyed the music from the in house DJ. n nI opted for the mini meatball sliders and since I was planning a long night of boozin. Our group tried the lobster Mac n cheese and the duck fat fries. Yum and yum. Next time I'll try an alcoholic shake! Also from our table we got to enjoy the Marquee madness huge lines so that was entertaining as well.,2
best damn tacos in las vegas hands down! n ngo here!,2
"AMAZING! This hotel went beyond all of our expectations! We arrived, late, nearly midnight I would say. We went to the registration desk to check in and found out our room was not ready because they thought we were a no show. To compensate they immediately gave us a 50 food and beverage credit. The lady checking us in then gave us a room with a view of the Bellagio water show which we thought was pretty cool. On our way up they called us back and told us they upgraded us to a balcony studio room suite on the 58th floor. This room was AMAZING and the view was even better than the first room! Saturday morning we came back from Vanity and ordered room service, we were able to get a huge pizza for only 26. That is awesome for room service, considering that the following night my friend ordered a 40 hamburger HA! Overall, we got a fantastic deal and paid about a third of what those rooms are going for now! n n There were two things that I disliked, one was the TV would not shut off and was blaring all night long. My friend did not want to bother engineering and ended up eventually unplugging it. n n And the other was there was always a long wait time when calling room service and concierge. n nOther than those two items the Cosmo is amazing!",2

"So sorry to have to the bearer of bad news but let me just say the new owners have Killed East Side Pizza. So sad, I am in mourning. We have been going to East Side for years, The previous owners Jerry and Peggy were awesome. Made you feel like you were going to Uncles pizza place and now its like the soul of the pizza and the place are gone. For a NY pizza Joint cirque de soleil decor does not work nor does it distract you enough to notice the food, the pizza, the environment and oh by the way the portion size is not the same anymore. The staff is loyal and doing their best but the new owners just don't get it and unfortunately just don't care.",1
The owner and food are hands down 5 star. You can't find better pizza and people. We love this place.,2
"This post office is a decent sized post office and always busy, which is very good on a business standpoint. I've never had any problems there and always have a good experience. Their people are really helpful and ready to answer any questions asked of them. I've seen customers treat the employees terribly and that is not cool at all. The postal workers are just doing their job and they work hard at what they do. n nThis is the friendliest post office I've been to since moving from Chandler three years ago. Their outdoor drive up boxes are perfectly located so you can get in and drop off your outgoing mail and be on your way.",2
"My neighbor took me here for my bday the other day.it was Tuesday evening and we had to wait 20 25 minutes I don't know the last time I've been to a restaurant and waited since I tried to avoid that, HOWEVER it was worth the wait. Because i loved the dessert so much, let's start with that! n nOf course, as it's been mentioned before, dessert is the cookie ooey gooey half baked cookie dough we chose the classic chocolate chip with 2 scoops of ice cream. Yummy yummy heavenly orgasm! I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious. I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home the things I would do to that cookie pizza ok, really I'd probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy, huh? n nthe CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same, don't know which one all were pleasant, nice, helpful. I really don't know that I've ever gotten better service. n nOn to the main attraction.we got the O'Riva Pizza large to take home leftovers and it was good not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had, but would i go back, definitley, would i order the same pizza, you bet. Would i try something else though, yep. n nGreat atmosphere, great employees, great food. n nOh, can't believe i almost forgot.the alcohol! My friend got the bellini VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin not the intent of the drink, just the effect . Would probably try a different drink the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste.",2
"I think there's a lot of hype around this place, so that might be the reason why I only though it was meh. I had the pizza and my friend had the pot pie and both were mediocre, nothing really special. For dessert we had the Frozen Hot Chocolate. It was something I had to try since it was their specialty but I probably would never get it again. It was good but too big, I had enough after a couple of sips.",1
"I'm going to break this review into positives and negatives. n nPositives n1. Great selection of many different types of Spanish and Portuguese food. n2. Fresh food that is well prepared n3. Interesting building with neat, cozy seating n4. Fast, efficient, polite serves n5. Lots of specials n6. Great paella, on par with what I have had in Europe. n nNegatives n1. A little dark n2. A bit pricy, but not so bad for the quality of food. n nOverall, this place has become our go to special occasion dinner place, especially because of the great variety.",2

"Although small less than an acre , Mitchell is the best dog park in the area. There is grass patchy in places, but grass nonetheless, and more than the picture shows surrounded by rock, and some concrete on a sidewalk that leads to seating. n nThere is plenty of street parking plus some off street parking next to the old school. The fencing is secure all around the park and the entrance is double gated. Benches line the park and four or five picnic tables are available. Shade is at a premium, however, so be prepared for the sun in the heat of summer. There is also lighting inside the park, but I haven't actually been there after dark. n nThe park regulars to a good job of making people feel welcome and policing the park. You'll see some poop, but not much, and neighborhood kids are quickly kicked out. Some kind soul brought a big bucket to use with the water tap on the side of the people and dog water fountain , and people work together to keep the bucket full and clean so that dogs can drink without waiting for a person to push the button. n nBig and small dogs aren't separated here, but I haven't seen any issues for this reason. People do a great job of keeping an eye on their dogs and making sure that squabbles don't turn into fights. n nClosed on Mondays.",2
Sweetie and I have passed by several times and have always wanted to stop in. It's really an appealing place from inside and out. We really wanted to love it but sadly we couldn't. The room itself is fabulous but the food and service just don't hold up. First it took forever to get attention and drinks. My general rule is to walk out if I'm ignored for 5 minutes and we went well past that .sweetie was hungry and didn't want to hunt another spot down on a Saturday night and intervened. The waiter seemed more interested in telling us about Eddie on the Food Network than he is in getting our order and was AWOL most of the evening. .Drinks took about 15 minutes to arrive .Eddie is more interested in being a celebrity than he is in making sure food gets out.and is properly seasoned. Appetizers took 30 minutes and the manager astutely comped them after we pointed out that we'd been waiting for 25 minutes for food. They would have gone back had they not been free as the grilled calamari was inedibly salty. I mean I like salt and this was headache salty. I had Chilean Sea Bass which was absolutely perfectly cooked but the menu said it was to be served with lemon candied broccolini and instead it was served with lemon zested broccoli. Yes Eddie there is a difference Sweetie's salmon was also perfectly cooked but the cloyingly sweet baclava it was served over was kind of off putting and really didn't match up. It also had some odd spice combinations that just didn't work. We skipped desert. nThere are too many better options in downtown Scottsdale so I don't think we'll be back.,1
"Not sure why my review was flagged but I can assure that I,m not an employee or another restaurant making trouble for a competitor, just an average consumer that lives on the Northside . n When will I ever learn. I really want to like this place. It's a cool building with neat old fashion feel to it. But the food is mediocre at best.The last time I was there I got what they called German goulash. I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good. n nSunday brunch nA neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for, yum. The sausage is great and the bacon is cooked in a range of doneness that everyone can find. So, for dinner and lunch my original 2 stars stand but the Sunday brunch is a solid 4 1 2 stars.",1
"ATMOSPHERE I couldn't imagine it being any better. Located in Vieux Montreal old Montreal just off the river, this establishment was featuring live jazz when we visited, and smooth jazz over the stereo when the band took breaks.

"I normally don't write bad reviews of businesses, but I have to write this one. I bought a Groupon for highlights and a cut. I was excited about getting my hair done. I made an appointment and went in for my cut and color. My stylist was really nice and really wanted me to be pleased. I have to say that the atmosphere of the place is like a night club. The music was SO LOUD that I could hardly hear my stylist. I told her that I wanted very subtle highlights in my dark hair. We looked over the swatches and found one that seemed to be the perfect fit. She started putting the foils in my hair, and that's when I started to get worried. It was taking her FOREVER to do the foils. I understand that she is a student and still learning, but I mean, she was taking forever. She used developer on my hair to lighten my hair. I told her that I was really not comfortable with using lightener because in the past I have just used color to do my highlights. She was taking so long to do my foils that she had to get another stylist to come and help her remove the foils from the left side of my head. I could see from the other stylist's face that she was mortified! My hair was white. It was seriously white. The rest of my head is black. I wanted to cry. She said that she had no idea that my hair would ""life "" so quickly. She promised me that she would use a toner on my hair and it would be much darker and the subtle highlights that I wanted. She took me back to the bowl to wash my hair and just left me back there with a wet head. I was back there for 30 minutes with my head in the bowl. I finally had to get up and track someone down to let me sit upright. My hair was soaking wet so I was afraid that if I set upright on my own without a towel, I would get color all over my clothing. She finally came back and put the toner on my hair. I could tell that she was nervous and thought that I would not like it. She was saying this as she was washing my hair. I was so scared. Now mind you, at this point it was almost 10 15 and my appointment was at 6 00. She did not have time to even cut my hair which I think was a blessing! The entire time I was there, not one teacher came by to check on my stylist not ONE time. Again, I realize that these are students, but I do think someone needs to be checking their work more often. My appointment was at night, so maybe someone who goes during the day might have a better experience. I called and complained and explained that I would like to have my hair fixed. I just wanted it back to the original color. I was told that someone would call me back. It took over a WEEK for someone to call me back. She then told me that I could come in for a conditioning treatment. Really? No. I went to another stylist and had my hair fixed. I would not suggest this school to anyone. I bought two Groupons at once and when I asked if I could just get product in place of a cut and color, I was told no. I am working with Groupon now to try to get my money back because there is no way that I am going back. I would say, proceed with caution!",1
"I love the Red Rock. Prior to the Red Rock Casino, the Green Valley Ranch GVR see http www.yelp.com biz 6kkxRV8H9SQLybj0xnEbMw in Henderson, NV was my favorite off the Strip destination. The Red Rock is modern and sophisticated. I believe the Red Rock is part of the Station Casino group and to me it's the Crown Jewel of all of their resorts and casinos. n nI had a chance to stay in two different rooms earlier in 2007, a Standard Room and a Suite. My Standard Room was comped and was very nice except for n1 I asked for a non smoking room and got smokers room. n2 I got a Handicapped shower stall instead of a Bathtub. n3 The Flatscreen TV in the bathroom was not working. nI ended up waiting for over a half an hour on the phone with different people at the front desk being put on hold or transferred then dropped, when I finally got in touch with the hotel manager. She promptly upgraded us to a Suite for the next couple of days. n nIn anycase, I'm amazed and impressed at the level of detail they put into their rooms. The rooms are so luxurious you aren't compelled to leave. n nNote This is a historical review and while the details are fuzzy this Resort made a great first impression. Now, I'm spending another week in Vegas for a Wedding Reception at the Santa Fe Station see and a work related convention at the Mandalay Bay, while staying at THEhotel see . n nIf you're looking for an off off the strip location, Red Rock Casino should be first on your list!",2
"Okay we went in a group of eight at noon, so the place is packed with people and busy, we expected that. took us about 10 min to place order which was fine rush hour. I Ordered white widow, blunt with guacamole sauce came to about 11 nThe fun part started, waiting for our sub, after about 15 min first sub delivered to one of the guys in the group, another 5 min and everyone in the group got their sub but me so I decided to play it cool and be nice and give them some more time. nAbout half a dozen of people got their subs and I still didn't get mine I asked for my sub and mentioned that I've been waiting for a while, the answer was oh what's your name oh ok yours is coming out in a second, a minute passed and didn't see my sandwich at this time i started getting upset asked again for my sandwich but no one seemed to have a clue about it and the person who seemed in charge looked for my order and said oh yea its coming, 5 min passed and another half a dozen of people went by and I still didn't get my sub. By now about 30 min have passed and more and more people got their food and I'm standing their watching. Went back to the staff and asked for my money back. nI don't care how good the food looked like or how many people say its taste good, with this rudeness and carelessness this store is worthless. Btw One of the guys in my group got the wrong sandwich. nI might give this store another try if they tried to make it up to me. Would I do it again with a group or a recommend to friend. No. Don't embarrass yourself and go their. n I'll let you know if they proven me wrong and contact me through Yulp and show that they do care. nI will keep you guys posted",1
"As much as I love barbeque, I haven't been happy with any one place in town. Some have great meat, some have great sauce, but none had both. until now. n nHubby and I went with a friend to try this place out and left with full tummies and happy faces. n nFirst, ambiance. it's a tiny place inside an industrial strip mall next to an overpass. the word ""dive "" was invented for this place, I believe. Trust me, you won't care. The new tables inside are nice, though. n nService. great! n nNow for the best part. the food. The sides were average to good, but we didn't try a lot of them. Cole slaw was ""interesting "", mac n cheese was ""okay "", baked beans were ""good! "" . but we forgot those as soon as we bit into our meats. n nI had the pulled pork sandwich, the ""Piggy "", which came with a side and a drink. The sandwich was enormous. first thing I did was cut it in half for taking home half of it. Then I bit into it and all my taste buds jumped up and did a cheer. It was the most incredible pulled pork I've ever had. Superlatives abound. juicy, tender, meaty, saucy, omg nom nom nom. I'll be honest. that other half never stood a chance of going home, I ate it all. n nHubby couldn't decide so he got a half rack each of the baby back pork ribs and the beef ribs. He was exclaiming about how incredible the pork ribs were and then he tried the beef, completely forgot the pork was there. He's definitely a beef ribs guy, always prefers those, and found a level of beef rib heaven he hadn't known existed. And the size of those beef ribs? Definitely brontosaurus sized, massive amount of meat on each rib. n nOur friend got ""The Biggin "" sandwich and the brisket sandwich. He devoured the Biggin and was making lots of strange noises, occasionally coming up for air to proclaim the food amazing. The brisket arrived a bit later, and brought out a new level of attention he said it was as tender as a pulled pork sandwich and we all were amazed that there was moist and tender brisket, because every other bbq joint manages to dry the meat out. Since he has two hollow legs, he ate every bite of both of those monster sandwiches. n nThe prices are cheap, the food is amazing, and it's probably good that they're not located closer to home D. I'm willing to bet that the Pitmaster there gets marriage proposals on a daily basis, because of his great food. Hubby was ready to ask for a divorce so he could marry him, and I would have understood. ",2
Love the different flavor crusts and they had my food delivered in under twenty minutes. Howie bread is the BEST!,2
"Get your inner hippy out for a trip to Red Oak. This place is a diamond in the rough in the midst of a college campus. It's surrounded by fast food think McDonalds, burrito joints, wings and is a breath of healthy fresh air amidst the trans fat factories. n nThey have a lot of neat options ranging from vegan wraps to grilled cheese sandwiches to tasty salads with lots of healthy and fresh vegetable combinations. I tried one of their smoothies for the first time it was beet based and while I'm not one to typically order a shake made with raw beets I rolled the dice and I believe I left a healthier person. I felt like I earned my Birkenstock sandals. n nRed Oak is busy at lunchtime, and when school is in you're going to stand in line and then play musical chairs to get a seat. The middle of the restaurant hosts a large community style table and the opposite wall is lined with a counter and benches. There are several four top tables that are very tightly lining the other wall. This is not my favorite place to sit for lunch but definitely one of my favorite places to EAT lunch.",2
"This place is pretty freakin' adorable and pretty damn good, too. I wandered in around 6 00 one night and grabbed a table. It's a cute little place with not many tables probably about 10 inside, and 10 or so outside as well . I started with the filet mignon meatballs and was very happy that I did. Three large meatballs, tender and juicy, covered with a yummy marinara sauce. Very good, and well worth the cost in my opinion. I ended up ordering the gnocchi, and the host other waiter heard my order as he walked by and actually exclaimed, ""Oh! The Gnocchi! Yes! "" I thought it was pretty funny. He was right, too, though. It was a large bowl filled with gnocchi and a basil pesto sauce that tasted as good or even a little better than it looked. n nThe rolls were good, and the price was very reasonable for everything as well. I felt like I was at a real Italian eatery, which was pretty fun too.",2
Awesome food. Nice people. Recommended.,2
"Best meditranian restaurant in whole entire las vegas. great customer service, loved it",2
"My love suprised me by taking me here for our night after Valentines night together. I had wanted to see this for so long and super excited to see it. I have to say with all the hype there was alot to be desired. The slapstick comedy was great and entertaining but as far as everything else it was a stretch. Weird and awkward at times. I guess I've seen alot of Cirque shows and it was really ""just another Cirque show "". n nPlease dont get me wrong there was alot of talent here. The little guy doing the acrobatic part was one of our favorite parts. The 2 guy tease back and forth you could have taken out.pretty tacky and who really does that no matter who you are? Like in other posts the audience interaction was funny but a little too much of that. n nWe ran into some friends while we were there and their thought of the show was just as ours was ""EH "". It was weird and entertaining to say the least. Good to at least say I've seen it.",1
"I have been a member of 24 fitness for a year because I spend half my time in California as well as Las Vegas. I figure I can use the gym wherever I am since its a nationwide gym. n nmy primary membership is with Las Vegas Athletic Club. I have been a member since 1994. n nIn comparison, I think the tier membership for 24 hour fitness is totally ridiculous. I went to the 24 fitness on Rainbow Alta just to check it out and I am told that this particular gym is a Super Sport and that my membership doesn't allow me to go there. To be fair, they allowed me to work out since I was already there, but it didn't say that anywhere on the outside of the building. Jeez, you would think that it was a David Barton gym or a Lifetime fitness. Nothing special. I dont even think it was a big deal when it was Q sports, but whatever. n nI do go to a gym in California.It suits my needs, but you even have to have an fm radio to listen to the tele. They definitely do not spend much on upgrades. n nin any event, I probably will not renew my membership once it expires in a year. Maybe nI have just been spoiled by LVAC. I have never had any complaints about this great, local gym.",1
Best Margaritas ever and our favorite place for happy hour!,2
"This place makes some really good food. If you're looking for a place to get your grub on after cuttin up a rug at the clubs, this is the place to be. Try the philly cheese steak or better yet, go for the chorizo and eggs breakfast platter. That was awesome!",2
"Best Chinese in town. Quick delivery, great service, great price.",2
Excellent service. Very helpful with recommendations. We got red hummus and chicken shish kabobs. Dinner portions were more than enpugh. We took some home for the next day. We would definitely come here again.,2
Wow! I had tried their beer at Tap Bottle and wanted to check out their brewery on a recent trip to Phoenix and surrounding areas. We LOVED it. Their menu is varied and unique and good! From their beer braised bleu burger to french cut wings and green chile pork sliders we tried them all and left barely able to move. And the beer! We started with the Refuge IPA and hardly were able to stray from that. I believe we sampled a RyePA too but the Refuge was our favorite. We enjoyed ourselves so much on our first day that a couple days later we made the detour again so we could stop back in on our way home. This time we filled our stomachs and a growler to go and threw in a couple shirts. Can't wait to be back.,2
"Went there for thursday lunch with a friend. Atmosphere is great. Ordered tomato bisque, kobe burger wit sweet potato fries, and pasta the vegetarian one . Tomato bisque was a bit salty to our taste, but extremely rich and delicious. Kobe burger was SO juice and magnificent, don't know how else to describe it. Pasta was tasty too. Overall, great choice for special occasions!",2
"Great food, great service, reasonable prices and atmosphere was conducive to comfortable dining. Had breakfast lunch and supper.",2

"I was given a groupon so I went. I went there with no appointment I called ahead , and was the only one there. The lady that did my mani pedi was very nice but I don't think she's a licensed manicurist. I could tell she lacked experience. My cuticles weren't done, I was there almost 2 hours, I didn't even get my nails poished, I was just ready to leave. Worst mani pedi I've ever experienced, unfortunately.",1
"Yay for gelato! Cafe Gelato is a great haven from that wretched Vegas heat. The place sure is fancy as expected for something at the Bellagio with their mini jam jars and super thick napkins. The gelato thankfully wasn't TOO expensive though. n nThe Oreo flavor was super good, more so than the Mint flavor, which I normally favor. Nonetheless both were extremely satisfying after walking around the strip in humid weather.",2
I don't think you press some white processed substance into a 9 iron shape and call it shrimp. Can someone send this to a lab or something? I need to know what I ate!,1
I'm hesitant to say this after only one visit but this might be the best breakfast I've ever ate in Phoenix. I was a little apprehensive about ordering coconut curry waffles but took the server's recommendation. Holy sh they were awesome. They had just the right amount of coconut flavor with just a hint of curry. I also had the biscuits and gravy which was equally impressive. Heck even the coffee was good. The only criticism I would have is for the price I think they could increase the portion size on the waffles. Well.I do have one more complaint and that is that I discovered this gem only 10 days before I move out of state!,2
"I had a business trip in Waterloo and my options were to fly into Toronto or this gem of an airport. I'm glad I flew into Waterloo instead. n nAmerican Airlines now runs a twice daily flight from Chicago ORD to YKF. It's on a small regional jet, but when you land you quickly realize that the regional jet is the largest plane that serves the airport. The Bearskin planes are propeller planes that serve other areas of Canada. n nArriving is a breeze you only need to compete with around 20 or so people to get through immigration. The officers were all very relaxed as they only need to work when this Chicago flight comes through. There's a few taxis waiting outside to whisk you off to your destination. n nDeparting is also a breeze no need to take off shoes or belts when going through their security check. Again, you're only competing with 20 or so people to get through security. I had a 6AM 'international' flight to Chicago and only had to arrive at 5am. You could never arrive that late if you were to fly out of a large airport. n nThere's also free WiFi in the airport!",2
"I gotta give it to Tropicana, they are not going down without a fight. First they tried Nikki Beach, RPM, and now Bagatelle. I don't really know what they're trying do to but I feel this place is masquerading around like a wannabe South Beach trendy lounge club, but they just can't get there. I usually park in the 2 story parking garage on the south side of the Trop, when I pulled in, they had it shut down it's been awhile since I've been at the Trop, who knows what they're up to with that , so I drove around to the north end facing MGM and I noticed Bagatelle had it's own entrance and parking lot I guess they have valet, but there was no attendant and no indication if it was closed or what , I ended up parking in a very confusing lot in front, there was only one entrance but as soon as you entered, there were arrows going the opposite direction. n nAnyways, I didn't know anything about this place, my friend invited me on a Thursday night, apparently they have ladies night on Thursdays that includes a pre fix meal and one drink, now I'm not sure of the specifics because the company she had invited me under was comping this, again I don't know the details, I just showed up . When we arrived we were greeted by two host hostesses who walked us down to the restaurant lounge bar area. This was a little bizarre. We went straight to the bar, drinks are 14 each and I had the nastiest drink I could have picked. A large group of loud, obnoxious drunk people came behind up and took over the bar, all of them ordering shot after shot, I noticed they all had nametags on, apparently this is a stop along a bar crawl per the bartender. So instead of paying any attention to the two people not with this crowd who I'm sure weren't tipping, they were drinking for free , so I ended up with one drink because she was more involved in paying attention to the guys. Drink menu wasn't impressive anyways. n nOnto the food. We were seated at a table, and the DJ starts playing. If anyone had been to First Food and Bar, you can understand how loud and horrible trying to have a conversation with the person sitting next to you, and you can't because you will have laryngitis tomorrow from screaming. It was basically club level volume. I gave up on trying to talk. We had the Salad Bagatelle which was basically a head of butter lettuce and salad dressing, Grilled Salmon, Grilled Skirt Steak, Mushrooms and Pommes Puree. Only notable item was the Pommes Puree. Oh and Creme Brulee for dessert. n nI don't ever see myself returning, for anything. I don't care if it was free.",1
"After being a little day drunk from a Marquee pool party, we went walking around looking for a yummy place to eat. Eventually, my friend and I stumbled on this amazing pizza spot next to Jose Andres' restaurant, which incidentally had actually been recommended to us by another friend though we didn't realize it until later. The pizza was on hit piping hot, with just enough grease from meaty pepperoni to satisfy my buzzed cravings. Once we sobered up a little, we realized that the Cosmo was gorgeous and had a ton of fine dining to check out, making us realize we want to stay here the next time we are in town. Though we were happy with the Venetian, the Cosmo is sleek and has a great young and modern ambiance that fits in perfectly with those wanting a little sophistication during a weekend of debauchery.",2
If you haven't tried Pure Pizza out you should give it a try soon. Not sure exactly what they do or how they do it but they really have something special in their pizza crust and focaccia bread. Maybe there are gluten fairies working in secret or something not sure but all I know is it's darn good. n nI have had their pizza multiple times and you can't go wrong there. Try the smoked salmon pizza for something a little different. Today I ventured down and had their caprese focaccia sandwich and it was nothing short of amazing. Just simple and delicious. n nNot really sure what else I can say. Gave them four stars but probably like 4.5.,2
"The service is always friendly however I was overcharged and she didn't realize it. I pointed it out and she still thought it was right. She tried to explain that it was tax, which it wasn't because the base price was 4.55 instead of 4.15. She asked me to speak to her manager so she could explain it to me. The manager acknowledged it was wrong but said that they don't set the prices so they can't help. Wow!",1
"Great outdoors store that has just about everything.I have never bought anything here, but has been a great place to take people to sight see. I have even taken children here to check out the huge fish tanks, stuffed animals real ones and all the unique gear that goes along being a hunter, fisher, or outdoors type. n nI am sure the prices are not the best, but you go here for the huge selection of unique tools and equipment that is special to these recreational hobbies. nAnyways if I was an outdoors type, hunted, or fished, or just curious on taking up a new hobby this is a place to check out.",2
This was the second time I've been Le Grand Comptoir the first being 2 years ago and the food and service was as good as I remember it. n nThis night I started with the escargot with artichokes with a cream sauce which were ok. I was actually expecting the escargot to still be in the shell which they were not so I couldn't help but think that they came from a can. They did have a good flavor and were not rubbery so I was still happy. n nThe meal was accompanied by the soup du jour which was potato and leek which was really tasty. n nI accompanied this with the house white as per recommended by the friendly waiter and it was a great combination. n nFor my main course I had the sirloin steak medium rare in a beajolaix sp? sauce which came with fries and a sald. The steak was cooked perfectly and the fries were excellent. n nI had the house red as per recommended and again it went perfectly. n nThe servers were extremely attentive and awesome. n nDefinitely try it!,2
"Brown rice is MUSH! Today was the second time I've been since my office moved a block away. I gave it another chance because there is no way a place like this would over cook their rice to the point where it practically melted together.think again. I have been to Samurai Sams a million times over the years for the ""healthy alternative "" to fast food and either something has changed to the quality of food or I've been there too many times that I'm burned out. The rice issue is huge.who wants mushy rice? Like someone said in reviews below everything is now premade just sitting there. Not sure how true that is but thats what it seems. Big bummer. ",1
I've gone by this place many times on my way to the Culvers next door and decided to finally try it out. The chicken kabobs looked good on the menu but they were really dry like they were cooked and reheated. The vegetables and rice were okay but I've had better. The person I was with had the gyro with fries. They said gyro was good but the fries were awful which I agree. The fries had no flavor and looked like they were fried twice. I will avoid going to this restaurant in the future.,1
Have been calling to schedule an appointment also had some questions n ofcourse no answer,1
"Would have been five stars for us if they hadn't lost our reservations. Rude never works . To the restaurants credit they were able to accommodate our group of eleven. nThis was the best dinner we had in Vegas and I want to go back. Fresh oysters, fish and chips and my favorite Hangar 1 vodka. nThanks to manager to help us feel welcome nThat's points!",2
"Casa Rugantino was great I was really please with our dining experience. n nWe had a large group of 11, and they were a able to accommodate us we called a week before and b accommodated us well in their small space. Nice work, guys. n nWe had a range of vegetarians to meat eaters, so we ordered bruschetta, an apperitivio, cappellini, carabonara, spaghetti and meatballs, steak tenderloin, and some things in between. Their wine selection was also great. n nThey sold us on dessert I definitely recommend the tartuffa, raspberry is best. The lemon sorbet looked amazing, but alas. I guess next time. n nThe good solid experience. nThe bad the bread was ok, kind of meh. n nProtip the oil vinegar bottle on the table is, in fact, for use. It's pretty, for sure, but use it, fool! Gotta douse that bread in tastiness.",2
"Organ Stop Pizza is truly a family oriented establishment. Long, large tables end to end everywhere, and 2 stories to boot. The pizza was better than expected traditional, not greasy, plenty of toppings built out so that there isn't even a bone. Our group which had ages 1 60 , didn't have a single complaint and we had over 10 pies served of varying types. n nAbove all else, the music is great. I've never experienced anything like this, and if you enjoy good wholesome family fun, I highly recommend Organ Stop Pizza.",2
"This rating is based on the ""new "" menu alone. They have slashed the number of appetizers, burgers and other options. No more nachos, chili con queso, chili chili cheeseburger or garlic fries amongst others. Used to love the variety, now it is too limited. n The service during this visit was great.",1
"Having stayed at the Tropicana on our honeymoon 5 years ago, I have a bit of a soft spot for the joint. n nThe newly renovated rooms are great. We stayed in a room in the Paradise tower at the front above the casino and we had a great view across to NY NY and a little bit further down the strip. n nThe bed was comfy and the bathroom was nice. The wi fi was pretty quick. n nNo fridge in the room which sucked. we did request one but i wasn't going to pay an extra 10 bucks a night for one. It was nothing a couple of daily trips to the ice machine couldn't fix. n nThe pool area was great. no complaints. n nThe Casino itself wasn't bad. Can be a bit hard to got on a blackjack table during the evening but other than that it was good. Cocktail waitresses did go missing at times but when you finally got one to come past, a nice first up tip 5 helps to keep them close by.",2
"Let me start off by saying we had a great server Nicole. She was fantastic and so much fun! nThe appetizer ahi won ton tacos I think were amazing! So many different flavors. Loved them! nHusband had Motley Q, he was in heaven. Loved every bit of it. I cant say enough about the fries.just the thought I want to go back now! Homemade ketchup was great, not sweet like store brands. I dont remember name of what I had but was so good. It had an au jus with it. There was so much food we could have eaten ourselves into a coma. Everything with food was perfect! We were so full we could not eat any dessert. Though they all looked like the bomb.com! nDrinks from the bar I have to say were not so good. They were thrown together and probably worst we've had. There were no garnishments on any 5 drinks. Bloody Mary was literally tomatoe juice vodka. Was so boring that my husband gave bartender a recipe to make for him. Was much better but still no garnishment. No olives, no celery, nothing. We did talk to general manager about it and he did take care of the issue. Assistant manager came by we made suggestions on the drinks. He did say every drink is to come with garnishment. Both managers were awesome and had great attitudes and asked us personal questions about our visit to Las Vegas. They seemed very sincere. n nWe definitely will go again when in Vegas! We so LOVE LOVE this restaurant! n nWish I could give 5 stars but because of the drinks I had to give 4 stars. n nThank you Guy for opening this great restaurant! n nThank you Managers Nichole for giving us such a wonderful experience! n np.s. we also went to Gordon Ramseys in Paris and between the two, Guy's restaurant was by far the best!",2
"I'm pissed! We went to Firehouse today and the food and service was find but I came out and my truck was towed because I parked in the only available spot next to Jack in the Box. nI went back into Firehouse and I asked ""Do people get towed "" They answered ""oh yes all the time "" nThen I asked, ""Why don't you tell your customers to help them avoid getting towed? "" They said ""well there are signs everywhere. "" nDo you really think anyone would risk eating their again after getting towed and they don't even extend the courtesy of warning you about the parking. nStupid irresponsible business practices. Obviously they don't care about their customers.",1
"Club like atmosphere, surprise, it's Vegas. Food was tasty, but the service was a joke. Ordered beers, but first three names I prattled off were not available. What kind of crazy exotic beers did I order that they were out of? Michelob Ultra, Guinness, and Tsing Tao. Finally I just asked what DO you have and got a Sopporo. Ordered 5 items and our waitress forgot 2. All tables had their food when we ordered. And the next batch of customers did not arrive until we were finished ordering. How can you forget a 5 item order? But I digress. The check was 50 for 3 ppl, although we only had 2 peoples worth of food. Still not bad for Vegas. Would be a 3.5 star rating if judged only on the food.",1
"Stingray used to be my favorite place to go for sushi but after numerous poor experiences during the past year or so, I don't intend to go back, at least to this location. It is difficult to believe that the restaurant is owned by the same people that own Geisha. The sushi at Geisha is equally as good, but the service is much much better. At Geisha they are super friendly and welcoming, and check on you to make sure you don't need anything, and like the food. At Stingray they are rude, very unwelcoming, and not helpful at all. I personally don't enjoy going to eat where the waitresses are completely bitchy, which has frequently been the case at Stingray. There is no excuse for this. Cute atmosphere and good sushi do not make up for the mistreatment of their patrons. I was very loyal to Stingray for years, always recommending it to others, but everyone I've taken there lately has had negative experiences with the service from rude waitresses to empty glasses to messing up the orders. If you want good sushi just go to Geisha which is across the street from Stingray. It is open til midnight just like Stingray and the staff has been properly trained there, a very nice touch ",1
"Went here for my birthday with a group of friends. The food was good, however the service was probably the WORST I've ever experienced. I had made a reservation in advance, so they were perfectly aware of the large party. Not to mention, there was ONLY one other table in the entire restaurant eating. n nWe saw our server maybe once, possibly twice when she asked for our drinks and then brought us our check. We all had empty drinks for probably 20 30 minutes. I was disappointed because I had brought so many close friends and family here, in hopes of having a fun dinner. n nI truly am never one to complain and always give the benefit of the doubt I use to serve but this was awful. Not to mention extremely overpriced. n nOverall all, don't go here!",1
"My sister and I visited Rusconi's last night because of all the great yelp reviews. Upon our arrival I was a little taken back that a great restaurant could be planted right in the middle of a Panda Express and Corleones. After I walked through the door I ditched my first impression. nThe restaurant was very busy but they quickly got us a table. We were promptly and cheerfully greeted by our server Tommy. He was a lot of fun and gave us some great suggestions that we took him up on. nWe shared the Kitchen Burger and the Osso Bucco. Neither disappointed. The Kitchen Burger had a great fresh taste. We ordered it with the fries and the lemon aioli that it came with was amazing. The Osso Bucco was to die for and it was paired nicely with asparagus, whipped mashed potatoes and this delicious prickly pair cabbage. Tommy checked on us several times throughout the meal and was extremely friendly each time. nUnfortunately, we were too full to try dessert but I plan on coming back for that because everything sounded amazing!",2
"We came to Circo expecting to be blown away, but sadly we were not. The restaurant is nice, the staff is attentive, and it provides an awesome view of the Bellagio fountain, but the food is not worth what you pay. n nWe started with their soup beans and veggies can't remember the name . It was nothing special. n nTheir buffalo mozzarella appetizer really just a caprese was alright. The tomatoes and the peppers made the dish. Again nothing special, but quite good when eaten with their house breads. n nMy husband went with the lamb dish, which he really liked. I thought it was tasty, but I didn't much feel like lamb, so I didn't take more than a bite. n nI went with their scallops. The scallops were cooked well, but I did not think that they had much flavor. The white bean puree tasted like plain refried beans. Nothing there aside from the taste of beans. n nTry your luck at another Italian establishment.",1
"I love that they are 24 hours and budget friendly. Especially after a long vegas night, you want something warm and wholesome to make you feel better and get right back in the action! n nThey also have a full blown bake shop, to satisfy anyone's sweet tooth. Great variety of gourmet muffins, cookies jumbo sized or cookie bites , brownies or for the healthier option fruit parfaits. n nHere's what we ordered n You can add a side of soup which is my favorite , or you can add chips, potato salad, pasta salad, coleslaw, for a small additional price. n nCaprese this sandwich is super simple yet crazy packed with flavor and freshness! It's your classic caprese on a toasted sandwich. They really loaded the sandwich with a fair amount of thick juicy slices of mozzarella and basil. They also topped it with a scrumptious dreamy balsamic glaze. It was definitely love at first bite. This sandwich also went very well with the creamy tomato soup. 5 5 n nThe Original 1762 This is the bare basic. It's moist roasted beef, melted cheddar, and some horseradish sauce. It was simple, but the roast beef was cooked well and super moist and flavorful. Not too much cheddar and not too much horseradish sauce flavor. It was easy to eat, especially if you knocked one too many down and need some help sobering up. 4 5 n nCreamy tomato soup it's definitely creamy, thick and very comforting. It has a great tomato cream flavor and I especially loved the freshly fried super crispy croutons. They were so good! I should of asked for extra! This soup is definitely one of my favorites and they always pair well with most of the sandwiches. 5 5 n nHawaiian bbq ehhh I didn't like this sandwich. It had a big piece of chicken breast with bbq sauce and also 2 slices of canned pineapple rings, well they advertise fresh pineapple, but it tasted canned to us. Also the way it's cut into rings on the sandwich made it messy and the insides moved around and made it awkward when I bit the sandwich. The flavor was off too. It just tasted like canned pineapple and nothing special. Great concept, but poorly executed and not so tasty flavor. I would not recommend this one. 1 5 n nBrownie 2.29 A classic brownie that was moist, fluffy and tasted good. I took two bites but saved the rest for later. It's pretty big! 5 5",2
Place is awesome good food good drinks good music on a Wed. night great place to chill and get twisted before pink rino lol,2
This place has great food and atmosphere. The sevice isnt that great but the food makes up for it,2
"I usually go somewhere else for my eyebrows but it was closed at the time so I went here to Diva Beauty with my sister and got the yelp deal for 2 off. We walked in and were kind of greeted by the receptionist. She seemed a little bored and wasn't smiling or being very welcoming, which was kind of sad. The lady that threaded my brows was nice but the threading was painful. I've gotten my eyebrows threaded dozens and dozens of times and this was the most painful it's been for me. In the end, my eyebrows ended up looking nice so I guess the pain was worth it. When we went to pay with our yelp deal, the girl at the counter kind of gave a little bit of attitude, but whatever. I'm probably only come back here when my other eyebrows place is closed for the day again.",1
"I kept seeing this shop and finally stopped by. Very happy I did! The shop is new but laid out well and kept very clean. I was greeted as soon as I walked in which was great as I had a ton of questions. Both people running the store took time to help me, answering questions and just being very cool. I was there to get a gift for my lady and it was obvious they wanted to help make it good. They went over my options without trying to push me right to the most expensive models. After talking we actually found a very reasonable model that was perfect. Looking at juices without nicotine I couldn't believe all the flavors they had. I like how they have their own as well as other companies. My girl loved the gift and I loved the experience, highly recommend the shop and their wonderful staff.",2
Trip three thry burned the carne asada tacos. Andbthey triedbto tell me they make it charred. I know I like it charred. but who likes burned food. now I expect to get it rare,1

"Pooja transforms! I tend to not take care of myself, putting everyone else first.She literally made me feel like I was on the red carpet.I looked like a celeb. She is passionate about what she does and puts her heart and soul into her work. I have recommended her over and over. Everyone walks away in complete awe. She is amazing!",2
"Great tamales, fast food prices",2
"a good place to have a couple of beers,but basically is just another HRC,nothing special about it.",1
"We ate lunch there on 4 7 The place has no ambiance. It does have slow service, and high prices, The food was bland and tasteless. and small portions. Over all it is Yuk. 7 of us all had different dishes and none of us were impressed.",1
"Had to see what everyone was raving about, so the wife and I went there on September 3rd, 2013. Overall it looked on the inside as it appears on the outside rustic. Cafe was seat yourself, so we picked a table and prepared to be amazed. We both ordered the fried chicken dinner. It could have been a bad day, but our chicken could've been mistaken for a parakeet! At almost 13 bucks each, we expected a decent sized portion, somewhat akin to the size of the chicken at Golden Corral. These looked like they walked to the cafe and died of exhaustion. They were cooked so crunchy that they almost completely disintegrated with every bite. OK, but the place is known for pies, lets try a baked good. Took home two cinnamon rolls at 2.50 each. I've had better, a lot better, at Cinnabon. Sorry we stopped and won't be back.",1
So disappointed in the fact that their prices went up AND they took their chips away from the meals ! 9 dollars for a turkey wrap plus no more chips ! Two thumbs down.,1
"Thank you to Patrick D. and Clint B. for helping me find this place. Due to poopy weather our planned M Pool day was cancelled. The kids were really bummed and I had to come up with something off the top of my head to make them smile.Run Plus Fun came to mind. n nI quickly browsed their website and found out that its pretty reasonable 8.00 per kid , has long open play hours 9 00am to 6 00pm.I think , socks are required and clothes with buttons on the butt aka jeans are not allowed because they damage the slides.so off we went. n nWe pull up and the lady up front was helpful and quickly showed me the bathroom the kids had a lot of caprisun in the car . Then for about 2 1 2 hours the kids went insane. It was so fun to watch the look of joy on their faces. It was nice for me too because when I wanted a break from playing with them I could chill on the couch and still have my eye on them. n nI noticed that there was a lady cleaning a lot.and I can't blame her. Some parents don't know how to clean up after their kids super annoying . There were snack wrappers and popcorn kernels left by one such parent and her children. They don't get in the way. As for the mean workers yelling at the kids.I saw no such thing. Corrine was wonderful with my buggers and when they broke the rules she gently reminded them. n nOverall I will definitely be back.but next time I will bring coffee.",2
"Decidedly confused pub. Trying to sell overpriced ""English "" tap brew in a frathouse atmosphere.",1
"MY NEW ABSOLUTE FAVORITE CHICKEN WINGS. In all certainty. n nSlightly crispy, piping hot, yet with a spicy sour sweet sticky sauce over the top that is absolutely great. n nAlso tried the chicken sandwich and BBQ bacon burger everything was delicious. n nFavorite late night food spot in Vegas fo shoooo!",2
"1. Air quality in building is poor. n nWhen traveling on a budget, I will never skimp on sleeping accommodations again, especially in Las Vegas. We were in a non smoking room, but the air circulation and quality in the establishment is just really poor and would wake up with a sore throat and an irritated nose. It was just plain gross and unhealthy. If you can afford it, go some place slightly nicer. n n2. Selection of food is not great. n nThe servers are really nice and service oriented, but there just is not a good selection of restaurants and cafes. n n3. House keeping is friendly. This is one redeeming quality of the place. They were sweet and prompt to deliver more towels and blankets when we requested them.",1
"Great selection of frames but primarily designer ones. Versace, Gucci, Armani etc. This meant there are no economical options and that was the bad part. I didn't get an eye check up here just went to buy my prescription glasses , appreciated their friendly service. Brad helped me find what I needed, very polite and patient with all the time I took! Certainly reccomend this optical store.",2
"Very slow service.waited 20 mins started with 3 others in front of me. Very very slow,.",1
"Let me start by saying that I don't really like strip clubs. That said, as long as you don't show up at 4AM and get one of the reserved tables upstairs, this place is sweet. The girls are comfortably aggressive, the place is clean enough and the bouncers are not always staring you down. The really attractive girls are few and far between but there are nuggets and the dancers are really cool too. The chicks hanging from the ceiling are a trip. If strip clubs are your thing, I would check this place out.",2
"Sushi Brokers is by far, my favorite sushi place in The Valley. I've been to quite a few different sushi restaurants, but Sushi Brokers has never disappointed. The location is great for those who live in the North Valley. n nThe selection of sushi is fantastic, and the best ones are the Chimichanga Roll the Sanchez Roll. They even beat the Las Vegas roll although that one is amazing too . The price is a little high, but it's a nice place, with a unique blend of sushi sports bar vibes. Compared to Ra, the food is probably a tad bit better at Sushi Brokers, but only because of the unique southwest influenced rolls. So in the end, it's worth 14 for a rather large Chimi roll we had 10 large pieces one time, instead of the usual 5 at Ra . n nMy only debbie downer about this place is the size. It's super tiny, and even though we have been seated right away every time, I'm waiting for the day that we have to go somewhere to kill some time while a seat opens up.",2
"I love this place. I come here every time I'm in Vegas. There's a great view of the fountains and it's always great weather. So why not? n nAnyway, the food is always delicious and service is spot on. We got some eggs benedict and . I can't remember what everyone else had but . YUMMY! The lunch here is great too. n nOne thing is that while being my birthday breakfast, I wish that they had something special for those occasions. But aside from that? I'm a fan.",2
"I expected good things from this place. It's in Vegas. has hot waiters in cowboy hats. country music . AND a mechanical bull. come on. Although the ambiance was fun, the food left a lot to be desired. n nI ordered the fried catfish. The portion was HUGE, but the fish was not fresh at all. They were basically pieces of catfish dipped in batter and then fried. The first piece I had I couldn't eat. They left on the dark meat and if the chef knew what he was doing, he'd know that that's where the blood is concentrated in the fish, making it taste fishy. I ditched that piece and ate one with only white meat, and it was obvious that the cat fish was not fresh. It tasted like it was frozen or has been sitting out for too long. They also overcooked their corn on the cob, which is something that annoys the daylights out of me when it comes to most American restaurants. n nMy boyfriend had brisket, which he didn't seem to be too happy about. I tried a piece and it was a little dry and hard, not moist, melt in your mouth, fall off the bone like a proper bbq should be. n nHowever, I will give them props on their hush puppies, which were delightfully flavorful. I also enjoyed the green bean casserole, but I could've easily made that at home. n nI don't agree with having to pay a cover charge to stand in the dance hall. even though we ate there. So, we didn't get to watch any bull riding. Will not go back again.",1
"Gibson's might be the best kept secret in Charlotte. I grew up going to Gibson's with my parents in the 80's and Reece the owner was really hard to understand because of a speech impediment but he worked hard and you always knew he'd take good care of your car. Sometimes you'd have to wait but the characters there would always keep you laughing. Now Larry Gibson Reece's son runs the shop and he's a real stand up guy. n nBasically, it's the place to go for quality car service. Unlike many other service centers you really feel like the workers give you advice based on what they would do if they were getting their car fixed. I have a Firestone service center 5 minutes from me and I still drive 25 minutes to go to Gibson. n nNext time you need an oil change or tires fixed give them a try.",2
"What is not to love about the Phoenix Zoo! Everything here is so much fun. You can walk around the Zoo or ride bikes. They have boats that you can rent and go all over the Zoo grounds. Every type of animal is here. You can get a good look at all of them. They do have food everywhere, and a really nice gift shop. The best part i think is the stingray bay, You can pet the stingrays and the sharks. You can even feed them. If you buy a membership, you can go any day, all day,come and go as you please. Lots of parking in the lot. There are lots of fun events all year long. Love the Zoo.",2
"Very disappointed in the manner in which the Cardinals and their ""Neanderthal "" staffing company handled my wife and I when we went to the practice event 8 5 2014 at UOP stadium. My wife has a disability and was gruffly treated and refused admittance at Gate 3 2 10 PM, and when we asked for a supervisor, HE WAS EVEN WORSE! We're contacting US DOJ about discrimination against disabled persons, but as excited as we might be with their team, we'll never go again and will try to dissuade others after our experience.",1
"Excellent meal and great service. Diver scallops were the best I ever had. Black cod was good, but a little pricey.",2
"I saw Dr. Hill and it was the worse experience. She came in 2 hours after me sitting there listening to the staff talk about groceries, lunch, husbands.etc. She did not introduce herself, sat down and said ""What are you here for "".hardly looked at me at all. Never followed up after the appointment though she said they would I called and basically was told nothing was wrong though obviously there is since I was in so much pain. Guess since it isn't them they don't really care. I was def a number instead of a person here and I will not be going back. When I expressed my concern to the front off gentlemen he said ""oh "". yep that's it! It's asinine that I have to spend 30 for them to do ABSOLUTLY nothing!",1
"You want a testament to how good the food is? My entire family came to visit from the east coast, and after a couple of days of hearing complaints about the food in AZ, I loaded them all up to make the drive out to Archie's. Every single one of them got just what they wanted, and RAVED about the quality! I was made to bring them all out to Archie's two more times over the next five days, and each time better than the last! After their return home, I had several phone calls with various family members about how much they loved Archie's! Not how good it was to see me, about the food at Archie's! Suffice to say next time they are out here, we'll be parked at a booth at Archie's for a good part of their visit! Thanks Archie's!",2
"I have mixed feelings about this bar. It's crowded. It's commercial and corny. The sexual innuendo is sophomoric. n nBut so what? It's fun! Join the other drunken crazies and sing along. Tip the singers, and they'll play a song of your choosing. Tip them even more, and they might let you take the spotlight and sing.",2
"This is the other location of Armstrong's. We've been to the other store many many times on First Friday, but we wanted to check this one out too. So, my friend and I went over there, kind of in an obscure location the parking lot is the entrance kind of odd . I don't think we would've found it on our own good thing we got some help by the owner she walked us through one alley and then we went to another I know, it sounds bad. It was empty though, the alleys. n nThis one is much smaller, much more organized, and not dusty at all. Items are usable, not junky. Very nice setup. I like that most things were grouped together so much easier to navigate. I also did not get the feeling that I would break things if I bumped into something, either. n nBTW The owner told us that prices are negotiable. We saw lots of neat things red goblets at 2 a piece, what a deal I don't need anything for my kitchen though . My friend wanted a closer look at some things glass covered case the owner was nice about showing her things. Jewelry was a little higher but since the owner said ""prices are negotiable "" I urged my friend to ask ""What's the best price you can give me for this peridot necklace? "" It was marked 70. First, she said, "" 50. "" And my friend replied, ""Will you take 45? "" So, great deal for a pretty piece has two chains I don't usually see that I'm a bit of a jewelry enthusiast . I was happy for my friend, because she's always searching for jewelry, but nothing really caught her eye at the other places. The owner said that she gets many pieces from the auction house and that it is open to the public. n nWe told the owner we would come there first next time for First Friday, since she closes early she told us that she doesn't get much traffic compared to the other store on Main she was nice enough to walk us there and reopen for us, specifically the other store owners called her they are family . And since we know that prices are not set in stone, it's certainly worth coming here, now isn't it?",2
"So our in store experience was good, but the alleged follow up service from this Apple Store has resembled the engineering ability of a newborn donkey.non existent. When we went into the store our service was great, the guy at the Genius bar said they would call us no later than Tuesday with the replacement they were to order. Tuesday came and went without a call, so did Wednesday. When we called on Thursday, we were handed off to a variety of different people, finally to hear that the replacement wasn't in, but should be on Saturday and they would call us. Lo and behold Saturday came and went without a phone call, so we called again. Same deal, now we were told the replacement would come in this week and we would be called. Hmmm.if I were a betting man I'd say we will have to call them again, what do you think? nI don't have a problem with Apple. I like my Ipod, its pretty cool technology, and it works pretty well as it should for the price . I am not a tech geek, but I am also not tech illiterate. I don't buy the hype of Apple, but I also don't hate them.but seriously, if you are going to claim a high level of service, please actually follow through. If crappy service happened just once, maybe I'd let it go, but this seems to be the MO of Apple.",1
"Can it get better than this? I almost don't want to give I Clean Carpets a five star rating and amazing review, because I want to keep him a secret!

I poped in for a quick lunch yesterday knowing they would probley have a buffet. they are'nt overly cheery to have you as a customer not that there rude there is no emotion at all.so i was told to take any table and off i went to the buffet you better be ready for chicken because thats the protien du jour one of the chicken dishes was quite tasty the other tandori was dry the spinich dish was good along w the naan the food was not bad but when i paid it was 11 a bit pricey.no.alot pricy for the selection of dishes.maybe there dinners are better but i most likly wont return to find out,1
This place did not seem clean and smelled like moldy towel. I don't think there is much more to say about that,1
"I really liked this place! Both of the appetizers we got were very flavorful. I've never had deep fried tofu that was so great in a while. The vegetarian egg roll was a little oily but still was good. The main course were amazing with HUGE , flavorful portions. Price was right. Service was spot on. Can't complain.",2
"I always get sick to my stomach after eating here. Ugh. I gave it one too many chances. And it's not even like it makes me sick but the service is great, no it's all just terrible! Don't eat here unless you need to barf for some reason. Lol.",1
"Tried Crackers Co. for the first time after trying TC Eggingtons the weekend before, and I'd have to say Crackers Co wins by a star. n nHad the Oscar Crabby Omelet which is a Saturday special, and it was perfect, light yet satisfying.

Can't wait till next weekend when I can try the California Benny or Blintzes crepes .",2
Went here today for lunch and was not impressed at all. We are local adults and have been wanting to try it but rarely have lunch time free. Everyone was served except us and we had 1 sandwich and a cup of soup and half sand. The soup was okay but the sandwich was so dry I almost choked and had to ask for some type of sauce. The pesto mayo had no flavor at all. We weren't sure why it took 20 mins when everyone in the place had been served that came in after and when we asked if was like why we bothered. Just not happy and won't be back. Unfriendly cashier as well. I can't stand when I pay someone's check and they don't even say hello!,1
"Perfect time with hubby, after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal, waitress was such an adorable girl.

"This place does not even deserve a star. The food made me like immedietly sick, couldn't make it to the bathroom fast enough. I ordered bacon and eggs over medium with hash browns. They brought my eggs cooked hard, with both yolks broken and potato chips. I received my wheat toast not kidding 10 minutes later. The place was filthy, the ceiling was crusted in grease, they don't seem to have ever changed those ceiling tiles. The windows appear to have neve been cleaned, and the floors, lets just say a mud floor is cleaner. I will NEVER go back there again, it wasn't worth the runs!",1
"Portofino's is one of my favorite in Charlotte. Good NY style pizza is always a hit, but the real draw is the amazing homemade style sauces used for their various pasta and other Italian dishes. My favorite dish is their Chicken Parm. The dining area is small and a bit cramped and the wait for a table during dinner can be long, but once seated the service is fine and you can also call ahead as their take out service is efficient and the prices are reasonable. Based on multiple visits and take out orders.",2
"First off, it's conveniently located only a couple blocks from the old port, and a couple steps off both metro square victoria and bonaventure. n nFor the food, my wife and I shared the 20oz bone in ribeye for 2, whcih included a salad, green beans and unlimited frites fries as well as some special sauces for dipping. The overall menu is limited, maybe 8 main course options that include duck confit, salmon, filet mignon, rib steak and others. Appetizers include calamari, French onion soup, escargot, etc. We had the soup and escargot.delicious. Service was also exceptional, they were friendly and responsive. I wore jeans, and when we went they were playing a hockey game on tv, so pretty casual overall. n nThe best part is it's byob, and their is an SAQ in the old port and a couche tard across from bonaventure metro stop. n nWith appetizer, tax and tip, figure about 50 per person. Would go again and recommend to a friend. Provided 4 stars because they did not offer for us to take home the left overs, instead they just took everything.",2
"For an in depth knowledge of the cultures, the arts and anything related to Native American history, this place provides all that and more. n nIt's 15 for admission and 7.50 for students.

There are a lot of ""hands on "" exhibits as well so you can learn stuff by touch it. n nDozens of paintings, head masks, a whole room devoted to doll collection and much much more can be found here. They also show the transition of how the Native Americans became ""civilized "" by forcing them into schools and acting properly in the general population. n nOther favorites include the rugs room where all the rugs were pretty much made by hand and they all looked pretty neat. n nThey have museum store as well where a lot of the stuff made by Native Americans can be sold here.

"Contrary to everyone else, we really enjoyed our free movie experience. Super friendly grand opening staff . almost bordering on Disney esque enthusiasm.

Allowed me to sub the typical fries for a small side salad romaine . n nChicken fried steak ok, came w hearty portion of mashed red potatoes and snap peas. n nSmokey salmon sandwich would order this again, came with chips n nTriple berry stack unmemorable n nChocolate brownie and ice cream warm and delicious",2
"WE had booked our holiday party 6 weeks ahead for 13 at Ilios and all were really looking forward to it. They had a hostess call less than 2 days before the party to let us know that they couldn't accomodate us. First they said it was a ""management function "" and then changed the story that someone else booked the room. They did not offer any other accomodations in the restaraunt to make up for this oversight and have left us without a place to hold our party! Very poor customer service not acceptable!",1
"We have tried this place two times since my review and I have to say we have seen an amazing turn around. One of the owners did reach out to me, and apologized for the experience.

Prior to my visit I checked the prices online and when I arrived the menu price was different. I asked if they were going to honor that price and the hostess told me that they needed to update the menu online. I went to this restaurant because of the price and for them not to honor what they are advertising is unacceptable.,1
"Chicken fried steak! Thats all Im going to say. They give you huge portions for the price. The only thing I felt uncomfortable about is the tightness of the place. Its always packed and there is barely any room to walk. This can easily be solved by calling in the order and just picking it up. Bottom line, food is great but place is a bit tight.",2
"OK, I am a local, not a snowbird and I am always looking for a good down to earth restaurant. I should have gone running from the restaurant when I saw Kale on the menu. Kale is the new ""in thing "". Yuck! very few people in the restaurant at 2 PM on a Saturday and the service was so so. The Pomegranate meatballs were alright but nothing special. How do you ruin a roast beef sandwich? well, it is supposed to arrive hot. It arrives warm on top and ice cold in the center. Served on a very small roll that had obviously been tasted maybe a few hours before, hard on the edges. Our friends had the saddens and said they were good. One friend had a ham and cheese sandwich and said the ham was very salty. I tried it and he was right, too much salt. Overall not what I expected and too expensive for the small portions. Can't anyone open a good, restaurant with good old fashioned food that does not have kale or pig belly on the menu?",1

If you are using corporate rate, she will try her hardest not to honor any of the decent upgrade options or even make it impossible by dis allowing certain cars from the category you are trying to upgrade! With what authority I don't know! n nAgain it is only one I won't hesitate to steer clear next time after the 3rd consecutive experience. And sorry won't take the name so can't help much there but here is some advice Do not hesitate to call the manager if you encounter similar experience. She might even lie that the manager just left for the day but obviously somebody is in charge every time and mostly more responsible so highly likely you will be heard. No other reason this facility will deserve anything less than 4 stars.",1
"It felt like I was in the bowels of a sea faring ship. It has a historic pub feel, the food was beautifully presented and tasty I had a salmon salad and the service was excellent.",2
"Good food, cute d u00e9cor, great location, but definitely overpriced. nWe had the muffaletta sp? and a chicken and walnut salad, and both were very good, but they were 18 and 15, so kinda high for lunch. nThey have a good beer selection and happy hour deals, so I might return some day.",2
"Great hotel! Front desk was helpful and polite, even when I checked in at 2am. Bed was super comfortable. The Jr. Suite was huge, clean and quiet. Kitchenette was stocked with pots and pans and anything else you need to cook. Fridge was bigger than your usual hotel fridge. We stayed in Tower 3, which is the furthest away, and it took about 8 minutes to walk to MGM. The pathway was fully enclosed, air conditioned and had moving walkways the majority of the time. Best hotel I've ever stayed in. Oh! and the Rueben sandwich at Delights is the best damn Rueben I've ever had.",2
"The absolute lowest of the low, Shoe Zone really is only for those whom have lost their last shreds of dignity, self respect, and legal tender. It's customer base is made up entirely of ""domestic assistants "" cleaners and those guys that work in the change booths at dodgy car parks, only lifting their heads up from their wank mags once in a blue moon to lift the barriers. n nIf broken Britain could ever be epitomised through a smell, it's through the stench of cheap leather and provident loan applications that permeates through Shoe Zone. Hideous.",1
"Our Brunch Was very disappointing. . Fish wasn't cooked, bread was rubbery, prime rib had no flavor. Sushi was tasteless, mexican rice overcooked. Desserts were cheap, gelato not good. Overpriced as far as quality. The place was very nice. Great decor. I had the best seat in the house.",1
"My wife and I were visiting Vegas over the weekend and some friends took us to Cafe Rio for lunch on Monday. Walking in I thought it was sort of Chipotle esq and was wondering why it was so packed. Now I know! n nI had the sweet pork barbacoa burrito ""enchilada style "". I am still daydreaming about it days later. I wouldn't shed a tear if all the Chipotles and Qdobas here where I live, in Colorado Springs, closed down and were replaced by Cafe Rio. n nThat burrito was unbelieveable. Perfectly savory, seasoned, spicy, sweet, and moist pork. The rice and beans, and the green chili sauce on top weren't a distraction from the barbacoa but were just right. n nDamn. Why am I writing this review? I'm just making myself hungry thinking about Cafe Rio.",2
Really clean and awesome amounts of flavors. High quality and tasty flavors. Good service from the staff on a weekday evening. n nMy 4 star rating is due to the price which I felt was bit much for one scoop.,2
Bad customer service. Unreliable.,1
"Not only is the view amazing, but the food was delicious. I went here with my husband well boyfriend at the time the first time I went out to Vegas to visit him after he moved there for work. He was so excited about bringing me there and getting to sit out on the patio which overlooks the Bellagio's water show. The night we went out it started to rain one of the 3 days it actually rains there and he was so disappointed about not being able to sit outside. He talked to the host and let them know we had made reservations for the patio and they were able to sit us right next to the window so we could see the show throughout dinner even thought the patio was closed. The show is 15 feet from you, and yet the sound only carries slightly inside so it does not get annoying or to loud. The view is beautiful at night, and the staff is attentive without being overbearing. My water was always full and they use a crumb scraper in between courses so there are no little bread crumbs lying around. The menu has a big enough selection to please everyone, but doesn't have so many options that you feel overwhelmed. The filet melts in your mouth! The lighting is dim which I loved, but I have heard older people complain that it was too dark for them. Overall I think this was a great place in Vegas where you actually get what you pay for. Our meals were probably around 65 a piece without drinks, and I would have paid that for the view alone this was my first time viewing the Bellagio fountains and I think it was the best way to view it. When I moved to Vegas I always recommended this place to anyone out visiting",2
"My sisters, my mom, and myself stopped in on a whim for lunch one day and were blown away by not only the food but the service. It is simple food such as sandwiches and soups, but they make you want to try every item on their menu. We ended up bringing my dad back the next day to try breakfast because our lunch was so good. We also went back another day for lunch with the whole family again 6 of us , so not exactly a small party. We had a different server each time and each one was as good as the last. One even had another employee run and buy grenadine for a drink my dad ordered. Even when we modified orders to our liking or added soups and whatnot, they were always willing to accommodate. It is well worth stopping in and the employees earned their tips with the above and beyond service they provided. I am looking forward to visiting AZ again and heading to Crackers for breakfast and lunch!",2
"Although I am an avid Bellagio Hotel stayer, I must say, their service has gone lower with each stay. n nPros nWhile it's still amongst my top favorite places to stay, there are arising issues. The rooms are impeccable! The hotels have soft beds, spacious bathrooms, and newly renovated! Location is great! Pretty centrally located. Decent amount of restaurants. Great Walk through garden! Awesome poker room! Amongst my top 3 in Las Vegas! Pretty good shopping stores LV, Chanel, Hermes etc. I also like how there is security at the elevators checking keys. Safety first n nCons nA complaint I have is with billing. EVERY single time I have stayed here, the bill has been wrong. I've seen double resort fees per day meaning instead of 25 day for resort fees I am accidently charged 50 day , food credit is always forgotten to be taken off, and I've even seen double the tax then what it should be. The problem really lies when once you've fixed the problem at the front desk and head home. you see your credit card statement THERE IT IS AGAIN! Very annoying to call billing to fix over the phone since phone waits take forever! Majority of the time they are accommodating and professional, but not always. Also, lines are long, but it's not too bad. Staff overall are pretty good and usually try to fix problems quickly. n nI do recommend this hotel and will be staying again just check your bill statements!",2
"My experience here was ok. I am new to town and wanted to get my nails done on a holiday, fortunately they were open. However, like most nails shops like this they were trying to do too much at once. The gentleman who did my nails had no conversation for me, not sure if it was because he was so busy watching what everyone else was doing or because he was tending to his, approximately, 10 year old son. Either way I'm still on the hunt for a regular salon and would probably only go here in an emergency.",1
"I came here with the expecation of purchasing an iPhone 4s. The gentleman that helped me out in the mobile department seemed genuinely uninterested in helping us out. I had to probe and probe for help and to obtain answers to questions. I felt like I was inconveniencing the poor fella. Once we told him we were uninterested in the ""black tie protection plan "" his interest in helping us legitimately hit zero. At this point the wife and I left. n It's no wonder people are choosing to take their shopping over to Amazon. Their customer service is unmatched! I was willing to pay a little extra to have a phone then and there, however, after dealing with that dude, I took my disgruntled self over to Amazon and waited a couple of days for my nifty new iPhone.",1
"It pains me to give Nove 2 stars. It use to be my go to for fancy Italian. My favorite place in Las Vegas. I would have given every experience before this one 5 stars. Now, I will never return. nMy first time here was for my boyfriends birthday a few years ago. Since then we had been back for a Chef's tasting with Chef Geno with 15 courses. A few of our favorite dishes included the risotto of the day, Nana's meatballs, chicken Marsala, and the death by potatoes. This was my first and only time dining here since the chef I had grown to love moved on to other ventures. nI still had faith that Nove would be a great place without Chef Geno. The menu was almost the same. The crowd wasn't. The waiter even mentioned when we asked, that the new chef was ""completely different "". Not bad, just not the same. nWell I think he was being polite. The exact same chicken Marsala dish looked the same but tasted totally different. The meatballs and potatoes were still decent. The gnocchi was too mushy. And the risotto, oh I wouldn't know as they offered it as the special, and then ran out. I waited 20 minutes and ate my entire appetizer before my drink arrived. And there was no new chef coming out to check on us, see how we liked the food, or introduce himself. This always happened in past times when Nove was not busy. Considering we were there late, and the Chef was in view it could have happened. nMaybe my expectations were set too high, but I have had totally different experiences in the past. All of them made me feel great about spending 150 300 for dinner for 2. nRight now I am thankful I had a discount on my tickets from the Lisa Lampanelli show, because I would have been mad to pay full price last night. nI really hope N9NE group and Nove figure out a way to put the pieces back together. Chef Geno, we miss you!",1
"The folks at Apex salvaged a very disappointing day. I had a new dryer delivered this morning that was too big for my space. The delivery techs were already gone. After much finagling and fussing and a few frustrated tears during which I knocked a hose off my washer, flooding the laundry room I got the new one out of the way and drove to Apex. Should have made them my first stop. They had a few to choose from, the prices were unbeatable, and they were very helpful in explaining how to best fit. The son delivered, installed, took away the old broken one, and even got my washer back together within the hour. Turns out we're neighbors so I'm confident they know what will work in my old house. Unless I can afford a total remodel, from now on, I'll check with Apex Used Appliances before making any new purchases.",2
"This review applies to all locations, this sub shop franchise should be sued for false advertising. I had to buy a few lunches at their Galleria location and this is my experience. n n1 The ""home cooked "" bread is not even close to resembling or tasting of French bread or like Italian either. Wonder bread and mayo is what it tastes like, totally unacceptable in 2012 when you can buy a semi decent French baguette in any supermarket. n n2 ""No can toast the bread, sorry "". Really? n n3 There's nothing remotely gourmet about any of their ingredients, cold cuts, cheeses, salads, nothing. n n4 False cheers are simply annoying n nJust a few blocks North on Monroe is ""The Southern Gourmet "" cafe. Now the sandwiches cost twice as much and the service is sloooooooow but the food is a gourmet treat.",1
"Terrible, terrible service.waiter seemed annoyed the whole time. Won't be back!",1
Very tasty fish taco. The full taco w the chile is a bigger size and very flavorful. I recommend getting one of each.,2
"Ay yi yi! I hate leaving bad reviews but sadly, this one is deserved. I'm a bridesmaid in a friend's upcoming wedding and the bride decided to order the bridesmaids dresses from here. Everything was fine and good.until the bridesmaids dresses failed to arrive by the promised date. The poor bride and maid of honor made repeated frantic calls to see if the store could put a rush on the dresses or at the very least, provide a new estimated arrival date. The staff here was very rude and unprofessional they never once apologized for the delayed dresses, got flustered and angry on the phone, and refused to pay any extra amount to have the dresses rushed so they would actually arrive on time. Very bad customer service! In the end, the dresses arrived a mere week before the wedding, the bride had to pay out of pocket to overnight them to out of town bridesmaids, and we all had to pay extra to have them rush tailored. n nIf you're a bride, save yourself some unnecessary stress and find another place to look for your wedding accessories! Bad bad BAD!",1
"For what you pay, the Deuce is totally worth it. n nIf you are short on time and want to get to point A to point B as quickly as possible, the Deuce is not for you. n nIf you have two hours or more to get from one end of the strip to the other, the Deuce is the way to go. n nThe best seats are in the front row of the top deck. For some reason, some of the buses have some sort of protective layer on the windows that ruins your pictures I'm a picture taking machine but the front seats don't have this.",2
"I love this place. The flavors are great. The store is very well themed. I do wish they had extended hours, especially when events are happening downtown in the evening. nA flavor for everyone!",2
We have eaten here twice and both times the service has been great. I highly suggest making sure you get reservations though. Totally kid friendly too!,2
"How very disappointing! I had lunch at The Skinny Italian several months ago and couldn't wait to go back. The bolognese sauce was one of the best I've had in a restaurant when compared to my very own . Last night my husband and I went with two other couples. I had called ahead for a reservation and asked for a table, not a booth, for 6, but when we arrived, the front table, evidently the only one for 6 or 8 had to be set up for six. The server was very new and appeared afraid to take our orders. We ordered drinks but had to change our order since they were out the beer ordered and a wine we wanted. We were offered a taste of a Pinot Grigio which was very nice but we ordered a different wine. The stuffed mushroom appetizer and the escargot were average at best. The service was extremely slow even though there were very few in the restaurant. When the food arrived, I was really disappointed in the bolognese on my angel hair pasta. I really had been looking forward to the tasty sauce I previously had. The sauce was bitter and did not have a great flavor. My husband's puttanesca sauce was good but the chicken he ordered with it was evidently boiled and had an unusual color. Two at our table did enjoy their meals, a penne with clams and the puttanesca penne without the chicken. Unfortunately, we won't be going back. After my lunch there, I had recommended the restaurant to many friends.now, I'll have to add a caveat to go without my hearty recommendation.",1
"Ok food, but horrible service had to ask several times for water. Waitress never checked back in to see how the meal was. It took her three trips to finally ask if we were ready to order etc. Would not recommend and wished I read the other reviews first. They all say the same thing about service. Total bummer because the space is pretty.",1
"They have hidden fees. 15 bucks for even slight status changes, 30 day wait periods, manager unavailable to talk to. Its easy to join, tough once you are a member",1
"I am going to go against the grain here and give this a 2 not because some of the stuff is not really nice, but I just feel that it is a bit meh. nI have lived just up the road for about 10 years off and on, and have been a regular at victor hugo for all that time, but this latest incarnation has failed from the start. n nI must say, I do like their hot rolls and their danishes, and the coffee is ok but the service is PAINFULLY slow over 15 minutes to make 4 americanos and we were 2nd in the queue! There just doesn't seem to be a 'system' or order to the place. I would also say that the small amount of fresh produce is really a bit sorry, the limes were so withered and just not what I would expect from such a place. Yes, the hot food is good, but and I might be wrong I feel that a lot of the stuff is bought in the cakes and the sandwich fillings in particular. n nThere are nice products to buy, but they seem to have all been picked just because they have a taste award or some award given to them. I don't really get the feeling that they use the local potential as much as a 'foodie' shop like that should be doing. Additionally, although a lot of the products are decent, many of them are not particularly unique they are availible in supermarkets or other Edinburgh delis for less u00a3 u00a3 u00a3. n nIf I am making up a hamper for someone, I would possibly look in here for inspiration because it is handy, but I know from experience that I generally use Demijohn for my oils and places such as Clark's and Mellis for chutneys and cheese. n nA true case of style over substance, but I am sure I will succumb to the black pudding roll again in the future.",1
"I'm in love. Great dishes, made with fresh ingredients quickly. Small, unassuming place with very attentive staff. Plus a 7 is an 11 at a lesser place. MUST COME BACK",2
"Most items on the menu contain pork or sausage. I had the Kung Pao Fried Chicken without the Chinese sausage. Came with confit potatoes, peas, peanuts, and this delicious chili sauce on your choice of brown or white rice. The chicken had just the right amount of spice. It was delicious! Wish we had one of these in D.C.",2
"My wife, myself, and some friends all decided to go here. My wifes friends were treating due to all the help we did with their wedding. Its a very nice place, in a very nice area. Everyone was friendly and the service was good up to a point. n nI seemed to get the short end of the stick at dinner. I had the scallops and greanbean thing. My scallops where all burnt on one side, and even the greenbeans were burnt. I joked about it with the waitress, who did apologize, and wanted to replace it but after waiting so long I was pretty hungry from waiting so long. Wheres Gordon Ramsey when you need him checking the food? Everyone elses dinner in our party appeared to be good from what they said. n nThere was some shadiness when we went to pay the bill. Our friends had a gift card, and added a 100 cash on top. She got the gift card back, with change on the gift card. To me, this is a big no no. Gift card gets used first, and then give us cash back please! Now because of the money being put on the card, she didnt have enough for a proper tip. After she dropped the card off, she pretty much disappeared so we didnt have a chance to ask about it. Oh well, she got a less of a tip because of it. n nAfterwards it was nice to walk around the shops and window browse.",1
really cool place for brunch very vegan vegetarian friendly. great service and fresh food options!,2
"I've lived in Scottsdale for over 20 years and have played every public course in the area and there are only a couple ""go to "" courses that I recommend and We Ko Pa is one of them. One of the best features of both courses is the fact that there are ZERO homes on the property. It is just you and nature. The two courses are distinctly different. Cholla is the original course and more dramatic. It is also a more true desert target golf layout with elevated greens, lots of desert, some tight fairways, washes, etc. The Saguaro has some great views and is more forgiving. It was also designed to be walked very few courses in AZ can say this . Don't be fooled though, it still plays tough as there are a lot of bumps and humps that you need to work around. n nAZ residents get a break on the pricing. However, I consider the courses better than most of the more popular courses in the area that charge more. Definitely put this on your MUST PLAY list.",2
"Erin Go Bring Me my Check! n nI applaud Seamus McCaffrey for taking it slow when opening his sister pubs Rosie's and now Turf , but this pub near Sens, PastaBAR, and The Breadfruit has some serious deficits to remedy. n nI took my Phoenix transplant friend, Katie C, for a late breakfast on Saturday around 11am before our trip to Downtown Phoenix Public Market. n nPassing through the modest patio at the entrance to The Turf Accountant , we entered a large open space with dark, wood paneling, polished metallic speckled concrete floors, drop down Starbucks reminiscent glass lamps, and not a single visible patron to be found. The glossy, just opened cleanliness of the pub made it look like a miniature Yard House Restaurant four flat panel TVs displaying futbol and basketball, too far away to follow, too TV ish to ignore, suggesting, ""We are pub for a quiet pint.No, we are music venue see the stage! .No, we are a wee modest sportsbar. "" Conflicted. n nAt the bar, I flipped through the menu to see if breakfast was still being served, and I was told by the bartender that the posted Sat Sun Mon breakfast hours of 7 10am had been extended to noon. I mean, really, who's racing to the pub for breakfast before 10am on a weekend? n nWe chose a booth along a side wall and noted that the swirled, multi green upholstery was either retro or contemporary or both. Conflicted. When we sat down, the server at a nearby booth rose from her intimate conversation with a blond man and asked us for our drink orders. Coffee and water. n nAfter some deliberation and discussion of real Irish soda bread, Katie ordered the french toast and I ordered the Traditional Irish Breakfast, minus the meat sausage or bacon black and white pudding . To her credit, the server said I'd be wasting money with that order and should order the simple eggs and hashbrowns and substitute in the fried tomato and soda bread. I asked for poached eggs, but the server returned minutes later, saying, ""We don't have poached eggs. "" Okay, then, over medium. n nOur breakfast arrived quickly by now, only one other two top was being served in the palatial pub. The french toast ""Some of the best french toast I've had, "" Katie said came with a giant ramekin of butter but no syrup. We asked for the syrup, and at the end of the meal, Katie almost asked for the butter to go it was seriously an entire stick of butter. n nMy egg breakfast didn't have the side of fried tomato a staple of English and Irish breakfasts , and when I asked for it, she brought two sad mealy tomato slices, unfried. The soda bread was dense and dry and bland and dotted with four measly raisins. n nThroughout the service, our distracted waitress think Reese Witherspoon Jewel was pleasant but forgetful. She spent her time between tables sitting with the blond man in the booth, close talking and smiling. Was he another waiter or her boyfriend? I joked to Katie that I should bring a girlfriend to my classroom and give her smooches in between the grammar lessons I teach. She filled my water and coffee often, but her casual presence at the booth across from us blurred the lines of professionalism. n nThe bill for two breakfasts including substitutions, which she didn't charge for and a coffee was 16. Very reasonable. I guess we got what we paid for. n nKatie noted that most people don't choose an Irish pub for their breakfast brunch, but the Turf hardly tried, it seemed. And with Palatte closing, I wanted to give Seamus a shot. n nI will definitely return in the evening to have a 5.50 Imperial Pint of Guiness, but I will not return for breakfast.",1
"Second time to stay here. I stayed here one time when it was the Las VEgas Hilton. Seem like a better hotel then. n nRecent stay was just so so. The room is comfortable but it is old. The lower part of the door to the bathroom was all chipped. When I took a shower the first night there, the shower curtain had ink stains on it. The following day I left a note for housekeeping to change the shower curtain and they did. So service is great. The rooms are comfortable, but the hotel itself, is far from the strip. n nThere was a convention going on during the time we were there. I wonder what the hotel is like when there is no one around? n nParking is free, but it is a walk? Not bad if you just had a heavy dinner. For the elderly, it would be tough. n nOverall, it's ok, but I have other options.",1
"Ok nThis place is cheap n3.5 hours, including massage, pedicure and facial 130 n nIt's in a strip mall. nIsn't the newest prettiest flashiest place. nBut I thought the massage was awesome and the prices were great!",2
"Completely unimpressed. Went here on Friday for my birthday expecting good things. I was pretty disappointed at the end. I was with quite a few people and they all concurred. The sushi was boring and bland, very small rolls especially considering the price. Our server was sweet but not very fast and took forever to come back and take our food orders. Our food came out staggered with huge gaps in between a big no no at restaurants, timing is everything . One of my friend's beers came out completely warm WTF? The only good thing was that the drinks were strong and the staff was friendly. This place was a miss for me.",1
"We love Japanese food and figured we would try this since it was in our hotel. We ordered their two for meal and spent almost 90. Included in this meal was miso soup, salad and two choices of things off one special menu. We got some sushi rolls. It was just okay, nothing like Koi. The service was pretty good. The hot sake was the best part of the meal though.",1
"Waited 15 minutes when it was empty only to be told, ""Sit where you want if you still want to eat here. "" Food was room temperature. Toast had mold on it. Worst Denny's ever!",1
"Review for Sam's Town Live n n Sam's Town Live has been a 4 star venue to spectate WWE pay per views. It is cool to cheer the good guys and boo the heels with hundreds of fellow WWE fans. n n The beer and Nachos are inexpensive. I correct myself, the beer is a bargain. n n Sadly I won't be enjoying it this year. After getting on line hours early, I learned that you need a master ticket to wait on the line. Lesson learned. n n With this said, my TIP is to get to Sam's Town hours ahead of the pay per view, and make sure you pick up a master ticket from promotions before you wait on line.",2
"Groupon has allowed me to try new restaurants in places I never knew existed.I Have been to uptown many times and never noticed Fox and Hound. That could also be Rock Bottom Brewery sits across the street and makes this place seem so much smaller. My visit was at 2pm and we experienced some difficulty with parking. It also is DNC week and parking is off limits except for a few places along the street. Luckily we found one after circling 4 times. We walked in and it was awkward. One of those moments that you see in movies where a bar is noisy everyone stops and stares then goes about their business. Normally this isn't an issue but when the waitress and bartender does this its.awkward. We found a booth and sat and waited to be greeted. We waited, looked around and waited some more. Began looking around saw a bartender and that was it. No waitress no one else walking around. Wasn't sure if we should have sat at the bar to be noticed, or like in elementary school raise our hands to have permission to speak. It would have probably made a difference to recieve a smile or simple hello from the person behind the bar, then we probably wouldn't have felt forgotten. After 14 minutes we finally met our waitress who asked us if we needed more time to review the menu. Really? We counted 3 parties, thats it.in a otherwise bare restaurant. Food was good, received it pretty quickly. Our drinks were refilled often without being asked. First impressions really do matter. It wouldn't have mattered from that point if service was perfect. Don't ignore someone intentionally when they obviously know you can see them. From reading other reviews it seems that we aren't the only ones who experienced the same issues. Really felt like we were being intentionally ignored. We did something we have never done. Intentionally left without leaving a tip. The one person who was polite happened to be the person who was in the next room cleaning. Kinda ironic since she doesn't assist the people actually dining. Will not be back.",1

New to this restaurant, she stands around in the entryway wondering if she should seat herself? She approaches the register at the back of the restaurant. nCustomer Hi, I've never been here before. Do I seat myself? nServer Oh. Hold on. "" walks away for a few minutes, comes back to counter and grabs menus, plops them on nearby table, walks away n.ok? n nACT TWO nServer Can I get you anything to drink? nCustomer Yes, I'd like a Vietnamese coffee please note they offer both hot and iced Vietnamese coffee, and the server does not ask which kind n ten minutes pass, server approaches table with iced coffee nCustomer Oh, I'm sorry. I ordered the hot coffee? nServer You didn't say that you wanted it hot. n Right. But I didn't say I wanted it iced, either. I think that's your job? n Server makes a face and walks away, hollering in Vietnamese n nACT THREE n After eating about 1 3 of her veggie pho, Customer asks for a To Go box for her food, and for her friend's food. Friend goes to the bathroom. Server returns with checks. nServer Does your friend need a box for her food? nCustomer Yes, she also wants a box. n Server picks up Customer's 1 3 eaten bowl of soup and walks away. Customer, who recently went to the AMAZING Lang Van restaurant on the other side of town, was expecting him to bag up her food for her, as they do at LANG VAN WHICH IS A WAY BETTER PLACE TO EAT OK n After Customer and Friend pay and are getting ready to leave, Customer realizes she never got her food back nCustomer Excuse me, where did my soup go? I asked for a To Go box? nServer No you didn't. nCustomer Um, I did actually. nServer unrepentant We threw it away. n Customer leaves the store, but is a little confused. She did, after all, pay for the entirety of her meal. And as Friend confirms, she asked for a To Go box for herself earlier. It all just doesn't seem fair. So she goes back in to try to figure out a solution and possibly redeem the situation.

I'm a little confused. I just paid for my entire meal, ate less than half of it and now, despite asking to finish it, won't get to? nCrypt Keeper instantly furious YOU DID NOT SAY YOU WANTED BOX. nCustomer .Um, I'm sorry, but I did. I said that we both wanted boxes. You weren't anywhere near my table when I said I wanted a box. nCrypt Keeper WE CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MISTAKE. nCustomer trying hard to be reasonable I don't really understand how it's my mistake when I told my server that I wanted a box? nCrypt Keeper YOU NEED TO SAY YOU WANT BOX. WE CAN'T GIVE AWAY FOOD. nCustomer But you're not. I paid for my food, and you threw away my food. I just want my portion of my food. that I paid for.? nCrypt Keeper FINE. I WILL GIVE YOU BROTH AND NOODLES. NEXT TIME, DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE. n nUm, lady, there will NEVER BE a next time and I am definitely going to make sure that no one I ever know will have to deal with you and your terrible establishment ever again. n nAAAAAND. SCENE! n nAs someone who works in customer service and regularly gets reamed by customers, I did everything in my power to remain calm, level headed and most of all KIND to the people I was encountering when all of this was happening. I cannot possibly understand why, as a paying customer, I was treated like I was the person serving the establishment that I was eating at. I wasn't asking for much just MY food that I PAID FOR. And I really can't understand how why this place stays in business when the servers regularly do not listen to or HELP their customers? n nTLDR Go to Lang Van. Or Three Amigos. Or freaking McDonald's. I don't care. Just spare yourself the indignity and eat elsewhere.",1
"all i have to say about the buffet here is BLECH.it's not SO bad that it gets only 1 star, but it's far inferior to buffets i've tried elsewhere in vegas i.e. bellagio .especially for the price.for roughly 35 person, it's money better spent elsewhere.and actually, now that i think about it, yuck, i would not eat here again n nlike most vegas buffets, they had an assortment of cuisines, but nothing really stood out.they had king crab legs, prime rib, steak, turkey and sushi stations.sure it SOUNDS good, but don't let your eyes and ears trick you.everything tasted a little off, i feel like nothing was fresh! and i would DEFINITELY avoid the sushi and i'm pretty sure the shrimp was the thaw and serve kind.also, each person get's HALF a lobster with their meal.but again, didn't taste that fresh and they don't clean them very well so it wasn't a very appetizing presentation.and when i mean not clean them very well, lobster poo was still all up in there.i know for some folks out there, they just eat that sh t up, but for me, no thanks because seriously, do you serve kobe beef with a side of poo, no! n nso overall review, either their food had been sitting out for awhile, or it was thaw and serve.blech blech blech.i mean, for it to be in the ARIA hotel and have TROPICANA quality buffet, i would totally skip n ndesserts were AWFUL.the selection was limited and again, nothing tasted quite right.i would go with the creme brulee, i mean seriously, you have to be tastebudless to get that classic dessert wrong n nnot to sound like a lush, but the only saving grace is the fact they had unlimited wine included in the 35.i'm sure it's boxed wine, but compared to the tasteless slop they were serving, the wine tasted like rainbows n noh, FYI, after dinner and for the rest of the night i had the worst heartburn stomach ache.i'm convinced it was the lobster!",1
"If you want real Greek food, don't eat here. One look at the menu and I was concerned. They had pizza, salads, pasta, sandwiches and burgers. The Greek fare was limited to the most popularized dishes. Maybe you could say it's a Greek inspired menu. They seem to want to cover all the bases. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants and this place reinforced that. If you want a more authentic Greek food experience try Greektown on 7th Street. n nThis restaurant has been around for years and I know people who think it's great. My brother and his wife eat here regularly and have good things to say about it. So when they invited us to tag along, I thought why not? I should have declined. I am sure I'll never eat here again. n nWe were immediately turned off because there had been a cigar smoker out on the patio turns out it was the owner and since the doors were propped open, you could smell the cigar inside. Gross. We asked to move to another table further away. n nThe best part of the meal was the calamari appetizer, which was nicely battered and not overcooked. It was served with a marinara sauce and a roumelade sauce. A nice touch perhaps, but that's not Greek. We shared a pitcher of red sangria which was overly sweet and didn't taste like it had much wine in it. n nI chose the lamb shanks which were OK but nothing special. They were served with lemon potatoes which were extremely salty and steamed veggies which were pretty limp. This dish also comes with Greek rice but I asked not to get a second starch in lieu of more veggies. If we got more veggies then it was a pretty skimpy portion. nMy brother got the gyro platter. The meat looked like leather. I tried a piece and it was dried out and unappetizing. Hey, gyro meat should be one of the best things at a place like this. I cannot recommend this restaurant. n nOh well, live and learn.",1
"Very unhappy with the experience of having to stand outside forever and then inside. The people inside suck ass as well, very rude inconsiderate and not helpful at all. If you don't like your job find a new one. Seriously.",1
"First it was sensory overload with the lights, video and overly loud music. Second, the food was too hyped up for me, so the 45 min wait was not worth it on a Tuesday. n n Sea Bass skewers good but nothing extra special. n Bobo Brazil roll couldn't really taste the ingredients, the sauce took over n Yamato roll sounded way better on paper. again, couldn't taste the ingredients as it was sauced up. n the sushi came with its own wasabi, which is perfectly fine, except they put way too much. The taste of the fish was masked by it. n nOverall, I wouldn't go back.",1
Back again and didn't disappoint. Had the nocchi bolognese and hands down the best I've ever had. So good I'll never eat them again unless I'm there. Eric still a rock star. Can't miss top 5 restaurant all time.,2
"Ok, so this was my very first time at the RF and I thought it was a blast. Maybe it's because I was brought here on a date and was totally spoiled to the max! n nI still give this place a 4 star rating because the overall experience at the end of the night was amazing! n nCON nHowever, we didn't make reservations and went around 6 p.m., it was Happy Hour and the bar was pact to the brim. We were told that the next reservation open would be at 8 30 p.m. and we didn't want to wait, so the waitress told us that the bar and patio tables were first come, first serve. There were no tables open for us and we couldn't even make it to the bar to put in some drink orders, some customers were rude and it really agitated me and I thought this whole experience was going to suck. nEDIT Also, the waitress, well, we hardly saw her. n nPRO nThe BF, on the other hand, thought that it would be a better idea to go shopping and then come back later during the 8 30 reservation time. And boy was he right. What a difference it made to be at the restaurant from a different perspective, no crowd shoving, rude people, etc. n nDRINKS n The BF had several different kinds of beers I tried a bit of them all , but we were a bit disappointed that they didn't have any on tap. n I had the ""Octoberfest "" I don't remember who made it, but the beer tasted a bit sweet, kinda chocalateee' n I also had a ""Prickly Pear Mojito "" which was very good, but a little too sweet for my taste, oh and the bartender was pretty generous too! n nFOOD nWe had a three course meal! n For our appetizer they gave us bread and butter, and then we ordered ""The New Mexico Fondue Pot Lamb Chops "" three piecesof lamb and some bits of chili pastacio bread, rosemary bruchette and butternut squash and boy was that tasty. n The BF ordered a the ""BIg Ass Burger "" and I ordered probably the most expensive thing on the menu, the ""Filet Mignon "". I ordered it 'blue', my favorite way, and yes, they got it right! it was just tad salty, but still really yummy! n For a side, we shared the ""Green Chili Macaroni, which we barely finished, but made for an excellent thick late night snack. microwaved n Dor dessert, I ordered a Brownie Lava cake , a la mode! It went excellent with coffee, especially since it was very sweet and thick very rich . The BF was way to full to help me eat it, so sadly, a lot of it was left behind. n nATMOSPHERE nLoved, loved, loved the dark warm cozy feel! The antler chandeliers were a nice touch as well n nPRICE nI would say expenisive, or at least the way I ate! But then again, I didn't get the chance to participate in HH. I suggest that if you plan to do the HH, you get there at 4 p.m. when the RF opens and when HH starts ",2
"Since I grew up in La, I'll go ahead and consider myself an expert in judging the authenticity of the cuisine. After so many bad experiences with restaurants that serve ""real "" Cajun food, it is great to find one that really does! Lola's is as real as it gets. I had the bronze catfish and grits, outstanding, and followed it up with a nice warm piece of sweet potato pecan pie, equally good. Prices were right and the service was spot on. I HIGHLY recommend Lola's!",2

"This review is for those who are VIP hosted gamers. I'm not going to ramble on about the casino since it's pretty decent. But if you are a high roller player DO NOT stay at this casino. Trying to get a hold of your supposed casino host was a complete nightmare. But they have no problem sending you welcoming letters, casino events, casino stay specials to reel you on. Yet when you try contacting them they are no where to be found. And what's worse is when you finally hunt them down, they don't care to help you out. But what happened to the nice host who sent me that letter claiming to help me with whatever I need? It's complete BS. DO NOT STAY HERE.",1
"When I think about American Solar, I think about a company that did everything they promised when it came to installing our solar panels, and they did it in a timely fashion. They kept us informed throughout the entire process, and were quick to get back to us with any subsequent questions. Best of all, our solar panels are producing about 20 more power than what we were quoted, so our system is expected to actually produce more energy than we consume throughout a given year! We're extremely satisfied with the work of American Solar and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone interested in solar energy. n nUpdate A year after installation, these panels did produce just under 20 MORE THAN what we were guaranteed, and we're more than satisfied with how the whole process played out. Solar power is a GREAT investment in cleaner energy, and for your wallet as well. Thank You, American Solar!",2
Traditional sushi menu. Nice place inside.,2
"Decided to try this one again after 6 months. Bad mistake. n nI went through the drive thru yesterday and ordered a 16 piece family meal. Extra crispy. ""Sorry sir. All we have is white meat in extra crispy so would you like to pay the extra for it? "" Huh? How is that my problem that you are low on inventory? My other option was to wait 8 minutes at the drive thru for the chicken to be done so I gave up and got half original half crispy. n nThen at the window I see a notice that I'll be charged an extra 0.35 for using a debit card. I didn't think anything of it since I was charging it, not using debit.hence the visa logo. Low and behold they tacked the extra charge on it anyway. I called visa and they asked for the address so they could look into their merchant account. nafter that I got home and noticed that my side of sweet corn was missing.even after asking the person at the window if everything was in there. nSigh. n nWent back to the store to get my corn and the counter girl asked me if i was in today or yesterday. Showed her my receipt, listened to her tell the line team they forgot another item, then she gave it to me and apologized. Nice to get an apology but after coming back after getting home it would have been a nice gesture to offer something extra. n nGot back home and noticed that there were no butter or honey with the order either. At this point I gave up. n nFood was ok but nothing special. By the time I actually got to eat it the crispy and regular tasted about the same. Guess I'll try again in another 6 12 months. Place really sucks.",1
"The original bacon bar. This is where it all began. So from the outside you can barely tell that it's a candy shop. That's how chic the decor is. n nLet me begin by telling you that they love to add hot peppers and weird spices to their candy and i love candy so I'm willing to give it a shot. n nIf you ask they'll give you samples of there most popular weird treats. Their famous bacon chocolate bar is really good, crunchy, and a hint of smoky. I really liked their old fashion toffee. There's also a different kind where they added red hot peppers into the mix. Not really my type. Their truffles are very exquisite. I'm in love with The Wink of a Rabbit. So smooth and I do love my white chocolate n nThe staff is very friendly here. One of the bartistas were making hot chocolate and they offered it to us for free so of course my brother and I tried it. First sip delicious. 5 seconds later ""holy crap! It's spicy! "" ""what a sick joke man "". If only they didn't stir the hot chocolate with a supersized Big Red gum stick. n nThe prices is really up there but this isn't sn ordinary Godiva or See's so it shouldn't hurt to try new things and be adventurous.",2
They always serve the absolute best new england clam chowder i've ever had. It's fantastic. I stay at Rio but always journey to the strip just to have a bowl of this stuff.,2
I tried pumping gas at one of the pumps and the machine was malfunctioning. I notified the attendant who at first blew me off then when I insisted that the machine be reset so that no one could get free gas on my card told me to wait 5 10 mins then it will reset. When I told her I don't want any purchases on my card that I didn't make so if it happens I will let them know she starts yelling at me saying she is not responsible for any extra purchases made on my card and that maybe now on I should go to a different gas station for my gas. This was extremely embarrassing because she is yelling and other patrons are staring at us at this point. When I walk away she then continues to complain about me and showing other customers that the machines work! By far the worst experience I have ever had at a gas station. If I could leave zero stars that would be my true rating.,1
Been there twice now and had the falafel dinner both times and both times they were made very well.the flavor is above average when I compare to other falafel I've had. My wife had lentils the most recent time and she loved them and she is pretty picky about lentils. The price is abit inflated but the experiences thus far haven't detered me from worrying about that.,2

"This may be the longest Yelp review in the history of written form, so I apologize. It's worth reading. Please share. n nAfter my last experience, Louis, the founder owner of WIldflower contacted me about my review. He didn't pull an Amy's Baking on me. He was very kind, caring, and asked me very specific questions about what happened last time. We even spoke on the phone and had a lengthy conversation about it. n nIt was very nice to get to know him, and understand his passion for good food, and great service. We also talked about some of Wildflower's charitable work with some non profit groups like Komen. n n He was very concerned about my bad experience, and wanted to make things right. Not just by giving me my money back, but by fixing what was wrong. n nBy the end of our conversation, I offered to come back to the restaurant on my own dime, with no expectations for my money back. I told him that I did appreciate the kind gesture. n nA week later, in the mail, I received a refund, a gift card for one meal, AND a receipt for a very generous donation to the Komen foundation. Earlier, I had told him about a friend who was a breast cancer survivor. I was moved by this donation. n nToday, I went back to Wildflower, and used my gift card. So in full disclosure, I write this review. n nI ordered the a sandwich with roasted sweet potato, fresh mozzarella, fig confit, tomato, arugula, marinated fennel and Balsamic Vinaigrette on Herb Focaccia. It was like heaven on a plate. n nThe mozza and fig confit was the pairing that is a match made in heaven. Think Stockton and Malone. Jordan and Pippen. Jay Z and Beyonce. Donny and Marie. Yeah. That freaking amazing. n nThe Focaccia was pillowy soft and a delight. I want more. n nOn the side, I had the passion mango slaw. It was simply.great. n nThis was one of the rare occasions that I enjoyed a sandwich without ordering meat. I was shocked, but I was feeling adventurous. n nI am really sad about leaving Scottsdale, because this is one place I honestly could see myself visiting weekly. n nLast time, I complained about the long wait. Perhaps it's due to the high quality. I'm not sure what happened last time. Maybe it was an off morning. Read all the other reviews. They are fairly consistent. n nI am very happy with my return to Wildflower. I am very glad I gave it another shot. n nLouis, you are a great businessman, and your breadheads are fantastic people. n nWhen I come back to visit Scottsdale, I will pay you a visit.",2
"5 Stars hands down. Service, food and attention to detail from our waiter made me a happy customer. This place is a gem in north Scottsdale and if you find yourself in the area craving a burger do not think twice to consider stopping here. n nThe fire chips were amazing as an appetizer and the burger was well made. Cooked to my liking and prepared in time for my taste buds. The blue moon I ordered on tap was a bit flat, but that wasn't a problem for our waiter to quickly switch out the kegs and bring me a new pint from the tap. I know I'll be coming back for more of the menu. I ended the dinner with a peanut butter shake and it didn't disappoint at all. Great place, great atmosphere and great food.",2
"Went a Thursday night with a friend, was the last night for our groupon coupon. I don't even know where to start. The restaurant seems to be very confused what tapas. Being server raw veggies and some sort of sour cream dip IS NOT a tapas! Something so amateurish to serve. That last dish some potato cake that I guess is suppose to be a spin on a Spanish torta, was cold, mushy and left the worst after taste. My friend left with such a bad case of heartburn, they use canned tomatoes for all their dishes and out of the 11 tapas there must have been 7! nHowever the service was great! Our waitress was amazing, super attentive.",1
"Can't say enough good things about Four Peaks. Out of the several locations they have in the valley, this is my favorite. n nI've tried a few of the different burgers they have here and the enchiladas, nothing disappoints. There's a lot more to the menu than just burgers though so more options if a burger isn't your craving. The menu has recommendations for pairing their beers with certain meals too. The beers are always great here. n nIt's almost guaranteed that the place will look packed no matter what time of day you come by, but it's huge on the inside and has tons of seating. Never actually had to wait for a table yet in all the visits I've had at this place.",2
I tried to call in an order and was left on hold for over 15 mins. I finally just hung up.,1
"Sandwich was amazing. the line was long but, YUM. I will totally be back for more",2
"Not impressed thus far and I didn't even get to try their food. n nIt's the 21st century.get with the program people.update your website, Open Table and Yelp. I'm pretty sure it's not that difficult to change the time from 10 am to 11 30am. We got there a little bit early but since we saw that they opened at 10 am we figured it would be ok to be early for our 11 am reservation. We ended up walking around until 11 because it didn't look open at ""10 50 am. "" We were excited when we heard the clock chime 11 times so we hurriedly walked over to Poppy Den. Some other lady was talking to what looked like the manager but long story short the story the manager gave me was that they are going through changes and have not had a chance to update anything. In any case I couldn't wait another 30 minutes.I was starving! We never get to go out without the baby and this was our chance so we left disappointed and me a bit angry. n nWill I give Poppy Den another chance? Perhaps, but their food better be amazing when I go. My husband told me there's nothing like a hungry woman scorned. Ain't that the truth?",1
"The food is solid and the people are generally quite friendly. It's like a local Las Vegas based version of Chipotle, but with seafood options. I generally go in when I have complete disregard for my cholesterol and order up 3 shrimp tacos loaded with rice, potato, sour cream, chipotle ranch, and cheese. Try 'em up that way and you'll be in what Guy Fieri calls ""Flavortown "". n nJust kidding. You'll still be in Henderson. But the tacos are delicious.",2
"So sad. This location is excellent. The food is above average. The decor is lovely. The service.ugh. Why? Why? Why? It's so easy to fix?!? SMILE a little! Even my teen age sons said that our server didn't look like he enjoyed his job very much. Couldn't get refills on coffee to save my life. I admit, it was brunch.so coffee is a crazy request! He really missed out too. I'm a 50 tipper if the service is at least fair as I understand everyone has a bad day. But NOBODY was smiling. Everyone looked miserable. And if your servers are miserable, that means your management is miserable. And if your management is miserable, than I certainly don't want to add to the funds of an owner that makes people miserable. Will give it another go, as I try to give everyone a 2nd chance, have even experienced a couple of turn arounds.but man it could be such a warm, successful, happy place. sigh ",1

"I don't care how busy your day is or how tired you are. this is a store.

"worst value for your money. went on a saturday evening. 5pm.has alot of options, and it looked delicious, but was i wrong. food was bland, dried orange chichen was like jerky non of the soups had flavor. im being honest all their soups tasted bad, more like tap flavor. i love asian soups, these soups were horrible.for a saturday evening it was very dissapointed. with taxes it came out to be 16 and some change withna fountain drink. i know i paid what i could have paid for a sit down asian bistro the waitress were super friendly, but at the end you gomfor the food. end line save your money, for 2 you are paying 32, and if u have kids well over 40. nothing is worth it here.",1

"I was excited to try Merci, as I've heard read great reviews. n nWent for lunch on a Wednesday with a friend. We met at noon, and there were probably about five other tables sitting down eating when we arrived. We were greeted warmly and told to sit where we liked. n nOur server quickly stopped by was polite. We both ordered an open face sandwich, and my friend ordered a bowl of asparagus soup she was excited to know that it was vegan made fresh. n nIt was at this point that our experience turned from being great to 'meh'. We waited for nearly 45 mins to get our sandwiches. Someone not our server did stop by and let us know that our orders were under way apologized for the wait. When our sandwiches finally came, my friend asked about her soup and was told it would be out shortly. She then asked to cancel the order, as she really didn't think she'd have room to try it after the sandwich. Why they didn't think to bring it out during the previous 45 minutes we were waiting is beyond me. n nAbout five minutes later we called our server over and asked how long their crepes took to make. I'm 7 months pregnant, and once I saw that they had Nutella Crepes on the menu, it was really all I could think about. She said about 10 minutes so I asked her to put an order in worried that it would take far longer, judging how long the sandwiches took. n nShe came out to our table a short time later and informed us that they were all out of crepes. But they had ice cream, should I want that. I am by no means an expert or even remotely experienced with running a restaurant, but how do you run out of crepes? I have made them before you put a few ingredients together then cook them on the stove. AND there is a grocery store in the same complex, so if you had run out of, let's say, eggs couldn't you go buy some? I know I'm pregnant and not really that patient when it comes to craving, but come on. n nThe food we did get to eat was good. The people who work there were friendly, but I was by no means 'wowed' enough to plan a trip back.",1

"RE Sammy Hagars Birthday Bash on 10 18 2014 nI thought VIP meant Very Important Persons? We Paid 225 a piece far in advance for VIP ""Lounge "" tickets. Still had to wait forever in GA Line.why? We paid extra for supposedly less headache, right? The website had a bunch of promises that werent entirely true. The promised couches? Yeah there were couches. 4 in all,so of course, they were already taken and pulled up to the balcony railing taking up the very limited and miniscule viewing space . What about the ""VIP Cabana "" area that wasnt listed on the website? Nevermind that was just as crappy as the ""VIP Lounge "" area Just Rocko Moose guarding the velvet rope seperating the areas Our Private bar was a huge disappoiment. 30 for two nasty beers only 2 varieties on tap served in small plastic cups and a half shot oh and lets not forget about the 5 water. There were only 2 bartenders who must have been hired from the Home Depot parking lot for the event because they were very slow, inept and unfriendly. We did find out later that we could have spent another 100 for two bracelets that would allow us to drink free for the rest of the night.but why when you cant even get the drink you prefer or see the show? The private bathrooms? Give me a break the bathrooms were just closer to our ""VIP "" area. We couldn't see Sammy the stage or the wide screens, but we could see the volleyball players very clearly. We had the WORST area possible for all the money we spent. The people who spent 85 got seating and a great view of the stage. I wish we would have gone that route it would have been great. As it was.We left. All my Baby got for his 50th Birthday was two VIP lanyards to prove we were there and the view of the back of some guys head.

"I know. it's Target, but it's got pretty much everything you need short of a butcher shop and babysitters. Staff is very helpful. it also houses the closest Starbucks to my home. Since we're talking about 2 miles, that's a bit sad, but oh well.",2
"Ok, resort did isn't generally all that good. This place was perhaps even better than most in terms of food quality. The service was perhaps the slowest and worst I have ever experienced. Almost two hours for a bunch of burgers.my advice, pick the other restaurant.",1
"I got the stir fry vegetables with brown sauce, brown rice and avocado ice cream. The veg and rice were great with the brown sauce, the avocado ice cream is an acquired taste.

"Nicely designed casino, but comparatively smaller than most of the casinos on the Strip. Since it is so far away, I kind of expected them to keep me here but I couldn't wait to leave. Slots seem to be old with not the newer games. Table games were cheap but limited. Only a one table of my favorites opened. Most of all, the decibel level were so high I couldn't hear myself think. Ridiculous. In fact, idiotic. I guess young people like the music loud, but really, I needed to yell to talk to anyone. Plus it was rap and other crappy music.

"Bring back Coco! A friend picked this place for his birthday dinner last week. It was a Monday so it was pretty dead. My other friend got there 1st and got us a table, i walked inside to let them know my reservation name. Everyone was sitting at the bar and turned and looked at me like I disturbed them. n nBefore I got there my friend ordered me a cosmo, took a while to get there for only have 3 customers. It tasted okay so that is the 2 stars. My friends sangria was disgusting and was spiced with something awful, they did not charge us for it. He then went to look over the wine list, as the manager just stood there and stared at him waiting for his reply. Super uncomfortable, it wasn't like we were in a rush! n nWe ordered the cod fritters and 2 cheeses to start. I didn't care for any of it, the presentation was bad and the flavor was worse. We figured we were in for a night of disappointments if we stayed, so we opted to pay the check and head somewhere else. n nI was really hoping for some great Spanish tapas since they are few and far between here. But it just was bad and awkward and made me question how the same people who own and run Luce could possibly be involved with this place.",1
"Ive been to Zine twice now and it was two times to many. The serviced is good and its a great looking place, but thats were the compliments stop. The food is just average and you can get the same quality in any major city for a third of the price. All of that would have been ok with me if not for the ambience, because this place has none. There is no music what soever and you can totally here everyones conversation from across the entire restaurant. I went with a group of six on a friday at 8pm and you would of thought that there was some sort of seniors only early bird special going on. When I go to a supposedly cool asian restaurant in vegas on a friday night, it better be lively. I walked in and instantly felt awkward because of the dead silence in this place. This place needs to be run by somebody else or close shop and make it something different",1
"If there was ever a way to describe how food tastes and or where the chef gets their food Streets of New York is not shy about it. After all they did name the restaurant Streets of New York which is what their food tastes like because I'm sure that's where they scraped it from. If they read this review maybe they'll change the restaurant name to Streaks of My Pants. n nI'd give less stars is possible. We've ordered from Streets a few times and each time the delivery was a little longer than expected. Each time we ordered we just thought ""maybe they're really busy or they're having an off night. "" No. they just suck. The first time we called in an order they told us to call a different Streets because they don't send drivers to our neighborhood. I explained that we were actually closer to their location than the one they recommended and the girl hung up. Found out that we can order online and just figured how can they f ck that up? Well don't know how, but they did. Pizza was under cooked. Things were on the pizza that we specifically marked to not be on the pizza. n On a side note, I've seen their delivery drivers in our neighborhood while out walking the dog and they drive like goddamn maniacs. Small neighborhood with short winding streets and sidewalks with cars parked tightly on them and children running about and here comes the Streets delivery driver at 60 mph careening around a corner almost killing a child and still doesn't hit the breaks. So if you decide to order some Streets after reading this, tell the driver to slow down a bit. Killing someone's dog isn't worth your sh tty food. n nOk so my wife and I agreed to never deal with Streets ever again. Her sister calls and says hey you wanna meet at Streets for dinner. I'm not paying so we agree to go. First bad sign, the parking lot is completely vacant apart from her sister's car. Second bad sign, we walk in and the whole place smells like a sewer line burst. The smell was so bad my wife almost vomited on our way to the table. The waitress brought us our drinks and took our orders. Three sandwiches and a salad took all of 35 minutes to cook. I choked down my sandwich and immediately felt sick. Similar to having broken bottles in my gut. My wife's sister paid with her credit card. The waitress took the card and was gone for about 15 minutes. Mind you there are only three other tables in the whole place. I eventually left the table to evacuate my bowls. Funny thing about the bathroom is that the door to the toilet stall doesn't really close and the toilet isn't bolted down. We sped home where my wife promptly locked herself away in a bathroom and I in another. It's 10 00 pm. This all happened at 6 pm. I'm still wishing I were dead and I may miss work tomorrow. I still have the smell of the sewer flavored restaurant in my nose. n nPapa Johns' and Dominos' have never messed up an order for me, are always fast, friendly, fairly priced and have never made me sick.",1
This company did a terrible job. They come once a week spend about 3 to 4 minutes and charge ridiculous amount of money they would constantly leave the gate to the pool open they would never sweep the sides of the pool after numerous complaints we had to terminate service they are a total waste of time and money do not give them your cell phone number unless you want a ridiculous amount of texts they are just bad news.,1
"Stay away! Many billing issues front office is not customer helpful. You must keep track of your own balances and insurance. They will not help. I was even billed for services they never did, but even with copies of my walk out statements as proof, they state they can bill per the estimates and do not have to prove they did the work via the walk out statements.",1
I got house chips with my sandwich. I thought house chips are cooked in restaurant. I received store bought ruffle chips in a plastic sandwich bag. Lol,1
Off the strip and reasonably priced. Friendly wait staff. The saketinis and avocado train are must haves! Absolutely delicious.,2
"This is a nice welcome change to the choices of restaurants for the Downtown Phoenix ASU campus. n nI've been quite a few times during busy times during lunch and off times such as 2 3 pm. n nI've had the bagel sandwich, Del Rio, a couple of salads, and the rice bowl. All have been pretty good. The Del Rio sandwich sometimes has lacked all the ingredients listed on the menu. The bagel sandwich one bagel with hummus and the other with guacamole is huge. It is not good leftover though. The rice bowl has an interesting taste and is pretty filling. I've ordered side vegetables which are tasty. n nThe baked goods have been hit or miss. The dark chocolate cookie looked good but had no flavor whatsoever. The carrot cake cookie sandwich was very good though. n nThe service is sometimes good, sometimes really rude. The cashiers are sometimes rude. Sometimes they are nice. The last few times I went, the cashiers act like I'm annoying them by just being there and ordering food. Almost every time I've been, something has been left off my order. The last time something was missing, the guy brought it and just slammed it down on the table. Thanks!",2
Did they change owners or recipes? This place has been a long time staple for our office lunches for about four years now. It's usually exceptional but the last two visits we were surprised that the food was not as good. The chicken quesadilla which is usually excellent did not have grilled chicken as usual. It was sliced from what tasted like a roast chicken. The avocado was blackened and you now have to ask for the avocado crema which used to be included. Even the salsa tastes different. Bring the tried and true back an we will return ,1
"Very reasonably priced, comfortable sofas and sectionals. They had a good selection of beds to choose from as well. I was the only person in the store and the 2 salesmen knew I was there, but didn't even say hello or bother to ask if I needed anything. Instead, they felt it was better to talk on their cell phones and sit around. I guess they didn't need my business!",1
"After a raid of Hyatt's Regency Lounge hor'devers and business call, a group of us headed over to nearby Garduno's to try the local scene with the expectation of having a light dinner. The only option of ""light "" at Garduno's was to make something of the appetizers. if we only had stuck with our trusty SWB's restaurant at the Hyatt amazing! n nThe unananimous consensus was that the food sucked. I mean really sucked. The attempt at making fresh guac' was pitiful. Heck, one of our compatriates was trying to add salsa to it to add a little more flavor to it. The quesadilla's were aweful too. The bowl of queso not worth it one bit. And the nachos were dismal. I would venture to say that if you pulled around the back, you'd probably see a Kraft truck dropping some Velveeta! Actually that would be a step up for these cats. n nAs for the drinks we all tried it out and were dissapointed with them too. One thing they do make their drinks strong. But that's not all to a good margarita. n nVenture at your own risk. actually, just stay away.",1
"Not the best mexican restaurant. The food was very bland and a little bit over priced for what it really was. I ordered pollo fundido which is pretty good, but they served it with slices of american cheese on top, which is not how pollo fundido is supposed to be served. I would not recommend this mexican restaurant if you are looking for authentic mexican food.",1
"I have to write a second review as this place second time around impressed me again! I had reserved a table for a party of 6 and become one of those customers I hated, having to call and ask if we could be late. They were absolutely fine with it and when we did arrived they showed us to a private little alcove with a long table. It was far to big for 6, and inspired, I asked if a few more friends could join. Also doing something a customer never should! And they were completely fine with it. The service was fantastic and the food just as amazing as the last time. We had quite a rolling dinner between 6 of us and we tried so many yummy things. Again, the eggplant was a winner as was the dragon roll and the Kanpai special roll. I have to compliment them on how accommodating they were despite us being naughty dinner guests. It is a wonderful place to take a larger party and a completely fun dining experience!",2
"an AMAZING show! n ngreat music speakers on every seat and in front of you ! great for everyone, whether youre a beatles fan or not but c'mon how could you not be?! There is so much to see. Visuals up, down, below, everywhere along with a great cast and great music, you cannot go wrong. You will be surprised and in awe.guaranteed! Such a feel good performance. n nOh yes, and not a bad seat in the house. And yes, I was all the way at the top! n nCreative genius. A must see in vegas!",2
"A nice meal and a nice evening out. Ventured over to the westside for dinner. Thought it may be crowded due to the all city swim meet at Nakoma, but we got right in and found a comfortable booth. I enjoyed a variety of their taps. Summer, so a weissbier and of course an IPA. nFor dinner, i kept my burger streak going and had the mushroom, gorgonzola cheese burger. Messy and delicious. I didn't read the menu very closely and was surprised when not asked about fries, chips etc. So, was very surprised to not get any. nShe had the chicken picatta, and loved it! The lemon caper garlic sauce on top of the breaded chicken was oohed on. The potatos completed a delicious serving. We finished, thought about dessert, and so went with the cheese curds. They were pretty good. Lightly battered and even better without the sauce. We'd visit again.",2
"No. Or rather, Fuck no. n nOur experience was by far the worst I have ever had, anywhere. Let's start with once you enter There are no signs to indicate whether you should seat yourself, or order first, or what the hell ever you are suppose to do. And employees are the least helpful human beings on earth. They stare at you while you look around obviously lost as to what to do. n nSo we sat down by a wall of pizza boxes, and found a menu left there by previous customers. We decided on the special, a 16inch cheese pie for 9.99 . Nice right? Fuck no. With 2 per drink and a time of ten minutes for the pie we waited. And waited. And then the unthinkable happens. A group of three kids and an adult drop the rest of their pizza on the ground. How the hell that happened, I do not know, but the end result was three left over pieces on the ground. n nTwo minutes later these fuckers get OUR FUCKING PIZZA. The employee says, ""Oh that' ok, we will get you another. "" Yeah, another person's fucking pizza they have been waiting for! Ar you FUCKING KIDDING ME!? Oh and no explaination when we get one HALF AN HOUR AFTER ORDERING! Ten minutes my ass. n nWhatever, you may say, why freak out? I am freaking out because when I asked for a to go box, I was given a USED one! IT HAD GREASE MARKS AND CRUMBS IN IT! n nSo my friend threw it on the table next to us, grabbed a clean one from the tower behind me, and we left. n nThis place is a complete and utter mess, not to mention the pizza was less than good and even ended up getting me sick. Never again.",1
"Totally disappointed! Ordered the fresh strawberry shake they used strawberry syrup. When we asked about it they told us ""oh sorry, we ran out "". The banana split had 1 2 of a banana, vanilla soft serve, chocolate butterscotch syrup. Oh yeah, the were out of strawberries. n nPortions are huge but if the order accuracy sucks what's the use? n nStay away until they eliminate the bait switch!",1
"OK massage. Not very relaxing atmosphere. I could hear the music in the room next to me ans the toilet flushing three rooms away, also, the staff kept walking by the door chatting. Also, I hate being pressures into memberships. they give an OK massage if you don't mind all the noise or pressure to sign up.",1
"This place has to be what Buffalo Wild Wings was like in the 1990's. I've never seen so many CRT TV's in one spot in my entire life! I recently stopped by to watch the Suns successfully spank the despised Spurs in the first game of the playoffs, so that alone may add a star to this review. n nOnce you get past the fact the initial shock of how many TV's there are, the beauty of this place really sets in. Each Table along the edge has it's own old school big screen that as mentioned, is 98 likely to be tuned into sports awesome! n n25 oz beers were under 4 and really hit the spot word to the wise though, don't order a 12 oz right afterwards because when you put the two next to each other, the 12 ozer will make you look super wimpy. n nFood was great too the pizza was some of the best I've had in a bar, and really revived my appreciation for the classic beer pizza combo! n nAll in all great place to catch a game any game! and some beer with food that goes good with beer!",2
"I was disappointed with the service I got at this Cracker Barrel. While it was quick, it wasn't all that friendly. I ordered the plate that included biscuits, fried apples, and hasbrown casserole, and I added a side of grits to it. My boyfriend and his dad heard me order it, but apparently, the waitress didn't. She quickly disappeared after she brought out our food, so I didn't have the chance to ask about my grits then. She never checked back with us, so I kind of flagged her down near the end of our meal as she passed by our table. I told her I had ordered a side of grits, but I never received it. She glared at me and made kind of a grumble noise. She did bring some grits out a few minutes later, but she didn't smile or say anything. n nThe apples were absolutely delicious. The grits were bland I remember them being much better at another Cracker Barrel location , and part of my hashbrown casserole was burnt. The part that wasn't burnt was really good, though. The biscuits were cold, and they didn't taste fresh. I was disappointed that my biscuits didn't come with gravy, but maybe they only come with gravy when you order the big breakfast deals? I dunno. But my boyfriend let me have some of his gravy, and it, too, was cold. And it wasn't thick and creamy like I've had it at other Cracker Barrel restaurants. n nMaybe this location was just having an off day? Fortunately, my first experience with Cracker Barrel was an extremely good one both food and service wise , so I'm not going to say that I'll never come back to this chain due to this one experience. But I can honestly say that my experience at this location doesn't measure up nearly as high as my experiences at other Cracker Barrel restaurants one of which I would have given five stars to had I been a Yelper at the time .",1
4 words.don't waste your time. The menu limited. Food not flavorful. Workers ungrateful.,1
The idea is great but I recently purchased some at the foodie fest. To start 5.00 dollars a cupcake is overpriced. The packaging was terrible and I was unable to get the cupcake out without it tipping over and messing up the frosting. The first cupcake actually crumbled and fell apart on the ground. The taste was bland and noting to write home about. The creme filling was too heavy which causes the cupcake to fall apart. There was hardly any frosting and visually boring. I don't see this business getting any farther from the truck.,1
For what it is it's expensive. Not that it's not good. Just over price. Not to mention there is a KFC right down the street. The place is clean and it's a great location to have a chicken place. The service is what you would expect from a fast food. Also I think the portion size could be a little bigger once again overpriced . So with out being more repetitive I'm done.,1
"Unless I missed something today, this place appears to be closed. I was looking for enchiladas in this area and it's close to home but had never been before. Was I in the right place?",1
Went for a poetry reading this unassuming little place is a perfect place for bookworms to escape for some great coffee and a vast selection of used books!,2
"The more I come here, the more I love it. Similar to Kazu, this restaurant pub serves great Japanese delicacies that do not include your typical sushi. My favorite dishes are the takoyaki, karaage, and ebimayo, among others like the usual shrimp tempura and dumplings. However, I'd rather order the first 3 and just stick to those along with a few drinks! You get a few small plates, share them with another person and you're good for the night! Also, if you like sake bombs I definitely recommend getting those large ones for the more daring . They make it such an enjoyable experience, with plenty of chanting and cheering for everyone to have a good time! It's a lively and rowdy place, unlike Kazu, but it's part of the experience and what makes it a great alternative. It's bigger, but usually needs reservations, especially since the weekends easily get jampacked! n nHope you enjoy it as much as I do did ",2
"This is a great shop in Shadyside with a little something for everyone. It has lots of statuary, candles, and free trade items. The second floor is simply filled with books on all sorts of subjects. They seem to specialize in recovery from addiction, abuse, etc., but they also have an even larger collection of self help and metaphysical subjects. It's a nice local store to support when you're in the area.",2
"If you have no particular show that you want to see. COME TO TIX4TONIGHT booth! They have DISCOUNT tickets for variety shows! n nThey open at 10am. Come early to avoid long line. Not all the shows are HALF OFF price but still nice to receive 20 30 off. n nThey don't assign the seat numbers so you have to bring their tickets to the theater and exchange for the official tickets. FIRST COME FIRST SERVE! The earlier you exchange the tickets, the better seats you can choose.",2
"Legit pho and awesome grilled porkchops. Not sure how my family found this place, but I am glad they did. After rolling by a ton of places lit up with fancy signs and neon lights, pulled up to this restaurant not expecting much. How wrong was I.",2
"Cool dive bar setting. Great service. The burnt ends were the best I've ever had, but I have had better sauce.",2
The pool is salt water so you don't spend a week washing chlorine out of your hair! The rooms was extremely clean and the view was spectacular. We had a room overlooking the pool and the Strip and the view at night was amazing! I will definitely stay here next time I go to Vegas!,2
I ordered the Chinese orange chicken lunch special with fried rice and house dressing on my salad. The dressing was really good! Taste like coconut! The orange sauce for the chicken was very orange tasting. The fried rice was flavorful.,2
"The Blake is like an old pair of shoes inside a new shoe box. n nThe paint is new. The carpet is new. The elevators are old. The phone in my room didn't work. The ice is on 3 floors of 16. The furniture is new and cool looking, if rather cheap. There is a flat screen TV. But it doesn't get any channels. There is a wifi signal but I can't seem to connect to it. There is an iPod dock, thank gawd. n nI will say this it is a hotel. Not awful. But avoid it if you can.",1
Pretty good food. Cool place to see. Went because of Bizarre Foods America,2
"Wife and I were in Madison for a wedding and there was some below average temperatures for early May. Temperature was in the low 40s and my wife forgot to pack her coat for the trip. Hmmm. forgot or just wanted another jacket to add to the collection? Whatever the reason we were not going to be able to bar hop with no jacket in the rainy cold. Walking around town we had a hard time finding a place that had anything that was trendy and not extremely overpriced. n nComing across Ragstock was a blessing. The place is like a thrift store and a TJ Max collided and this was the result. The clothes were trendy and hip with good prices. This is not clothes most people would wear to the office but would wear out on the town, to a party, or just anywhere that's casual. We spent over an hour in the store and walked out with much more than we intended. She ended up getting 2 jackets and a shirt and I got 2 t shirts and a pair of shorts. I suggest you stop in just to take a look around. We saw college kids buying clothes for a costume party and others shopping for a dinner night out on the town. Very unique!",2
"Horrible! don't go to this McDonald's . I asked if I could please have fresh French fries because they had been setting for a long time Manager said they were fresh . when I disagreed he said I was wrong and the fries were fine. n nnothing I ordered was fresh , not sure if this McDonalds it pinching pennies , they seem to always be busy . I will not go back ever!",1
"I love the beer selection and the layout of the place. I suppose it's a bit pricey, but it doesn't bother me too much after living in Vegas and Chicago. n nThe biggest problem is the service. I've been there twice the first time the place was empty and the service was adequate, the second time the place was busy and the service was non existant. I would have expected to go through 4 beers in the time I was there, and only got one because we couldn't find the waitress. n nI'd expect a bar like this to be well staffed on game days, and I'm not sure exactly what was taking them so long seeing as they don't serve food. It would be very difficult to convince me to go back, which is depressing since I've been looking for a bar in the area with this kind of selection.",1
"I didn't have high hopes for this place based off the cafe in this casino but I was extremely surprised by how amazing the food was at this Mexican restaurant. First, we ordered a pitcher of cadillac margaritas which was great to see on the menu. Then we ordered a couple variations of the street tacos, all were good, the mushroom enchiladas and the shrimp and crab enchiladas, both of which were absolutely amazing and had the creamiest delicious sauce, yum! Even the salsa served before our meal was incredible. The service was great and the food was reasonably priced, we will be back here for sure! n nSo we came back for a second try and iPad to change my rating to only 2 stars. From the beginning things were a bit off. We asked for a booth and the hostess took us into the restaurant, there was an open booth being cleaned and she said that we would have to wait 10 minutes. Um, why!?! So 10 minutes later we are seated in that exact booth that was being cleaned. Okay, let's get some food. I ordered the mushroom enchiladas and seafood enchiladas that I ordered last time. Let's just say the chef had to have been someone different from last time or extremely hungover. There was no love in this food. There was minimal sauce last time there was a lot and both enchiladas just tasted bland, little flavor. There was such little sauce that I asked for a side of sour cream which the meal comes with and was told there would be an up charge. Lovely. The carne asada street taco for 2 was better than anything on my plate. All in all, not sure if I will give this place another chance as the food was absolutely boring.",1
"We were invited to lunch with friends from Germany and I offered to bring dessert. The wife mentioned that her husband loved apple strudel which is not something I've ever made . Luckily, this bakery makes excellent strudel! I bought enough slices of apple strudel for the lunch, and also some Poppy seed Coffee Cake as a special treat for my fiance. Everything was wonderful! I only wish they had the yogurt or bee sting cake available that day. I would have loved to try them. We will definitely be stopping here more often, especially when we have guests from Germany.",2
My friend and I spent all weekend excited about going to the famous Serendipity before we left Vegas. We waited close to an hour and sat on on a table that had been open the entire time we were waiting and asked them 30 minutes before if we could just sit on that table. The staff were very unfriendly and slow and the food was not worth the wait. I hope the one in NY lives up to the name because Vegas does not.,1
"I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good. n nThey have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. n nIt is a sports themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. n nThe biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders SEVEN! and had to quit. nTheir fries are very good. And so are the wings. n nI'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it.",1
"I've been here twice, once to dine in and tonight I ordered to go. The first time around I ordered the guacamole burger. It was delicious! While we waited for our food they brought out a sampling of their homemade BBQ chips also delicious and appreciated. My friend ordered the same thing, but was disappointed in the size of the patty in proportion to the bun. I didn't mind. The burger and toppings to bun ratio worked just fine for me. If there had been more meat, I probably would have needed more guac to compensate. Just saying. n nTonight, I ordered the Seoul burger. After an incredibly long day at work, it was amazing. Though, I was searching for the bulgogi sauce. I'm not so sure it made it onto my burger. This time I definitely noticed the petite ness of the patty. I would say that the bun extended over the beef patty by about an inch. It is a pretty great bun, by the way. Even with the beef deficit, it was tasty. I will order it again. Like others have said, you kind of need to order a double. A single is probably only 1 2 of what you want out of a good burger and also kind of a tease. The bang bang sauce is dope. It's like 1000 island's cousin, but really, who cares? Eat it. You'll like it. n nI don't have much to say about their decor or the physical layout. It's fine, nothing particularly special or memorable. I don't know about you, but I go to restaurants to eat. So, unless a restaurant has a sanitation issue, I couldn't care less about how it looks. Both times, the staff have been friendly and super helpful.",2
"I bought a house in foreclosure which had a very ugly front yard. I found Z Best Turf online, called them, and Rob showed up the same day to give me a quote. I liked the price and decided to go ahead and hire him. I had to go through some hurdles with the Summerlin HOA, but he helped significantly. They do awesome work, I had artificial turf installed in my front yard and courtyard. Would recommend.",2
"God awful service n1. They got my order wrong, then they argued with me when I tried to correct them. n2. It tasted awful. n3. I still had to pay for it. n4. I ended up getting sick and barfing it all out. n nI ain't going back to that death trap.",1
"Worst experience I ever had. I was making my order and she totaled it before I was done. Ummm no! Look here, learn how to listen and take orders. She said she couldn't hear me but I was already pretty much yelling into the speaker box. train your employees better!",1
"I took my wife here for her birthday this weekend. Lemme say, the service does not get any better than at this place. Our drinks never stayed empty, and our napkins were always quick to be folded by staff whenever we left the table. n nMy wife's bone in filet just melted in your mouth. My bone in ribeye steak was cooked to perfection, and was super tender. n nThe food was out of this world great! True, you're paying an arm and a leg for it, but I felt like I got my money's worth. I'm definitely returning when I visit Vegas.",2
I love it here. Very dark and super sharp lounge. It's definitely a late night place so I don't suggest going here for happy hour. If you're in the mood for a snack make sure you get the chicken lollipops. Yum!,2
"The happy hour at Sierra Gold is what makes this place worth the outting. n nSierra Gold can best be describes as a high end PT's and it really is. PT's own all of the Sierra Golds I think there are a total of 3 of 4 in Las Vegas and really positions SG as the chains more fancy or nicer bars. n nThis particular location is located right off the 215 on the SW side of town. Its easily 5 times the size of a traditional neighborhood bar complete with an upstairs private room which can be rented for special occasions. n nThe main reason that I and really any of my friends come by is for the cheap drinks and pizza during happy hour. The late night happy hour which starts at 12am every night takes half off all the drinks and the pizza at SG. This makes SG the perfect place for a late night excursion or cheap eat after a night of going out. Like most bars, the regular price drinks fun anywhere from 6 10 bucks, which turns into 3 5 during HH! Thats awesome! On top of that they are a pretty good selection of beers on tap along with some great specialty drinks. n nWhat brings in a lot of people of course is the food. The pizzas are also 50 off during happy hour and they are worth it. The thin crispy pizzas pair pretty well with any late night munchies you get. They have enough combinations of toppings and sauces to satisfy even the pickiest of pizza eaters. I wish they had other foods on the happy hour because pizza is not really up everyone's alley. n nThe only downside I have noticed to SG is their abysmal service when the place gets busy. Come in on a weekend night and it you have to go search for a server to bring you drink and food. I understand that because of the discounts, the servers don't make as much and probably don't want to work as hard, but that is still no excuse for poor service. n nAll in all its a great place to check our if your looking for cheap drinks and food.",2
"I've driven by here many times, and despite all the accolades, I could never make myself stop. For me, a big part of dining out is atmosphere and I wasn't too sure about Local Dish. I guess I prefer places with comfy booths, nooks and crannies and a little privacy. At the same time, I love the idea of supporting a local business. n nThis weekend, we finally went. I'm glad we did. Yes, the restaurant is one big open, bright room, no comfy booth in sight, but somehow, it works. Local Dish feels friendly, relaxed and the kind of place where the staff wil remember you. Our server was Kyle and he was soft spoken, but knowledgable about the menu and very efficient. n nAcross the board, our food was very good. The shrimp and grits dish was very creamy and rich. I've been craving it ever since. Sandwiches were all tasty burger and PLT . The buns were especially fresh and tasty. The food came out very, very quickly. Impressive for such a small place. We tried the bread pudding and their new strawberry cake for dessert. Both very good not great, maybe but they cured the sweet tooth.",2
"This place is DUMP, and I cannot understand how they stay in business! NEVER again! Horrible service, Dirty, crowded, and the food was tasteless and expensive. I had the Nicoise Salad 20.00 hardly any toppings or tuna, served with this pathetic buckwheat pancake on top. Everything felt dirty from the glasses to the dishes. They dont take Amex like most places in Montreal and dont accept American money. NOt worth the wait, time and money!",1
Excellent menu both food and beverages . Unique pizza crust making this a great place to get good pizza that's out of the ordinary but very tasty. Great tasting beers as well. Service was very friendly!,2
