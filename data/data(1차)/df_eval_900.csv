"UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP. n nI was a loyal customer to Fashion Nails for the past 2 years until their recent management change. I have given them the two tries since the switch but its a complete 360 from what they were. They have terrible customer surface, and frankly I think I could go the Walmart in the shopping complex for the same quality service. The polish on both my manicure and pedicure chipped in less than a week. I have never been so disappointed.especially after being so happy for finding such a wonderful place. Not to mention the terrible job the girl did on my eyebrows! n nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!",1
"Is this place under new ownership? We've always liked it here a charming little hometown place, but the last time we were there, a guy was occupying a table in the front, on his cell phone conducting business while a younger man with long hair was running his fingers through his hair at the same table while putting together donut boxes. I didn't recognize either one of them. Very unprofessional and not what we're used to at our favorite donut shop. Just learned today that Granny Mac's is closing. Sad news for a local place that was such a treasured and rare establishment in the 'Burg.",1
"I'm addicted to their popcorns after a few bites. I got the Chicago Mix caramel crisp and cheedar cheese . I think I like the Caramel Crisp better. Next time when I am at Las Vegas, I will probably get a big tin of their popcorns.",2
"If I could give zero stars, I would. I received an inedible sandwich dark meat chunks, fatty . Tried to register a complaint with store but they wouldn't answer their phone and apparently have no voicemail. Tried website, twitter and facebook. No one has taken the situation seriously and they keep passing the buck. Not impressed from top to bottom. n nNot the only bad experience by any means but definitely the worst. Food often tastes like it's been sitting out a while under the heat lamps. Below average compared to other KFC's.",1
"The food was pretty ok and the drinks were inexpensive and well made. My biggest problem with this bar is that despite the karaoke bringing an interesting crowd, there was a huge brawl out front and we had to be locked inside the restaurant until the police came and made an arrest. The male in the fight had beaten a female so bad that she was immediately taken to the hospital by an ambulance. n nLesson learned even though this bar is in a decent area, females.do NOT go there alone! the female apparently did not know the guy ",1
"Holy foodgasm! That's a direct quote from dinner here with my friends last week. We went on a Friday, which I would NOT recommend the was quite a long wait to get seated. Service was good, but a little blatantly one sided. Maybe the server could actually address then entire table, and not just the hot chick.not so subtle my friend, I'm just sayin. n nThe food here was good. They didn't reinvent the wheel, or even try to. The menu is a random assortment of someone's favorite foods, each one seemingly executed well. There is a note on the menu that substitutions will be politefully declined. I was concerned about this, as with my food allergies, eating out can be tricky. They were more than willing to serve me a custom grind burger sans bun, with extra lettuce for wrapping. It came out deconstructed on the plate, with a bowl of fries. I was disappointed at first that I wasn't offered any dipping options for my fries, but once I tasted them, I understood why. These fries were excellent. They stood alone, and anything to dip them in would have been an injustice. Then I tasted my burger. One of my friends also had a burger with the bun and 2 hilariously large tots, and the other had a vegetable casserole? If I remember correctly . There was a collective silence at the table as we all had our first bite, and stared at each other in disbelief. No one could believe how simplistically good the food was, and the fact that we all thought so, that's an almost impossible feat. As a group. We rarely agree on anything food related. n nI think the drinks were overhyped a bit. I had a Moscow mule, which was ok, but not exceptional by any means. The waiter helped my friend select a beer which she seemed to enjoy. n nThis place is more Scottsdale than I expected, but that wouldn't stop me from returning I'd just pick a different night to avoid the wait.",2
Love this resort. But wondering where my dues are going. Nothing seemed to work properly in the penthouse. Fortunately the weather was nice. No need for broken thermostat.,2
"I made an appointment at this location 2 weeks ago. When I show up at the agreed upon time I am informed there isnt an appointment under my name. Instead of apologizing for their error, the representative immediatley states I must have called the wrong location and proceeds to call a nearby store. Of course, they didnt have anything under my name either, but that is because I didnt schedule the appointment there. You would think at this point an apology would be appropriate but no, I am told they are booked solid and the vehicle might get squeezed in if left all day. After further review a sliver of time is found for 3 hours later. Guess who is the only one inconvenienced, the one that made the good for nothing appointment to begin with. As we all know the key to taking a reservation is holding it, anyone can TAKE a reservation.",1
I love this place.they have some of the best sushi. Order the Double D.it comes with a screaming orgasm sauce that puts an extra kick to your tastebuds.,2
So many TV screens it is a MAN's heaven. You can bet on pretty much any event that is going on there. They have a full bar and menu. I did not eat anything there but It looked like basic bar food. n nThey have modern comfortable couches and a real low key vibe. Good place to watch a game or fight.,2
"I don't know what happened to this place. Loved it a few months ago. I visited this week during CES on a Monday and paid 35 to get in. n nIt was not the same experience at all. All the food was dried up and I just didn't feel satisfied at all. There were a lot of Japanese businessmen sitting next to me and they were all ranting in Japanese how bad it was throughout my meal too. They even talked about going to another restaurant afterwards. n nTo top it off, all the dried up crab I was eating gave me food poisoning which gave me a bad stomach ache diarrhea vomit for a week now. It ruined my Las Vegas vacation and the days after. n nI will never be returning to Wicket Spoon. It's not worth the chance to ruin my vacation in that way again. n n nUpdate As an added bonus, I emailed their management about this and got no response.",1
"This radio station features dance electronica music. I enjoy listening to it, however they play the same tracks over and over.it gets old real fast. I pop in from time to time to break the monotony. n nAnother thing I like about this radio station is that there are very few commercial breaks. n nWill I continue to listen? Sure, but need a break now and then.",2
"Absolutely the best crepes I have ever had! There's always a wait, which can be a little frustrating, but the staff owners always go the extra mile to take care of everyone really well. And did I mention that their crepes are amazing?!",2
"Sunday Diner's Beware! Tonight they were out of all pasta products, including the Mac Cheese I was craving. I decided to get soup, however they were also out of rolls. Also, they were out of their Mango Tea. Their excuse for being out of everything I ask for? ""We're normally out of almost everything on Sunday's. "" If this is something that happens every Sunday then whomever orders should be smart enough to plan for it.",1
I was so excited when they built The Hotel Palomar at City Scape. I love the sustainable concept and reused materials and art that make it so unique. The blue hound kitchen is a very hipster and very kool. Joe and I went there on our date night a few weeks back. I don't know the bartenders name but his handle bar mustache was fantastic I loved his style. This guy was absolutely talented. He wasn't your run of the mill cheesy bartender you normally run into out here. The drinks were awesome and unique. Joe ordered an oaxacan punch he loved it. next time we go we are trying the smith and wesson.,2
"You had me at free warm chips and salsa bar. This place is almost perfect in my eyes although the Horchata needs some serious work. They also seem to have late hours AND a drive thru. Pretty damn good food to get in a drive thru if you ask me. n nI ordered a Carne Asada burrito and a large Horchata. The Burrito was around 5 bucks, but they give you free chips and they have an excellent salsa bar to accompany them. The burrito surprised me by having beans and rice mixed with the meat unlike other joints. It was still delicious and the meat was tender and flavorful and I didn't have one piece of grizzle. Refreshing since almost every burro I get from Roberto's has at least one piece of meat I have to gracefully spit out. This burrito was heaven. n nThe restaurant is clean and has plenty of room to eat comfortably. I did also try their homemade pineapple juice which I will be ordering on my next visit which is tonight!",2
"This is one of my favorite bars in town. When I meet tourists and they want to do a non Vegas, strip related activities, and to experience local bars, this is one of my top recommendations. Obviously, the tiki room is a luau style island style bar. They have signature rum style drinks. On their menu each drink has a rating 1 5 ""skulls "". My favorite is the Wild Watsui 5 skulls. It's not strong, not too sweet, but gets the job done. What's also great is surf music that they play. Think Dick Dale and the Del tones or The Phantom Surfers. If you really like the bar, you have to buy Frankie's tiki glassware. They have multiple choices tiki man, eastern island, volcano . It's a small bar but once you walk in, it is a must love environment.",2
"I'm greek, and grew up in a greek town in New York, so I know how the food should be made and taste. The gyro was RAW and when I approached the Mexican cooks they said that's how we make them! Don't go for you will get sick. This place is the worst.",1
"I'll be honest, we used to go here all the time. Every single time, they were rude to us, but it was worth it for the delicious chicken gorditas. However, the final straw was when we found a toothpick in our taquito. No, I dont mean it was poking out, I mean it was wrapped in the tortilla inside with the chicken. My sis BIT into it. That same time, I chomped something hard, it was a big piece of gravel. In my chicken gordita. Ok, we're gringas, but I used to work in Mexico and speak some spanish. I am used to anti gringo attitudes, I used to get called all sorts of names walking around. However, this place is the WORST I have ever experienced, especially here in the states, and I truly believe, to this day, it was because we are gringas. Gravel doesnt just ""accidentally "" get into chicken. Nor does a toothpick get fried into a taquito. I havent returned. I will always miss their gorditas.",1
"I've been here a couple of times. My thoughts n nMy boss introduced me to this place and I thought it was okay. No complaints whatsoever but didn't think it was that great either but I thought I would go back again.but that was then. n nThis is now.A friend from Reno moved to LV to study and she said she misses her pho back home so I said I'll take her to a good place so I took her here. She ordered exactly what she would order in Reno but boy was she disappointed when she tried her order. I didn't really know what the difference was compared to what she was used to but I guess it was really that bad since after having only 3 spoonfuls, she gave up to the point that she decided she didn't want to finish her food. I felt embarrassed because on our way there, I was prepping her to look forward to some awesome pho but the only thing that she had was disappointment.",1
"Troy with TKS installed an R.O. system for me in my kitchen and he did it fast, cheap, and with superior quality. Now I have clean tasting water thanks to Troy.",2
4.5 stars rounded to 5 for service. Staff was awesome. They direct you to your door with a gold cart when you arrive. We booked a king and we were upgraded to the suite! n nThe grounds are beautiful. Well designed and well maintained. n nThe room we were in was massive. One weird thing is the room was completely upgraded and modern except for the door knobs. Don't know why they didn't spend the extra money to make the finishing touch. Maybe they aren't done yet. n nThe price for a king room is reasonable. n nThe pools were also well maintained and we had the 20 person hot tub all to ourselves. n nI would go back!,2
Favorite place,2
"I've had two markedly different experiences at this place. When I went in on Monday evening with a girlfriend of mine, the service was very good and the drinks were excellent. nI actually found myself craving another one of their margaritas last night! n nThis time around I showed up with a guyfriend of mine. I wouldn't mention this if I didn't think it had some effect on the service. So here's what happened last time, me and my friend ordered at the bar, and the bar staff took great care in making our cocktails. This time around, my friend offered to get the drinks. Now, he's not the best lookin' guy out there, and he was a bit underdressed for the occasion but he wasn't wrapped in a blanket carrying a trashcan, underdressed . nHe ordered the drinks at the bar and when he got back with them, my margarita was clearly watered down. It had not been strained as it should've been, so I had an embarrassing coughing fit because some of the lime skins got stuck in my throat yes, that's me being clumsy, but still . Also, there was no lime part on top of the glass, as there had been last time. Instead, I found a squeezed out lime drifting halfway down the glass. n nNow I don't know if they thought he just didn't deserve good service or drinks, but what I do know is that I won't be coming back here again. If we pay that much for drinks, we expect them to be good. Yeah, he's no Brad Pitt, but this just felt really unfair and discriminating to me. And I could tell that he was embarassed as well . n nIt's such a shame too since I had a great time on Monday and was thinking of making this one of my more regular fancy cocktail hang outs. Guess it's time to move on!",1
I enjoyed this pub. AZ is really lacking in places that have a quality pub feel. This one has it. n nNever tried the food. Beer prices can be a bit high at 4 each but whatever. Will go at happy hour next time and see what kind of specials they run.,2
"I myself am not a Vegetarian or Vegan, but I can appreciate that style of food and often eat meat free meals. So when I was invited to go to Red Velvet Cafe with a co worker for lunch on a Friday in Lent I figured it was a great idea. I've given up eating meat on Fridays so I thought there would be good Vegetarian Vegan options for me. n nWhen we entered, there was a couple empty tables and a counter with a register, which appeared to be where you place your order. At the counter we were instructed to take a seat and we would be waited on. We took a couple laminated menus and sat at a table just across from the register. After looking over the menu I selected a Salmon Quesadilla from the March specials menu. After an unnecessarily long wait, we were finally visited by our server who was the same person that told us to take a seat from behind the register. I was then informed that they were out of Salmon. The 2 other members of my party ordered and I asked for another minute to find something else. However, it took so long for our server to return that everyone else's food arrived shortly after I placed my 2nd order. The other two orders at the table had errors missed substitutions, meat product instead of real meat but they didn't want to spend the extra time to complain about it. My food finally arrived as everyone else was finishing theirs. Being on a 1 hour lunch break, I had to request my order to go, because I needed to be back at work. They slid my sandwich and handful of baked Lays into a box and I ate my lukewarm sandwich in my office at work. Food was decent, but not worth the 11 bucks I paid and the lousy service I received. Based on other reviews this is not uncommon for this location. n nOther things to know before going nThe only thing ""Vegetarian Vegan "" about this restaurant is the fact that anything on the menu can be ""Made Vegan "". This means they substitute the real meat for fake soy based meat product. Almost all the items on the menu contain real meat and will have to be ""Made Vegan "". I also noticed that the same grills griddles are used for meat and vegetarian vegan, incase you care about cross contamination. For a place that markets themselves as a vegetarian vegan restaurant they do not have many non meat selections. n nThere is a 10 minimum on all Credit and Debit Purchases. This is against merchant agreements by Visa and Mastercard. But with the prices, you shouldn't have a problem spending less than 10 bucks. n nThere are no fountain sodas, everything is canned bottled. n nWould I go again? Maybe, but only if I was eating meat and had a few hours to waste on lunch. If you're looking for somewhere to get a meal on a 1 hour schedule, look somewhere else. If you're a strict Vegetarian Vegan that is sick of eating soy meat product, look somewhere else.",1
"poor service, cold food, witnessed the wait staff being extremely rude to a family that brought their teenagers for lunch and play the ping pong, foosball, etc. n n I get that they are focusing on adults, but at 1 pm when the place is empty they should get over it. n nwont return. ever.",1
"Bobby b's review is very detailed and covered lots of information n nI decided to go there for a groupon special, 10 per person for spa admission instead of their regular 20, but since I purchased the aromatic massage and body scrub the admission fee was waived n nMy skin feels sooooooo smooth and new born after the scrubbing and massaging , me happy n nI will definitely be back n nThe only reason I am giving it a four star is that the steam rooms were way too hot and there were no icy towels outside them for people's convenience or to avoid people getting a 3rd steam burn , and for the life of me I couldn't find the room with all the wooden tubs as shown in the pictures n nBut all in all, I like this place and will be back whenever I am in town in Vegas n nanother complaint I have against this place is at the front counter they posted a sign ""any purchase with 90 or more receives a free bathrobe "". we purchased two aromatherapy massage and body scrubs, total 240, so when i asked them about the bathrobes not that our family really need them but since it's offered why not? "" and we were told it has to be ""gift card purchase of 90 or more "".to me, it didn't make sense. I guess i should have purchased two separate gift cards then spent them on the spa services lol n nanyways. next time when i am in town I will totally come back and enjoy a relaxing day ",2
"I haven't eaten at a Red Lobster for about 15 years, and my daughter talked me into going here. My previous experience in Central California was, in my fading memory now, pretty decent. This was a contrast. n nThe server was good, helpful and doing her best. She could not be held responsible for the food. Biscuits were ok good, but not great. That was the best part of our experience. n n19 year old had lobster shrimp fettucine. It was okay. Just okay. It wasn't ""bad, "" but one would expect better from a seafood specialty restaurant. n nPartner and I split the shrimp wrapped in bacon and steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli. We ordered the steak ""medium. "" The shrimp was ""okay, "" but the bacon was undercooked and rubbery. the broccoli was good and not overly cooked. The mashed potatoes were runny and tasteless. n n The steak was browned on the outside, but bloody and red throughout. It was definitely ""rare. "" We sent it back. The waitress explained that this was how they cooked their ""medium "" steaks. When the steak came back, it had been cooked a bit, but was still pink all the way through and ""rare. "" We sent it back again. The waitress explained that ""next time "" we should order ""well done "" if we wanted ""medium. "" We were still not happy, but they did cook the steak well the third time which we took to go at this point . n nThe manager came by with a laminated card showing a picture of how each steak should be cooked at ""rare, "" ""medium, "" etc. I was amazed their corporate policy is to undercook steaks at each level compared to what are standards for how steaks should be cooked everywhere I've ever been . Did I mention I used to be a restaurant cook? The manager did comp our meal, which was generous. n nThe staff really did their best, but the food was substandard and their policy on how to cook a steak is strange and against industry standards . You can do better elsewhere.",1
"I am writing an update cause I had the opportunity of sitting on the porch of the restaurant the other night with a companion cause it was pouring down buckets. It happened to be First Friday. We had ridden the light rail downtown to the AZ Science Center and thought we'd walk around to see what, if anything, exciting was going on. The owner's, Nobuo, wife served us. I ordered wine and I don't remember what my companion ordered. Either a beer or wine. I didn't pay attention. I believe Nobuo's wife's name is Sarah. My companion mentioned to her that he had met the owner prior, whereupon Nobuo came out to say ""hi, "" and we had a short chat. Both are such friendly and charming people. Very, very gracious and not the typical ""full of himself "" type of person that I've experienced with other restaurateurs around the valley who are world renowned.",2
The service waiter was excellent. Most of the food on the other hand was disappointing. Ordered the Lamp Lollipops for an appetizer and had to send them back because they were under cooked. For dinner I had the pork belly. it was dry and overcooked. My wife had the Lobster Mac Cheese and it was good not swimming in butter and cream like many restaurants prepare this dish. I will say the parsnip and leek soup was excellent. We shared a dessert the layered sour cream pound cake with almond cream and strawberry's which was difficult to share due to the narrow opening of the small mason jar it was served in and lacked consistent flavor through the layers.,1
10 for a Cr u00eape. Really? n nOverpriced Bad. Never ever again,1
"I know it is the airport.I'm not expecting excellence. BUT a place known for seafood should at least have quality seafood. I found the tuna to be a bit tough, almost steak like. The flavors weren't bad, but it just wasn't worth the price.",1
"The Phoenix Zoo is tucked away in Papago Park. Just look for some hills that remind you of Disneyland's Big Thunder Mountain and you've found it. It seems Phoenix could do a better job directing traffic to this little gem. I never saw one sign until we arrived, basically. It's a great oasis for all ages. Little kids can fall in love with all sorts of animals while older kids can get a thrill from the zipline ride. There are so many snack options including popcorn, ice cream, frozen lemonade and more. Plus there are lots of water attractions or the little kids like a little river under a tree playhouse and a water pad area. There were a lot more things to see then we saw so you could spend hours there. Don't forget to get a family portrait while you're there, too. They photoshop animals into some of the poses so it looks like your kids are holding a lion cub or other wildlife. We only stayed a few hot hours there but, I would recommend it to anyone visiting the Phoenix area. Very nice indeed.",2
First visit last night. Food was excellent two entrees linguine w clams and eggplant both outstanding. Superb wine list. Service extremely professional and friendly. Waiter very helpful and anxious to please without being overbearing. Not inexpensive but worth every penny. We will go again.,2
"Very impressed with my experience. I did not have to wait at all. They took me right after I finished my paperwork. Mona, my dental hygienist, and Dr. Mistry were fantastic. They were professional, personable, and made me feel comfortable. Would definitely recommend this office.",2
"I can't go back there any more. I love the breakfast but I can't take David, the rude server anymore. I've been going there for years and it is always the same. The last time I was there, he made a big issue with another customer about my changing tables. I'm pleasant and courteous to him but he is just got some repressed issue. And despite his dour attitude, I've always tipped him well. n nCarlos is great but he isn't usually serving. n nCrazy Otto's is off my list.",1
"There were plently of pleasant surprises on my first trip to The Hush Puppy yesterday. First of all, I didn't realize it was AYCE ribs night. Then when our waitress informed me that the AYCE rib special included shrimp and catfish. I was starting to complain to my wife that I didn't see hush puppies on the menu just about the time a basket of them arrived at our table with delicious honey butter in lieu of bread . The ribs were tender and came right off the bone and the BBQ sauce was good too. The fried shrimp were okay. I rarely eat fish, but since it was included, I gave it a shot. It was actually pretty good. I liked the cornmeal batter and was genuinely shocked how much I enjoyed the catfish. The biggest surpise came with the check. Between my wife and I we had two entrees with sides, hush puppies, salad bar access, one non alcoholic beverage, and two beers for just over 30. n nNothing is really spectacular here, but everything was good. I gave it 4 stars opposed to three because of the value. The ambiance and customer service matched my expectations of a place that charges around 10 15 a person. The food and portion size exceeded those expectations hence the value. I would certainly recommend trying it out and I will likely go back myself. n nThe only thing that comes to mind as a negative about The Hush Puppy is that it doesn't open until 5 00 pm. For me personally, it is the type of establishment I would prefer to frequent for lunch.",2
"Yeah, the building is attractive it reminds me of a Braun shaver in the daytime, and a martini glass at night. This review is not about the building, but about Duke Energy. n nWhere is Teddy Roosevelt, the trust buster, when we need him? There hasn't been a politician who cared about ""the people, "" since TR, or maybe FDR. Surely, our distinguished governor, Mr. McCrory, cares more about Duke Energy than he does about the local populace. Duke IS where most of his money is invested. Anyone who dares criticize Duke's money grabbing tentacles, is said to want to hurt their corporate profits and their shareholders. What about the blooming customers? n nMy problem with Duke Energy is personified by their latest commercial expounding ""we're boldly going where no energy company has gone before. "" Well, Capt. Kirk, why do average citizens and Duke customers have to pay for ALL your darned upgrades. What ever happened to using your corporate profits, budgeting wisely, and fiscal responsibility. In short, pay for the upgrades yourself, and stop trying to get massive rate increases each and every year. Last year, you absolutely had to have 15 more from your customers or the world was going to come to an end, but you settled for 7 . Our legislature was not intelligent enough to figure out that you were asking for more than you needed. So now its 2013, and here you come again with another rate increase demand. Are you folks serious? n nYour latest commercial says that the average consumer just flips on the light switch and takes it for granted that the power will be there. When I flip on my light switch, I hear the dollar signs clicking like the revolving dollars on a gas pump. My energy bill is hitting 300 per month in the winter and summer. As a currently unemployed person, this effing hurts. n nStop passing the buck along to consumers. Stop asking us to continually pay more for energy. If you want to upgrade and go green, check into wind farms, and solar energy like our educated brethren in the Scandinavian countries. n nAlso, step up and take responsibility for your coal powered plants polluting the Charlotte water supply. I wouldn't drink the water adjacent to your slag pits, and neither would you. You also need to take responsibility for the clean up of these unlined pits, and their leeching problem. You have the money use it to clean up the mess that YOU made. n nDuke Energy, you remind me of a beggar at an intersection, standing there trying to make us feel guilty, with a sign asking for money. Only later, do we find that this bast id is making six figures each year off the generosity and gullibility of their fellow citizens. n nIn short, put your out stretched hand back into your pocket, keep your eyes off my wallet, and practice fiscal responsibility. Your current policy of ""just keep asking for more money, "" reminds me of the Carolina Panther's asking taxpayers for money that they don't need and the stupid politicians just keep forking the dollars out. Frankly, the whole think is scandalous and sickening. n nWho's running Duke Energy now, Gordon Gekko? Greed IS NOT good!",1
" ""Full Court Press "" n nPress is a little intimidating at first the availability of menu items varies by time and day of the week, and pick it yourself bottles of wine are organized by category on shelves along the walls. But once their VERY friendly staff explain how things work, it's smooth sailing. VERY smooth sailing. n nWINE nThe wine selection is huge. And you can roam around the place and check out the bottles, which are organized by category big, bubbly, juicy, luscious, soft, etc. , at your own pace. There's no cryptic wine list to stumble through. Check out the bottles pick the one you want take it to your table. Price is marked on each bottle and these are RETAIL prices not restaurant mark ups! n nFOOD nThey have an awesome selection of cheeses and a gruyere fondue with plenty of bread for dipping. There are also several other small plate type choices and a couple of sandwiches that are always on the menu. At select times, they have a broader selection of sandwiches and even sushi and maybe even some other stuff ? . But the wine and cheese go well together, and if you get several small plates and dessert, you won't leave hungry. n nSERVICE nThe service was what made our trip. As I mentioned, the menu and way you pick your wine can be a little confusing, but Marie and Crystal walked us through it and were there to help when we had questions. n nATMOSPHERE nPress is like hanging out in your living room or on your patio if you sit outside . There's no pressure to pick the right wine to go with your food pick your favorite or something you've heard about or even a bottle with a label that you think is cool. No snooty sommelier is going to turn up his nose at your choice. n nIf you want steak or BBQ, you know where to go. But if you want to try something a little different, Press your luck. You won't be disappointed. n n Note the menus on the site are a subset of what they have for food, and the wine list on the site shows only wines by the glass and their expensive wines they have a ton of different bottles at a variety of prices that aren't listed.",2
"Located in the Heritage Square area right across from Pizzeria Bianco , the Rose and Crown is a great little bar that packs a ton of laid back charm. As a converted house, the front porch area has plenty of room for sitting outside and enjoying a pint or four with friends. The beer selection is good, with local favorites like Four Peaks mixed in with your Irish British beers. I have not eaten here yet, so I cannot comment on the food. n nOnce you step inside, they've managed to keep the individual ""rooms "" of the house, making it feel like you are truly still in a house. One room as a pool table, another has some seats and real darts not that plastic crap , yet another is full of tables and chairs for your dining enjoyment. n nService has always been friendly and attentive, and the people that roll into this place are from all walks of life. Parking can sometimes be a pain, due to its location near the sporting venues, but if a no frills laid back place for a beer is what you seek, look no further.",2
"Be careful, 15 gratuity will be added to the check without forewarning. n nThe server and staff that we encountered seemed not to be trained in the art of serving.",1
"This is THE hipster bar to go to, so make sure to wear your skinny jeans and suspenders! Although I have to be in the mood to go here, I generally have a good time. I generally avoid Saturday nights because the place gets way too crowded. The interior is probably the coolest of any place in the city, and there's always a cool band or show upstairs. The drinks and food here are a little pricey, but the beer selection is good and the veggie food is really tasty. Trivia on Wednesdays is a lot of fun, so bring a group of friends and you'll enjoy the night.",2

Warm, if anything. nThe hot chocolate covered by a pile of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Cold chocolate milk at best. n nOverall service was subpar. Food was mediocre.

I just moved to Charlotte and was trying to find a new nail place close to my house. I went in for a manicure and the lady decided she only had time for a polish change. A polish change is the easiest service for a nail tech to do and it was horrible so I can only imagine how the other services are. Luckily there are plenty of other nail salons nearby that do a much better job.,1
Had to call twice and sit on hold for 10 minutes for them to rudely tell me they don't have the item in stock. I will never visit this location based on that call.,1
Their broth is not flavorful enough but it's ok. The meat is good in the Pho but that's about it. Nothing too great And the Pho costs about 7 dollars. Good thing is their open 24 7. Would rather go to Cali for some Pho for sure!,1
"Was hungry for a late night snack and looked through yelp for some good eats. Read the review and decided to give Mickeys a try. Never had a Sonoran hotdog before coming here and I gotta admit I fell in love with it! The taste is sooo good it'll make you jus want more. I give this place 2 thumbs up and will be returning for more. Although a word of advice, it wouldn't be hard to know a little Spanish when entering this joint.felt like I was in Mexico again. All in all great place and budget friendly.",2
"If your idea of a fun night out is standing shoulder to shoulder watching a room full of douchebags and plastic women in a bar, then this is the place for you. Will not go back. Too loud, too packed, too fake. Bartenders were more concerned about performing then pouring some guy behind the bar was juggling, and then drinking liqour, from his SHOES.? , the meatheads in the bar were pre occupied with shining up their sunglasses that they wear ""at night "" .the entire vibe in this place is overwhelmingly douchey. Overpriced, too. At the bottom of my list for old town bars.",1
Love this place and I can't find anything wrong with this classic Italian deli. Counter service with a very expansive menu and a small store where one can purchase many Itallian goodies. I've had several sandwiches and each is excellent. I prefer the Itallian 2 when in the mood for a cold sandwich. Pizza looks good and so does everything else. Loved the Cannoli and the next time in I'm going for the stromboli. Get your Italian deli fix here!,2
