"I give this place a one star due to the bad service and I feel it it the fault of upper management. I went to this location on a Saturday night around 8 30, the restaurant was busy but not packed waiting about 10 minutes before someone came over i noticed that there were only two cooks and two people serving, taking orders, and working the front counter. We placed our drink order then waited and waited. 25 minutes after we arrived we finally got some of our drinks except for the shake the waiter forgot about. Food arrived and it was good but cannot get over the fact that there only was four people working. Several tables around me were also complaining about the service. Management of this location read these comments and other from other patrons, you Will find that everyone thinks your service sucks! Staff your restaurant accordingly. This was the third time I have been there and service is always the same. I will not be back anytime soon.",1
"To me Outback Steakhouse is on par with Applebee's or TGIFriday's nothing special. n nThe food is okay, the atmosphere is okay, the service is okay. n nA friend of mine loves this place so the boyfriend and I went there for dinner. We all ordered steak. I ordered the outback special a 6 oz steak with your choice of two sides I chose fries and veggies. You get all this for 10. And guess what? It tastes like a 10 steak. I guess I've been spoiled at places like Mastro's and Morton's because this steak was not even in the same galaxy as steaks from those places. But it was 10 so I wasn't expecting it to be the best steak I've ever had either. Honestly, for a cheap piece of meat it was pretty okay. In retrospect I with I would have shelled out a few more bucks, maybe I would have gotten something a little better. n nAll in all, Outback isn't horrible, it's just not great. It's a chain and you get what you pay for.",1
"Used to go here about 4 nights a week right after the gym. About a year ago, this place was great. Then it started to go downhill fast. That says a lot about ownership not paying attention. The people they have hired over the last several months have the absolute worst attitudes. I even had one time a girl tried to tell me they were closed early and that they were out of chicken. The male working there told me they do have chicken and that girl was trying to go home early. Now they no longer give discount to gym members. Portion sizes are about half of what they used to be. Service is worse than the Shell station employees down the street. On top of all that the last two times I went there to pick up a to go order, they were missing extra chicken we had paid for and gave us white rice instead of brown rice that we ordered. Sorry teriyaki boy owner, but you should have been paying better attention. 18 times 4 nights a week lost from us.",1
"Spirit airlines is THEE worst airline I've ever flown with. I flew from VA to Vegas and I was appalled that you had to pay for a carry on . At every other airline you get 1 free carryon and 1 free personal item such as a purse or a man bag with them you either pay 25 50 round trip during booking, 36 during online check in 72 round trip , 50 at the bag drop of 100 round trip or 100 at the gate 200 round trip . Your bag has to be 40lbs and under if it is over you pay an additional amount per how many lbs it is over. The seats were ridiculously SMALL. My flight took off 30 minutes later than expected and arrived an hour later than expected to our destination. Spirit is the worst airline I've ever flown and WILL never fly w them again also if you fly west coast to east coast you pay an additional 18 bag fee for going west to east. n n nGreat job spirit. Secret fees are pretty customer friendly not!",1
"You know a buffet is bad when you don't leave full. The food here wasn't as bad as prison food though my wife makes that comparison I do think it was comparable to low grade cafeteria food. Very low quality and made it extremely difficult to gorge yourself The line for the buffet made me think we would be getting something awesome, but it wasn't. Instead it turned out just to be a long wait for crappy food. n nOn top of that we went right at the cusp of breakfast and lunch. Now most buffets would keep some of the breakfast stuff out at least until noon. I had the luck of waiting in line for the breakfast stuff and then just as I got the front of the buffet, they decided to consolidate all the breakfast stuff to the OTHER side of the room, so I had to wait in line again. And of course by the time I got to the front, everything was almost gone anyway. Annoying! And the lunch buffet itself was just as disappointing. I highly don't recommend this place. Go to the Paris Buffet instead",1
"Revisited recently a few items to note n n Improved seating dining area. Looks like they remodeled the inside and it's more comfortable if you're dining in. Waiting for a to go order? Still a bit awkward, but at least there's a half wall to divide the entrance from the dining area. n n Service still a bit ""off "" very rushed feeling. Our server sat us and before our butts hit the chair he was asking what we wanted to eat. We asked for a minute, and he returned literally within a minute to see if we were ready. n n Pricey. 1.50 for a can of coke or a single cup of tea. Most entrees border 10. Most appetizers border 7. Papya salad, diet coke, and entree cost more than 20 before tip. That's steep, in my book, given the quality and quantity. n n Spice levels are perfect. Three spice will get your attention but won't overwhelm. n nFor the value, atmosphere, and service, you can do a lot better. Monsoon Siam destroys this place all day long.",1
"I went to dinner here on 10 28 2010. What attracted me was the reputation the restaurant had for it's authentic food and the Mariachi Trio music on Thursday night. What a disappointment it was! The steak fajitas came out and they were served as a pile of mostly onions and some green peppers. There was hardly any steak in the pile and what I did find had very little seasoning and was tough, definitely not top sirloin! nWe were also served chips and salsa which were OK, nothing special. nSince we were still hungry after eating the fajitas, we ordered sopapillas. nThey came out and again what a disappointment! Hardly any flavor to them and very little sugar coating on the outside. The honey syrup didn't come in a serving decanter but instead in cheap peel open packages you would find at a fast food restaurant. As I looked around i thought the only people that would eat here are tourists who will never come back and people who don't know what authentic mexican food tastes like.",1
"I really want to like this place but. n nThe service really leaves something to be desired, I think we confused the server by ordering appetizers because our entrees came out before our appetizers. When we asked about them she seemed really confused that we actually wanted to have them before our meals. When our meals finally arrived, my friend got her meal plus they put the appetizer in front of her but I did not get my meal. So we just ate the appetizers. I finally got my meal after inquiry. Also, the waitresses are quite surly. n nThe food leaves something to be desired as well. The bread for the cuban sandwich was very dry and very flaky. Very peculiar and hard to eat. n nOverpriced and it is a hassle to use their bathroom. You have to ask for a key and then walk down a sketchy outside hallway in the back of the restaurant. My advice Try to hold it until the El Cortez across the street.",1
"if there were zero stars that's what they would get. READ THE OTHER REVIEWS, the associates are trained to be SHADY! I reserved an economy car online for 2 days, 48 not bad and when I arrived Jessica at the counter told me it was a 2 door car that may not work for 4 ppl. I upgraded for 10.99 more a day which doubled the total cost of the rental only to find out from the very nice lady at the car parking garage the economy is a 4 DOOR CAR that can seat 4 people. I had to wait in line again to change the rental agreement which she smirked and said ""oh I hope it is still available "" ummm it's been less than 5 minutes and the nice car park lady told me she would hold the car for me. nCharged me for accidental insurace which she REFUSED to remove, try to scare me shitless about not buying liability and damage insurance. Oh yeah she was also giving the nice foreign family in front of me the same scare tatic and they upgraded to a bigger car too. nRENTER BEWARE!",1
"There is a reason this is the cheapest chain of studios in town. n nDirty, grimy feeling throughout the facility. nNot enough variety of classes or instructors. Need to add vinyasa flow and yin classes to the schedule. n nI can only go during the daytime before 5pm, and there are literally only 2 class options for me daily. n nJulie is there four mornings a week, and her yoga class is about as enjoyable as a root canal. She seems to lack any compassion or patience. Her Pilates and sculpt are ok, but I recommend Brigita,Tatiana or Seashell for Yoga. n nYou may want to bring your own weights to sculpt classes because they usually do not have enough to go around. n nYes they have showers but they are high school locker room style, with multiple shower heads in one big space. Thanks but no thanks. n nI really wanted to like this place after moving just down the street, but there are so many other great yoga studios in town that are more deserving of my time and money.",1
"Here's the deal As far as food goes, this place deserves 5 stars, its inventive, fresh, Mexican food and always amazing. The location is great and I would love to frequent it. However, the owner Azucena Tovar always comes off as a little ambivalent about her clientel, and I just can't get over it. We eat out a lot. My expectation and hope is an evening with great company, food, and service. Great company I can handle, great food Los Sombreros has covered.but the service makes me wince. The owner is the first person to greet you at the door and she is abrasive and has been rude kinda sets the tone, it's her place after all . Not once, not twice, but several times. I try and support businesses that value and appreciate their clients, especially in this financial climate. So my compromise is take out. We only rarely order take out and on the condition my husband picks it up so I dont have to be reminded why we no longer eat there. Christmas tamales are to die for.",1
"This past summer I built a new expanded porch on the front of my house. In the process I went to home improvement stores a lot. This Menards was recently remodeled and expanded. The yard area out back is much nicer and easier to get around than it used to be. The inside is huge, but arranged poorly. Now when you need to order stuff from the yard you have to go to the back corner farthest from the entrance. I get that they want you to wander through and maybe pick up random crap, but when all you need is bags on concrete it's annoying to have to make that trek. The new checkout lines are set up in a really dumb way. It forces the checkout person to have their back to you for most of the time that they are checking you out and you have to bag things yourself now. Inside the store I've had to hunt around when I did need help with something, but once found they sales people would be helpful. In the yard you can rarely find anyone to help with locating products or loading the heavier stuff.",1
"Food was really good. And it stops at that. Service sucks! Especially at night. There was one guy who I am presuming is the owner. He didn't seat us but just told us to find our own seats. He came and gave us menus and when we asked what he recommends he mumbled something and we had to turn our heads to look at him. Like literally turn our heads all around and he wouldn't look anybody in the eye. When he brought out the food he didn't tell us which dish is which and when we asked if he can name the platters again he mumbled and walked off. What kind of service is that? We had to walk over to the other tables and get our own forks and napkins. He didn't come once to check up on us to see how the food is, if we need anything etc. The most unfriendly socially awkward owner waiter I've ever seen. Also, portions are small. If the owner wants to keep his business around, he should be smart enough to take this review in consideration and improve on all of the above.",1
"Have had really bad experiences getting delivery two times from my original review so downgrading from 4 to 2 stars. n nThe chimichanga that I originally got Tofu asado has been made differently each time after it drastically different. n nFirst time was Cheese, vegetables and tofu. n nSecond time was Rice, beans and tofu no cheese n nThird time was Tofu and Steak no cheese n nI'm not sure how the same menu item can be made so drastically different with the third time being the biggest issue as I don't eat meat and actually had to complain to the delivery service for a refund. I'm not sure if it is an english translation issue or just a major mistake . I am not sure how such huge modifications can be made without my input to the meal I order. The chile relano is still great and something I would get again but I was not impressed by the enchiladas and the first chimichanga seems like a distant dream of goodness.",1
"OK I'll be honest. I LOVE their food especially the sushi . But their service can be REALLY bad. I've had to re order drinks multiple times, wait long times for a check at the table. and most recently I tried to place a pick up order over the phone. n nI asked to pick up my food in 1 hour, they asked why I was calling so far in advance. I explained that I was going to be in a meeting and couldn't call back in 30 minutes to place the order. Their response was that they would have it ready in 20 minutes, but I didn't want my sushi sitting for another 40 minutes before I picked it up. They said they couldn't guarantee to have it ready in an hour. SERIOUSLY? You're kidding, right? So, I hung up and won't be doing that again. I also cancelled my plans with a group of 14 friends to have dinner there this weekend. we're going to Stingray instead. n nI've lost my patience with Moto. Yea, the food is good but the service is just so ridiculously bad.",1
"Just came back from a weekend in Carefree I can't seem to figure out if I like this place or not. n nI think that if you like to golf and a very mellow place to stay you will enjoy your stay. Everyone here is as friendly as can be and really will go out of their way to make you stay worthwhile. n nThe problem is this place is not very good it's an older property and just not up to standard. n nThe room is ""ok "" and big enough but here is the problem we encountered on our trip birds. Apparently every bird in the area was out and about for the weekend and really pecking on the roof of our casita.starting and 4am all the way to 8am on off. It's an odd thing to happen when you are staying at a hotel but my god it was very annoying. n nThe TV was your old school tube didn't work very well. Feels like the room was put together in the early 90's and never has been updated. n nLastly, there was a cockroach in our tub. n n ",1
"2 star rating because I miss the original Treasure Island. Back when Steven Wynn owned it, the place was pirate themed and kid friendly with a pretty cool midway and outdoor pirate show. I loved the old sign with the pirate skull and swords. I also loved the Oatmeal soap. You can say I'm real bitter about the change. nNow? It's a shadow of what it once was. So they added a Circ show. Changed the outdoor show to the Sirens? Meh. They're trying to reel in the asian gamblers by adding Pho to their cafe. It's meh. There spa is called Oleksandra and they provide guest's with their products in the room. To me, the stuff smells funny. The only real pros are n AAA Four diamond hotel meaning, customer service should be off the chain good n Within walking distance to the other major hotels and casinos n Less expensive option if you're attending a convention across the street Venitian n Clean rooms",1
My mom and I are regulars at this location and tonight was just horrible. We love the greek cobb salad and we both ordered it but had some specifications for each one. Both came wrong. They took them back to fix it and it looked like stuff was thrown off the one and put on the other. The waitress came over and asked us what was wrong and we told her it looked like things were just thrown on it. She offered to remake them. We said okay. After 20 min we got our salads and the chicken and pita that are normally warm were cold like they were from the other salads. The manager came over 15 min later and acted like we were lying. She brought hot meat which was not even the right kind and said she saw them remake it which was a lie. We go in there at least 3 to 4 times a month but they will never see us again. The manager didn't even apologize and acted like we inconvenienced her to come to our table.,1
"Gonna keep this short and simple n nThe Phoenix roll was good. n nMy Hibachi Filet Shrimp was mediocre. The flavor was bland, and they provided no sauce to spruce it up. n nI ordered Hibachi fried rice thinking that it would be similar to some of the rice I've had at the Hibachi restaurants where they cook in front of you. Wrong. Instead, I got Chinese food delivery rice. Nothing about it was Japanese, and nothing about it was delicious. Get this crap off of the menu. n nMy major complaint would have to be our waiter. Uninterested does not begin to describe this man. He took forever with our drinks. He never filled our waters. My ""hibachi fried rice' was so bad that I wanted to ask for some white rice Which was supposed to come with my meal . Unfortunately, the waiter did not come by until about 35 minutes after we received our meals, and that was only to ask if we wanted the check. n nAll of this for 30 bucks? No thanks.",1
"Uhm. Shotgun Betty's. Okay.Ive come to Shotgun Bettys a few times.never really out of volition but more like ""Hey we have to go get so and so from Shotguns "". Low and behold, ""so and so "" is always male. Its definately a guy's place, but not because there are dancers on poles. No, no. Ive been to many strip clubs and felt welcome there as a woman because the servers are nice regardless if you are male or female, and they know that money is money whether it comes from a male or a female customer. These girls do not like female customers. Salty looks, snide comments, and waiting insanely long for what would be a simple vodka soda. However, if you are with a guy, your wait time is expedited exponentially. So yeah, I guess the only time I will be going back there is with a guy because otherwise its just not a good customer experience. n nOh.and the 20 minimum thing was just weird. Who does that?",1
"Friends and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Pretty packed but the line moved fairly quick, so it wasn't so bad. I can tell the place is catered to families as it brings out a pretty festive mood. However the lighting was quite dim so I really couldn't read the menu rather, my friend told me what she liked here and I ordered from her suggestion. n nMy partner and I split a beef and shrimp fajita . I really like how they give you nachos, kind of fills you up a little. Portions were decent, but food was a bit average. For the fajita, I liked how they gave you the food in a customizable way assemble your own type of thing . I also tried my friends dishes and drink as well quesadilla, chicken fajita and the bull dog margarita. I didn't like any of those three. We were waiting for water for quite some time as well. It was only when we were about to leave that they gave us more water. Overall, I think I would come back if we had large group with last minute dinner plans.",1

"I suspected this was a chain. And i should have went screaming in the other direction instead of having breakfast here. But hadn't really checked out the area by the hotel yet, and when you are starving for breakfast you'll make crazy choices. n nI ordered the bagel and smoked salmon. Bagel was barely toasted, the salmon barely smoked and the three capers they put on the plate, not nearly enough. And when I found out the price was really 13.95 and not 9.95 as printed in the english menu, pretty much decided never to darken their door again. The other bad thing wasn't what happened with my poor over priced food and outdated menu, but the table next to me were two poor brits who just never go the right food. The whole time the waitress was messing things up the manager was sitting enjoying his coffee chatting with the line cook. n nPlenty of other better choices in the area, don't be like me and settle for the first thing you see!",1
"This place did guarantee an unrivaled experience as advertised. nCheck in was the worst I ve ever encountered in 40 plus years of travel. nSupermarket style check in instead of a next in line set up. nAt 5 pm no rooms were ready. I asked if this was true for everyone else checking in and the counter person said yes ,the 3pm check in was only an estimate .but I could get an upgraded room for 100 more a night. nLater I found out that some people upgraded for 75 .they said they would call when the room was ready ,they didn't t so I waited in line again to find out the room was ready.and was told what s the bid deal . You only waited an hour. Other people I spoke to waited for over 5 hours. Totally unacceptable.others had room keys that didn't t world and another friend was given a room with someone in it already.casino ventilation was horrible,casino was smokey.you could hear people in the hall way from your room. Staff was not friendly at all. nThis place needs to get its act together",1
"So I went on a Sunday night and let me just say that it was not that amazing. My friends and I were on the VIP list and walked right in. Most of the club was actually closed off and the only place you could go was the roof. It was really packed and almost impossible to get to the bar. When we did get to the bar, we ordered our drinks, got them, but I didn't get my credit card back. They said that their system was down and I had to wait! I waited almost a half hour at the bar for my damn card and id! I was furious and they still made me pay for everything. I complimentary shot or something would have been nice. This is one of the most exclusive and popular clubs in Vegas and their system went down? I could understand if the entire club was open and exploding with people, but really, it was just the roof? They played Michael Jackson for about an hour, which was fun, but kicked everyone out at 2Am? I thought Vegas clubs go til 4 or 5? Guess not here.",1
"Had lunch at Los Gemelos, the one off of Odana Rd. It is located in the back of the Mexican grocery store. The menu is small, which is fine, the prices are decent. The chips and salsa were terrible, I hate to say that, but they were. The salsa comes out to you in squirt bottles, you are just supposed to squirt it all over the basket of chips I guess. The salsa is pretty spicy, I didn't care for it. I ordered a steak taco, it was edible, the ingredients seemed fresh, but it was so bland and dry, I squirted the lime on it, and put some of the salsa on it also. I also ordered the chicken quesadilla, again, bland, no flavor whatsoever, greasy fried corn breading fill with flavorless chicken, boring cheese and lettuce. My husband ordered the chili relleno plate with rice beans, it also came out with some corn tortillas, he wasn't very impressed, he said the same thing, it was just bland. I think we will stick to Taqueria Guadalajara on Park St. I wanted to love this place, darn it.",1
"Seriously, I'd go negative if I could. I have NEVER EVER walked out of a restaurant in my life until I came here. n nRUN DOWN DENNYS SENIOR CITIZEN HOME SIDEWALK CAFE n nI got super trashed at XS the night before so I had to skip out on my reservation at Craftsteak. I didn't want to go there looking like a zombie. Sidewalk Cafe was the closest spot getting off the elevator. GF and I got seated farily quick. One girl taking order for drinks. Steak and shrimp dinner special for 11.99? Alright! Ok not really. 15 20 minutes go by. We are staring at each other like, ""Where the hell is our server "". Then we see 1 lady serving and bussing over 10 tables. n nConclusion Forget it! Downed our waters and walked out. n nI tried to make a second attempt here because this is the ONLY place in Bally's that actually serves breakfast. But nope, that line was super long and I knew that line wasn't the only thing I'd be waiting in. n nAttempt 2, failed.",1
"I went here on a Tuesday afternoon at about 5PM. I was the only one in the restaurant, and there was only one hostess that had to juggle answering the phone, serving me, and helping people picking up take out orders. n nIt went smooth enough though, and my order came fast, within minutes. I ordered the chicken with green beans, one of my favorite Chinese dishes back home. Unfortunately. it's hard to believe I'm saying this, but the dish was completely tasteless . In fact, the only thing I could taste was the oil, and oil does not taste too good. n nThe dish just seemed to be poorly cut chicken and old green beans tossed in some cooking oil and stir fried. There was a little soy sauce, but it did nothing to add to the flavor, and only added to the color. n nAll and all, the place is nice inside, and for only one waiter, the service was good. Unfortunately, the food was extremely bland, and I will not be going here again. I probably could have done better at home.",1
"I will NEVER, EVER go back here. End of story. n nI went with the boyfriend right after it opened in Feb. '08. It was some special neither of us paid cover and it was 5 cosmos for ladies. The funny thing is my beer drinking BF ordered a Cosmo and received it for 5, maybe the waitress thought this funny or something, I sure did. n nAnyway, the music was out of sync between the two piano players, the kitchen was closed and it was only 10 or 11 PM and the guy playing the piano reminded me of a super annoying Joe Pesci with his dumb jokes. They embarrassed some drunk girl on her birthday with really vulgar stuff. n nI'm not a prude, in fact I'm pretty foul mouthed and minded, but if this guy said that stuff to me I probably would have knocked him right off his piano stool. n nWe finished the only drink we ordered, payed our bill and booked it to The Yardhouse to enjoy the reverse happy hour and some beer.",1

"Buzz kill! It was 3p and there was only 4 varieties, all of which were basic and underwhelming. Thinking they were closing soon, I asked what their hours where. After commenting on the sparse assortment, and finding out there is no cooking on site, the clerk said ""there might be more coming from another store "". I also inquired about the ingredients, wanting to know more about the quality of ingredients used. The gal replied with ""she didn't' know "" since she didn't cook them. Give me a break! Product knowledge, especially when it comes to food is standard. Most bakeries are known for something using organic ingredients, having a signature cake, ect. n n I ended up with chocolate. At 3.50 a pop, it had way too much frosting, cake was dry could be compared to a Safeway bakery cupcake, just more presentable. I'll take a sprinkles cupcake any day where at least you know your getting top of the line ingredients and almost always have a great selection of flavors.",1
"While the Campus Inn offers quite a bit of charm and while the Inn's lobby has been renovated quite extensively, what really disappointed me was the outdated room that I received and the very flimsy bed and old sheets in that room. n nNow, the hotel does offer free wifi, a decent breakfast and a manager's reception, but as a business traveler, those perks eventually come standard with any hotel. On the other hand, the room that I received could have been better. n nThe bed was small and quite uncomfortable, and the room had clearly once been a smoking room. The bathtub also did not drain properly. I thought long about calling them to fix it, and just decided that it wasn't really worth it, since I only planned to shower once a day anyway. n nIn all, I have a good idea of what to receive given a certain location and price point, and I just felt that at the Campus Inn's price point, given that it's in Madison, WI, it didn't really offer much value for me to recommend it.",1
"I hate to give local businesses bad reviews, but this place is fuckin uuuup! nGave this place's menudo a shot while experiencing the hangover from hell on a Sunday morning. The restaurant has a beautiful menudo poster on the window. Large pieces of honeycomb tripe, fresh lime, crushed red pepper and cilantro.To a Mexican with a hangover, there is no better sight! n nSo I walk inside and order a bowl, about 5, standard price. I take a seat and a few moments later, I'm greeted with a heaping bowl of hominy and a few shitty pieces of tripe. The red chile was a deep, dark red and looked very old. Shocked that my menudo looked absolutely nothing like it did on the poster outside, I dug around in my bowl, looking for some kind of hope that I would find a mere trace of what was advertised outside. n nA few panicked spoonfuls of hominy later, I gave up and went next door to Fry's for a can of Juanita's menudo.",1
"I decided to give Cherry's Berries a try because it's in close proximity to my gym. The inside is surprisingly clean and I question whether it's from lack of customers or because an employee is going around frequently sweeping the floors and wiping down the tables. n nI ordered the mango banana oatmeal sweetened with honey. While I was sitting down waiting for my smoothie to be made, the male employee asked me if he should use juice or milk and I told him whatever the recipe calls for. He pulls out a book to see how to make the smoothie. n nWhen I tasted the smoothie, the ratios were off. There was too much ice which made every ingredient taste watered down and gave the smoothie a slush like consistency. I could hardly make out the banana or mango and even though the menu says sweetened with honey it tasted artificially sweetened. n nThe lack of fresh fruits and low quality ingredients make the smoothies taste icy and artificial.",1
"Let me start out by saying that I didn't give Desert Sky Pavilion two stars because I didn't have a great time. I saw Mumford and Sons here a couple of months ago and the concert itself was phenomenal. HOWEVER, I made the mistake of buying lawn tickets because 1 they were cheaper, and 2 I thought it would be fun to cuddle up on a blanket with my hubby as opposed to being condemned to two hard seats all night. The concert went awry when the back speaker went out.the only one supplying the left side of the lawn with beautiful music. Everyone that was within earshot of the blown speaker started screaming ""TURN IT UP! We can't hear! "" ruining whatever music was left for us to hear. Needless to say, the concert would have been 1000x better had it been held at a different venue. Thanks, Desert Sky Ak Chin whatever. n nOverall, unless its your ALL TIME ABSOLUTE favorite artist, skip this place.",1
"I really hate to do this, but after over 5 recent visits, my feelings toward Ginbu 401 has faded and I think I will move on. Ginbu is not too far my office and also delivers to my home, only a few miles away so I have taken advantage of both, restaurant visits and delivery. nI have typically ordered sushi, which I feel has gone downhill. The sashimi slices seem to have shrunk over the years and aren't the best pieces of fish I have seen had. And, I don't really feel like they offer a good varirty of rolls, almost everyone includes a fried item or cream cheese. nHowever, being disappointed with the sushi I decided to check out their chinese dishes and ordered the Sechuan spelling? chicken and UGH is all I will say! The chicken tasted like frozen chicken and I ended up spitting have of every bite out because it tasted so bad. I resolved to eating the bland white rice they sent and the veggies out of the dish which weren't that great either. I won't make that mistake again.",1
"Ok. what?!? An average of around 4 or 5 stars, for a Yo Sushi!? You have got to be kidding me. n nRight, here is my main issues laid out bare. That food that circulates round on the little conveyor could have been sitting there for goodness knows HOW long!? A proper Sushi joint. made to order, oh and eh. fresh. I quite quickly got past the novelty of watching all the different food go round and round as soon as I tried it. I don't think I have really had a plate here that actually had alot of flavour to it. n nIt is also pretty pricey, and walking through Harvey Nic's just to get to it makes me feel as small as humanly possible, as all those draped in Gucci and Prada strut their stuff about like it matters. n nSo basically, I am not a fan. The staff, I can't really comment, it's not like they really do alot, you pick the plates up yourself!? The price, totally not worth it. The surroundings, pretentious and not my cup of tea and most importantly the sushi not great.",1
"I tend to get dragged into this particular Ross Store. But it honestly reminds me of a Goodwill version of Walmart. I'm not ragging on Goodwill, because I occasionally shop there to keep up with my out of date hipster style, but since I'm associating it with Walmart which is a stone's throw away you could imagine the amount of fail that is within those doors. n nYes, their are some good deals there but the atmosphere, long lines, horrible customer service just leaves me wondering ""how the hell is this place still in business "". n nAnd what the hell is the deal with those long poles on the shopping carts? This isn't Michigan where you need poles on top of your car to see around corners in the winter. It's like Ross thinks their demographic is remedial adults or something. And how does the line always a 15 minute wait. n nSeriously people, TJ Maxx isn't that far and it's the same exact thing, minus the shitiness.",1
"From 5 stars to 1 star within 24 hours. Yesterday's dinner was a perfect experience with Cody our waiter who was a fantastic, professional server. Tonight, a different waiter older, with short grayish hair and glasses who failed to introduce himself and gave off a harried and disinterested vibe. Sure enough, the service was absolutely dreadful, just dreadful. Never checked our table for silverware and my partner had to ask for a spoon when he brought coffee. Was in the middle of my appetizer salad when two entree plates get abruptly plopped on the table. The waiter became defensive when I commented it's proper to wait until the guest is done with the first course and I felt he was basically challenging my request. Seriously, giving a customer a difficult time is a no no, but not for this guy. He is a representative for the restaurant and his was a pathetic display of ineptitude. Shame on him.",1
"Order takers are rude and don't listen. Ordered a walnut muffin, and she punched in banana. Asked to have it warmed up but alas, No microwave to heat your muffin. Must be hard getting help in Vegas. However barista made a good Upside down nonfat CM. But the rest of the crew needs to pay attention. Hey, I'm from another country too. This Starbucks is in the Planet Hollywood Hotel. n nOK next day 2 3 2011 gave them a second chance, it is the year of the rabbit afterall, this time my coffee was completely wrong. Ordered it upside down again and watched her put the shots in wrong. Then she calls out it is upside down, I told her it wasn't but she ignores me and doesn't want to make it again. Lowered my rating further. I visit every Starbucks no matter where I am and this is the worst. Starbucks needs to hire secret shoppers and get rid of those who really don't want to work. If you dont want to pour coffee, go do something else, it is Vegas after all.",1
"So it's been a while since I've been to a Church's, this one recently opened in our 'hood. I think I know why I stayed away so long. nWe used the drive thru for our order. Service time was reasonable. Staff was friendly and answered our questions. We ended up ordering an 8 peice Mixed Chicken Special, we asked to make sure that it included 2 breasts since that's what my husband likes. LOL. They assured us it would. nWell there was one breast so my hubby got screwed but he is willing to eat dark meat too. We got the chicken original style, so we could gauge how good the chicken is without heat. Well it was moist inside crunchy outside, not too greasy but utterly tasteless. The mashed potatoes and gravy were worse than school cafeteria potatoes. The coleslaw was okay. The biscuits are super small, but they were the best thing we had. 15 for that, I'm sad. n I will not be returning. Popeye's and KFC are better by far and that's not saying much.",1
"The staff was friendly, as usual. But I feel like I got the short end of the stick. About 5 months ago I had gotten suckered into buying a detail with a paint sealant. I figured that having a new car use both to keep them in the best shape. However, when I came back to get this done the salesman notice I had some water spots and up sold an additional 100 because I would ""need a buff wax too "" to remove the water spots before I sealed it. Made logical sense to me. nOnce I got home, I noticed so many issues with a sloppy wash the white wax was all over my black side boards, the windshield is messy at the bottom, the console cup holders weren't washed and the overall made it look sloppy. I plan to go back to get them to rectify but I know they have a ""48 hour policy "" that they make you sign about.but 220 to get a sloppy, half done job is NOT worth future time or money. Not sure I'll go back!",1
"Why only one star you ask? Well unless you have time to call them and ask all the questions or thoroughly read their website, let me give you a cliff note version because I refer to Yelp when I'm on the go. n n1. This is not a store front bakery shop. It is free delivery only. However, there is a 10 charge to deliver to the outskirts of Vegas so ask ahead of time. You cannot pick them up on your way home from work or on your way to a party. Must be delivered. n2. You must place an order 48 hours in advance or you are charged a ""rush "" fee. They don't have cupcakes in stock or ready to go. n3. The minimum order is one dozen n nTo explain my example, I called at 11am and asked directions to stop by and purchase 4 cupcakes. Based on what I just explained above, if it were even possible my order total estimated 65 plus tax. n nBetter plan ahead next time! I do look forward to tasting them at some point.",1
"I hate to downgrade this place, but it's totally necessary. After telling everyone how great this place is, we took a friend there for dinner. Being pregnant, hungry and soon to be chubby, I ordered two main dishes. I love saag and I love masala sauce so I ordered both. My chicken tikka masala was good and made to order. My friend got that as well and liked hers. The hubby liked his curry, too. We had exceptional service that night. Where they get downgraded is that they without a doubt served me leftover saag from the lunch buffet. The spinach was browned like it had been left under a heat lamp all day, it had tell tale paneer in it that they missed removing even though I ordered it plain, and it was spicy as hell even though I ordered it mild. So disappointed in this place for trying to pull a stunt like this. Even though I feel this place may still be the best in town.I'm now on the hunt for my new favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas.",1
"Ok, I have tried three times to like this place. But they keep failing me. Maybe it's startup jitters? n nMy main issues nToo pricey. Today was over 14 for a crazy Greek burger, gorgonzola fries and a soda. The bigger had cheddar cheese and a few bits of gyros. Fries were a 2 up Chafee to have them throw some cheese crumbles. nThe burger. Ok, I like the 6 oz patty, but it is frozen and uninspired. Three bun is simple, there is no gourmet at all about any of this, except the name. Nor worth the price. nThe small things. Only 8 choices on the soda machine, today two off them were out by 11 30 am. Constant sticky floor. I ordered a bbq bacon burger today, was told they had no bacon "" would you like to add an ingredient? "" It's a bacon burger, I want bacon. If I am eating in, they do have a spacious dining area with rock on the speakers then don't wrap everything up to go.

I used to also love Der Stiftskeller, where you could get great burgers, awesome burritos, and REAL beer cheese soup, not to mention great chili. The recent renovation of the menu in an attempt to conjure a bit of old Germany left the place sadly lacking. I've had far better German food FYI a panini is not German , and can't believe I'm saying this, but I miss the grill and the bar food. n nAnd please, what the heck happened to the beer cheese soup?

"It was my 30th birthday and took my huge group there because I've always trusted yelp not to steer me wrong. We had to leave in the middle because it was THAT bad, we didn't ""boo "" or anything rude. It was not funny. At all. We are very easily entertained, but this was awful. Go to another improv, my husband and I have gone to many others and been entertained , I understand any improv will not always be amazing, but I've never been to one this bad. n nThis venue was nicer than others I've been to, but the talent was just NOT there. It felt like a bunch of high school kids getting together on the weekends who thought they were hilarious to themselves. That's the best way I can describe it. Without my people taking up 2.5 rows, there were about 10 other people there last night. n nSave yourself the 14 and go anywhere else for laughs.

The most horrible consignment store total lack of business sense and mismanaged. nThese young girls including the owner Tiffany have no customer service skills or common sense . Ibelieve the store is for sale no surprise. nIf you call for directions or details expect to get half of the information needed only to learn that they are not accepting your type of items when you trek down to the store. Example I have baby items what time can I bring them into the store. We accept items until 4pm. Show up don't be greeted be asked by three different dizz balls if you filled out a form. Wait in line and be told Oh we are not accepting these items. nManager is rude and has no idea how to run a business. I miss SMALL CHANGE ! I would add that when I called the other independently owned store near Dessert Ridge I had a very different experience. If you are looking to buy this store save your money Im sure they have turned off the majority of potential customers.,1
"I was so excited to see this open as I was a regular at Chestnut Lane and I live in the neighborhood, so today I decided to visit. First of all, not same owner. So I stayed and ordered a 9.00 egg salad sandwich.bread a little hard. But the kicker was the 6.00 ""Lavender Honey "" coffee. I take responsibility of not knowing how much drink was as I looked at the menu board and not the actual menu. When I questioned the cost .I was told well it is served in a large cup. Yes it is, and I got maybe 6oz watery coffee with pretty foam . If you are going to charge 6.00 for a coffee latte whatever don't serve it in a 20 oz cup. And I do know it is a 20 oz. cup. I went home with my big cup tiny drink and brewed a cup with my Keurig.still tasted watery. I was told 2 different stories about the drink. The owner I think offered to refund me my money. I did not take it. I won't be back. You don't need my money or business.",1
"The name is a bit misleading. Technically, there's water and this area is located adjacent to it. However, it doesn't deliver on the goods for people, like me, who are accustomed to a different setting when they see hear ""waterfront "" in a name. n nDespite the misleading moniker, this area is still pretty cool at times. There's a ton of special event.festivals, outdoor shopping tents, and random celebrations. I like how they're trying to do something different. Sometimes I think Scottsdale gets stuck in it's ""old ways "" and at least this area will try something out of the ordinary and make it interesting. n nIf I were single, I'd live in one of the condos nearby and have great walking access to all of Old Town. If it wasn't for the name, I'd give it 3 Stars.

"I have dined at Elements roughly half a dozen times now, and they always offer fine cuisine done right. Combinations are simple, yet delicate, offering robust flavors with beautiful presentation. In my opinion, their charcuterie is one of the best in the city, though I have not yet been to Cure. My most recent trip to Elements was on a Tuesday night, having dinner before a show at The Cabaret Theater. n nMy date and I were both very pleased with our meals. My date had scallops atop a black bean cake. The scallops were tender and buttery, and the black bean cake was infused with cumin, cilantro, and a warm bite. I had seared tuna, which was cooked to perfection. The accompanying rice cake with ponzu sauce offered a nice crunch that contrasted the softness of the tuna. n nThe ever gracious host came around not once, but twice to ask us if we enjoyed our food and if he could do anything for us. The live music was a nice touch. Well done.",2
"Came here looking for meat and nothing but. Ended leaving with 3 bags of really fresh vegetables, 5 1 inch thick porterhouse, 2 flank steaks and 3 Delmonico cutes. n nTo start off, the vegetables were beautiful and fresh. I picked up some bell peppers, poblano peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, and asparagus. All thrown into a hobo pack which turned out to be one of my top 10. n nThe meat was the star. They had a decent selection. Its not nearly as diverse as Pino's in NYC. I wanted to get a solid necktie but they were out of skirt. This is my one main point of contention with this place. Its Friday afternoon, have the 1 griller available. To compensate I took home the flank. Good, but no skirt. I went with the porterhouse too as its a crowd pleaser without breaking the bank. The steaks were thick, juicy and perfect for the bbq. n nMcGinnis Sisters did have a fine looking poultry and fish section, along with pork and lamb, but I was dead set on the beef. Good job, McGinnis.",2
"I'll admit, normally I just go there for beers which are most excellent but I decided to eat there twice in the last few weeks. Both times, I couldn't believe the food. Having eaten too much bar food in my life, I think I am finally growing up. n nThe first time I was with a group of friends visiting from Las Vegas, and we pretty much worked the appetizers pizzas. The food was great, and everyone really enjoyed it . n nThe second time I went, I happened to be eating alone and had the chef's special some fish . Fish is easy to screw up and difficult to master, but this was one of the best pieces of fish I have ever eaten. n nIn both cases I went, the service, music some sweet 80's 90's jams were playing food were amazing, not to mention the beer. Nothing compares to a glass of the pumpkin porter. n nIf you are looking for a good hearty meal, go there. I've never had a bad beer or meal there.",2
"Dang you Vegas. Even off the strip you're awesome. Why can't there be awesome places like this in San Jose! They have tried miserably and failed. n nBoyfriend said this is a place where a lot of the locals go. And with good reason! It was poppin on the Saturday night that I graced Blue Martini with my prescense. LOL. n nIt was much bigger than I expected. I always pass by it but never realized how big it was. There's a nice outdoor area, nice bar areas, and a super crowded dance floor. Although it was crowded, everyone was having sweaty fun! n nThe only thing I hate. the trance techno house music that comes on around closing time. Sorry all you trance techno house music lovers. Just not my preference. n nThe drinks were good. I got an AMF. Strong. Not so tasty.

For me it was just another place to get a 15 burger, and there are more then enough of them in Vegas. n nHowever, I was surprised at how quickly we were able to get a seat and how good the service was. My drink was never empty, the food came out quick and my order was correct. n nI wanted to try something a little different and was feeling a little more adventurous thanks alcohol! , so I went with the Tex Mex Burger. Basically its a chili burger and it was awesome! A little messy but that is to be expected with an awesomely overloaded burger. n nMy wife was kind enough to share some of her BLT burger which was equally as good as mine.

"Henry Vilas Zoo is the perfect size for a place like Madison. It has a little of everything birds, fish, bears, marsupials, amphibians, giraffes, primates, otters, seals, etc.you won't be disappointed by the variety. I grew up with the Milwaukee Zoo, and I still find the Vilas Zoo to be quite satisfactory. I give it a four because I do believe some of the exhibits are a bit too small for the animals. I know that the zoo does the best with the funds they have, being a free zoo and all. Consider donating a small amount when you go, or plan to buy your lunch there as an alternative to donating. To be honest, some of the food, like the corn dogs and fries, is quite bad, but there is a cart that sells some grilled food and salads I would personally opt for this option if you decide to eat in. There is a wonderful play area for kids with a tree house area and carousel, and an educational building as well.",2
"I went for the gelato, and I was impressed with the imaginative flavors red velvet cake. . I had pistachio, and my friend L.C. had cookies and cream.

The barista gelato schlepper his description seemed to be on his game and the coffee aroma was tempting. n nThe other reviews mentioned the chain pizza rumpus room rehab center picnic area decor. Yes, it's all true. With the power supplies for laptops above table level, the place also looks like the ship in The Matrix. n nBTW, the gelato end of the business is called Monster Gelato. Monster must be the name of a cat, as one scoop is called a ""kitty "" or maybe ""kitten "" and the larger portions are identified as cat sizes. The place is eccentric but definitely independent!",2
"I really want to give this place a 5 star rating, but quite honestly, the service is pretty bad. I went last night for the second time, and the guy came out right away with water for me and my husband and our dogs, who we had with us. Yes, it's dog friendly! But then we ordered drinks really good sangria and mojitos, and I don't say that about very many places. And we had to wait forever for the drinks. nThen my sisters met us, and she had to ask three times for an ashtray. The food took forever, and the guys didn't come check on us nearly enough to the point that we were ordering two drinks a piece at a time. nThe servers are really nice, just not very on top of things. The food is awesome. My husband is a VERY picky eater, and he LOVES their reuben. They have lots of veggie options. The Farrago Lavosh is great, as is the Tuna Melt I highly recommend the tuna melt. nOverall, this place is outstanding, chill, fun and great for a casual group night just be prepared to wait.",2
"If you like hummus, then this is the place for you. Super casual, Pita Jungle has a good mix of young and old patrons. On any given day you'll see students, executives and seniors. The ambiance is uber casual with concrete floors, upbeat music, and an outdoor patio. The servers are young and some look like they just came in from the pool! That doesn't mean the service is bad, exactly opposite. I have had good service every time I've gone in there. The menu is varied including hummus with chicken, lentil soup, pizzas, pita sandwiches, Greek salads and on and on. They also have a thirst quenching Arnold Palmer lemonade and iced tea. They are generous with their portions and are always cool with giving you a ""to go "" cup drink. Almost a necessity in Arizona summer 100 degree temps! Don't forget to try the baklava and pistachio ice cream for dessert.Yum! if you are looking for good food in a casual environment then this place is for you.",2

To take advantage of the coupon, check in and BAM! Coupon appears. I love it when that happens. n n2 The frozen yogurt is good! There are a lot of selections both of the fruit and confectionery varieties and the flavors are very tasty. I didn't like it as much because I realized I'm more of a sorbet girl. But on that note, they have one super tasty ""country lemonade "" sorbet available. n n3 It's hard to beat the location. Plus, the outdoor seating is just perfect on a chilly, rainy Phoenix evening.

"I really enjoyed the amazing environment at MCN. Cookies and water with fruit infusion at the entrance and a kind, sweet receptionist to introduce me to the place set the perfect tone. The receptionist is new so it sounds like the owners are actually listening to the complaints regarding the previous staff in this area. n nMy appt with Lacey was great. I talked with her about color options and products to make my curly hair tame and straight. She gave great suggestions and my blow out was definitely runway pretty. n nA few things though price is definitely even more steep than Capristo. Unfortunately, though my hair looked amazing, it definitely took her a lot longer to blow me out and I have grown accustomed to Kim's speedy blowouts at Capristo. n nIn conclusion, the ambiance is WAY better at mcn and I am def considering returning if I still can't achieve the ombre color I want with Kim.

These kind of rescues are what is saving the lives of so many animals. n nI also read the negative treadmill comment and that is just ignorant.

"Went here for the first time with a girlfriend recently. I had a Groupon that was expiring and thought this would be a great place to start our day. I was right! We got there about quarter to noon and there was a little bit of line, but it gave us time to decide what we wanted and peruse the goodies in the store. I selected the chicken fajita wrap and the gf had the tuscan chicken sandwich. Both were delicious. The fajita chicken with the black beans and guacamole was just what my taste buds were craving. I ate every single bite of that yumminess! The chocolate raspberry bar from the pastry selections was delicious as well. They have a couple flavors of fresh brewed iced teas and a fresh lemonade that were very good too. Its slightly pricey at around 9 10 bucks for a sandwich with no sides, but the ingredients are fresh and the its a nice setting to enjoy lunch. I look forward to trying another yummy menu selection in the future!",2
"I have been to Hong Kong many times but this is my first review. I must say every time I go, my belief that this is the best buffet in the Phoenix area is reaffirmed. Hong Kong is very consistent with their food quality and the service is always been excellent. I do agree with other Yelpers that you can find other buffets that are cheaper but you get what you pay for. My favorite feature is the sushi station. My wife is not a sushi fan so when we go to Hong Kong, I hit this station several times. The only problem is if I fill up on the various rolls and sushi pieces, I don't have room for all of the other wonderful items Hong Kong prepares. The only station I can't comment on is the Mongolian BBQ station. Again, it comes down to a lack of room more than a lack of will to try it. Oh well, maybe with my next visit I will make an effort to try it. n nIf you are looking for a great Chinese Mongolian Sushi buffet, this place should be number one on your list.",2
"This place is next door to our hotel and since our hotel doesn't include breakfast and we slept late today, we ate lunch brunch at China Buffet. We're incredulous about the negative reviews, since our experience was quite the opposite. Firstly, everything was very clean and the food was quite fresh. Secondly, the selection of food was terrific really impressive when compared to other Chinese buffets and it included a big variety of sushi, too. Thirdly everyone working there was very pleasant, plus our server i.e., he brought refilled our water glasses and he cleared our plates between visits to the buffet was very attentive. In addition, the interior of the restaurant is very attractive and spacious. n n Update on 4 14 14 We also ate lunch brunch there today and it was another very positive experience. The cost is much less on weekdays 8.99 vs. 12.99, although even 12.99 is a bargain for the amount of delicious food . The hostess recognized us, and she our server were very sweet.",2
"I went to Vegas this past week with my daughter and my friend and her daughter, both girls were celebrating their 21st b day. We made reservations at this old school old Vegas steak house and man was I IMPRESSED!

"04 21 10 n nMet up w a friend for coffee and a pastry. Well, I had coffee and a pastry I think she had a pizza. LOVED the cafe latte! I don't really care for too much foam, and this cup was absolutely perfect! I usually order coffee w out sugar so that I may also enjoy a sweet complement. Today's pairing was a cherry scone. The piece I tried had a pleasing to the eye golden color to it, as well as a few lovely looking cherries. Wished there were more in the batter those cherries you see on the edges were pretty much the only ones I had the middle was almost void of any! . I originally had turned down the accompanying homemade whipped cream sweetened w powdered sugar , but the scone was, as is usually par for the course, a bit dry don't forget sorely lacking enough cherries! and needed something extra. If you're ever offered their homemade whipped cream, you better ask for extra it's wonderful! n nI may not get another scone, but I'll definitely be back for more coffee!",2
"Delicious food definitely french influenced, with just the right amount of spice. The fact that it's BYOB is a huge plus, as these types of restaurants are usually just so much better. They can't make money on their 350 markup of alcohol, so they really have to do well with the food. This restaurant did not disappoint, both in service and taste. n nThe inside is very small which makes this a pretty intimate place. My girlfriend and I were clearly having a date night, but there was a row of tables lined up next to us that was set out for a large party. It's nice when a restaurant can be small enough to have an intimate atmosphere, yet still accommodate a large range of group sizes. I had the prix fixe menu, which was a LOT of food so the price tag wasn't unreasonable at all , and every portion of it was delicious. n nIf you're visiting Montreal, GO TO THIS PLACE. If you live in Montreal, I am supremely jealous.",2
"Hands down the best Thai in Charlotte. I have had the red curry and the darn i cant spell it Massuman curry here along with the chicken satay. The chicken satay appetizer is served with a thick peanutty sauce and a great side of cucumber and onion mixed with a sweet sauce. To die for! n nThe red curry is the best I have ever had in my life. Um ok I have never been to Thailand.just getting that out there. It comes with a side of rice. The Massuman curry is like other places like Monsoon but a touch better because the sauce is thicker. The owner says she uses a 90 10 split coconut milk to water ratio instead of the usual 50 50. n nIt is a TAD pricey, you can easily spend 16 bucks for lunch and have just enough food but it is worth it. n nI didnt give it five stars because Jesus Mary and Joseph it is so far away! And the decor of the place is a little McDonalds y with Thai touches. But the food and service are great! Love you Siam Garden!",2
"This is as lovely of a bookstore as you could hope to find anywhere. The staff is passionate, friendly, knowledgeable and professional. The store is quite large and carries a well organized mix of new and used books, greeting cards, notebooks, gifts, etc. There is even a great cafe! n nMy favorite thing about it is that the used books are actually shelved next to the new ones so that you can decide for yourself if you want to spend 15 or 7.50 for the exact same book. Most used book stores keep the used books piled up like rummage sale merchandise and I never have the patience to go through them. Changing Hands doesn't treat its used books like 2nd class citizens, and it makes for a really enjoyable and affordable shopping experience. n nBottom line, if you're lucky enough to live near this lovely independent bookstore I hope that you will give them your patronage before hitting up a Barnes Noble or a Borders.",2
"I've had a meal or five at Mr. K's, and you definitely have to experience the place to believe it. While Charlotte has a tendency to tear down anything more than a few years old, Mr. K's has managed to survive for decades. n nAlong with places like Price's and Zack's, they are perhaps the best place to find Charlotte's soul for food. Nothing fancy, just a good meal at a decent price. n nUnfortunately, Charlotte is much more interested in creating vacant lots and building new and better on top of whatever was there before. You will find some good food being made here and there, but generally you end up with just another franchise being put up over and over again. n nMr. K's is definitely different Family owned and run. You'll want to make sure that you pay attention to the hours, especially on the weekends. Don't go on Saturday night expecting to get a treat for example one mistake that I've made more than once!",2
"Went back to Oyshi last Monday and the place was packed. A Little surprised but expected knowing this place is pretty popular. Anyway, did the AYCE again, but I ordered the Kami Kaze and NYI rolls. Word of warning, these things were HUGE. I thought the AYCE portions suppose to be smaller than the regular order. If this is smaller order, I'm afraid to ask what their regular size would be. These two rolls came out near the end of our meals and we were kinda full by that time already, so trying to stuff those two rolls down was a challenge. Next time, I won't order this roll unless I have 2 or 3 people to split it with. Anyway, the reason I reduced one star on this trip is that the sushi wasn't as fresh as my previous trip there. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional fresh either. I heard from some review, not sure if it's for Oyshi or Kobe, that it might be due to the fact that fish delivery comes on Tue, Thu and Sat.",2
"Most important message go at the in between times right before they switch over to dinner so you pay lunch prices and get dinner options. 20 for lunch. n nSince the Rio buffet is the first buffet I remember going to in Vegas, I always compare others to it. I'm surprised that the selection is bigger, since Vegas is the city of excessiveness. There is a large variety of foods, salads, seafood, meat, pasta, desserts, and everything in between. n nMmmm.king crab legs. Saltier and smaller than the Wynn, but still good. At least they crack them for you. They had the best salmon and ahi poke that I could have devoured a whole plate of. Fresh seafood! n nThe desserts were ok, I thought there would be more and that they would be yummier, but after eating all that I did, I didn't really need dessert anyway. n nAnd our server was on top of refilling our iced teas. n nOverall, Bellagio was really good, but I think I prefer the Wynn buffet because the quality of the food is better.",2
"The only place where I can get my taco fix while I'm in Pittsburgh? Legit. I always get two lengua tacos. Lengua is Spanish for delicious, so that's why I always get two lenguas because that's double the awesome lengua is actually Spanish for tongue, but I find lengua makes for some of the best tacos super savory and always tender . n nTake a fresh tortilla, warm it up on the grill, and top it with a pile on the lengua. Yes, onions, cilantro and a squeeze of a lime wedge would be preferred, but I guess the Pittsburgh market prefers the lettuce tomato with sour cream deal. The customer is always right. n nAt 2 5, it's a bit pricier than what I'd expect a taco to cost elsewhere, but in Pittsburgh competing with other food vendors in the Strip, it's priced just right. n nThey also do chicken, pork and beef tacos as well as burritos 5 as well , but if you're in the mood for awesome, do yourself a favor and get some LENGUAAAA.",2
"I never thought the day would come when I'd be writing a review about fast food. n nHere is the deal, this Jack in the Box is right next to my work and I happen to be a big fan of their iced coffee. I stop in every morning to get it and if I don't my day just isn't right. n nI am not a fast food person so all I can comment on is the iced coffee and the service. I have created a following at work, my coworkers are now addicted to the iced coffee as well. It actually tastes like coffee and you don't feel sick to your stomach after drinking it. n nThe service.this place is always busy and they are quick and efficient and the staff always has smiles on their face. n nSpecial shout out to Perla, who is a sweetheart and I can tell is going places. She always asks how my day is and has excellent customer service skills. She can't help but make you smile! n nI would give them five stars but out of principle I simply can not.it is a fast food place after all! ",2
"Perfection. n nThis is THE best cafe in town for several reasons. Not only do they have pastries that look and taste like they come from a renowned patisserie, but their coffee isn't as expensive as chains like Starbucks or other popular cafes like It's A Grind. n nThe spring season is the best time to be there because the whole plaza has outdoor seating. If you want the whole European feel of cobblestone streets, soft lights and mild conversations, this is the best place in Vegas for it. n nIn the inside, the cafe is two stories with sofa seating and a flat screen tv, overlooking downstairs like a balcony. They also have a long table with numerous power outlets for those on laptops. Internet card is provided for those who make a purchase. n nOccasionally, they will have someone singing and playing guitar. No worries, its not some stoned idiot its someone who knows what they're doing. n nOh, and they sell macaroons. This place is flawless for a date.",2
"I came to the store a few mins before they opened. Waiting outside with a fever other people, the man who im assuming was a manager was extremely friendly when he opened the doors greeted everyone individually. After wandering the store in a hurry and like a lost puppy, the same man was walking around the store instantly asked if I needed assistance. I eagerly accepted his offer for help and he led me straight to the fondant cake section. After showing me he didnt just walk away, instead he asked what I was making, if I needed anything else, what color I was looking for, ect. I was in a hurry so I hustled over to the checkout counter where the girl was friendly and offered to give me a coupon as well. After that as I was leaving the manager jokingly said to bring in pics of the cake I was designing, which was just a friendly way to make me feel personalized at the store, not just a once in a while customer. Great service organized stock.",2
"I love Sam's Town. n nI've stayed here three separate years for Punk Rock Bowling and whenever we're away, I miss it. n nThe drinks are well priced and I love the theme stuff. Plus, the staff have always seemed glad to have us back which counts for a lot . n nThe best thing about Sam's Town, by far, is the atrium. The rock bar was always a central place for you to meet with your friends and close out the night. Besides, where else can you find a bunch of punks singing along to patriotic sings and climbing on animatronic wolves and bears? n nAs gross as it sounds, I actually like that they have the little fast food section too. It's all together and if you just want something quick and disgusting, you know just where to go. n nThe bowling center is great until your lane breaks during the tournament but, honestly, that just added to the awesome crappiness of it all. n nSo, Sam's Town, I miss you but at least we still have bowling.",2
"Appetizers I was lucky enough to try n nWagyu filet tartare So tasty. Exactly how you'd want a tartare to be. It announced itself, then slid effortlessly down my throat. Nice. n nMaine lobster fritters That Meyer lemon creme fraiche is really what sends these over the top. Cannot recommend enough. n nTrio of duck fat fries These things didn't need any sauce. They were absolutely perfect as is. This is how all potatoes should aspire to end their lives. The epitome of potato deliciousness fully achieved. n nThe American Wagyu rib cap was unbelievable. Those words together probably sound like a big ""duh, "" but it was. Seared beautifully on the outside, perfectly medium rare on the inside.it seriously melted in my mouth. I don't think I've ever had a nicer piece of cow, and I doubt I ever will. Memorable. n nThat truffled mac n' cheese. Omg. That could have been a meal in itself. Instead, it was a fantastic side that we all shared.",2
"From the emotive girly name to the plum coloured fronting, everything about Ruby Shoes lures women in like they're taking the apple from the tree all over again. n nMost women love a good shoe shop, and this one certainly doesn't disappoint many. From ridiculously high heels with pretty little buckles to more form fitting, comfortable yet pretty styles, Ooh Ruby Shoes stocks them all. n nThey seem to bring in a lot of stock from the continent, adding a different dimension of style to the Edinburgh shopaholic. It's the kind of shoe boutique that's well stocked, but shoes are dispersed evenly throughout the store. Less usually means more price, but definitely more quality comes wrapped in as past of the deal. n nI adore heels but this place isn't wacky enough for me. However, there is something in it for everyone and I can see it appealing to a broad age group which is always good. High end, high quality and continental, I see why women like it.",2
"It was the perfect location for what a few friends and I have deemed 20 Tuedsay. This is the same night that they run their all you can eat taco special. n nThey have six choices of meat fillings for said tacos and you can also go with either corn or flour tortillas. You get your first four with a side of rice and refried beans. I would like to just try fried beans once to see if I am wasting my time. Mitch Hedberg n nNow, being of a svelte nature, all you can eat deals are usually wasted on me. But at 7.50, I still felt like I was getting a deal. n nThe food was delicious and the service was great. Not sure if it was the fact that my former Duke linebacker buddy put down about 13 tacos or we were cute guys to the heavily tatted dude serving us, but we even got a free round of Tecate's thrown in there. n nThe only odd thing is the fact that they share both an entrance and bathrooms with CommonHouse next door.",2
"Dayum you Gabi! I had it my mind fuzzy as it has been since Sunday to be the FTR on this event. Well. Who cares! What a fabulous day. It was like seeing family. I saw industry folk, lots of yelpers and so many of my customers and neighbors from the CenPho hood! n nCorn Dogs from District! Seriously. I could eat those babies for breakfast. nGelato from Chelsea's Kitchen!? Seriously I could eat that for breakfast! nSea Scallops with pea risotto from A Different Pointe of View. Yep. Breakfast. Eggs over easy. Done deal. nAnd the wine! The tequila. And the Dragonberry Rum. Yep. Hair of the dog. Breakfast all the way. n nPAM has never looked prettier to me. And by the end of the day. Everyone I saw had never looked prettier to me. Recall the wine, tequila and rum! n nGreat event. GO PHOENIX FOODIES! n nFive stars. Great double date with Rickie, Anton and Dave. n nThe only bad things was the neon green drink band clashed with my black and pink Hello Kitty bracelet. n nHmmm.",2

"We ordered the tiger shrimp appetizer, which was good, but it only came with four shrimps albeit big ones , so that was a bit disappointing. For the entrees, we got the pork tenderloin, which was amazing. Super tender and flavorful, and it came with a yam mash. We also got the rabbit, which was surprisingly really good, because I was never too fond of rabbit meat. We also got the salmon, which was good not great, and we also got the 22oz steak, which was good, but it didn't come with anything else like mashed potatoes or anything. So having a huge steak with nothing to go with it was kinda not great, so we got a side of spinach, which was pretty good for nothing but spinach. We also got a baked potato, which was super different from your standard baked potato. It was in between mashed and baked, really soft. It had TONS of flavor the flavor of horseradish was a bit strong but it was really good.",2
"My husband and I went to the Smiling Banana Leaf on a tuesday for dinner. We knew this place was BYOB so we took a bottle of wine with us. The very friendly hostess owner sited us and brought us actual wine glasses you'd be surprised what some places that offer BYOB will offer to drink from . nWe had three appetizers Thai Samosas, Chicken Stay and Tofu Paradise. Then my husband had the Seafood Pad Thai and I had the Chef's Specials Prik Poa Talay. The food had a lot of flavor, fresh and crunchy veggies, spicy to your taste. nThe restaurant is small, with only 24 seats. From the outside you wouldn't imagine the warmth of the dinning room there are pillows on the seats up against the wall, candles lit on every table and a beautiful mural on the ceiling. nFinally I have to agree with everyone that the Smiling Banana Leaf has great service, great food and no corkage fee. We'll definitely go back.",2
"Went to a 7pm show with one of my girls for our lady's night and we were definitely in awe the whole time. If you're a Michael Jackson fan, this is the show in Vegas to go to. nIt was slightly different from the other Cirque shows, not as much acrobatics but still a good amount. It had a story line that was easy to follow, lots of lights, tv projections, cool costumes, special effects and of course the infamous moon walk! I was expecting a little more for the ""Thriller "" ensemble but it was still definitely better than anything I could pull off haha. My favorite was their dance for ""smooth criminal "" and there is also a really cool part with the dancers lined in neon lights. I heard some people near me saying that they were expecting more of a main Michael Jackson impersonator, so this is not the show if you want something like that. Overall, I loved this show and if you enjoy Cirque De Soliel as much as I do, I'm sure you'll love it too ",2
"One of the best meals of my life. My friends and I were celebrating in Vegas, and looking for a place to do it up. A 50 bottle of French wine later and the meal we had was filling, hedonistic, awesome, whatever superlative I could give. n nThe appetizers were great I had gumbo, and split barbeque shrimp and butternut squash ravioli with duck confit on top. Portions for apps were not teeny, which was impressive, because honestly I expected it to be. n nThen comes the main course. All four of us split the chateaubriand, which was tender, carved tableside, and delicious. The crust of the steak was delicious as well. Almost as impressive were the side dishes truffle parmesan potato chips and creamed corn Yes, who thought Creamed Corn could emerge from the cafeteria lunch as a DELICIOUS side dish . n nYes, it's expensive it's Vegas. But I was very impressed with the quality. Will gladly go back when I have more .",2
"Why am I reviewing Costco? Because you, dear Yelper, are a perfectionist like me. n nWhere should one go for 20 chicken breasts in a bag for 20? n nWhere should one go for 4 bags of bacon for 7? n nCostco. n nThere are deals people. Just make sure to have enough space in your fridge wto stuff this stuff for the next few weeks months. n nThis is the place where I go to buy 1 2 select things I really need but always end up leaving with 200 300 worth of extra junk. n nI now have enough razors, body gel and deodorant to last me until 2015. n nLadies! How you doin'? n nThis place is huge, it will happen. You will buy extra stuff you'll never need. n nIt gets pretty chaotic and people are generally poor carriage drivers, especially since the ones you use here are Americanized. huuuge! n nI make it a point to visit this place 4 5 months before a holiday, because if you're here in August, they'll be selling things for Christmas.",2
"My 4 stars are solely based on my experience with the stylist Erin the shampoo guy . If I had to rate my experience when I came for a ""FREE consultation "" with Lisa I would rate the salon a 2 1 2 stars all the stars are because of the look of the salon which is approachable appreciated and the missing 2 1 2 have to do with the service provided by Lisa which was rushed, interpersonal sorta rude didn't influence my decision to try the salon. The best thing that Lisa did was walk me into the suite where Erin was located her welcoming demeanor customer service are the only reasons I returned. n nNow back to 4 Stars for Erin. As a stylist a personable person Erin is an amazing and as a natural hair enthusiastic I would greatly refer them to Styles By Lisa SOLEY to go see Erin. My twist ups are the truth she is great with timing as I'm very inpatient if u have an appointment I expect to be seen at that time not be at the salon all day night. Best believe you will get in out with Erin.",2
"I can't comment on the whole array of doughnuts, since I had a quick visit more for a look around near the end of the day and only bought doughnut holes 1.59 doz. . But as far as holes go, they were top notch and those I shared them with thought they were great and tasted fresh even though it was nearly 8 pm. n nOverall, Golden Donuts looks promising. Regular specialty doughnuts are 0.89 and 1.29 respectively. An assorted dozen is 9. I didn't notice anything particularly unique about the selection though, so I'll have to go back and look harder they'll need something to differentiate themselves from cheaper doughnuts at Albertson's across the street . n nThere seemed to be plenty of seating, but I had zero desire to spend time there since the place feels a little too sanitized and clinical right now. I know it's new, but they really need to dress the place up. n nSo a good start overall. I'll be back to try some different varieties and make a better assessment.",2
"My family and I have been coming to Lush Burger often over the past few months. Our experience overall has been great. The servers are friendly, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the food is consistent. n nThe lunch special is 2 dollars plus the price of the burger you order. I usually get the Lushburger classic normally 8 with sweet potato fries and an iced tea. I like my hamburgers medium to medium well, and Lushburger delivers. The sweet potato fries are fantastic, and you can get the iced tea in a giant to go cup to take with you after you leave. So for 10 I get a great meal. Sometimes my mom and I even split it. n nYes, the burger is pricey. But in North Scottsdale, it's pretty hard to get a lunch under 10 that isn't Subway or In N Out. And you can only eat at AJ's and Wildflower so many times. I tried the new BluBurger location at the Summit North Scottsdale and Lone Mountain but was not impressed. Around the same price but the atmosphere and quality was lacking.",2
"The resturant was beautiful, food was amazing and delivered pretty fast, and the service was perfect. nMy boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I could not have been happier. Our waitress I feel bad for not remembering her name was so plesant, and attentive. I told her I had to eat gluten free and she made sure they could accomidate me perfectly. We started off with an appetizer, but before she brought that out, she brought us bread and for me gluten free pita chips and salsa. Our appetizer was the house fries which were amazing. I had a chicken dish for my entre and my boyfriend had pork. They were both absolutely delicious, I had to force myself to eat slow so I could appreciate it. For dessert the chef surprised me with the most savory flan I have ever had in my life. nGreat, now I'm craving the food. Needless to say, this resturant is worth every penny, I would reccommend it to anyone for any occasion.",2
"I love Japanese food and Teppanyaki cooking. n nThat being said, while Benihana isn't my favorite place to go for this, you'll still find good food and a fun experience. n nMost recently, I was here with my family for my Dad's birthday. n nWe had the pleasure of having Sam as our cook, and he put on one heck of a show. n nYou start with a mushroom and onion soup, green salad with a tasty ginger dressing, and some shrimp with grilled veggies. n nI ordered the Terriyaki Chicken, and it was decent. n nThe only reason I'm giving these guys the fourth star is because my mother found a staple or part of a pair of tongs in her salad, and the manager was kind enough to comp her meal and beverages. n nLastly, don't forget to sign up for the Benihana Chef's Table Club. 30 for your birthday say what?! n nLike I said, there's many other places that come to mind when I hear the word Teppanyaki, but Benihana can be a lot of fun for any special occasion.",2
"I often forget how big of a fan I am of this place until some random Thursday night when I'm looking for a classic place to eat something fresh and guaranteed yummy. Then I remember of all those late night after work snacks I've had and enjoyed there. n nThis is the perfect little bistro. Well located, cute setup, and fun affordable wines for you to try. I think they've narrowed down their food menu lately, but the good news is, they kept the best dishes. n nSo the beef carpaccio with manchego and the salmon tartar with avocado puree are great. BUT make sure you order the fig carpaccio served hot with goat cheese and the most amazing creamy pesto and balsamic sauce ever. Everything on the menu will be good, but keep your focus on the fig carpaccio it will be AMAZING. n nI will admit that the bill can get a little high but the food is delicious and worth it. Plus, they're open late and have a cute yet tight terrace. n nYou should go!'",2
"We've been here many times since they opened. Every time has been a good experience. We really like the atmosphere and the food is excellent. We have our favorites, but we like to try everything on the menu. We have had several servers and they treat us very well. The Manager is a bit full of himself. He knows we are regulars, but never gives us the attention he does the other people that have been there several times. That kind of bothers us, but now we just ignore him and enjoy our time there. We don't come to see him anyways! We come for the food! We like the happy hour much better then Applebees. Much better crowd of people and better food. n nOne thing that makes us laugh is the amount of people that can't get over the fact that it is no longer Caballero Grill. I hear people asking if they can use their gift cards there. It's not the same restaurant or people! It's a much better restaurant, much better service, and better place all around.",2
"I like the cupcakes. A lot. nAnd I'm not really a cupcake fan not that I dislike them either, they're just not in the top 3 of my dessert list n nI digress n nThis last time that I was in here, I got two strawberry cupcakes the cake was moist, delicious and had the taste of fresh strawberries. n nThere was too much frosting, sounds like sacrilege I know, but the frosting is very thick, tastes a little like shortening weird because the flavor of the strawberry is so light. BUT when I took half of the frosting off and smoothed the rest onto the cupcake, it was JUST the right amount of yum! n nThe sign outside doesn't say Ollie Cakes, that is just the cupcake counter inside, it says ""URBAN "" on the outside, which was tricky for me because I'm new to the area and didn't know exactly where I was going. n nI would definitely go back, the staff was friendly, the cake in the cupcake was deeeelish, and it just tasted like awesome all over my mouth. n nBAM. Get at it.",2
"Not sure how to follow Julie P.'s epic review, but I thought I'd show some support. n nLa Condesa is a fantastic addition to Central Phoenix. Casual, nice people, amazing food. n nLike other reviewers, I'm partial to the Oaxaca black mole chicken and the cochinita pibil. Everything is delicious in any delivery system taco, burro, or gooey and vaguely depraved quesa. n nThe salsa bar really gets me, though. Experiencing it is to suffer total cognitive arrest and disorganization it's like love at first sight or stumbling upon a work of great art. Peanut, cilantro, de arbol. bring a sharpie so you can mark the little plastic cups and remember your favorites. n nBonus points The server remembered that I'd asked for strawberry salsa they were out on my last visit eight days prior, and offered a totally above and beyond apology. Must be something in the mole that sharpens the memory. n nGreat place a gem.",2
"I came up for the farmer's market but saw the many recommendations for here. Definitely worth it to come here! There is a parking garage nearby if you can't find parking at a meter. Although there may seem to be a considerable line, there are 2 order takers who do a pretty good job. n nThen you have to find a table if you're not taking it to go. When it gets full, there is a side waiting area where servers then help find you a table. They always have a few specials mentioned on the big board, but I stick with some of the regulars. The duck confit hash is great. They use chunks of duck and their potatoes to create a solid breakfast meal along with your choice of eggs and a side salad. The breakfast sandwich is pretty good as well since they toast their ciabatta bread. It's a hearty start to the day. The only drawback is that it can be pretty busy so it does take some time for orders to be filled and it's a little crowded inside. Otherwise, a great option for brunch!",2
