"We had three reservations from the Bellagio Hotel to the Las Vegas aiport. The service was fine as the car showed up on time, was clean and the driver was courteous. It was not until my mother checked her credit card statement a few days later she noticed an additional charge for 2,176 from CLS Transportation. My mom emailed back and forth with Christina a few times, and she was unapologetic and offered no explanation as to how her card was overcharged by more than 2000. Eventually the money was refunded, but we still have no idea why we were overcharged by so much. We didn't find the service to be at all cost effective either. We were heading to the aiport during a busy time on a busy weekend which was why we arranged for the cars instead of just taking taxis. We had three separate cars going the 15 minutes from the Bellagio to the airpor that cost 90, 61 and 71 respectively.",1
"I wish I was exaggerating. I'm usually a very passive person, and a push over. But this post office, its attendants, and it's carriers have caused me, my family, and my neighborhood so much grief over the past year. I always looked at post office employees as respectable, reliable people. But because of the gross negligent and disastrous mistakes,their poor apathetic and rude attitudes on every possible experience, that image is tarnished. I see criminals. I dread the idea if anything sensitive or important passing through their hands. How can a place so corrupt get away with what they do. I hope that others will come forward as well and join me in reporting them to the Us postal service corporate office headquarters. So many other things in life to be vigilant about. The mail does not need to be in that list. They should be ashamed.",1
Same experience I had with Koraku at Primm Valley. The food here was totally inedible and ridiculously pricey. Everything is double from the price at L.A but the quality is ten times worse than any Sam Woo or equivalent at L.A. The lunch special char siu with rice was a joke. It tasted and looked like the char siu from Manchus Wok or Chinatown Express with red purple dye penetrated down into the interior of the pork . The color of the interior was dark instead of white that a good char siu pork supposed to be. I feel sorry for the local Chinese who have to come to this place to satisfy their need for comfort food. Honestly the quality of this place cannot survive in bay area or southern California at any moment. Whoever doing the cooking in kitchen must be those unwanted from California who have to make its way to Vegas to make ends meet.,1
"This place has ruin its reputation faster than Tiger Woods. When I came here a while back, I remember reviews being positive but I had my doubts. n nAfter tasting the pho, I knew I had good reasons to be doubtful. The broth and noodles were flavorless. The only saving grace was the rest of the ingredients were acceptable and my Pho did come out hot. n nThe only way you can have worse service than an Asian restaurant is not even executing the simplest request. I asked the water 3 times till I finally got my first cup of water. Water or some other drink should be given when you sit down with your menu. The waiter just couldn't remember a cup of water, and there was only 2 other small groups in the restaurant. I'm surprised he actually got the right order. n nThere are a bunch of other places on Spring Mountain, try one of those instead.",1
"I was excited to see a new home cooking restaurant open in S. Chandler, as we need something that is affordable and not a chain. This restaurant is in the old Native New Yorker spot in the Safeway center. n nI first ordered the chicken pot pie, which was marked as a specialty, but I was informed that ""they weren't serving that yet. "" Instead I selected the chicken fried steak. The portions were large, but the meat patties were frozen, not fresh, and had some weird seasoning that I didn't care for. I would say it's on par with Denny's, and not something I was happy paying 9.50 for. n nFor dessert I selected the French Silk pie, which they were also out of. The German chocolate pie had a beautiful meringue top and was very good. n nI'd go back for a slice of pie, but won't be eating a meal there again.",1
"Since this cafe is open 24 hours, we ended up here after trying to hit up club Mix. There was no wait for a table, thank goodness, and the server took our order right away. Food came in a timely manner, and yes, it was definitely tasty. We ordered cheeseburgers and club sandwiches with fries. Manager on duty came over to the table and harassed us a little bit, saying we had to keep it down because we were too loud. OK really? There were only 4 of us, and there were bigger parties sitting around us being way louder! WTF? She came back a second time to be a jerk just because one of us had asked for mayonnaise, not knowing it was right in front of him. I don't know, maybe she thought he was being a smart ass about it? Whatever. Totally rude and unprofessional. Our server was GREAT and even though his boss was a d we left him with a good tip.",1
"Wow. Thanks to my father I was able to find this hidden treasure. I love good Mexican food and the meal started out strong with great chips and salsa and guac. Service was good and one of the few bright spots. Then it was downhill. Food came out so fast and the meats lacked flavor or the ability to chew without hurting your jaw. Normally we take leftovers but I didn't want to put myself through any more pain. Just like a std, bad food goes home with you too and boy did it ever. Listening to the symphony coming out of my dear little brothers butt was music to my ears. I felt like I gave birth as I sat down on the porcelain praying that this would end. I feel bad because it does have potential, just needs to combine its service to it food. Fresh is important even at low prices. I woke up this morning with a hangover but ended the day with excrutiating indigestion.",1
"And shame on me for letting them ""not show up "" twice. I missed 4 hours of work total sitting home waiting 3 hours the first time and 1 hour the second time . n nAfter the first time July , the owner Carrie , apologized up and down once I finally got a hold of her , put me on the schedule for another day August and said ""I will personally be there to do your house and will call and confirm the day before. "" n nWell, I should have known when I didn't get the confirmation call and I couldn't reach her the day before. But, I waited home anyway. n nI'm so furious. Living Social is working to resolve the problem and hopefully I can get some kind of credit. I hope everyone on these reviews has contacted them so they have records of the problem. n nP.S. The day before my first appointment I also received a ""redeemed "" message and ""How did it go? "" Unbelievable.",1
"This review is based on a selling experience I had just yesterday. I brought in name brand jeans, dresses, jackets, tops and shoes that were never worn most of the clothing wasn't worn either, or very gently used . I don't know who these ""buyers "" think they are, but they are extremely rude and picky to the point of why bother asking people to bring clothes in?! A brand new White House Black Market dress, never worn was turned away because, ""We have so many dresses already, we have to make a profit somehow. "" mind you on the phone they specifically asked for DRESSES Its surprising to see how they can make a profit, seeing that most everything in there is ugly, old, and sometimes smelly! To tout yourself as a ""high end boutique thrift store "" is quite frankly a misnomer and a joke. I'm sorry if I was not hip enough to sell there, but just down the street at Trend Traders I was.",1
"We went there on Sunday night. We usually love going to Westgate Center to get a drink and appetizer and window shop a bit before going to the movies. I could not believe how disgusting that place was. The bathroom was so gross! Toilet paper all over the floors, and the mirrors looked like they had not been cleaned in a long time! No paper towels to dry your hands, either. I had to go out to the popcorn area for paper towels! The butter stations were just as bad! They had not been wiped down at all. There was food oil all over the place. I mean, seriously, we are talking a Sunday night when it was dead in there! Employees were standing around talking to each other! I was so turned off by the mess, that I will avoid going to that theatre again. It's a shame, since that is a nice area, with good restaurants and shopping.",1
"I've been here twice. I came here to visit one of my friends when she gave birth. The maternity ward is pretty nice, from what I remember. It's definitely a step up from UMC. n nI was a patient here once. It was after 3 am, I was at The Cave, a gay bar back then, with my then boyfriend. Enter a drunk patron who had been escorted out of the club who then hurled a small boulder at one of the security guards. Only it ricocheted off the guard and into my forehead! Gaping bleeding wounds. I needed stitches. I was in a room at the hospital for about 3 4 hours before I got medical treatment. A male nurse took one look, and muttered something, which I thought was really unprofessional. And why was I waiting for so long if it looked that bad? There were only a few other patients there besides myself. So, that's why I've only been a patient once.",1
I would give 5 STARS to my ultra sound tech who did my ultrasound! She was very knowledgeable and extremely friendly. She talked me through the whole process. She did a great job and deserves to be acknowledged! She is very good at what she does! n nI give the two stars for the disorganization. I filled out the paperwork online early so that I didnt have to do it in the office before my appointment. They didnt have the paperwork on file and I had to refill all of the paperwork out. Plus they could should be a little more friendly at the desk. n nAs for the doctor I saw. I don't even remember her name.She was not that friendly. I'm not sure if I'm just picky because my other OB has great bedside manner and is really friendly or what.All in all I will not be going back to this place hopefully unless it is a necessary referral.,1
"I only gave 1 star because I couldn't give 0. I placed an online order at 5pm tonight and the order said it would be delivered by 6pm. I called at 615 and 640 to find out where it was and was told it would be there soon. I asked if it would be cold since it had taken so long but was told they have 'magic bags' that keep the food hot. Finally delivered at 645, guy told me he's the only one delivering. The magic bags don't work, shocking! My onion rings and calzone were soggy and cold and inedible. Disgusting. nWill not order from this location again, who wants disgusting food? The calzone wasn't even closed all the way on top because it was so greasy. Oh wait but it's ok, because their first thought is to offer me a credit for my next order? No thank you, there will not be a 'next order'. nI like food I can actually eat, and maybe even enjoy!",1
"The beckoning smells from the Thai house have made me want to try this place out for years. A few coworkers were raving about this place so I finally decided to give try it out. nThe decor was festive but very dark. My friend and I were seated really close to the front door, but I didn't mind that too much. We were greeted quickly and our waitress was very kind. The menu was overwhelming and went on for pages. I'm no Thai expert so I was sure what to eat. I thought about the traditional Pad Thai but ended up ordering this eggplant stir fry and a soup. My friend went with the green curry. nOur soup was odd. The broth was very bland. My eggplant wasn't cooked very well and one of the spices dominated the dish. n I'll give the Thai House one more shot, but I'll have to eat a recommended dish.",1
"The owner of this business called My towing company out for his service truck. When we drove 15 miles out to meet him at a specific address. When we arrived, there was already another tow truck there hooking him up! He had actually called multiple services there to see which one would get there the quickest. n When I called him to confront him about it he was totally unremorseful. His excuse was that he was in a hurry and he needed to get his truck towed by any means necessary. I thanked him for wasting my time and money and he gave me a sarcastic remark back. If this guy was willing to waste the money it takes in fuel and time to run a business like mine think of how bad he would treat a customer. nBased on the other reviews of this guy on yelp it doesn't take that much of an imagination.",1
"I stopped here in August when my band was on tour. We decided to busk in the plaza before our show that night, and I needed some food that didn't come from the cooler in our van. Not wanting a huge portion of food and trying to eat healthy, I took a change on a roll of sushi and a seaweed salad. I thought that since I didn't order anything that needed to be cooked, it wouldn't take too long. After waiting for way longer than is necessary to make sushi, they told me they were out of seaweed salad and offered me a replacement or a refund of which I took the latter . Again, I waited a pretty ridiculous amount of time and eventually got my roll. It was tiny, but it tasted alright. Employees were nice. All in all, about what you might expect from a tiny Asian food stand next to the plaza. Probably wouldn't go back.",1
"I had craved for some greasy and fried foods. I figured since I have a coupon and it was near my work let's give SteakenBurger Long Wongs a try. The joint is simple with two TV's on the wall and good amount of tables for the lunch crowd. It wasn't crowded at 1PM. It's probably never crowded. I had ordered a combo regular original philly steak mushrooms with Cheez Whiz 7.24 with sub for mushroom 1.75 extra instead of fries, and small drink 1.75 . I didn't get my mushroom, but got zucchini instead. I didn't realize that they gave me zucchini until I took a bite. As for the sandwich, no flavor at all, just the Cheez Whiz dripping all over. I do give them having good ice teas. The total of my combo was little over 11.00 with tax. Ouch! I am glad that I had a coupon to use. I certainly had better philly steak sandwiches for that price.",1
"Went here for lunch on Wednesday September 24th, restaurant maybe half full at best. n nAt first impression I like the decor, the simplistic look, the colors all in all looks nice, but then you sit down and realize that the furniture is garbage, the chairs are way to small and hard and the tables are to low for even average people. n nThe menu looks good but way overpriced, somewhat to expect for Townsquare but this is bad, however the orders were made for lunch, some sandwiches a burger etc. n n40 minutes later the food comes out and now really makes the point that this is a disaster, now the food is not bad let's make that clear but average at best, combine that with the horrible seating and poor service my conclusion is don't even bother. n nThis is a rare bad review from me in a town with a ton of dining offered, but the experience is so bad that I felt I had to do this.",1
"Ambiance Bright, spacious and quiet. n nFood The food here is just one step above fast food in its quality. The chicken was dry, the pasta sauce although dark and smokey didn't work well for me due to its slightly anise flavor. Everything else here was average fare that wasn't terrible but neither was it remarkable in any way. n nService Polite and efficient. Could have been better, but they might have been understaffed when I was there. No problems for English speakers. n nPrice Cheap. 12 17 per person. n nHassle factor One of the few sit down restaurants open late in the area 11pm most nights. Midnight on Fri Sat, if I recall . No lines, no fuss, easy. n nOverall If you're out late and are looking for something cheap and easy, this place will do. However, you get what you pay for here. Couples not a good idea unless simplicity is your thing. Business lunches dinners I do not recommend.",1
"What the hell happened?! I haven't been in a while, and my choice to have not been back in a while is completely warranted. I know GVR has made some changes within the year taking away beer pong from Quinn's. really? , and maybe Lobby Bar was included in their changes. The times that I had been very giddy to get back to my ""secret bar, "" it was closed. on a Friday Saturday night, well before midnight. They have also taken away their DJ they had previously on Friday and Saturday on Saturday, so now when you go there, it's pin drop quiet. and dead. What benefit have these changes made? I understand that this is ""Lobby "" Bar, which alludes to a bar specifically aimed towards hotel guests, but this is also a bar in a local hang that once catered to the neighborhood. Why have you let me down Lobby Bar, why?",1
"Be careful! Price might not be as advertised! n n We stopped by for martini specials. They have a huge sign 5 martinis, 2 draft beers. Service was good. Food was good as well. Drinks ok. We ordered from the martinis special list and two draft beers. As we were ready to pay and check was not as we thought it was going to be. Martinis 7.50 and 5.00 beers, WTF? I asked the bartender why are martinis 7.50, he says because ""specialty "" martinis are not included on the special. But, they were made with 3 olives, which was the happy hour vodka special. WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME THAT BEFORE? I am not cheap, but i hate when businesses try to take advantage of people. I guess my 40 tip on food wasn't good enough! Anyway, I tried to get answers and no one was willing to help. Too bad but i'm not coming back at all.",1
"Yet, another bar on the Southside that is a reenactment of your Jr. High dance. NO ONE IS DANCING. Is it because the music is a mediocre mix of dance played by someone with a laptop? Not sure. Is it because there are 5 guys for every girl? Who knows. This place doesn't know what it wants to be, I'll give it props for trying to look nice. Must every bar in Pittsburgh have ""the game "" on? What is the point of going out in this city? There is space upstairs for dancing but it is not conducive to dancing. Get someone who will play good music, and turn down the lights. On second thought, this IS the Southside and most people who frequent these bars wouldn't know good dance music if it hit them upside the head. This bar might as well play Lynyrd Skynyrd, AC DC, and Lady GaGa, like every other bar on the SouthSide",1
"We went to Jack's because of the great reviews, but I simply don't know where all these positive vibes are coming from. It's currently located in an industrial area not surprising, but still a bit sketchy , and we were literally the ONLY car in the parking lot other than that of the employees. This was on a Saturday afternoon too, so not exactly a dead time for shopping. n nThe selection was limited, and the saleswoman there did not even notice we had entered until we'd been wandering around for about five minutes. Keep in mind, we were the only customers in the store now I know why. The prices were mediocre not great, but not terrible. I will say this they did have a fantastic art collection on the walls. I might go back for artwork, but with the indifferent sales team and the odd deserted location I would not recommend this store for furniture shopping.",1
"The last 2 times I've been here, I ordered my usual Sierra Turkey and the Mac and cheese. Both times I sit down with my number and wait. And both times I wait some more. I see them bring food to people who got here after me. Finally I go up and ask, and it's like they totally forgot my order. What is it about me? Is it my big blue eyes that are deep and intense like an ocean swell. Whatever it is, I'm losing my patience. n nAnyway, when I finally get my food, my sandwich has no cheese on it! I go up to fix the problem, and lil bro at the counter tries to tell me the Sierra Turkey doesn't come with cheese. Well if that's the case who do I thank for hooking it up the last 20 times I was here? Because a sandwich with meat and lettuce is no sandwich at all. n nAnyway the food is decent, service sucks. n n rant",1
"Please people really? Club is beautiful. 1 star for that. Way overpriced and catered to all the VIP bs. Yeah you're so cool for spending 1,000's on some juice and a bottle of grey goose. The dance floor is not very big for the size of the venue. Waterfall is bigger. What is up with all the clubs playing techno music? It sucks. The drinks are way over priced and the waitress had to have a card prior to bringing us our drinks. Four of us girls were sitting on a bench and were asked to move because it was becoming a VIP sitting area. Nice huh? We just paid 20 cover and bought 100 worth of drinks within 20 minutes of being inside. Get your poor butts up because you are not valued here is how we felt. We will never visit this club again. Or really any of the hyped clubs. It's all bs. Dive bars here we come.",1
"Likes Big, Airy, Plenty of room to park, Adequate spacing between seats, Ability to see the stage even with someone standing in front of you n nDislikes The fact that it is an outdoor venue especially with the unpredictable wind situations in Henderson Las Vegas, Food vendors are not creative and food choices not too interesting, Lax security. n nSound system was average. n nI can't ding the place for this but the crowd at the Sugar Ray Concert on April 29 was rather strange. The 2 couples next to my group were definitely on something and extremely inappropriate. No security personnel seemed to be around to handle the situation. Also, toddlers were at this concert. I find that rather ridiculous. n nI'm not a fan, probably won't rush to be back and have serious misgivings about the crowd control quality at this place.",1
"i love the irony of embracing love and peace for marketing purposes, but espousing the opposite sentiment when being interviewed for newspaper articles. http www.post gazette.com pg 09291 1006134 28.stm n nIt kinda makes the donuts taste bitter. Oh, and Ron, i'm a centrist, ""right to bear., take personal responsibility. "" kinda guy, so don't brush me off as another one of those LGBT radicals trying to keep you down. If your marketing was based on 1950's kitsche, i don't think people would mind you preaching morality nearly as much. seriously, it's the blatantly misrepresentative marketing that especially irks people. n nAnyway, in all honesty the donuts are decent. some of the flavors are downright tasty. i won't knock em. a tasty snack, though probably not the place i'd go when it's my day to buy donuts due to price and size.",1
"We walked into this place last night around 7 30pm and walked out less than 10 minutes later, having never been waited on. It was freezing and oddly very bright in there, not my idea of a cozy wine bar more like a wine or liquor store with seating. There were about 6 other patrons so it wasn't very busy. However, my boyfriend and I stood at the bar, where the bartender was talking to another couple and he never acknowledged us at all. We weren't greeted or invited to find a seat. It seemed really unfriendly and cold, again, more like a liquor store with seating versus a ""spot "" to go hang out and drink wine like the website said. The selection of wine was vast, but I can't comment on any of the selections because we never had the opportunity to drink any. I had high expectations for this place, so it's unfortunate that it turned out this way. Obviously we won't be going back.",1
"La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it can't be all of them. n nI love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary. n nI'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos.",1
"I was seriously underwhelmed by this restaurant. Granted, I was a bit wary to even go here when I heard ""all you can eat sushi "" that almost never goes well but my friends were quite insistent on going. n nTrue to what I expected, there was nothing particularly positive to report about this restaurant. Everything is designed to get you in and out with as little fish in you as they can manage. You are limited to one serving 2 slices of nigiri. I didn't even see an option for sashimi, which is generally the majority of what I eat. All of the rolls were made mostly of rice, with very little filling again, a tactic to fill you up quickly. The rolls were very loose and fell apart easily. What little fish I did actually get was certainly not up to the standards of freshness that I expect. n nOverall, my experience here was only memorable in the fact that I will remember not to return.",1
"It was my first time at TAO beach and I must admit, I was VERY disappointed! The music that they played wasn't as hyped up as it was supposed to be, it smelled like poo the whole entire time, and there weren't a lot of good looking people around! A lot of people there looked like hot messes it's definitely something you see straight out of Jersey Shore! Plus, the pool is so small I am a tiny girl and even I had a hard time trying to squeeze in! n nHowever, regardless of TAO beach, what I can tell you fellow Yelpers is to check pool tanning area outside TAO. People out there are much more friendly, compared to TAO beach, and plus it's more classier! If you are the type that wished that they were a part of the TAO beach party because of the loud hype, you can certainly still party out in the pool area if you are tipsy because it's VEGAS.",1
"I've been to this place twice. n nthe first night I came, I was by myself, and STARVING. n nI was seated right away, and then sat there for 15 minutes with NO ONE approaching me to even offer me water. nNow.the restaurant was busy, but you should never be THAT busy that someone can't come over and offer water. nI left. n nI went back one night with my best friend. Neither of us felt like cooking, so we stopped in. Again, we were seated right away, and waited for about 10 minutes before we were given water and had our orders taken. We almost left again. 10 minutes is too long to wait, even in a busy restaurant. n nThe chili was good. That was really the only stellar part of my meal. nI ordered a burger, and I honestly could have cooked a better one at home. n nFor having mediocre food, and LOUSY service, I don't think that I will EVER go back again.",1
"Anyone who thinks this sushi bar is a five star joint is insane. I'll give it one star for lovely ambiance, and decent service, but TERRIBLE food. n nAmericanized sushi is a crime against humanity. Out of the 35 or so specialty rolls offered, almost all of them were deep fried, soaked in sugary sauce, or drenched in mayo. Ick. Don't you people want to taste your fish? Apparently not. n nFish quality was poor. My squid nigiri was GRILLED for some unknown reason, and swimming in lemon juice. Scallop nigiri was given the same treatment. n nI forget what hand roll I ended up ordering, but it came with so much chili oil on it that grease ran down my chin when i took a bite. n nI will not be back. n nOh yeah, it's also pretty pricey. For what I spent on my dinner there, I could have gone to my favourite all you can eat place Sushi Kaya TWICE. n nDo not bother with this one.",1
"I rarely drink coffee, usually when I'm making a long distance drive. n nBut I've had tea several times at the Smelly Cat. Not bad. Nice too that they gave me more hot water when I was done and I was able to use my tea bag for another cup. n nThe dessert was good as well as the sliced sandwich wraps. n nThe cons n nI once visited on a day that someone's child was allowed free reign. Like, I saw him playing in the seating area then running behind the counter TOUCHING things, no hand washing apparent. n nUm, no. n nOn my last visit which was my LAST visit there was a dog in the shop. Animals are lovely just not in a place where I'm paying to eat. n nAs a former pet owner, I know that even when animals are banned from the kitchen, animal FUR can never be banned from anywhere animals are allowed. n nThe hair floats on the smallest of breezes and deposits itself where ever it happens to land.",1
"Interesting place with a variety of different dishes. n nPrices are cheap, that's for sure, but they're definitely lacking in the flavor profiles of some dishes. n nWe ventured here for lunch and had a Shrimp Wonton Egg Noodle Soup, Hainan Chicken with Rice, Gai Lan with Garlic, and the Curry with Roti. n nThe Shrimp Wonton were OK, but nothing else special about the noodle soup. n nHainan Chicken lacked flavor and was dry. The rice didn't have that great hainan chicken flavor to it and the sauces they gave were just a spicy sauce and what seemed to be the soy sauce chicken marinade. n nThe Gai Lan was good with lots of garlic. n nThe Curry with Roti might have had to be the best dish. n nThey were out of a lot of things, but not going to ding them on that. I'm not sure if they even had the items, it would have changed my mind much.",1
"Well this place is part of the Larry Miller conglomerate of dealers so right there, you should know that it is a terrible place. I didn't know that until I was leaving, otherwise, I never would have even gone in. n nWe were greeted by a French American whom I could barely understand. He brought us inside and showed us the Nissan Cube that was inside the store. Nice, since it was hot, but it wasn't the trim level we had asked about. He made us sit for 10 minutes next to a screaming baby while he talked to his manager. As if the noise from the ScreamMachine and its Breeder companions wasn't enough to give me a headache, he then came back and tried to tell us that we shouldn't want the car in the brown color because we would never find it. He then took us outside and showed us MORE cars that weren't the right ones. What a waste. n nWill never go back there again.",1
"Upon walking in you feel like you are at a flea market restaurant with hodge podge tables and chairs and no air conditioning. The menu was on a chalk board, and the sodas were canned. Don't get me wrong, all of these things can be OK, and even be a draw to the restaurant, but only if the food can back it. Overall, this food did not back it. I had the pulled pork sandwich. The meat was good, but the bun seemed as though it had just been pulled from the bag it was bought at walk mart in. n nNow, there is one thing about this restaurant I enjoyed. The spicy BBQ sauce is out of this world! I covered my sandwich in that and was set! n nMy final verdict is that if you seriously want BBQ and there is nowhere else around to get some, this place will work, however for the money, you could go elsewhere and get a higher quality in a more comfortable setting.",1
"Other than the delicious cheddar biscuits, I find the service horrible and the food way over priced. I ordered the 4 course meal. Soup salad came out pretty quickly. They were OK. Not great not awful. I wasn't even 1 4 of the way through either when the main course showed up. As a former server, there's no excuse for that. You watch the table and drop the order for the rest of the meal to approximately coincide with the customer finishing soup or salad. And they weren't busy. The waitress brought the check before bringing the dessert that is included in the 4 course meal. I had to ask for a refill of tea. The scallops in the linguine were the size of mini marshmallows and poor quality. Sorry, but the cheddar biscuits aren't enough to bring me back. Las Vegas has many excellent choices for seafood and Red Lobster is not one of them.",1
"Usually when you walk into a Chinese restaurant, you expect to order dishes that are meant to share as a family. This place has dishes that were only made for one person. The portions were tiny and the food wasn't great. It tasted like Americanized Chinese food. The service wasn't the best either. The waiters had somewhat of a attitude because my party was big, they decided to be rude. n nNow, onto the incident. I had ordered beef chow fun and what do you know? There was a hair chilling between the noodles, YUCK! I knew it wasn't my hair because I'm a woman with long hair. I had complained to the waiter and it took them a good 20 minutes before coming back to me apologizing and offering me another dish for free. n nThey were kind enough to give me a free dish and I'm sure the hair wasn't purposely placed on my dish. In all honesty, I probably won't be back.",1
"If it were not for the pickles I would give it one star. n nOn that note, the pickles are mostly very good, although the kimchi makes one think that the chef has never had kimchi before, as there was no spice to it. Every dish we ordered noticeably lacked boldness where it was called for kimchi had no spice in it the escabeche substituted cauliflower in place of the traditional jalapenos bahn mi also lacked the traditional jalapenos and was made with an incredibly mundane ham, with a meager sprinkling of pickled vegetables. Spicy food makes me tear up but I'm not as scared of it as the chef. n nBoth of our entrees had fries on the side, one order was overdone and the other underdone. Both orders of fries became soggy and lost their crispness five minutes out. Perhaps I am just spoiled by the divinity of Opa's fries.",1
"Everyone has the reason they signed up for Yelp and Nacho Daddy is the reason for me anyways I'm more of a Trip Advisor reviewer. n nOK, here's the point. NACHO DADDY HAS CHANGED and not for the better. I would come here with 2 other friends and a child and not be able to finish the nachos and a pitcher of margaritas, however upon ordering the Tostada nachos it was gone in about 3 minutes. Gone are the days of high piled nachos. It's now as they should advertise it.as an appetizer. We asked server about the portion sizing and she stated, ""They changed the plate, but not the portions. "" There were abundant topping with almost no chips. n nPlease don't get me wrong. This isn't about flavor, tastes, or any combination thereof, but how the portions have shrunk. n nI'm not going into service in this review so I don't sound like a hater. n nSorry Nacho Daddy!",1
"Just finished my first trip to the downtown deli. Service was quick and polite even during the busy downtown lunch rush. I was a bit put off by the prices as this place was rated at one dollar sign. Ten bucks for a sandwich is definately not worthy of that distinction. Add in fries and a drink and my lunch total came to almost 14 bucks. Not ridiculous, just a bit more than i was expecting and a bit more than it was worth. nI had the skyscraper, a pastrami and corned beef mountain with ""melted "" swiss cheese. I say this because my sandwich was barely luke warm to the point that the cheese not only didn't melt it was cold. The fries were kept in a steam table tin at the counter and tasted it. They were edible but barely so. The quality of the meat was actually pretty good and the only thing saving them from one star. nOverpriced and underwhelmed.",1
"I have lived in their property for 4 months with a shattered window upon move in. They have yet to fix it, make up excuses, and are the least professional property management company I have ever dealt with. I wish I could find the owner of this lovely condo and let him her know how poorly it is being managed. n nProperty Owners and tenants beware. I also want to note that they claimed to have done a background check and credit score on both myself and my roommate. When I incquired about my credit score at the signing, the person representing Rossetti turned over a piece of paper, and rattled off a fake credit score number. I thought it seemed MUCH lower than mine, so when I got home I immediately checked my score, and I was right. She made up a number, and probably never even ran the real numbers.",1
"This place was okay but not what I expected. Family I were craving Mongolian grill this place was the closest on the west side. For the self serve Their poultry was thawed it gave a mixture of raw meat odor, it just smelled weird. By looking at it looks fresh it is. I think any raw meat like steak, chicken, pork, ect. shouldn't be side by side. Someone can easily scoop a mixture from one raw meat to another using the same utensil which is not good. Also the comparison to a large bowl to a regular bowl the portion is the same I asked the server what's the difference, does the large get more noodle or rice versus regular size? The server's reply was yes, I told her mine's didn't look that way all she said was that why it's always best to just get a size smaller. To me that's not consistent with the portion on what's large regular size.",1
"Good concept but poorly executed. Since I am a girl, I know that this review might sound negatively biased. I have been here twice and sincerely tried to like it. n nHere are my main complaints n Drinks are too sweet! I ordered a rose green tea and it tasted like sugar water. n The snacks don't really impress.small portions and bland. n Interior design is lacking. Maybe add some more tv screens, change the lighting, add some wall art, or table games? n Today, my order came out wrong and a friend of mine received her potstickers still cold. n nCustomer service is fine and the girls are pretty cute if you are in to hs girls. nOverall it's a cool place to show my guy friends however, I would personally prefer to have tea and snacks somewhere else. Go here if you just want to see young girls in lingerie and are not concerned with ambiance or the taste of your food.",1
"I don't see what all the hype is about. we came here for my dad's bday. we were not impressed. i think we liked a couple of their appetizers like the mushroom fries and also the mushroom soup but that's pretty much it. we were not impressed with their tri tip or the filet mignon. we've definitely had better! they weren't that tasty and the bone marrow wasn't impressive either. actually, the bone marrow had mostly onions. like where's the marrow? the chips that came with our steaks were super salty and hard and flavorless besides the salt that i had to rinse with beer. the beer was good of course it wasn't made there . also got asparagus and mashed potatoes for sides but they did not taste special at all. lastly, i told our waitress that it was my dad's bday and she didn't even greet him or bring out a cake or ice cream or whatever.",1
"WHAT?! I cant believe this place has 4 stars! the people reviewing this place have obviously never had good chinese food! we came here for their breakfast brunch and it was pretty awful. they had regular eggs and cantonese eggs, which was eggs mixed with what was supposed to be chinese sausage and some other stuff not good. they also had egg fu young, which was also yuck! they also had bacon and sausage and french toast.how is that chinese? the only two things that were just ok were the egg rolls and the dumplings, but note that they aren't good.they're just ok. i gave it 2 stars instead of one bacause the service was good and i didn't find a bug or anything in my food. i don't think this place is worth the 14, even though that's pretty cheap for a buffet in vegas. i know what a good chinese breakfast is and this sure ISN'T it!",1
"This was my first time coming to The Strand. It was a Saturday night. Dead. Service was ok although the waitress couldn't tell me the dessert menu offhand out of only four items . Most were store bought, not freshly made. I had the seafood linguine. Not good at all. The pasta clearly tasted old and my first bite of clam contained a gritty hunk of sand. The sauce was disappointing. Not flavorful. It was spicy and that's about it. For 18 I expected much better quality. The kicker came at the end when I was asked about the meal. I told the woman it was just ok and listed all the reasons why. She said she would send the manager. He came over and didn't want to hear what was wrong with the dinner which was really surprising. I heard the staff will be completely changed, but I won't be coming back. The Strand is strung out!",1
"I'd give it a 2.5 if possible. I'd recommend stopping by the wine bar and having a glass, perhaps some apps. However dinner, not so much. I was actually here about 9 years prior the food was spectacular and worth every penny. I just went again 11 1 08 , and I must say the chef has gotten lazy. The menu was far from seasonal, I'd question the quality of the food and overall just not worth it given the other superior dining options in Las Vegas. The chef Palmer needs to climb out of the rut he's in and get their menu back on track. As mentioned above, the wine list and the d u00e9cor, exceptional. Stop by for a few glasses and see the wine tower, however move on somewhere else for dinner we also ate at Social House in TI this past visit food quality was out of this world just one of many places to eat.",1
"Was expecting way better for some reason. I'd never been, but heard the name several times, so we stopped in for dinner tonight. n nCleanliness didn't seem to be of high importance in the little I saw of the restaurant. Smelled a little like cleaners inside the door, so that was off putting. My glass was sticky and the table was stained, it just felt like a low end chain experience. n nFood was okay pollo fundido was marginal. I've had better before, but it's hard to mess up. It was lacking quite a bit of flavor, though. One person in my party found aluminum foil in her food, to which the server responded that it was a ""hard, dry basil leaf. "" Right. n nProbably won't come back here again unless I'm on this corner and want Mexican food. Pretty unspectacular I can get dinner that's more flavorful at a hole in the wall place for half the price.",1
"Try the Kahuna Grande! D Went to this place again for the second time. I found out they have 2 Pacifico's all the time thats an awesome deal. If you're part of the service industry crowd you get 30 off your bill, that's pretty cool too. The service is friendly. This time I went late night on a Wed, I found food was served till Midnight and the place closed at 1am. I think thats a pretty good deal considering the place is in Boca park where most restaurants are closed. They have plenty of seating outside too! n nI think the seafood is absolutely delicious, they have their own recipe of green sauce, and I think my only complaint is that the tortillas are pretty crappy falling apart, soggy etc . They should definitely invest in a better vender for tortillas b Oh and the enchiladas were so tasty! I had a green cheese shrimp enchilada. AMAZING.",2
"Every time my bf and I are in vegas we visit Del Frisco's. It's good and quick. This time was a little different. The service was still great but the food didn't impress me. The crab cakes were very delicious but our shrimps were served cold. We thought they were hot shrimps, but they only serve cold shrimps. We had a couple of bites and left them untouched. For my main course I ordered the Australian lobster tail. It was a pretty good size but I think it was overcooked. The meat was too rubbery. Thank god for the crab cakes. I would have been unsatisfied. I had a bite of my boyfriends 38oz fred flinstone wagyu beef steak. I wasn't to happy with it. He seemed to like it. I guess I have lost my desire for red meat. They brought out a slice of bday cake for my boyfriends birthday. It was delicious and thick. Oh! If you ever eat here ask to see the cool James Bond table. Pretty coool.",2
"This salon has a great feel when you walk in. I love its brick walls and the chalk board door used to state the menu and prices. The people working in the salon are all warm, kind and hip. There is a tattoo studio in a back room, a nail gal with amazing hair and 7 chairs for hair. nMy stylist was Kelly Kay who is amazing! She brought my dyed black hair back to light blonde. Her cuts are always amazing and my hair is fine and not easy to cut. She's precise and has an quite the artistic eye! She has also cut my teen's hair and my 10 year old. She makes my daughter with thick wavy hair look amazing! nIf you're looking for color she is the best! I've had problems in the past with other stylist and breakage. Kelly Kay is so careful to not overlap and damage the hair. nA must check out if you are looking for a new stylist! KELLY KAY!",2
"I've to Flemings a handful of times now and have nothing but good things to say about it. I love the decor and ambiance. There booths are so comfortable and regardless of where you sit, I feel like it's still private enough. I've had dinner in the bar, in a booth, at their big center table and on their patio and every time has been great. Their staff is knowledgeable and courteous as well as attentive. Their martinis are a little expensive but so so good. I always go straight for their ahi tuna appetizer and the calamari. These two things are so amazing, and consistent. I love their french onion soup and their parmesan mashed potatoes. I've had most of the menu and can say that everything they put out is really good and worth trying. My favorite dessert is their creme brulee and fresh whipped cream.unbelievable. Obviously spendy but what good steak joint isn't?",2
"Yum, yum, yum! I wasn't even sure this place was open when I drove by it the first 1000 times but we finally decided to go in and give it a shot while getting the oil changed down the street. Well worth it! I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich and it was a MOUND of chicken with thier special jaco sauce on a bun with lettuce and tomato. Definitely plenty.I couldn't eat it all. The jaco sauce.which I was told contained soy, pineapple juice, honey, and worchestire sauce.tasted more like watered down soy all by itself. It was so salty! For my side, I had cheese grits and they were creamy, delicious, and a little spicy thanks to what I think were some green chiles. All in all, good stuff, but next time, I will get the sauce on the side. Oh! For vegetarians, this is a dream.they have at least 10 veggies on their side menu, plus specials of the day. Veggie plates all around!",2
"I had the privilege of dining at this beautiful restaurant last weekend in Vegas. The space was very chic and upscale. I indulged in one of the best lychee martinis I have ever had in my life and I've had quite a few ! n nThe menu was extensive, but exactly what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. My absolute favorite was the peking duck. Be prepared for a lot of food since it comes with 2 courses, first the duck in pancakes then the duck in lettuce wraps. Both were flavorful and filling. n nThe service was excellent and you definitely felt like you were having a fine dining experience even though you were eating the same type of food you would get delivered on a rainy Sunday evening! n nI'm not sure if I would return, simply because Vegas is filled with incredible restaurants I am dying to try.but I would certainly recommend it if you're in the mood for some great Chinese food.",2
"This place has it all! Great service, creatively delicious flavors, amazing mix ins, and free samples. nThe flavors are strange which is always a plus for me . I tried the dark chocolate raspberry habenero which was sweet and fruity with a spicy kick at the finish. It was delicious! I also thought about trying the fluffernutter but opted instead to get the maple brown sugar bacon. nThe girl behind the counter suggested I mix in butterfingers and so I went with her suggestion. Honestly I could have jumped over the counter and kissed her it was so good! It was the perfect mix of sweet and salty! This ice cream was honestly one of the most amazing flavors I have ever tasted! nThis is definitely a place I would try again! I would love to try a new flavor, but I am scared to venture away from that amazing dish! If you are ever out on Mill looking for an amazing treat THIS is your place!",2
"Rita's offers some great menu choices. Menudo is not one of them. nBut seeing how most people detest the thought of eating cooked bovine stomach, I can't see how this qualifies as any sort of problem. nOh, they don't serve Coke products either. n nBeing a south Phoenix native and a menudo aficionado, I'm uniquely qualified to discern good menudo from bad menudo. This is definitely a bad recipe. nThe broth has too much of a tomato base and tastes weird. nThe tripe is overcooked and flubbery. nOverall, it's pretty disgusting. n nSo if you're having a weird day, with a penchant for menudo and a caffeine free diet Coke, forget it. nInstead, have an ice cold Pepsi and a green chili burrito. nTry their chips and salsa too. n nFour stars for the server's gigantic hangers. nOverall, Rita's is a good restaurant but their menudo does suck balls.",2
"Juliette is a wonderful place to bring in a group of people and have a nice conversation while enjoying decent desserts. The ambience is very modern and cute like, and they do have free wifi. The food actually took a bit long for it to be served. n nI ordered chocolate fondant with milk chocolate and vanilla ice cream. The ice cream was very rich and creamy, and the fondant was also really chocolate y and great, but it was a bit too sweet for me. Maybe I should've gotten dark chocolate instead of milk. n nI also ordered the dulce de leche crepe with pear. It was a huge portion, and the crepe was amazing. However, after each bite, it was getting to the point where I did not enjoy it as much. n nI'll definitely come back here for other desserts with a few peeps! Hopefully there are better desserts than the ones I've had!",2
My dad is a native of Chi town so he knows his pizzas. I've lived in Illinois for a few years as well so I'm acquainted with the Windy City's style which kind of made me a bit picky about pizzas . n nThe place has a pretty spacious eating area decorated with Chicago sports memorabilia. They also offer free hot dogs if you have their name of the day. Too bad my middle name didn't count for today's name of the day. n nTheir dogs are great and there's lots of combinations available if you're in the mood for a slice of pizza or Italian beef. They even offer Green River at this place too. n nWe took a deep dish pizza with us home and I was stuffed after one slice. Since my mom doesn't eat meat my dad and I are gonna have a hard time finishing this thing by ourselves! n nOnly advice I might add is that they only have 1 or 2 ladies who are nice taking orders so be patient the food is worth it. ,2
"I finally made it for dinner and I love this place. n nOur ""table "" were 2 comfy couches with a small table in between. It was so perfect. Live music quietly played so we could still maintain a normal conversation. I love the low key atmosphere and little quirks this place has. It definitely makes a perfect date night. n nFor the sushi we ordered First Love Roll, Bobcats Roll, and a Screaming ""O "" Roll. First Love was a more basic roll with mango that did not overpower the roll. Had a big of a wasabi kick to it. n nMy favorite was the Bobcats Roll. It was a more complex roll with a lot of elements to it. The crab salad topping made this roll. n nI only had one piece of the Screaming ""O "" roll and, although it was not as spicy as I expected it to be, it was still a yummy roll. n nI will definitely be back here since I loved every second of it.",2
"Food is excellent, but I would strongly suggest you make a reservation. On our first attempt we were turned away at 830pm without a reservation. We were in the area and it was early so we stopped in on Sat. evening as we passed by at 630pm. Several open tables but all were marked reserved. They reluctantly took us and 2 other tables that arrived shortly after us. We waited about 10 15min. to be served. It was only annoying because those other 2 tables had their orders taken before we had drink order taken. Once we ordered food was out promptly, under 15 min. n nWe loved the complimentary cracker bread with sauces to start. Dhaba Chicken Korma Tandori Tikke chicken were fantastic and worth the wait. Portions aren't huge but we still had leftovers. n nWe'll be making a reservation and returning soon!",2
"Had my anniversary dinner here last night! The ambience was really romantic even with all the convention goers passing through the whole evening! There was live music playing in the ""court yard "" in front of the restaurant. The food was delicious! I had the Chicken Canolini and it was perfectly made. Chicken was very tender. Bf had the slow cooked veal in red wine and risotto recommended by our watier was amazing. The meat just falls off the bone! Soo good! As soon as we were seated, the waiter learned that we are locals and it was our first time. as we got ready to pay, the manager brought out a complementary tiramisu nd said complementary because you guys are locals and its your first time ! It was soo yummy nd sooo nice of the them. Service was bomb, food was bomb, the outside seating ambience was amazinnggg. Awesome anniversary dinner. Highly recommended!",2

"I was introduced to Fukuburger through a magazine article. After reading the article which specifically mentioned the Tamago burger, I knew I had to head down to Streats to find this unique burger. n nI'd have to say, I haven't eaten anything like it in my life. It was truly a distinctly asian tasting burger. I was shocked, surprised, and mesmerized, all at the same time. It was also messy but what do you expect from a burger with a drippy egg stacked inside of it? n nThe service was super fun. I love how they had you come up with a nickname for your order that was a nice touch. And the girl taking the orders was super cute that certainly helps business, I bet! n nWhile it's not something I'll be craving, it definitely was a unique and incredible burger. If you're looking for something that's totally crazy and out there, Fukuburger is it.",2
"Uber Decadent food! This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, which says a lot, as there's no shortage of great places to try, but none of this quality. n nI really like the duck which is prepared southwest style as no one else does. There's even a chorizo cheese tamale to accompany this wonderful entree. However, the last time I deviated and went with the New Mexico Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with a Bourbon Ancho Chile Sauce and a Sweet Potato Tamale Crushed Pecan Butter. OMG decadent doesn't even describe what Bobby has done. n nThe restaurant has a nice, quiet setting and is pretty well buried in Caesar's. Give yourself some extra time to reach this location from the front door of Caesar's. n nService is wonderful and though they are extremely busy, you never feel pushed. The wine list is excellent and the passion for excellence shows in every minute detail.",2
"Things to know before I gush about how much I love Camelback n n Be careful with rolling manual cars even with e brake! use a rock! n Not all dogs are cut out for Camelback n You have to use your hands for parts n It gets really crowded early in the summer n Possible to run parts but there is no way I can do it all n If you look close in the summer, sometimes you can find a rattlesnake! n Say hi to Sunny, the 70 year old guy who hikes it 4 times a day! n nThese are the things I have learned the hard way.over time I have found that although cute little dogs can bound the mountain my rhodesian ridgeback just don't have hops. Today, I was at the top with my friend when we were alerted our mini coop was on the run! Luckily some nice person saved the car and two spots became three and eventually we squeezed out. Lots of fun!",2
"You know, Mr. Smalls DOES have a lot of bad points. The bathrooms really are disgusting. Gross toilets hidden behind even grosser curtains. maybe there's toilet paper, maybe there isn't. Just use the curtain, whatev. It's also pretty hard to shimmy your way up to the bar once you manage to get there, yeah, the drinks ARE expensive. Oh, and yes, the parking is atrocious. I usually have to park a few blocks away, but it's cool, I've got these legs for a reason. n nAll that being said, Mr. Smalls is my absolute favorite venue for shows. They bring in really good bands and the sound is pretty good. The building is unique, and there's something just so bizarre about seeing all these bands playing in a church. And when it comes right down to it, it IS a rock and roll show. were you expecting polished marble floors and caviar? Just suck it up and dance the night away!",2
"Nowhere can top this facility. I really consider this my home away from home. Every instructor is absolutely qualified to the highest level. Martin, Liz, Marc, Janelle, Monica, Nikka.I mean everyone is fantastic. Each person makes you feel so welcome. They really, really care about your time spent with them. My sister has been doing yoga for 10 years and has been active her whole life. I took her to Martin's TruHot Pilates class one weekend and she was hooked. She lives in Colorado and she told me she actually experienced a bit of fitness depression because she could not find a class that matched Martin's class. Every teacher is fantastic. Just when I think I have plateaued or tried every class, more diverse classes are added to the schedule. TRX Pilates has left me sore in places I haven't been sore in for a long time. JUST FANTASTIC. LOVE THIS PLACE.",2
"Mmmm mmmm good! I love me some Mongolian food! Went with a friend on a Sunday around 5 00 and there really wasn't a wait at all which was great since we were hungry! The host was very friendly as was our server who greeted us right away to take our drink orders. As soon as that was done we made our way to the fresh ingredient area. I was pleasantly surprised to see what I would consider an above average selection of various meats and vegetables available. Marinated steak anyone? Pineapple? I think I will! I also loved that you can pick from different options to go along with your food steamed rice, fried rice, noodles, tortillas, and a couple others I can't remember . I chose the fried rice and I'm proud to admit that I ate the whole bowl, it was delicious! Next time I'm up this way I'll definitely be making a pit stop here!",2
"This is good stuff! I went to the location on Tropicana and ordered the garlic romano fries and a pastrami dog. Both were very good. The pastrami was juicy and tender and the fries had a good flavor on their own. No ketchup needed. n nThe owner, Brian or Bryan, was very friendly and seemed to love his job. When he took orders out, he would look at the food with admiration. Almost like he wanted to eat it himself! The guy next to me ordered a Gyro fry, which I didn't see on the menu. It looked really good. Brian Bryan said that there were some new additions that were not on the menu. n nI should note that this is a small place with only four tables inside. They have the owner, who takes orders and gives the food out, and a cook behind the stove. So, if it gets a busy, you may have to wait a few minutes for your food, but it is definitely worth the wait.",2
"This review is for the take out window at the original Red Devil restaurant. I grew up in this neighborhood and have come here since I was a wee lass. I remember begging my mom to get out of the car so I could stand in front of the pick up window and ""help "" her carry the pizza to the car. n nI still come here because the pizza is amazing, they always have a large cheese wings combo on special, they make their own super chunkily creamy delicious bleu cheese dressing and the guys who work at the pick up window are super sweet even when it's blazing hot outside, and inside, near the ovens . Sure, you have to remember a random number they give you at a moment where you'll never be able to find a pen or something to write with in order to pick up your order like Carolina's , but it's still my favorite pizza complete with a chewy, delicious crust. Enjoy.",2
"Finished shopping and started to get hungry after a small breakfast at Lux. We stopped in for a quick lunch and for seated right away. After we arrived within 5 minutes there were about 6 groups that showed up and they had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. n nI had the special of the week, burger with pastrami and coleslaw on rye. It was a big burger and filled me up. I liked it and prefer my burgers on bread slices instead of buns. n nWife had the Zinburger, which was a regular cheese burger. I tried both and liked the special of the week better. n nWe split an order of truffle fries. These were good as well. They came with a dipping sauce that was tasty. nNext time we will split a burger a lot of people were splitting burgers and try a milk shake. Someone next to us had a bloody Mary with a slice of bacon in it and that looked good too.",2
"I love me some Jones market. As there is a dearth of Russian Eastern Central European restaurants in Las Vegas, Jones is a life saver. I miss my Polish food and Jones gets me through by stocking such favorites as Profi pasztet Polish country style pate , Delicje chocolate covered biscuit cookies filled with fruit , and Prince Polo chocolate wafer bars . n nThe selection for Polish food is better at the Polish market duh but Jones is closer to my house and is gigantic. I think Jones is targeted more toward Russian Balkan products but, that's fine by me, I love to buy it all. Also, my boyfriend regularly cleans Jones out of their Serbian pickles, stuff he buys by the carload they are the best ever . If you're scared to try the typical groceries, you cannot go wrong with Milka and Kinder chocolate and their tons, TONS of delicious European beer. Nuff said.",2
"I have only been to Durant's a couple of times for drinks and dessert, but it was just such a cool place that now I have to go back for dinner. n nThe beginning Even though I know it's commonplace, I still felt weird entering through the kitchen. n nThe atmosphere If the cast of Mad Men were on location in Phoenix, they'd totally be at Durant's inhaling scotch. n nThe lowdown Our server was professional and helpful suggesting wines for us as well as dessert options. We went with the strawberry shortcake and received a gynormous plate heaped with enough delectable amazing ness to feed six people easily! The moist, spongy shortcake was topped with fresh berries, lots of whipped cream and then sprinkled with chocolate flakes. DEEEElicious! n nThe verdict Two thumbs up! nTo do list Eat dinner here.",2
"I had a group of 19 people go to Vegas to celebrate my birthday. I can not believe how well they accommodated our group. We called on Wednesday for reservations on Saturday. Originally they said nothing open but called us back in a couple hours saying ""Something had opened up "". nWe arrived early for our reservation but hung out in the bar until our table was ready. It was the perfect fun environment to have fun and celebrate something. Like everyone else says the nachos are AMAZING! I had the chicken and broccoli pasta. It was nothing special but good. I loved my balloon hat with my age and proudly wore it gambling the rest of the night. It probably helped that as the birthday girl I demanded everyone else wear theirs too! haha! Overall I had a great time and out of 19 people no one had a single problem with food or service!",2
"It's a donut shop. They have other stuff, too. But basically it's a donut shop. Brand new location. I do my best not to eat donuts because they are soooo not good for me. But if I'm going to have a donut, Bosa is the one. n nI've not tried the boba drinks nor their ""sandwiches "". My wife likes them. I can't help but think of the scene from ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World "" where they have a burger with a donut bun. But, no, they don't use donuts as buns here, so fret not! All I can say is they do have my wife's seal of approval. n nAnyway.donuts, coffee and tea, boba drinks, and breakfast and lunch sandwiches. This is what they do. Their donuts are probably the best in town, or at least the best I've found so far. You pay a bit more than grocery store donuts, but it's not that much more and these are MUCH better.",2
WOW! This is a beautiful Spring Training stadium! I was able to attend the Season Opener of the D backs and Rockies and loved this place. It did take what seemed forever to get a parking and I am sure that they have worked out the kinks. The lawn seating covers the entire outfield and is the best place to watch a game. The food was fantastic! There were so many choices. I decided to go with some fry bread and I was not disappointed. My next visit I will have to try out Salty's or Native New Yorker. I did get to spy on a celebrity.Gonzo was signing some autographs for some lucky fans! I loved the selections of micro brews that are available at the stadium. I like that this stadium has sunblock stands available courtesy of CHC. I can't wait to watch several more games at this stadium during spring training!,2
"I just went there for a visit, and it was half an hour till last call which is midnight there on a business day , so my review can't really comment on the food or the drinks. BUT the atmosphere was really cool. To get to the bar, you have to walk through the whole shop and ""gym "". It's certainly interesting, different than any bar I know. It's kind of an open area, so cold at night but they've got heaters yes, inside . Considering the sketchy neighborhood, I would never imagine something so cool there. Tons of vintage drinks served in big drink glasses and an awesome food menu. I'm excited to come here when it's open for a bit longer to indulge! I would recommend longer hours though, especially around the holidays. It's definitely someplace different to go to, and in Downtown Phoenix, there's not many of these places. Take a break from Lost Leaf and check this place out.",2
"Living downtown, Pop Up Pizza has become our go to pizza place preferable to the much closer Radio City Pizza, but hey, Pop Up delivers, so it's all the same . n nThey are vegetarian and vegan friendly with vegan soft serve and pizza. Their plain cheese is basic but tasty and they have a number of specialty pizzas, as well. I like the Goodman, which is topped with potatoes! n nThe garlic knots are amazing do not skip them! While ordering delivery we were told we had to get a minimum of 10, which is a lot, but we ended up reheating them with leftover slices over the next few days and they were great even as leftovers! I recommend freezing and then reheating for 10 minutes at 400 F. n nAnyway, it's nice to have a decent pizza place to order from nearby don't be fooled by its weird location in the Plaza, this is good pizza!",2
"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. I take out of town family and friends here, and everyone always has a good time. I like that they make the guac fresh at the table. The drinks are awesome. They have good happy hour deals on food. Sitting at the bar area is actually pleasant. Great patio for a nice day, fun to wear sunglasses, people watch, and watch the cars drive by and all the South Charlotte runners. Ambiance is not cheesy at all, hostesses and servers are friendly, etc. There is a weird fishbowl room for large groups that I would avoid if you come in a large group. But definitely make a reservation, you will need it this place gets packed! If you come on a Sunday after church the crowd is full of Uptown Dilworth ""society "" families schmoozing. But that does not detract at all from how great Cantina is!",2
"On a whim, I purchased an Amazon Local deal for a Petit Facial from April. n nI don't consider myself a super girly girl, but I figured a facial isn't anything crazy.just trying to look a little less dry? I mean, come on, this desert! n nFirst, her space is very calm and relaxing. April is genuinely friendly and super nice. When I had my first appointment with her, she was very informative letting me know what she was using, what was in it, why she was doing it, and so on . She put it to me straight in telling me that for my age, my skin could look better. She listened to my concerns I have super sensitive skin and I felt comfortable with the products she used. n nAfter three visits, I can already see a huge difference in my skin! More hydrated and less congested skin? Yes please! I HIGHLY recommend taking a little time for yourself and making an appointment asap!",2
"Pretty good pool party. Some words to the wise n you can bring sunscreen in n don't be an idiot and try to sneak drugs in you will get caught n lockers are 10 bucks! WOAH, wet republic charges you your bank account n sunscreen will cost you 38 bucks if you didn't bring your own n NO GUYS ON THE STRIPPER POLES lol this one was entertaining. Security WILL take you out pretty quickly. n Sizes for drinks are cups or pitchers. Pitchers are 107. As always they charge by the volume, not by the drink. Smile at the bartender they understand what's up. Got a 107 tip not included pitcher of Long Island Ice Tea for the group she asked if we wanted extra alcohol duh . n Make the most of it, don't get out of hand, or they'll throw you out. n n I actually liked wet republic more, but encore is pretty solid. I'll need to try marquee out on our next trip.",2
"Once again, a great meal at Hula's! We got there at Happy Hour time, so it was a little chaotic, but we were seating in about 5 minutes. nThe staff there is always super friendly and we were lucky that Dana came and said hi. He's an owner who ""gets it "" when it comes to responding to customers, as he did after my first review. nThe Jamaican Jerk Chicken Plate was uh mazing! When it arrived and I saw the portion of chicken, I almost asked if they had made a mistake. It was a HUGE pile of jerk chicken! The dish also came with Johnny Cakes. Corn cakes with spices and fruit? Yes, please! Fried plantains are also one of my favorites and theirs were perfect! The right amount of crispy on the edges and sweet and and and foodgasm! n nThis place is always busy when I drive by. Know what that says? Just another great spot to eat in CenPho! n nThanks, Dana!",2
"First thing's first, the waxers are very nice and provide very relaxing atmosphere. I have been there twice first time to get eyebrows and underarms, then second time to get another underarm. n nAmy, who did my eyebrows, just cleaned it up. Just the way I like it. So Kudos to her. n nHowever, my underarms were not waxed very well. The first time, I can understand because I shaved it before. Some hair just couldn't be waxed completely. It's really understandable and I think Amy did a great job removing as much hair as possible. The second time. Not so great. My hair started growing again in 3 days! Really? I don't remember who my waxer was but when I got it the first time, my hair grew slower than the second time. n nSo overall, I had a positive experience, except that hair grows a bit too fast. I am definitely returning again to try other services.",2
"I have been putting this review off, so time to do it. I am a little behind. But, this is a place that I would go back to any time, and a place I really liked. nIt is close in the area to us. It is a clean place that smells really good when you walk in. The smell of Italian food cooking fresh is always good. nI got the Italian Wedding soup on my last visit. Along with Garlic knots and the Steak Salad. Wow, what a filling meal. nIt was really good! I am not usally that into the soup when I go out to dinner, but this is worth it. Very good. nThe salad had a lot of dark lettuce in it. Which is something that we all like. nThe wine is reasonably priced. Service was great, and the owner even comes to greet you. nI like it ,it is a nice place ,and decorated very nice as well. nIt is good for groups if you call in advance and lots of parking as it is in a shopping center.",2
"Sorry to hear 5 people called out, take charge if people don't want to work get rid of them. I imagine it is not easy to get good people in, but keep trying you have a good thing going. The service needs a lot of work they have had to turn away 4 groups of patrons since we have been waiting 30 mins already for food. Waited 40 mins for food and it was not hot barley warm. Haven't seen the waitress more than twice. Jake did come to apologize for the long wait and was very kind. Food is good even if we had to wait a while for it. n nLayout of restaurant is not good for flow restaurant management. They need some help from Robert Irvine. I hope she can make it since Maricopa needs some good quality food place's, any place that can ofer fresh GF gets a plus in my book. Good luck to them I hope Helen can continue to make her dream come true.",2
"Miller's Graphics struck me as being very specialised, stocking high quality painting supplies for the budding graphics designer. n nGavin hit the nail on the head it's all very professional looking. With sets of hundreds of pencils in wooden cases, durable canvasses and easels, everything is of the highest quality. They have an ample supply of chalk, charcoal, graphite pencils for sketching and a selection of mediums for you to create your latest artistic masterpiece. n nThey stock everything your art desires get it? , from fine pointed pens for calligraphy to spray paint for street art. But even though it's geared towards professional artists, they also sell some art books and lovely gift ideas. Their wrapping paper was absolutely gorgeous and I'm considering buying a ton and decorating a wall in the house with it. It's too beautiful to be town in two after a present has been opened!",2
"Waaaaaa? n 3.5? no way! nI don't even know where to begin. My mouth is getting watery while I write my review LOL. We weren't sure where to have dinner so we didn't make any reservations. Waited about 15min for a table but it was all good because we waited at the bar. Their specialty are mojitos. They must have every tequila in the world. nOk time to talk about the dinner.I had the mole with grilled chicken. The sauce was good, obviously it was made from scratch. The guacamole was made from scratch. The salsa's for the chips was good, the tortilla soup was good. The dessert OMG awesome! Everyone else was satisfied with their meals too. Service was excellent and place is very nice with a nice romantic setting. What else do you want? n I really recommend this place, a bit pricy but well worth it!",2
"I don't necessarily review movie theaters, especially not a chain of theaters, but AMC Ahwatukee needed to be reviewed for some strange reason. I've notice that on two or three different occasions, the theaters have been eerily empty on Friday nights for opening blockbuster movies! It's really peculiar, considering the teeming and buzzing outside the theater doors from pre teens and teens at the hookah lounge or at the sushi bar. n nI give this theater 4 stars based on that merit alone. This is a biased review, as I really enjoyed watching ""Terminator Salvation "" with my friends last night with a less than packed crowd of people. It was opening night! So, either Ahwatukee is flushing out for the hot summer, or the theater is struggling with ticket sales revenue. No sure which, but for my moviegoing experience, it couldn't have been better.",2
"Only been there once but would definitely want to go back again. All day dim sum! The food was good but it being dim sum, sometimes it freshly made and some if it was probably a few hours old and cold by the time it got to us. Went there early afternoon on a Saturday I think and it was fairly empty and they didn't have as many runners and food going around so it took a while for us to get a decent amount of food on our table. I don't know when their prime hours are but it's probably better if you go sometime around there where they're expecting to have a lot of people, thus more food being prepared and it being more fresh. I'd definitely go there again. n nHad two tvs but what they were airing was completely random. The big screen had a soccer game going on and there's another screen up front by the waiting area and that was airing Entertainment Tonight or something.",2
"Highly recommend! n Professional, courteous, experienced with a very high quality deliverable and friendly staff. nI have been using Zizzo for about a year now. Based on the reviews I took a couple shirts in to have fitted and it was instantly apparent this was a professional place with many long standing customers. I found everyone chatting and laughing in a friendly atmosphere and the employees busy assisting customers. I also found the professionalism, advice and fitting to be of superior quality. I have since taken my suites, shirts, pants in for fitting and have received nothing less than top quality. nIf you are looking for a quality and professional tailor with good prices and a little bit of neighborhood barbershop friendliness and feel at home the minute you walk in, then, Zizzo is an excellent choice.",2
"OK.aside from bowling and movies, there's absolutely no reason to go to the Southpoint anymore. This place is awesome and I can't wait until it gets warmer to fully enjoy all cool outdoor spots they have here. n nWe had a drink at the Ravello Lounge where a Bacardi diet and appletini came out to 9.75 total! What? Awesome. All the staff we interacted with were super friendly but we'll see how that goes in 6 months P n nThere are 2 places with enomatic wine systems.Veloce and Hostile Grape. Both were great and I am definitely taking my wine snob friends to the Hostile Grape. n nCan't wait to go back. I'll put some hours in at the poker room and maybe some pounds on at one of the restaurants. n nI guess my only gripe about the place is the parking area. There just didn't seem to be enough of it during peak hours. Quite a few cars just driving round and round.",2
"When I saw that the Hooters Casino in Vegas had an average rating of 2.5 stars, I almost had a chicken fried heart attack. Look, if you don't love Hooters restaurants, then you probably won't like the casino either. But if you're already a Hooters regular, this place is fantastic. First, you can eat buffalo wings while your dealer shuffles. The blackjack tables are cheap. Plus you're surrounded by girls in low cut orange running shorts. So 5 stars is a no brainer if you're a smoking, boozing, buffalo wing eating. low stakes gambler. I can't speak to the quality of the rooms. I've only eaten and gambled in the joint. I'm sure the rooms are nicer at the Mirage, but whatever. Bottom line Hooters breads and fries their wings and each one packs about 200 calories of greasy chicken. And the girls are hot. 'Nuff said. Five stars. Easy.",2
"Since PA has such wonky beer and liquor laws it's always essential to be located by one of these fine establishments. I mean, I guess it's not essential.but it's a nice perk! n nThe guys here are very nice and helpful when it comes to picking out a great beer. Did you know there's a 95 case of Pumpkin Beer?! Must be one heck of a beer! No, I did not get that but I wish I did! . n nYou're also able to get a keg reservation fee 30, but you get it back when you return the keg and all the instruments that go with it tap, tub, etc. . They'll even special order you local Pittsburgh brands like Church and Penn Brewery. n nI'm a beer drinker, but I wouldn't say I'm a bulk beer buyer, so all the info these guys gave me was helpful. Most people may know this, but you can only buy cases of beer here, no six packs. n nHappy beer swilling!",2
"Love the Vig Uptown's vibe, decor and oh yeah, food! The only thing that I tried that I thought was just ok, was the Pad Tia. The sandwiches are wonderful, would prefer large cut fries more, but I still enjoy the shoestring type. A friend of ours, a die hard foodie, Loved the pork chop with the polenta and cherry sauce. if we had looked away for a second I'm sure she would have licked the plate! nAll in all, the only bad experience we had was the forced valet service. Just drives me crazy that a restaurant uses the main parking lot for ""free "" valet, when it should be for customers, and valet down to another lot. No such thing as free. then people sneak into lots down the way to save the tip. If this was Chicago, or New York I could see it, but not Phoenix. But don't let that keep you away.",2
I hate it when you go to a sandwich shop let's say for example subway and they skimp when constructing your sub. Once upon a time a friend of mine worked at subway and I did not know it was physically possible to put that much meat in a sandwich until he manned the counter. Ahhh good times and Capriotti's keeps the good times rolling. n nShared the 12' Capastrami and seeing as I was extremely reluctant to order a sandwich with a large amount of cole slaw I can say that I was thoroughly converted by the Cap. The meat was plentiful and the combination of the pastrami and cole slaw was superb. n nAs I suggested they really load the sandwich and give you a bang for your buck. n nBiggest drawback is it's no where near the strip out in no man's land. My friends and I dropped by upon leaving a none of your business weekend in Vegas.,2
"On my first visit here upon the recommendation of a friend of their excellent hot dogs, I went and had a very good Chicago style hot dog. Having commonly gone to Chicago for experiments, I have had quite a few Chicago style hot dogs from Chicago, and these are up to par with those that I have had in Chicago. n nI had not known about their excellent ice cream waffle sandwiches on this first visit. When I went a second time and had this delicious treat, this place really stood out from other locations around the university. n nI'm a fan of vanilla ice cream and they definitely have the staple ice cream flavors such as this to go with your waffle sandwich. But, for those who like to try interesting combinations of flavors will love how the owner makes a special ice cream of the week to go with this dessert. n nOverall, a very good place. Enjoy!",2
"I'm glad I'm the 2nd reviewer of this place. After a headache getting into town and finding out our original hotel reservation was cancelled at Monte Carlo long long story , we headed over to Excalibur the next day for the duration of our stay for CES 2012. Hungry and tired, headed over to ABX.and the hamburgers were delicious. They had so many choices of sauces.I'd say close to 12 16 types ranging from creamy, spicy, herb infused, and just many more.it was hard to choose just one. It's a half a lb of meat.which I think is a lot.and all the toppings you'd like. You customize your order and they'll make it for you on the spot. They have turkey burger options as well. The place is clean, trendy, and very Americana.if I was craving a hamburger without the Vegas price tag, this is the place to go! Thank you for being there at our most hungriest time and after a long day of work and headache.",2
"First thing I noticed when I walked in, a friendly staff. Then the aroma of a busy Italian kitchen. The food we ordered was very good and portion was generous. The Capresi hero was made with fresh in house bake bread and their homemade Mazzarella. The eggplant parmigiano with pasta was delicious. Their garlic knots are delicious and addictive. Vinny was our waiter that afternoon and his service was excellent. Another waiter walk by and asked us if we needed anything else. That's a nice touch when the dinning room staff help each other out. We will definitely will go back again and again. Love the selection in their bakery, too. We had the Boston Cream Cake for dessert. It was delicious and the sweetness was just right. I checked ""Casual "" for the Ambience section but I would prefer to describe the restaurant as comfortable.",2
