"Went to see Dr Caldron to rule out RA, the experience was the worst I've encountered in my medical history. I came in with numbness, tingling in my hands with excrutiating pain in shoulders and arms. First they must watch too much medical shows on TV as they use the assistant as your puppeteer, who informs the doctor of your symptoms and then the doctor addresses her not you . He was condescending, unsympathetic to my issues and literally told me its just arthritis.deal with it and sent me home. But not before ordering blood tests that were already completed by my primary and the results given to him prior to my appt. I should followup in a few months, really? NOT, of course the bill arrived.hundreds of dollars not well spent. Just a factory dwelling on the elderly on medicare.",1
"My 4 year old attended the week long All Sport Camp. On Friday they take the kids to the park across the street and they left him there. THEY LEFT A 4 YEAR OLD KID, IN THE PARK, BY HIMSELF! Fortunately for us, a park employee found him and called the City Marshall's and he was returned safely. I supspected Meir sp? was lying to us about the whole incident, I am sure he was trying to cover his own ass. My suspicions were confirmed when I got a copy of the report from the Marshal's office. The Marshal said he would have pressed charges if he could but could not prove intent. Needless to say, any parent who loves their kid should avoid this place. You literally may not get your kid back if they do to your kid what they did to ours.",1
"We went for their happy hour on a Friday after work, which is only offered in the bar area. The bar area was packed and we grabbed the last 2 seats. Our friend joined us a few minutes later, but he had to stand for about 5 10 minutes until someone left and we cold source a chair. The prices didn't really seem discounted at all, and the service suffered because of obvious understaffing. Food quality was poor. My calamari was bland and overcooked. Bf ordered the prime rib slider, which was shaved prime rib that looked like an Arby's sandwich, but didn't taste as good. My friend got the steak kabob, which was actually pretty good. Atmosphere was busy, but not very lively. My advice, drive down the street to Charleston, and go to Fleming's for happy hour.",1
This is a Terrible ride I have even have. My friend and I we were in a group of 11. And the worker there have set us in a group with other group together. But at the end my friend daughter went in first then the worker stop my friend they say is to the limit already tell him to take the next one my friend daughter is only 5 year old. They fxxking left a 5 year old kid alone with bunch of stranger and won't stop and let the ride still go. This is the most terrible experience I even have. And it hear from other passenger told me there have been a lot of malfunction to the ride. The door close itself without wait for all passenger in etc . Did any one have the information where it can file a compliant to the head Office please advise.,1
"Bad service 3 times gets you yelped. n nStrike 3 Recently we changed our address and they are holding a pile of mail. Since we are out of state now, my tenant goes over there to retrieve the mail they are holding 3 weeks now and they replied ""I'm not going in there now to sort through it, it will be mailed to them next week "" OH I see, it takes a month for you to do it? Should have taken 5 days. n nStrike 2 They changed our mailbox key and gave us the wrong key. Nobody would help us until my husband had to pull the attitude card. Jeesh! n nStrike 1 I received a gift in the mail, box was too big for the mailbox, so they kept it at the post office, no note, no drop off, nuthin'. I had to go track it down, there it was sitting there waiting. for someone. to deliver it. A week they had it.",1
"The size of the servings is almost immoral. There is a 3 charge for sharing, which if you come to think about it, would not make it a bad deal if you both happen to want to partake of the same disgusting sandwich. The quality of the food and its size are in inverse proportion our meat was dry, tasteless, visually revolting, anchored by two slivers of bread to justify calling it a sandwich and not a chunk of dead dry beef. The worst sin was the chicken soup, that traditional icon of soothing relief yellow liquid with a taste of having recently sprinkled or dissolved from an envelop or a cube, sodium being the preponderate flavor. nCan't believe the place is so popular, but in Las Vegas everything is possible, I guess.",1
"We stopped by for a quick dinner hoping to find that this well located fairly new place. It is a sports bar through and through. This is not a place for great or even adequate food. The waitress told us that they made things fresh and that they have a great chef. Our experience was that everything we ate appeared and tasted frozen and fresh heated. nThe firecracker shrimp was tiny little shrimp heavily breaded, frozen and deep fried. There was no taste of shrimp there, only spice batter. The 1 2 rack ribs were small riblets, individually cut, and also apparently prepackaged. The iceberg lettuce wedge had mediocre blue cheese dressing and artificial bacon. nThis place may be a great bar, but it is not a restaurant.",1
"I had a lunch date with a friend and she suggested we eat here. It seemed very busy and I was willing to wait to be sat. However, It took about 5 min for anyone to acknowledge me. Servers made eye contact, yet no one made the initiative to approach me or even say ""we will be right with you "". Oh well, made my way to the bar to get some kind of help. Eventually was sat somewhere in the restaurant. Took another 5 min for a server to come over and greet me. Maybe some FOH issues with management or lack of staffing? Either way, the food was decent and service was mediocre. I wouldn't go back for the fact that the customer service needs improvement. However, I am the type of person to try a place twice in no hurry to make that second visit.",1
"Had a simple salad. Butter lettuce, walnuts literally that's it with salmon. Something like 12 for it and it literally looked and tasted like they just threw the items on the plate. No tossing or arranging or anything. At least the lettuce was washed. The salmon tasted frozen and had huge peppercorns crusted onto the top. I was hungry so I ate it but was not happy at all this was their idea of a 12 salad. My boyfriend had the adriattico boa? I think that's what it was and said the tomato cream tasted like the vodka sauce from Safeway. Cafe Boa used to be good, now not so much. I think it's lost it's luster and they have a lot of nerve charging the prices they do for mediocre food. Probably won't eat there again.",1
"Just left this place with my wife. We went there based on these excellent reviews and we were very dissapointed. In contrast to the overwhelmingly positive reviews, we found it to be very high prices for very mediocre food. n nI had the lamb and my wife had the chicken and shrimp, both were edible but bordered on terrible to just plain bland my wife had to put salt and pepper on the chicken just to give it some incling of recognizable seasoning . n nIve had much better lamb in gyros in our home town of Janesville that run around 5 bucks. so this lamb priced as a 35 dollar plate being far worse was quite a shock. Avoid this place, and instead spend your money on one of the many great restaurants that surround it.",1
"If it wasn't for the customer service is probably give this place just a star. the seating reminded me to oacked sardines. I was disappointed dish after dish, there was nothing to rave about except maybe one of the salads with sashimi? I think it was the poki? I can't really remember the name.of.it. I thought that since people rated this place so highly it must be good, boy was I wrong. Sorry to say even though the customer service was superb, I wouldn't recommend this place because the food was just lacking in quality and freshness. And I know that its hard to expect that from a all.you can eat sushi place, thats hella far from the ocean. but there are joints like oyshi and goyemon that never seem to let me down.",1
"We previously had a wonderful dim sum brunch, but our dinner this evening proved to be disappointing. Service this evening was beyond slow so I called over the manager and explained we had a show to catch and could she call over a waitress. She literally called across the room and a waitress soon appeared. We gave our orders, Singapore noodles and wrinkled green beans, while advising of her of our evening's plans. Our green beans arrived, but some 10 minutes later we were still waiting for the noodles. I again called over the manager who called over the waitress who checked with the chef and said it would be a few more minutes. Both dishes were decent, but it would have been nice to enjoy them together",1
"Me and the hubby went in while Walmart was changing the battery on our car. So not a place we sought out but more out of convenience. n nWe both ordered a hamburger I had a cheeseburger and he ordered a Southwest burger. Mine was ok over cooked, cheap bun but ok. Fries were about average but I liked them. My husband didn't like his Southwest burger at all. Said the flavor of the BBQ was too sweet and he said the patties were pre made pet peeve for both of us but edible. n nWe sat at the bar because there was only one person working the whole restaurant. He shook our hands and asked our names.? I guess they want to be the Cheers of Greenfield and Baseline. n nFine but nothing to drive out of your way for.",1
"So hot in this place I wanted to do an ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. Polite note that says ""the A C is not working "", the note really meant to say ""owner saving costs by turning A C off "". n nWe did not realize that our group showed up without enough time to finish. Upon finishing the 14th hole in a round where we were playing fairly quickly to get out of the heat the Manager stops us and says they're closing and we need to wrap up. Clearly the manager knew we would not be able to finish when she gladly took 40 from us before we started. n nOh, and I love the '19th hole' plinko style contraption they rigged at the end to collect your ball. I'm no engineer, but after looking at it I'd say no one is gonna win the 'prize'. n nFool me once Lunar Golf!",1
"My husband and I went here for dinner and it was a ghost town. We were the only people in the place and I soon found out why. The service was amazingly slow considering we were the only ones there. We ordered our burgers, you can build your own, and waited. They take the blue part of their name a little too seriously which I could handle except for the obnoxious blue tint on the windows.ugh. when our food arrived my order was incorrect, I was stunned by this seeing how they had one order and could not get that right. Whether it was the fault of the server of the kitchen who knows? I did not mention it I did not feel like waiting for it to be fixed. So in short, bad food, bad service, unappealing atmosphere, and to top it all off an expensive price for a tasteless burger.",1
"Not much to say here. I do have one suggestion. Nothing makes for a crappy, overpriced cocktail like a 6 Jack and Diet served in a piss warm glass fresh out the dishwasher. How about a cool glasses for your customers. Also be attentive while tending bar. I might want to be served another piping hot cocktail. Shouldn't have to use a road flare to get your attention. n nThe place is clean and fancy. Most of the clientele are stuffy business people, probably from Am Fam. Don't expect a humorous night out here. Forget about single women. Typical Madison sausage party. n nPositives Open Mic once in awhile. Clean, usually friendly staff but slow and inattentive n nOk place to visit if there isn't any other choice.",1
"I am surprised at all the good service reviews for VT. I have given this place a few tries and have not once had good service. Usually when I experience ""bad "" service, I look for ways for the bartender waiter to redeem themselves during the process. Unfortunately, I have never had that here. I checked the reviews here because this place is one of the few that I have dined at in Arizona that, for lack of a better phrase, left a bad taste in my mouth. As far as the food, I was never too impressed with that either, but the reviews say otherwise from my fellow Yelpers. n nI will say that my last experience was so bad it prompted me to write the corporate office and they were responsive and sent me a 25 gift card. Maybe I will give them a 3rd chance based on everyone's feedback.",1
"Service dept. needs to up their game and get either more motivated or more on the ball. n nSpoke with John in the service dept. about a routine safety recall. Told him there's also a problem with my cruise control. Was told there'd be a 2 hour wait which I had not been informed of prior, but anyways. Hour and a half later, i'm told the truck's done, everything looks good, take care bye bye. Without any further information other than my receipt. They never looked at what I asked them to look at, and didn't attempt to tell me why my abs light and service maintenance lights were on which I know why, but you think while performing a multi point inspection, they'd check and help . Terrible service and I will find another dealership.",1
"The worst buffet ever, don't do it! I usually read Yelp reviews prior however a friend decided to treat me and it was their last minute decision. n nJust say no! If you re staying at Luxor I recommend you eat somewhere else because the selection and quality of food is HORRIBLE! n nI sampled quite a few items and everything was bad. A lot of the food was cold, not cooked well and tasteless. n nThere is no selection and it must be the world's smallest and most sorry excuse for a buffet! n nThe name says it all, MORE BUFFET because you will be left feeling that there must be MORE than this buffet has to offer! n nThe best thing to eat at this buffet was their ranch dressing. n nThe best part of my night was when I grabbed 3 sugar cookies and stuck them in my tits and walked out.",1
"I agree with Barney B. this place is totally ghetto and a very out dated , especially in comparison with the chicness of places like the Wynn and Venetian. the stratosphere doesn't compare. My boyfriend and I stayed there for two nights and the room was something out of a politician sex scandal . a clean but ugly typical room. It was cheap though which was great for someone on a budget , which sucks in Vegas , where money talks loud. Our room was facing the parking garage and it was quite loud with car alarms going off all morning and night . So I won't be returning to the Stratosphere ever agian . unless I hit rock bottom and have to turn tricks yes I spotted quite a few hookers there . put that's a whole nother yelp review.",1
"I used to love Roberto's aka Maria's because I could walk there and they had decent, consistent Mexican food at a good price. However, the last couple times I've been there, the food has not been decent at all. My husband got a carne asada burrito and pulled out a chunk of fat probably one inch by one inch by one inch. No exaggeration, there was zero meat on this chunk. Sick. After that, we decided to give Roberto Maria one more try since we had had so many good times in the past. Once again, the meat was gristly and neither of us finished our meals. Instead, I'll be going across the street to 100 Natural for my takeout Mexican food from now on. It's a little more expensive, but at least I can actually eat it!",1
"Unfortunately this is the worst BJ's location I've ever been to, and I love BJ's food normally. The deep dish pizza was just not that good, and I normally think their deep dish pizza is a model of perfection. The crust wasn't really 'deep' and more like regular pizza crust. The toppings were pitiful barely any sauce, practically no cheese, and very little of the toppings that were supposed to come with the pizza. I was so disappointed. The service is great but that doesn't really matter to me when the food they are bringing me is sub par. They have all day happy hour when games are on and the bar has a decent number of TV's with NFL Sunday Ticket but the food was too disapointing for me to go back.",1
"I give this place two stars, but I do it with love. I was a semi regular when I lived on Peel. Always a lineup outside, because they card at the door bring ID! and it's usually packed to the brim. Amazingly cheap for most things. The 99 cent shooters on Thursday night are only slightly alcoholic but most are delicious. Never bothered with the food, although I hear it's in the okay fine nothing to write home about realm of quality. A decent place to knock back a pitcher or six with the homies. Impossible to hear yourself over the din. Some people say the bartenders are rude I've never had one I minded. Surprising number of tourists. Don't bring anyone here that you want to get with, for the love of God you will automatically fail.",1
"We came here Easter Sunday. They had leg of lamb and a couple other additional items including lobster. The price was more than the normal 33.99, instead it was 49.99. Although the variety is better than must Vegas buffets, with the exceptional of Wynn, the price is certainly not worth it. The wait was long, although not longer than other buffets. The lobster was definitely frozen and the imitation crab stuffing was awful. The raw oysters didn't have any flavor and the leg of lamb was dry. I do have to admit the prime rib was good as was the lobster bisque. However it still wasn't worth the 49.99 price. I've had better, for instance, Wynn and Bellagio. Save the money and stick to those two, the drive from the strip, the wait and the price just isnt worth it.",1
"What are the chances of getting my money back? I wanted to try your restaurant out for the first time. I had the 2 fish, 6 shrimp platter with rice. And the lobster bites. The lobster bites, fish, and shrimp were bland and greasy. My fingers were literary greasy after picking up the food. The rice had zero flavor. The hush puppies were the most disgusting thing I've ever put in my mouth. Whatever fake butter that is used is horrible. It tasted like they were soaked in butter and then fried. The tarter sauce is sweet and the cocktail sauce has no kick to it. About 10 min after I had a few bites of each thing I literally vomited from all the grease and fake butter. I'm not sure why anyone would actually continue to eat this food. I would love to get my hard earned money back!",1
"Cheba Hut is a place I love and hate. I love the quality of the sandwiches and the fact they're toasted! They have veggie options and all kinds of sides and unique drinks, and a variety of tasty desserts. I hate how it can be hard to order your food cause the cashier or sandwich maker is high and slow as shit. The weed theme is amusing, but it can only go so far before it affects the quality of the service and the work ethic that a business has. Numerous times I have had rude, stoned jerkoffs answer the phone and treat me like I'm a fellow piece of shit stoner with all the time in the world, which is bullshit. I know other people have had the same problem and the management needs to address this tell your employees to leave the herbage for their own time, and to bring their A game to work!",1
"Scumbag move of the day goes to Jimmy John's store 2311 9985 S. Eastern Ave 100 . Ivica and I left the office to grab a couple sandwiches, where, there was a homeless teenage kid with a tiny dog standing outside under the overhang since it's raining heavily today . Kid wasn't even asking for money granted there was a sign on his suitcase that said ""anything will help "" . Well before I could buy the poor kid a sandwich, they had called Henderson PD on him, which, if anyone knows these cops, they'd probably arrest him and he'd never see his dog again. Fortunately, I don't think they found him. Bottom line you're a collection of low life scumbags and I'll be damned if you ever get any of my or my companies business ever again.",1
"I was very excited for the opening of Echo Rig since I tend to dine at the same restaurants in Summerlin. Overall the food was hit or miss, but the service definitely was sub par. I understand they are new, but there are certain things that are not forgiveable. We were at the bar for drinks while waiting for our table. We first ordered up at the bar, but then found a table to sit at. After we finished our drinks, multiple bartenders and bar servers walked by without any acknowledgement. We would've easily ordered another round or two of drinks. I suppose I could've flagged someone down, but being in the hospitality industry I think the staff should be paying attention to their tables and empty glasses so the guest doesn't have to go out of their way to receive service.",1
"Three hungry girls sick of eating the same old crap, we decided to check this place out since we were nearby. All three of us lived in turkey at one point in our lives so we have all had good Turkish food. Anyway, we got the yogurt drink which was delicious. Two of us got the beef doner plate and one got the chicken doner plate. I think we got the left over scraps because we went late so chicken was dry and the beef was greasy. The salad had a spicy dressing which didnt mesh well. The hummus had little flavor. We expected better pita, but they used the usual arabic pita. I hate that pita. i was hungry but I could finish my plate, it just wasn't good. n nThe older gentleman who served us I think he was the owner was very polite and personable. I just wish I could have liked his restaurant.",1
"This was my first time ordering from this location. I ordered the Jetty punch with energizer. It was awful! I was on my way to an appointment so I couldn't come back, but I called to let them know that the bananas they were using were bad. At least, that's what it tasted like. The girl proceeds to tell me the ""Energizer "" is BITTER in flavor. I think it's curious that they would make a BITTER boost to go into a sweet smoothie. If that is true, I would think you would tell your patrons that it's going to change the flavor. n nI am surprised they didn't offer to re make it for me, since I was clearly not happy. I will not be visiting this establishment anymore and will tell everyone know to steer clear!",1
"Mediocre at best food for an extraordinary price! Let's compare nFoosia Chicken Bowl vs. Typical Teriyaki Bowl Place nPrice 8.50 vs. 5.00 nMade to order No vs. Yes nLarge Portion No vs. 1.00 nWhite Meat No vs. .50 nBrown Rice Yes vs. Yes nAll veggie Yes vs. Yes nDifferent Sauces Yes vs. Yes n nI ordered a chicken bowl with brown rice. They had no all white meat option for the chicken, which irked me. Every decent fast food asian bowl place I've been to has this option and they charge less per meal. They gave me a decent amount of chicken but only because I raised my eyebrows and glared at the guy when he gave me one scoop of chicken before trying to pile on the veggies. But the chicken is fatty and very oily. I will not be returning.",1
"WORST HOTEL EVER. n nIf I could, I would give it infinitely negative stars! First off, I waited in line for over 2.5 hours to REGISTER for a room ONLY to be told that I have been relocated ""around the corner "". They wouldn't pay for a cab ride and that resulted in us having to walk to the place. Okay, we got relocated to the Mariott SuiteHill Inn's which was SUPER nice but that is besides the point. n nThe point is is that I wasted a WHOLE night in vegas just because I had to wait to register for a hotel room. SO DUMB. n nIf I could, I would give this place infinitely negative stars. This place has forever earned a place in my mind as the worst hotel in the world AND I will pass this on to all my friends. n nDisgusting.",1
"Holy Salty Soup! I literally JUST went there over my lunch break and I can't even eat the chicken noodle soup because its so salty.it almost burns. I am HIGHLY disappointed that a deli cannot do yummy chicken noodle soup properly. Its like I poured 2 salt packets into my mouth. I got the 1 2 sandwich and soup combo and for 7.75 you would think the sandwich the Symphony would be a lot bigger than what I got. It's basically the size of a half of a ham and cheese I make at home. Although the sandwich was kinda tasty, for a half, it's still TINY and not worth it for 7.75 and a cup of a salt. I don't think I'll go back. I am disappointed. There just isn't a good sandwich shop around here, I guess. Boo.",1
"I lived in Utah for a long time and loved the Provo location I ate there once a week from 2001 2011 and I was so happy when they opened one here, but the staff is so bad I have to psych myself up before I go in. They ask what you want on your salad AS THEY ARE PUTTING IT ON. They don't wait for an answer. nI regularly get my beans on the side and I'd say 9 10 times they've had to remake my order because they didn't listen. And once they stuck my side of beans in a styrofoam container in my salad to pass down the line . I'm certain that styrofoam wasn't washed. nI've complained and asked for someone to call me several times and they never have. If I wasn't nostalgic and loving the pork I'd never go here again.",1
"THE STENCH OF COW AND HORSE MANURE AT 110 DEGREES! Last weekend we had a family gathering in Vegas and stayed at the South Point because we had good experiences there before. This time they also had rodeo competition going on and they keep the animals next to their arena AND keep the doors open leading to the hotel. Consequently, the smell of cow and horse shit in the hotel's Coronado Cafe took your breath away and it spread out through the gamming area. Outdoors you could smell the manure at the pool and when you went out to your car in the parking garage that smell at 110 degrees almost stopped you in your tracks. If you are planning to stay at the South Point make sure no animal events are going on.",1
"This place was a favorite of mind , but why should you call in your order live a mile away, get there in ten minutes for them to say, what order? did you order something ? then receive bread that is not quite soft or a bobbie with not so cooked stuffing or pastrami that is underdone on a hot sandwich. The girl working the register very unprofessional, she thought it was funny that she could not find the order and stated so. Her eyes looked glazed , maybe she only receive a little sleep the night before maybe she was on drugs. I will report her, I do not appreciate her non chalant tone and attitude. Please get it together, before others catch on and get the quality customer sales associates that your business require. I live in Vegas now and I would not recommend this location to others",1
"Over the last year or so, I've noticed a big change in the culture of the Pet Hotel. Things have changed for the worse. n nWe've been taking the dogs here for years. The dogs always seem to enjoy the daycamp. When we board them however, things always seem to end on a bad note. This time one of the dogs got sick and had to go to the vet. I approved the quote they gave me over the phone, but when I came to pick them up, the amount was 30 higher. When I asked for an explanation and a discount, the staff on duty was no help. According to them, there was no manager on duty at the time, so I was stuck with the amount owed. n nI am really unhappy with Pet Smart and the Pet Hotel. The chances of my dogs returning is very low.",1
"OMG, how did this place rate 4 stars. Went last night and the food was bland and terrible. Both of us threw out half our dinner, inedible. The breaded chicken for the sesame chicken, C13, and Gen Tso's Chicken, C12, had so much fat and skin mixed with what was presumably chicken meat of some sort definitely not white meat that it was actually worse then a chicken mcnugget. Just a gummy blob with a bland sauce with a hint of ""hot "" for the Tso. The pork fried rice was also quite bland with an off taste. The egg roll was decent though. The little fried wonton pieces tasted like they were cooked in oil that was WAY past it's prime and were also stale tasting. The broccoli perched on top of the entre tasted old and tough. This was at 7 pm on a Saturday.",1
"Lifeless extra crispy wings and what must have been yesterdays leftover thighs and drumsticks in original, served at 10 30am. Its obvious KFC is Yum brand's red headed stepchild these days. . Seriously I've seen high school dissection projects with more appeal than those tortured nephilim inspired drumsticks, does the FDA actually approve this stuff for sale to people? n nThe colonel must be turning over faster than his bastardized legacy products, if you don't want an overprocessed pressed chicken patty between two lifeless bread buns you're in the wrong place, cause the chicken with bones in it isn't what KFC cares about these days.

"Sometimes all you need is one impression to ruin it all. n nFirstly, if you have a voucher from Restaurant.com, they won't take it on a weekend. I genuinely do not know why.

We were afraid it wouldn't be enough food, but the servings we decent sized, and we STILL couldn't finish them. No reason to eat more than to have something in your belly, because the food isn't good enough to finish. Reminds me of the pre packaged stuff you get warmed up at event venues, or amusement parks.

No thanks. Went in with family. I got the veggie. It was caked with mayo like it was put on with a caulking gun . When I went back up to ask for a plastic knife to cut up a portion of my sandwich to share with my 1 year old I was ignored while the staff person talked on the phone in plain sight of me standing there like an idiot for like 3 minutes waiting to be acknowledged. When I finally was I was told they didn't have any such knives . . .hmmmm . . . for a place that advertises catering out the ying yang per the propaganda posted all over I find this hard to believe. To add insult to injury it's overpriced. Go to Jersey Mikes instead. Cost about the same but taste better and service is better.,1

Not only did it take 15 minutes for someone to even give me a menu, the waitress was upset she had to work or something! The place was half full and not very active, so I have no idea what was up with the wait or attitude. n nEverything on the menu seemed a tad overpriced for an off the Strip lunch sports bar. Everyone on staff looked depressed or angry, like a Siberian gulag crew. After giving another five minutes for someone to come by, even when waving someone down, I finally gave up and left hungry. n nPlaces like these are ten to a mile along Sunset, I wish I'd picked a better one to waste half my lunch hour in.",1
"I checked out this restaurant with a few girl friends while shopping in Charlotte. The traffic was horrible, we were starving, so we figured we would try it. n nThis restaurant reminds me a lot of a want a be Disney restaurant. They tried very hard with the decor, but most of it came off a little tacky and childish. The cleanliness of the restaurant seemed to be lacking a little bit, and the food was not very good. I tried their clam chowder, which started out good, but the more I at the weirder it tasted. One of my friends ordered a salad, and the fish was not cooked correctly. n nIf you are looking for a nice seafood restaurant this is not the place. If you are looking for a quirky environment with fried fish this could be your place?!?",1
"I've eaten here 3 times now and the consistency has been lacking. The first time I got the Brisket meal with fries on the side. It was alright but didn't have much of a smokey flavour. The second time I got the large Brisket sandwich which was fantastic and extremely filling. The third time I got a pound of the Brisket and the quality was quite bad. Huge chunks of fat made up at least 1 5 of the pound. It was drenched in fatty juices but not in a good way. It was falling apart, again not in a good way. It seemed like it had been sitting for a while. Their fries are fantastic though so I'll give them that. n nIn a pinch I go here if I need my BBQ fix since it's nearby but this isn't authentic BBQ at all.",1
"What a terrible experience at this one! I have never seen a worse ran store of any type. If you are a regular you get to skip non regular's in line because they walk in the door get their order's made skip you in line and you don't even get asked what you want until that regular has their food and has paid! We were in line before three of these regulars walked in and they had everything and paid before we were spoken to. I called the area manager Rosita and didn't even get a call back, too bad that this area of Einstein's has failed miserably! I was a huge fan of Einstein's in other cities but will never visit another one again. I know these are very strong words, but they are very well deserved!",1
"We have lived in the area since '07 and have never eaten here. We finally went for breakfast and here is what we discovered. Food ok at best. The sausage tasted like it was reheated in a deep fryer. The hashbrowns were mushy and barely warm. The chix fried steak was not crispy due to being smothered in gravy. Both our meals seemed just barely warm. Service again ok at best. Trying to get that second cup of coffee is a real bear. The third cup is even harder. 20 for two, you be the judge. I really get the feeling that if your not a regular your not wanted. They have their steady locals and thats what they feel comfortable with. Overall, probably wont be back for breakfast. Just to answer one last question, when we got there they werent that busy.",1
"Dined here about a month ago. Sushi decent but entire evening ruined by a server who thought he was part of our family, trying to join in our private conversations, pushing signature rolls more than once, forgetting chopsticks AND plates, neglecting to clear. Even saw him sitting DOWN with another table. nWe had a coupon to apply, which server made note of , then returned later with manager to tell us it had been used previously. We used another lesser one, but checked website next day only to find they were BOTH validated the night before. TOTAL dishonesty. n nSo obviously not a repeat here AND after calling next day to talk to manager, complained, with nothing of any value offered. Oh, so sorry n nEnough said",1
"What Great customer service! n nOk this is what happened. My flight to sf was delayed so I was leisurely walking to my gate. I went to the gate where there was a San Francisco flight boarding but it actually was not mine. This was the previous sf flight delayed until now. I found out when I tried to check in, they said I was checking in for the wrong flight. Ok, fine. n nI went to my actual gate and found out that my flight was delayed for the next three hours! I don't think so, so I took off back to the other gate and asked nicely if they had room. And the agents went to the computer, clicked a couple of buttons and presto chango, I was on! n nThanks Virgin America! n nPlease also know the plane is cool, updated, all seats have the mini TVS and the crew are funny.",2
"Nice and clean place, perfect for date night. The waitresses are always friendly, but service can be a little slow when it gets busy. That probably has a lot to do with the fact that I've never seen more than one waitress at a time. nThey have a beautiful full bar and a good selection of cocktails and beers. No sushi, which is a shame since the sushi bar looks really nice. nI come for the Soon Tofu stew, which is always really good, but very mild. Ask them to make it extra spicy to get a more flavorful stew. nThe banchan is pretty good too. I haven't tried the barbeque, but I've seen others ordering it, and they look like huge portions. nIn short, good Korean food, probably your only option in the Summerlin area. Try if you're on this side of town!",2
"Just for some background info, the buffet at the Wynn is by far my favorite one in Vegas, and I actually had not been impressed with any other one I had visited yuck no Bellagio buffet for me . With that said, I decided to check out the Wicked Spoon due to the positive reviews and my desire to stop going to the same places to eat every time I am in Vegas. n nI was very pleased with the experience. The service was a little meh, but that's to be expected from a buffet. The food was not outstanding, but it was definitely good for a buffet. The presentation was great, and I didn't feel like the joint was overly crowded, even on a Sunday. I don't know if I'd go again, but I'd say it's definitely worth checking out.",2
"I've been to some of the 'best of the best steakhouses' in Vegas and Craftsteak is always by far my absolute favorite. The service is always top notch, but the food exceeds all expectations. I've brought my family, friends, boyfriend for many occasions and everyone always loves Craft. n nThe Lobster Bisque is packed with lobster meat and it's not super heavy. I LOVE THEIR WAGYU TARTAR! Other great options are their quail, seared scallops, roasted chicken, rib eye and lamb chops. Everything here is great but those are my top picks. If you're lucky enough to go during the summer season, you MUST TRY the sweet corn. It's one of their staples and I know why! n nIt may be pricier but it's worth it. I miss my hometown and Craftsteak is one of the reasons why.",2
"We had a party of 33, so I called ahead of time. The person I spoke to on the phone didn't seemed too thrilled about a large party coming in. I was a little worried about that because we have been to restaurants where service was horrible because of large parties. nHowever when we got there, everyone was really friendly. Our waiter we got on our end of the table provided excellent customer service. The lady I had spoke to on the phone stated that everyone on the same bill must sit together. Our waiter allowed for our kids to move around and said he will work with whatever we decide to do. He went above and beyond! The food was excellent as well! We enjoyed this location the best we've been to three locations in California ",2
"Myself and two buddies went to Vegas last weekend. We decided to got to Marquee on the Sunday to watch Kaskade! What an amazing time we had. We had a sun bed between the pool and cabanas which worked out perfect! Brooke was our first waitress who was super friendly and cool. Then she transitioned with Stephanie. Stephanie made us feel very welcome and showed amazing customer service throughout to rest of the day. Our busser was Pat. He also show us amazing customer service, helped us with anything we needed, kept checking on us, but not in a pushy way just making sure we were cool. The security guard circling the pool was John. Super nice and super chill. I would highly recommend anyone visiting Vegas to hit this pool party.",2
"This is a really typical place where Laval people and West Islanders of Montreal will go after a night at the bar. The heavy drinker requires some remedy before going to bed feeling like crap. Paulo Suzanne is a snack bar opened 24 7. Really typical with the possibility to eat breakfast whenever the F you want! Now that's the spirit. Poutine, hot dogs, Philly steak sub, Hamburgers everything's got fat in it and that's what going to help you get over that intense drinking that. You need to fight Fire with Fire. n nThe place is near Pont Lachapelle well known by Lavalois , Hopital Sacr u00e9 Coeur, and the 68 busline which is one of the only bus that will bring you back in the WestIsland Roxboro, Pierrefond, DDO, Ile Bizzard . A MUST when you need that little extra before sleep snack.",2
"It's hard to imagine why so many people had bad experiences because mine was great. The shuttle was easy to take and they are constantly running so you never have to be standing there waiting for one. It's really very easy so don't worry about that part. I got to the Rental Car Center around 11 am on a Friday and there was no line. I booked on Avis.com an economy car and it turned out to be a cute, brand new VW Beetle! I felt very cool. The prices were really cheap 20 day with all the taxes and I had no problems with the car. Returning it on a Wednesday at 9 30 am was a breeze, too. Pulled right in, no waiting, no problem. Hopped right on a shuttle outside and was at my terminal in 10 mins. Employees were very nice, too. I would definitely use Avis again.",2
"In case you want to avoid walking for 10 minutes for food in the Strip, this is a great place to go. Luckily, my room was in Tower 2 so all I had to do was go down and it'd be right there off of the elevators. Their breakfast was delicious I had the ordinary eggs, bacon, and potatoes breakfast. The food was served beautifully, and it tasted even better. The best part was the bacon.cooked just right and had a very different taste from other bacon I've had before. It was just a little pricey, but then again, it's located in the Signature. n n The service was a little lacking though. It looked somewhat busy, but we had to wait a while to get our check, and even that took a little effort on our part. Besides that, the service was on par for this type of restaurant.",2
"Just about any bertos around town is going to be a good bet. It just happens that the Filibertos in my neighborhood semi recently changed to Juliobertos, but I haven't really noticed much change in the food. n nAnyway, Juliobertos is my go to for a good, hearty, cheap burrito on the go. Their tortillas are really good, and what's inside is even better. I usually go for a bean cheese rice guacamole burrito with tons of hot sauce which is awesome in every way possible, but if you're feeling like something so heavy you won't want to eat for the next 12 hours but it irresistably delicious I'd go for the Arizona burrito, which has Carne Asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese. Although, I remember that one being way better when it was Filiberto's.",2
"Came for breakfast. Have to say, the bloody Mary's are very flavorful! Citrus with a good amount of flavor spice, and not too thick filling served with jicama, olive, celery, lemon, and lime. Probably one of our favorite bloody Mary's. We had a 10am reservation, and we were seated around 10 15. The restaurant was quite busy. We placed our order around 10 30. Food came around 11. The meals were well prepared. The chilaquiles were my favorite! Very savory with chicken, vegetables, and an egg over easy on top. Torta bread was fluffy and delicious. Tortillas were great. All the produce was very fresh. Presentation for some of our meals burritos, chorizo breakfast was a little lacking, but that doesn't take away from the flavor. In the end, everyone in our 7 person party was happy!",2
"I've been to 7 Bikram's studios throughout the country. This studio is my favorite because of the people. The teachers are great and the students are very friendly. There are some incredibly inspiring yogis that go here on a regular basis.people overcoming huge physical and emotional challenges. Also, there are probably more people over 50 than I've seen at other studios. Don't try to make excuses for yourself because of your age! You might be standing next to someone in their 60's. There is one student that is 81 and she started last year! n nSandy is a great owner. The studio is always clean and it does not have that Eua du Bikram ""fragrance "" that other studios have. I'd highly recommend this studio to new and experienced students.",2
"I have been a long time customer to this cvs. Staff is always so nice and willing to help. I love the front store staff although r is changed quite a bit recently. So glad to see Richard, Ro, and Ray are still around. They are absolutely great and the original reason I made this my cvs. The pharmacy is great always very personal and I love seeing the same caring people. Ama and Amanie always greet me and my husband by name. The male pharmacist is fantastic he makes every trip there a truly great experience. My favorite cashier Mercedes has moved to pharmacy. She is so nice and very patient. I'm glad they've promoted her. The newest ember Austin is seriously an asset to CVS and I hope to see him in charge one day! It's nice to see such a wholesome caring staff in one place!",2
I went here twice. Once with my sister and thirty minutes after I left with my mom. It is not overrated this really is one of the best places in Old Downtown. I got the crab spinach dip to share and the bruscheta yum and we had billions of bellinins the BEST passionfruit and peach must try. They also had a kiwi tini with real kiwi inside and tasty as ever. I could not get enough although that was not even my drink I ordered the mango sunset was really strong and once i got my way to the bottom got really sweet and mangoeeey puree. A must try when you are in Old Downtown. Next time I will have to try their fillet or porterhouse as well. Nice layout and a high 5 slam dunk for me. Everytime I come I will go there! people from new york montreal even young ones go here. it is a melting pot. ,2
"The BF took me here for Valentine's Day.and he done good! This show was awesome! I've seen other Cirque shows and this is my second fave L.O.V.E. being the first We got there a little before 9 30 and had to pick up our tickets at the will call. Luckily, that didn't take too long. The ushers there are very nice and eager to help you find your seat. We were in section 202 row JJ. We had a good view of the stage and everything else going on. With any Cirque show I would recommend sitting a little further from the stage with everything that goes on. It's nice that each seat has built in speakers. I didn't quite understand the storyline but still loved the show. The music is really good and there is alot of action through out the entire show.",2
"I have eaten at this place more than a few times, and have yet to be disappointed. Main dish I get the number 10 , fries and a drink free refills for two and we get out under 25 bucks every time. n nAnd honestly, to those who say 9 or 10 bucks a head is too much to spend to eat out, I simply scratch my head, agree to disagree and point them to McDonald's. You'll get a lot less many places for a lot more. n nEvery item on the menu is in picture form and described on the big wall over the open to view cooking area, so you see what you get, figuratively and literally. Proximity to the movie theater at Tempe Marketplace and speed of service are what brought us in, great food and a nice counter girl keeps us coming back.",2
"We ended up going to the event and they were able to squeeze me in. I had to sit backwards which meant every time the instructor did anything I had to move, which was a huge PITA, but otherwise it was a great night. To be honest, I don't know if it was so fun because of the people in my group or the event itself, but I will say I enjoyed myself. I can't stand to paint and don't have an artistic bone in my body but my painting actually came out really nice. n nI will say that just about everyone there who had purchased a Groupon had issues with it, so I stand by my recommendation that you do NOT buy a Groupon if you want to try this out. I bet if you call the company they will give you the Groupon rate without you having to buy the actual Groupon.",2
"When I do get coffee or the urge for caffine, I'd probably pick Caribou over those other chains. I still haven't really found a homey mom and pop corner coffee shop, but I haven't exactly been looking that hard either. n nThis location is pretty convenient and the people are nice not a huge location so it seems like there are always people here. May be hard when you come and it's busy to get a table place to sit. n nI happened to wander in after having a hearty meal at Chipotle next door. Good way to cap the dinner off. unfortunately I was wired for the rest of the night. A on the effective caffeine content of your coffee. F for me for not being smart and drinking coffee after dinner on a Sunday night. Monday was quite a long day after a sleepless night. Fail on my part.",2
"I bought all new tires. Here are my tips to making your experience as good as possible n nFirst use the Discount Tire website to figure out which tires you need. Enter your car information and it gives options with prices and recommendations. n nSecond reserve the tires you want online and schedule an appointment online with your preferred store. n nThird decide whether or not you want the 'Repair Refund Replacement' option which they usually try to sell you on at the store. n nFinally finish your order online. n nI arrived on time for an 8AM appointment and was immediately greeted. They looked at my order, took my keys and my car went straight into the bay. 30 minutes later I was driving off their parking lot with all new tires.",2
"My Big Bang Theory. n nImagine if you will.A food court Food fight.somewhere among the chaos a Quesidila and rice bowl Collide!. n nThat's in my imagination how Chinos came to be. n nIn this great Hole in the wall place You can mix and match not just Flavors but entire cuisines. n nwant a Sweet and sour Burrito.sure.Jerk Chicken in your rice bowl. what ever you want. n nOh as a side note watch for them on Food Network on the Dinners and dives show. n nI love getting Emerald and Red Jade Quesidillas.makes me feel a little Healthier.then the Burritos. n nThe staff is really good at explaining things, Eddie was extremely helpful.and Cookies are a great treat. n nThey have more options then a Crayola box.don't get intimidated nGo in try the samples.feel free to eat out side the lines.",2
"Nice park where there are a multitude of things to do. Picnic, fishing, paddleboats, outdoor sports, running, or taking your dog for a walk, the park is large enough that you do any of these activities without feeling like it's crowded. When I was a kid we'd often go here for BBQs or picnics. If you call ahead you can reserve a ramada for any outdoor parties. n nSince getting a dog, this is my go to place if I want to take him out for a long walk. He loves the open space, ducks, and grassy hills. There are multiple dog bag stations for you to use and there's garbage cans evenly spaced throughout the park, but unfortunately there are still patrons that don't pick up after their dogs, so beware where you step!",2
"AquaKnox was amazing. nI ordered the surf and turf, and my filet was cooked perfectly, and served with a delicious reduction over a bed of mashed potatoes. The lobster was crab stuffed, and the drawn butter was seasoned with something that made butter taste even better, if that is possible. To start we had a cheese plate, that was by far the best cheese plate I have ever had. The server brought us mini carrot cake bites at the end, courtesy of the chef. nThe service was really attentive and yeah, it was pricey, but I will never understand why people go to an expensive restaurant then complain about the price. If you are docking stars for the price people, I'm pretty sure there is a Panda Express around the corner. nLoved loved AquaKnox, will definitely go back.",2
We had a great experience with this company! I woke up on a Sunday morning to a hot house and searched yelp for a c companies and called them because of their great reviews. I called them and the girl on the phone was very friendly and sent someone out and they were at my house in about an hour and a half.Robert came out and figured out we had a refrigerant leak. He fixed it temporarily but wasn't able to find the leak that day. Dustin came out a few days later and found the leak. He fixed it within about an hour. They are very honest and professional! They give you a 2 hour window and they are definitely there within that window! I will be using them in the future for sure! Highly recommend!,2
"We scheduled two moving helpers and a biggest truck they have with only 130 hour. By this way, we don't need to deal with renting and returning the Uhaul. Their schedule was full but they still be able to schedule us on saturday because it only took 2 hours max to finish our moving. We have just finished moving and these guys did a great job protecting our new walls, stair, as well as our furniture. There are not a lot of stuffs to move but the two guys were really fast and carefully. They showed up even before us and got to work immediately, they used their own blankets and cardboards to protect our furniture in the truck. The job finished half an hour early and we paid by credit card. nDefinitely will use this company again.",2
"Went there last September for my first Vegas trip. We hit Rain, Ghostbar, Ice etc. While Ice was cool, Studio 54 was my favorite due to the music. I'm a 38 year old heterosexual male who actually goes to clubs to dance, not so much with the drinks. The music was the best out of all the clubs we went to except for Ice, but they had The Crystal Method playing there that night. Studio 54 has cool dancing girls hanging from the ceiling and Go Go Girls closer to the floor in ""theme "" costumes. I like that you can go a level up and see all the action going on. As for covers and lines just do yourself a favour and get a ""Vegas Passport "" and breeze through any club you go to.well worth the 99 bucks for that!",2
"Dan tinted my windows about four months ago but I wanted to wait to see how the tint held up before posting a review. I couldn't be happier. The tint still looks like it came from the factory, even though the car sits outside, uncovered, 24 7. n nCommunication with Dan was great when setting up the appointment and he even called me the day of to let me know I could come earlier if I wanted. He finished the job in less time than he said it would take. His work was thorough and neat. n nDan works out of his house, but it's close enough to shopping and food so you can walk somewhere to kill time while you're waiting. n nI highly recommend Dan and will definitely use him the next time I need some tinting done.",2
"I have tried to explain this to people after seeing the performance. It was at least 8 months ago and I still have no way of verbalizing what I saw. ""Simply astonishing "" is what I fall back to but that doesn't do Cirque du Soleil 'O' any justice at all. n nI know tickets to this run 150 a piece and up, so I had no expectation of going. But we got hooked up with free tickets from my buddy's boss. And they were the best in the house. Lower half, center section, half way up, middle of the row. Breathtaking. I was beat from the day and all I wanted to do was take a nap before the show. But there was NO way I was skipping out on this. Next time hopefully free as well I will have my undivided attention on the stage.",2
"This was an awesome hotel! We had a view of the airport and of the strip. Beautiful balcony, sitting area, two bathrooms, and a kitchen. Everything was very updated and modern. Only complaints were that it was a walk to the strip, but the monorail was in the MGM which is connected, so that wasn't bad. Also the pools were ridiculously crowded at the MGM. The Signature pool wasn't crowded, but it was just a pool, whereas the MGM's was a lazy river, volleyball and tons of pools. Also the business center was mega expensive. We just wanted to print our boarding passes and it would have cost at least 10. But other than that service was great, the rooms were clean and modern, and super spacious. We would go back for sure!",2
"I enjoy a cup of Boba every now and then. Back in college it was an up and coming hot thing. So Starbucks vs. Boba was a daily debate. Boba Tea House wow what an original name! Yeahhhhh. As usual my boba selection was off the charts? Why so much flavor man? I only and always get the Thai Tea with Boba.might as well call it ""Bo's "" Ba . Service was easy going and I get my tea the way I want it. However, what's up with the A C? They have fans blowing left and right? Does making Boba take that much power that you have to switch off the A C? or does the salt water tank with the fish need to be at a certain temp? They have a leather couch, but no thanks I like the skin on my legs where they are. Not sure what's up, but I bet all their workers can't wait till the winter season enjoy!",2
"This is the only place I go to buy my boards and gear. I tried going to Big5, but the quality is average at best. Sports Chalet is ok, but their prices are too steep and don't have the professional help and knowledge that is needed for you to find the right board and gear. Then there is Powder and Sun, my go to place for all my snowboarding needs. The staff is super helpful, friendly and extremely knowledgable because everyone that works there are boarders and have a passion for it. Prices are very reasonable and post and pre season sales are the best! When you're ready to finally buy your own board or just pick up some new gear to feed your addiction, there isn't any better place to go than Powder and Sun.",2
"So, heard about this awesome local diner from other Yelpers. n nRobert, the owner, is super personable and it's obvious he takes pride in his food. He made a point of saying if anything was wrong to please let them know. Our waitress.I didn't catch her name.was super attentive and nice. n nI love their coffee AND they bring you your own carafe so you aren't waiting on refills. We tried the hash browns, biscuits gravy, maple bacon, and bulgogi sandwich with garlic fries. Everything was cooked perfectly. The maple back was the bomb.com. n nThe portions are large so we ended with to go containers. Everything heated up nicely for a great afternoon snack. n nThe inside of the diner is cutely decorated. Nothing fancy.I loved the blue wall. This will definitely be on my list of return places.",2
"We were recommended Del Friscos by a friend for a romantic dinner for two and it exceeded our expectations n to begin, they have a great cocktail list. Although it is pricey, the whole meal is quite pricey anyway n great wine list, decent prices if you buy a bottle n BEST steak I have ever eaten. Slices like butter and seriously melts in your mouth no exaggeration . We didn't want the steak to end and were savoring every moment! n Staff is very friendly and made our experience very memorable. We went on Valentine's Day which meant it was crazy busy but we could barely tell because our waiter gave us the right amount of attention. He even took some cute pictures of us for a memory n nWe will be going back for sure next time we are in Sin city!",2
"Certainly, the location comes across as the most beaten down strip mall in a city nicknamed Lost Wages. Come here in the heat of summer and likely you will feel that you and your party have stepped into a Post Nuclear Bomb movie your skin feels like 1,000 degrees and glowing. So the food would have to be the draw. And it is! This has some of the best Thai food in the ole' U.S. of A. note the original restaurant was in Hollywood, another city that has seen better days, so I have actually been eating here for two decades! The curry here is special, with the right level of heat. So enjoy those beads of sweat on your forehead, because they will cool you down when you walk back out into the furnace!",2
"Their staff are all so friendly and helpful. They are very eager to help you and answer any questions you might have. nI am not a frequent juicer because it is just too much work to juice at home. the preparation and clean up is just too much for me to justify. Which is why I love that juicerys are finally opening up in Vegas. n nThe prices here are reasonable.around 10 a juice with a ton of options for you to choose from. Unicorn's Blood is delicious! I see a lot of people have an issue with the fact that they bottle their juices, but I actually love that. I am there to grab what I need and go. If I wanted to watch a my juice be made in front of me, I'd do it at home. n nI'll definitely be back.",2
"This is one of my go to places in the market, I can't believe it's slipped through my Yelping fingers for so long! If you are visiting the market this is a delicious option for lunch, it's just a tiny counter with a ton of homemade sausages but they are always grilling some of their best and you can get them loaded up with kraut and hot peppers and mustards and a lovely toasted bun to walk around with, or park yourself on a stoop or picnic bench in the sun to people watch and enjoy the many live musicians who busk here. n nIf you are preparing a BBQ make this a stop for sure these are exceptional big fat tasty sausages of all kinds and flavours. I like the jalapeno and cheese and the beer sausage and you know, pretty much all of them.",2
"Really delicious cuppa joe here, so much so that grabbing it to go in environmentally friendly paper cups is fine but I go back on my own with new music in my headphones and a quiet hour ahead of me just to drink the coffee properly, sitting quietly, with a little cream and fresh chocolate chunk cookies as big as your face. n nI had a delicious vegetable Thai soup here today. I tried to order the French Onion but was told honestly that the soup on special was made fresh in house and the onion was bought in and. ""a good source of cheese. "" While I am always glad to know a cheese source, I will choose fresh homemade every time. I was not disappointed, the soup was amazeballs, and the service was 5 gold stars for honesty and accuracy in reporting.",2
"I had lunch at Capital Grill and was pleasantly surprised by the menu options that included fish and other non meat items. The service was impeccable from the moment we stepped into the restaraunt. I was surprised that it wasn't more crowded but there was an ice storm brewing outside, which could have forced people to stay in. Even though I begrudgingly went to Cap Grill because my boyfriend wanted a steak, I enjoyed myself just as much as he did. I had the salmon salad, which our waiter recommended, and was delicious, and my boyfriend had the filet, which he has never been disappointed by at any Cap Gill. The service stands out at Cap Grill and, as long as you're in the mood for deliciously prepared but simple dishes, you won't be disappointed.",2
"I will join the troves of people writing reviews for Cibo. By now, it's known that it one of the best places to eat in Phoenix. n nCibo's atmosphere is the best by far. Inside the ""house "" is quaint, and intimate. Perfect for a romantic date for two. The outside patio is lit well with stringed bulbs, great landscaping and the occasional live music. n nThe pizza is on par with Bianco. I recommend getting a pie per person so you can try a variety. Also, I usually prefer red pizzas, but the whites here at Cibo always end up being my favorite. n nThe crepe deserts, with fresh fruit and ice cream are beyond words. Save room, you must get it. n nI love brining out of towners here to show what Phoenix really has to offer. Not some chain restaurant in a strip mall.",2
"Crown Plazas are the top end of IHG's line of brands so I'm always pleased when I can stay at one at a decent rate. That was true here. n nI had a great time during my stay and everything was fine as expected for a high end property. n nHERE'S THE DEAL. This hotel was formally a Marriott and changed to Crowne Plaza in June of 2013. They are getting ready to start a multi million dollar remodel. My stay was before it started. n nIF YOU ARE CONTEMPLATING STAYING HERE, I'D GIVE THEM A CALL AND FIND OUT THE STATUS OF THE REMODEL BEFORE YOU COMMIT. YOU MAY GET A GREAT RATE BUT FIND YOURSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONSTRUCTION MESS! n nI love Crowne Plazas so I'll be checking myself and can't wait to see the end result.",2
"This place use to be downtown Urbana. I drove by one day when I came back to town, and noticed they were gone. Damn, I thought they closed down. Driving back, I was on University and noticed they had moved. Yay. I have always been a fan of the Record Swap. Before Exile opened they were one of the last independent music stores left in the area. The owner is a little odd and reserved, but I have always found him a likable guy when he opens up. He knows his stuff as well. n nAnyway, rows of used CD's, some new but not a ton of new releases. A bunch of vinyl. Some box sets up front. An awesome selection, I have even found some bootlegs here I can't get anywhere else. Vinyl is in good shape as well. I have always been a fan. Even though they have moved, the store has not changed one bit.",2
"This hotel is nice and has a lot of bars with sitting areas for lounging. The room is spacious and has a microwave and dishwasher. The shower and tub are huge. The food from room service is great, better than expected. Pool area is nice. I like the big screen TV's, pool tables, pingpong and Foosball. We didn't get to check out the club, Marquee as they're closed on Sundays. Boo! Service is not as good as I expected from such a nice hotel. I tried calling front desk two separate times and no one would pick up. I also had some issues checking in and out. I guess they are still working out the kinks as the hotel is brand spanking new. Overall a good hotel to stay in. Nice rooms and good location on the strip. They just need to improve on their front desk service.",2
"This was one of my favorite places to eat and drink on the strip. We first stopped by for breakfast, the wait was 25 minutes which is a bit long but understandable for a popular restaurant. We put our name in and went down to the casino to gamble a bit. We came back and we're sat within minutes. Our server Alonzo was helpful with directing us through the menu because I was very indecisive. I wish he warned us about portion size, had we know how big the plates were, we would have split an order. We went from starving to uncomfortable full with less than half the plate eaten. nWe also came back at 2 am because the place is 24hours. We ordered this particular bartenders signature margaritas and were not disappointed. The drink was made well and made this light weight pretty drunk.",2
"This hotel was recommended to us from family friends. It's about a 15min drive from the strip. The price is excellent and we found the hotel room to be large and very clean. The casino was nice and I was lucky enough to win a good bit of money. We only ate at the Coronado Cafe for breakfast. The food is pretty much like a Denny's, nothing special. We checked in on a Sunday night and there was a long line at the check in, but it seemed to move pretty fast. We didn't have a reservation and they accommodated us. There is a 14 fee per day for wifi and to use the fitness center. The pool area was also closed for the week so no such luck to check it out. I didn't access the theater or bowling alley but they are available.",2
"This event made me soooo happy! I found out about it from a retweet on Roaming Hunger's website. I'm from LA and have waiting in line forever for some of these trucks, so I knew I wanted to get there early. At an LA truck event I waited 2 hours for the Ludo truck and another hour to get my food. At this event there were 2 people in line.TWO! I win! I finally got to try The Chairman which was awesome but on pair with Great Bao here in Vegas. The Chairman was the only truck I tried that I hadn't been to before, but I'm glad I got to share my favorite out of town trucks with my Vegas friends! All in all a really great event with some of the best trucks in the country! I really hope South Point decides to make this an annual event!",2
"This is a must see when you are visiting Pittsburgh. The Duquesne incline is regarded as one of the top 10 city line views in the world, accordingly to USA Today. n nYou have two options to check out the incline, either park at the parking lot at the bottom of the incline on West Carson street or park at the top of the incline. During the summer season, parking at the top of the incline can be bleak. There is a private parking lot right across the incline that charges 10 day. n nInside the incline, there is a cute little museum where you get a bit of the history of the incline also you can see the 'inards' of the mechanical room. The view is pretty awesome from the top. n nDo not forget your camera!",2
"Based on a strong recommendation, Pane Bianco was one of the few spots I hit on a quick Arizona trip. Great little spot for simple sandwiches and a nice, fulfilling lunch which won't leave you feeling like junk afterwards. The fresh mozzarella is spot on what it should have tasted like, fresh, clean, and delicious. n nNot even a huge fan of basil or tomatoes, but you could tell they were very fresh and the entire thing just worked. The huge wood fired oven was pushing out hot bread like no one's business, and the entire experience was really great. What a lunch place should be. Plus, a nice little caramel in the bag to finish your meal. Would have liked to see some small pizza options on the menu, but then again, if you want pizza, there's always his other little restaurant.",2
I had a great lunch with my 3 month old the other day the staff was spectacular and I was accommodated with a booth for the car seat. I ordered the Barrel Burger which was very tasty seasoned well but my bun was falling apart but I managed to get it all down the pickle was good too. n I was super impressed with the design of the place with an open patio area cool furniture namely the cowhide bar stools. There was country music playing just loud enough to not wake a baby and I can't wait to go back for drinks and dinner with my wife maybe before the baseball game on St Patty's Day. It would be on my list to hit for drinks and a date for sure! n nWho ever designed this place gets 5 stars! n nI'll be back with friends and family.,2
"First time visit on a Friday evening. The happy hour is affordable and delicious. Drinks are imaginative and flavorful. The patio is comfortable and cozy with a fireplace and heaters. We sampled our way through appetizers of Mediterranean style meatballs, veggie flatbread, and goat cheese baked with fresh tomatoes. All were spectacular. Dinner salad was crisp and fresh, and the polenta was creamy good. Hubby had the risotto which was a bit salty to my palate, but appropriately creamy. Our friends had the salmon which was moist and flavorful, and the black rice shrimp bowl which was tangy and tasty. The only bummer was the chocolate cake. The gelato it came with was superb, but the cake was so dry. Sorry. We will definitely be back. Maybe the sticky toffee pudding next time.",2
"I moved out to San Tan Valley about 5 months ago. Our favourite take out chinese place was Red Dragon in Chandler and since it was too far away, we started looking around for something closer. Luckily we found the China Chef. We have ordered several things for take away as well as ate in and I have not had a single problem with any of the food there. My wife usually orders the General Tso chicken and I mix it up with a different dish everytime. I really like the war wan ton soup as well as the bourbon chicken. The rice is awesome and the noodles are great. The food is so good there, while I wrote this review I convinced myself to order something from them! Oh, and the prices are really good too.",2
"I love chipotle, especially for us Gluten Free and Vegan Folks. Their bowls are amazing, although I avoid eating corn, their corn tortillas are delightful. I usually just get a bowl with Brown Rice, lettuce, black beans, and guacamole. So yum! I like that they try and provide their customers with organic and or all natural produce at all times possible. That alone shows me they care about their customers. The staff at this location have always been very friendly. The food is great, the staff is wonderful but the down side is the parking lot. Very small and tight. It usually isn't too big of a hassle to handle, but sometimes I've had to wait a few minutes to be able to park. In the mood for some simple, but very tasty food? Chipotle is the answer.",2
