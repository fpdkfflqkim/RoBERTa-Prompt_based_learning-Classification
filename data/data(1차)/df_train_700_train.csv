"Same as the reviews before me very disappointed. I had purchased a Living Social after being impressed with Jones' website. Unfortunately, her customer service was horrible we never got a chance to see the same quality photos that are displayed on her website. She cancelled, she didn't return calls, she didn't return emails, or texts. She lacked common courtesy. to the point I wondered if she was just ""screwing "" with me? I don't think I've received worse service in the online shopping era? Where most legitimate businesses depend on positive feedback, it was obvious that she did not care. I expected quality pictures, I got disrespected.",1
"I wish we would've just gone to our old standby Tamba which was not even a block from the hotel, but the wife who NEVER wants to try anything new wanted to try a new Indian restaurant. The service was somewhat inattentive. We had hot supposedly Chai tea, but no one brought out any kind of sweetener until we requested some. I should've had a nice cold Taj Mahal beer. The food was just fair with the standout being the malai kofta. The tandoori mixed grill lamb and swordfish and saag paneer were pretty bland. I've had way better food back home in Maryland. They spoiled me rotten apparently. Next time we're in Vegas and want Indian we know where NOT to go.",1
"You are more likely to find an abandoned poopy diaper in the corner of a dressing room here than something actually worth buying. Back in the day, this used to be THE place to find awesome vintage tees and dresses in Vegas, but now it's just overpriced, lame shit absolutely nothing is vintage, all the potentially valuable stuff is sold to dealers, and none of it is properly inspected for damage before being put on the racks. A lame waste of time unless you are looking for a six year old 10 BCBG top with yellow armpit stains, or a used cum stained nighty that's right folks, they have an entire lingerie section full of USED UNDERWEAR . This place is just one big abandoned poopy diaper.",1
"Ok breakfast not so much my toast must have been toasted and then sat for twenty minutes while they made my breakfast the home fries are cut up French fries I ordered the skillet with peppers onions and sausage when it came out 20 plus minutes later not overly hot no eggs I guess it doesn't come with eggs. My wife had the egg sandwich which she said was ok when it was time to pay I gave the server 20 dollar bill on a 16 dollar tab she said thank you and never came back with my change so I could decide on the tip it would have probley been 2 dollars not 4 . Consistency people like I said in my last review good wings beer and salad, breakfast jury's still out",1
"Terrible experience. Horrible service. I know it's New Years Eve, and we had a reservation for 8 00pm. We were sat at 8 05. It's now 9 35 and we have only received our drinks. Other tables that were seated after us are eating. The manager came over and said there was a miscommunication between the hostess and the server and then he walked away. Bullshit! I'll never return here again. If I knew we could eat at another restaurant this evening, I'd walk out. POOR MANAGEMENT. n nUPDATE After 2 hours, and not even a second round of drinks, we DID walk out. Now eating at Chili's. Great service here.",1
"I had one of the worst experiences as a customer at this establishment. I was looking forward to enjoying Sunday football after my husband told me what a great time he had last year. Once we arrived we were greeted by hostile and visibly stressed hostesses. The seating system is HEAVILY flawed, there is no reason that a Vegas establishment has not figured out an efficient manner in which to service guests. The servers were all passive aggressively hostile as well. They have a 50 minimum per customer and treat you like you like they could care less whether you are satisfied or not. I will NEVER return and would recommend that you take your business elsewhere.",1
"The room was completely out dated way over priced. I could have stayed in a much more modern two room suite for the same price elsewhere. The tv was pathetically old, the shower was made for a midget I am just over 6 feet tall it hit my shoulders , and to top it all off they turned the water off on me for a couple of hours one day! n nThey were apparently working on the wing they put me in because there was a lot loud noises all week long. n nFor the inconvenience they offered me 15 off my NEXT stay but rest assured I will not be staying there again. I'd rather stay at Treasure Island or Planet Hollywood Westgate.",1
"Well along with the others, I don't have much good to say. Parking if course is crappy, but could be much worse. Not sure what we got for the admission. All the four was pretty overpriced along with drinks. All activities cost extra. We got there at 5 45 and every vendor our kids went up to were out of candy already. 4000 lbs, it says on the website? Gone in an hour? Hmm. Also very crowded and the damn people that think they need to bring a stroller the size of a SUV, can kiss my ass. I can't count how many times I was run into. Made an amusement park on a holiday weekend look pleasant. Won't be back.",1
"SAVE YOUR MONEY HONEY! n nFor 3 people we spent 95 all to look at computer screens? Ok you start off with a crime scene and then you go from computer to computer to ""Solve the case. "" which could have been a fun concept if it weren't for the fact that its programmed to solve it for you. OK fun right. n nSo basically all you do is go from one computer station to another click a mouse and boom that's your ""CSI Experience "" The kicker is you get a diploma afterwards which is an EXTRA 5.95 nope they couldn't include that piece of paper in the 95 they initially charged. n nRIP OFF n nMe id rather watch paint dry.",1
"You have to sign a waiver when you register, stating you will not sell drugs or prostitue yourself out of the hotel room. Wow. n nKilled a roach by the bed, another in the bathroom. n nThere were what looked like bloodstains on the wall, some kind of fungus hanging out of the faucet in the bathroom sink, pubic hairs on the tile in the shower, and a USED bar of soap still in the shower. n nThe air conditioning unit on the wall wasn't fitted properly we could see through it out into the parking lot while lying in bed. It made oven knobs for dials. n nThe curtains were tied back with trash can liners. n nHorrific experience.",1
"The food was ok but the service was terrible. We went around 2 30pm and the place was dead. So you would think we would have attentive service, but no. Also we told them we had never been there before. So we were surprised when the service was so bad. After we got our food we hardly ever saw our waitress. I never even had my water refilled. The when we left the hostess and other worker she was talking to didn't even turn to tell us anything when we left. Not a good way to get us to come back. nThe only reason I gave it two stars was because the food was pretty good. A little expensive for the generic Chinese lunch specials.",1
"Their website pretty clearly states they prefer appointments to walk ins. So I call up to set up a consultation appointment with EZ, and the guy who answers my phone says, ""Um, you have to come in to talk to someone. "" n n ""Wait, I have to come in to set up an appointment? "" n n ""Um, yeah. "" n nSo they want appointments but won't schedule appointments over the phone. I don't know how anyone else feels about that, but I don't have the time nor patience to play guessing games about how and who I need to speak to just to set up a CONSULTATION appointment. It was enough to make me seek another shop.",1
"Located in GVR, it's one of the options in their food court. n nI was with some friends and we wanted to grab a quick bite. Service was good. We sat at the counter in front of the cooks and they were all very friendly and chatty. n nIt was my first experience eating a fatburger and probably my last. I ordered the small burger and skinny fries. The taste of the burger was too salty. Good thing I had water to help it go down. I was really disappointed with it. The skinny fries were good. Crispy and a good amount. n nFortunately there are other good places to eat in GVR. As far as Fatburger, thumbs down.",1
"Rip Off! n nI came here on a Saturday morning and tried their breakfast burritos. I ordered three Loretos breakfast specials. There supposed to have egg, potato, bacon, and cheese. I paid over 15 bucks for three. I came home and opened my burrito and all there was was potatoes sprinkled with little bacon bits, and very little visible egg. My wifes and daughters burritos all were the same, All potato very very little egg sprinkles. I could have gone to the store and made potato burritos myself and well under 15 bucks! nIf all the rest of their food is this bad, I will not go back! n nRip Off! If I could give Zero stars I would.",1
"I ordered the Red Velvet pancakes, but they were undercooked and tasted horrible after 3 bites I gave up. My Dad ordered the Chocolate french toast which was 1big slice of brioche bread which was very dry in the center. The only good thing we ordered was the Banana Split for 2. Service was great but then again the place was pretty empty in the afternoon. Booths are comfortable, bar stools look very uncomfortable and no way would I sit at the tables some of which are uneven. I would go back only for desert or one of the overpriced large drinks. This review is for the Town Square location sorry.",1
"Staff was quick, especially considering the line they had. I don't do coffee, so I can't speak to that, but the tea was good of course it's pretty hard to mess up black tea . n nI don't recommend their hot food items though. I ordered the egg, ham cheese croissant for 8. The outside was super hot, which I thought was a good sign. However the middle was cold I am not a fan of cold egg. For 8 and a 10 minute wait I expected my food to be cooked through. n nI didn't have time to ask for a replacement because it was time for my plane to board, so maybe they would have done a better job the second time. If I ever end up here again, I'm define tell grabbing one of the cold items.",1
"I've been to this location 4 times and they got my order wrong 3 times AND made me late returning from lunch. I don't expect much, I mean it's not Le Cordon Bleu but it's not rocket science either. I go out of my way to avoid fast food but had time constraints on my visits so had no alternative. n nThe last guy at the window was in a spectacular mood. So much so that I was prompted to ask him if he was medicated and if so, to give me his doctor's phone number. He laughed and said he loves his job. Wrap your mind around that. He amused me for the rest of my time in the Gulag that pays my bills. He got my order right for a change so I was pleased.",1
"This show was definitely NOT what we are used to for comedy.the reason.comedy was absent. n nIf you are looking for stand up comedy, improvisational or not, this is not the place. This is a comedy troupe being generous on the word comedy here. . There are no tables, just rows of chairs.but that is because there is no drink service. This is more geared to the 12 20 crowd, with sodas and candy bars for sale, and simply some place to hang out on a Saturday night.And this was the ""late "" show. n nReally wish we could get back that 90 minutes of life.but it is gone forever. The place was full largely 12 25 crowd. So, someone likes it.but we will not be back.",1
"Ok , here's the break down. n 20 early check in fee . Wtf never heard of that. n 25 resort fee. This is for your ""free wifi "" and you get speeds of 512 kb with it. Is this the 1990's ?! nIn this day in age wifi should be free and fast. Couldn't even look a picture on sites like this one due them taking forever to load. nAs for the rooms they are super dated and run down. This hotel needs a serious facelift. nThe only reason I did not give it one star was its location on the strip and the miracle mile mall is a great place to walk around , have a drink and people watch. nNext trip it will be back to the Cosmo.",1
"Groupon offered a 1 lunch deal yesterday at Rosatis, so I thought I'd give them a second chance. It turns out I just wasted my time. When I showed up to pick up my order I was told that my 1 deal was supposed to be a 15 deal and that if I wanted to pay an extra 14 I could get my food. This is wrong on several levels, one of them being that it seems pretty obvious they were trying to cheat Groupon. Venders get 50 of the Groupon price, so if it was really 15, they would have only received 7.50. n nI left without my food, which I assume they had to throw away, because they wouldn't honor their Groupon.",1
"Went to Casbah on a recent Saturday night we were seated upstairs which is a very pretty, well lit casual space. My friend and I ordered the vegetarian platter for two but they were out of tabouli and substituted something . The hummus and baba ghanouj were very good, pitas were plentiful, the falafel pucks were interesting, but overall the quality of the food was mediocre. Not awful, but not memorable. Service, though was memorable and not in a good way. I get that the building is multi storied, and maybe that's why it takes so long to get your drinks or more pita, or your check. n nI won't say we'll never be back, I'm just not in a hurry.",1
"On a personal scale I'd give this a 2 but Yelp said ""Meh, I've experienced better "" and that's not what 2 means to me. 2 means ""don't go here "" where as 1 means ""avoid at all costs "" but Yelp makes it sound like 2 okay to go but not great so 1 it is. n nI only ordered 1 thing. Their Meat Monger Omelet and it must have been the absolute driest omelet I've ever been served. I don't know how someone could eat it. We asked them for some sauce in order to salvage it but where told breakfast ended at 11am it was 11 10am and that all the sauces were gone. Only salsa and ketchup was available. We finally figured on some mayo to make it edible but we'll definitely never be back.",1
"I DO NOT recommend getting an oil change here. My wife has taken our car here two times. Each time she has been tricked into buying services that are unneeded. n nJust last week, she took our car there for an oil change. While there, our car would not start so the employees gave her a jump start. When she brought the car home I noticed that there was acid seeping out of the top of the battery. The employees did not mention this and we could see where they had attached the cables to the acid burned part of the battery. n nI also noticed that the coolant tank was completely empty. WTF? n nWoodman's East is a much better place to get an honest oil change.",1
"Decided to try the Quad for the 1st time and will never do it again! Don't be fooled by he casino style down stairs, the rooms look completely different! I was under the impression that the rooms were renovated and updated nope! Elevators are old and scary, all the hallways and rooms have stains everywhere! IThe rooms are like a motel 6, dirt, things broken and just definitely not what was expected. This is not clear on the website either! I will never come back here, worth a little more money to stay somewhere nicer! Wanted to try something knew, but wished I didn't. It reeks of weed everywhere too! No air flow and people smoking weed around every corner! Not okay!",1
"My husband, a friend, and myself went there for fish on black Friday. We were surprised that it was not very busy so we thought we would get service pretty quickly. We sat at a table near the salad bar and waited.and waited. and waited. We saw one server and also saw another table waiting for service as well. The waitress never once acknowledged that we were sitting there and she had to pass our table to to wait on another table. All the waitress had to do was say she would be right with us.or SOMETHING. After waiting a half hour with no word from the waitress, we got up and left. Murphy's Bar was way more accommodating.",1
"IT'S A TRAP! This place has the WORST service. The waiters and waitresses pressure you in to ordering a two drinks minimum the ENTIRE time you are there. The food is decent, mostly fried bar food. They share a kitchen with a bar with 60 beers on tap and NONE of them are available to order. You can only order beer from a bottle or watered down well drinks. I will NEVER go back to this place. As much as a like comedy, it's not worth the money. I wouldn't have gone the last time if they didn't trick me in to free tickets. Why pay for something I can watch on Comedy Central at home with the beer of my choice?",1
"Took my mom for Mother's Day after seeing a show at Paris. The popovers were outstanding. Flaky, Cheesy, Salty Deliciousness. We shared the Bone In Rib eye which took almost 45 minutes to be served, and it was undercooked. Although it was very flavorful, it was not a good cut of meat. I am not sure if I have ever seen a tendon in the middle of a rib eye, but this one had a large one running through it. It was overall a fatty piece of steak. The Bone In at Joe's is far superior for the same price. The service was slow even though there were many servers present. Did I mention the popovers were amazing? Probably would not go back.",1
"I so wanted to like this place for many reasons. n nBut what a disappointment! n nThe retro building and decor is pretty cool 1 star . Kevin Sousa opening up another spot in East Lib, very cool 1 star . n nBut the hot dogs were lackluster. nBad bun. nSad, soggy toppings on the New York Dog and Chili Cheese Dog. nSoggy, bland fries. nAnd it's all overpriced for soggy, smooshy, dogs. n nI might go back to check it out when they get beer.hopefully the menu will improve over time. I had high expectations for this place after dining at Salt. n nIf you're craving a hot dog, D's in Regent Square still reigns supreme.for now at least.",1
"Only one star because it won't let me give none. n nI was so excited to come for Brunch You in the Eye and loved the environment. We waited over one hour for our food. Our server Caitlin was very attentive and fretted over the massive delay. But no one around us had food either. When I asked to speak with a manager, Ann Marie was defensive and unhelpful to even explain why no one had food and what the delay was. Ann Marie threw our server under the bus and made no attempts to solve the issue besides telling us hat it's be another 15 minutes. Caitlin kept apologizing but Ann Marie was I incredibly unprofessional and rude. n nI'll never go again which is a shame since they have great music.",1
"I do not like coming to this one. Do not like it at all! I come here because it is half way between where I live and my friend lives. Two stars because they are remodeling soon! Thank God for that! It looks like they are making some huge changes! nAs for now it doesn't look like this gym has had any sort of updates since it opened. It's dirty, it smells.ugh nI can't tell you how any of the staff is because I never see any one working there except the front desk clerk who completely ignores me to talk to his friends. I just found out theres another location less than two miles away, We will go to that one and hope they start and finish the remodel at this one soon!",1
"Been here several times, kids love the pizza, but the service is HORRIBLE. On our last visit we waited 20 mins to be greeted.with 2 small kids and weren't given any kid menus or crayons. Gave server drink and food order all at once thinking it would speed things up.NOT. From when we walked in the door it was 45 mins before our 8 "" kid pizza and 2 side salads with grilled chicken came?!? Ridiculous, I've been a server for many years, been swamped, but to not apologize or send a manager or discount is a horrible way to get repeat business and customer recommendations as a newer restaurant. Would rather get dominos in half the time and price.",1
"Sorry, I had to subtract because I came in here for lunch with a coworker. we ordered at the same time. his meal came out quickly. mine did not. My plate came out about 10 minutes after his. n nYesterday, I brought my roommate in for dinner. Again! his meal came out first, and mine was late! Only 5 minutes this time. but still. Neither of our meals were anything special. I had the roasted duck. Menu say half duck. I got part of a thigh, and more bones than meat on my plate. My buddy got a seared lamb dish which he said just did not taste good. Step Your Game Up Tao Garden. I will be back to check on you for lunch someday ",1
"John Rader was my CPA for the past five years. I trusted him and referred him to many others. I am very conservative with my taxes and they are not very complicated. Within the last year I have been contacted by the IRS on two occasions for mistakes he made on my taxes from years back. Now I'm paying penalties and have a huge tax bill to pay. Additionally, I have asked him to resolve the mistakes which he admitted to . His resolutions have been declined by the IRS each time. Just a warning, he may not have always been on his game, and you might want to have a professional review your taxes from previous years. My apologies to anyone I referred to him.",1
"Unlike other reviewers, I found the service to be good which is the reason for two stars. The food, however, was not good. The burrito tasted like campbell's chicken soup or probably a lot of corn starch and chicken bouillion mixed with water really. I know food and I love food and did not expect high end based on the prices but did expect good taste did not get it. The menu needs a lot of work. People who go to mexican food restaurants REALLY DO want mexican food but it seems this restaurant thinks it needs to cater to an american neighborhood grill with bland taste and NO authentic taste whatsoever.",1
"I purchased a groupon for a cut and color. I brought my iPad with several hair styles I had that I have loved in the past. I made it very easy for a good stylist however the cut was uneven and the color was really very, very dark it was very bad! I not only paid for the groupon and had to pay an additional 30.00 for what he called highlights! I ended up going to Supercuts and they were able to straighten out the cut and redid the highlights! It looks great now. I am very upset that I wasted money on Crimpers! Bad place and the owner Frank was the guy who did my hair. Don't waste your money! I will be calling for a refund!",1
"The clinic in this location is a joke. I got there right at opening and waited for an hour and 45 mins. When I finally got seen she said ""oh, im sorry you must have left. "" Umm no, I have been sitting in the same chair for almost 2 hours. She then sent me home with the DX of ""allergies "" and ""no sign of infection "" she was nice enough to give me a referral to a real doctor though. I went there later that same day and tested positive for Strep and also had a really bad ear infection. Needless to say I hope you choose somewhere else for your care needs. This place was a complete joke. I will stick with someone who knows that Motrin and Tylenol are different medications.",1
"Even if you had the ""Buffet of Buffets "" pass, I'd recommend checking out other places before here. For the regular price, I do not recommend coming here. I'd rather eat one nicer dish at a restaurant. n nAll I ate here were some fruits and the rosemary chicken. Yes it was good but for 35? Hell no. And yes, you are in Las Vegas so there is a higher standard for buffets. So, if you've ate there and didn't think it was bad, you are correct. It is not bad at all. But, as a Las Vegas buffet, it sucked. Very disappointing, since I love the Caesars Palace. You'd think their buffet would be as grand as their hotel.",1
"I went in for a simple trim. They get an extra star for offering me water. n nIf you're Asian and used to getting your haircuts with Asian styling AVOID AT ALL COSTS. n nThis lady cut off 1 1 2 more inches that was necessary because she didn't know what layers was for Asian hair. By the time I got to tying up my hair I'd realized the hair cut was as if she was just chopping it off for a donation to Locks of Love. n nI had to go to Beauty2Beauty to get it fixed. n nThey have a nice atmosphere in the salon and would encourage everyone who doesn't care for the style of cutting to go but ASIAN FEMALES, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1
"Went in today to eat dinner, and was seated promptly. However, after that waiters seemed to wander around. To clarify, there were around 20 guests and 3 or so waiters. The waiters gathered by the bar and talked with each other as we sat there. 10 minutes went by and nobody even looked at our table. So we got up and walked out, and a waiter waved like he had no idea we hadn't been served. n nTake this with a grain of salt, because to me, service is so important. I'm in business, and you can easily lose or gain customers by being respectful or showing no regard for customer service. Hope they remedy this.",1
"Not a terrible experience but not an amazing one. I like LAX as my favorite airport. The wifi is speedy and sso are the check ins. San Deigo has a good airport. I didn't check in so I have never waited in line at TSA. I have had this as a stop over ALOT because I've flown US airways a million times. n nIts wifi its spotty. It restaurants are over prices for a state that ends in Carolina. Also no place to plug in devices like Phoenix, Salt Lake, and LA. And the seats are CERTAINLY not designed for sleeping. n nEhh. okay I guess i can't rank the full experience but I assume it never get really busy. for check in and security.",1
"The food itself would get 4 5 stars. The only reason why I am giving this place 2 stars is because of the shitty management. it was out 1st time going here. Our original waiter looked very flustered so midway through, a new server told us he will be taking over. We orderd our food and the new waiter you can just tell was very overwhelmed. Not only that but the manager yelled at him in the middle of the resturant, which is the most unprofessional thing a manager can do. towards the end of our meal, we paid and on the receipt i wrote to the waiter ""Sorry about your shitty managment, you did nothing wrong. "" and left him a big tip.",1
"FYI This is a review exclusively for lunch, I have no clue what dinner is like, but here is my review for the lunch This place is definitely more focused on their banquet hall that it's attached too than service for guests at lunch, we popped infor their ""lunch buffet "" which was basically a table with some banquet sterno heated trays with some mediocre indian paki cuisine. service didn't exist and we had to ask for everything. The only reason I'm writing a review is to give the naan bread my thumbs up, but for neverything else, there are SO MANY other options available in the area, skip this place as a lunch option if you can, or pop in just for some naan.",1
"This place is nasty. Everything was way too salty. We ordered the seared scallops in romesco sauce. Can you believe that the sauce was bland compared to how salty the scallops were? The scallops were as salty as the fried bacalao. The paella valenciana with chicken and rabbit was tasteless. The chicken was super dry, more like chewy rubber, and i did not see a bit of rabbit in our plate either. And the ""fresh "" squid in squid ink was nasty. Seriously don't order that. The only thing decent was the goat cheese with fig jam, which I highly doubt those were made in house. That's only for the food. The prices are high, which i don't mind paying, but at least give me something edible.",1
Drove all the way over to this place for a consult for color and cut after I told them on the phone what I wanted they told me they could do it but couldn't get a appointment for three weeks obviously I'm not going to wait that long could they have told me on the phone thanks for wasting my time really who's that busy I see they don't do a good job anyways after some reveiws I missed earlier thank goodness I decided to go somewhere else that actually can color my hair right the first time also told me I would need three appointment to get it the color right all I was trying t o die my hair red,1
"This company was the plumber sent out by Old Republic Home Warranty. They botched the job from minute one. I told them it was a leak in the wall, and their tech worked on the toilet, completely ignoring the leak in the wall. After several calls most not returned , a go back on the TOILET, I finally had to call the warranty company to get action. It took over two months, and now there is a bill of over 4000 dollars in mold remediation from the WALL LEAK that was right next to the toilet that they fixed that wasn't broken. I agree with someone below, if zero were an option, that would be the choice.",1
"Be ware things are not so warm and fuzzy anymore. I tried in vain to book an ticket, tried to use rapid rewards, then tried to buy the ticket, then called. The call center acknowledged that the system was down and there was nothing they would or could do just call back the next day when the fairs jumped up another tier. We had everything loaded, rate was locked in credit car was logged in and whamo we were cut off. Naturally I called and got a supervisor's supervisor, Omar, I believe and he callously blew me off and eventually hung up.Oh and did I mention this was the only direct flight left, not quite the Keller era anymore.",1
"I really despise this radio station and I think I speak for everyone else. First off, they play the same ol pop music on rotation. Hip hop and r b? What a joke of selection they play. I like rap and r b but I would like this station even more if they showed a bit more creativity for example, it wouldn't hurt to hire some skilled djs that mixed live on the air. I don't mean by playing a mix of random songs but by truly mixing and scratching. Theyre current dj's suck in my opinion. 975 would gain so many listeners if this was done. Also, they like to follow other radio stations by playing the same old music. Please show some creativity and be bold, do not follow.",1
"The receptionist was not friendly, and wears no name tag so I didn't know who was greeting me. She actually never said ""hello "" and never smiled. n nLong wait times, so schedule when you have a lot of time and bring a good book. n n n nThe doctor removed several freckles for no reason at all apparently, because she didn't explain why, leaving me with scars that I did not want. n nCan't say this was a good experience and I won't be back. nLook for a doctor who thoroughly explains what she is doing and why. I prefer a doctor who answers questions thoroughly, especially since the wait time was so long. I expected better quality of service during my visit but was very disappointed.",1
"Stay away from this store. The manager is rude, a fraud, and arrogant! They talked us into a plan that costs me 600 for a cell phone. I had no idea that I was paying that, the 'installments "" were supposed to be at the discounted price 199 . We went to Corporate who agreed with me and logged a complaint against the store. The manager had the ability to right the wrong but refused! Unless you just are paying for something off the shelf and you know the price stay away from contracts. The manager wanted us to sit down with the sales person and discuss because it was not his problem. Bad Bad bad. nThankfully Corporate helped us to defer costs",1
POOR customer service! Nancy at the front desk was so rude and only told us what couldn't be done. I stayed in the honeymoon suite for our wedding night. The room was nice other than the film of dirt in the spa tub. So we avoided that. We ordered bottled water from room service that night wedding and dancing leaves you thirsty! . Room service never came that night. I had to send my husband downstairs to go to the vending machine. Overall I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone due to the lack of hospitality. You can get friendlier service at a budget hotel. I 2048 east cairo dr. I spent too much money on this room for such a poor experience.,1
"Obviously the burgers are banging. It's the premier place to have a high class burger, which is my favorite food. n nWith the burgers we had the sriracha chicken wings and steakhouse mushrooms. The wings were tasty and had a sweet and spicy sauce on them. Reccomended. The mushrooms were underwhelming. Big slices of portobello mushrooms in thick, heavy beer batter. I didn't know they'd be cooked like that the mushrooms were lost in the batter which was a big grease ball without taste of its own. n nIf you can stand the wait to get in, get yourself down to burgatory. Just don't order the mushrooms. ",2
"I go here all the time because n n1. It's always busy, that means food is good. n n2. The bean sprouts and basil in the side are always fresh. The ingredients are fresh. Order something beside pho and taste the fresh ingredients. They don't have to put too much seasoning. ""FRESH! "" n n3. They have the pickled jalape u00f1o jar. I'm Thai, we Thais need something other than siracha. I only wish they had fresh ground chili. n n4. Service is simple, they just take order and you get up and pay at counter, I like that. So the food is not expensive and one does not need to leave a huge tip. n nI love this place. I seriously do. I just wish they had sandwiches too. Then my life would be complete.",2
"I went here for a girl's night out. We had a great time. It was a party of 8, so they allow a call ahead 30 minutes before your arrival. We walked right in to our table, in a very crowded Restaurant on a Saturday night. I had a pear cider, which was really delicious. I have been craving it again, but can't find it anywhere. We ordered appetizers, the spinach dip, nachos. They were pretty good. But the chopped salad was delicious. It comes with a tomato gazpacho dressing, which I substituted for balsamic vinaigrette. Then I tasted the gazpacho dressing and it was really great, I will definitely try it next time. I love the selection of beers and the service was great.",2
"My son daughter and their families took me to Lucille's for a surprise birthday dinner. This was my first time there, but my daughter family had eaten there before. We had 9 in our party and no one had any problems with the service or food, everything was ""great ""! I grew up in Texas where BarBQue is King, but the food at Lucille's is as good or better. I had their fried okra, the best I've ever eaten! I also had the smoked beef brisket, it was so gooood. Their sweeten iced tea comes with mint and served in a gigantic mason jar, the flavor was unbeatable. I look forward to going back again the next time in Henderson.",2
"Pros nThe best mall in Vegas. nMore accessible than the Forum Shops. nBest Macy's and best Dillard's in Vegas, as well as the only Nordstrom location. n nCons nOverpriced. nToo many tourists. nKind of stuck up snobby atmosphere. nConfusing layout. nAlso, I happen to be a black kid and there's several stores where I was watched like a hawk and followed around as if they were waiting for me to steal something.just throwing that out there. n nBest mall in Vegas but it's not my favorite. I can never afford anything, almost every time I go here it's just for job hunting or to go window shopping. It can be fun, but it's also very depressing.",2
"Swanky little place to grab a drink and a bite. n nMet up with some of the Yelperazzi for some fun. I highly enjoyed the Basil x2 drink. I was not hungry, but what people were noshing on looked sublime and were received with happy nods and mmm's. For the high quality the prices seem very fair so I will be making a point to come eat soon. n nWe went on a unusual night with a work party there so it was crowded and loud before they left and it seems the usual is a quiet little bar to catch up with friends, good for a date or a respectable work meeting. n nI like the Royal house House and what they offer, this is definitely a reason to visit.",2
"Since going under new management recently, this establishment has transformed. The owner who is always there is very friendly and energetic. He really takes his time to welcome customers and explain the menu options, which I give him a lot of credit for. n nI usually go during my lunch break and get the 'grilled hot dog special' which comes with cole slaw, a pickle, fries, and a drink for six bucks. The food is good and well priced even their cole slaw is awesome. They are very generous with their toppings, which they very much encourage you to use but do not charge for. n nTo sum it up, it is a very comfortable place to be in with good food.",2
"I've been going to Belly Bliss since I was pregnant with my daughter 2 years ago. My first experience was with RoseMarie who was awesome! I say was because she has moved on to become a lactation consultant. I had some of the best facials with Zana who was amazing, unfortunately she also has moved on. I have not had the time to try anyone else and honestly I've been a bit hesitant.Only because I really would hate to be disappointed by my favorite place. I wish they have Pedicures as well.sigh. n nThe staff has always been kind and helpful and I really enjoyed being able to look around at baby boutique.",2
"I'm very picky when it comes to stylists. I have long, long thick curly hair and Casey at Tonic always does a great cut and smooth blow out. She even took extra time for me to show me how to curl my hair like the Kardashians I was blessed to find her. I saw several stylists before I came in to Tonic and was not happy with their style. How can you mess up a side swept bang? Casey has great technique, great customer service and is very personable. n nThe salon itself is inviting and not stuffy at all. Love the vibe in the room! There's so much talent and professionalism on the floor. It's trendy and comfortable too. n nGreat value for the full experience. You won't be disappointed!",2
"We have been here several times with family and for the romantic dinner for two and found both experiences outstanding. In Scottsdale we often forego inflated pricing for a sub par dining experience not so here. While you will certainly pay top prices you will also get what you pay for. Delicious steaks, sea food and interesting appetizers. Did I say delicious I meant it! Without doubt one of the best ribeye steak dinners in the valley cooked to perfection, tender and full of flavor and you can choose from 3 or 4 different topping schemes depending on your mood. Fantastic decor great service need I say more. If your in Cave Creek looking for a great meal search no further than Cartwrights.",2
"divine coffee in a boring neighborhood. n ndepending on the time and what day you go, place can be buzzing or entirely dead. i got the dead time of day. but the mirrored wall is quite welcomed when its dead. it gives you company! sure, it may be you looking back at yourself while some awesome music is playing in the background. its better than nothing! n ncoffee is totally divine. loved their espresso even though it is more acidic than i'm used to but nonetheless, good stuff! n ni wouldn't go out of my way to hang but in the neighborhood? definitely the top coffee stop. who knew there would be awesome coffee in the old montreal area?",2
My husband and I had some time to kill while waiting for his glasses to be prepared at Lenscrafters. An associate there recommended Granite City so we thought we would check it out. The food was delicious and the staff friendly. Unfortunately there must have been a mixup in the kitchen as we waited well over half an hour to get our food. My steak and baked potato were piping hot but my husband's ribs and mashed potatoes were stone cold. Our waitress was very apologetic and immediately remedied the situation. The manager also stopped by and made things right for us. We will definitely give them another chance. We left with the feeling of being very well cared for.,2
"Really fun atmosphere for a fast food counter service kind of place w a drive through. Jumbo hot dogs are super yummy, service is always great, employees are courteous, etc. n nThe only thing I think sucks is that these super nice employees are forced to stand out in the AZ heat to take the drive through orders. What happened to the old fashioned speaker systems. I feel so sorry for them. I think that is really stupid and sad. They say it gets orders processed and out quicker, but I don't see how it could really make that much of a difference. I wish they would change their policy on this. They are out there even when it's not super busy for no apparent reason.",2
"I went in today to pick up some shoe polish for two pairs of shoes. The guy that helped me was very honest about what would and wouldn't work for me and the products they offered. He also ended up telling me to wait or suggested two other shops that might have the colour I needed, rather than ruin the colour I wanted. I definitely plan on waiting and bringing my business back here. n nI definitely agree with Jessica that the younger guy that works here seemingly every day is amazing at his customer service. He took the time to address each customer in the shop and offer advice for each situation. He clearly knows his craft well and is proud about the services that the shop can offer.",2
"One thing that I love about Emiliano's is the serving sizes. I am a pretty hefty eater, but I know that when I go here I will leave with a full stomach, and sometimes even some leftovers. n nThe prices are pretty good. Upon glancing at the menu one might think that they're a little high, but for the amount of food you get, it's a good price. n nThe food is also pretty good. I've never really had anything I didn't like, and I've tried the tacos, flautas, burritos, arroz con pollo and more. Then again, I've never had anything that's completely wowed me either, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5. n nOverall, Emiliano's is a nice restaurant with some buena comida.",2
"This is a super high end sports bar very different from your typical sports book in Vegas and certainly pricey, but worth it for the experience. n nWe went to watch the Seahawks Sunday Night football game we had a blast as most of the fans were Hawks fans We paid the 100 cover for the reserved stadium seating, but they also have many other seating options including private rooms. The only challenge is trying to spend the full cover definitely come hungry and ready to drink! n nService was excellent throughout the game, and if you needed a break, there's a full sports book and a side room with craps and blackjack. n nWould definitely come back for more sports viewing!",2
"This is my friend Noah's favourite place in all the land and you know what, he's pretty much right. The staff is funny and charming, the room is mellow and unfancy, and the chicken thali is massive and crazy delicious. There probably is no better deal in town for under ten bucks. My friend ordered the vegetarian and this was a bit of a disappointment to be honest, kinda tasteless compared to the bangin delight of the butter chicken. But the naan and lentils were still perfect and pleasing, and we had sour fresh lime juice that made the muggy outside world fade from memory just long enough for us to feel floaty and happy, and very lucky to be lunching at Sana on Jarry. Go!",2
"I have not been to Roberto's in a very long time. This is pretty close to my house and the workers wanted this for their lunch so I decided to hit it up. n nI love that you can call ahead and place your order. It is so much faster than waiting around at the gas station. I had a very large order and they got everything right. No screw ups, I was shocked. n nYou can't go wrong with the 1 shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada w beans and rice or the carne asada burritos. Those burritos are huge and oh so good. n nDon't forget the salsa and bag of carrots and peppers before you leave. You can't eat a Roberto's meal without those.",2
"Clean location, friendly staff and great work! If you can, ask for Sandy. She is super friendly and extremely thorough. I have gotten manicures, pedicures, Gelish polish, acrylic nails and eyebrow waxing done here and I have been extremely happy 99 of the time. n nThe only time I was disappointed was when I got my Gelish polish done for the first time. A decent sized chunk chipped off the following day. However, I went back and explained what happened they remembered me from the previous day as well! . They fixed the polish for free and it hasn't chipped again since. That was almost TWO WEEKS ago! n nI will never get my nails done anywhere else in Vegas!",2
"I had a blast when I went to Tao Beach. Went there on a Saturday and I fell in love! We had a Cabana and the waitreses were lovely. They made sure that we were always well taken care of. n nIt does tend to get super crowded so I suggest early arrival. Definately go there swim suit ready or you may have to strip down to your bra and panties. You definately do not want to feel over dressed when everyone around you is in a sexy little two piece. n nMake sure you go with an appetite for not only alcohol but for food. It was great. We ordered the Chicken Skewers, fries and some Sushi rolls. We also had Chilled grey goose shots and a delicious variety of alcohol flavored Popsicles!",2
"I'm a fan, but only moderately. I can't really say that I see this is ""my HT "" just yet. It works and has everything, per usual. The layout is a bit odd, and I do feel a bit congested near the entrance exit. Still enjoy the produce section of HT and find this one to be on par with others around town. n nBig plus for having a bike rack outside. Living less than a mile away, I'm prone to get around more on my bike. Working out at the Dowd and then utilizing the bike lanes on East to get home makes this an easy destination for small necessities or singular items for dinner s . n nI can see this location becoming our regular spot in due time.",2
"I wanted to see this the last time I was in Vegas but didn't get the chance so upon my most recent trip I was very glad to catch it. n nIt is for 18 and there is lots of nudity and teasing. I thought it was very well put together although I wished there were a little more acrobatics. The actors were amazing, my favorites were the two girls in the big tub. There is a little comedy thrown in too to keep it lighthearted. n nTickets can be but my friends and I got a deal from the Danny at the Bellagio ticket counter who generously gave us the Bellagio discount even though we weren't staying there. We got 1st row balcony for just under 65 each and could see everything from where we were.",2
"Awesome spot to pregame before you hit the strip in Vegas! The bartender at the Wynn recommended this place to me and my friends our last night in Vegas and we weren't disappointed! n nGood music, great bottle service deal, staff were awesome! It's a good spot for people looking for something more intimate than the huge club feel you might get at Vegas clubs like Tao or XS. n nOnly real negative is the crowd was a little old, mostly 35 to as old as 50 something's which is not that bad, but it's just a little weird seeing people your parent's age giving you high fives, taking shots, and getting down to Pitbull and the Black Eyed Peas!",2
"A vacationing wife, nothing to eat in the house, and a penchant for women in yoga pants deliver me from evil, Amen. n n ""You really should try to eat healthy next week, "" my wife spouts while packing for her trip ""Try Whole Foods on your way home from work. "" n nWhat a mistake! nI went in hungry and left horny. Jesus. n nI highly recommend this place for any guy whose wife is out of town, is tired of cold pizza and beer for dinner, and, has an unhealthy affliction for women in sheer yoga pants. n nI now know what the Lululemon lawsuit is all about. nWhoever filed the lawsuit is obviously not a straight male with a vacationing spouse.",2
"Tried this place out for the first time and was very impressed. The food was EXCELLENT! We had a large party, so we were able to try out a decent chunk of the menu. Where this place really stands out is their steak the ribeye was amazing! and cheesecake. This is quite possibly the best cheesecake in Vegas. The calamari was really good as well, the sauce is what does it. n nAtmosphere is fairly plain, bar type. For the price of the food, I was expecting a more comfortable, upscale bistro. n nAll in all Food was delicious. Atmosphere was unimpressive. Price was higher than expected. Most entrees were in the 30 range.",2
"I can't get over how nice the staff is here! Also one time sassy cow was partnering with them to give out free sundaes, so that was a happy day. n nI've only tried a few things but everything has been very good. Definitely recommend getting the chocolate mousse to split with a friend. It's AWESOME, but too decadent to have by yourself others may disagree . Ask for a sample of the Parisian hot chocolate before you order something else, also very decadent but lovely for a taste! They also have a nice selection of sandwiches and other cafe items. n nI went on a Friday and they had live music playing which made the whole thing even lovelier!",2
"Simply the best non tart frozen yogurt in the world! Okay, that might be a little hyperbolic, but it's certainly the best I've ever had. Golden Spoon trumps TCBY, Miss Karen's, and all other fro yo competitors perfectly light and creamy at the same time, with the most delicious flavors, and the best variety anywhere! Mounds Bar, Cookies 'n' Cream, Heath Bar, Peanut Butter Cup, Espresso, Winter Mint, Cake Batter.the flavors are just fantastic! I like that they have many sizes, although I inevitably end up taking home 3 or so larges for the week. I guess what I'm trying to say is.I'm addicted to Golden Spoon! Ah, it feels so much better getting that out there in the open.",2
"I really liked this place. I dined alone here on October 9th for lunch. I was seated in the ""bar "" which was more of a prep area. The waiter came and brought me my iced tea quickly. He recommended the spaghetti and meatballs to me, which I ordered. Even though the restaurant was not busy, it did take quite a while for the food to arrive, however it was probably the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had. The sauce was on the spicy side, which I like and the meatballs were pretty much bite size. n nI did not order desert and since this was lunch, I cannot speak to the wine menu but would recommend it for lunch if you have the time.",2
"Seriously priced so well for excellent service and unlimited wine! A perfect place for group of gfs to get together, chill out with a glass of wine and getting a pedi. I myself have been a few times before but when I took my gfs and lil sis.all who live in the North east, they were in awe at the fact that it was a 25 for a full spa pedi, included 2 glasses of wine thats all we could manage hehe and wonderful folks who did a great job on all our nails. I am a clean freak and am often concerned about the tools that nail salons use but they are extremely clean at Polished. Love it! will def be going back.",2
"I LOVE this spa. I had such an amazing experience with I.V. Therapy and the Obagi Facial. It was my first time for I.V. Therapy and I could definitely tell a difference in my body once I had vitamins and nutrients received. I felt so energized and refreshed even a few days after treatment. Also, my facial was by Jolene and it was simply delicious! She had magical hands! I fell asleep during my facial and woke up with beautiful glowing skin. The products used didn't make me breakout which I have a problem with and really made me look and feel like I was glowing. I highly recommend this beautiful spa to go get anything done!",2
"This is the best dental practice I've been to since I was old enough to pick a dentist on my own. I've been going there for 3 years or so. The hygienists do good work and I've never had a painful or unpleasant cleaning. Dr. Kalons is my usual dentist. She's done one major tooth clean out for me, on a tooth with old fillings that had gone bad, and a couple of small fillings. All the work I've had done there has held up OK and not caused problems. I go in the early morning, and they get me in and out efficiently. The office staff are pleasant. No one tries to hard sell you any additional services. The office itself is clean and well maintained.",2
"Best Pho I've found in Vegas so far! n nThe broth was superb, although their selection of Pho isn't as big as most other places. I usually get the Pho Dac Biet anywhere I go, I love the tendon and tripe but this place only had rare steak, brisket, and flank. They put a lot of meat in it too which was a in my book, but the noodles and broth are what made it for me. n nEspecially being in Vegas, this might save your life the morning after a long night. After leaving Pho Kim Long I felt like new, ready to take on whatever vegas had left to throw at me. I WILL be back to this place again, thats for sure.",2
"If you've read my reviews, you know that I think that The Olive Garden chain is singlehandedly dumbing down America's taste for Italian cuisine. Riazzi's deserves your support for keeping this corner of Tempe a place where the three fs of Italian flourish flavor, family and um, OK two fs. n nWhen the place was last decorated in 1971, it was perfect. So why change? Yeah, it's dark and oddly laid out but so was my first girlfriend. If Riazzi's isn't what you're looking for in an independently run family Italian place, get your ass to Little Cesear's and eat cheezy breadsticks until they start tasting good.",2
"NY has bagels and Montreal has bagels. They're different and I like 'em both. Like at H H in the USW in NY I order whatever just came out of the hot oven. And so, tried and true, I ordered the Sesame Bagel. Seemed like the sesame was the overall favorite and most popular so we ordered one to go it was warm to the touch, smelled wonderful and the toasted sesame crisp to the bite. Was so good I just ate it w o cream cheese. Also ordered the Everything Bagel just for a taste, however, it was was sitting for a while so wasn't the best texture was tough dry and was a tad stale. Great experience friendly staff and efficient.",2
"I love eating at Golden Harbor! The owners of this place used to own Mandarin Wok and Cravings. They have also owned restaurants in Taiwan as well, so I always come here when I need a taste of home. When I first walked in, I was overwhelmed by the extensive Chinese menu that is plastered on the wall. There are so many dishes to choose from. There is also an English menu as well. The entrees are pretty pricey, but you get a large portion. I recommend bringing friends to split the bill so you can try more dishes! n nThings to try n crispy tofu n sacha lamb n three cup chicken n hou fun n taiwanese pork soup forgot the actual name n nOverall, great authentic Taiwanese food! A must try!",2
"We ventured to Javier's restaurant craving good Mexican food. nAlthough some of the reviews had us feeling skeptical, we decided to try it anyway. nWe entered without reservations and were seated immediately. nMy girlfriends ate carnitas and shrimp tacos. I ordered the special Cabo Azul. The guacamole was a bit on the weaker side so we asked the waiter to spice it up a bit. He returned and it was so much more to our liking. The food was scrumptious. The main dishes were just Delicious! nWe were wowed by the flavored and the excellent service. In addition you won't be disappointed because the atmosphere is great! nDefinitely a must go!",2
"I live in Los Angeles, and everytime I go to Scottsdale, I have to make a couple of stops to Local Bistro! The food is amazing! The ambience is hip, sexy and fun, and you can't beat the price for the calibre of food that you get. I have had many of their appetizers and entrees. The drunk bread and beef carpaccio as appetizers are phenomenal! Their parpadella bolognese is to die for, their salmon is delicious, and the grilled shrimp is fantastic! Like my husband says, ""it's damn good food! "" The service is wonderful, their wine list and drinks are superb and we always feel welcome! I just wish they would open a Local Bistro here in LA!",2
"A great dinner sponsored by one of my vendors. 16 of us were placed in the seats by the sidewalk windows.witness to the freaks going up and down the street. The KISS guy and Superman were on full display. Only slightly more laughable than some of the tourists. The waitresses were hot and efficient. The tequila list was extensive, tasty and expensive. The chips were hot and fresh, the salsa and guacamole were top nothing, too. My chicken fajitas were delicious. I always give an extra star when the meal is free, right. Everything just tastes better when money is no object. A great view, decent service, decent meal and lots of eye candy.",2
"The Adobado ribs make me shit fire for three days, but I keep going back. Granted, the staff is a little pretentious, the margaritas are grossly overpriced, the wait sucks, the place is noisy, and there's only one spice level hot as holy shit , but it's a true cultural experience, which is more than I can say for the rest of Phoenix, homogeneous craphole that it has become. n nAlso, this is NOT Tex Mex, so quit saying that. Tex Mex is from Texas, and it usually refers to beef enchiladas covered in chili and Velveeta, not insanely spicy New Mexico cuisine, which is how you would describe Los Dos Molinos.",2
"Ate here with a half dozen people. We probably ordered 25 dishes, maybe 30. Nearly all were hits. I'll say, this is a large menu and there is a lot to try. So, we were adventurous and ordered out of our comfort zone on a lot of things. But, the baby eel omelet was just a miss. I don't recommend it and won't get it again. And, baby eels look.exactly like you think they do. I like how you order several dishes, they bring them as they are prepared, and you can then order again. I think we had 3 or maybe 4 rounds of ordering. n nThe sangria is very good, as many yelpers note. If you have enough of it, the bill can get away from you at this place. Those small prices add up friends. Be advised.",2
"what a neat little place. n nit certainly is small to get to the washrooms you have to walk through the parking lot and follow signs to the back of another building but it all adds to the character of this homey little cottage. n nthe menu is charming breakfast, salads, sandwiches, soup, sweet stuff all done with an emphasis on small batch, local, organic, sustainable ingredients. the green eggs ham is delightful! n ni really love good coffee and unfortunately the iced latte i had here could not compete with the other coffeehouses in central phoenix. oh and then there's the fact that they aren't open on sundays ",2
"Fantastic dairy vegetarian kosher restaurant. This restaurant is not kosher at the expense of quality.it's truly good fare that all can enjoy. The Israeli style breakfasts, baked pastries, and endless cups of fresh Lavazza coffee better than Illy or Starbucks is my kind of breakfast. For lunch, the portobello pesto panini is my favorite. Try the Alfredo or tilapia for dinner or a thin crust margarita pizza. Gabriel, the owner, is a delightful, hospitable man who welcomes each and every customer personally. He also delivered to our medical office several times for luncheons and did not charge is a delivery fee.",2
"Great Cuban sandwiches and Mojitos. The outdoor patio seating is fun, because you can make fun of all the weird little kids hanging around in front of the movie theaters with their pants hanging off, and their hoods on, even though its 118 degrees out.Not that I'm judging them. I have one of my own at home kid, not a hoodie . I have been there several times and usually get the mini Cuban sandwich, and Plaintain chips. They have a name, but I cant remember it unless I am looking at the menu. The menu is quite extensive, but if your drinking the mojitos, and I recommend it, you wont need much to eat. And the more you have, the weirder those kids get. ",2
"The food is great bar food hamburgers, wings, fish and chips etc and its not to pricey, possibly the best food prices you'll find in old town if you are looking to go out. The coolest part of this bar by far is the night time activities. The 2x4 jenga, the gold fish races, the midget bar the little women who runs it is actually a really hot little person , the wheel of drinks, the plunger all amazing. nI thought it would be funny to ICE a buddy of mine get an unsuspecting person a Smirnoff Ice, which they then have to kneel down and chug and the bar staff decided to ice me, the shenanigans are fantastic. Ill take this bar over the up you ass snotty clubs any day or night.",2
"I'd never been to Sweet Republic before, but we decided to host an event here north valley friday night on the last Friday night of June. The owners were very friendly and welcoming. The place is really cute and their ice cream is amazing! I had the date ice cream paired with roquefort blue cheese ice cream. It sounded crazy so I had to get it, and it was really really good! for the less adventurous, S R offers normal flavors too, my son had mint chocolate chip . The home made brittle makes for a yummy topping and next time I plan to try one of their ice cream sandwiches yummy ice cream in between two oversized cookies. n nHighly recommended!",2
"Delicious! Lynn W and I had a late lunch here after watching a Fall league baseball game at HoHoKam. I've been wanting to stop in forever, especially since it's so close to home. n nI had the Carne Asada plate fajitas, although nothing like any fajitas I've ever had and it was awesome. The meat was marinated and char grilled, so tender and so so tasty. I loved that the peppers and onions were also char grilled, no grease puddle like other places. The rice was flavorful and beans were some of the best I've ever had. n nI had the raspberry margarita and it was so very good. n nI'll definitely be back here again!",2
"I went here right after my birthday to treat myself. My boss recommended it. I only had a short wait, in the front lobby then they take you back to a lounge with coffee, water, cookies, very nice!. I was a bit nervous but I hated how my mouth turned down due to aging and gravity it looked like I was frowning all the time. Mary was super within 10 minutes my lips looked natural no more frowning. I had one small bruise after, but that is to be expected if you are taking aspirin alive or motrin. In fact I went out dancing the next night. I am going back to get my thin lips filled in for a more soft look. I am looking forward to it. I highly recommend Advanced Aesthetics.",2
"So, I rarely write reviews but I need to contribute to the good things said about Dekes. I called earlier this week because my AC had stopped working and Steve was at my house the next day. He looked at my AC unit for 2 seconds and knew what my problem was. I just moved into this house and the unit had been neglected and just needed a couple water strainers cleaned. He took 5 minutes to tell me how to go about doing it myself and then he left. Didn't charge me a dime and it took me no time to clean the strainers myself and now my AC is working great again. If I have any problems in the future Dekes will be my first call.",2
"Pep Boys off Scottsdale rd is the best one I've found throughout the Valley. They always have lots of people working so your car gets in and out of the garage fast. n nMy best advice is to sign up for the Pep Boys rewards program to get great discounts in the mail for your next service. I just had to get my starter replaced on my Acura and using my discounts I was able to get 100 off my service! n nHowever, even if you don't have a rewards program or may have forgot your mailed discounts at home, they have a great coupon list on their website for everyone! Whats even better is they can scan the coupon right off your smartphone!",2
"I've eaten at many Chinese places around the Champaign Urbana area and this is by far the best one I have tried. n nRainbow Garden is great for dining in or taking out. The service is excellent and the food is always fantastic. I've tried a few different things from the menu and have thoroughly enjoyed each of them. n nThe prices are about the same as any other Chinese restaurant in the area as are the portions unless you have a large appetite, one dish can usually provide two meals . My only complaint is that while dining in they do not provide enough rice with their meals. This isn't a problem, though, as they are happy to give you more upon request.",2
