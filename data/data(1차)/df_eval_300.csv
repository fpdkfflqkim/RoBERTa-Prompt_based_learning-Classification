"We hired them to move from the bay area to Las Vegas. After much research we decided to go with this local company because their price was the most reasonable, and they could do packing, moving, and unpacking. We called and gave them requested information such as square footage of the house and list of furniture we had. When we tried to tell them more details, such as number of rooms in the house, they didn't want the information. They said it would be no problem and gave us an estimate of 5 hours for moving and packing, which we were shocked, but they assured us that they have very experienced movers. When the guys arrived, however, they acted very surprised by how much they were supposed to pack and move. They later told me it's because houses are built differently in San Francisco vs. Las Vegas, they didn't expect so many rooms given the square footage. But we did gave them a list of furniture and number of boxes before their arrival! Anyway, they were able to hire two extra men on site and managed to finish the job. I have to say I was very worried watching them pack. They wrapped nothing, even glassware, and just throw it into the box loosely. Luckily the hired men from another company McCarthy Moving and Storage handled our baby grand piano and they did a superb job. When we arrived in Las Vegas, there were only a few damages the front wheel and basket was broken of a bike, and a beautiful arm chair was stained on the side. It was a great relief. The movers were hard working and courteous and tried to do the best job given the situation. n nI think overall if you pack everything yourself or move within Las Vegas, or have nothing super valuable like a grand piano, this company is fine. But with our experience I would most likely look for another company the next time we move.",1
"No dice! n nMy family and I visited Chuy's on a Tuesday afternoon. We recently moved to the Mesa area and wanted the opportunity to check out some of the local restaurants to see what was in the neighborhood. n nUpon entering the restaurant we couldn't help but notice how outdated the signs are on the wall, the decor looks beat up, and the place was dead. I think one other table besides us was in the restaurant. The waitress came up and told us we could sit where we wanted and to help ourselves to the free chips and salsa bar. That sounded yummerz! No dice again. The chips were stale and the salsa was pretty so so, but you couldn't even eat it with the chips being so awful. Next came the service, or lack thereof. We waited forever for our drinks, and I want to reiterate that there were only 2 tables in the restaurant ours and another. Finally the drinks came and she brought a pitcher of water to the table. That was a quality move, and the reason why they got 1 star compared to 0 stars I know you can't give 0 stars . n nThe food was a disaster and everything looked like a punch in the stomach. I felt like if I ordered anything from this overly deep fried menu that I would be looking at a few hours on the pot or bent over clutching my stomach in the fetal position from the stomach ache it would give me. Finally I decided to make the plunge and just go for it a rancho style wet chicken burrito. I figured I needed to give this place a reasonable chance to come out of left field and totally impress me. Guess what? No dice! n nThe burrito looked like grocery store Jose Ole brand, and like it was taken out of the microwave too soon. I had a few bites and submitted to the painstakingly bad burrito. My Mom ended up sending her food back, and my Dad, well, he'll eat anything. n nOverall this place is NOT the spot for food. I hear they have great drink prices and that it is a fun place to kick it and what not, but they should close their kitchen.",1
"I recently moved to the area and finally had to take up the terrifying task of finding a new stylist. Enter Yelp I checked out a few of the top rated places and decided to make my appointment for a drastic cut and color at the Orange Olive Hair Gallery. n nMy appointment was with Jessica. She was fantastic one of the most talented stylists I've encountered. She's confident and creative. My cut and color are amazing, and I look forward to many more appointments at the Orange Olive soon!",2
"low carb dieting is awesome. n naaaaaand it sucks. n nhere's the deal i love meat and dairy items, but i also love bread, so being deprived of it is the pits. when i heard mamma mia's had a low carb pizza uh, 10 carbs for the whole thing? what? i just about flipped my lid. i still feel like they're somehow lying because i don't understand how that's even possible, but whatever, i'm not pushing it. n ni first found out about this pizza two or so months ago, but like an idiot, totally forgot and never got around to ordering it. fast forward to tonight when i was feeling cranky, tired, and in need of a pizza fix. bam! mamma mia's low carb pizza is a thing i can have for dinner! and i can have it delivered to my lazy ass! n ni chose to get it with garlic, fresh basil, pepperoni, and black olives and boy did it not disappoint! the crust isn't your typical pizza crust, but more of a tortilla like situation. i would say it's more comparable to a thin crust pizza except not as crispy. no, it doesn't have all that doughy breadness you're used to, but for a low carb pizza, it's pretty freakin' awesome. since the crust is so thin, it doesn't hold up super well when you try to handle a slice, but i was able to fold it in half and still enjoy it. n nif you're low carbin' it up and missing pizza, check out mamma mia's! i wish more people had awesome options like them!",2
"Swanky tapas, Vegas style! Who doesn't like the sound of that? n nI certainly don't, so that's why I made a beeline to Julian Serrano for my first night's dinner on the Strip. n nFirst of all, Chef Julian Serrano's eponymous restaurant is absolutely beautiful. It overflows with bold, colorful tile that's a feast for the eyes. It's also very loud in there, since it's directly adjacent to the Aria resort lobby, a mere feet from hordes of tired hotel guests checking in and out. And, no, there are no walls to keep out the hubbub. n nAfter taking a seat at the long, comfortably, and classy bar, I was quickly helped by one of the friendly and efficiently bartenders. After ordering a glass of Sauvignon blanc to whet the palate, I browsed the mouthwatering and long menu of tapas options. The menu is nicely organized into fish ceviche, veggie, and meat poultry tapas, making it easy to navigate. There's also a catch all ""new style "" tapas category, as well as paellas and ""platos grandes "" for those of you with larger appetites. n nFour items were just enough to fill the belly without making me uncomfortably full. Here's the rundown of what I tried n n1. White ceviche. Everyone knows I love a good ceviche, and this one was a knockout. The white fish was tender and flaky, with just the right amount of heat and tang from the lime and cilantro. n n2. Brava potatoes. This dish was a little less exciting than I thought it would be it's essentially just fries with aioli. That said, the flavors were excellent. There's a lot of aioli provided, so I ended up taking the excess off to prevent the potatoes from getting soft. I did enjoy eating the potatoes with the little skewers provided. n n3. Tuna cones. This dish was the weirdest and also my least favorite. It consisted of 3 wantons rolled into ice cream cones , which were filled with avocado, and then ahi tartare and aioli on top. Again, my issue was the overabundance of aioli, which overwhelmed everything else. I couldn't taste the tuna at all. n n4. Santiago's cake. This was an almond cake dusted with powdered sugar, with a side of almond ice cream. Simple but very well done. My only gripe was that the cake was a little dry, but this was remedied by letting the ice cream melt all over it. n nAll in all, Julian Serrano was a great dinner, although the little hiccups along the way make me hesitant about rushing back. After all, you're paying Vegas Strip prices here most tapas are in the 10 15 range, but some are more , so you tend to expect perfection for your buck. n nThat said, with all the amazing options on Julian Serrano's menu, it'd be hard to resist the temptation to try them all.

"I'm giving Chipotle a 2 only to differentiate them from Qdoba, which is definitely worse, but in a just world this would be a 1.5. The food is only nominally Mexican, meat is dry and not so flavorful, prices not all that reasonable, and the salsa tasteless. There's really no reason to go to either Qdoba or Chipotle with La Bamba and even better Los Amigos around.",1
"Absolutely THE BEST iced coffee. The coffee is fantastic and the ice they use it's like pebbles of ice and it takes a long time to melt, so your drink is super cold really makes this the best cup of iced coffee in the area. The blended drinks are so much better than any those sugar coma frappuccinos that Starbucks serves. n nFree Wifi, great outdoor seating area, and friendly staff. As good as it gets.",2
"We had our wedding reception in a beautiful private room overlooking the patio. The room holds about 60 sit down, and I think up to 80 stand up. We put down an 800 dollar deposit, with a minimum of 4,000 , add on tax and tip and round up to about 5,100. They also have a smaller room that holds about 35 people for 3000 minimum. n nThe banquet coordinator Jessica was unbelievably sweet and helpful. She went above and beyond the call of duty. She helped me with everything. I emailed her about a million times and talked with her at length about everything. Cake, food, rental, seating arrangements, flowers, and even suggestions of other vendors. She helped me find rental chairs and she booked it under her business name and got me a cheaper rate. The Border Grill chairs are an orange brownish color. I really wanted silver chairs. The rental chairs ran about 10 dollars each, and Jessica got me her cheaper rate at about 8 each. She also got me a speaker and microphone for about 50 dollars cheaper. You don't really need a speaker if your best man is loud enough. Go through Jessica, she makes sure the rental's show up on time.I think she knows about getting a DJ as well. I don't think a DJ is worth it. The Border Grill music is pipped in, the stereo system is awesome. It is kind of Jazzy, Latin music. They can also turn it off really quick when you have speeches. n nI had already booked my wedding cake with another vendor for about 500 . They add a cake cutting fee, I think 2 per person. n FYI.she is working with the chef on wedding cakes. I think she said they would run about 170 for 30 people, but don't quote me on that. She had no pictures, so I went with my first option. Talk to her about cakes, see if they updated the website with pictures. n nThey have no hidden charges. She sits with you on the phone tapping away at her calculator. So you know exactly what things will cost. nShe helped me with my choice of entrees and changes that I wanted with adding on different types of sauces and salads. Their ""Set Menu "" are very flexible, and the prices are very reasonable.for Vegas. I got about 8 appetizer platters to pass around for cocktail half hour they run anywhere from 13 to 50 . I had two salad choices, a champagne toast and for the entrees I had fish, skirt steak, and enchilada's. About 65 per person. Everyone raved about the food. I printed my own menu's, see pictures above. I wish that I had printed a drink menu of margarita's and sangria suggestions on the back of my menu's. I don't think people took full advantage of the full bar and they mostly got wine and beer. n nSo my total cost for 55 people with the ultra lavish food, tons of appetizers, champagne toast, full open bar and amazing rental chairs ran about 9000 dollars. You can easily go thousands less depending on your guest count, food and rental needs. I also asked Jessica to charge my card for about 1000 a month for four months so that I did not have a crazy bill on my wedding day. Don't worry, she really only needs the deposit to hold the room. Layaway wedding.less stress. nAlso if you want to send favors, menu's and candles. Ship them to her office. She told me to send them to her, and I made the mistake of shipping all my boxes to The hotel room. Then they charged me 30 to deliver to my room and then the hotel lost one of my boxes. Jessica walked over to the postal delivery room and talked with security and had him look through all of the boxes for me. WOW, talk about above and beyond. Thank You. The lost box had my cake server set, thank God Jessica had a nice set to lend me. nThey do provide beautiful candles in an orange striped color glass, so if your colors match that then your set for the tables. nWe had a beautiful wedding reception. It was magical. Worth every penny.",2
"As you read the other reviews on his place, I'm sure you noticed the 4 and 5 stars. Let me tell you that they are WELL EARNED. When in Charlotte, you MUST try this place. It is so unique. Who ever heard of burgers and Sushi? n nI've had a lot of cheap Chinese food in my life and thus a lot of crab Rangoon. Their unique take on this Chinese restaurant standard is nothing less of incredible. n nThe portions are huge. I'm a big guy and I usually finish my plate. Not here. LOL! The staff is extremely friendly and the atmosphere is cool. n nIf you can't tell, I was blown away by this place. I wish we had one in Atlanta. Right now, it's only in Charlotte, NC. n nOk, I've said enough. I won't write a book about it but if you are thinking about trying this place, DO THAT!",2
I have to agree with all the other Yelp reviews.tried the Bobbie and love it! I'm from Dallas and wish there was one closer to home.,2
"Unfortunately my love for DD has been on a steady decline in the last year. Every once in awhile I'll try to reel it back in, only to end up disappointed once again. I order the same iced coffee every time, and every time it is bad. Always thin, watered down, no flavor whatsoever. At least they have consistency going for them.",1
"This restaurant has a cool atmosphere with nice outdoor seating. Glasses of wine were okay which is too bad since all the glasses are 9 but the ""pitchas "" of beer are a pretty good deal. The food was alright, but the service left A LOT to be desired. Servers were slow and inattentive, and we had to consistently beg for water refills, which is a problem when you're sitting outside in 100 degree weather. I recommend skipping dinner at this place and just heading next door for ice cream instead!",1
"I have thought about writing this review for a while and have finally decided to get out. I have been with this practice for over three years now and the service has consistently declined. Within the past year the time it takes to even make appointments has increased to 15min of waiting on hold just to then have them tell you that they don't have any appointment times open that will suit your schedule for at least two weeks. I have not seen the same physician each time I have visited in the past year and only one time have I received courteous service. If you want to be able to see the doctor in a timely manner and have the staff at least seem like they care about you consistently, then South Point Family Practice is not the place for you.",1
"I have been a customer of University Animal Hospital for over 7 years and my dogs stay is the straw that broke the camels back on why he will not go back. Jared in the back was awesome, the only reason for 2 stars, but the reception area was a disaster. I called to make the appointment and was on hold ten minutes, I am use to it, but went thru and gave them all the information on my dog, who has been going there 7 years, and reservation set. The day comes for me to drop him off and my mom's dog and I am waiting for 5 minutes, than I finally get helped and I repeat everything that I told the receptionist when I made the appointment, its like I never mad an appointment. Finally after dealing with the receptionist and needing to get one dogs papers out of my care I asked can someone come take the dogs so I can finish the paperwork, finally Jared was brought out. I continued to argue on if my dog needed the flea and tic treatment, I thought that was in his heartworm mesication, she confirmed or gave up and I was out of there. I get a call the next day and put on hold 10 minutes again as I am traveling, I am ticked by now, go to find out they are asking about my dogs flea and tic treatment again, I was like I don't have time for this. I go thru the whole speech again on flea and tick, go to find out the medicine does not have both, not happy with his vet now. They are going hill quickly. We didnt get a repotcard like we use to but Jared helped me get the dogs to the car.",1
"This review is based on 3 separate visits, all dine in. n nFood I ordered the Carolina, Classic, and Chicago burgers, one for each visit. The burger itself is a bit too greasy, and over salted.The burger patty is oversized in diameter for the bun, making the burger extremely sloppy and messy to eat. The taste was average, with the Carolina burger being the most interesting and flavorful. The fries were interesting and moderately tasty, but not extraordinary. n nPrice The price was somewhat higher than the direct competition, and overpriced for the quality of the food. n nCleanliness The restaurant was relatively clean, although finding a clean table was a challenge on all three visits. The place is brightly colored and lit,with a slight retro 50's psuedo west coast vibe. n nService Service is, for want of a better word, terrible. The level of apathy displayed by the employees including the managers approaches the level of t.v. sitcom cliche. It's so pervasive they should just incorporate it into the smashburger theme. The service was bad on all 3 visits. n nOverall I was excited to have another burger joint in Ballantyne, but overall Smashburger is a disappointment. The price is too high for average food with poor service. There are 2 Five Guys in the area, I would definitely recommend them over Smashburger they have a better product, cleaner restaurant, lower prices, and employee who at least pretend to care.",1
"I like Humble Pie. A lot. I would rank it above Cibo, but below Bianco because Chris Bianco is magic. n nHere's what's great about Humble Pie nI've usually been for lunch on a Sunday, but have also been for dinner and have never had to wait. nThe pizza is perfect! Lots of gourmet pies to choose from I've tried the prosciutto, pear and Gorgonzola, the potato and roasted garlic with fontina and Gorgonzola add prosciutto and, most recently, artichoke hearts, caramelized onions and olives I think this was my fave so far . nTo quote the Great Muppet Caper. ""I HATE peperoni "" but my dining partners don't. at Humble Pie, I can get my fancy schmancy pizza and they can get pepperoni. nThe fries ROCK! nThe veggie salad is so refreshing with just the right amount of herb vinaigrette dressing. nThey're just crazy enough to offer olive oil gelato and I'm just crazy enough to try it! nMondays are half off bottles of wine. n nHere's what's not great about Humble Pie. I live too far for delivery. But, really that's probably a GOOD thing. ",2
"My husband and I saw that this place had a salad bar, so we decided to try it out. nOnce we we seated our waiter came and took our drink order, and brought them to us. We sat there for about 5 mins while he was cleaning two other tables, the place was not busy and we had our menus closed just waiting for him to take our order. Very annoying. Finally I asked the hostess as she walked by who our waiter was we were ready to order. It was the same guy who took our drink order and taking his time cleaning tables instead of taking care of his customers. He took our orders and I asked for the check and boxes right away as I could tell he would be slow. He told us we could not get boxes cause we got the salad bar, I clarified that we were not using the boxes for the salad, he said those were the rules. Our food came quickly and it was all good, though he never asked. When we were finishing eating he asked if we could please hurry and sign so he could go home. We will never go back. Unfourtunatley the service is always awful in the sun city area.",1
"We decided to have something different last night and tried the Tropical Smoothie Cafe in Village Square at Peccole Ranch. We got a pamphlet in our door a week or so ago, and the menu looked interesting. n nI had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken wrap and my wife had the King Caesar wrap. I had a Hawaiian Breeze Smoothie with my meal. n nThe wraps were very tasty and the price was good. They have a special of two wraps for 9.99. n nThis made a quick take out stop for an early dinner I had to have before meeting s friend near the Strip. I'll return. There are other things on the menu that need trying and this is a good alternative for fast food.",2
"Thank you Yelp for my first opportunity to enjoy Gammage. n nImpressive architecture and design it is also mostly functional ! nThe seats are roomier than expected and the rows have just enough room between them to allow people to pass relatively easily in front of you without having to stand up to let them through. Relative to US Airways Center seats which outside of Lexus Club and courtside seats are several inches narrower than the ones at Gammage and you have to stand up every time someone needs to pass. nHaving the room to pass easily is nice, especially if you are seated in the middle of the auditorium, since you have to pass in front of at least 30 people just to get to your seat if your, say, running late or need to escape to the restroom. nThis is also a negative especially if you are the crowd fearing or clostrophobic type, there are not good ""outs "" from the center. n nI think it is wonderful to have a location that hosts wonderful Broadway performances and a variety of other artistic entertainment performances.",2
"The new proprietors of the kitchen have successfully created the most delicious burger I've ever tasted. The burgers consist of different hand ground cuts of free range, hormone free beef. The French fries are double blanched and double fried that guarantees a crisp, yummy fry. The onion rings are cut to order, the tempura batter light and the homemade dipping sauce is perfect. Stop in ask for James he's one of the new owners of kitchen and the head chef .",2
The service was great and the food was excellent. If you don't want to wait for a table the counter's are open which was nice. The decor is great!,2
"The main disappointment that I have with this place is that they seem to have the same yogurts flavors all the time. I would love to see apple pie froyo or green apple, nor toasty marshmellow. Something to make this place stand out from the other places. n nAs for being clean. I have never seen this place unorganized. It has always been clean and everything has always been filled. n nJust once, I saw an employee talking to her friend who came in. This parton brought in his dog. The dog jump up against the counter for a second before the owner of the dog yanked or pulled it back down. n nThe dog that was in by the food was NOT a service dog whatsoever. nI am fully aware that service dogs are allowed in food and other establishment. n nAfter he left, I nicely told the girl behind the counter that the dog should not have been in here. She saw the dog jump up too. She told me she could not stop him. I told her that she should not have allowed in him with the dog. The young teen told me that it is okay the dog is friendly. She seemed to be unaware of the no dogs in establishements rule. Of course again, service pets are permited n nNORMALLY the place is very well run. Kudos to Wai for a great place. nIf they had more of a varitey of exotic flavors, I would have given this place nFIVE PLUS stars.",2
"I worked there when I was high school they, however they are nice selection but you can.",1
"I heard a lot about this place, and I tried it last month, and what people say about it is true, it is the best sushi all you can eat in the city. And I have been going more often recently as a susholic. nOnly one negative remark is that they are changing there menu a lot, and it is getting harder and harder to get the sashimi as a weekday dinner or lunch choice. n nBut all in all i recommend it, and dont forget to bring your own wine.white wine works best.",2
"I haven't been here in quite some time, so this review might be a bit dated. n nEven so, though, I highly doubt they caught up with Sapphires or the Rhino in the past couple months. n nIt was a nice change from the norm, but I doubt I'd come back. The girls just were not that cute, a couple of them that approached the table I was at were stumbling drunk, and it just wasn't the best time ever. I'll stick with my old standards. you can never really go wrong at Sapphires!",1
"I have been here several times with friends and family. This is one great place for beer, food and a fun time! They have a wide selection of beers and they even have the table where you can pour your own beer! How fun is that! I tried several of their dark beers last time I was there and I certainly will return for their Gluten free beer, what an intrresting concept. nFor food, I enjoy fried pickles lots! The tsweetness and sourness match perfectly with the cripsy outside. Another appetizer is the duck buns. The bun seems a bit too much but the duck is juicy and delicious. Main course I like the beef brisket and prime ribs in their bbq section. . Lamb chop is a great choice too but unfortunately they do not have mint jelly. My all time favourite is the shepherd's pie which is a must order !",2
"Was Here Memorial Day Weekend. What a Mess. Staff needs to go. If you don't want to work at subway, then don't work at subway. Everything was done with an attitude. Everything being thrown around or harshly. Worst subway I have ever been to.",1
"Not as challenging but boy you don't have to go far to get away from it all. I went up to the Taliesian lookout, which has a good view of the valley, and back and around the lost dog trail and I saw 8 people the entire time. Great markers, signs and facility at the trailhead with water, map and bathrooms. Not super challenging but you are sure to see wildlife, I saw a snake, chipmunk and hawks. If you want some zen time to yourself, and not kill yourself hiking up a huge mountain definitely hit this trail.",2
My coworker and I decided to do lunch here after dropping off coworkers at the airport. We decided to spend the rest of the day walking around Madison. We got ate around 1 which seemed to be a perfect time the lunch rush was over! Our waiter was excellent and very helpful as far as the menu was concerned. My friend had the blue moon beef which is only available in Wisc she loved it and wanted to take a case home. We both ordered the Korean BBQ sandwich. Heaven in my mouth! It was the perfect balance between spicy and sweet. Our waiter enticed is with the bourbon pecan pie again a hit! Very rich and sweet so it's good we ended up sharing 1 portion! Now that we've had a taste of Graze. We want more! Next Epic trip will include dinner at Graze. Btw all their food is locally sourced and tastes like it too!,2
"i went here in 2006 and it was great.went back 2011 and it sucked! the yakisoba was yaki. and it was under the all you can eat menu and they said i had to pay extra if i didn't finish it and i said I'm not gonna pay for food that is gross. then the waiter got rude and then it too 20 mins for the next order to come to the table, and we were forced to pay this rude dude a gratuity tip.",1
"This was my first time here especially to Vegas. My boyfriend and I decided to change up our meals and have some Thai food for our trip. Because we were staying at Stratosphere for our last day, we stopped by here for lunch. The ratings were a bit high so we also thought we'd give it a shot. n nFAIL! I would have to repeat on some viewers that if you haven't had good thai food if you think this place is good. The vibe coming in here wasn't very pleasant. The Pad Thai that I got was gross to me. Good thing was during lunch hour my meal turned into a lunch special which came with an egg roll and the price reduced a little. And the egg roll was gross too. n nSuppose they are going to relocate to soon just in case there are people who are in love with this place. Just a heads up in this case. Overall, I would never come back.",1
Food great.Very quick. Attractive. Very clean. I had 5 combo and Pastor Taco. Truly enjoyable.,2
My hubby and I came here for lunch yesterday afternoon. We had been wanting to try the place out for awhile. When it came up on Groupon we thought it was perfect time to give it a try. n nI was pleasantly surprised by their menu. Most wine bars have a limited menu when it comes to food. I ordered their egg sandwich sounds weird but it was sooo good! and my husband had the chicken pesto pasta. Both were so amazing! Waitress was super sweet and very attentive. n nI like the atmosphere. Comfy and cozy. and they have great wine specials. I will def have to bring my girlfriends here for a glass or two in the future!,2
"I have dealt with Clyde the owner and his staff for 30 years. You can not stay in business that long if service and product availability is lacking. It is just the opposite. Pricing has ALWAYS been good. Service has ALWAYS been solid and consistent over all these decades. Of course, clientele has changed, and changed dramatically in the last several years. Impulse buyers are coming out in droves. An undereducated and sensitive lot they are. Expectations all over the board. The Pistol Parlour has weathered these fluctuations in the market far better than ANY shop in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Simply put, buy with confidence.",2
"Went to Montreal for the weekend and when I checked into my hotel, they said my pup was allowed there but not in the room by himself! Of course I had to hurry to find a place to leave him the next day so I could explore the city and I came upon DoggyDay. Eve was very nice on the phone and met me at a park the next morning for my pup to meet the ones he would be spending the day with. She took him and other pups up to the woods to play in the snow for a while and posted pictures on Facebook for me to be able to see which I loved. When I went to pick him up it was obvious by his mannerisms that he loved her and had a great time. If I'm back in Montreal with him I will definitely use their services again and highly recommend them!",2
"It is basically ritual that I visit empanada man during the Saturday farmer's market. All my friends know this. This is what gets me out of bed on Saturday mornings. n nTheir empandas are amazing. And if they weren't amazing enough their sauces bump it up to a whole other level. n nMmmm.that sauce. And I read on another review that you can apparently buy it in bulk! I could drink that sauce. probably not a good idea though n nMy favorites are the shredded beef and cheese. And the guava and cream cheese, beware that guava can be hot! I would wait for this particular empanada to cool down a bit before taking a bite. n nYou can't go wrong with any of the choices though. The owner is super nice and very interesting to talk to, has a cool story of where he is from and how the cart came to be. One time the wind blew the churro I just ordered out of my hand and he gave me a new one free of charge. n nEveryone should go eat these empanadas! You won't regret it.",2
"I visited Gemini for the first time today and it cheered me up after a long day of stress, stress, stress at work. I love playing ITG and DDR and even though I'm still pretty much a newb at it no one made fun of me while I was there. The place is super clean and the equipment isn't thrashed like most I've seen. They have paper towels, baby powder, and fans to keep you cool at the dance machines which is incredibly awesome for those crazy river dancin' peeps. n nThe UFO Catcher crane game is addicting and is filled with plushies that I really really wants. Especially the taiko no tatsujin ones.so damn cute. I'm not good at those games so I paid my best friend to try to win me one. No luck this time, but we will be back. n nThey had other things I wanted to try also, but being new to the place and only having 20 left on hand kind of prevented me from having my fill of all the machines that were there. n nThe benches, couch, and disco ball are pretty rad too.",2

The super shuttle had to pick me up at the airport and bring me to a hotel. The shuttle was prepaid and reserved a week in advance. n nUpon arrival they told that they had no shuttle available the next hour. What is the point of pre reservation if it is not honored? n nFor my return trip to the airport they never showed up. For an airport shuttle to be more than 30 minutes late it is completely useless. n nThe service delivered is unacceptable. I have never seen such poor airport shuttle service before.,1

Now the second time we went I was in my 2nd almost 3rd trimester the experience was not so good we were running bout ten minutes late which was our fault completly, they were so rude on the phone and acted like they were slammed! We pulled up to them sitting on the no one else was in there! walked in and the ultrasound tech rolled her eyes was beyond rude rushed us in and rushed us out didn't even make conversation was completly cold. I recommeded this place the first time around but would never recommend again! Guess it depends on who you get?",1
"I visit this Moe's in Dilworth occasionally for lunch on Saturdays. I think the burritos taste a bit better at Qdoba and Chipotle, but Moe's offers something the others don't free chips and a salsa bar with a variety of yummy salsas including my fave, the sweet green tomatillo salsa I could literally eat buckets of it . n nI hate the whole ""Welcome to Moe's! "" thing when I go into a Moe's. It's very insincere sounding and just sounds so unenthusiastic routine. Nobody even looks up to smile and greet you. They just listen for someone to come in the door and shout. I'd have nightmares about it if I worked there. n nAnyway, the service there always seems a bit off whenever I go. It takes awhile for someone to greet you because they're busy doing whatever side work they're doing and or talking amongst themselves. n nThis last time around, I tried the vegetarian burrito. It comes with ""free "" guacamole whereas you have to pay to get it on the meat filled burritos. It seems kind of silly to ask me what I want on my burrito, but they do. I want everything that's listed on the menu, that's what I want. Maybe they're hoping I don't ask for the more expensive guac even though it says it comes with it? n nThe male manager who works there and operates the cash register is usually quite rude, abrupt, and doesn't care whether you're there or not. And, most times, he's watching a sports game on one of the TVs in the dining room instead of doing his job. He's your stereotypical store restaurant manager. This time, he took time out from frying up nacho chips a daunting task, I'm sure to briefly ring me up and sliding my food to me across the counter, before returning to his other task. Well, thank you, and you have a nice day, too. For that, you want me to fill up your tip jar prominently located at the register? Methinks not. n nThe burrito seemed a bit small without the meat. Qdoba and Chipotle seem to give you more rice and beans. Maybe this would be a good idea for Moe's, too, especially on vegetarian burritos? It tasted pretty good, though, but the guac could have been a bit fresher and brighter green. And, naturally, the chips and unlimited tomatillo salsa were fantastic. They even have a new salsa a mixture of a tomato salsa and tomatillo. It was good, too, but I still preferred the green tomatillo. n nI give the burrito a solid B, the chips and salsa bar an A , and the service a C. Hence, my four stars.",2
"I really dont understand how people like this place. I didnt like it the first time i went, but my friends really wanted to check this place out, so i went again. and ARGH i just dont get it! n nMusic house nCrowd short uglies nDrink super pricey n nThe only good thing was that we got in for free. but other than that, yuck yuck yuckity yuck",1
"I purchased a lot of supplies to make crafty things for my wedding this summer. Afterwards, I had a number of items left over that I hadn't used, so my mother helped me out by returning some of the items for me. One of the receipts fell between her car seats, so a few of the items were not returned with original receipt. n nThis store has a policy of returning the lowest value at which the item has ever been priced, if you don't have a receipt. One of the items had been clearanced out, so she received less than half the price we paid back on a merchandise card. n nThis particular item had been purchased less than a week prior, so this really irritated me. When we discovered the receipt between the car seat, I went back to Joann's and asked them to return the full amount of money. While I didn't think I was going to get it back on my credit card, I was hoping that I could at least get the full credit. n nHere's where things dissolved. I entered the store and went to the nearest cashier. She looked at me blankly when I told her what I wanted to do, and referred me to an older lady named Jean. Jean was very nice and said that she could help me out. She proceeded to try to get the appropriate amount back to me by re returning the item at the normal price, then having me pay back the clearance amount. However, she screwed up and did not actually refund the normal price back to me she said she was putting it on my gift card . When I tried to explain that she was actually having me leave the store with LESS money than when I came in, she got upset and tried to tell me that I didn't understand the process that she was using. I understood perfectly, and kept trying to explain to her how the balance on the gift card was LESS not more. Finally, she got extremely frustrated with me I was very polite, and kept thanking her for helping me out, and was never rude during the entire process and went to talk to the manager. The manager had her refund the clearance price back to me which was put on a separate gift card . So, I ended up leaving the store with the EXACT same amount of money as when I went in. n nThis poor cashier just couldn't understand what I was saying, and wouldn't listen to me. So my whole visit to the store was pointless in fact, now I have the same amount of money on two separate gift cards instead of one. I'm sure at the end of the night, this cashier's register didn't total up, since the money was never refunded to me. n nOh well. Caveat emptor. And now I'm stuck with these stupid gift cards. Yeah, first world problems, I realize. ",1
"My daughter and I love Liz! She does a wonderful facial and wonderful massage during the facial. A few days after the facial, my skin always looks awesome. My daughter will only get her eye brows done by Liz!",2
"T and I followed the great Yelp reviews to Meat and Potatoes for a Saturday morning brunch. Wow. First of all, I want to move in to this place. If I could choose a restaurant's decor, this would be it. Sexy velvet, white ceramic animals, metal curio cabinets, and a gorgeous white fireplace. Yes please! We made a reservation but wound up getting there about 15 minutes late. We called to tell them we'd be late. We expected a bit of a wait but were happy to be seated immediately upon arrival. n nWhile perusing the menu, the waitress brought over big mugs of coffee and described the specials which included a Pastry of the Day. Tip to all brunch restaurants, have a Pastry of the Day. This particular day it was described as a criossant monkey bread with a Krispy Kreme glaze twist. Needless to say, we ordered it. I could have had this and a cup of coffee and walked away satisfied. It was fresh, soft, crispy, sweet. Exactly as described as a Krispy Kreme monkey bread. Holy cow. They should put this on the menu permanently. n nT got the huevos ranchero and I got the French toast. The huevos ranchero were great, cheesy and spicy. I found the black beans a touch bland but that was my only complaint. My French toast was amazing and came with bacon almond brittle. Yum! My only complaint was my own doing. I had sweet upon sweet and I should have ordered a savory breakfast since we got the pastry. But that's my own fault. I definitely want to go back the next time we're in Pittsburgh to try other dishes, in particular the chicken and waffles. The owners of this place are opening another spot soon and I'd definitely like to check that out as well!",2
"My son's and I really had a good time at ""It's Tricky. "" It is a family friendly show, my boys are 7 and 10, and they both had as much fun as I did. Definitely recommended if you are looking for some quality, family entertainment. Kyle is funny, witty, and has some old school tricks, as well as some new ones, that were pretty amazing.",2
"The bone in ribeye special was fantastic especially for the price that included a salad and potato. Most high end steakhouses would have charged that price for the steak alone. The wait staff and service was great once we finally got in. n nAnd that's why I only gave the place 2 stars. Honestly, the steak and wait staff deserved 5 stars, but the maitre d's will go out of their way to be assholes. Been here 3 times, and every single time I'm told there is a 45 min to 3 hour wait for a reservation and told I HAVE to make a reservation even when the restaurant is empty at 5pm on a Sunday or Monday night. n nEmpty when we walked in. Half empty when we returned for our mandatory ""reservation. "" Still half empty by the time we left. Why did we need a reservation? n nPlenty of waitstaff to cover the tables. Plenty of support staff to refill drinks and clear dishes after each course. So the only reason I can see for the forced wait time is to add an air of ""high end "" exclusivity, but guess what? MUCH better steakhouses like Del Frisco's or The Palm can accommodate walk ins with no wait during off peak times, and within 10 15 minutes during peak hours, so I have to assume the maitre d' is either trying to force us to kill time in the casino, just being a dick, or the place is horribly managed. n nEven through the food is great, it isn't worth a 3 hour wait, especially when there are options right down the road at the Silverton, the M, or Green Valley Ranch. n n3 strikes Silverado Steakhouse, you're out.",1
I came here to eat while waiting for my showtime at the Scottsdale IPIC Theater. It is a little on the pricey side but I enjoyed it. I had a rib eye sandwich and it was very good. It was lunch time and it was not very crowded on a Tuesday. The service was great and the waiter took the time to explain which were his favorites and why they were his favorites. He cared about us and it made us feel welcomed. I will definitely try this place again when in the area.,2
"If you're going here I would suggest going for the bagels or takeout items only. We were seated for 4, it was very busy but our waitress was not as attentive as she should've been. n nOne person ordered a Reuben and it was super lopsided, one half had all the fixings and the other had none making it difficult to eat. n nThe salmon Benedict came with poached eggs which were over done and the middle underneath was torn open with salmon which was super salty and the English muffin was barely toasted and overall the dish was lukewarm. n nAnother person in our party asked the waitress if there was an option to get just a plain bagel with cream cheese and lox sliced salmon no capers or tomatoes or anything else needed. She gave a complicated answer and ended up charging him for a platter includes cucumber, apr u00e8s, tomato, onion, olives, salmon, bagel and cream cheese 12 and brought it with only salmon bagel and cream cheese. You can't tell me there wasn't a cheaper and simpler option? n nThe bagel, cream cheese and lox were great. The service was rushed, in attentive and not personable. So I would only go back for take out bagels or bakery items and wouldn't sit down to eat.",1
Family of five had a great dinner! Our server Brandon was attentive and polite. I observed the manager making her rounds and she stopped to check on us twice. My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor. We will return soon!,2
