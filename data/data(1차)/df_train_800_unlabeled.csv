"This place is waaaay overpriced for the quality of food. I had two of the specials, grilled portobello mushroom and sea bass. The portobello was drenched in balsamic vinegar. Don't get me wrong, I love balsamic vinegar. I can just dip my bread in it plain but this was a very strong type and there was so much of it that I couldn't taste the mushrooms. As for the sea bass, I had asked for the olive oil drizzle to be removed and brought on the side since in most restaurants in the Burgh, drizzle means drench but it came with it anyways. When I complained, they took the fish and put it on a new plate with the olive oil scraped off. The sides that came with the entree were just sad. Some steamed veggies that tasted no different than steam in a bag grocery store variety and a bland rice with some peas. nThe bill for these two plus one glass of wine was 55. I had a groupon but it was still way way overpriced for the quality. The only reason I am giving them two stars instead of one is I should have asked for the price of the specials. I just assumed that the price of the sea bass would at least be comparable to the grilled salmon, which was 21. I was wrong since it was 35 despite being the size of my fist. nI will not be going back to this place and I do not recommend this to anyone who values quality over quantity.",1
I dont get how this place has so many great reviews. Customer service was terrible. I stopped in to discuss a cake for my housewarming. I arrived about 45 minutes before closing time but felt like i had completely inconvenienced the woman by stepping through the door. She seemed completely uninterested in listening to my ideas. I had the distinct feeling that she just wanted me to leave and quit bothering her. trying to salvation an unpleasant experience i bought a couple of cupcakes to take home. They certainly didnt make up for rest of it. Absolutely nothing special.,1
"Went with my daughter during my work lunch break. I had a restaurant coupon and since it was within walking distance from my workplace I decided to try them. n nIt is in the Roosevelt District, artsy, organic.so don't let the outside turn you off. When I went in, the establishment was clean including the bathroom which was operational . Christine was our server and she was very personable and informative. Since this was our first time at the restaurant she did recommend the Carnitas Torta. I am not a vegan or vegetarian but don't need meat everyday. This torta was made with Jackfruit n which she had to explain to me because I had never heard of it and cabbage. with the Chipotle and spices, it was WONDERFUL. It had a meaty taste and texture and all the flavors just came together. Even though it came with two halves, I could only finish one. My daughter finished both halves of her order, but neither of us felt stuffed after wards. My beverage was the fresh squeezed lemonade, sweetened with sparkling water. You can also have it unsweetened or with still water. It was just enough sweetness. My daughter had a Horchata. She said it was okay for a vegan version, but said she wouldn't order it again. n n I didn't order any desserts, but with the enjoyable experience we had, we will be returning.",2
"Groupon introduced this nice little place to us that was more than a wee bit away from the strip. n nIt truly was a miniature golf course as the name implies. It's not the mini golf courses you'd find as places like Scandia with the windmills and trick holes. It's as if they found a real golf course with the greens, rough, and sand traps and shrunk it. n nFun all the way around!",2
"If I could give this place the shadow of 1 star I would! I picked up my doggy and didn't think anything until the poor thing couldn't stop licking all his paws. I began to check him out and he turned out having a huge gash, open wound underneath his left eye! It looked like raw skin, I had to treat him with antibiotics. The reason why my dog was licking his paws was also because they were all cut up. When I originally picked him up, he was wearing this adorable bandana but when I removed it, there were patches of hair on his neck that weren't groomed. I'm feeling like the worse pet owner for having brought my pup here. n nTerrible service, would never put the life of my pup on their hands again!",1
"The pizza is excellent. I had a thin crust pie with amazing sausage, sun dried tomatoes and cheese! This is a wonderful place to get great food and a cold beer. They had Left Hand Milk Stout and 90 Shilling on tap which is always a plus. Prices are very reasonable, and there are literally dozens of TVs to watch any game that is on. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Can't wait until it warms up a bit so I can sit out on their nice patio.",2
The place just isn't the same since Lee sold out. I've tried to stay but at some point the wide selection of glitter and polishes does not outweigh technicians who don't know what they are doing and who are rude. I need a new place ,1
"A group of 16 of us were out of town and decided to go over to stone mountain grill. The manager told us he could not sit all of us together as we had such a large party even though you can make reservations online for 20 people. He said it would be to much for the waiter or waitress and we would all have ro sit seperately. He suggested next time we call a week ahead of time. Are u kidding me! We walked out, as to us that was not true service and they did not deserve our money!",1

"A nice change in pace when you get tired of the OG and Carraba's, the appetizers are tasty recommend the pesto bruchetta or the baked ravioli, the sauce is loaded with italian sausage and at times I find myself just eating the sauce with a fork, I'm a big fan of their calzone's lots of cheese, ample toppings puff's up like a good calzone should, the wait staff has been agreeable the times we've been there though we more often than not take out. I've also had the pizza and some pasta dishes and have been pleased with most, as I recall the sauces for one of the sausage and vodka sauce pasta's is ""very spicy "" and i'm not one to shy away from spicy food, so just a warning. n na good choice for italian in surprise",2
"O.K the outdoor seating on a bright sunny day was great. Service was fine. Wife wanted the half portion of fruit salad. It looked tired.some of the green grapes were turning yellow and only grapes and pineapple?. If you want a fruit salad bellagio cafe does much better. I ordered a bloody mary, at 12 no celery or olives? Sky Box grill at Aria has a 10 B.M that will rock your socks off. Had the fish tacos 2 for 12 . While the fish was fine the salsa was weird. Ate 75 of one of them and gave the wife the other. At about 40 with tip I can't say I was happy.",1
"Had dinner tonight, service was excellent food was lousy. The lamb chops had to be sent back 90 fat was no meat on the traps at all. Or the reserve a bone in New York steak came very dry the waiters will kindly replace both with fillets which were tasty. However, I make it better on my home real with me I buy from Cosco. n nMild Italian should start shopping at Cosco. They sell prime beef. n nTo quote my late father, ""now I've been there twice. The first time, and the last time. """,1
Great food great service. Best filipino food in vegas. And the filipino employees make you feel at home,2
"Not my choice for breakfast. Only reason I've come here is Amy C. likes this place for breakfast and being the good friend that I am, I oblige. I've been here and waited an obscene amount of time, and I've been here and seated right away. The menu isn't impressive. I swear it takes me longer to decide on what to eat than it does for them to prepare it. I've tried the Eggs Benedict and don't think anything of them. I am not a fan of breakfast potatoes, I prefer hash browns. That's a big negative on this place. I was craving banana walnut pancakes one time and I asked if they could make them, so I receive my pancakes with bananas and walnuts on top off the pancakes. What the heck? Shouldn't they be mixed in with the pancake batter? I know I had a perplexed look on my face and the waitress wasn't interested in asking me what the problem was. I feel the food here is comparable to IHOP or Denny's, no quality. I also dislike that you have to go up to the counter to pay. Why can't I leave my check and the tip on the table and leave when I'm done! I can only hope I can talk Amy C. into Cracked Egg instead.",1
"One of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been too which says a lot because Indian food is my all time favorite. Went there for lunch on a Saturday and the place was packed. Great prices and large portion sizes with a pretty large menu. Try the tali lunch special which is a great bang for your buck. Options include their famous butter chicken, curry lamb, or a vegetarian option. Had plenty of leftovers and although the service was a little slow I could not be mad because there were only two waiters working and since it was so crowded they were running around the whole time. They were very polite and continuously apologized but like I said I couldn't be mad they were doing the best they could Cash debit card only FYI.",2
"I suppose it depends on what you get, maybe some meals are better here but my chicken sandwich was public school cafeteria level with a little bit more spice. I would have rather had McDonalds. The waitress also heavily exaggerated the portions. M wife got the appetizer sampler which was much smaller than advertised it was okay but again I've had better and we were told the Super Nacho plate was HUGE! It was decent I guess and probably the best of any of the dishes we had. n nWon't be returning anytime soon.",1
"Flamingo Palace is the closest thing to East Coast Chinese food I've found. The house chicken is super tasty and they have really yummy rice. nYes it's a little worn inside and that fish in the tank needs a bigger tank, but it's well worth a visit. Delivery was also very quick.",2
Poor service. n nMy bro in law was stabbed so he was admitted here. n nThe nurses wouldn't check on him. His catheter was full and they didn't change it until a few hours after we told them. n nHe was supposed to have his IV changed out and they didn't to it until the next day. n nThe nurses are pretty much bitches.,1
"I walked in to get information. The only worker there was a trainer that told me he was finishing up a private lesson and would be right with me. After 15 minutes of walking around looking at their displays and not finding any infomation on their services and the trainer not acknowledging I was still waiting.I left. I understand he was in a private lesson. However, he should have given me a timeframe or at least asked what I needed. If you only have one person working in the store, you have to come up with a better system or have information that someone can take with them.",1
"I had the stuffed pancakes, it was stuffed and big. The coffee was good and the service quick. I enjoyed my meal and had a great breakfast. The place was bug and can accommodate a lot of customers.",2
"Good food. Awful service. The waiter was nowhere to be found when we needed our check, even though we slotted 2 hrs to get through our meal, kept our order super simple, told our server upfront when we needed to leave. We had to ask 2 other staff and finally chase him down on foot as he walked away while we continually said ""excuse me. "" I won't be back.",1
"OOOO i remember when they were just starting to develop the waterfront and everyone was buzzing about this place! Haha! People were very excited for premium seating, alcohol and hot meals! n nOn the scale of theaters its nice! The place huge, tons of theaters, very clean, a great concession stand and comfortable seating. There is a big parking lot, so parking is never an issue. n nIf you are out looking for a place to catch a movie in Pittsburgh, Lowes is the go to.",2
"I'd like to update my review of Red Carpet VIP. Based on my experience, I would not feel comfortable saying that ""I'm a fan "" or even that they're ""A ok. "" My friends and I did get that refund we were waiting for. However, this was only after I had requested it more than once and been accused of lying. nI've added a star because a representative that I had not dealth with during my stay in Vegas reached out to me with an apology for our subpar experience and a promise of a better experience should I try their services in the future. nI am glad to read that other Yelpers had a much much better experience than my friends and I had. Hopefully, our experience was simply a fluke and not due to anything else.",1

"Been going here for over a year, and I've always come back for the great Chinese and Thai food. However I ordered delivery, which took about an hour an order of Fried Wontons which were hard and cold , Thai iced tea that was warm with a little ice in it, and Pan Fried Noodles. I didn't have a problem with the noodles until I started eating and as I was thinking how tender the beef was I found a METAL STAPLE looking thing IN THE MEAT. It hurt my tooth even. Will never order here again sadly. ",1
"I am definitely no expert on Indian food, but since this this place serves nothing that even resembles that, I feel qualified to offer my thoughts. Once you get past the dismal decor of the ""restaurant "" itself and figure maybe the food will at least be ok, you get a dish slapped into a takout plate by a pleasant woman. It all goes downhill from there. I ordered the vegan lunch which consisted of Eggplant , Tofu and Vegetables and Tomato and Lentils over rice. All three were substandard. The eggplant was ok, but did not appear to be fresh.was visually unappealing and basically not good. n nThe lentils and tomato served over mushy brown rice not basmati , was light on both tomatoes and lentils but was passable as food. But by far the worst was the tofu. Large cubes swimming in a disgusting broth were like sponges of awfulness. Biting into one resulted in a gushing of water that looked like it came out of the Ganges river, thereby establishing it's only tangential connection to authentic Indian food. . Thank Annapurna the Hindu God of food and cooking , for the half a slice of whole wheat pita that was laying on top of the rest of this slop. n nMy understanding from what others tell me is there are better things to order on other days of the week. But I don't plan to return .maybe when it eventually becomes a Subway or Starbucks. n nHoping I don't get sick. n nJim",1
"Normally i have an okay time here. My last visit wasnt even okay. n nI didnt even get a chance to eat here and had to leave due to the terrible service. We took a seat at the bar and ordered the deep dish pizza we were craving all diggity day long and a brown ale, along with a couple waters. Then we watched the bartenders behind the bar have internal drama and not even look in our direction as we waited.and waited.annnnnnd waited. Neither the bar nor the dining area was busy or even half full and i sat for 17 minutes without even the orders for the waters go fulfilled. nAt that point i had seen enough and had to walk out before the food and drinks even arrived. I hated to do it but i could not support the staff and business where that could happen. n nThe bottom line is that it was a bad experience but the food i have had here in the past has always been solid, the beer is surprisingly good and priced very well.",1
"Freaking amazing! n nWay over priced. but its something that you only do once. Unless you are crazy wealthy. The tickets we had were about 200 a piece because the cheaper ones were sold out , and if you don't mind sitting in the nose bleeds you can tickets for 100. If you can afford it. I would defiantly recommend it. n nThis is the 2nd Cirque Du Soleil show I've seen. the first being Myst u00e8re at Treasure Island. This one was even more amazing, and if you only get to see one show. make it this one! Don't be cheep. see this show. It is worth it! n nMy only complaint. that I forgot to take a camera.",2
"Just want to start this out saying 1 star is being very generous! We ordered the combo lunch sandwich, salad, drink . When asking what our drink choices were to go with the combo we were told soda, beer, coffee, etc. and no up charge total scam . We also asked for water for the whole table. The waiter returned with a pitcher of water no ice and 4 paper coffee cups that were previously used. There was lipstick on some of the cups, a lemon slice in the bottom of one of the glasses from the previous persons drink. When we called out our 12 year old waiter owners son he took the cups and returned with more paper cups that were previously used! Really? Who washes out paper cups and tries to reuse them? This was all before the food! Cold soggy fries salad with no dressing left us disgusted to say the least. We went to pay inside to discuss our billing and other issues to the 14 year old at the register owners other son and he was very unprofessional and started arguing with us in front of others that were waiting to pay also! They charged us for our drinks that were supposed to be included on the combo meal that we ordered. Don't waste your time and money coming here! There are so many great restaurants in Montr u00e9al but this is NOT one if them.",1
" Rating only on food nWhere to start. I guess I'll start with the good, then the bad as sadly there was some things that stood out that irked the party as well as came off a little ""odd. "" n nFor appetizers nWe ordered the Pork Belly, Deviled Eggs, and the Jumbalaya. It was all delicious, however the only question was on the deviled eggs was served on some wine menus. Is that to soak up water or something? Maybe it was to hint to get some wine? I've always known that whatever you place on the dish should be edible. Maybe they didn't get the memo My best guess is that is so it doesn't slide off the dish, but still there has to be a more creative solution. nThe Jumbalaya was the winner in the appetizer choices though. It had flavor and a little kick at the end to top it all off. n nEntre u00e9 nI ordered the 22 Oz ribeye steak. Oscar style. Which meant that there was crab meat on top Was it good? Yep. Do I suggest you to get it? Yes, only if you brought a big appetite with you because that was one pretty big ribeye. But of course, I finished it. nSides that you have to try out are the mac and cheese. Those are amazing. n nNow to the bad nOur waiter's name was Amy.and well some things went down before my brother and I got there and some things after I arrived. My party told me when I arrived about 20 minutes late that the waiter came up twice about when we were getting there. First telling my party that at 7 30 there was another table coming and that the whole party wasn't here. Second time complaining about when we were coming. n nNow when both of us came, I observed she was very touchy and feely. She caressed my mother's arm and then proceeded to ask her if she shaved her arms, and then went to my father and caressed his arm. what the fuck? Anyways, I saw her come back and then apologize for rushing us to order and the previous comments, however this was after we ordered 200 worth of food. I think she wanted to make sure she had a tip at the end. She continued to say that management was rushing her. Way to blame it on the people who hired you. n nShe constantly made weird comments throughout the night. Such as ""I got this cake from that table, because they wanted to give it to me. "" Or how about taking a customer's baby and then proceeding to introduce the baby to other tables. n nLet's just say, this restaurant is not a family restaurant. I'm pretty sure that's not the ambiance that they are going for. It's a pretty high class steakhouse.With some feelings from my party of being judged of not having enough money to pay for the meal to just weird comments or inappropriate touching of customers.It changes the experience. n nBut, if I was to solely judge the food. It's definitely a place to go eat, I definitely will be back again.but I'll ask not to get this waiter again, or else I'll switch tables. I know this is a 5 star restaurant in my books, but you know what they say, when the service is off the food will feel a little off as well.",2
"I'm sorry, but I feel I have to update my review and not for the better. Megabus just doesn't cut it for me anymore. Here are the reasons why n n1. Major, unnecessary attitude from drivers, esp. during busy times around Thanksgiving and Christmas New Year's . This includes reading passengers the riot act as soon as the bus gets moving with no particular reason, which includes threatening to leave passengers stranded, as well as unreasonable requests that passengers refrain from using scented lotion, etc. I've never gotten such attitude from drivers on either Greyhound or Amtrak, and I'm wondering if it has to do with poor pay and working conditions Amtrak conductors are unionized and paid better not sure about Greyhound . n n2. Inconsistent and overly strict baggage enforcement. My bags are under their specifications, and I've caught flak from drivers about it before. See other reviews for even worse complaints . In contrast, my bags are slightly over Amtrak's specs, and none of the conductors have ever said anything to me about it before. n n3. Cramped and uncomfortable seating, with little opportunity to get up and move around. I almost always felt cramped when I got off the bus. This became particularly apparent to me after I started riding Amtrak, which provides much more legroom. Seat pitch is about the same as Greyhound, so if you don't mind that, then you'll be okay, I guess. n n4. Poorly functioning amenities the wifi rarely works, and when it does, it's extremely spotty. I've also encountered power outlets that didn't work on occasion. Don't believe their advertising campaigns about either the wifi or power outlets! Neither Greyhound nor Amtrak make such claims, and although wifi isn't available on the whole train, if you sit in the cafe car, you can get it and it's pretty reliable, in my experience. n n5. Poor customer service this is the real dealbreaker for me with any business. As others have mentioned, if you accidentally book the wrong date or need to change your travel plans, you're SOL with Megabus. Even Greyhound allows passengers to change itineraries even though you have to show up in person and there's a 20 change fee! On Amtrak, you can change your itinerary without any change fee the only time you'll encounter an upcharge is if the fares are higher on the day that you want to change to. Not sure about refunds credits if the fares are lower. n nAbout the only factor Megabus has going for it are the inexpensiveness of the fares. Between all of the other factors listed above, I've decided that it's worth it to me to pay an extra 30 or so to ride Amtrak hassle free to Philly. As such, Megabus won't be seeing any more of my money again anytime soon!",1

"I bought some T Shirts for my kids from the shop when I was in Vegas and then by accident left the bag in a restaurant on the strip. I just wanted to replace what I lost for my kids since they are ticked off, so I go to their website to look for an on line store. n nThe on line store at www.gspawn.com has been broken for quite a while. You can't check out or create an account. Filled out the on line contact form weeks ago and no response. I guess they must not care because you'd think they would wonder why they aren't getting any orders. I even called the shop, selected the pawn counter, but it just goes to voicemail and the mailbox recording says it's full and no more messages can be accepted. n nThey should just take the shop off their website if they can't get it fixed. n nBTW The shop is small and sort of dirty. The carpet looks like it was last replaced in 1981 and they must not own a vacuum cleaner. Plus, It has that old building smell that catches you when you first enter. n nLike other reviewers stated, the actual pawned merchandise is over priced and a good third of the floor space is now dedicated to t shirts, mugs, bobble heads, etc. n nIf you are planning a visit, go after 5 00PM as there isn't much of a line then. If you go during the day, you will stand in line, but you may see some of the stars from the show. n nTravis and Andy, two of the shop employees, were extremely nice.

Most micro breweries I've been to offer a 4 5 sampler. Four Peaks offered an eight drink fight. The tray for the beer's was already labelled with which beer was which.

"At first I thought this spine doctor pain management doctor was having a bad or long day on my first visit. He was very cold, arrogant and disinterested.

The sauces in particular were flavorful, and the meat and pastas also well prepared. The service was attentive. n nI'm docking this restaurant one star for atmosphere on a Saturday night.specifically, there was a singer who was very good, by the way whose mic was way too loud, making it virtually impossible to have a quiet conversation due to EVERYONE in the restaurant raising their voices to talk over the singer's mic. A shame that this situation was so noticeable that it requires this specific criticism, affecting an otherwise lovely meal. n nI would certainly recommend this place on a night without the entertainment.",2
"Dr. Nagy may be a fabulous podiatrist, but since the rules of the office are to require I provide my Social Security Number, I didn't get the chance to see him.they refused to see me. I do NOT give out that information unless I am filling out a credit application, which I was not. We will let the HIPAA review board sort that one out since I have already filed a complaint. In the meantime, I'm off to find another podiatrist, which is sad to me because Dr. Nagy has such great reviews. Now IF I didn't have insurance that they verified and IF they had mentioned some of this on the phone when I called, maybe I could have understood. But to be told I couldn't even see the doctor if I didn't provide my SSN is ridiculous and I think a true HIPAA violation, but we will see . But they did not. I have satisfied my deductibles for the year, so my visit would have been covered at 100 by my insurance. And they knew all of that.",1
"This place pho king sucks. n nMe and my buddies came here on the last day of our edc weekend before the long drive back to SF. n n Warning do not order the fruit drinks, they are made w powder and taste super generic and sweet aka fake. We were like oh its 137 degrees outside, a nice watermelon, or pineapple, or strawberry drink sounds amazing and refreshing, when we got it we all literally took one sip and didn't drink it after that. Oh but they looked like they could glow in the dark, i guess that's kinda cool? n nOn top of that the pho took forever to come, maybe they forgot, but the ones who ordered rice plates pretty much finished it before the pho even came. Pho should take no more than a few minutes to come out, not over 10 minutes. I must say it's understandable for the ones including myself to finish our rice plates first because portion wise they were probably made for babies. I had one tiny porkchop and some rice, usually at Vietnamese restaurants you're not able to see the bottom of your plate because its filled with food, but this plate was very bare. n nBottomline food took forever, drinks sucked, and for 5 guys the bill came out to 80. Pho'ck that. n nOH and on top of that, they gave us the bill before our pho even came! probably because they noticed some of our plates empty wow.best believe we didn't tip.",1

"Personal training here is not what you would think. Don't let them tell you that they will help you with a plan. They never helped with the eating portion of personal training, never developed a plan for working out and couldn't handle my medical issue. They simply told you what to do when you were there! I tried to call the manager many times regarding cancellation with no return phone calls. When i did finally reach him, he told me to call corporate. Corporate didn't return my phone call for a couple of weeks. All of this kept me from cancelling within a timeframe as not to cost me extra money. VERY hard to cancel. They told me that it would be easy to cancel if they couldn't work around my medical issue. DO NOT BELIEVE THEM!",1
"I had the yakisoba noodles with tofu. It was more food than one person can eat. My meal also came with soup, salad and fried rice. The special sauce they use on the noodles is tasty and brings out the flavor of all the different veggies. Although, I've been to a few Benihanas I personally enjoyed the location in Scottsdale. It's clean, not too cold and the service was excellent. n nThis is also a good meal to order when ordering to go. I've done that a few times in the past. n nEnjoy!",2
"This small sized cafe has big heart. The owner and head chef, Amy, is personable and caring. Her menu showcases tasty southern classics with a twist. The white cheddar Pimento Cheese dip, Potatoes Brava, Mac and Cheese meatloaf, and Chop Salads, and the Shepard's Pie are some of my favorites. n nThe Flipside Cafe supports and purchases produce from local farms which is another reason to feel good about coming in. n nSince it is such a small place it can get a bit crowded during lunch but it's a friendly atmosphere and I would definitely recommend it to friends nonetheless. n nAmy and the staff are really great!",2

"Bleah Ugh.puke Fast food. Ok so it's chicken.Mmmm But it's fast food chicken in a little hole in the wall place shaped like a barn. Uhm.ok farmers.get their chickens from chicken coops and yes.the occasional barn. So I had the ""gobbler "" and a couple thighs from there. Ok turkey breast? Turkeys aren't that small.Chicken.Albertson's Fried Chicken was just as good if not better. But the snot nosed kid who tried to take my order and give me some small ass chicken just wasn't that bright. Ok ok yes Myke you're a jerk because at least he has a job and he's not stealing cars or in a gang.or better yet going door to door and selling giant candy. So wanna know something special about this place that makes chicken worth coming back to.? Ask Damon. Seriously. WHAT THE HELL IS a CLUCKEETO?",1
"I give this place a 10 out of 5 stars! Seriously, I cannot tell you how much I love their coffee. I am officially a coffee snob after loving their coffee for so long. I always have their beans at home to enjoy and stop by when I can for a specialty drink hello, White Zombie! . The employees are wonderful and attentive and consistent! Now that my husband and I have moved away from Madison sadly we appreciate and miss their coffee even more. We stock up on beans every time we're in town. We cannot find any other coffee shop or roasters who even come close to comparison. Truly. Madison, you have no idea how lucky you are to have Ancora! ",2
"How is it that America has yet to discover poutine or, rather, how is it that poutine wasn't invented by the Americans ? French fries, slathered in gravy, drowned in cheese curds and occasionally submerged by a meat topping, if you so desire? It's just the sort of disgustingly delicious fare that Americans seem to crave. Perhaps it's good that it's only available up here, otherwise I'd be back home eating it every day and packing on the pounds. Anyhow. n nHungry, looking for a quick and tasty bite and acting more touristy than I'd care to admit, I stopped in Montreal Poutine looking for some good Canadian fare. Having heard a little about poutine, I was initially surprised to learn that the base poutine was in fact vegetarian I later found out that this isn't an uncommon occurrence, but at the time it was a selling point . I ordered the avocado fries and poutine with mushrooms and onions. The avocado fries had the most interesting texture and came with a little pot of creme fraiche excuse lack of accented letters , which ended up being the perfect dip I wouldn't have wanted anything more complex. n nPoutine is most certainly not my specialty, but I was pleased with what the server presented me. The onions were well caramelized, the mushrooms were small and tasty, and the fries were a little too small for my tastes but otherwise very, very good. Those two dishes were not quite enough for two to share, but I definitely would not have wanted my own plate. Pair with a glass of sangria and it made for a very tasty late lunch. Service was decent but nothing to write home about.",2
"Charming atmosphere.good drinks, great dessert but the middle was totally lacking. n nI couldn't even take more than 3 bites of the Montilana beef in sherry wine sauce if that's what you call it. It was god awful. I haven't had a bad meal like that in ages. n nThe server didn't even bother to ask if I wanted something else. I don't call that good service. n nThe mexican con leche cake was good, but I won't be jumping up and down to have dinner there again!",1
"Great food, wonderful flavors and the perfect place to splurge on a special date for two. Pricey but worth it. n nI saw Wayne's tip about the coupon at http www.restaurant.com le sans souci french restaurant cave creek french pid 36877 and bought one too. Seated nearly immediately in a restaurant that was just over half full. nWe heeded fellow Yelpers' advice and got Escargo, Ceasar salad, brochette and duck l'orange for our dinner selection. Portions were on par or larger with great flavors that were wonderful. Ms. D is a Francophile and was very impressed which made me happy. n nDessert was Creme Brulee for her and Chocolate Mousse for I with great coffee. Desserts were far too big for us as was the after dinner drink. My Grand Marnier must have been a double! n nExcellent food, proper service and a great selection lends this an easy 5 star review",2
"Pork on a Fork is an unexpected awesome BBQ place in the north valley. If you're from Nebraska like me you may appreciate the Cornhuskers ""N "" on the smoker and picture of windmills farmers in the dining area. To me, those are a few of the reasons why I left that terrible place. No points lost though. n nI have only been here during lunch and they usually have a line at the door, come early. Their brisket, BBQ pork, beans and waffle fries are hot, tasty and fresh. PoaF's meat is awesome. The cornbread is good too. The portions are big too, I typically have to fight the afternoon food coma but it's worth it. n nTheir sauces aren't anything fantastic, but I enjoy the spicy sauce. The dining areas have flat screen TV's and aren't bad, but the chairs and tables are picnic quality.",2
"I can't complain for a cheap strip hotel the Excalibur is the one. We paid 300 with fees for 3 nights on a busy weekend, slipped the woman at the desk an extra 20 and got ourselves a renovated room with pool view while the rest of our party ended up with a roof view in the old tower. Worth it. The front desk staff wasn't helpful otherwise but housekeeping was fine and everything was clean. n nThe casino itself is nothing special and the castle theme is more or less nonexistent. However, the pool was a lot nicer than I thought it would be and it wasn't full of d bags like other pools. I'll stay at Excalibur again.",2
"One star on YELP Eek! Methinks not! That was a literal response to MILOS. So literal we never ate in the place. n nYes. That's right. I'm giving this place one star and I didn't eat or drink there. How does a fair critic pull THAT off? Read below and I'll think you'll grok how. n nI brought my sig other and parents to this place, hoping for a Greek meal of some sort. What we got was basically a Greek 'fish house', which for my vegetarian partner in cuisine crime, negated the point of going. The idea that hummus and such was 'passe' took the Greek out of the Greek for her. But putting that aside n n why ditch a lovely restaurant in the Cosmo for being a fish house? Simple they attempted to scam us. n nWe sat down at a table and we were not brought menus. Instead a nice waiter type arrives and informs us of 'how things work'. That he would walk us over to the on premise 'fish store', we'd pick out some fish, and he'd guide us on their prep. n nThe question that should be gnawing at you now is, wait, what if you don't mind meats but don't want fish? Is there ANYTHING ELSE on the menu besides fish? Why yes, of course, but the waiter gave you the impression he'd rather not go there. That you'd kind of be a loser to not be in a fish mood in this Greek fish 'emporium'. n nDo you feel that at the back of your neck yet? That something seems off? Let me give you another hint the waiter waxed poetic about how all their fish is flown in fresh. At first this sounds impressive. Until you remember you're in the Mojave Desert. And you remember that nearly all fish everywhere is flown in from elsewhere. n nSo we insisted on seeing the menu. And guess what? The prices were THRU THE ROOF. An 80 rib eye. That's even high for strip standards, people. Trust me, there were no pearls or diamonds offered as side dishes. So we finally walked over to the fish in ice market, which were all about 60 a pound. n nAsk yourself what magical tricks MILOS could possibly have to make fish worth 60 a pound? Unless they offered a belly dancer under the table offering exotic lap dances there's absolutely nothing special about olive oiling fish and grilling it. n nListen I understand if a place wants to be a high end restaurant and experience. The decor and the way you are seated greeted should make the four dollar signs perfectly obvious to an innocent visitor. It wasn't so obvious. n nOne way to make it painfully obvious is to drop the menus down immediately. What MILOS was instead attempting was carpet salesman sleezeballery. n nThat's why we left.",1
"First time going in the restaurant had a great view of Lake Las Vegas. We we're waiting for our food too long. Unfortunately, one of the orders for our group had hair on it. Yuck! The waitress felt like she didn't even want to be working that day. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be going back.",1
I got the club. Being as though I am from Jersey and our club is turkey without ham the sandwich was ok. I feel that kraft singles do not belong on any sandwich whatsoever so I was taking that off my club. The fries were horrible. They reminded me of when BK changed their fries to that weird crispy and then over cooked. French fries should be easy.dont get cheap on the fries and dont put kraft singles on sandwiches. Judy is a great waitress. She was extremely friendly.,1
I agree with Glenn about this Wendy's is on top of it with there service but check out the pic of the Chicken Sandwich I ordered with lettuce. WITH LETTUCE. Haha What the hell is this. lol I just had to laugh and take a pic when I opened this up. I usually only go here for fries and frostys.,1
I'm extremely disappointed with RECON's quality of work. I originally started out with a couple small scratches around the passenger front running light. I called Dave and was very specific in that if he could not deliver a factory finish I did not want it done and would go to a regular body shop. He guaranteed a factory finish and that I would never know anything ever happened. Since space is so limited for this review long story short after three attempts to fix the bumper it is worse than ever and he will not refund my 250. I know pictures are worth a thousand words so here is the link to my photobucket album with pictures to back all this up. http s32.photobucket.com albums d36 ksguy Recon 20Mobile 20Bumper 20Repair ,1

I'm OUT!",1
"Definitely a fan and this restaurant will become a ""regular "" for us. If you need gluten free or other special dietary options Picazzo's is great! Having visited the restaurant at the Promenade off Frank Lloyd Wright and also the one in Sedona, I would say this was the ""middle "" experience. Sedona was our best experience could it have been all the hiking we did before going there? and Frank Lloyd Wright was just average. n nAt this Picazzo's on Cactus we sat on the patio next to the fire. Had great dolmas for an appetizer, FAB Thai peanut pasta gluten free! and sulfite free wine. As someone with food sensitivities this was BY FAR the best I've felt after eating out at an Italian restaurant. n nDefinitely check out Picazzo's they are willing to modify anything and will satisfy even the non gluten free folks in your group.",2
"There's only one thing preventing this bar from being Platonically perfect and that's those damn video gambling machines mounted into the surface of the main bar. But this is Las Vegas after all, and expecting not to find crap like this blighting every available space would be like expecting Williamsburg free of facial hair and ironic tee shirts. Otherwise, as noted, this place is a pretty perfect dive and a welcome respite to anything even tangentially related to the Strip. Cheap liquor, cheap drinks and as pleasantly worn in and seedy as college apartment furniture, this deliciously dark hole never closes, sports a million wry stickers of bands you've never heard of but should , hosts a mockingly friendly clientele of happy drunks and has the absolute finest indie hipster jukebox outside the Mission District. There's not much LA would benefit from in borrowing things from Vegas, but we could use this bar and more like it.",2
"I've been to plenty of casino buffets and I think that this one is pretty good. The decor and food presentation are on the fancier side for a buffet, but the restaurant still has a very casual feel to it. There's a good selection of food and a huge offering of desserts. I quite liked the pizza, scallops, fried calamari, and chicken caesar salad to name a few. The desserts were fresh and of really good quality, so they definitely aren't there just for show. Besides just cakes and pies, they also offer an array of parfaits, tarts, gelato sorbet that is scooped for you, and a great selection of mixed berries not in the dessert area . n nOne downside, our waitress was not particularly attentive and could have provided much better service. However, the lady who was working in the dessert section who scooped my sorbet for me was really nice.",2
"I called them at a little after 2 00 p.m. to take me to pick up my truck before the auto shop doing the repairs closed on a Sat. After about an hour and no show, I called them back. They said they normally only operate on the strip and in Henderson and that they hadn't gotten a driver to take the call yet. By the way, the destination was even further from the strip than my house. n nWhy didn't they tell me that from the start. They had my address and knew where I lived. I said fine, just let me know when you're coming. In the meantime I called another cab company. They said 40 minutes to an hour so I figured I'd just wait. n nAfter about another hour went by, I called them again. They said they still didn't have a driver taking the call. They asked If I had called another cab company and when I said yes, ""only to get an estimate on time "". Whittlesea stated, ""you can't do that "". n nAnyway, I got a call from my mechanic stating they couldn't wait anymore around 4 30 p.m. I had to call Whittlesea back to tell them forget it. At that time they still didn't have a driver assigned. n nHow much do you want to bet if I told them my destination was the strip, I could have gotten somebody. Guess what, in the customer service industry sometimes you have to take jobs that don't always pay as much. n nI told them I'd have to pick my truck on on Monday and sure the hell wouldn't call them for that to take me anywhere, EVER. n nP.S. Who here actually believes that people from other cities who left mostly positive if not all reviews would take the time to do so. The reality is that most people only bother to leave reviews when the service is bad. Looks like b.s. to me.",1
"This hotel was arranged for us by Holland cruise line. It is centrally located.closer to old town, has an indoor pool, spa, sauna, and exercise room with a few machines. Our room was amazing.large with a beautiful bath with a tub and shower.very roomy. Internet is available for free in the lobby but if you join their club, no free to join, the Internet will also be free in your room. It is a beautiful hotel which by the way doesn't look like from the outside . Don't expect a magnificent view from the window.but who cares. The hop on hop off bus is a couple of blocks away. All the people who work here are very helpful and friendly. We did not have extra fees.",2
"Great UFC bar no cover charge Great drink specials food's pretty good, too.",2
"A lot of people working, but seemed no one was in charge. Place only had 5 sets of customers, yet took forever to get our meals. Staff used rags to wipe tables to hold our plates. One employee kept wiping her nose with her finger over and over. I wonder if she has a food handlers card.",1
"Better than anticipated! I never expect much when I see something at Planet Hollywood theater. They usually put the cheapo mediocre shows in that place. But this was good. The host was funny and talented, and many of the acts were very good also. The two balancing men were good seen them before in other shows though . The juggling was great. The man with the masks created a comedic show using audience members one of my favorite parts . The magic lady was just okay. Small cute theater, with drink service. A nice little evening.",2
"I'm a little embarrased to say that the girls in here know my man and I by order. It's sufficient to say that we head over to this amazing place quite frequently, and I don't see that every changing. n nThe salads are so amazing, that I find myself literally craving them in the middle of the day. Gyro meat is to die for good, and the mix combination plate gives you a sample of everything. n nI typically either go with the combo for two, or the lo carb chicken plate, then I kinda defeat the purpose and order a side of pita bread order the greek pita, so much better than the thin pita . n nAlso, greek fries, you might ask, ""what are those? "" Order them. Now. n nPLUS, Blue Moon on draft? I mean cmon, you must go but don't go when I go because I enjoy having the quiet moment to enjoy the most amazing greek food to ever touch my lips.",2
"Place is clean but the service wasn't friendly. The two men at front desk was just there, didn't greet us when our party of 4 came in. They were a little unorganized. My massage started out decent until he really put so much pressure on my back that it is still hurting today, 4 days later. I don't think he knew exactly what he was doing when he massage the lower back. I have gone to countless massage places and this is the first time my back hurt this badly where I can hardly bend my back without feeling the pain. I had this feeling once when I pinched my sciatic nerve by carrying heavy boxes during a move but never from anything else, let alone a massage. I would not come back and will avoid places like these in a long while.",1
"Best of Philly in my opinion is hands down the Best Cheese Steak in the Valley. n nThey build sandwiches to your liking with fresh baked bread, lean steak grilled with olive oil and real American cheese. n nYes the place is small, however the owner has a giant heart. He and his wife have stayed true to form and their passion for cleanliness and quality shines through with every menu item. n nMy business partner and I have made the pilgrimage to Best of Philly in Phoenix every week from Tempe for six years running. n nBest of Philly experimented with a second location in Mesa however, they sold that store off, so be sure to stick to the real deal and grab a coupon from the website.",2
"I'll preface this review by saying that I eat here ALL THE TIME and have never had a bad meal. However, some menu items are better than others, in my opinion. n nSo you're probably wondering about the catfish. I love it. I love it to the point that my seafood fanatic husband couldn't touch another piece of fried fish for six months after I made him eat catfish for dinner daily for two weeks. Luckily he's over his aversion, as we went through the highly convenient drive thru just the other day! I won't say this is the end all, best catfish in the world, but it's in my top two or three. n nThe ribs are really good too. I'm usually cautious about ordering ribs because I am very picky about them. My usual fears are unfounded, as The Hush Puppy prepares them just the way I like them crispy charred on the outside, falling off the bone and not sauced to death. I take it a step further by ordering their excellent, btw barbeque sauce on the side rather than slathered on the ribs themselves. The Wednesday and Saturday too, at the Nellis location AYCE rib special comes with catfish, fried shrimp and probably some other stuff I cannot recall. I think one time I was able to eat judicially enough to be able to order a second plate of the ribs, but AYCE for me these days translates to ""damn, not nearly enough! "". n nFor those of us not wanting to die of a heart attack on the way out of the restaurant, I can recommend a couple of ""lighter "" options. The crab legs platter is ridiculously cheap and B I G. There's also a combo plate featuring only grilled items ""Cajun Fantasy "". It comes with a blackened catfish fillet, a skewer of grilled shrimp and stuffed oysters, if I'm remembering correctly. It's definitely not a heavy dinner and is the only thing I've ever ordered that I am able to finish. n nThe basket of bullet shaped hush puppies brought to the table shortly after sitting down is always solid. I like them with or without the honey butter, but c'mon, what WOULDN'T be made better by honey butter? I've always been accustomed to more savory hush puppies, usually with onion inside. This is an interesting change. n nThere's a small salad and condiment bar offering up a good chow chow which I will put in and on nearly everything on my plate , tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, some typical salad items dressings, coleslaw, potato macaroni salads and maybe one or two other things I am forgetting. I usually make myself a little salad, take a spoonful or two of the mayo based stuff and get my condiments before dinner. I was initially taken aback by the fact that you get your own sauces, but I quickly realized that for a sauce Nazi such as myself, it's a blessing. I've always found the salad bar area clean and with fresh items, personally. n nThe restaurant itself is rather oddly decorated and has many different rooms corridors. Half the time I get lost on my way to and from the salad bar. That's okay though, and I think it would be a brillant place for a large group, since many of the ""rooms "" have just a couple of tables. More often than not, I hit up the drive thru, though the drive thru's menu is limited. Great value, whether or not you eat inside, and you can feel good about supporting a long standing local eatery!",2

"I was pretty disappointed with this place. We went Thursday night for dinner and were really ready for this amazing dinner and a few items were really good, but much of it was so lacking that overall we weren't impressed. n nGood things nService was great very friendly people and drinks refilled constantly. nLots to pick from nDessert wow! their new york cheesecake and creme brulee was devine! nLobster mac cheese delicious nLobster bisque clam chowder both were really good n nBiggest complaints nthere were NO lobster tails Not sure if they only put them out on certain nights, but bummed that there weren't any when we were there, yet other yelp reviews have people raving about them. The only actual 'lobster' that was out was what they called a lobster medley with small pieces of lobster in the shell. These tasted ok, but were supposed to be warm, but were barely lukewarm, making it a bit odd. n ncrab legs weren't good. they were cold, which was fine, but seemed as if they'd been soaked in water for a long time so the crab itself was completely mushy. I've had better crab at red lobster if that's any indication n nIn the end, not somewhere I'll ever visit again. Totally not worth the money they charge for it. Other buffets are better and cheaper.",1
"Going to a home improvement store isn't exactly something I love to do. It usually involves work once you leave. That being said, this Home Depot does make it about as painless as possible to get in and out as any I've been to. n nThe location is so obscure that I don't think many people come here so that makes it very easy to get in, get what you need and get out without a lot of hassle.",2

Mmm. Delicious custard to help save you from that blazing Las Vegas sun. Rich and creamy. You need to get some. n nCASH ONLY though.,2
"My fianc u00e9 and I just moved to Goodyear and were excited to start trying some of the restaurants in the area. We ate at Royal Jasmine Thai for the first and only time last night 2 7 14. We walked in and were told to seat ourselves at a booth right by the door. We sat there for about 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us in anyway. We were actually discussing whether or not we should just leave when a girl finally came over to take a drink order. Someone else brought over our two sodas a few minutes later. A little bit later the first girl came back and took our food order. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees which ranged from good not great to not good at all. A third person brought our food out after a while, and that was the last time a staff member actually came to our table. We ate the entire meal with empty sodas, no knife only 1 fork each to eat with , and an entr u00e9e I couldn't eat. I ate my rice and some of the appetizer waiting for someone to come over to we could ask for refills, a different entr u00e9e, and a knife to eat what we did have. My fianc u00e9 ended up finishing his entr u00e9e and we decided we were just done. At this point, since no one had been to our table since the food was brought out I looked at the time on my phone. After a full TWENTY FIVE minutes passed which has to be at least 35 minutes with no one coming to the table to check on us , I got up and walked up to a staff member at the bar and requested our check and complained. She did apologize and take the entr u00e9e I didn't eat off our check. She also offered a complimentary dessert, but we declined since we didn't want to sit at the booth another 30 minutes. My fianc u00e9 and I agreed it is the worst dining experience we've ever had together. We will not be back.",1
"Sadly disappointed. n nWe arrived at 7 30 for our reservation to a 1 2 full restaurant and were seated next to a children's table. We ordered a bottle of local wine and our meals which, albeit experimental, were disappointing. The veal was tough and the pork was dull. n nWorst of all, after we finished our expensive but unexciting meal, it took nearly an hour of being ignored by our server before we could leave. For what we paid nearly 300 , we expected a level of service that was sorely lacking at DNA.",1
Worst hotel ever stayed at. Don't stay unless you're down in the dumps. We left early to go home because we couldn't stay any longer at this dump. Raggedy on all levels. I'm still itching and hope I didn't bring bed bugs home. Smelled weed throughout the place and even outside. Would be zero stars.,1
"Disclaimer for a weekend night the parking lot was beyond a nightmere.imagine the mall on Saturday December 23rd. We actually saw a guy steal a spot and then just about get into a fist fight over it, THEY WERE OUT OF THEIR CARS PEOPLE! FYI, with a little patience we found a great spot close to the enterance. n nFor a chain.this place is AWESOME! First of all the garden and fountains had me 100 even if the food had sucked which it didnt . Live music and cocktails while sitting in lush foliage with the sound of running water and the beauty of sparkling light made the 2 hour wait worth it it was friday night, I've been told its not that bad on other days . You pretty much HAVE to try the Spamp Thing cocktail.its the strongest bomb pop you'll ever drink. We also sampled a strawberry peach cooler and a 'catagory 5', also fantastic. n nOur server was great. Charles Chester was double sat but did an awesome job of making us feel as though we were his only table. The general atmospher is very southern bayou with dim lighting and gas lamps, pretty unique for phoenix even if it might be considered cliche. And listen here ladies, that flickering gas light does WONDERS for the complextion! n nAlligator bites, eh.but the Lousiana Talipia I had served with green beans and spagetti squash was SOOOOOO GOOOODDD! Plus I added a garden salad which was huge.I actually ate very little of my meal due to this for 2.95. Where do you see THAT price anymore? My dinner partners enjoyed a blackened talipia with dirty rice, fried catfish with fries, and a steak with mash potatoes and brocoli. There was not a single complaint at our table! n nDessert was great. Pappadeaux has those cheesy 80's dessert trays where everything has a coat of acrylic to keep it looking fresh.I LOVE those corny presentation trays! FYI Pappadeaux has maybe 15 options for dessert? Pretty impressive. As a first time visitor we were offered a dessert on the house WOW and choose a chocolate brownie turtle thingie which was served warm w some yumm o vanilla ice cream. The single slice was HUGE, even shared between the 4 of us we hardly finished it. Somehow we were able to force it down n nFor the price i thought the meal was a good value with plenty of fresh options. The only think I'm dissappointed about is that Pappadeaux is not actually locally owned, although it is family owned. It doesnt feel chain y but I still try to avoid them as much as possible.",2
We tried this place today. There is a lot of parking and it is easy to get in and out of the parking lot. We went right at 12 30pm and it was pretty busy inside. There is a Honeywell directly behind the building and it was full of their employees. But there was seating outside as well. The service was a little slow and the cashier didn't seem like she really wanted to be there. The food was great! We both had the Gyro Pita It was packed with meat and sauce. The pita was fluffy and fresh. The meat was a mixture and it was full of flavor! The portion was very large and came with fries and a drink for only 8. I would definitely return.,2
"My brother and I had a great experience here last Wednesday while traveling in Phoenix. Stopped by to take advantage of the free wifi, breakfast, and hot drinks. I ordered the Tomato Tom ato egg sandwich great vegetarian option with greens protein along with a cup of hot chai, and both were very tasty. Comfortable atmosphere and seating, friendly service, clean facility, wifi worked great, no complaints! As an added bonus, our server handed out free baseball tickets to the D backs Pirates on a day when we actually could make the time to go! How often does that happen? ",2
"Not a very big fan of mexican food but this place has some very good menu items that are authentic and tasty. Their rice is amazing, I always have a hard time finding a restaurant with good spanish rice. The salsa is so good and I always oreder some to go. The service is always spot on, and the deep fried ice cream is to die for!",2
"I am a fan for this swiss army knife of a convenience store and gas station. It is safely within walking distance from home. Perfect for hailing a cab. Picking up some forgotten items on the way home. Gas prices are usually a little higher being UNLV Strip Airport adjacent. It does most things well in a pinch. When your gas range is at 5miles. When you're dragging ass and need a good deal on energy drink. When you need to get a couple two liters or some in a pinch booze. This is the jumpoff. and end of your weekend as a visitor. other than that, as a local, I'm jist glad it's there.",2
"So, today Wednesday we went to the Heart and Soul cafe to get breakfast. Now, apparently they stop serving breakfast at 11 30 on weekdays, and since we were already there all the way from Peoria, we decided to give lunch a go. So, there menu wasn't horribly diverse, but we managed to get something that suited our tastes. I got a turkey BLT and my mother got a. I think it was something like a southwestern burger it had chilies . We got a seat right in front of the car booth, and it was a nice spot. The server was nice and friendly and the only thing that she messed up on was that at the end she gave us the wrong check was quickly fixed . The food was good, and the burger my mom had was one of the best burgers that we've had in a long time. Mine was good, it was nice and fresh, but nothing special it is REALLY huge though, and it's mostly stuffed with turkey . But the best part was the fries sweet potato fries. They were DELICIOUS. Anyways, we were satisfied and we're thinking of going back for breakfast some time.",2
"This review is for Great Arizona Picnic event of the Scottsdale Culinary Festival. n nThe foods here are pretty bland. Every other stalls sell plain tacos. The non tacos vendors are drinks and chain restaurants. The only good thing about this place is the people watching. Just think about this event as a baseball game. Instead of watching Red Sox Yankees, it's fashion show and the food is the same as ballpark foods. For excample, there is a vendor at GAP that sells Chili Dog or Plain Hot Dog, half size for 3, that's how bad it is. n nIf you want decent food, go somewhere else. If you just want ballpark food with beer and music then go here.",1
"The waitress behind the cash register deserves a raise for all of her amazing help and guidance during our visit, she was fantastic. The food was great and so was being able to dine outside and enjoy the weather!",2
Erin was in Charlotte today! 3 29 13 I was very lucky to be able to have a great 2 hour massage with her. Its never a good idea to go without a massage for as many months as I did but Erin is in great demand these days and with my wonky schedule getting together is nearly impossible. nBut yesterday the stars aligned and she was able to make some progress on my knot filled back. We did 2 hours of ashiatsu. It was painful but it was bliss. nArt of Massage has been doing some redecorating. I'm not quite sure what it is that they're trying to say with the new look of their ashiatsu room. When I entered it my immediate thought was how dark it was. It had an abstract piece of art on the wall and another of someone turned away from the viewer. Both pieces radiated darkness and coldness. There were heavy dark drapes that blocked out all of the light. Welcoming elements such as the salt lamp were gone and thet were replaced by a dark colored dresser with light blue handles. The handles looked luminescent in the low light. There is only a single table in the room. The room reminds me of one of those Internet puzzles where you try to escape the room by clicking on various elements. A new addition was an iPad on the top of the dresser. Clients check out via the iPad with their therapist in the rooms rather than out in the lobby. The waiting area outside AoM hasn't been updated yet.,2
"This place is HORRID, I was here for Valentines day 2010, we were seated and ordered drinks.20 minutes went by when the waiter finally came back to our table empty handed saying ""oh oops sorry I'll be right back with your drinks "".another 20 minutes go by.comes back with no drinks, he can see that I'm pretty pissed and finally returns 5 minutes later. n nNow I don't know how many of you know what a Vodka Collins is but it's a simple drink made with sour mix, sprite or tonic and vodka and comes in a tall glass. The waiter came back with a martini glass, filled with the worst pineapple martini I've ever tasted.what the hell? At this point I didn't complain because god knows how long it would have taken him to come back with another drink. n nThe food was awful, my soup tasted like lukewarm bathwater with fermented fish don't remember what it was and it has since been removed from the menu.thank god and the entr u00e9e wasn't much better, the lobster was insanely rubbery and I think I could have had more pleasure eating a doggy chew toy. n nOnly semi edible thing here was the desert, I had triple layer mouse cake and the cheese cake, those were alright but nothing spectacular. n nI love the JW Marriott but this place ruins it.",1
"Slow, boring food. Two stars because the staff were nice and the good didn't look like it would make me sick. There is no reason to come back.",1
"I will not be returning to this office. The doctor and exam were fine, however the opticians who dispense the glasses are awful. The first optician who fitted me with frames did not seem to know what she was doing. And when I picked my glasses up, I saw another person who just basically handed them to me. She did not fit them or check my vision. I was very surprised by that. My glasses were not done the way that I asked initially. I had requested light weight lenses since my RX is very strong, and I wanted the edges rolled and polished. When I got my glasses, the edges were not polished. I returned them a week later and then waited over a week to get them back. Once I started wearing them I realized how heavy they are. I can't wear them without a lot of discomfort. Also, one of the screws in the side was very long and stuck up visibly above the frame. I went back again about a week and a half later to see what could be done. The screw was stripped and they could not get it out. They filed it down and scratched the frame in the process. I am now told that I am stuck with these glasses because too much time has passed. I don't live close to this office so I can't just run right over. I feel that there should be some sort of guarantee, but there is not apparently so I am out a few hundred dollars. If you go here, be sure to ask what your options are if you are not happy.",1
"This Dick's used to have excellent customer service. I don't know what changed, but they don't any more. In fact, the people who work there are now kind of. n nOk, well, perhaps that joke is a little TOO obvious. n nSeriously, though. I don't care how much cool stuff you have or how awesome your sales are. If I ask you if you have a shoe in a certain size and you answer ""probably not "" and walk away without even looking at me, I won't be buying anything from your store. n nWell, I suppose this is why they invented Zappos.",1
"I've been there numerous times now, and I am always amazed at just how good the food is. Huge portions, wonderfully seasoned. I get the chicken barg soltani and it is amazing. It comes with rice and a salad or just rice if you prefer . We always start our meal with some tadiq with gheimeh bademjan. Making good tadiq is an art form, one which this place has mastered. The yogurt salad yogurt with cucumbers and mint is stand alone delicious, but I prefer to have it on my food. And for dessert try the Persian ice cream. n nIf you've never had Persian food you are missing out on some wonderful meals. There are numerous vegetarian dishes, also. Give this place a try you won't be disappointed.",2

"The Griffin asks very little of you. No dress code, no cover charge, no loan needed to buy a sloe gin fizz here. This is a welcome change from all the pretentious clubs on the Strip yes, I am talking to you Prive . Drinks were moderately priced and the music was supplied by a trusty juke box in the corner complete with all the latest hipster anthems . two fireplaces also make for cozy seating areas. n nWitnessed a little drama while there two emo boys argued, one was hurt and the other threw a glass poor didums , but other than that, a nice place to drink a few hours away.",2
"It was a bright and shinny afternoon when I strolled into the darken cavern that is Richardson's for an early dinner. With only 1 other table occupied, the waitress staunchly refused to seat me until my entire party arrives in this case, the 2 other people that would double the current occupancy level of the restaurant. n nI am getting an inkling that this may not be the pleasant dinning experience that I was hoping for. After 10 minutes of cooling my heels on the hot asphalt lot, my wayward friends arrived and we were granted permission to sit. n nThe menu had odd notes of randomness.Chicken Cordon Bleu.really? We ended up ordering New Mexico Sausages, Carne Asovada and the Relleno Platter. The sausages were the best of the lot. While the relleno was decent, it wasn't anything worth walking the hot parking lot for. As for the Carne Asovada, the flavoring was so subtle that we couldn't actually taste any.ended up asking for chile sauce. It took some effort to flag down the waitress since the occupancy level doubled yet again meaning there is now 10 customers in the restaurant .but finally, the waitress got us 2 house made sauces in tiny bowls. The sauces were okay and did improve the flavor the pork especially since it was completely bland before .but any remaining iota of good will from this better late than never gesture was completely banished when we got the bill and realized that we were charged for each of these 2 additional sauces. n nDid the so call cool quotient or the slightly above average food made up for the service? I don't think so. But hey if you're feeling masochistic and want to pay to be treated badly then head on over to Richardson. n nWould have given 3 stars for the food alone.",1
"I have been wanting to try out Intermezzo for a while now and finally had the opportunity. I must say that I was not sure what to order since many of their dishes have either beef or pork. n nBut after checking out some Yelp reviews, I decided to try the veggie lasagna. This was definitely a good choice! The lasgna was delicious and the portion size was just right not ginormous. I loved the fresh tasting tomato sauce and the veggies noodles were perfectly cooked. n nAfter seeing the reviews that mentioned dessert, I decided to splurge and try the crepes for dessert. The strawberries bananas in hazelnut chocolate sauce were so tasty! n nOn my visit the service was fast efficient. On.my way out, I walked by a table that had ordered pizza and it really looked good! I may have to try one of their pizzas on my next visit!",2
"Mr. Hess knows his stuff when it comes to Insurance.

Great person with great options! If you need insurance, then you need Rob!",2
"This place was great! We knew the owner from a previous restaurant he used to own and when he sold it, we stopped going. I'm so glad we found him again. nFood was authentic and greatly priced.

"Blech. Worst. French. Fries. Ever. n nFrozen, oversalted, pathetic potatoes who surely aspired to a better end than being served up here. n nHummos? How can such a delightful thing lack so much flavor? n nThe whole place tastes like cheap ingredients. n nIf you want Mediterranean food, there are far better choices in Vegas. Their old still current? location wasn't bad, though it seemed overpriced. n nTry Amena if you want similarly styled food with extra helpings of tasty!",1
"It's cold here, like anywhere indoors in Vegas. We came for a late lunch on Labor Day weekend, so it was still a little crowded even around 1pm, a 10 minute wait. But we got a nice table by the fountains and strip club, so it was pleasing for both parties. n nThe food seemed a little 'meh', to put it best. It was very run of the mill island bar fare. Basically their take on ""Hawaiian "" burgers is to put bacon or avocados on everything, with a slice of pineapple on the side. Last time I checked, that really doesn't have very much to do with the beautiful islands of Hawai'i at all. Neither does the Buffalo Burger, which we ordered. n nThe burger came out medium rare, which was nice. Although, my girlfriend did later complain about some stomach pains, which made it a tough day. n nThe prices here are going to be resort prices you can get better just by walking around in Vegas, and I suggest you do, unless you're absolutely set on eating at the Miracle Mile Shops.",1
Great food at first service seems speedy but then lags during serving but the good made up for it!,2
"I tend to stay away from buffets because, like Forrest Gump says, ""You never know what you gonna get. "" We had already eaten at two other Mirage restaurants during our weekend stay, so by process of elimination, we tried the buffet Cravings, which I kept calling 'Carvings'. LOL. Great quality wide variety fair pricing. I liked everything I had for brunch. A few items to highlight freshly made in plain view brick over pizza, freshly made on site gellato ice cream with a nice variety of toppings. Fresh, custom salads omelettes sundaes are made for you while you wait. n nThe one thing that could have satisfied me more was a better variety of sushi. They offered 5 basic options of sushi rolls on par with what you could get from the supermarket, BUT I won't hold that against them. n nI would definitely recommend Cravings I will definitely return.",2
"Question, who doesn't want to chow down on yummy Seattle Salmon Chowder? Answer, This girl! Of course being from Seattle, I have high expectations as to what a Salmon Chowder should be, and although this chowder didn't quite meet my standards, it could have been a lot worse! nMy salad was great though, and I got both the soup and salad in a combo for just 7.99 and it included bread and a chocolate covered strawberry! You can't beat that price! nThe Cherry Coke wasn't working but they made up for it with a syrup bar where you can flavor your soda with whatever flavor you want, so that made up for not having Cherry Coke. nThe resturant was also very clean and the staff very friendly!",2
"Charlotte's got a lot of great pizza places, but for my money, Libretto's is near the top.

"This is the closest thing to a New York bagel as you'll find in Phoenix. Proper consistency, texture, I dig em. They make a mean breakfast sandwich too. In addition, they have a bunch of the traditional NY deli fixins like Wise brand potato chips and Cheez Doodles, black and white cookies, Dr. Browns etc which is important to this transplant. n nNow, the bagels may be a little bit salty like many of the other posters have noted before, but you know what, beggars can't be choosers. And when it comes to finding quality NY style bagels in Phoenix, we beggars.",2
"Montreal really is a beautiful city. n nAs a native Bostonian, it's fun to go up to our northern frenchy neighbors and harrass enjoy everything they have to offer. n nI've been to this establishment, specifically the one on Crescent Ste Catherine, several times. nThe food is good and the beer is great. They get four stars for having insanely hot waitresses and bar tendresses. n nHonestly though, it's worth a try, at least, simply because they brew thier own beer in house and it's actually quite good especially the amber . I definitely recommend this to anyone!",2
I've had sno balls in New Orleans and it's exactly like my memory. Really rich flavors and great prices!,2
"Notes 1 visit, dinner nOverall Salty. Probably even more salty than Olive Garden, which is quite a feat. n nFree bread Best part of the meal! Soooo good. It's some sort of dark brown bread that's super soft and has a light honey flavor to it. I should have just eaten three baskets of that and saved us some cash. n nBaby back ribs Came with virtually no sauce. Dry and salty were the only two words that could possibly describe this horrible dish. The fries that came with it were soft and mushy. Ewww. n nCeasar salad Salty. The croutons and the chicken were good, but a salty salad is still a salty salad. Another reminder to always order dressing on the side at restaurants. n nCoconut shrimp Don't know if all coconut shrimp is like this, but I didn't like the coconut shreds. They were too tough and didn't add any flavor. n nShrimp on the Barbie Only decent dish that night, and I only say that because it wasn't too salty.",1

"Smithie's is a small pub located in the Cannonmills area of Edinburgh, and is frequented by a loyal group of friendly locals. I came here a few times as it is about 100 metres from where a few of my friends live. We came here to watch a few World Cup games and it seemed a pretty nice place. The d u00e9cor is pretty nice and is styled in the traditional British pub way. Drink prices are pretty good with a pint costing u00a32.75 and can be a good way of avoiding the price hikes you will find in nearby New Town. nThere is a good range of drinks available including real ales and malt whiskeys and they do sell food, although not proper meals. They do pies, toasties and hot dogs at pretty decent prices and these certainly complimented the beers we had whilst watching the football. nThe pub is pretty small however and during the football many people had to stand as there was not enough seats to go round. I will definitely be returning when I next go and see my friends in this part of town.",2
"Very good food. Pad Thai was very tasty and flavorful. Line was out the door on a Thursday. I ordered for pick up so I didn't have the chance to dine in. However, the place looked very welcoming inside with a large wine cellar in the front.",2

"If you're in Vegas and you need a sexy, dark place to enjoy fabulous drinks while enjoying a magnificent view of the strip this is your place, baby. n nIt's beautiful, quiet and the service is spectacular. They also give you some amazing almonds, wasabi nuts and mixed nuts to snack on while you're being blown away by the view. n nIt's very private. The tables are seated far enough apart so you don't feel like you're being eavesdropped on. It's a very romantic setup if you're looking for that sort of thing. n nThey have an extensive menu of mixed drinks that also come as mocktails. I am a beer drinker and they, in their exquisite taste, had Chimay. Yum. n nI love this bar and have since the first time I stepped foot in it. They are very accommodating if you don't have reservations, but I recommend them if you want window seating. n nVegas' perfect bar.",2
"Good sushi, especially for east mesa. Service is notoriously and consistently poor. 15min for water, 45min for any food, 5min for beer. These are standard tines, not based upon 1 visit. Sometimes you're not sure if you server completely forgot about you. Only reason we go is it is close, decent food, and really the best quality sushi near us that we've tried. Just realize the service will be bad if you go and don't expect greatness.",1
"This place was awesome! We are frequent visitors of Mexico and love everything about the country and this was the next best thing. We ordered the chips. carne asada burrito, carne asada taco, pollo asada taco, and a vegi loco papas. They were all SO good!

"The room was tiny, the pull down bed was uncomfortable, and the bathroom was also small. The door to the patio self locks when you're outside, and I got locked out at 3am. Dangerous and inconvenient! The night manager said it happens all the time. nFinally, on check out day, at 8.30 am, the front desk called up to ask if I wanted to take a survey. That added insult to injury after I'd spent hours of the night on the balcony locked out. nAfter reading other reviews, I think I got the small half of a suite which explaind only getting a pull down bed.",1

"I went here on the basis of the reviews on yelp, after all, it's never steered me wrong before! My friend and I went here to get pedicures and how I wish we wouldn't have. While the place seemed clean, it was dead for a weekend that should have been my first hint . Two guys did our pedicures. My friend got a basic color and I asked for a design from one of their pictures that were in the book on the table. Well my friends toes were cut in a ""u "" shape, dipping down in the middle and high on the sides she was so confused, had the guy ever given a pedicure before? My design looked anything like the picture and ended up looking more like jail stripes than the cute summer chevron I had asked for. When it was time to pay my bill was more than what the sign said, but I never received a breakdown, looking back I probably should have asked, but we were meeting my mom after and needed to go. nFlash forward, my second toe on each foot has been bothering me since the pedicure. saw a medical professional and they told me the place gave me a staff infection as well as an ingrown toenail. Y'all a STAFF INFECTION! I have been getting pedicures my whole life and never experienced anything like this. I'm new to the area and was just looking for a new place to get my nails did.

"Treated awfully today when arrived with daughter and wife for massages. Front desk guy doubled price when wife requested only head, neck and arm massage to 40, because it was ""custom massage "" . what a rip off. We told him that when we were there about 3 weeks ago, we got the introductory price, and he even called the massage therapist to the front desk to confirm it as if he didn't believe us . n nHe reluctantly agreed, but repeated at least 3 more times that the price should be 40. We told him he was unreasonable. The way I figure it, he was insisting to get the 40 per hour for the one person plus the 20 per hour for the other two, and based on his greed that he would not get the 60 I was willing to spend when we originally arrived. So, we told him that we were leaving . and his response was ""yes, you leave and don't come back "". The one item makes this experience all the more disdainful is that we phoned ahead of time to let them know that we were coming, and we wanted two foot massage and 1 head shoulder arm massage, and we were told ""ok, no problem, come by, see you soon "". n nWe won't be back. We won't make recommendations. We won't bring guests.

"I've now been to Parsley twice. I held off on doing a review after the first visit because I used a Restaurant.com coupon the first time I went. I wanted to go again to get the full on effect of paying full price and comparing the quality of food. Food always tends to be awesome when you're getting it for a lower price, so I definitely wanted to balance the two experiences. n nI was going to go full on 5 Stars after my first experience. The great reviews about this place are actually very accurate and I do not think the 5 stars are not warranted. But also of note, this is not really totally authentic Mediterranean food, but kind of a ""fast "" take on Mediterranean food. Since it is what it is, that is how I will grade it. With that being said, on to the food. n nFirst time I went I opted for the baguette option instead of a wrap. I purchased two a steak shwarma and a chicken shwarma. The chicken was for my husband, the steak for myself. I ordered the large, because hey, why not? I was using a coupon anyway. The quantity of meat extras you get is very good, and it is good quality. Personally I liked the chicken better than the steak. These two shwarmas made four meals. One for my husband, and three for me! I also ordered the French fries pretty good, nothing spectacular , and two cupcakes. Oh Em Gee were they good. The frosting was fluffy and the cake was perfect. Couldn't believe I got such amazing cupcakes at a Mediterranean place! Definitely grab one if you're in the mood for dessert, you won't regret it! n nNext experience today I went for lunch, to pick up something to take home for myself. I decided to go for a wrap steak shwarma, large. I figured I'd eat half and have the rest tomorrow for lunch. For me this go round I felt as though the steak was lacking something, I just can't place my finger on it. It had an almost bitter taste I couldn't get over as I ate it. I also disliked the wrap option, I should have gotten the baguette option again. I'm just not a fan of tortillas unless they're in burrito form I guess. Plus the white flour tortilla I got was very dusty of flour and it got all over my hands. Meh. n nOverall I would return to Parsley, especially since it isn't too far from my home. Next time I think I'd like to try a plate of shwarma instead of a wrap. This is a good spot for good food. Employees are nice, if maybe a bit brisk with customers during their peak times. Try out Parsley for sure, it's a good bet for shwarma at a decent price in a nice location.",2
"I was in Las Vegas for my first time celebrating a Bachelorette party on the weekend of May 6, 2011. At the time, I was in possession of a temporary license from the Georgia DMV because I had recently changed my last name. In addition I had a credit card and debit card in my new married last name that matched my temporary license. nThe Friday evening of our trip, I had no problem and was never questioned about my temporary license when we went to The Bank at the Bellagio. My group was on the list for Tao from No Worry Nights. To my surprise, when we went to TAO on Saturday night I was not allowed access because the head of security told me that my license was ""no good "". I find that incredibly surprising when I can get through airport security at Hartsfield International and it is ""good enough "" for a police officer in any state, but it is not ""good enough "" for access to a nightclub. While we were in line, a security guy or promoter made us group with a few guys, so that the guys could get in the club. The guys paid 200 in order to skip the line and get in with us. However, as soon as the guys got to the head of the line, they were told that it would be an extra 30 a person. Talk about BRIBERY AND EXTORTION! I had read about it happening at Tao on other websites, but I never thought I would see it first hand. I was appalled by the treatment of the patrons at this horrible excuse for a nightclub. The security would not even let me get my group that went into the night club before me! No amount of consideration whatsoever. It was overly evident that the treatment of clients is not important at this venue. So, I had someone behind me gather my group and we headed down to LAVO where they let us in with no hassle. And this LAVO is the same nightclub from the people who run TAO? Inconsistency in practices and policies is never a good sign to me.",1
"This is definitely not traditional, true Indian food. n nWe ordered Naan and received.pita bread warmed up and sliced in quarters. The nerve.to label something on the menu as Naan and then serve pita bread that looked like it just came out of a bag from Whole Foods. nAnd today they were out of chicken tikka.gasp, sigh. nThe chicken masala was bland, but the chicken curry was tasty but not noteworthy. The chickpea ceviche was good. nThe service was attentive and responsive. n nI would suggest to try it at lunchtime to save and try a few things to see if you might like it.",1

On a recent visit, I was very pleased with my spicy chicken rice entree, with generous portions of meat and plenty left over to take home for another meal gotta love that! . I also like the complementary bread and olive oil for dipping. My companion ordered a lamb dish which he much enjoyed. On a prior visit however, I ordered an item containing ground beef and vegetables wrapped in a puff pastry. It was dry and tasteless and I left very disappointed. I learned to steer clear of similar menu items. n nOverall, The Nile is an excellent choice for Mediterranean cuisine on the west side. With unique menu choices and prompt, attentive service, this place is hard to beat!",2
"Hi all! I am an avid runner, or a least was until a couple years ago when I was training for a marathon and got cartilage damage after excessive running. Anyways, I feel better now and wanted to get a nice pair of running shoes, which I had wanted to get back home in NJ. However, my fiance and I wanted to start running, so I gave this place a shot and went there to look for my shoes! Well, I have to say that I have never gotten this rudest of costumer service anywhere, specially when you are buying specialty product. I am baffled at how these people make any money being so rude. The shoes have no prices and when I was asked ""Can I help you with anything? "", my answer was ""Shoe Prices "" and the response was ""There are no shoe prices on the shoes! "". I can read, so I know that and this is why I was asking for these prices. The woman also made it sound like I didn't know what I was doing because I was in the man's section and I felt she also insinuated that I couldn't afford the 90 100 shoes. I am soooooo glad I am not from IL because I don't have to buy from these rude people, but if I ever have to come back here, I am sure to NEVER buy from this place and I suggest to all that you drive out to other locations and find friendlier staff. I actually suggest you check out Road Runner Sports if you have time before giving your money to this bitter place.",1
"fairly disappointing. we rented a car because we wanted to avoid a ""package tour "" and make a few stops along the way. little did we know that you actually have to PAY to get anywhere close to the edge of the canyon. we weren't interested in the skywalk, but if we had been it would have been an ADDITIONAL charge of 30 bucks per person. it just didn't seem worth it. i think we were also a little disillusioned by the fact that they had actually figured out a way to charge people to look at the grand canyon. i mean, seriously? we took a few photos from the parking lot and turned back, only to get a flat tire a few miles down the road. some sort of omen for complaining about the hualapai tribe charging money to look at a natural wonder? who knows. two stars for a scenic interesting drive through the joshua trees and surrounding desert. n nnote if you try to make this trek on your own and rent a car like we did, be sure you get an SUV collision insurance. the rental place conveniently failed to mention the 20 mile drive down a winding dirt road as well as the fact that any damage sustained to the car on an unpaved road is not covered. so use caution!",1
"Ahhh Lapperts Ice Cream. I remember flying into Honolulu International Airport back in 2004 and coming across Lapperts Ice Cream. I remember asking my boyfriend if we could stop by and try them out and he said, we would do it another time. We never got that opportunity. But I am not bitter because, Lappert's is in Vegas! If they were not in Vegas, I would so hold it against him. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Lappert's! They have a good variety of flavors, not typically found at your chain ice cream parlors such as Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone's. If you love Macadamia nuts, you will love Lappert's. Some of the flavors you will find here are Caramel Coco Macadamia, Coconut Macadamia, Banana Caramel Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia, Macadamia Nut ice cream, Chocolate Macadamia nut. Other flavors available include Kona Coffee, Kauai Pie, green tea. If you are boring, they also have the typical vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream. My favorites include the Banana Caramel Chocolate Chip and the Macadamia Nut. So uberly, yummy delicious! n nPrices are reasonable and portions are GENEROUS! Their one scoop is equivalent to almost 2 scoops from Baskin Robbins. Service is always great. If you are unsure of a flavor, don't be afraid to ask for a sample or two or three or four or five. They will hook you up! Not a problem! n nTip Hit up their neighbor across the way, Aloha Specialties first for delicious Hawaiian food, then stroll your way to Lappert's for dessert. I promise you will not be disappointed!",2
"Guacamole. That's all you need. That and margaritas. Boom. Good meal. But really both were delicious. The food was okay, nothing out of this world but I still enjoyed it. The bartenders were awesome and really entertaining to talk to. Good experience all around.",2
"Lunch is an outstanding deal! Two courses for 10 u00a3. The haggis balls had been recommended and they did not disappoint. The calamari was excellent perfect texture and flavor. We also had the salmon, ribeye, and mussels each of us were happy with our selection. The atmosphere is so nice and the waitstaff are terrific. Would go again for sure.",2
"I'd rate them zero if I could. My husband and I came here at 7 30 on a Friday night and the place was completely empty, we went inside where we stood at the counter, completely ignored by four employees who made eye contact with us, yet continued their personal conversations. They never acknowledged us. We were the ONLY people in there. After several minutes, we decided to leave since it was obvious they were not going to serve us. As we were leaving, I said, ""We were hoping to order I guess you didn't want our business. "" One of the employees shouted sarcastically, ""I'm sooooo sorry, "" and then proceeded to follow us out to our car being belligerent. No wonder this place is empty on a Friday night!",1

Mike was amazing ! Called him and within 30 we met at Starbucks and 10 minutes later my screen was fixed! Great service great price!,2
"On the plus side, the tempura, soups, salads and sashimi were quite good and decently fresh. n nThe big disappointment was the sushi, which was bland to the point of being inedible. The main problem is that the chef does not use proper, seasoned sushi rice, but instead uses plain white sticky rice, which is not the same thing. The result is very dry and flavourless. n nThey also shove way too much cucumber in their sushi and not enough of anything else. In addition, they put out very cheap soy sauce that is watery and not very flavourful. The service was also not amazing, and we had to ask twice for wasabi which should be served automatically with any sushi plate. n nOverall, if you can make a meal out of sashimi, tempura, and sides, this is not a terrible all you can eat deal. But for the actual sushi, better to stick to Kanda.",1
"I brought my car in on Thursday December 26th for an oil change and I had concerns that the engine was moving around and causing an exhaust leak. Rick asked if I could leave the vehicle I agreed planning to get the car later that day. I never received a call so I contacted the shop and told that my engine mounts were bad and the parts were ordered. They never mentioned that I could drive the car while parts were being shipped and told me I would ""definitely have my car back on Friday "". n nI was unable to work Friday and didn't hear from Rick or any other employees. When I called, I was given more excuses and told the car would not be ready until Saturday 12 28. I told Rick that I need the car by 2 00 so I could get to work, again I was assured that would not be a problem. n nSaturday I contacted the shop, reminding them that I needed the car by 2 00, they responded that they were still waiting for parts, they would do their best to have the car ready by 2 00 and they would call me. I was never called during my 3 day ordeal so I wasn't surprised not to hear from anyone. I arrived at the shop at 2 10 Saturday afternoon to find my car on the lift, nobody working on it, and Rick and another employee hanging out in the office drinking big gulps. n nThey scrambled away when I inquired about my car so I followed them into the bay where my car was sitting. I was told that the engine mounts were fine, but some bolts were loose, one had shearded off and I should be happy that I didn't have to pay 800. I was shown the special Chrysler bolts that had to be ordered but not installed. I was told to bring my car back when ""I had time to leave it "" so the bolts could be installed. The next day I took my car to another shop that repaired the bolts in 20 minutes. The mechanic said that whoever replaced the engine mounts previously didn't properly tighten the bolts. n nMy greatest concerns are the complete lack of communication, I felt like my car was being held hostage, and I felt like your employees were trying to cover up a mistake that they had previously made. n nAs I was driving away I had to call to make sure the oil had been changed because there wasn't a mileage sticker.",1

The concert for Great White was great.But you guys need to get your act together on how you serve your people.The line was a half hour long.under staffed.very very disorganized.,1
"I wish I could give Yama 3.75 stars. Yama used to be the ""go to "" place for sushi. Every time anyone mentioned sushi, Yama it was. Until the service started going downhill. Their food is pretty good. Their selection of special rolls is pretty unique. Their Palm Job is amazing! Their roll names are a bit amusing but you have to have a sense of humor. n nThe servers and sushi chefs are hit or miss. Sometimes your water is overflowing and sometimes your slurping the last drops of your melted ice for 10 minutes. Also, the sushi chefs have a horrible habit of ignoring you if they are in the middle of doing a service order, even if you stare right at them. Normally I am pretty patient when it comes to ordering at the bar, however a simple ""I'll be right with you "" would be plenty. n nOn the plus side, they have a great AYCE price, which more than pays for itself when you add up the individual roll prices. They also will make you half rolls too, which is my favorite. This way I can try a whole bunch of rolls without filling myself up. They do tend to cover their rolls in a good amount of sauce so if this turns you off, make sure to ask for it on the side. n nAll in all, I do go back to Yama, but not as often as I used to. Step up the service guys!",2
"Walmart doesn't change much from one location to the next, and that is really part of their appeal, such as it is. This location really isn't much different in that regard. n nWhere this location really falls down is the parking lot. Rather, leaving the parking lot. Getting into the lot is not difficult. Getting out is a nightmare. You can either leave by Independence and risk life and limb and car , or you can exit by residential street, and end up getting on Independence in another direction, or wind your way through other residential areas and end up who knows where. n nThere is, quite frankly, no way to get going in the correct direction if you want to end up headed in at least one particular direction. You cannot completely fault Walmart for this it is like they took some cues from casino designers here, and the city let them. They really need to close off the outbound exit direct to Independence and create a way to get onto Albemarle to make it really accessible. In the meantime. there are other locations that are way more convenient.",1
"The concept is great, Karma Pizza is good, nothing exceptional. Boba tea is not something I would recommend, I tried lychee with lychee jelly and it was watery and then I tried the milk tea and they has ran out of boba and offered rainbow jelly and I accepted. Such a horrible suggestion, rainbow jelly is tangy and acid and milk tea is sweet and creamy. It was huge and very expensive ",1
This was our go to place for breakfast.then reality TV stepped in. Went just after the change.was not impressed.the menu was not even close to the what it used to be.and the food was not that great either the eggs benedict had shaved ham.I didn't care for it.oh well. Went again because friends wanted to check it out they were picking up the check so I went along It was Mother's day and the place was dead. Went for the 3rd and last time yesterday because I found an unused Groupon.it was a Tuesday at about 11 30am there was one other table of 5 or 6. I had a California omlette it had sour cream on it that had a funky taste didn't eat that pushed it to the side of my plate.the hashbrowns tasted like they had been sitting around for some time.and the toast was cold. My daughter had the biscuits and gravy the meat in it tasted like hotdogs. Its too bad about this place because we used to enjoy going there for breakfast,1
"View 4 nFood 4 nService 1 nTea COLD n nI booked ahead of time and we were sat at a prime table right by the window so we could enjoy the view. A complete tea tea, sandwiches, scones and pastries runs 40 pp but.it includes all you can eat! Not that one intends to stuff oneself with scones, buts its nice to know that you can have another mini sandwich if you're still hungry. My sister tried the cupcake bento box and she liked it. My friend and I also tried some tea cocktails, pricy but good n nAll in all, the food was very tasty and the tea would have been good if the water was hot. It wasn't. Also, our server was very confused at all times and mixed up forgot many of our teas and tea cocktails. I was shocked to receive such poor service at a place like this. It seemed as though she had no idea what we ordered and who ordered what.the chaos was unsettling. Things arrived haphazardly and were piled on our table. I am not sure I would return, but I will miss the yummy ham and horseradish sandwiches. I do not think we got our money's work and I also hate when I actually feel bad for my server and neglect to make a simple request to make their life easier. That's how stressed out she was.",1
"Absolutely NO guest PARKING here! You are forced to Valet Park your car and if you stay too late, they move your car across town and you will never find it until the next day! be extremely careful when you patronize this establishment! Do Not hand your keys to anyone! You have been warned! But they do have good food!",1
"I find it sad that you can walk into a store and no associate will even make eye contact with you or say, hey, we'll be with you in a moment. I was just at the store and stood for about 10 minutes looking at phones thinking about switching from verizon and I understand that there are other customers, but some of them had two associates helping them. I just think someone could have broken away to say hello at the very least.",1
"My Wife and I decided to try this place a couple weeks ago. What a big mistake on our part. This place is terrible. The older woman who waited on us was very unfriendly and gave me the impression that she did not want to be there waiting on customers. My wife ordered a chicken entree and I ordered a pork dish. Both arrived semi warm. There seemed to be a party going on in the kitchen as the music was loud and not customer oriented. The waitress, after serving our dinners, stood against the front wall and did not return to our table until we moitioned for a check. Having eaten Japanese and Korean all over the world I would rate this place as bottom of the bottom. I don't think this place will last long.",1
"Given. The coffee is okay. Not amazing. But you'll get a solid cup of coffee HOWEVER the set up is awful. As a University of Pittsburgh student I like to head to coffee shops to relax and do homework. This place is not ""homey, "" nor a relaxing place to do homework. A coffee venue has more to do with just the products it sells, another key aspect is environment. The environment of this place gets a 0 out of 5. I have given them a star because of the cup of coffee that woke me up one morning.",1

"The good Food is amazing, I had the SWORD FISH TACOS DELICIOUS, drinks were not only very good but unique in the style they were made, the service was tip top, they have indoor outdoor seating. n nNot so good Be sure to make a reservation as this place can get packed, not a good spot for a date or intimate setting, the seating is terrible you might as well have dinner with the strangers next to you I promise they are that close.",2

"I haven't written one of these in about a year, but I had to get on here and give Roy's the respect it deserves for having easily the best service in Las Vegas. n nWe called last minute to get reservations on a Friday and offhandedly mentioned that we were part of a bachelor party. Upon arriving, our menues had special inserts on the front page congratulating the groom to be. When the appetizers came, they were followed by a complimentary champagne toast. The meal itself was great, and the mix of different price levels worked great for our diverse group. Some people got a few sushi rolls or appetizers for dinner while others went for full entrees. n nWhen someone from our group asked about splitting the check halfway through the meal, not only did our waiter do this, but he actually split the cost of single appetizers among the people who shared them. This was above and beyond, I wouldn't expect any restaurant to do this, and to be honest, if I was asked I would probably lie and say that the computers wouldn't allow it. n nOn our way out, the manager asked if we wanted a picture together and took one with his digital camera. Before we got into our cab, we had a printed picture in a cardboard photo frame. What an amazing experience. n nWe ate at Bouchon on this trip as well, but save a few dizzyingly great plates there, I'd have to say that Roy's was the best dining experience we had in Las Vegas.",2
"This hotel is ok but I been at better the room are nice but the bathroom is very very small if you have kids they only get showers you need a plug to take a bath .note if I was you bring extra TP they don't leave you extra when you run out that it,the hallway smells but the up side is the Hash House is a great place to eat Breakfast the pancakes as big as your head very good",1
"I love my Mexican food but I don't love overpriced Mexican food. n nRecently on a Vegas trip with some girl friends, we stayed at the Luxor. As we were still recovering from the night before, we decided to make dinner easy and just head downstairs to T T. I understand that we were on The Strip in Vegas but 13 before tax and tip for a chicken quesadilla is pretty ridiculous. There was nothing special about it and I only ate about half before I couldn't choke down any more cheese. n nThe chips and salsa were slightly better but I would have preferred a traditional red salsa instead of the green salsa and the chipotle I think? salsa. n nI'll save a few bucks and pass on T T in the future.",1
"Massive Japanese buffet. Big selection, affordable. Just not very good. n nThe miso soup is really bland and, I think a few times I had it, they ran out of the miso. So I just ended up getting warm water. The hot food ranges from bad to mediocre. The sushi I'm afraid of eating buffet sushi. I've heard of too many horror stories about people getting sick from it But, I hear that it's OK here. Nothing special. Maybe a little too much rice, but it's supposed to be fresh n nService is fast and efficient. I wouldn't say that the staff is friendly. But it's not rude. n nThe giant octopus sculpture thing is amazing though. 1 star for that alone.",1
"A while back, I was living in SLC, UT for 6 years. I slowly became a coffee drinker since the winter in SLC was pretty long and chilly I was introduced to this great coffee shop called, 'Salt Lake Roasting Co.' which is located in downtown area. I loved this place because of their cozy atmosphere and the great taste of coffee. I am very happy to find out that Sambalatte is opened in town My favorite aspect of Sambalatte is the atmosphere! Just like the one SLRC in SLC.The downstairs is a little bit bigger than the upstairs area loft style, big wooden table with a plenty of comfy chairs sofas, board games, books, magazines, new papers are available to use . There are various sizes of tables you can set up on free wi fi as well, awesome! nIf you are a espresso drinker, I recommend a 'Affogato with Vanilla Gelato' it's simply put, a shot of espresso with a scoop of your choice of gelato in it. I usually get a regular coffee Sumatra and it is divine! When I order my coffee, the barista pours water over the coffee bean grounds, stirring them, and pouring the water A hand drip coffee, yay P But more importantly, the service was out of this world. All the staff were friendly, nice, and helpful. They also provide you a drink card ask a barista before you pay . It is a great local coffee option if you want to do your work or hang out in a relaxed atmosphere. You don't get hassled or interrupted.",2
"The service here is always atrocious. The food has, over time, become quite mediocre and they regularly botch your order now. It's very noisy, and you will wait for at least an hour, even on weeknights. I ordered vegetarian rolls once and was served a roll with crab. A co diner sent something prepared incorrectly back, and they used the same piece of grilled tuna to remake the plate and brought it back cold. I have had it take so long to get drinks that all the ice had melted and watered it down by the time it got to the table. Best for lunch and if you sit at the bar.",1
"I'd been curious about this place for a while, because of the big, green Buddha mural on the outside, visible when you're walking down Mont Royal. We decided to go in for a dinner tonight and were not disappointed! n nThe vibe is great walk in and seat yourself, either at the counter overlooking the tidy kitchen, or at one of the traditional style settings where you remove your shoes and sit on mats at low tables. It reminded me a lot of my experiences of dining in Bali. Our server was extremely attentive and on the ball, and quite friendly without being obtrusive. n nWe chose to sit at the kitchen counter, which was actually really fun. We watched the kitchen staff prepare our meals with a little bit of showmanship, craftfully flinging vegetables into the two large woks. Everyone in the kitchen seemed to really like each other, too. n nThe wait time for our main dishes was really reasonable and the serving sizes were EXCELLENT value for the cost. I also asked about whether or not they use MSG in the food, and to my delight, they do not. Our food was served steaming hot and was very good. I ordered the Tampopo noodles, which come with shrimp and a black bean sauce, and there were tons of shrimp in my bowl, which was great! I'm used to restaurants skimping on the shrimp, but not these guys. n nI left with a very full belly and a good feeling about coming back again. They do delivery in the cute takeout boxes, too, so maybe next time I'll order in just for kicks.",2
"What's a 25 year old to do in a city built around Sun Devil spirit and keg parties? Mill Ave is at the heart of Tempe, and it had begun to feel like I had outgrown it. Then La Bocca moved in and my friends and I had a delicious place to go with a great Happy Hour that made us feel like we could still call Mill home. After a few successful years the great minds behind La Bocca opened Canteen.a tequila bar that brings something fresh and new to Mill. n nThe restaurant itself is MASSIVE, and the trendy decor adds a splash of color and class to the restaurant. In Arizona we count down the seconds until it is cool enough to enjoy a drink outside, and Canteen doesn't disappoint, with giant patios in the front and the back of the restaurant. Canteen has a great Happy Hour we got three drinks, chips guac and nine tacos for 30! , and the food is delicious. Servers were nice and friendly as well. n nI'm not giving Canteen 5 stars yet because it is still new and we had a number of service snafus that I'm sure are just a few kinks that still need to be worked out. Nothing worth ruining our dinner over at all. Overall, I'd definitely recommend Canteen for some great food, fun atmosphere, and one of the best Happy Hours on Mill.",2

"This review is for the casino itself , and it not that great ! I really wanted this place to be better after it's rebranding , but it's really gone down hill , I think they alienated their core customers , which are locals. after all we are the ones that keep this place in business after everyone goes home ! Whoever does their casino marketing really needs to be fired ! There really is no reason to gamble your hard earned money away anymore , other than to get comped at their crappy restaurants as it is , if you do wander into their restaurants for whatever reason the prices are pretty cheap to begin with, so dropping some cash into their machines is kind of a moot point ! Before there were point multipliers during the week which you really didn't mind dropping a 100 or so , because you were earning part of your money back in free play , points or could use them to buy beer , cigarettes or crap in the sorry ass gift shop ! But now the only point multipliers are on weekends , which as any local knows , you just stay away from the strip area if you can on fri, sat sun ! I play here out of habit , but like so many others I'm over it ! there are no familiar faces of my fellow locals anymore , it's basically just a rest stop for hookers and other malcontents during the week with the occasional tourist that got rooked into booking a room there! It used to have a fun vibe , but whoever is running the place now must have a no smile policy , because everyone that works there looks like they hate their job or are looking over their shoulder because they are afraid of getting fired or f king up ! I'll still go here every now and again , but for rewards and to drop some of my cash , I'm going over to a few of the other local haunts , where I feel my patronage is appreciated !",1
"Cheap tools galore. I have bought some power tools, hand tools, and even an air compressor from here. Everything's hit or miss. Some stuff works as well as the name brands and some stuff fall apart after a few uses. I would probably stay away from the more expensive machinery and any precision equipment I wouldn't use their torque wrench to rebuild my tranny, but I would use it for tires .",2
"Checked this place out tonight and was blown away by how incredible this place is. The drinks are unique and have a variety of rums to choose from rum is the only liquor they carry from what i understand. nThe food phenomenal as well. I ordered the avocado spring rolls, catch the day which was salmon , and the jerk pork. Each had a unique flavor. For dessert the chocolate creme brule was recommended to us and enjoyed every last bite. nService was excellent. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and gave excellent recommendations, as it was our first time. nI would highly recommend trying this place. Perfect for small groups or dates.",2
"Great selection of High quality meats, poultry, seafood, deli meats, etc. They also have fresh bones for dogs that mine absolutely adore! Love this place",2
I live close by so this is my gas station always reliable as far as gas prices go. They have friendly people. Now downside of this place is there's many homeless people hanging out or sleeping around. However if you don't mind homeless ppl coming up to you and asking for money and or to wash your windows then this is the place to fuel up. It's the cheapest I have seen in all of Phoenix even when comparing to chain still this location is the best price by almost 10 cents.,2
"It's Taco Time. Yeah, right!. Just letting you know right now, not my idea to come here. But it was a co workers time to pick lunch and he swears by this place. Why you ask? I even wanted to know. Well, this is the only Taco Time in Las Vegas and he grew up on this stuff back in Utah. Big deal.now let me eat. n nNothing on the menu was appealing to me, both taste wise and calorie wise. I ended up pulling up the myfitnesspal app and found something decent. I ended up getting their Crisp Chicken Burrito. I know, their known for their burritos. I just didn't want to indulge knowing that a big dinner was within a few hours. Their Crisp Chicken Burrito is basically a large deep fried taquito in my opinion. Tasted okay, but that's about it. n nAs for the ambiance.yeah right. This Taco Time is located at a truck stop off Blue Diamond across from from the Silverton Casino Hotel. When you're in here, you almost forget you're in Las Vegas. For a minute, I thought I was in Barstow or even Baker. Service wasn't the best and they didn't even have forks. Good gravy.I doubt I will stumble back in here.",1
"Very nice interior, good service, and tasty food. Quite a strong entry into the Montreal dining scene!",2
"This place has great sales pitches and good on customer service until you sign on the dotted line. After that it is all downhill from there! nThey have horrible customer service and are not willing to work with you or give any leway on returning the items. If you decide to rent something from them for an event make sure you only rent one because the items they will send don't match! Our event was on a Sunday so when we saw the items didn't match there was nothing we could do because they were closed. The company took no ownership or responsibility for this issue and didn't seem to care. nDo not recommend them at all! Besides, their prices are really not very good. We founf it cheaper to purchase a chocolate fountain than to rent one from them. Party City, sam's Club and Costco are all cheaper. Do not use this company.",1
"I've been here twice now. The first time, I ate in and had the pan fried noodle, which I was hoping would be like that of OB Noodle House in San Diego. But it wasn't quite the same. It will do as an Arizona substitute though. n nThe second time, I ordered to go. Orange shrimp. I couldn't decide between it and the Singapore Rice Noodle plate, but ended up going with Orange Shrimp. The sauce was pretty sweet, but the shrimp was crispy and not too spicy. The chow mein was decent too, but not many veggies. The Spring Rolls were pretty good nice and crispy. So my only complaint on this visit was the lack of veggies in the chow mein. n nMy order was ready quickly and the staff was nice. Another good spot nearby is Wang's Delight which is diagonal across the Ray McClintock intersection.",2
"Alright. Let's be real. n nThe selection is nothing spectacular. A few meats, some sides, sushi, dessert. n n98 sure the mashed potatoes were instant and marinara sauce was canned. The prime rib was dry as the damn desert. And wasn't all that great keep in mind I'm a Nebraska guy, pretty picky about my beef n nWaitress was nice. n nDecor outdated, which is to be expected in the older part of Vegas. But still. The ONLY reason it's getting two stars instead of one is because the waitress was sweet and attentive.",1
"After being stuck in the rural Midwest for two years where food options were extremely limited, this place was a nice find for lunch. n nGlad to have my Pakistani Indian Yelpie friend present to order as I had no idea what to do. We got chicken karahi, goat biryani, chicken tikka masala, and chickpeas with some naan to share. Food came out looking looking very homey and overall tasted very good. n nThe karahi was by far the best very tender and moist chicken that I mopped up with naan. Tikka Masala was also tasty and had a nice kick you can adjust spice levels . The rice goat ratio on the biryani was high and while I usually like goat, this was a bit gamey and dry. n nService was slow given there weren't many other diners at the restaurant. However, portions were huge and very reasonably priced. Total bill was 44 for 4 and we left stuffed with 4 full boxes of leftovers. n nI would come back for more karahi and to try some other dishes. Probably for dinner though as the food is pretty heavy for lunch.",2
"This place is a little dive y, and the hours are very Apache Junction they close at 9 00 on a Saturday?! , but the food is excellent and they deal with the seasonal crowds that enter AJ in January through April. n nThe Southwestern Burrito I think that's what it's called, the one with cactus in it is huge and tasty. The cornbread is heavenly. The margaritas are great.",2

"Although there is table service, Pancit Adobo has a large buffet from which the server scoops out the orders. They look interesting and tempting on the buffet with a large selection of mostly fried foods. n nMy family is well versed in many different types of ethnic foods and we are always ready to try new things. We are absolute novices when it comes to Filipino food and I would have appreciated a bit more guidance when ordering at this restaurant. We ordered about five dishes, some of which I am sorry to say I don't remember. The pancit was good as was the Beef Adobo, but some of the other dishes we ordered we found inedible might have been from an admitted lack of Filipino ordering savvy on our part . We got a squid dish that was soggy, squishy and very fishy. Perhaps it is supposed to be that way? We normally love squid in a variety of recipes, but we found this disgusting. Untouched, save the small taste each of us spit out, the server never asked if she could perhaps replace the order with something else. Although friendly, she didn't bother to ask if we liked our food. n nWORST of all was the SMALL ROACH that scampered across my daughter's booth seat which we had to sweep to the floor and stamp on. This was done while the waitress was in front of us, delivering our food. She scarcely acknowledged it and did not even apologize. n nWe will not return.",1
"Holstein's is a solid upscale burger joint. The food is dependably good. The shoe string fries are crispy. The cartoon cows on the wall all dream about getting eaten. That's fun and quirky. n nNote The hotel brochure tries to market this place as organic and natural. The only hint in the menu was that one ingredient of the salad was organic. If the beef were organic and free range, I'd come back.",2

"ack. cant give it more than two stars. the poor staff was overworked, and that impeded my ability to order, out of common courtesy. we sat at the bar, and the sushi chef had to handle orders from five people at the bar AND orders from the restaurant. it just made it uncomfortable to keep ordering. for once, i left an ayce sushi place feeling just okay full. n nthey also did not have uni for the day and declined to offer an extra order of sweet shrimp per person. was def looking forward to uni. n nthe fish is fresh but sliced a bit thin. quality is decent. hotate was topped off with yuzu which was excellent. n nhandrolls seem like a good deal, as the specialty rolls had too high a ratio of rice to fish.",1
They have new owners and a new menu. All of the sushi chefs are new too. The new menu is good. There are only so many rolls you can make. It pretty much comes down to how fresh the product is and how clean the place is. I would recommend you try this place.,2
"AHHHHHHHHHH! Someone please call Bobby Flay! n nThe food here was not so great. I've never tried tex mex food, but from this experience I don't think I will ever try tex mex again. The restaurant is not at all fancy, but the minute my brother stepped in he was asked to take off his fedora hat. Come on, its not a baseball cap! n n FOOD n They start you off with a basket of bread and this is probably the best thing in the restaurant sad to say . The jalapeno and the blue berry bread were quite interesting and delicious. n I ordered the shrimp tamale and it was mediocre. I've had better. n The Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich was not the best. The bread was quite hard so I couldn't enjoy the sandwich. n The flavor of the Spicy Chicken Sweet Potato Hash was pretty over bearing in flavor. n The chicken salad was blah. The chicken was dry and nothing was great about it. n nOverall, mesa grill you have disappointed me and you will definitely not see me again. You would think the restaurant being owned by an iron chief would be good, but I guess not.",1
This place is HORRIBLE! Ive gone in here a few times and every experience is worse than the last. The food is mediocre and always cooked incorrectly. But what always gets me is how absolutely RUDE the waitresses are. I don't know where they find them but they are the worst surly human beings i have ever had to interact with at a restaurant. I could not help but give this place a 1 star because of how horrible I was treated and talked to in there. I will NEVER go back for the rest of my life.,1
"Tired? Haven't slept? Hangover? This is the place you want to be. In a city filled with mountainous buffets and chef endorsed eateries, sometimes what you really need is a place that serves hearty, down to earth grub. And that is pretty much what you get at Hash House a Go Go. n nI had the fried chicken benedict and it was a monsterous plate of fried goodness. At first, I noticed a huge load of mashed potatoes underneath everything else which made me a little cautious didn't want to food coma before going on the 5 hour drive back to LA . But surprisingly, the mash was rather light and went really really well with the rest of the dish. My chicken was cooked and fried perfectly with just enough batter for a nice little crunch. The bacon was a nice touch and the sauce they used brought the entire dish together. Overall, the flavors were very harmonious but truthfully, the most amazing aspect is the power of this meal to cure hangovers aggravated stomachs. Be it a night of cavalier partying or a low key drink fest, the food here will do more than enough to stop the room from spinning. n nJust be ready to wait a bit and make sure all of your party is present when you put your name down because they won't give you a buzzer until everyone is there. There will definitely be a wait but they have a selection of magazines for you to dive into, assuming you're in a state to read. n nI will say that our waiter was rather rude at times and didn't seem too keen on earning his tip that day. One of my friends was very hungover and in obvious discomfort but the waiter still seemed to think it was necessary to poke constant fun at him obviously he was joking I hope but there's a point where jokes get old and the waiter needs to learn when to stop. Maybe he realized we were getting annoyed because he disappeared for a while and left us to tend to our empty glasses of ice. I don't think it's enough to justify docking any stars but it's worth mentioning. n nJust be ready to come hungry and leave bloated.

"If any venue is in need of an extreme makeover, it's this place. Located in the same plaza as Lotus of Siam, this place is a dump and that's an understatement. They don't even try to make it look decent. There's broken crap everywhere, ranging from destroyed pieces of drywall, broken tables, chairs, insulation scattered about. it's a fucking mess. n nThe reason I stopped by was to see a friend perform in a WWE style pro wrestling match for the Adrenaline Unleashed group http www.adrenaline unleashed.com . The event itself was lots of fun, plus it was cheap only about 5 per person. It makes you appreciate the hard work, dedication, and precision of the performers in the WWE. No, really, I mean that. It looks dangerous and you'd never catch me doing that. I'd give the wrestling match good marks, but the venue. no way. The venue sucks.",1
"Upon entering with our bags, we were bombarded with hotel staff ""salesman "" asking us where lived, how long we've lived together, etc. I didn't answer and they were asking just to try and sell us on stuff.

"I initially thought it was good but maybe not great when I first tried it but found myself going back and trying the pork instead of the beef and that is when I connected with this place. They cook the pork in a one of those rotating gyro meat cookers with a whole pineapple on top, with the outer skin removed so the pineapple juice continually bastes the outer layer of meat as it cooks. I had the burrito with pork and that was great and then.I tried the torta, that lovely Mexican sandwich. It was on this great, fresh, soft torta bread with a layer of guacamole, not to thick, and then a layer of pork, enough to provide a taste, but not too thick. I loved it! I also like their mexican corn, though it is a bit messy and I have only had it once, since you eat it right off the cob, sprinkled with white queso cheese. n nSo, a reliable place for a quick lunch. The prices seem a bit high for what they offer but.I keep coming back so they must be reasonable. I think that basically they are more of a quality than a quantity place, which is a nice thing to see in a place essentially offering fast food but not junk food like at many corporate fast food joints . Try it out, I don't think you will be dissapointed. ",2

"Came in on a Saturday night. The new restaurant makes you forget that it was ever a Ruth's Chris. The staff was kind and when we complained about the cold, they adjusted the temperature and checked in on us. The place is spendy, and you will spend more than at CPH. The cocktails are about 12 14 and listed more Absinthe and Pernod than I had seen in a while. The Manhatten while served in a martini glass so that it looks itty bitty has enough alcohol in it to fell a buffalo. nThe appetizers include riblets and a wonderful avocado filled with goat cheese and roasted garlic. Not something I see everywhere and delicious. Had the octopus salad which was good but not memorable, mostly octopus, grapefruit, mizuna and fennel bulb and the classic chop which you can get at CPH and Cowboy Ciao. But that salad is so good I find myself trying not to eat directly from the shared bowl. The filet, scallops and ribs were all a hit. The one miss was the meatloaf. Was expecting it to be really homely and comforting, but found that one a bit dry. Overall, will be coming back. It's nice to have another fun restaurant option on the C.Corridor.

"They used to be delicious. I live right around the corner, and our family would eat there all the time when we wanted a quick dinner and didn't want to have to make it at home. The last two times I have been there though, it has been horrible. The service is horrible, the people are rude, and I actually got sick the last two times I ate there. The first time I got sick I didn't realize it was the food. I thought I just had a stomach bug and it wasn't nearly as bad as the second time I got sick. The very next time after that I got very sick again. It was one of the worst food poisoning I've had since I was a kid. There also seems to be a foul smell inside, a mixture between them not cleaning out their grease traps properly, raw sewage, and a dirty restaurant with mildew floors. As far as the rude service goes, my friend and I were ordering take out a while back, and my buddy thought he had paid the whole balance, but apparently he was off by 10 dollars which was purely accident. The lady in the front started yelling at us and freaking out, acting like we were robbing her or something and like we did it on purpose. Shouldn't treat customers this way, and if you value your health I strongly suggest staying away this place.",1

First off don't come here alone. Portions are for 2 or more and the menu doesn't offer more than one item and rice so it would be too much for one person to order 2 items. I ordered the Orange chicken because its a dish that is hard to screw up. Well despite the place being fairly empty and several staff on hand it seemed an eternity before any one took my order. Once my food arrived I dug in only to find the chicken flavorless with barely a hint of orange. It tasted more like sweet and sour sauce of the grocery store variety. I ate 1 5 the plate a decided I could do better at home with a packet of spicy seafood ramen. In the time it has taken for the wait staff to notice that I had given up on their tasteless dish to the time I received the cheque has been an eternity. I will never eat here again and I recommend that you don't waste you time or money. There is a plaque at the front door that claims best of Phoenix. I doubt they would win that award today.,1

"My husband and I had stopped by for a drink and appetizer last weekend. I have always heard about it, so this was my first time. The atmosphere was very relax, I wish my husband was not sporting a NASCAR t shirt. We sat in a comfy booth and with the candles all around I said this is kind of romantic. We had some chips and I got guacamole, we shared a quesdilla and my husband is an enchilada lover so we ordered a platter of those as well. Needless to say our eyes were bigger than our bellies and we took leftovers home. The quesadilla was very good, little bit of a kick but not too spicy. My husband enjoyed his enchiladas and ate the leftovers the next day. The whole drive from work all I could think about was finishing up the guacamole and was not happy when I saw he consumed before I got home! Looks like we'll have to go back! A must if you live in Ahwatukee and if you are planning a bridal shower or rehersal dinner they have a great back room that would seat 20 25 people very nicely, and its private too which makes it nice!

I have always enjoyed my stay at the Flamingo. n nIt's a bit old but the rooms were upgraded and they been working to make the place look better.

The gift basket was a nice touch from the casino host. n nThe show room is a bit small also but no complaints. The pool is one of the nicer one in my opinion n nI have good luck here.,2
"Pullman is a haven for wine lovers, whether just learning about wine or connoisseur. They have a great selection of carefully chosen bottles and also offer a nice variety of wines by the glass. You can also try a flight of wine that allows you to compare and contrast small glasses 2 oz of three wines according to a certain theme. The tapas make a tasty snack to go with your wine they're better for snacking than for a full meal . The atmosphere is trendy yet comfortable, and the chandelier made out of wine glasses is a beautiful centerpiece to the space. It's a good place for a date. n nI was there recently and tried a flight of Cabernet Franc, all from different parts of the Loire. Those were some interesting reds. For dessert, we tried something rare and unusual Macvin du Jura. Wines from the French wine region Jura are unusual enough anyway, but this one was pretty special a late harvest wine that's been fortified. I was excited about the chance to try it. We also tried the cheese plate, which was well presented with each cheese served with some kind of fruit spread or nut that matched the cheese well. The olives were huge and took some work to get through. Next time, I would skip the curry hummus with vegetables. I guess I was looking for a heartier, more traditional hummus. My partner enjoyed the bison burgers. But go for the wine, not the food, and take the chance to try something different!",2

I ordered an Asian salad originally but it was the worse salad I've tasted it had no flavor, and loads of raw cabbage with chicken that was supposed to be marinated in sake? Tasted like processed deli lunch meat. Reordered the teriyaki chicken and it was dry and flavorless as well. Coworker ordered chicken curry katsu, salt overload. And another ordered Korean style ribs . That was good we all shared it being that own meals were unsatisfying. Too many other good sushi spots to pay the outrageous prices here. Go elsewhere.

Pretty much anything you could think of to put on top of yogurt you can find here. n nI had heard about the smiles program how cute but wasn't offered it before checkout and so just passed all together, knowing I would probably be back anyway. Foul on the checkout person! Tell me before! n nOutside of that, I loved it. Biggest drawback they have for this location is that I'm not sure if it's just this particular day I was there but there is a dumpster around the back where the additional parking is and it stunk so bad I had to resist gagging.yes that bad. Not something I want to smell before eating anyway. Hopefully next time I go it won't be that way. n nThis is a great little Sunday treat!",2
"I visited this location a couple weeks ago with some friends, since I had heard good things about RA. My initial impression of the place was pretty good. I liked the decor of the restaurant, and the loud atmosphere is what I was looking for I mean, Mill Ave on a Friday night.seriously . n nAs far as the service goes, it was decent. I wasn't impressed with the waiter, but I wasn't thrown into a fit of rage either. So, you know, props. With how busy it was, I wasn't expecting the world's best wait staff anyway. n nAnd then there's the food. One friend and I had various pieces of sushi, which were extremely average. Like, if you could grade this sushi with a C, it would be the largest possible C you could give. And for the high price point, this is really a turn off. My other friend had some kind of mushroom based soup that was pretty fantastic, though. I regret not buying cauldrons full of the soup.",1
"This review is for the shot clinic they had in May, 2013. I have been to several shot clinics and have been in and out in an hour or so when I was at the back of the line. Here I was the 6th person in line, and waited about 2 hours. The vet was so slow. He would spend 20 30 minutes with a dog. It was crazy. This is a shot clinic, intended to just get in and out. If you want to have a regular vet visit, go to your vet. I don't have time for this with a toddler running around. I just need my dogs to get shots. We then had blood drawn, and waited another 20 minutes to get the results the test took 5 minutes This shot clinic wasted my whole saturday. I was not happy.",1
"Las Vegas is a town that loves its lingerie not only are there several Victoria's Secret and Frederick's of Hollywood stores here, but also La Perla, Wolford, Agent Provacateur, and many impressive independents, from Love Jones at the Hard Rock Hotel to Strings, one of the most impressive ""showgirl supply "" stores on Arville . n nBut none of them tops the new Kiki de Montparnasse at Crystals in City Center. This may be the sexiest store on the planet every piece here is not only sexy, it tells a story. And it isn't just lingerie here, but all kinds of objects and accessories to suggest scenes. The back room bed is a stage worthy of any seduction. There are also many toys, from artful phalli to tie up tape. n nHaving said all that, you'll likely be browsing more than you buy here, unless you are the type who has an American Express black card.my shopping companion's comment that a ""wifebeater "" shirt with attached garter suspenders dead sexy, I grant you ""seemed reasonable "" at 150 kind of says it all.",2
Loved my pedicure here! They took they time and I didn't feel rushed like I sometimes do at other salons. Polish and heels came out beautiful! I will definitely be going back to this salon.,2
"Went there with my son after a round of Golf. The beer was reasonably priced, we split and tasty order of wings and had a Cobb Salad that was amazingly good for bar food. We sat at the bar and found the others in the room friendly and generally enjoying themselves. The free peanuts are a nice touch. This place is an oasis of down to earth people in the otherwise superficial world of Scottsdale. I will be back.",2
I am having a bad experience with them. I feel .like they have stolen my money and abused my trust. So my story is that I only wanted a few sessions of laser and therefore no contract and they gave me their session by session prices. n nAfter a few month I realized that my account is getting charged every month and not just for the two sessions i went in . I called a couple of times. First time they told me that there has been a mistake apologized and said im going to be refunded in 24 to 48 hours. When I was not refunded I called back again and this time the representative said we charge you every month unless you call us and ask us to cancel ! The funny part is they didn't even call me to book a session for me they just charged me. A company that steals from you does not even deserve 1 star.,1
Have gone to happy hour here several times and have to say that the bar staff and food are excellent. The fresh mozzarella is made to order at your table and definitely wortwhile.,2
"K, dont get mad at me cuz i am only giving 4 stars! I have yet to try out the dinner night life of this place. n nI went in with a book and laptop in the afternoon and ended up staying for 3 hours.yeah im a nerd. Their espressois amazing, nice and strong with a dark roast, i am guessing italian or even darker. They are working on training all of their workers on doing the cool designs on the lattes, but i could care less about that and more about quality. They are the only AZ bar to serve nutella mochas.omg amazing! Why hasn't anyone else thought of this? n nThis is a very small location, in an odd part of town. I am sure their lease is dirt cheap, but that allows them to provide amazing quality dishes at a good price! They have free wifi set up, so come in the morning or afternoons and hang out! n nI tweeted asking my friends if they wanted to go, and 32shea responded, 'come try us out, we have good drinks, great food and our staff is really cute! "" AND the staff is CUTE! n nI plan on testing our thier dinner and night life laterz!",2
"Worst cafe rio I've ever been to. Consistently out of something. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that they've had everything I've asked for. The food quality is good with the missing ingredients aside. n nThe customer service is also atrocious. The first time I got attitude I wrote it off as the girl having a bad day, but it's consistently that way. n nIf there was another one close to my house I would never go to this cafe rio.",1
"This was my first experience having ""dim sum "" and it was great! I usually don't take chances with new lunch places over an initial business meeting, so I was skeptical to start. However, after the first bite.wow! I highly recommend and will return when I visit Las Vegas again.",2
"Al's is no more. He has apparently sold both locations. This one is now something like ""Taste of Chicago "". Had a Chicago dog there and it was OK, but the place has lost its charm. Al, I hope you're doing OK and weren't a victim of the recession.",1
"Went for an early dinner in a party of 6 including one toddler. All of the adult meals were cooked well and served properly. The children's chicken fingers meal was bizarre way too much dough and very greasy. My daughter didn't like it and frankly I didn't want her to eat it. n nThat said, I eat the seared tuna dish at Baton Rouge restaurants regularly around the country, and this experience was as good as any. n nServer was not a very good communicator but it wasn't the end of the world. n nI will return, no problem.",2
"We've been to Serendipity several times overall, I am a fan of it. The portions are a good size to share with others, the pricing isn't too bad when you share on your own it can be spendy but what place isn't on the strip? the food is of great quality. My favorites include the Frozen Hot Chocolate all varieties had are yummy! , the macaroni cheese, the salmon, the spaghetti the best dessert the deep fried oreos. Soooo, so good.",2
"Disappointed with sloppy billing department, poor error correction n nI had a procedure done in January of 2014. It was incorrectly coded as ""infertility "" leading my insurance company to deny it. When i called AZ Tech Radiology asking them to resubmit the claim with corrected coding, I thought the matter was fixed. n nThen.two months later, I found that my bill had been submitted to collections for my failure to pay it. This is a huge hassle for me, and it was based on THEIR initial error.",1
"Do not eat here. Although they were very nice on the phone and the food arrived quickly, the quality was VERY bad.",1
To me yama sushi is the best ayce and its a lot affordable compared to others ayce I don't mind the wait tried the halibut sushi the happy rainbow and no name you cannot be dissapointed if you love sushi you'll understand what I mean,2
" WARNING BAD CONTRACTOR n nNot only is Marco the worst contractor I have ever dealt with, he also kept trying getting more money for everything we had already agreed on. He was unprofessional, incompitent, constantly late or no showing and tried to blame me for everthing he screwed up. n nThe whole job was completed and looked like hell. The bricks were just laid on the ground instead of cemented in so they were uneven, loose and sinking into yard. The sod had sat in rolls for 6 days so you can imagine how that looked. The yard was a bog because he didn't level and grade it correctly. And to top it off he damaged my house and brick walls with his bobcat. n nAfter I saw how poorly the job was done I threatened to file a claim against his bond with the Register of Contractors and he came over pounding on my door. He literally told me that if I wanted the job done right I should have paid him more needless to say I lost it. After a heated exchange I wrote an amended contract for all the things he would need to fix and he signed it. n nHe had his Mesa crew chief come out and in one day with a full crew and they fixed his terrible job. This guy was good on his word and the backyard is. acceptable. The rocks are still not evenly spread but by this point I just wanted them gone. A job that should have taken 2 3 days had taken over 2 weeks and a good portion of my sanity. n nWord to the wise. DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY.",1
"I read what seemed to be mostly positive reviews on this restaurant that has been at Desert Ridge long enough to be established. I'll start with the positives. the sweet potato fries were good and the water was wet and cold. The ribs, while okay, were cooked sans sauce, per restaurant standard, but not with the sauce we asked for on them. The 8 pulled pork sandwich was terrible, again sans sauce. The Ruben's pastrami was inedible and my wife's Mandarin Chicken salad was very mediocre. She likes very dry chicken, and this was TOO dry for her. We happened to dine there at the same time as some friends. They too were first timers, who vowed to never return. To end on a positive, the staff was generally friendly and service was fine. I left the restaurant smelling like I just came back from a camping trip.",1
"We have a feeling the ""Hollywood "" theme is definitely more up to date and appropriate in the US than the Arabic theme right now. Such are the realities in the seventh year of the second millennium. The new facelift seems promising. Good vibe overall, in spite of the mess outside and the incomplete transition from Alladin's badly interpreted Arab kitsch to a Hollywood bling bling kitsch. Can't wait to see the final result in a few months. n nRooms are clean overall, and have no heavy stench that is otherwise typical for most hotels on the South Strip. Bathrooms are nice too. Separate toilet, shower and a good size 2 person bath tub that comes handy to relax two tired bodies that have been slaving out badly during the heavy workweek back in LA. n nHowever, we did found some ""artefacts "" from previous visitors a few long thick black hairs, clearly from an Asian woman . sigh. Nothing is perfect. So we lowered the star rating to 4 for that reason. So far this is the only thing that disturbed our trip. But hey, we are still here we never know what else can go wrong. right?",2
"Ok I give the park 3 stars but 1 star for the surf hour it's a bummer because of the locals that go there. The guy that runs the surf shop is a d bag. Me and my buddy were sharing my board so I would wait in line till there session was done and then he would bring the board to me and vice versa. So I waited in line my buddy brings my board to me and mr surf shop says I need to go to the back of the line if I'm sharing a board and wait. I just waited I told him and I'm not going to the back of the line, he said its a rule. I asked who's rule? He said its an unspoken rule the regulars made. Kiss my. I just waited and you want me to wait again just cause I'm sharing a board what kind of bs is that I paid money to ride just like everyone else. If you want to have fun don't surf here, not worth the wait or the bs or the 3 second ride or the money.",1
"The only reason I come here.it's closer to me than the one in Tempe. n nOtherwise, I would recommend the Tempe BE. The quality of clothes are better the prices are better. I actually see no name brand shirts with tags from Ross priced at like 14. Umm, I'd rather go to Ross and pay 7 for the shirt. The jean prices are a little higher here as well. And less sale items.",1
"Yoga Hive is my favorite studio in PGH. I love the comfortable atmosphere, the energetic teachers and the friendly community. My first entry to the Hive was their awesome 10 2 week first timer grand opening special. I got to try out the different teachers and style of classes. I love their asana classes which span from Beginner Intro classes, calm ""Strong and Steady "", to more invigorating Power Yoga. I'm also a huge fan of the meditation and sound healing classes as well as the Full Moon Gong Meditations. n nCheers to Kimberly for being an inspiring yoga teacher and cheers to PGH for being lucky enough to host this great studio.",2
"After all the hype this was an overpriced disappointment. I orderd the griddlecakes with milk and coffee to drink. I also ordered a side of bacon as several reviewers recommended it. Including tax but not tip my total for breakfast was 16.01. n nThe pancakes tasted like Bisquik and the bacon was crispy black and looked and tasted like the cheap grocery store bacon you buy in the shrink wrap packages. Even funnier the ""three pieces "" were actuallly only 1 2 pieces of bacon at around 4 "" long. Overall I've had much better breakfasts at The Good Egg and First Watch at a lower price. n nAnother disappointment was waiting for me in the parking lot. An employee had parked her white Volvo behind my car and blocked me in. I first waited for her to finish unloading the car, assuming she would move the car after she was done. Instead she came out once more, closed the the trunk and went back inside. I had to go back inside and ask her to move. The employee did finally move her car but she didn't bother to apologize.",1
"Arrived here at 6 30 AM on Sunday morning. n nIt was depressing. The patrons and some of the staff just made me sad. n nI won't get into details, but it was soul crushing. It put me off my feed and I had to leave. n nIf they had legal gambling and the bars were open 24 7 in my hometown, I'm sure there would be plenty of depressing bars as well. n nI'll be back during the day to try the food just couldn't do it on this trip. n nDon't come here during the graveyard shift.just don't",1
"Celebrated a family member's birthday here last night. A place she's been wanting to try for a while and I'd never heard of before. Our party consisted of 20 people and I must say we all could not have had a better time. The food was great I tried the Pollo Rico and my wife had the Mesquite Tacos excellent!. What gets the 5th star is our amazing waitress, Charlene. Even with our large party she was attentive and managed to keep our drinks full and she got our orders out quickly and took very good care of us until our party ended and this, on a very busy Saturday night. We will definitely be back and highly recommend Nando's!",2
"So lovely to visit this airport! I adore the huge open center with huge windows in the middle of the terminals that you will most likely see if you are hitting a connection but you will see it quickly and at an interesting speed! n nI love the white rocking chairs, they remind me of being in the Philadelphia Airport. Also, we NEED to talk about the bathrooms.they have bathroom attendants here. WHAT?!?! I felt like I was at the really nice nightclub of airports. I was confused when she was there with mints and hairspray askin ""Hey Darlin, how is your trip going? "" UMMMM AND YOU ARE A Sweetheart? So lovely! Love this touch. It was a nice addition to the very clean bathrooms and airport overall. n nI have only been through this airport quickly so I hope my next layover is a little longer so that I can walk around instead of literally running through. However, be careful of what you wish for watch next time I will get stuck crosses fingers n nI really do wish all airports were as lovely.i mean why wouldn't you create a nice structure if you know everyone from all over the world are going to be frequenting it?!? Common sense to me if you ask.",2
Service was ok but not inviting. The country fried steak was terrible. We also has the BLT sandwich which was good. The fries and hash browns were plain. They have a cheap lunch menu but I will not return to try it.,1
"Southern hospitality? Yes ma'am or Mister n nThe first thing that struck me was that my server had a lovely accent. nMy daughter looked at me asked me if it was part of her job to fake an accent, I went with no. I'm not sure where it's from, but it's a 'honey y'all' accent D She had a very friendly disposition made our lunch experience a pleasure. She made her mama proud. n nThe food was decent AND you can have breakfast all day. I love having breakfast for dinner, so that's a big selling point to me n nThe building is fairly new, not too brightly lit clean. n nIn all honesty I would have given them an A OK rating, 3 stars, but our server pushed them to a 'yay! I'm a fan', 4 star rating. nGood people make the difference!",2
"Never again. I should have known not to stray from Thai taste, but I figured if give them a shot since I live between the two. First of all, they took my order over the phone and I had to call them back to give them my payment and spice level. They arrived with the food pretty fast, so I was willing to forgive the initial interaction. My boyfriend said it seemed light for what we ordered. We opened the bag and a LIVE BUG crawled out of the bag! The we realized they had forgotten half of our order, not that we had an appetite after the bug. After not being able to reach them by phone, we jumped in the car and sped off to take to food back and get our money back. They were closed and unreachable. The food now sits in my car waiting to go back to its home tomorrow. Yuck, gross, ew.",1
"I had the shrimp tacos, my niece had the El Green Go Burrito. They charge for chips and salsa. and for me anyone who charges for chips and salsa is lame. I'm from houston and we have the best mexican texmex food around, so as far as the food goes its just 2 stars for me. n nThe shrimp tacos were good, but just ok. same with the rice and beans. I've had better. Too many other great food places in vegas to spend money here. My niece said her food was good, but also mediocre. probably wouldn't be a repeat for me. n nThe staff was very nice. that was probably the best part of the experience. That is all. ",1
"Although our view of the fountains were spectacular, I found the room to be dingy, old, and small, compared to the Wynn or Encore. Also, since we were taking the red eye back to Boston, I paid for an extra half day until 6pm on a Friday. At 5 45, my daughter and sister tried to get into the hotel room, and it was locked our keys turned off! The security guard could not reach a manager, and would not let us in to get our luggage, even after I showed them my receipt and my ID. I was furious. I called the front desk several times before I got the ""on call "" manager. She apologized, and refunded my fee for the half day. Meanwhile, she said we had a limo ride to the airport, all taken care of ""just go to the bell man out front they have your name "". Needless to say, when I went there, they had no idea what I was talking about, so I again tried to reach a manager in vain. It is apparent that one hand has no clue what the other is doing in this large hotel God forbid, if there was an emergency in a room they wouldn't let you into your own room! We ended up taking a cab to the airport. The manager did call me again after I reached the airport to apologize for a second time about the lack of communication. You can always walk by the fountains I do not recommend staying here if you are used to first class service and excellent, modern accommodations.",1
"I know I know. It's like a sin for me to have Panda Express because I'm Asian. But, in the city of sin, it's okay to commit sins, right? At least that was my logic although I also eat Panda Express outside of the city of sin, but that is not the point! n nI was looking for some comfort food and was craving white rice, fried rice, or chow mein. We walked in and I was a little bit giddy. I always order the Chicken and String Bean, so I got that and my friend picked the Pepper Chicken. We shared one of those two entree dealios with half chow mein and half fried rice. n nThe lady at the cash register was a little bit rude. I asked if I could have an extra plate for us to split the meal and she looked at me like I was crazy. We didn't get any napkins, so I asked her if I could have some. As she's staring at the register, she waves me off and says ""behind you. "" Okay lady. n nI sat down, smelled the food, and smiled. I only had a banana and some tater tots for breakfast brunch and it was about 2 30PM, so I was starving! I took a bite of the chicken and string bean and it totally hit the spot. I pretty much devoured my half of the food, and sat there rubbing my little food belly. n nWe had a bunch of different tasks to get done for the Bachelorette Party Bridal Shower, so a quick and yummy meal was perfect. n nJust an FYI, this is inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel Casino in the Miracle Mile Shops area.",2
"After posting my previous review about my 1 star experience on New Year's Eve, I was contacted by an employee offering to have me back for another meal and to refund my poor experience. I happily accepted, as I'm open to giving people more than just one shot. n nUnfortunately, they messages they sent me were deleted not by me. and my attempts to contact them directly at the email address provided in the message have gone ignored. n nNot only was my experience with their restaurant very poor, my experience with their customer service after the fact has been extremely disappointing as well. I can not stress enough how poorly I rate this establishment.",1
"I have been coming here since the new owners took it over in May and I will not go any where else. Larry and Kate have created a wonderful spa to come get nails, toes, eye brows, facials, all kinds of waxing. I always bring in crazy pictures of nails and they make them happen no matter what. This picture is from today.",2
"How much fun is this place? My husband's company management has been talking about doing a corporate function here so we thought we'd stop in and get the membership cards out of the way. I love that there was a woman up front to greet us and guide us where we need to go. Byron took excellent care of us at the membership counter and he's a fellow Iowan and Hawkeye fan so he's got my vote for Employee of the Month. n nThen we walked around and checked out everything. We really liked how roomy each section is with plenty of seating and a couple of TVs. The range looks like a lot of fun with a variety of targets, and I also noticed how clean everything was. n nWe cruised through the bar and noticed there are some large booths with their own TV so you can sit with your group and watch your game of choice. They also have a gaming area for those not swinging a club. There were a lot of staff around and they were smiling and making sure people had what they needed, or answering any questions. n nWhile on the way to the restrooms I noticed they have some meeting rooms and one group had booked one for their fantasy league draft. We got a look at their catered food of wings and some other munchies and it all looked and smelled delicious. I didn't snag any as I walked by, I swear! n nEven though my golf clubs are only in the house as potential weapons now and I call myself a reformed golfer, I would definitely look forward to a corporate event or night out with out of town guests at Topgolf. GREAT place!",2
"How many different ways can I say ""food poisoning "". I know.it's shocking.a Michelin star and all.but it's true. The only thing I ate that my husband did not was their ""signature "" Maytag blue cheese souffle. I woke up the morning after regretting ever having stepped into the restaurant. It was violent. I guess it can happen anywhere. To tell you the truth, the most shocking part of the experience was the total apathy of the restaurant management. I called to inquire let them know. They promptly referred me to ""security "", who referred me to ""risk management "", who blew me off. I guess they won't respond unless my lawyer calls. Craziness.",1
I'm fairly surprised at how many good reviews on this are here. This place was absolutely disgusting! The food was so bland and tasted like it had been sitting for a couple days. We should have known better when we walked in and the owner was sitting there picking his ear! The waitress lady was nice but the food was horrid and we all felt sick afterwards. This place was recommended by a friend and now I have to murder her! STAY AWAY!,1
Let's see. their food is not very good. I like to eat plain cheese pizza or with pepperoni at the most. All their sausage meats are horribly salty which sucks so pepperoni pizza is very difficult for me to eat. It really helps to add veggies on it. n nTheir new chicken advertised on TV was so gross. It has an odd odor and once you take a bite of that round nugget a bunch of oily gelatin comes out. The kickers are a lot better. They could also try training their drivers to hold the pizza correctly so that the toppings are still on the crust and not on the box. I thought the CEO didn't want to see any more bad pictures of their pizzas when we send them in. Why can't my friends stop insisting that we eat here? LOL,1
"Wow. A gem near my house. I'd never been there til a friend wanted to meet up. We're craft beer drinkers and there was a ton of draft. It was late at night and the one I wanted was out, but they had a ton more. n nI'm also a burger guy and the burger was awesome. They gave me exactly what I wanted, and bartender waitress came by just enough to be attentive and not annoying. I felt very welcome here, got exactly what i ordered, was offered a sample of a few beers before I bought, and was able to watch four large screen HD tvs showing the ball games and Olympics. Great place . I'll be back.",2
"The reviews here are spot on. The best pad thai in C U if not the best pad thai that I've had period. I remember eating here my freshman year when my cousin brought me here. I had a craving for some pad thai, so I decided to come here again. Ordered an order of shrimp pad thai. I usually order beef pad thai wherever I go, but I decided I would try something different. Very large portion, easily enough for two meals. Great flavors as well. My only gripe is that they left the tails on the shrimp, so I was faced with the option of picking them off, which is a pain or just eating the tails on. I went with the latter, which wasn't a big issue, but still undesirable. Next time I'll be ordering beef pad thai.",2
"One liner Super clean, super friendly. n nThey do a GREAT job here for massages. They will listen to exactly what you need and want and try to meet your needs. n nOne hour massage is 70, so comparable to other locations.",2
"I stayed here for a conference in September and stayed in a concourse room. I was unimpressed with the hotel. n nThe lobby would most likely be magnificent if it were bigger. There is a grand staircase as the centerpiece but it feels like the whole lobby was mini scale. n nMy room was on the 5th floor. When I got off the elevator I immediately noticed an ""old "" smell like an old persons house. The decor was incredibly dated, I'm guessing 50's? And not in a kitschy way, this was probably a nice hotel the year my parents were born. n nMy room was no better. Ancient decor, funky smells. The only nice thing was the size. It was a spacious room however I cannot understand why the bathroom was so small. You had to straddle the toilet to open the door. n nThe beds were incredibly soft so if that's your thing, you'll be ok. Either way, you will find it impossible to sleep due to the freight train like HVAC unit in the room. Not onlynwas it as loud as a jet every time it kicked on, it was maddening to set. It was slow to respond and inconsistent with the temperature. I would be comfortable and then all of a sudden it was blazing hot in the room. n nThe shower was adequate but had low pressure. The size of the bathroom really was a downside. But since you can't leave the door open and shower you would not be able to exit the shower they did have fans in the bathroom. That helped with the humidity. n nI ordered room service one night and the food was average. I ordered hummus pitas and a white bean burger. The hummus was good, though a little thick. The burger was decent. The bun was fantastic. The burger needed something, I just couldn't place what it needed. It was delivered incredibly fast. They told me 20 minutes but it was delivered in less than 10. The waiter was really nice too. n nI stayed at Cambria last time and would go back there instead of here next time.",1
"This place is definitely 5 star quality food, but simply slow service. Expect to wait a while before you sit, and then wait a long time before your food comes. Breakfast on the weekend will be about a 2 hour ordeal. n nHaving said that the food is fantastic, all sauces are homemade daily. Everything is fresh, large portions. Their bloody marys and mimosas are excellent. I'm partial to choosing ""Green Flannel "" for breakfast, and without a doubt you must get ""The Rustler "" for the single best lunch sandwich in the history of lunch sandwiches. n nI have brought every out of town visitor there for several years and they always say ""that's the best sandwich I've ever had "". So go give it a try. If you don't want the Rustler, try the Bitchin' Chicken. n nI've never been there in the evening, but I intend on going for microbrews and live music sometime soon.",2
"WORST HOTEL IVE EVER STAYED AT IN VEGAS! n nFirst, housekeeping stole a 100 bill out of my wallet when they did the turn down service i dont gamble so I know I didn't spend my n nSecond, my key was deactivated about 15 times during my 4 night stay and the keys wouldnt even work when I would go down to the concierge and ask for a replacement so every time I wanted to get into my room I was at the mercy of security to let me into my own room. This was extremely inconveniencing at 2pm, 5pm, and 2am especially when security took their sweet time upwards of 30 minutes to let me into my room. n nTHEN, after I complained, one of the managers said I could have a 40 room credit which I planned to use on room service after I had gotten off work. I ordered a SALAD at 12am hoping it would arrive in an hour.no. Two hours later, I called to cancel my order because I was going to bed.starving. n nFinally after that charade happened, I left a dress in another room. I called 2 weeks later wondering if it had been turned into lost found. Immediately the lady on the other line said it wasn't there and they only keep items for 14 days. Remind you, she hadn't asked what my checkout date was or for a description of the dress. So rude. I never wish a stay at the Aria upon anyone. Its aesthetically pleasing but the customer service is worse than Circus Circus. A bunch of selfish clowns who could care less about their consumer.",1
"Finally, I've found a cheesesteak place in Vegas that gets it right. Wiz, Amoroso rolls, steak and onions. Classic. n nPop's even has the look and feel of an authentic Philly Cheesesteak place order at the window, outdoor seating, food served in baskets. n nNo question about it, if you're looking for authentic Philly cheesteaks, this is the place.

Dr. Wilson is awful. I read the review of the person who had a hysterectomy there 3 years ago and is still having issues. . Well join the club I'm 1.5 years post op from her butchering hands and I had to have a second surgery by another doctor. I'm better but still have pain. They removed non dissolvable stitches that she uses and a hematoma. She is awful. Run don't walk away from this doctor!,1
"Thanks to Groupon I didn't have to pay full price for this mess! n nI will not be returning to this salon anytime soon and if I did it would NOT be with Josh! His conversation during my treatment was very unprofessional with his coworkers, he barely talked to me at all, and then my hair cut and deep conditioning treatment took TWO hours! n nI have curly hair and he cut my hair curly then straighten it which I did not want done because he said he had to ""make sure it was even. "" I think if you have to straighten someones curly hair just to make sure it's even then maybe you should only be cutting straight hair. Never in my life has anyone had to cut my hair curly THEN straighten it and cut it again! That's just crazy! And when I mentioned this to him his response was ""ha ha I know what I'm doing, I do this shit all day "". Lastly on top of all that mess be BURNED my scalp TWICE with the straightener. n nI will never go back to him and I may never go back to this salon, but if I do it will be with one of the girls that has good reviews on here! n nOther than him, the receptionist was very pleasant, she offered me something to drink, the music was good, the salon was clean and well taken care of, and they also had a sign up that said something along the lines of ""If your children aren't here for services, please leave them at home. "" which I find refreshing because it seems like everywhere I go now a days is also a unofficial daycare! n nBottom line If you don't have Josh I'm sure you will have a much better experience than I had.",1
"We had a 3 00 late lunch on Saturday in early October of this year. We figured it was later in the day, thus explaining the emptiness of the place. By that, I mean, we were the only ones there. Towards the end of lunch, that hadn't changed much. With the ""Best of LV "" reviews I've read previous, I was rather surprised there was no other customers. Knowing this was a bad sign we were parched and hungry from earlier activities and ventured inside. We ordered the papaya salad, chicken on a skewer, pad Thai noodles, and a grilled pork plate. Every dish we ordered was bland and lacking in ""wok hei. "" What is that you ask? Wok hei is the Chinese term describing the fragrance of food that is cook correctly in a wok. Also, it's a pet peeve of mine when drinks we ordered were served in plastic cafeteria cups. I'm not 10 years old and am certainly not paying cafeteria prices. After a 50 lunch bill for 2 adults and one restaurant phobic child, we were told that restaurant is under new ownership and would not accept the Restaurant.com certificate. The whole reason we even tried the place was because of a Restaurant.com certificate. Needless to say, that was our first and last time dining at the Mix Zone cafe. Restaurant.com customers beware because they still offer the certificates to this restaurant on their site even after I notified them of the problem.",1
"Located on St. Paul Street in Old Montreal Taj Mahal offers Authentic Indian Food. Frankly I don't expect a lot from places located in touristy areas. But Taj Mahal proved me wrong. The restaurant pretty much has no decor. Just tables and chairs crammed into a room. Service is not too fast. My rating for em till this point was 2.5 stars. Then the server brought the complimentary poppadoms with the sauces. They were really crisp tasty. We ordered the Chicken Vindaloo Lamb Madras with Garlic Naan Basmati rice. Both the vindaloo Madras had a zing to it. The chicken was perfectly cooked, so was the lamb. The nan's were freshly baked and the rice was fluffy aromatic. One of the best Indian places I've been to in Montreal. The ratings jump to 4 stars. The service might seem slow, but I guess cooking something well does take time. I'd say while you wait for your entree's, sip on to Indian beer Though I'm not a big fan or some White wine Goes really well with spicy food . The place is a bit pricey, but its Old Montreal, Touristy area. blah blah. But yeah definitely worth a visit n n nFood Really Good nService Ok nAmbiance Pls message me if you find an Indian restaurant with good ambiance. nWorth the money Oui",2
Good for all you can eat sushi. Service the last time I was there was bad but probably because I came with a group of 10 people. Never had a problem before with the service.,2
"I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night. nService was excellent, and highly attentive. nFood, absolutely horrible. n nMy expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. nWhat I was hoping for was a 1 1 1 2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. nWhat I got a a 3 4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. nSalad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet nVeggies, blah. nBread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. n nIn addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. n nI've had it with this place. nIf I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1 1 2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle",1
"I stopped by chop shop one sunny afternoon, and after I finished ordering I inquired to the young girl behind the counter how things are going. She replied ""Well, good. In fact, most people who came here on day one still come back almost every day "". This, is good! n nYou know what else is good? Their menu is good. Delicious, and fresh, and healthy. I had the Kale Caeser and it was fantastic. The lemon dijon dressing is definitely to die for. My only complaint was that there weren't enough tomatoes for me. I cannot wait to dig into the rest of the fare.and alas I have tried two of the fresh juices. The liver cleanse and the power green were to two I tried and they were fabulous. I love fresh juice, and the flavor combinations are powerful. The server almost gave my juice to the wrong person, but thankfully they write your name on the cup to avoid this confusion. Also, having written your name down the staff addresses you personally and it creates a more familiar feeling. n nGo try Chop Shop! Your body will thank you.",2
"Truth be told I had food beverage credit at the hotel and figured I'd use it at the cafe for brunch last saturday.I was with 2 friends and we each ordered 3 egg dishes from the menu. Nothing complicated, yet they managed to screw it up big time. After 45min of waiting pasiently we thought we'd ask our waiter what the hold up was for considering everyone around us were already being served.Indeed he said it would be out shortly.10min later we asked him to kindly bring over the manager who never came by. Another 10min passed and I was forced to bring over the manager myself who informed us that our order was originally mixed up and would be charged on the house. All in all they mixed up a few things even after making us wait over an hour for our order. I won't go back even if it's for free. n If you order hash browns and prefer them to be cooked well ask them to make it CRISPY or else you'll end up with soggy potatoe strings eEw.",1

"This is a really great place to hang out and bowl especially during their specials through out the week. Definitely has not changed decor in ages, but it makes it more interesting and sort of a hipster feel. The first time I tried this place out was during their 80's night and all you can bowl for what I can remember being a total of 12. n nThis bowling alley also has a bar in the back which makes it even more fun! I have not had their food at all yet so at this point I can't really say if it is good or bad, but I do not have high expectations since it is most likely regular bar food. n nI will certainly be back for college night, which is 50 cent bowling and 50 cent drafts 9 12 with an 8 cover charge.",2
"The gravy here is the balls! n nLet me lay it out for you, the basic poutine has 3 ingrediends fries, gravy, cheese. Fries can be thick thin, crispy or soggy. Cheese can be sqeeky and fresh or not, and applied in various amounts. BUT, the secret . the real magic . that's in the gravy baby. n nMa am m Bolduc's gravy is meaty, peppery, and full of wonderful. n nThis little resto is tucked away on a quiet street, and has an enjoyable front patio for good weather pitchers of beer are a plus .

"Saw the perfect Valentine's Day gift for my spouse, and trekked off to macy's to see if I could find it. Told the clerk at the jewelry counter what I was looking for, and after she reviewed the inventory, informed me that they were currently out of that item. Since she wasn't sure when they would be getting any more in . . . she suggested purchasing it on line. n nNot a rookie when it comes to ordering on line, I decided that would be the best way to obtain the gift. Placed the order, paid for the express shipping . . . and here were are two days before Valentine's Day, and still no gift in hand. It has been a week since I ordered it, and the UPS tracking says that delivery should be tomorrow. n nAfter an hour on the phone with customer service to see what the problem with the express shipping was and could I get a refund since I seem to have been sent normal delivery . . . I was told that Macy's does not refund shipping fees, because once it leaves their warehouse, they are no longer responsible.

"We love the atmosphere in here! And their drinks are amazing. My favorites are their different flavored mojitos. The raspberry mojito and the lychee mojito being my bar far favorites. We love all the different areas to sit, whether that's at the bar or at private booths. They have two large beautiful fish tanks. And there's a pool table and a shuffle board too. The fireplace makes for a nice area to sit around as well. We haven't had a chance to sit on their outdoor patio yet due to the weather.",2

"Comet Grill might still have great food, but when I tried to take my daughter her husband there this noon the server did not like the looks of my son in law's NY license, and asked to see his passport! It was clearly discrimination against a person who's of Hispanic descent. Totally inappropriate, and such a disappointment to the good time I was trying to show my kids. I can't in good conscience continue to go there, or to recommend it to others. It hate it, because this used to be my favorite place to go for a cheeseburger, but no more.",1
"Every time i come to Pittsburgh, i make sure i visit Furnish! So far i have bought something every time. The artistry is top notch",2
"The pizza was fine. My issue is that, if you aren't like other pizza places with your pricing, you should maybe tell me that when I call to order a medium with two toppings. We ended up with a 36 pizza that will take us days to eat, when I THOUGHT I ordered a medium with pepperoni and sausage on half. All young kids working there. No professionalism. No explaination of anything. 50 cents per slice for every topping? Well yeah we got 14 slices, so do the math. NOT a medium. Boxed up horribly, so on our 3 minute ride home, the box was leaking grease out of the corner. I was so upset over spending nearly 40 on something that I thought would be cheap and easy, I couldn't even enjoy the pizza. Its just whatever pizza anyway. n nSave your money and go to Slice on Broadway. 1 3 of the price, staff is wonderful, and they have a liquor license and fair prices. Slice should get half the publicity this place gets. n nNever mind that I've lived in Pittsburgh all my life and have never heard of Betos until I moved 3 streets behind it. NOT a ""Pittsburgh institution. """,1
"Went to McKoy's this past Saturday. I can't speak to the food, since I did not get to try any even after waiting over an hour and a half. Just more concerned about the management. n nWe arrived on what seemed to be a busy night, but they did not seem to have too many folks waiting. We asked how long the wait was for a 5 person table the hostess later found out manager said ""it could be 10 minutes, it could be 30 we just sat a real big group. "" ALL 5 of us heard the same thing. n nShe put our name at the top of a new list on paper. n nWhat we did not know is they just sat 90 of the restaurant as one group, and the group had many more tables arriving over the next hour. They basically had a dinner reservation for over 100 plus people in a place that might not even seat that many. n nWe waiting over an hour, and I would admit became frustrated. The hostess, pointed out a table that was ""ours "" when the group left, but then it was given to more arrivals of this huge party. We finally got a bar table for 5 after pushing for it, but heard from the tables around us that they were waiting for food for over 45 minutes and we decided to give up and eat at Bojangles nearby. n nWhile I can understand why they were in the situation with a hunder plus person group in the place I can't understand why the management allowed us to put our name on a list in this situation or even thought anyone would be happy that night! A group as large as the entire business is coming in for a meal you have a few options you don't take the reservation since you can't give them good service you close the restaurant and open for this group only, or you at least try to control the situation more by offering the group a limited or pre ordered menu. n nThe staff were frustrated, and were frustrated with us, and we were frustrated with them. but if they had just planned a bit better or told us the situation before we sat there for a long time we could have had a good meal at another nearby eatery, and come back and enjoy this otherwie well rated Smokehouse another time. THE FOOD LOOKED and SMELLED very good! Which in many ways made it even worse to have only seen it!",1
"Right when I walked in, it reminded me of another sushi place I've been to it didn't click until we got the check that it is Kaizen also in Vegas ! n nMy friends I came here about a month ago because we were craving AYCE sushi wanted to try someplace new. The reviews looked good on Yelp, so why not? n nThere were a couple of good things going for this place. It is a BIG space, which is nice compared to smaller sushi places like Goyemon or Sushi Koma. Another nice thing is that their nigiri is small, which we liked so we could have more of the other sushi. n nNow, onto the bad. The biggest thing I did not like was their service. We ordered the first round of sushi rolls which was fine. Then a couple more. Then we decided to ask the waiter for recommendations. We ordered some of the special rolls since our first round of sushi was mainly nigiri. Well, the waiter who brought our rolls brought the wrong rolls! the original waiter LEFT FOR THE DAY. Wait, what?! I'm used to places introducing the second waiter or at least letting us know if they are taking a break or leaving. So, of course, we're telling this new waiter that the rolls he brought us are NOT the ones we ordered. He kept saying one was the lobster roll we had a shrimp tempura roll which was the same thing! So we had these two baked rolls that were the same! which are heavy, so of course we got full faster. We didn't send one of those rolls back which was our fault, but in the end, they didn't charge us for what we didn't finish, so I guess we're even.",1
"Much larger location than Bellagio. Love the pastries, would pass on the chocolate and crepes. Are there other places that have dessert like this. no. Rather than going to a starbuck and getting something you can get anywhere else, suck it up and just buy some.",2
"The service was fast, friendly, and efficient. Unfortunately I can't give glowing reports about the food. I had breakfast there mid morning on a weekday, so the place was only about half full. The order came promptly, but the french toast which has gotten rave reviews was flat and half burnt, my egg over easy was runny, and the sausage patties were hard and dry. If not palatable, it was at least edible, with good table syrup. nOverall, I would rate this place a C .",1
"My boyfriend and I came here on a Groupon, and after reviewing the menu I was really excited to try this place. At first, everything was really nice. When we were being seated, the host told us a party of 50 was coming in, and that the back room might be quieter, which it was. The back room has 4 tables and is a nice intimate setting. Note, that in the time we were there, one tour bus full of tourists came in, ate, left, and another bus full was coming in as we were leaving. The bus loads of people appeared constant, and if we had sat in the main dining room, it might have been miserable. n nBut anyway. Everything we ate tasted really good. We ordered a goat dish, a lamb dish, and samosas. The veggie samosas were kind of bland, and only had potato in them, but tasted fine. When we ordered it was a little weird that the waiter asked us what kind of rice and naan we wanted, as if it came with our meal, when in fact it didn't. I've never been to an indian restaurant that charged extra for rice, so I thought that was a little shady. n nBut really none of that mattered, because towards the end of our meal, we found a hair in our food. A short, curly, kind of hair. We showed the manager. His response was ""do you want some more rice? I can get you some free rice to go? I'll take 10 off of your bill, mistakes happen, it probably came from the buffet. "" Um, number one, we didn't eat from the buffet, and number two, DUDE there is a pubic hair in our food. While I appreciate him taking a little bit off of the bill, what I would really prefer is for him to look disgusted, and go back to his kitchen and have a very serious talk with his cooks about hygiene and cleanliness. But I had the distinct impression that wasn't going to happen, and he just sort of acted like, oh these things happen sometimes. Maybe he didn't understand that this hair did not fall off of someone's head? n nSo, even though the food tasted good, and up until that point we had been having a nice time, I really don't think I can get past a pubic hair in my food. We won't be back.",1
"I don't know what's a Super C doing in this area, does not really match the Atwater Market vibe. n nThis is where you will see the gentrification occur before your eyes. n It's located between the fancy condos along the Atwater Market and Notre Dame Ouest. nPoor elderly wandering aimlessly as well as the yuppies avoiding them. Wow n nThe prices seemed a bit too high, and the selection is really just ok. Did not really see anything unique that jumps out at you.",1
"Hands down, great for breakfast. Well worth the wait. Yes there's usually wait but worth it. Good for couples and families, and the staff is friendly and quick. Busy but friendly and food is great.",2
"Of all the Indian places in Vegas. this is a frequent stop for me! I am pretty stuffed and satisfied everytime after dining here. The restaurant seems like a family owned business and the customer service is wonderful! They are super nice, friendly, and seem easy to get their attention if you need anything. There's also a TV playing in the corner with current Indian movies with plenty of bollywood dancing and hip current Indian music. n nThe usual dishes we order are n appetizers vegetable pakora and samosas, thinly spiced cracker don't know the name of it sorry n main dishes tandoori chicken, palak paneer, chicken korma, chicken makhani, lamb curry rogan josh n sides garlic naan and rice n nThe appetizers are very tasty and a good size that come with a mint jutney sauce and a spicier sauce. All the main dishes are very good also. Warning though, if you ask for spicy. these dishes can definately make you sweat like a banshsee! just ask my bf! I like them milder and ask for mild or a level ""3 "" and they are delish. Maybe ""5 "" or higher will be too spicy and possibly not enjoyable. but up to one's palate. The tandoori chicken comes out on a sizzling plate and the chicken is so tender and tasty, always a safe bet. The chicken makhani butter chicken is my absolute favorite! The korma and curry are pretty rich in spices and have very distinct flavors to the dishes. I think the palak paneer is alright but reminds me more of creamed spinach so maybe a pass. n nThis place is small and cozy but usually hopping with customers. The food may come out a bit slower when they are busy but it's worth the wait. Always happy with the food and service here that makes me keep coming back for my Indian food fix! I really need to come for the lunch buffet which looks like a great deal for the same food.",2
"Le Thai is, without a doubt, the best place to eat on Fremont Street East AND West .

"Not too many places in town that you can comfortably sit outside in the middle of our summers, but this place has an aggressive misting fan system going on and we were so excited until the smokers came out and took over the patio. So we had to move inside, it was a Friday night and they were going to have salsa dancing later, so our server seated us in the dance floor area. We primarily came to watch salsa dancing and for some mojitos, but I am a self proclaimed high maintenance cocktail drinker, I don't do cheap wine or alcohol, so I was bummed when I saw they make their mojitos with Cruzan Rum, so our bartender suggested 10 Cane Rum which I never heard of but we agreed to a pitcher. My first sip all I could taste was soda water. Yuck, this isn't a mojito, this is soda water on the rocks. I didn't say anything to my friends at the table, 2 others said the same thing. So we decided to give the Sangria a try. We ordered a pitcher of red, when it came out, I immediately noticed the color, it was pink, like Kool Aid, and that's exactly what it tasted like. If you mixed Ocean Spray Cran and Kool Aid together, you would get their week attempt at Sangria. No drink left behind, that's what I've always learned, but these were the worst attempts at 2 of my favorite cocktails I've ever had. We ended up leaving both pitchers because none of us could drink them. nI tried the mini Cuban sandwich, which was pretty good, as well as the plaintains, which is why this place is deserving of 2 stars. Our service was atrocious, so slow. I won't be returning.",1
"I had been wanting to try this place for a while as I read it was pretty good. I tried my BBQ favorite in the beef brisket. What a bad move on my part. Their brisket had no seasoning, no smoke flavor, was the opposite if tender, and even my mom who tried a few bites of my meal thought it tasted ""old. "" At any decent BBQ joint you will not see any brisket left on the plate when I am done, however with this joint I could not even finish half the portion it was so bad. n nOn the good note, the sides were really good I had mashed potatoes and gravy and potato salad and both were damn good. However, the brisket was SO bad that the sides could not bump this review above the one star. I do not enjoy paying over 15 for un seasoned, non smokey, old tasting brisket. n nOn a side note, I take no joy in giving a place, especially a non chain, locally owned joint a bad review. I tried to be as nice as possible, as I realize I only tried one item on their menu. To be honest, if their quality levels allow them to serve brisket this terrible, then I do not think I can give this place another chance. The brisket was shocking in its' badness.",1
"The food here is delicious! I am mostly impressed with the competent, helpful and friendly staff. I go there often and see the manager always working hard and nice to her employees and customers. All of the food I have gotten here has been good. The helpful friendly staff will guide you in making food choices which is nice with so many options. The Togo menu has the nutrition which is up front and helpful. nLove the salsa bar!

"When I used to live near Easter Road this was my go to guy for evening party drinks beer wine and cider wise He stocks many local microbrews and international brands. nThe owner is very informative on just about all the brands that he sells. nIt has a little continental feel to it.

Weird to say that but i find many an off license to smell of stale beer or other alcohol related smells, but here you don't have that at least not at the times I visited thus it smells different, fresh I like that. n nHe has several times a year when he brings out his bin ends and lets you have a taste as well. nSometimes he will throw in a branded beer glass as well doesn't hurt asking n nI am not so often visiting now and I actually miss it.",2

" This review is just for the casino.and parking lot. n nI just got back from this place and am so astonished that I had to write a review. I've been to my fair share of casinos and this one takes the cake for highest db ratio and lowest blackjack IQ. Before you think to yourself that I'm just writing this because I'm pissed off because I lost a bunch of money there, I spent three hours there playing blackjack and lost 25 total. That's basically breaking even, which I'm fine with. How I got to that point is another story. n nI came on a Saturday night, St. Patrick's Day to be exact.I don't know if that had anything to do with it but man, there were so many clueless blackjack players there. And I mean seriously just so awful, they shouldn't be allowed within 1000ft of a blackjack table. It absolutely blew me away. If you don't know ""basic strategy, "" you really shouldn't be playing, but if you don't have any common sense, you REALLY shouldn't be playing. More on that later. n nMy basic rule of thumb is if someone at the table does two bonehead moves going against basic strategy , I usually leave and find another table. Well this repeated four times out of my first four tables. A first for me. But whatever, I don't know it 100 . So I walk around looking for a table with some competent players having lost over 2 3 of the money I started with. I find a table with people who know what they're doing and guess what? WE WON! Everyone at the table was winning and I made back all the money I lost. Two of them do the smart thing and leave and me and the other guy at the table continue to do pretty well and I'm actually up about 30 when the worst blackjack player on the planet sits down next to me. This guy was doing stuff like hitting with 16 when the dealer is showing 5. Not even just screwing up basic strategy but just doing plain moronic stuff. I'm not sure he even knew how to count. He did crap like this several times and got an earful each time but he kept doing it. I should have left after the first time he did it but I was tired and thought I could overcome it. Nope, not even close. I left the casino shortly after. n nAnother example that just popped into my head is when I was at an earlier table and a girl wanted to hit with 17 and the dealer showing a 10. ""I want to hit, is that so wrong? "" YES. n nThe casino itself wasn't that smokey even though it seemed like every other person was smoking. Basically every table had at least one or two people actively smoking. Way more than any Vegas casino I've been to and I was just there two days ago . There's definitely a younger crowd here, so the higher db ratio is to be expected, but man, is smoking the cool thing to do again? n nSomething else worth mentioning is that I played for about two hours at several different tables losing money and didn't get carded once. I went to another table and played a hand where I split 8's twice and doubled one of them and won them all. I then get carded. WTF? n nThe dealers were all pretty nice. In regards to the drink service, I was there for 3 and a half hours and received one cup of water. No need to say any more. n nOh and the parking lot.whoever designed it must have been mentally challenged or blind . n nThis place is a step up from your average Indian casino, but I'll take a Vegas casino over it any day.",1

"Pho soup is not that tasty compare to the one i always go! The service is not that bad! The price is too much for the taste! nA few cup of beef pride rice is way too expensive for 9.00 wow! Would not go back there! I spend about 60 dollars for 2 large soup thats almost taste like water and salt,1 beefpriderice,2 charlbroild fork that really tin and tiny! 1 can of coke that was accidentally spilled and was not replaced!",1
I love the late hours Massage Envy provides. I had a massage from Kellie Miller last night and it was awesome! She definitely took care of the problems I was having in my shoulders and neck but also found time in the hour massage to relax my legs and send me home completely relaxed. Kellie is into athletics and I highly recommend her for both relaxation or sports massage therapy. She knows her stuff.,2
"best service any music lover could ever ask for! i bought my first guitar from this location a while back and i recently just stopped in to buy my first pedal for my guitar. i have to say that Zachary i believe thats his name. slightly ginger hair, short scruffy beard helped me out so much! he spent over an hour and a half with me showing me letting me play just about every pedal they had out. he not only took the time to teach me how the pedal worked and what certain settings do and what sounds they make as I've never used a pedal before in my life but he also really took an interest as to what sounds i am into as far as playing goes and was also showing me cool sounds with different combinations of pedals that he thought would work well with my sound. he didn't try and push me toward any certain pedal just to get me out of there, he helped me to experiment with each sound to let the right pedal find me. his expertise helped me narrow down the selection and ultimately pick the perfect pedal. i walked out of there feeling extremely confident and happy with the choice of pedal, i was super anxious to get home and start experimenting! i from now on will ALWAYS be buying any future pedals guitars from this guitar center, they know what they are doing. thanks so much zachary!",2
"awesome. n nquality meats and cheeses. local, too! and the people that work there know their stuff. n ntheir make your own sandwiches are delicious and they do NOT skimp you on the amount of meat and cheese they put on them like some other places cough cousin's cough . you can get hot or cold sandwiches, hot or cold sides . and all are tasty. ni recommend both the potato and mac salad. if they have mashed potatoes, those are pretty awesome too. n ndon't miss this place.",2
"I went to this urgent care tonight because it said they had on site x rays and I suspect I may have broken my tailbone. I paid a 60 co pay for vitals and to have my butt poked 5 6 times. Was given a referral for imaging elsewhere and that was it. Ill have to pay another co pay there! I came here specifically so I wouldn't have to do that. The doctor I saw never said anything outright but his attitude about me ""still "" breastfeeding my son was obvious and disgusting. I left in more pain than I arrived. With no painkillers because they're apparently not safe for breastfeeding, despite the fact that I was actually given some after giving birth! I am totally disgusted with my experience here and unless they take steps to fix it I will not be returning.",1
"Went to Owens on Saturday to grab a quick breakfast before heading out of town. I have been to Owens many times over the years. Recently, I quit going for a while, because everytime I went, my bagel would be super soggy and greasy. n nSaturday, we decided to give it another shot, in the hopes that Owens had gotten their stuff together.they had! n nI ordered the Hangover Helper on wheat egg, cheese, ham and comes with a drink.named appropriately! . It came out the perfect mix between steamed and toasted with tons of ham. So delish! Will definitely be returning soon. n nThere was a pretty good line when we left. There are only a few people working but they seemed to be getting through people fairly quickly.",2
"Best airport restaurant I have ever been to. The food was amazing, and my waitress, or culinary guidance counselor was great. Her name was Jennifer. She was helpful, sweet and gave great advice! n nShe steered me to the corn nut scallops and bruschetta duo. This was not her first recommendation, mind you. She gave a suggestion, listened to my response, asked a few questions and sent me to the promise land of culinary delight! Super amazing service and food, all in an airport restaurant?

"Bad customer service. I frequent many reflexology foot spas in vegas, typically I encounter a warm friendly environment. Not here. I was TURNED AWAY. after I called and made an appointment 1 hour earlier! I showed up at 11 30. I knew it was close to their closing time so I called 1 hour prior to showing up. There are too many competitors for bad customer service in las vegas. I will never visit this foot spa again.",1
I wouldn't rave about the food as we went there for breakfast and while the service was great the food was ok and definitely ok for the expensive side. The 4 of us had breakfast and it was nearly 200 including tip as we had a couple of juices and coffees. Just crazy! I ordered the chicken congee which lacked flavor and condiments. Probably not in a hurry to go back. Service was excellent though as you would expect but the breakfast menu ok.,1
"This place is quantity over quality. I came for a weekday lunch and for 10, the food was just ""meh. "" I would not let this be your introduction to dim sum, because those dishes are not very good. You can get a real dim sum lunch elsewhere for comparable pricing. Eagles is an option if you want a variety of mediocre food. To be honest, nothing really stood out for me. My friend randomly threw some cash into a slot machine and won enough to cover our meals. That was good because i wouldn't pay to come back. Service though, was pretty good. Our plates were cleared and drinks kept full.",1
They were quick and easy I did not have time to read the paper!,2
"Just ok. Nothing to go out of your way for. I had the chicken combo plate. I was hoping to find the so called ""hole in the wall "" that is an undiscovered gem, but nothing but average.",1
"This place has wicked good BBQ at super low prices. The sauce here is tart and vinegary. When they say spicy, it actually is a bit. n nThey cook the meat over wood, for pete's sake. Imparts a great flavor. n nThe only reason they are not 5 stars is the sides. Just aren't great. The bread is insipid fries ok, but how hard is it to get fries wrong? n nCounter service is ok not problematic, not dynamic customer service, either. n nIt's not really a hang out an' chill place, very chow down and git atmosphere. Take out is the best option. Daily specials of lots o' meat for super cheap are the best reason to eat here.",2
"Went to Dr. Moss for my first ever annual I was nervous but Dr. Moss knew her stuff and made me feel really comfortable, she's gentle, the staff was friendly, office is well kept and I wasn't there long.

"I usually go to a new place with enthusiasm and anticipation, hoping that the experience will be a good one and the first of many to come. My dinner at Bar Bistro last night will be the first and last, I'm sorry to say. It started out well, as four of my friends and I met there to socialize and check out this place. First of all, when we were seated on the patio around 6 00pm, our waiter brought us two menus to share because, ""we can't find the other ones right now. "" Huh? There was one other party on the patio and the inside of the restaurant was empty. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was excellent, and I was excited to see how the food would taste. From the tapas menu, we had the french onion soup, sweet potato fries and house fries, 4 cheese mac, and the tempura alcachofa artichokes in a sort of tempura fried batter . The sweet potato fries and soup were good, the other dishes were just okay. My friends also ordered the Paella Velazquez, but I didn't eat any of that and they also graded it as okay. For dessert, we shared the Ricotta Citrus Cheesecake, the Triple Gelato coconut, mango, and dark chocolate , and the Donut Churros cinnamon sugar with chocolate sauce I think those and the sangria were the best part of the meal! Seriously! After dessert, two of the waiters whisked our wine glasses away since we overheard them say that they ran out. Menus and wine glasses are apparently in high demand there. n When it came time to pay, four of us whipped out our credit cards and were admonished by the waiter that they don't split checks. Well, we didn't ask to have the check split, but we were going to split the bill among us. He told us that he could take 3 credit cards maximum, we should work it out amongst ourselves, and he'd return when we had done so what?! None of us had ever been to an establishment that had such a rule and all it did was make us angry. What does it take to swipe one extra credit card, after all? It's too bad that our meal had to end that way, but now we can say we've been to Bar Bistro once.",1
"After attending Tryst 4 times, including bottle service, I have to regrettable give a bad review. nThe security is biased to a women's perception of events. My good friend who has participated in all 4 previous bottle services was interrogated and escorted out of tryst for being hit in the face. He was hit in the face! He did not provoke the situation, but was accidentally a bystanders. nEven the alleged victim stated my friend had not committed the violation. n Sadly, he was escorted out because the casino follows procedure to prevent possible law suits from the victim. n nSo, the Winn would rather offer subpar customer service that take a chance at possible lawsuit. No proof was ever shown. n nI regret to say that I will never partake in any Winn Encore events or clubs. n nYou have lost a loyal customer. Consider re evaluating your protocol in situations like this.",1
"This mornings experience was horrible. I pulled and the lady was on the phone. She asked that I push the button. I reversed my vehicle to do so. I pushed the button, drove fwd back to her and she asked me for a ticket. I stated it didn't provide one and then she said to reverse again and push the button again. So, I did so and the machine said out of order. Then while on the phone age screamed something about aisle 3. I drove off, parked and once I parked the driver asked if I was auth to park in the covered parking. Horrible service! I didn't mind paying extra.but if the lady was doing her job, I would have known that. Never returning back to this dump!",1
Nice It's so different with the other BRUNCH I had before. Should have a try. ,2
"As a business owner on Mill Ave, I was excited to finally try out Regions for lunch today which is literally a stones throw from our office. n nMy business partner and I walked over, had a friendly greeting from the staff and were seated right away. I was happy to see that there was actually a good amount of people in the restaurant, something that was hard to know from the street view. n nA big fan of salads, I ordered the Grilled House Chicken Salad I believe the name is correct, might be house grilled chicken salad and my friend the Fish and Chips. n nWhen the food came out I thought there was an error because there were two scoops of chicken salad, on my salad, where I was really looking for grilled chicken not a big fan of mayo . What I realized is that I actually had ordered a chicken salad salad, that might contain grilled chicken. As far as how the menu was written I was convinced I was getting grilled chicken. n nTo the staff's credit, they swapped out the order right away with my next options, a grilled chicken caesar salad, however, it was too fast and I soon realized why. The salad was no more than bagged lettuce and precooked grilled chicken thrown on top with croutons, dressing, and grated parmesan cheese tossed on . Not how I want to spend 9. n nMaybe it was my fault for trying the salads, but today they were certainly 0 2. n nAs far as the fish and chips went, I didn't have the fish, but the fries were pretty good. n nI'll certainly try them again when I'm not in a salad or lunch mode, but with as times as tough as they are on Mill every detail matters!",1
"If you haven't burnt all your money at the tables, finish it all off here! n nThere is something for EVERYONE at this seemingly endless mall. n nIf you enter Caesars' main casino entrance, expect a long walk through a loud, ringing, bustling casino floor to see way too much of Celine Dion til you get to the mall entrance.",2

Really good brunch food lots of fruit flies including ones dying in two of our coffee cups coffee was good besides that though had French toast which was really good but at 10 it should be. Steak and eggs was also very good but at 22 it should be as well. Management should've removed both coffees from bill but tried to attribute them to open doors in the back. Which is not how fruit flies appear.,1
"Great atmosphere. Unique menu! CJ was our waiter and he was fantastic. Extremely knowledgable about the entrees and has good suggestions for our dining group. Triple George is truly another business that is aiding in the revival of downtown! Kudos to the entire staff, the Mahi Mahi was OUT OF THIS WORLD!",2

"I joined this gym in January with my fianc u00e9. It was crowded but everyone expects that when you join a gym in January! It was a great experience then. The cardio cinema is really great. I wanted to do my review after about 5 months to get the full picture. Well the place is now so overcrowded with people just standing around and the people there are what people warn you about with North Las Vegas. Not comfortable at all coming except to go to a class and leave. I would not go there just to work alone any more. Also, there really needs to be a timer for the movies because on more than one occasion I had to actually call the front desk to ask for someone to come and restart the movie! Sad to see this awesome gym go down hill so quickly.",1
"This place is so delicious.Seriously, it's one of my favorite restaurants in the ""West Coast ish "" area. The boyfriend and I went here on our trip to Vegas this past March and I loved this place so much that he recently took me to the one in New York. I didn't love my food at the New York location as much as I loved my food at the Vegas one. Seriously, it was just that good. After our delicious dinner accompanied with wine and dessert we went to the lounge club area upstairs. I remember it was a Thursday night and there weren't too many people at the club but I still had a great time. Lavo brings back so many wonderful food and dancing memories that I would recommend it to everyone going to Vegas.",2
I always get boba here when I visit LV. The service is fast and friendly. The shop is clean with a ver hip feeling. But the main reason I come here is the boba is always fresh and the perfect consistency of chewiness!,2

"Really fun show with awesome special effects, dancing and beach boys music. Went opening night and they had us rockin in our seats! Not your typical vegas tired old cirque show, surf is totally worth seeing!",2
"I really have mixed feelings about this place. I first off would like to give a HUGE thank you to the volunteers who take the time to actually help out here. But sadly I don't think I will come back. You can never get a hold of anyone on the phone, you have to leave a message and hope they get back to you. I had to leave 3 messages to finally get a phone call back. My dog was spayed here and it was not very clean inside. She was very heavily drugged and the icing on the cake was my poor dog caught kennel cough while she was there. The price for her spay was good but I should have taken her to a Vet and paid a little more but without kennel cough, without the cost of an extra vet exam, without the cost of antibiotics and without my dogs pain she had to go through.",1
"Let me start by saying whatever happened to cooking Christmas dinner? I am Jewish, so for me Christmas Chinese food, but apparently the secret is out. I went here tonight with the BF. We had made reservations for 7 30 and arrived at 7 20. The place was clearly understaffed as the two hostesses were running around like crazy acting as waitresses and bussers in addition to trying to host. As we stood there waiting for our table, about half of the tables in the restaurant left. You would think that this would make for a quick seating.surprise! It didn't. We waited for about 30 minutes to be seated. Additionally, several tables who did not have reservations were seated at the same time as us, which would have been fine if there were people working at this restaurant, but there weren't. So the BF and I sit there. The couple without res gets water, some small family that was seated at the same time gets water.we get nothing. The waitress comes around and takes their orders. Nothing. The family gets their appetizers and the waitress comes and takes their main entree order. Nothing. The other table gets their beers and sushi.still nothing! The hostess finally came by after at least twenty minutes and took our orders.we still do not have water. For real. And the place has gotten significantly less busy at this point. So we order the tangerine chicken and the pad kee mao with a 7 10 spiciness. We waited and waited. The other couple received entrees and just about finished them before we got our food. It was like we were in an episode of Seinfeld or something. The service was that bad. n nWe finally get our food and I will admit, the tangerine chicken was tasty. It was sweet and savory.pretty good. The problem is it was luke warm.like it had been sitting for awhile. Not cool. The pad kee mao was a disaster. First, it had about a 1 2 star spiciness level. Not spicy.at all. Second, in addition to not being spicy it was bland and kind of tasted like dishwater. Third, the veggies were still essentially raw. The dish was terrible. I have had much better real Thai food for a fraction of the price. We barely touched the dish, but no one showed us any concern or asked if our food was alright. The entire ordeal lasted one and half hours.for just entrees and water. Overall, the experience was terrible. n nI know what you're thinking.But Jennifer, it's Christmas!. Yes, I know it's Christmas, but I don't care, it isn't an excuse. I made a reservation. If they they did not have the space, they should have A not given us a reservation or B not let in walk ins when they had reservations. Whoever owns this restaurant should have put more thought into staffing for a night that they KNEW would be busy because they took reservations! It was unacceptable. The place only got a second star because the tangerine chicken was good, but I would be hesitant to go here again because apparently my business means nothing to this restaurant.",1
"I like Sushisamba a lot. It was a fun restaurant with a cool, modern vibe to it. It is definitely one of the more trendy sushi restaurants that I have been to. In no way am I putting Sushisamba up there with my favorite Japanese restaurant, Sushi Ran in San Francisco. But it was definitely worth trying out. n nI didn't try the omakase, but I wanted to. I was with my wife, who doesn't like anything but meat and vegetable tempura, so I didn't want to be limited. So we just ordered off the menu, which was fine. The rolls here are definitely different then I'm used to. What with all of the foie gras and wagyu beef. The Neo Tokyo Roll was tasty. I liked the tuna and tempura flakes together. I also had the hamachi nigiri and the uni nigiri, both of which were very good. I love uni, and this was good. n nWe had the seasonal vegetable tempura, which was good. To be honest, I've had better tempura but by no means am I saying that this wasn't a good dish. I like vegetable tempura, so I would order this again. We also had the the three meat Rio Grande Churrasco. We chose the pork tenderloin, the hanger steak and the ribeye. The hanger steak was by far the best of the three, with the ribeye coming in second. It was so tasty. The pork tenderloin was a bit disappointing. It was dry and uneventful. Next time, I'm getting three orders of the hanger steak. And the sauces were a nice complement to the dish. n nSushisamba is fun. The food is good. And the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. I had fun here, and I think that adds a lot to your experience at any restaurant. I can say that I am a fan.",2
"RUDE RUDE RUDE! The two women I spoke to at this shop were very rude. One accused me of lying about a price quote. I was told 19.95 for a dozen of long stem red roses. When I went to the eastern store to get my roses the total was double what I was quoted over the phone at the Sahara location. The lady that helped me at the eastern location was very nice. She called the Sahara location to see who told me that quote. Originally I didn't get the name of the person who quoted me. Which pissed off the lady at the Sahara location and caused her to accuse me of lying, and she scolded me on when I call places to get quotes I need to make sure I get people's name when I get quotes. Then she accused me of lying. I told her ""mam I'm getting married in two days. I don't need a lecture from u. If this is not your price I will go somewhere else. "" She then said that's our price. I said ok. And I left. It didn't end there. I received a call from the Sahara location and missed it. I called right back. A women answered and I said I thing someone called me from ur store I have a missed call. Before she asked for my name she said ""um I don't know no one called anyone from here "" I said ""ok. We'll can u see of someone called Tiffany, I just got the missed call "" she shouts ""Did anyone call a Tiffany? "" She gets back to the phone ""NOPE! No one called you! "" Then I said "" Wow you guys really need to work on ur communication over there! "" She said "" excuse me? "" I said ""ya. U guys misquote people, accuse people of lying, call people. Then have no idea who u called. "" Then she said ""OK, anything else u need? "" I said ""NOPE "" Then hung up the phone. NOT HAPPY. Will never use this shop, and I will NEVER recommend them. Terrible RUDE service.",1
"Asian Mexican fusion? We HAD to check it out. nYou pick your style, meat, rice and extras. The actual food was pretty good, it just takes a while to get used to the ordering concept and the menu. nThe restaurant itself resembles a large, cold conference building. It was pretty stark and really open. Perhaps they need all the space for lunch rush, but definitely not on a typical Friday night.",2
"Visited location four times. First two times were great. Second two times strange and terrible.

I got transferred without notice.then Nicole Answers the phone. Asked me for my number, can't find my number.so I told her I got transferred and not sure why as Ashley was looking for my number. Then Nicole, states that my number is not in the system and ask if I was looking for Petco or Petsmart.really? Never asked me what I needed?.so I hang up and going to another competitor.

"I was gonna give no stars but luckily the nice guy that ACTUALLY helped us managed to turn around our bad attitude towards our experience tonight. Sorry I didn't remember his name but his associate from the receipt is 182856. n nSo on to my experience. I came in tonight w my mom looking at tablets laptops. Needed information so that my mom could find out which would be more suitable for her. Wasn't a lot of customers in the store. Just a lot of employees standing around talking. When my mom asked for help she was told we would be helped shortly. After 10 mins she asked for help again. Same thing. So standing there for more than 20 mins my mom was ready to leave. Then a young couple that JUST came in was offered help from a man that has told us multiple times he would find someone to help us. nWhy couldn't he help us himself? I have no idea. I usually don't write bad reviews but I'm pretty pissed off from the customer service or lack of that this lazy employee was showing. As my mother put it, ""I'm mad at that fatass guy. "" nAnyways finally the young man, who's name I forgot to get, helped us into getting a new laptop warranty plan. Luckily he had a wide knowledge of the computers was even able to help me decide on what to buy in the future. n nBest Buy, I suggest you get it together find some employees who want to work for you make you money but actually helping customers out.",1

"If it were a few years ago, I would've recommended Stripburger. It used to be a favorite. Prices went up, competition grew fierce and it wasn't as convenient for me to frequent it so its been a long while since I've been. n nMy brother and I were reminiscing and decided to grab dinner there tonight. I was pleased to see they still had the atomic fries on the menu. I recall them being delicious. They were still good, but I missed the heavy hand of jalapenos. These were pretty sparse. I ordered the jalapeno popper burger and he couldn't choose between the BBQ Whiskey burger or the Blue burger so he opted for the sampler of three sliders so he could try them both. He also got a shake since he used to love it. The burgers should have been prepared medium, they were medium well at best. The buns were dry, the meat crumbled. The fried cheese on my burger tasted like flour and grease. I pulled it off so it would be edible. His BBQ burger came with mayo and really threw off the flavor. At least, the shake was decent. n nThe waitress never asked how our meal was, but she was pretty prompt refilling drinks and taking our order. 40 later, we were wishing we went to In Out and bought doubles for everyone in line. Money would have been better spent. It's a shame how bad this place has become.",1
"Okay, I thought Pop's was great! Heard of all the hype and it was worth it! I ordered a steak philly with onions and extra whiz. I thought it was great! Good service and quick delivery!

"This is the worst parking garage. They do spray the stairwells with something that smells like bleach to clean things. However, we pay a decent amount for our monthly parking passes. And the spots are tight, with the lines faded and you can't even see most of them. Also, people park in ""no parking "" areas, and in the car rental spots and nothing is ever enforced even though there is signs that say they will be towed. There is giant cobwebs all over and the lights are constantly flickering or out.",1

"I've been here twice and the service was below par every time. They do have a lot of very large and nice TVs that are visible from every seat in the bar which is pretty cool. So that's the one plus. Their food was also pretty good as well. n nThe first time I went there, we were seated by the hostess rather quickly. However, they were extremely crowded and we waited for 30 mins and the waiter never came to take our orders. We waited a little longer until my boyfriend couldn't take it anymore and insisted upon leaving which I understood. So, we left hungry. n nThe second time we went there, we were excited to know that there was happy hour! There were advertisements all over the hotel that read "" 1 sliders at The Pub. "" That sounded appetizing! We went there during the designated time. This time it was not as busy. We asked our waiter about the happy hour sliders and he told us that they were not on the happy hour menu. We explained that there were advertisements throughout the entire casino and hotel that said sliders were 1 during happy hour. Our waiter did not honor it. After we ate our food and asked for the check, the waiter told us that he asked his manager about the special and apparently there was some sort of miscommunication regarding the slider specials. He also told us that if we wanted to come back tomorrow, he would honor it. This upset me because I think he purposefully waited until we were finished eating to tell us. n nI will definitely not be coming back here.",1
"After some consideration and an incident today with the office we're going from a 4 star review to a 2 star review. Why? The attitude of the office staff. n nThey obviously have amnesia regarding what you talked with them about and when confronted about what they said to you just two weeks ago, which contradicts what they're telling you now, you get shot back with attitude and, ""I talk to lots of people all day I can't remember every conversation. "" Nice. n nThe apartments themselves are really nice and the staff was nice until confronted with a situation then the nice facade falls right off.",1

I will have to say that the chips and guacamole was half decent, the rest of my meal failed to impress! nThe burrito had more of a Texas onion ranch taste to it. I was looking for more authentic, but I guess you get what you get in Vegas imitation! nThe service was OK, the bartender was more concerned about what she was doing later on in the night and her tip. nThe ambiance was pretty good though great lighting,good energy and slot machines on my table! nNext time it's off the strip to find some ""real "" Mexican fare!",1

"So my boyfriend and I tried this place out since our current timeshare suggested this place because it was new. Our situation was tricky, we decided to half the week by having my bf's parents take the first 4 days and my bf and I take the last 3 days of a one week stay. The room was comfy and convenient with a kitchen. The jacuzzi was a bit tricky since there's a curfew. Our experienced could have been a little better if it were not for one situation. n nWhen trying to purchase vouchers for the KA show we were asked three times if we went on ""the tour. "" We clearly stated three times, ""no we did not, our parents did. "" After the third no, the lady's attitude changed from cold to just plain rude. She spoke to us as if we were incompetent. I didn't want to have to say it, but I think she was AGEIST! She treated us like young kids. compliment bc we still look young, but irritating because of the child like treatment Mind you, we did NOT give her attitude! We were on vacation and had no time for nonsense. We were raised to respect our elders! More than I can say for some people. n nWe heard about this tour from my bf's parents and how excruciating the tour was for them. They were not pleased from all pushy sales people. In sales world a single ""no "" is not enough, but when said multiple times I'm sure that no becomes definite. The parents were incredibly irritated and agreed that it put a damper to their mini vacay. I understand it is sales, but taking the aggressive route aggravates guests. n nThe only thing that kept us pleased over the short period of stay was the casino South Point right next door. Overall we were disappointed especially use to being spoiled by our current timeshare. I doubt we will stay here again.",1
"Really? This is Batali's take on gourmet burgers? Before I rail on the burger, let's give some love to the things that were solid. Nutella milk shake that my buddy had was simply outstanding! The Beer selection is solid, with enough craft beer on tap and by the bottle to pair with any of the burgers. The fried pickles and the sauce for dipping was also a table favorite. Now when it comes to what should have been the star of the show, the burger, disappointment abounded at our table. The menu does offer what should be some appealing options but when they arrived the were really more akin to a Carls Jr 6 burger than a 15 gourmet burger. Nothing special on the patty and the bun frankly looked like something they had gotten from the bakery section at the local supermarket. If they were not pricey it would not be a big deal, but with the name on the door you expect big things and B B simply doesn't deliver. I live in Southern California, home to some of the best gourmet burgers in the country. If this place opened there it wouldn't last 6 months. Come on Mario, this is fixable, were talking burgers here!",1
"Creative fois gras dishes and fresh yellow tail tuna sushi pieces are delectable. Fantastic sake list. Excellent service from the friendly bartenders. Great place to eat dinner solo at the bar while reading and people watching. I'm not a fan of Vegas but when I'm here for work, this is easily my favorite place to eat and chill.",2
Ummm. I feel bad for the servers who have to sell the food. It has to be embarrassing for them to put a smile on while they are charging so much money for such a terrible product.,1
"I had really high expectations for this place after reading all the great reviews. I'm not sure if it's just me or maybe it was an off day but I've had plenty of burgers better than this. n nI will say though that the shakes they have are amazing, try to stay away from the floats. n nWe spent about 76 incl. tip on two burgers and two shake floats. n ngold standard I asked for my burger medium and it came out to medium well. I really didn't like the meat and it was 17! 17 is okay for me as long as it tastes good, but it was dry and pretty bland. n ni understand that every restaurant on the strip is expensive, but don't come here expecting SHAKE SHACK quality and i know it's wrong of me to compare since shake shack is located only in NYC, but there is no comparison. n nMaybe it was an off day when i went since they weren't very busy but our burgers took forever to arrive.",1
"The cocktail menu options were mouth watering. Great place to grab a drink with friends, especially on ladies' night out!",2
"This place has awful food. n nRight out of a freezer bag, fried and onto your plate basically. I've been here numerous times to see if it will change but nope. One of my roommates worked here and said the same thing, frozen food all around. And the worst part, ITS NOT CHEAP! n nI give it 2 stars simply because they do have delicious cakes. Although their selection is sometimes limited they do have good cakes. n nTime to shut down the kitchen and just sell cakes.",1
"I've seen this place driving by numerous times n nI called to do a delivery and the lady that helped me was nice, she just seemed a bit unorganized. I don't mind if someone is new, and this may have been the case. nThey delivered within 40 minutes which is what they stated. nThe lady that delivered was nice, but she dropped my food on the porch. I felt horrible for her and she seemed genuinely sorry. I told her it happens and not to apologize. The pizza box barely opened, but it was all squished together. I didn't want her to have to go back so I told her I'd keep it. I still tipped as well. nShe said she would call me when she got back to the restaurant to offer me a free pizza. That never happened unfortunately. n nI ordered n nFried Mozzarella very soggy when they arrived. nGarlic rolls they were good. Very thick heavy bread. nSausage and black olive pizza I was very disappointed with the pizza. The sausage was a bit odd. They had sliced sausage and it seamed to be huge thick chunks of chicken sausage which I'm not a fan of at all. The crust was okay. It tasted like most frozen crusts on thin crust pizzas. Also, they had almost no sauce on the pizza at all. I had a side of marinara that came with my fried mozzarella that I ended up dipping my pizza in to get more of a taste. n nOverall, the food to me seemed very poor and lacking in much flavor. Pizza seems to be a very hard thing to get right. I was hoping well for this place, but it looks like I'm going to have to stick to my normal pizza joint.",1

Do not use this company ! Completely incompetent . The instructor was smoking and cursing and not even paying attention while he took my daughter to a shady part of town to take her test . When I called the company to complain they acted stupid refused to acknowledge any wrong doing and hung up on me ! Very unprofessional ! n nOh and when I first called they thought I was someone else calling to complain about another incident . Wow! do not let your child get in the car with these people,1
If I could give them a negative star I would. Horrible customer service. We were promised better internet service than Cox and that was a joke. My husband decided to give them a try but we had to cancel because the internet service just wasnt up to par with what we needed. Unfortunately we were out of town so we cancelled 1 day after the 30 day customer satisfaction period. We were told over the phone by the customer service rep that it was ok and that he was back dating the cancellation date so we would not be charged the early termination fees but when we got our first bill we were charged over 500.00. I called to complain and told there was no record of my phone call and basically there was nothing they would do for me. nDo not sign up with century link you will regret it,1

"Christopher's has half priced wines by the glass at happy hour! And did I mention they have a book of wines, not a list, which makes choosing a few rather challenging! n nThe food was fantastic!

The Chef, Christopher himself, brought me out an impressive chocolate tower! I am still dreaming of it today! n nI had a wonderful and pleasant time at Christopher's. You can tell the staff goes above and beyond to make their patrons happy and they are very friendly! I definitely need to come back and have a 'real' meal.

there other location closed! this is my spot please eat here! they are awesome the service is great and now i have to drive to the east side to eat.i dont know what i would do if this location closed they have employees that have been working for them for 25 years i think that says something about the owners ummm like they are awesome. i ate today at this location to find out my dear marta and mirta are still there but manuel is not. the food was still great the service too i love chapalas,2
"I will preface my review by noting it took a whopping 1h50m to get food delivered from here. I think there were some issues as they forgot the meal of a person who ordered with us and also forgot a drink. Maybe it was an off night? Honestly I've had slow delivery but this sounds unbelievable to even say! n nI would definitely suggest to go eat at the restaurant versus delivery though alas for me it's too late. n nThe daal soup is good and was the best of what I had. The kefta pita wrap is tasty but I would suggest sharing it as it is a lot of kefta. Unfortunately, the tabooleh and fattouche both had way too much lemon, which overpowered the rest. n nAll in all, daal soup was great, the rest ok, and delivery was out of this world not in a good way .",1
"What a joke of a security staff they have here. Everyone thinks they are something special, and their lack of professionalism and bad attitude is a complete letdown for an old establishment. I would NEVER return and suggest you do the same.",1
"This is perhaps the worst salon with the worst customer service I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. We've been getting haircuts there for over 3 years, my son gets a cut each month. I tip rather well more than 20 and do my part. There have been a number of embarassingly bad haircuts but the one two weeks ago was the worst. I couldn't get back in due to a work trip out of town the weekend following and tonight, when I went in to complain, the manager couldn't wait to explain how she couldn't verify anything that was 3 weeks old might have wanted to do the math on paper rather than in her head . I explained that I had tried to fix it up but it was a mess and the bottom line was that I needed it fixed. When she kept arguing with me, I realized that she was only concerned about getting paid for this haircut, not about listening to me or doing the right thing here. I explained that it wasn't about the money at this point the hair cut was bad and it needed to be fixed. She just kept telling me what wasn't their fault. Ridiculous. The woman was incompetent at her job as manager never realizing that she wasn't getting an argument out of me I just needed my son to have his hair right but that the 9 she would get today would be the last 9 that salon will ever see from us. It's ok, it's just one cut per month, I get her logic but hopefully this review will express to more than one person per month that these people either don't know or don't care about getting the haircut right they just care about getting your money. There are plenty of cheap haircuts around. . . go somewhere else. Anywhere else.",1
"I was slightly underwhelmed by this place. I had mistakenly ordered their Monkey Brain, which turned out to be a hollowed out avocado stuffed with who knows what. When I informed the waitress that I anticipated an actual roll, she gladly provided me with the menu so I could make a selection of something I'd eat but neglected to remove the Monkey Brain from my receipt, which I did not eat any of. It would have been nice if she would have informed me that I was ordering something other than a roll, obviously not being from around Vegas. SO that was 9 wasted. nOn a positive note, my cup of hot and sour soup was pretty delicious and the second item that I ordered was the NY Roll. It was okay I was only able to eat half of it by the time I finally got it to the table. nDrink prices were insane, so we skipped on those. nOverall I feel like this place is way overpriced for mediocre food. It'd be a hard sell getting me back in here again.",1
"This company is GREAT! I would give then 10 stars if I could. We moved into a new house Easter weekend and discovered it was infested with ticks. I called Sam the Bug Man and they not only knew what to do right off the bat, they came out and did it the same day Sat before Easter . They were really nice and went out of their way to come out on short notice on a holiday weekend. I will be using them regularly. Don't hesitate to call them!",2
We coughed when we walked in. it has some distinct smell. And promptly left. n nMaybe some other time!,1
After hours of poker at Caesar's Palace it was time for some lunch with a friend. Walking around the hotel on Sunday early doesn't give you many choices and we blindly stumbled into Mesa Grill didn't even check Yelp reviews . n nWe were seated fast and taken care of from the second we sat down. Sadly the brunch menu didn't have the dish I was craving their version of a Cuban but I found up trying this southwestern steak sandwich item that was top notch. I special ordered a side of grits and they were to die for. I ended up ordering another side of them because I couldn't deal without more of that. Properly made grits west of the Mississippi is pretty amazing in itself. n nThe price was a tad steep for what I received which led to the 4 star instead of 5 but it is Vegas and we were at Caesar's so it is to be expected. I just think it notched the place a little back to reality for me.,2
"The food was ok but not anything to write home about, bland and something I could have easily found somewhere at home to be ehh about. I can say I told other people not to waste their time and money here. The only reason this place got 2 stars was that it was clean and out waitress was great. She may be one of the only reasons the place stays in business. Unfortunately, I can not remember her name but if you do go there see if you can get the waitress with the Perfect Circle tattoo on her back.",1
UN BELIEVABLE! It's like fresh out of Mama Greece's kitchen! Service is outstanding warm friendly. And the food? I'm not sure there are words in the English language to describe how amazingly delicious this was! Can't wait to come back! Thank you!,2
"BUYER BEWARE! n nWe recently purchased a dishwasher at this location. It seemed to be in good condition, it's a Whirlpool Gold, and we got if for almost half the regular price. It only had a dent in the back. The tag did not indicate that it had been previously owned, or even refurbished. It looked good, got a good financing deal, so we purchased it. n nToday was the first time we ran it with our dishes. It was weird, I started noticing dried on food on all my dishes.now, we don't usually put our dishes in with out rinsing them first, so I thought it strange.THEN, as I was removing the glasses from the top rack, I noticed something black coming out of the water holes of the upper blade.Odd, I thought. I called my husband over to show him, and as he is Mr. Fix it himself, he began to take everything apart. We found pieces of old rotting orange peel and celery EVERYWHERE! Inside ALL of the blades, the tubes, everywhere! no, we had not recently been eating oranges OR celery for that matter I think the washer had been previously bought, the owner probably ran it without securing the trap, it probably clogged so they returned it Sears wipes it down and sells it to us, with old food still stuck everywhere in it. YUCK, this is like a health hazard! We were so grossed out. n nWe did manage to get all the food out our ourselves, ran the thing with nothing in it a few times, and it seems to be fine now. I'm just wondering how this got past Sears inspection with flying colors? n nAnyways, if you choose to shop here, just beware. There are great deals, but remember, you get what you pay for ",1
"My friend and I decided to try different restaurant every friday, and Beijing Noodle Cafe happened to be very close to us and after checking reviews on yelp, we decided to give it a try, nI ordered the Lanzhou Beef noodle soup, and My friend ordered the Beijing black been noodles. the black bean noodles were a little bit salty however, the Lan Zhou Beef Noodle soup is lip smackingly delicious if you want to try any noodle dish, you should try this dish.

"I'm not sure if I got an errant chef there , but my meal tonight was sub par. The Truffle Onion Soup that everyone raves about was good, but that was about the only thing that was really GOOD for a restaurant of this kind. I expected to be wowed. but came out dissatisfied. We had the four course pre fixe and my second course was the divers scallops and they turned out to be salty. I told the waitress that they were salty and she said that it was a new dish and she would tell the chef. nothing against the waitress. our service was good . nMy main course was the halibut and it was nice and crunchy on the outside, but nowhere close to being moist or soft on the inside. I hate overcooked fish and this was close to overcooked for me. Also, again the corn base. forget what it was called was salty! nDessert my friend got the chocolate cake and that was good. gentle flavors and not too sweet. I got the panna cotta desert with a couple of sorbets on top. The panna cotta itself was good, but one of the berry sorbets was overpowering and too tart and didnt mix well with the peach juice base. nAlso, for some reason they advertize a 59 early evening prefixe on their website, but we went in at 6 15 and asked the waitress, she knew nothing about it. Instead we got the Elegance pre fixe for 89. n nI live near SF and have eaten at several restaurants that are better. Michael Mina for one. Cortez before it shutdown.",1
"Guys from our office started with some wings that are marketed as extremely hot, but the three of us concluded that they had a a little ""zing "" to them. The buffalo style was not Buffalo and the blue cheese dressing that it came with was flavorless and seemed more like sour cream. n nThe burger and fries was good, but under cooked, the fajita was good as well, but the beans they came with seemed like they were reheated from three days prior and had a weird taste. The shrimp wrap was OK, but the pablano coleslaw had no flavor they may have forgot to put dressing in it . n nThe server had a great personality, but was slow bringing food and had to repeatedly ask for the same refill of unsweetened tea, which he kept forgetting he comped the drink . The waiter shrugged off our comment about the food when he asked our opinion. If he waited and listened and gave feedback to the manager, they could have a better product. n nWe won't go back.",1

"SCAM ALERT! Now, I'm kind of disappointed that my first Yelp of 2010 has to be a negative one, but whatever, this place really pissed me off. According to the fine folks at Merriam Webster, organic is defined as ""developing in a manner analogous to the natural growth and evolution characteristic of living organisms arising as a natural outgrowth "" n nSo that's their play. They will overcharge the shit out of you under the guise of being organic, and good for the environment, and blah blah blah. n nHowever, upon my first and penultimate experience with this place, I learned that this was not the case. I brought in 5 dresses and 1 shirt to be dry cleaned before a trip abroad over Christmas. As I came to pick them up, they had 4 of my dresses and my shirt completed, and it cost over 70! These were not ornate, delicate, vintage, lacey dresses by any stretch of the word. Cute? Absolutely! But delicate to the point of over 15 per dress? I don't think so. n nIf you've been paying attention you'll realize that one of my dresses was not returned to me. That's because they damaged it. Somehow, they caused to deep purple top color to bleed all over the grey bottom half of my dress. And this is what they said to me ""Don't worry, this happens ALL THE TIME. It's a super easy fix! We just throw a bunch of CHEMICALS on it to remove the bled dye. "" n nHmmm, throw a bunch of ""chemicals "" on my dress to fix your errors after I am paying top dollar to have my belongings ""organically cleaned? "" Me thinks something is not adding up as it should. n nAnd this is the best part, after they damaged and treated my lycra polyester dress not fancy material in the slightest, when I came to pick it up, they had the gaul to charge me 12 for it. n nFool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.",1

"I have eaten in Outbacks, literally, all over the United States. Unfortunately, this one is closest to my home and I had a one star meal yesterday 07 25 14. Let me say, that I usually go here with a crowd. Yesterday, I had lunch, just me, after a business meeting.I took myself out. Was starving, in a great mood, and wanted Steak and Lobster. n nI sat in a bar booth. My waiter was an older woman with short white hair who tried to rush me, was prickly and EXTREMELY unfriendly and in a big rush. I was her only table and she was walking away while she asked what do I want to drink. She never brought my water She threw my salad in the bowl to serve it to me. Everyone else in other sections with different wait staff received normal looking salads, but whatever. I asked for dressing on the side.and it came on top. The AWFUL waitress surely was responsible. n nIt took 1 2 hour to get my meal after I noticed waiting after I just pecked at that boring salad. Then a table of three men came in and she was sweet to them, friendly and said ""thank you "" Worst wait staff experience. I only left a tip because I know bus people need it. too. n nSo the FOOD was only acceptable and NOT normal yummy like Outback. The steak was cooked properly, but tough and nowhere NEAR the flavorful steaks this chain really puts out. The very small lobster tail I ordered steamed was about 30 seconds under cooked, but I ate it and it was tasty. I had asked my waiter for my potato dressings on the side, but alas it was on top already, again what would she care? n nSo all this for my ""atta girl treat yourself special lunch for 35. Previously,about 3 months ago I was there and they had to re fire my steak TWICE to get it to medium rare. However, the staff has always been except for this little lunch of mine usually very nice. I mean why else would I stop in if I wasn't usually comfy there. After the last few meals, just in the ""meh had better "" range, considering the price, and now the hiring of a nasty white haired witch server? I'm done with this location.

Hikari is amazing! For my dad's birthday everyone except the baby did the all you can eat and that was a good decision. All of their sushi is really delicious. Except I cried because they were out of Takoyaki at 9pm. I definitely recommend doing the all you can eat. It's a great place for any kind of get together. The night before my parents actually attended a business meeting and stayed there until the wee hours of the morning. Or so I'm told.,2
I was disappointed with the menu as it was very generic. When the food came it tasted fine but just nothing memorable. I do have to give them credit as they served a large group but they added on appetizers without asking in hopes that we wouldn't notice.,1
Walked in after a 5 hour flight went to check in and they tell us the room isn't available so they had to downgrade us from a delux suite to a classic room for the night I've stayed in motor lodges with classier rooms than this patetic excuse for a room we finally get to the room and we find out its 15 for wifi. Went to the bar for drinks 2 margiritas 30 barely any tequila and all sour mix. The mini bar will bankrupt you. They also gave us a 50 credit because of the room mixup but apparently that 50 can't be used since every time we tried to use it we had to scream at the rude inconsiderate staff. I will not stay there again.,1
"The food was great, but the wait staff and management were by far the worst I've encountered. The simple task of splitting the check, was out of their grasp. 4 times and we finally got a bill that was accurate. Unfortunately we had to deal with the attitudes and the idiotic second grade math. Make sure you bring your calculator to double check the math.",1

"This place isn't for the poor.as in people with poor taste buds because this place is delicious! Seated within The Mirage on the Strip, Kokomo's is definitely an impressive, fine dining experience. Here's a link to the menu n nhttp www.mirage.com restaurants kokomos.aspx n nThe ambiance was very dark and quiet with music playing gently in the background. The waiter was extremely attentive without being annoying. The cranberry and bacon bread was amazing! I don't even like bread but this was something exquisite. My date ordered the Lobster Bisque Soup with a Puff Pastry Dome. It was definitely a larger portion than she anticipated but it certainly was amazing. I had a caesar salad with an egg less dressing and crisp parmesan cheese I held the anchovies . We both ordered the 8 oz fillet, oscar topped. Definitely the best steak I've had in long time. Not the best I've had but what's wrong with a close second. We also had Washington apple martinis as that was the drink on special. I can't remember how it's made but it certainly was unique and tasty. This place is a little pricey. Just two of us came to a little over 200 for what I described above but you're in Vegas, everything is a little pricey. I wouldn't pay that much for USDA prime anywhere else. For that price you can get certified Angus beef or even Kobe. n nOverall, this is a great dining experience if you're looking for something more classy and quiet to take your date too while your in Vegas. I'm sad to say that I just heard that Kokomo's will be closing effective January 13th, 2013. I guess I'll have to find a new fine dining experience when I go back.",2
"I'd totally be lying if I told you I didn't enjoy this. This show was AWESOME! Maybe it's because I've been reading 50 Shades of Grey, or maybe these guys just know how to work a room full of ladies. n nOf course I was with a bachelorette party and we were here for some fun. I actually wasn't even interested in going to this but it was in the itinerary and I'm not one to be a party pooper. We got there right when it was about to start so our seats were off to the side which ended up being a big bummer. WHY? Because the hot dudes only go in the middle. So, my advice. GET THERE EARLY. n nThese guys fickle with all the typical women's fantasies dressing up as firemen, cowboys, etc., seducing girls in the audience, and dancing their booties off, and yes. I saw a LOT of BOOTY! My only wish was that our party was sitting the main crowd and that the show was longer. I was totally sad when it was over because it all happened so fast and I was having a good time. completely SOBER, I might add. n nIf you're on a girl's trip, do it. It's awesome. Chippendale's is next on my list! Hahaha.",2
"This Hooters location has redeemed themselves via Cheyenne! She's an amazing bartender that really pays you the attention that any person in the industry should give you. n nWe sat at the bar, so I guess that's the key to having the service that you want, or any service at all. The food is still pretty much the same. n nI found it a bit refreshing that one of the managers contacted me, it's been awhile. I don't know, maybe I'm spoiled thanks to Yelp LOL but she didn't even offer me anything to even ""try "" and forget the horrific experiences we had in the past, oh well. n nAgain, thanks Cheyenne, you're amazing ",2
"The location would sell the place even if the food and beer were only OK. The former church is an amazing place to visit in its own right. n nFortunately, the beer and food stand up equally well and made for a tremendously enjoyable evening. n nWe were in town for a pre Christmas get away and went to CBW for dinner on a Wednesday night. n nWe feared the worst when we pulled into the side street and the their lot to see it quite full and figured that were in for a wait inside. Thankfully, our concerns were unfounded as the place was busy but not crowded. n nWe sat on the ""pub "" side to the left of the aisle. Our server arrived promptly with drink menus and quickly gave excellent descriptions of all of their seasonal beers. I go to a lot of brewery restaurants and one of my biggest peeves are servers who have no clue about the product that they are trying to sell. It was a pleasure to hear someone enthusiastically describe their beers. n nI settled on the Mexican Mole Stout. It was peppery and complex yet really balanced and enjoyable. It didn't feel ""contrived "" like many infused beers. After that, I went on to the barleywine ad have to say it was excellent as well with lots of alcohol warmth, complex malt tastes and very nice notes of the bourbon aging. n nMy wife enjoyed the SteamHammer very much. n nAs an appetizer, we couldn't turn down the fired risotto balls. They were a wonderful treat and I'm going to try to replicate this recipe. n nFor dinner we settled on the portabello mushroom pizza and it was equally good and adequately portioned. n nHighly recommended restaurant.",2
"Came in at 10 15 p.m. and was told that the wait will be 35 minutes. We got seated 10 minutes after. Under promised and over delivered. Perfect way to do business. n nWe came here for the Happy Hour. The amazing thing is that the ""appetizers "" here are nothing short of greatness. We got the classic sliders protein style , ahi poke, spicy tuna style 2 , calamari, chicken lettuce wrap, and ahi sashimi. n nThe sliders are similar to any other bar food. The ahi tuna, spicy tuna roll style was amazing. Presented beautifully as well. I think the portion of the calamari was huge for 6. The chicken lettuce wrap alone will hit all of your taste buds! Also, the sashimi here is amazing! I can't wait to arrive again! n nOur server was Bryan, and he got a great tip to accommodate his service!",2
"Xtreme Sushi is my favorite AYCE sushi spot in Vegas because you get tremendous service and consistent sushi. Does Xtreme have the highest quality fish and chefs with immaculate knife skills? Not really, but for 20 dollars you cannot go wrong with the value you get here. The hostess is incredibly nice and the chefs are attentive quick. I usually go for lunch and it doesn't really get too crazy on weekdays. Highly recommended",2
"Run from this buffet! The food looks like its been sitting there for weeks. You couldn't PAY me to eat the food. The only thing I can say is the staff is very nice and friendly. If you wanna make many trips to the bathroom , then is the food for u. Stick with taco bell. Its safer. Hey I dont want to be mean here, but its pretty hard to NOT lose your appetite while looking at the different selections of entrees. YELP! I must say we ate the rest of the time at the Victory club and the award winning mexican restaurant and they were fine.reasonable and the food was decent. The complete opposite. Stay away from the buffet unless you loose all your money in the casino and you are in need of food. Then and ONLY then would I even attempt to eat there. If you do, good luck and make sure you are near the bathroom the rest of the day!",1
"Kool and cooky place to hang, but love it! Great comic book selection, fantastic flames of war selection. Their bolt action needs help! Great terrain, the only down side is being your own munchies, drinks are a hit and a miss!",2
"Pretty good. The food was great, the service was fanstastic, and overall it was a great experience. My only complaint is the seating in this place. We went in a dull period so we got a table quickly, but at a busy lunch time period, I cannot imagine trying to find a place to sit. I see they are opening a new location near my home in southwest soon and it appears to be a little bigger. So that might take this joint from a 4 to 5 star. I have the Merica breakfast from the Happy side of the menu. It was fanfreakingtastic. I would definitely recommend this place. My co worker loves their juices. The best part about this place is there are too sides of the menu a Happy side with comfort food galore and a Healthy side if you are looking for something more healthy. Definitely worth a visit, i know I will be back.",2
"Came here based on the decent Yelp reviews and my reaction to the images. nIt's a nice looking place, spacious, with a lot of tables and a good number of staff on hand. Very business friendly, good for an after work cocktail or a casual business meeting over a meal not exactly a romantic hot spot or a place to go for a drink ""with the lads "". nI had the lobster it was flavourless, overly chewy and served with surprisingly sloppy pasta. Extremely disappointing. nSure there are slim waitresses with unnaturally long legs parading about in tiny shorts, but that won't improve the taste or quality of the meal. nThe cocktails were pretty good however. n nAll in all, not worth the money.",1
"An insanely kind and knowledgeable staff, combined with a massive menu and a serene ambiance leads to a consistently pleasant experience at Dobra Tea. n nSeating ranges from tables for two to pillow filled platforms that are great for small to medium sized groups. The chairs and platforms don't quite stand up to other caffeinated beverage houses in the area on the comfort scale, but aren't so bad as to be uninviting. n nMy personal favorite is the chilled rooibos shaken with honey, and the hot chai is also really tasty. In the five or six times I've been there, everyone's always been pleased with their drink and the service. The only complaint has been about the custom of ringing a bell at your table for service though it's nice to have time to peruse the menu and figure out what you want at your leisure, summoning the staff with a bell feels too much like calling for a servant. n nOn a bit of a side note, a special thanks to the lovely staff for never kicking us out, despite our inevitably inappropriate conversations and bursts of zen breaking laughter.",2
"this place is nice i like how full it is and the live band. they have 5 table and you can stay there all night, I did not like the pong beer game but, just dont play. that game is nasty. all the table were not full but the place was full enough for me.",2
THEE BEST! n nAustin You ROCK!,2
What a mess. n nLuckily we ended up getting a table and having a private area and bottle service which was fine. BUT. the hour before that happened was a nightmare. This place is ran so poorly compared to the 10 other nightclubs I've been to in Vegas. n nThe music is 90 hip hop and the crowd is much older and trashier. So many people were here in khakis shorts and flip lops. We were confused. n nThis establishment will never be a stable in the nightclub world like many of the others are and I will not be back!,1
"This is only a review for the free shuttle from Rio to Ballys. I know it sounds lame to rate something that was free but it's been bothering me. n nI went to meet up with my friend who was staying at the Rio so we can hang out. Unfortunately I valeted my car because I thought we were just going to meet up for dinner inside the hotel. She remembered that the hotel offers a free shuttle to the strip so we chose to do that. n nWhen the shuttle drove up we noticed everyone scurrying to find their card. We thought they needed a room key to prove that we were staying at the hotel. My friend shows the driver her room key and he says , ""I don't need that .that ain't nothin "" he scoffed. I need to see your Diamond card. The Diamond card members are allowed to go first. She was no longer a Diamond Club member so she didn't have one. We were the last ones to board . I thought the issue had passed but the driver made another comment about the card. My friend was clearly already agitated so she said, ""Thanks for telling us because we we didn't know "". Then he sarcastically said ""Then now you know "". n nMy friend was livid by the time she left the shuttle so she filed a formal complaint with the hotel. She told the management that it's wrong to treat people based on their player club status. She was a Diamond member once but now that she's not the hotel shouldn't look down on her. She was mainly embarrassed because this happened in front of a lot of people.",1
"My God. nThere's no better fried chicken on this planet. n nI ran into Adam from ""Man Vs. Food "" downtown a couple of months ago and after shaking his hand, I told him the show MUST profile Price's Chicken Coop. I didn't get to ask what restaurants they were filming. n nBest bet is the 1 4 white dinner or the 4 wing dinner. You get too much food packed away in a grease stained now that's love cardboard box. Tater tots, hush puppies, slaw, and a roll. I'm not a big slaw fan so they substitute mine for more pups. Why a roll AND hush puppies, you might ask? Take out the meat of the breast and put it in the roll for a quick sammich. BEWARE They're a bit stingy on the condiments and napkins. I have tried to enjoy other things on the menu and was gravely disappointed. Fish and bbq are very average, IMO. There's a reason that ""chicken "" is prominent in this restaurant's name, dammit. If you get a chicken sandwich, prepare to have it bones and all. It's a hot, greasy mess peeling the meat off of the bone and putting it in the bread, but it's well worth it. AWESOME sweet tea.so good they'll charge you more without ice! Dinky cups, too.might wanna buy 2.hey, that rhymes! n nThis place is a hole in the wall, I will not lie to you. I can appreciate it for it's ""charm "" but this place has to make money hand over fist. Where does it all go? I'd love to be a long lost relative and inherit the mother lode. The doors only swing inward which makes it a pain in the entering if it's crowded and exiting if your hands are full. There's no seats. It's strictly carry out. Cash ATM inside and carry only. There's a parking lot out back with plenty of trash cans. Worth it, if there's no panhandlers around. They've actually scared them away for the most part, but every rare once in a while you'll be greeted. n nYour pal, nWalter",2
"A friend of ours introduced us to Tin Tin last summer and we've been a few times most recently yesterday . We were appropriately prepped about the long lines and have only been to Tin Tin on weekends for dinner right as it opens. And other than Rusan's I haven't been to any other buffets in Charlotte, so I don't have much to compare it to. n nThe selections are pretty standard Chinese buffet selections. Standard soups, fried rice, various chicken and beef dishes, and some seafood. We usually come here for the snow crab legs and the blue crabs, and the shrimp. Unfortunately they didn't have blue crabs yesterday, but the previous other times that we went, they had them and we liked them. The oysters were a bit disappointing yesterday, but in the past they've been alright. n nThe service is alright. Some servers were more attentive than others. Some would clear our plates a little earlier than they probably should have, but that's not a big deal to me. n nI did notice that their sushi is pretty good, and they have various steamed buns, peking duck, made to order noodle soups, and even have ventured into a couple more ""fusiony "" dishes. I did get to sample a little of that, and they did not disappoint. n nOverall we're pretty satisfied with Tin Tin. Again, we're not big on buffets in general, but when we're in the mood for crab legs and shrimp this is our place. And it's great because the standard buffet selections look pretty good too. Variety is good. I'd recommend it here.",2

"The bargain rates at Luxor right now are no bargain when you consider how beat down the property is. We got a 70 night rate but ended up in a pyramid room. Yuck! The carpet was very dirty and snagged, the hall carpeting has been cleaned so many times it is stretched and wrinkled and the pyramid common areas and casino are pretty dated. The pool area also doesn't stack up to other properties. The bedding was downright horrible surely this is something that could be upgraded without rehabbing the rooms. Having said that, the staff was uncommonly nice it's clear that they are trying hard. Still, next time in Vegas, I'll pay 30 more and stay at a nice property.",1
"WORST SERVICE EVER! n I'm a a local and I work in the restaurant industry as well, so I know how service works. I came after watching a movie with my family and since I've only been here once with my husband for a late night dinner, we enjoyed it. As soon as we come in the door the host just points his finger to the host at the end of the restaurant meaning ""go to her she will sit you "" or so I think. We go and the hosts takes us to the booth . As we sat down he took our drink selections right away with a pretty emotionless face no smile no ""hello, how are we today "", nothing. So we did take about 5 minutes to order since it is a rather big menu selection, so we let the server know we still needed a few. more minutes to decide. I guess the server Marlon decided to take quite a long time to come back to us since we ended up waiting about 10 15minutes. When he finally did, we ordered and he acted with a careless attitude and said ""OK "" and left. OK, that's fine I guess. Then the food took quite a long time, we were planning on leaving since the server was careless and everything seemed to be taking ages to come. But we didn't, we gave it another shot. My mother really didn't like the water soo much so she wanted a raspberry ice t so when Marlon came walking by we asked him for one. Never came with one so we asked the young lady who refills the drinks to bring us one. She finally did with a smile as well. Finally when the food came at last, we eagerly ate with satisfaction that made me a litter happier. So then we don't find the server Marlon for about 20 minutes and my nephew and brother wanted ketchup and soy sauce ,we waited to see if he was ever going to show up again, he didn't,. what a surprise. So I saw the manager and waved her down to see if SHE can bring the condiments to us she said ""Of course "" with a smile. I thank her for that ! we finally ate in peace and Marlon came at the end of it all and we asked for boxes, he came quickly with those! And we got the check and went to go pay. Thinking that was the worst ever, I was wrong! The cashier was the rudest. When I asked her politely if she can split the check, she said 'yeah "" with a rude attitude. WHATEVER I thought! Then as we signed the receipts I thought why tip, but MARLON was lucky to EVEN get a penny FROM ME, but I gave him a dollar ANYWAYS because his quality of service was just that of a dollar. So as the cashier asked if we wanted our copies we said yes. And she gave me mine, then My mom didn't see her copy so she went back to her to ask for it POLITELY the rude ass lady slammed her hand on the copy and said ""HERE "". I'm sorry but if you don't have time to have a smile and manners to be in the service industry no matter how old you are you should QUIT and go elsewhere. I put up with the rudest people at my job but yet I have respect for anyone who has the decency to smile and act polite! My family and I didn't deserve such shitty service, no one does! THANKS for nothing!",1

"Let me just start out by saying, this is NOT the review I would like to be writing. I'll admit, this is not my first time here but it certainly will be my last. I live basically hop, skip, and a jump away and this would be way too convenient for my ultimate craving which, yes, happens daily I stopped in for dinner around 7 30 and there is one cheese pizza sitting under the lamp for god knows how long. From a previous trip I remember there being about 6 7 specialty pizzas ready to take a slice and be on your way. Specialty pizzas are my thing. You would NEVER, I repeat NEVER, catch me ordering a cheese or even pepperoni pizza. There is just way more to life than to be plain Jane like that! So the dull toned lady tells me that it's 2.50 slice and an additional 0.50 topping. I should have to just politely said no thank you but I was set on pizza for dinner so I ordered chicken, spinach and mushrooms which the man takes the cheese slice that had been under the lamp for unsaid amount of time, adds the topping and puts in back in the oven. I will eat pizza hot, cold, reheated, etc but to have my pizza cooked a second time as I'm ordering it is just not my idea of deliciousness! So if I cant finish it, I am then triple heating my pizza?!? No thank you! Customer service was not there. Reheated, over priced pizza. Like I said, I really wanted to like, or love, this place but that's just not the case. I guess I'll be heading to the grocery store for a whole frozen pizza for about the same price and about 100000x more satisfaction! Sigh!",1
"Taking this time at 7 in the morning to say that I'm very disappointed with their customer service. Their cashier, Donna, needs a little more orientation time to say the least.

Maybe a desk job hidden away from people would better suit her. n nHappy Monday!",1
"It's surprisingly difficult to find places that deliver in Vegas. Everyone in the office is completely sick of Jason's Deli 3 days in a row, so we tried something different and so glad we did. I've only had the Thai food from Kung Fu, but it's one of the few places in Chinatown that delivers, and figured we'd give their food a try. n nWe did the order by phone since it was catering, but I was really surprised that their website allows you to do the order online for delivery or pick up. Helps a lot with the language barrier I don't speak Chinese or Thai, but my coworker made me order in English! because she had trouble understanding them. n nWe were able to feed 12 14 people for about 160 which is really good. Delivery was on time and there was no minimum or delivery fee. I wasn't blown away by the Chinese food, but it was above average with generous servings at a really reasonable price. I think each half pan was around 40. n nIt's not my personal go to for Chinese or Thai, but the fact that they're cheap, so close to the strip and have delivery makes this place 5 star if you're visiting. Beats paying 25 for sweet sour chicken from a casino restaurant.",2

"A smaller Chili's stuffed into the food court at Concord Mills mall, my wife, daughter, granddaughter and I stopped in for a bite to eat while out Christmas shopping. nThe food here is fair at best and not worth the price. I got a Buffalo chicken sandwich which was a breaded, formed chicken patty, not a grilled chicken breast, with very little bleu cheese or buffalo sauce and neither one had much flavor that I paid 8 for with a side of fries which was better than the sandwich. nMy wife was not informed the soup she ordered they were out of until she ordered even though it was still on the menu. She settle for a grilled chicken salad which said was just ok. My granddaughters mac and cheese looked like, and according to my daughter, tasted like a 50 cent box of Kraft mac and cheese from the grocery store and they charged 5 for that with a vegetable side! nMy daughter said her chicken enchilada soup was good, but a small bowl of soup with a small side salad was 8. . nIt was not that busy for us to have to wait over 30 minutes for our food and service was just ok. The wait, food quality and service was no where near worth the 38 we paid. nIf you choose any other place in the food court to eat, you would come out better than eating here.",1
"Their food was bomb. Every single thing I've tried from their menu is really good! Italian food and even happy hour items. Bartenders are really friendly, place has a homey vibe which I always like.

"It might just be that we didn't order the right stuff or that they have Americanized too much. My short impression is that the food was bland and pretty dull. My wife ordered the Tacitos and while these are usually bland by design, it's the dipping sauce that gives them life and the Avacado sauce was disappointing as an over whipped Avacado. My daughter at the age of two is an incredible fan of Mexican Rice and Beans and she wouldn't touch them here, she only ate the chips and salsa, which admittingly and disappointingly was the high life of the mean. I had the most order Pollo Fundido, the chicken while all white meat was extremely bland, the only thing that saved this dish was the jalapeno cheese sauce on top. It actually had life and would make a great Con Queso dip in it's own rights. I would like to see the meat livened up with a little jalapeno and salsa. Show me the food I would see when visiting friends having a Fiesta, I know it's there, let it out and show your full potential as a Mexican resturant.",1
"Since all good Chinese food places are closed on Sundays, we tried, hopeful, to have some good Chinese food from this place, and was sadly disappointed. Service was was nice and fast for delivery, which is the what the one star is for, and that is all the good things I have to say. I ordered a chicken dish, crab puffs, and a few other full dishes and all had one similarity.they were all bland and full of vegetables. The crab puffs had the smallest amount of filling inside, with a large gap of what should be full of said filling, and overall, the taste was this fried, oily, wonton wrap. The chicken dish I ordered had maybe 2 oz. of chicken, thigh and leg meat only with fat skin still on it and this grey tint that was just unappetizing , and did I say I've never felt like more of a vegan until this meal? Because of the overwhelming amount of vegetables? nothing against vegans or any one who diets, I eat it all . I'd love to have a Sunday Asian food restaurant I order from, and be satisfied with what I get, but this is not that place. I am only one person, but Good luck to you Lucky Kitchen in your future business.",1
"This is my go to Friday lunch when I'm working at home. The gyros are huge and a solid deal at 5. The lamb is standard and the chicken is breaded which is a little odd. The sauce is heavy on the dill which makes the gyro. n nThe hummus is worthy of 5 stars. Always solid and lots of flavors to choose from.

"Not going to lie, I was a little tempted to order this 60 Rossini burger that was on the menu just to say that I've had it. Unfortunately, it sounded too heavy before a night out on the town and drinking, so I opted out. n nThis is located in the strip mall at Mandalay Bay. I've walked by several times, but had never been in. While you're waiting, they have a free photobooth outside to take some photos. You can either social media tag them or e mail to yourself. Cool little perk and makes the time go by faster before you're seated. I'm sure there are some great photos as the drunks come rolling through. n nA full bar is available and they have a ton of beers to choose from and there are various televisions on different sporting events if you're into that sort of thing. n nWhat I tried nI created my own burger with the Australian Kobe beef with a ciabatta bun, spinach, swiss, fried egg, tomato, and chipotle aioli. This was served with skinny fries that were thin and crispy, just the way I like 'em. The burger itself wasn't everything that I had hoped for. As you know, I feel like I suck when it comes to building my own masterpieces, so I usually opt out. I should have stuck to my own habits and done so again. n nI don't think that the spinach necessarily worked on the burger. It was saut u00e9ed but really watery making the rest of the burger super moist. I order the meat cooked medium and the combo of spinach and medium meat juices didn't really blend well. To be perfectly honest, I couldn't tell that the beef was that much better than the normal patties that my friends had in their sliders. Next time I will opt for the black angus beef and save myself 8. But at least I can say that I tried it. n nI snuck some onion rings off of my friend's plate. They were pretty damn delicious. The onion was sweet inside and the outside was crispy and airy. They stayed crispy throughout the whole meal and I was tempted to order a second round. I was too stuffed, and that weird burger combo kinda gave me a stomach ache. Again, not their fault, I chose the flavors. n nService was good and everything came out fast. Our server was patient with some of my drunk table mates I'm sure they get a lot of the crazy banter all the time. n nI wish I would have tried one of their desserts. They have a good variety of shakes both alcoholic and non alcoholic and something called a chocolate burger. n nI would come back and try one of their other burgers and will sub for a side of onion rings. This place is more expensive than a typical restaurant, but it's expected since it's inside a hotel on the strip. Live a little.",2
"Okay I know I never write reviews about chain restaurants but for Golden Corral, I'll make an exception. n nI am writing this review for 3 reasons n n1. Southern California does have any Golden Corrals, so this is an entirely new experience. n2. Every time I drove by, there is a line out the door so it must be good right? n3.

I think people we're all headed the same place, why be rude? n nIt's around 12 per person, which is a good price. n nSo we finally get in and the place is filled to capacity. I scanned all the offerings and I gotta say there wasn't much. They had an extensive dessert area but I was more interested in what I was having for dinner. Off the top of my head, here is what I saw n n1. Popcorn shrimp n2. Fried Fish n3. Steak fries n4. Pizza n5. Meatloaf n6. Pasta n7. Ribs n8. Ham n9. Salad bar n nIt was okay quality. The popular stuff was often left empty. I tried some of the things I listed and it was okay tasting after having to fight with rude folks cutting in line or just hogging everything. n nI guess what people really like here is that they offer steak and its supposedly cooked to your desired temperature which it wasn't . The portions given were about 1 inch by 3 inch rectangular piece. I know it's hard to satisfy the masses but having to get up multiple times to piece together a steak got annoying. n nThe staff was actually really nice. I really don't know how they deal with the crazy, rude and greedy clientele. I think I'd have a headache each and every day I worked there. n nAll in all, it wasn't worth the wait. It's similar to Hometown buffet. I'd rather just go to some cheap Chinese buffet locally.",1
"Burger Bar. This place is RIDICULOUS. The last time I went there I ordered the Kobe beef burger. That was hands down, the most delicious and juicy burger ever consumed by my mouth. Yes, it was expensive. It was about 16 but it was well worth the price of admission. The burger came with all the fixings as well as a giant portion of fries and a pickle quarter. n nThe next time I stop at the Mandalay, I'm heading straight to the Bar.",2
Closed!,1
The nachos do look amazing but their burgers suck. Not 15 worth. You can get a better burger at Dennys. The atmosphere is fun especially if drinking. Would come back to try the nachos but not anything else.,1
"Gross.Without boring you with details, well, it's just not worth the walk up the stairs.The 3 of us sat outside and ordered from the blonde with an accent that didn't have a nametag, nor did she give us her name, ever. The caesar salad first bite was so bad I wanted to vomit. Old, wilted, rancid and soggy. I ordered tomato soup instead. It was so so. My husbands burger was ""fine "" he said. My son's pulled pork was topped with cole slaw and we couldn't find the meat. The bun was non exist because it deteriorated to nothing from the watery cole slaw. fries with both were cold. The manager tried to make it better with the rancid salad but the worst part of this total eating experience was the security alarm of the restaurant next door that was piercing my ears going off for true story 25 minutes. I was going to shoot someone. The check took over 20 minutes to get to us after we asked for it. That was longer than it took to get our food. We will not go back. Once again, not worth my efforts of walking up those stairs. nGood luck if you try this joint.",1
"Le Petit Hotel is a boutique hotel located on one of the very narrow streets of Old Montreal. With plenty to do and plenty to see in Montreal this was a very convenient location for seeing Old Montreal and the Old Port. It is in walking distance from all the activities in that area and two blocks from the Notre Dame Basilica. n nThere are four floors in the hotel and the rooms are not that large. My room was all hard wood floors, which was very unique. The room was extremely clean and even had a spot for you to take your shoes off when you got in the room. The bed was also very comfortable. The bathroom wasn't particularly large, but once again, cleanliness is key and that it was. There is just a stand up shower. n nStaff was very friendly and were very willing to help. Breakfast is served in the morning. Choice of specialty coffee or orange juice. Breakfast spread includes cereal, croissants, chocolate croissants, cinnamon raisin bread, and a fruit salad. n nMy recommendation is that if you are looking for the Montreal nightlife to stay more in the downtown area near st. catherine's or crescent streets. This area is pretty dead at night in terms of bars. There are plenty of restaurants though.",2
"I'm not really sure what to think of Cookie to be honest, from the outside everything looks like one off pieces so I wasn't sure if it was a second hand shop or not. When I went in for a browse I realised they didn't just have one off pieces but the clothes still looked second hand for some reason. they just looked misshapen like they'd all been worn before. I did notice a few nice dresses with some floral prints but they were about the only pieces of clothing that tickled my fancy. n nI think their accessories are a lot nicer than the clothes and I saw some cute scarves and purses which would be great as gifts. n nI don't know. the stuff here just seems really bland and a little bit overpriced too.",1
"Sometimes I wish I lived in Las Vegas just so I could come here for breakfast regularly. Keep in mind this place is off strip so you need to drive, but the menu and prices are awesome! Also, be prepared for a wait and keep in mind it's easier to get a table for 2 than for a larger group. n nMy two favorite dishes are the red velvet pancakes and the adobo fried rice. I've tried other pancakes here, but the red velvet are the best BY FAR. They even come with a side of cream cheese syrup. It's like having dessert for breakfast! The adobo fried rice comes wrapped in an omelet and is awesome! n nI've also tried the spinach eggs benedict which is very tasty. It comes with a side of buttery hash browns. I will definitely be tryng the kalua pork benedict next time. The spam scramble sounded interesting, but was nothing special. The french toast is also not very good. Take my advice and try my two favorite dishes to make the trip worth it.",2
"This place is tiny. We were so excited to sing karaoke. Then we found out it would be 1 1 2 hours, before it would be our turn! And there weren't many people there. What a dissapointment.",1
"Great night based off previous Yelpers! We are out of towners looking for a great tapas place in the Scottsdale area and Tapas Papas Frita popped up. We got a great seat outside on the patio facing the common area which had a band and was great ambiance. Service was quick, friendly and authentic! We enjoyed some great tapas starters before sharing the signature paella.which was fantastic! We washed it all down with some wonderful white wine sangria. Would definitely return if we could and maybe sit inside to enjoy the flamenco dancing and music.",2
"Fans of Snow Ono Shave Ice rejoice. The bus is back! n nPlease see http www.yelp.com biz snow ono shave ice las vegas 2 n nIt's great to see some cool owners pick up where Marianne left off. The ice is just as fluffy and the flavors just as delicious. Today was only a small preview event, so the full complement of syrups wasn't there. Honestly, I was always overwhelmed by Snow Ono's myriad choices, so it was a welcome sight. But I'll be just as happy when some of the faves return. n nOne of the main reasons Snow Ono did so well was because of their excellent customer service. From what I witnessed today, it looks like Cherie and her family are keeping that spirit alive. Silky smooth shave ice served with a smile.",2
Mostly old fashioned clothing but nice decor above average service,1
"Today was my third time eating something from Szmidt's, and it keeps getting better. From a plain turkey or tuna salad sandwich, to what is probably the best chicken salad I've ever had mango and feta everything is so fresh and delicious. My husband has tried the Sanchez rage, which is ridiculous but amazing, and absolutely loved it. The bread is to die for as well! Fresh, thick slices of homemade rye bread, or homemade white rolls. I'm kind of concerned that this is literally at the end of my street. I will probably be there way too often.",2
"I have now eaten here twice. The last time i ordered pad thai. I will say no matter what spice level you say, it still comes out not that hot. The food is pedestrian. Nothing special. It's not bad, and is quite edible. The pad thai was a little bland for me. It kind of just tasted like slightly fishy noodles. I ordered the veggie pad thai and the second time the chicken pad thai. Both tasted exactly the same. I've had way worse. I've also eaten way better. Don't let the two stars fool you, I'd eat there again in a pinch and the staff is quite friendly.",1
"This place is absolutely amazing! If you're looking for tasty, authentic Indian cuisine this is the place to try. We had the chicken tikka masala which was amazing, the salad with tandoori chicken, na'an bread and the chicken tandoori. Every single dish was absolutely amazing, the whole family agreed on 5 stars. There were multiple people coming around to refill drinks and get you anything else you may need, the owner came by multiple times to make sure everything was great, just as he promised it would be. This is a must try for people just visting from out of town or the locals, just east of the strip Las Vegas Blvd .",2
"Two star rating is for the cheap ""seats "" on the grass and the 20 parking at a nearby hotel. Wet grass, people who couldn'tcare less about baseball but did love their monster beer cups, more pickup action than a Tempe campus bar on a Friday night and the longest bathroom lines ever seen in a small stadium. n nElsewhere, the parts of the stadium with real seats did look nice, the fans polite if not too involved in the game, and the food selections were interesting. n nWho knew that everyone in the area was a Giants fan like us? Saw one outcast wearing a blue jersey for whatever team beat the Giants 16 2. n nNext time, try to get into the website earlier to get real seats!",1
"I am pretty sure this place is now closed. but before they closed, David and I went in to find a sweet treat after we had eaten dinner elsewhere. We were quite disappointed with the selection of desserts and beverages.plus the server didn't really seem interested in serving us. so after checking out their menu and what they had in their display cases, we decided to head over to D'Vine Wine instead.",1
"Beware of the new 25 ""guest fee "" they tack on now on top of the 11 booking fee. Told it was a new corporate policy they started last summer for all the Las Vegas hotels in the Harrahs chain. The hotel and rooms are very nice but i can't stand the feeling of being ripped off by yet another corporate scheme to make money.",1
"Three words Duck Fat Fries! Dear lawd. They are heaven! And they were on the happy hour menu. Me and the girls met up with another friend and one of my friends sister to catch up and we picked STRIPSTEAK. We also order the Lobster Grilled Cheese with tomato soup, crabcakes, onion rings, truffled mac and cheese, and scalloped potatoes with goat cheese and caramelized onions. Yes it seems like alot of food but there were 5 of us and we had also had a few cocktails so we were hungry. Believe me, they were all DIVINE! I cannot wait to get the chance to go back and have dinner because I know that that will be a treat in itself.",2
"Had the onion burger. Was great. Well cooked. Coffee wasnt great or bad. Fries were fantastic blend of waffle, straw crickle, Maybe more, with some tasy seasoning on top. n n nAlso they take ur cell number when they r busy and text u and give u ten minutes to claim ur seats. So you can go enjoy the casino.",2
Will never give my business to Americas Best again! I don't know why make an appointment with these people. I'm writing this at 2 25 pm and still haven't seen the doctor. I've been here since my scheduled appointment at 12 00 pm. 2.5 hours later and still haven't been seen is absolutely ridiculous. I've been a client of lens crafters for over a decade and I made a poor decision to come here. When I have an appointment at Lens crafters I'm in and out in 30 minutes. n nJust about to leave this place. I did want to mention and this is very important since I will be going on 3 hours wait time. America's Best has Americas WORST waiting seats constructed of hard perforated steel. Couldn't put some padding in your seats at the very lease if your gonna make scheduled clients or x clients wait 3 hours. Horrific! Would be the word that comes to mind about Americas Best. You guys really need to put forth more effort into scheduling efforts. Shame Shame n nAlso Shame they delete customers reviews. Funny not one revie and the business has been open for quite some time. I just noticed they deleted this review so I am editing every week and making sure this on there!,1
"It is so colorful here and nicely arranged. The Boulevard carries creative art that would go great in any modern home. The styles are very diverse, they carry blown glass, paintings, candles, hand crafted jewelry, and art crafted from wood. I feel like I am leaving something out, but there are just so many different kinds of home decor here. n nI really loved the owner's taste, the only qualm I have is that none of it is really by local artists. Some is imported from Europe a lot of the glasswork , and I believe most of the woodwork is fair trade art. n nThe clerk seemed like she was only really interested in people who looked like they could afford to buy something, and this is understandable, I mean it is a business. I was just window shopping, I won't lie. Although I did love the watercolor painting of what looked like the Lion of Judah I may come back and pick that up, so don't buy it, haha. n nI thought that setting the stores on several levels was interesting and it helped to keep the similar art forms together. Too many of these places close at five, this one closes at seven, so its a good venture after work.",2
"Definitely a great Sunday brunch spot.the bad part is they usually have an hour wait at 10am when I went. n nThe French Toast is the best I ever had.its not Texas sized toast its more like Alaska sized cinnamon toast. n nMy only real downside from being a 5 star place is a plate of French Toast is filling however i would have probably preffered 2 toast instead of 3 and it comes with a small 2 egg omlette.now that would be a perfect combo. or even a smaller omlette, a french toast and some bacon or sausage. n nThey should add those kinds of deals for like 8.99 or 9.99. n nDefinately better than AZ Bread, Crackers.and the franchises like Good Egg, Denny's, IHOP, Waffle House. n nI'm still waiting to try matt's big breakfast.",2
The worst service ever! They told me a prescription wool be ready in 2 hours and I am still waiting and it has been 3 hours now. They have messed up with so many customers.,1
"I was never a big fan of chicken wings. nI know. I know. blasphemous. but all of that nchanged when I was introduced to Wingstop. nTheir lemon pepper is hands down the best in the ncity. nIve tried other peoples wings and theirs are usually ntoo big to enjoy, we've all seen em. the wings that are as nbig as breasts. yeah Im not a fan. or too soft. nI prefer my wings crisp. nAnd wingstop fulfills all my needs. bite sized and ncrispy skin. Delicious from head to toe. nI will absolutely be back. !",2
"Went here with my brother 2 nights in a row. The best part was that it was FREE if you were a guest at the hotel. If you are not it's probably 30. I think Pure and JET are overall better clubs but I stil had fun here. There were a lot of people and it was crowded, but it looked like most people were having fun. Expect to pay 10 15 a drink. It's worth going if you can go for free. I think you can also go for free if you sign up for the guest list the night before. If you are not with a group of hot girls and you're a guy then you maybe waiting around to get called in, but eventually you will get in if you're patient.",2
Nice staff.Dirty. There was fecal matter on my shower curtin. Cleanliness is not a priority here. Hotwire is the reason for all my problems. I will never do name your own price.,1
"My favorite donut place! I buy two dozen once a week for my workplace at around 8pm and once at 2am and they are always fresh and delicious! They are open 24 hours which is convenient for my work hours. They always give me at least 14 to a dozen! Co workers say they are the best donuts they've had in a long time! They are quality, old fashion style made donuts and they have a larger selection of types than I've seen at most donut places. They are also on the large side, especially the buttermilk bars! No one can resist them when they see them!",2
"The bad n Nobody at the door to greet or seat us. n The waitress sat down at our table and read the specialty drinks to us off the menu. n The host had to hold a flashlight for the waitress while she was reading the menu to us, as the lights were so low she couldn't see it. Seriously. A flashlight. n 2 for 1 drink coupon was not good on specialty drinks. n The waitress did not tell us our coupon wasn't good on specialty drinks until after delivering the drinks. n No restrictions are listed on the 2 for 1 coupon. n When I pointed all this out to the waitress, she just said ""Oh. "" n No effort was made to turn this into a better experience. n 50 for 2 cocktails is way too expensive! n nThe good n Ummmmm. n Hmmmmm. n I can't think of anything. My friend's drink was good. Mine was mediocre. n nThe bottom line nI'm never going back here again. I feel ripped off, and no effort was made by the waitress or anyone else to try to save the situation. I'm going to tell everyone I know how bad the service was that I received here.",1
i love this place! i love tori and get my eyebrows threaded every two weeks! easy to call and schedule appaointments and i'm always in and out no lne waits! i recommend for the best service! n ni have gotten two masaages here and they where well worth it and only 30 bucks! can't beat that!,2
great atmosphere 100 rock n roll. good service unless it's really busy! lots of seating mostly booths. a large circular bar lots of tv's playing music videos. the burgers are the best sround.seasoned cooked perfectly huge! a little pricy 2 people can eat for 50. we enjoy the burgers of course the 8 chocolate shakes! a must if you are visiting.,2
good size dnace floor but crowd was not impressive at all. n ntechno music most of the night. fri dj ikonic. ndrinks were pricey and dinky! the shot they gave was in a plastic dixie like cup! 16! n nwould not go again!,1
"I can't imagine too many people turning to a review site before heading to a well known fast food place like Panda Express, but just in case on that off chance someone is looking, here goes! n nFood It's all cookie cutter style food prep that being said, this location even managed to mess this up. I love love love pot stickers!, I buy them at any Asian joint I go to, make them at home. I have DREAMS of gyoza dipping itself in fresh ponzu sauce and feeding itself to me, because I love them so much! well, maybe not that far, but almost. However, this is the first time I have eaten what equates to a Gag Rubber Gyoza. It was sadness for the tummy. I couldn't even pawn off the rubbery ""treats "" to my German Shepard. She just sniffed it and gave me the stink eye like I was trying to poison her with them. n nCustomer Service I have said this before and I will stand by it every time I don't expect 5 star service from a fast food joint. I understand these are minimum wage employees who more than likely die a little inside every time the put their uniform on in the morning. I get that this job will not be the one they fondly remember as ""the good ole days "". That being said, don't make me feel that way too please! I don't want to feel like the life is being sucked out of me because of the Eeyore atmosphere. n nPrice WOW, I remember when it was actually cheap to eat here. For 2 people, with 2 item combos, and portions smaller than they used to be, it came to more than 18! I could have gone to one of those mom and pop Chinese shops, got the lunch special with soup, egg roll, and bigger entree portions for less. And the food didnt even taste fresh. It definitely was NOT worth the cost and lack of atmosphere.",1
My husband and I recently stayed the first week of November. when i called to make the reservation i specifically asked if there were many conventions and they said no. The hotel had many conventions and few leisure travelers. The gym was overcrowded at 7 00am and very small for the amount of users. The bathroom in the gym was very dirty and disgusting. I had to tell someone to clean it. The Spa on the otherhand was very clean and I had a nice stone massage. The restaurant is very nice and the help friendly and accommodating. But the hotel is very commercial for business guests and does not offer personal service. I would try another 5 star resort the next time.,2
Worst service ever. You'd have better luck getting somewhere by standing in the line for magic mountain at Disneyland.,1
Sushi here is A come here during happy hour though that's when you'll get the best value for your dollar! Plus the happy hour menu is awesome.,2
"I got a pedicure here. Not bad, they were pretty thorough. But two days later both of my big toes were infected and oozing pus where she trimmed my toenails on the sides which was weird anyway . I hate to rate a local shop down, but man my toes hurt.",1
"They have pretty decent and authentic Mexican food. Pretty large menu so lots of options. I bit on the pricey side, but they make up for it by having 99 cent margaritas on Wednesdays.",2
"If you're into pinball at all, this place is amazing. It's a big room filled with pinball machines from all eras, along with a few assorted video games Paperboy! Tetris! It's free to get in, and you just pay 25 75 cents depending on the game. I brought five dollars in quarters and was entertained for quite awhile. n nOn a related note, I wish I had 950 to blow and more space because they were selling a Ted Nugent pinball game there for that price, and you know that'd be an awesome conversation piece. Whenever someone would go into my house, it would go something like this n nPerson ""Um, why do you have a Ted Nugent pinball game? "" n nMe ""It's the NUGE! "" n nPerson ""Okay. "" n nBut I digress. Anyway, if you're in Vegas, you should check this place out. It's only a couple of miles off the strip.",2
"Saw this new place at the Biltmore and wandered in, having no idea it was 'yet another Sam Fox concept.' Oy. Yes, the atmosphere is fine, and the people are pretty, and the dishes are acceptable, but. Why oh Why must the employees there be robots, automatons blindly following the company script? The server helping us must have been so new, or terrified of losing his job, that he was incapable of relying on any part of his authentic self. He was obviously told what to say to us upon approaching the table the dreaded ""Have you been here before? "" , what to say upon 'walking us through the menu' I have only read a menu like this 10,000 times before , what to say upon bringing each item to the table thanks, I know what 'street' tacos look like , etc. What does Mr. Fox fear? That his employees may have a personality that may ring true to diners? That we may accidentally have a genuine interpersonal interaction, if even for 30 seconds? And it wasn't just the server. We got the same from the hostess and the manager too. It's enough to make you lose your appetite. I'm outta here. No more Sam Fox for me.",1
"Oh Brio, I wish I met your happy hour sooner. n nFor your dining pleasure during M F, 3 to 7 M Th 9 to close , TUSCAN TASTERS FOR 2.95! Woop woop! Good quality food for such a little price. n nThe service was great despite the fact that the server was by herself or so I overheard . Sarah was her name. She managed to keep a smile on her face and was very polite. n nThe best plate from my happy hour was the Spicy shrimp and eggplant. The crusted eggplant had a sligh crunch and paired nicely with the black pepper cream sauce. However, the shrimp tasted spicier than the eggplant for some reason. n nThe Brio Burger was decent. Go for the other tasters instead. n nI also enjoyed the sliced steak bruschetta. The tender pieces of steak were topped with yummy gorgonzola. n nI wish there was drink specials on the menu. sad face n nThe seating area in the bar was very nice. There was two lounge areas complete with a love seat and arm chairs. Luckily, I got there in time to bag one! n nThe mini desserts looked so good but I choose just one. The vanilla creme brulee. The strawberries tasted so well with the vanilla custard. I which I ordered three of them! One was simply not enough! n nBrio! I've never been to Italy but I think you just gave me a small taste of it!",2
Not worth the time. Most of the dispensers were empty. Giving sample of fudge that were so small you had a hard time finding it. When I commented. To the lady she said they didn't want to use to much. nThis is an M M world want to be but does not measure up.,1
"I've switched to Dr. Bakerink about 6 months ago and happy so far. Dr. Bakerink takes his time with my boys and provides plenty of time for me to ask questions. Office staff is very friendly and professional. Very easy to schedule an appointment since they are very accommodating. Walk in time is available from 7 to 8 am, which is soooo helpful. The problem with the wait does exist, but just like in any doctor's office.",2
"Sub Par for a Westin restaurant, breakfast buffet was free which was the correct price.",1
Great local business! The owner and employees are friendly and helpful. Love to take our dog with us to shop. Its very dog friendly there. always a bowl of water for dogs to use. The home baked treats are a hit with our pup they have gluten free for him.,2
Love to come here for lunch and order the taco salad with Chicken. Came with our son today and his lunch was free. Great atmosphere as well.,2
They've stepped up their game as far as order times are concerned. Online ordering and menu items make this place a huge seller.,2
Always something different to see on each visit,2
"Finally, a bakery that makes healthy, gluten free muffins that honestly taste good! My favorite was the Sweet Potato Pumpkin. Tastes just like pumpkin pie in a muffin. There was also a good selection of other low fat, gluten free and vegan products such as cheese cakes, cookies, and nut butters with healthy, amazing ingredients. The staff was super nice and gave us several free samples.",2

"I have gone to Andy's nails twice to get my nails done, and a few other times to accompany friends. The place is clean and smells good no overpowering nail polish smell , and they are always on top of everything. Even if you had no appointment you will still be taken care of fairly quickly. nI have gotten acrylic nails done here twice now, and I was completely happy both times. My only complaint at all is that they are a tad bit overpriced. nOther than that they are great, they have a TV to watch while you're waiting or sitting getting a mani pedi, the staff is talkative so it isn't awkward just sitting there, and the atmosphere is good. They are convenient for the people who live near Gilbert Riggs because they are the only nail place close by. I recommend them.",2
"The store is amazing and the chocolate fountain is awesome. This review is for the customer service. nI have never been here before and asked the cashier ""how sweet are your iced mochas?

Am I going to walk away diabetic?! n nI know you are hating your life as every child in Vegas wants a gelato but for those of us who want coffee, AND don't want to drink a milkshake, put on a smile and pretend to give a sh t about customer service. n nThanks!",1
I don't usually go to buffets because I don't eat a lot to begin with. But I was super hungover and hungry so we decided to check it out. We went to the lunch buffet and it was just ok. Nothing spectacular. I read in previous reviews the breakfast buffet is better. If I'm at this hotel again I would be willing to come back to try the breakfast.,1
"Only reason to be here if you really want one n You have the 24 hr BUFFET pass.and are a craving fruits OR b want to drink until you drop on bottomless cheap beers Coors Miller Light or house wine ask for a price of 10.without hitting the casino clubs pubs 7 11 n nAs for all else n the food is SUB PAR.and as expected ie clams mussels are.UGH, a disaster prime rib is at its RUBBER prime.and the New York strip.is as hard as the New York Brick that makes up Wall Street Mexican food section looks and tastes like it was rummaged out of a trashcan SERIOUSLY n can't say much about service when you're a platinum diamond holder but by observing other tables.they are pretty nice! n OH YEAH, while normal guests have the cold crab legs, Platinum Diamond section gets STEAMED crab legs, which, IMHO, are a LOT better n nAmbiance n lots and lots and LOTS of elderly people I'd say that's a good thing if the food was GREAT because the lines to any great items would be SHORT .BUT as mentioned earlier, the food is pretty much sub par.",1
Stayed at TI the weekend of 7 22 7 24. If you drive to Vegas like I did you will find parking at the hotel very convenient.the parking garage is located right off the freeway at Spring Mountain Rd.no hassle dealing with Las Vegas Blvd. traffic. n nCheck in process was very long around 11 30 AM.roughly 30 minute wait. n nRooms were decent for 75 night. Beds were very comfortable and the room was clean and looked newly renovated. TV was on the smaller end but then who watches TV while they are in Vegas. n nCasino was nicely laid out and I was always able to play one of my favorite games. n nThe location of TI is in a nice spot if you like visiting the hotels on the north strip. There is a tram that will take you to the Mirage and from there you can easily walk to Caesars or Bellagio. You can also leave TI and walk to the Wynn or Venetian which is across the street. n nOverall the hotel is a great value. Other hotels in this area are asking 200 night weekends . This hotel works well if you are on a budget and looking to crash somewhere comfortable. If you want the complete experience like ultra clubs and great restaurants you might want to look elsewhere.,2
"Food 1 star. All through out college I tried very hard not to succumb to birthday dinner peer pressure. The gritty sauce is not good I always leave nitty feeling like a train rammed into me.

They raised the prices since I went to college, now a whopping 1.25 for a mixed drink, Madison I think I can afford this the music is always Good but never new top hits, the place is packed. I would never stay. Here past 11 15, leave go to another bar! nSKIP the FOOD.",1
"My wife and I were visiting from Southern CA and had a hankering for sushi. If you appreciate fine sushi, DO NOT eat here. The restaurant is somewhat dingy, and the sushi chefs are not overly responsive. We ordered a rainbow roll that was halfway decent, but the crunchy roll was horrible and had dried noodles on top. This place deserves a pass .",1
"This is probably one of my favorite places in Westgate. The beer and a shot specials are usually what i end up with. For only 7 bucks for a blue moon and a shot of jager it is hard to beat. They have a really good selection of music with the videos playing on numerous tv's.

"omg Becky, look at the white flour on that pizza. okay not only is this pizza NOT very good, but every time I order on line they mess up my order. I am so done with you Papa John's. When I moved I thought well this is the only pizza joint nearby that delivers but I have since found a few others to try. I only went to you out of inertia. Do NOT, Do NOT try to trick me with the free pizza award for my latest complaint that you gave me extra sauce when I ordered light sauce. Because i will THROW it away. I hope I will be giving some other delivery pizza joint a good review soon.",1
"Why why why don't I play laser tag more often? It is SO much fun! And I think the prices here are quite reasonable. I compare many things to the price of a pint in MTL which I'd say is around 7 8.One game 20mins of laser tag was less than 10 , so like an expensive pint of beer, but for your additional toonie you get n To stalk your friends in the dark or strangers, whatevs n To pretend you are in an action film! n To trash talk!

"Do not go to this location. I've been going to the scottsdale and Shea location for years and the food and service there are just better in every way. Maybe a managerial thing? Let's start with probably the worst hostess I've ever dealt with at any restaurant. Went at almost 9pm still a little busy. She told us the wait was 15 mins but I saw at least 3 tables that just haven't been cleaned so I say we will wait. Then she points to 2 open bar stools and says you can sit there if ya want. No thanks. We wait 15 for the tables to get cleaned, and we go to the little middle section with probably 4 out of 6 booths open and she sits us at the tiny table with 2 little chairs? Um no we'll take a booth. She rolls her eyes throws the menus on the booth table and walks away. Just rude in my opinion. Your job is customer service. Wash dishes if you hate dealing with people. Been in the restaurant business for 20 years and would never hire someone like this. Service was good. Pizza had a giant burnt bubble but it wasn't bad. Meatballs were also good. Shrimp scampi had no taste though. Pizooki was good but that's hard to mess up. Take the 15 min drive to the better location on Shea.",1
EEk! Methinks not is right! The food here was terrible. It's pretty bad when you walk into a buffet hungry and leave still feeling hungry.,1

"Thai Dressing Fine Thai Cuisine was a great first Thai experience for me. I enjoyed it so much that I would not mind going back again. The people and service also made the dining experience wonderful. The restaurant is not too large or small everything is clean and neat. Waiters are ready to help when ordering and they give helpful opinions on dish selections. My waiter was hard working, helpful, and attentive. The atmosphere is calming and quiet enough to enjoy your meal. n I ordered the Thai teriyaki chicken from the lunch menu. The dish comes with a Thai salad, white rice, and one vegetable spring roll. My main dish was sweet and had a distinctive taste from all the vegetables. It comes with baby corn, sliced carrots, onions, thinly sliced lettuce, green bell peppers, pineapple, and sliced apples. The vegetables were crunchy and fresh tasting but the apples gave the dish an unusual taste, to me. I did not prefer the apples since it made the meal extremely sweet. You can immediately tell the difference in the Thai dish style compared to the typical Chinese version. It was a nice change and a delicious version of teriyaki chicken. n My salad was the perfect portion for myself and tasted fresh. The small chopped lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage were crunchy and refreshing. The dressing was vinaigrette like with a sweet tangy taste. I enjoyed the flavors, simplicity, and uniqueness of the salad. Lastly, I ordered the homemade coconut ice cream. This also was a perfect portion for the cheap price. The ice cream had a yet rough texture, it was interesting to taste. The texture takes a little time to get used to but otherwise it is delicious. The first bite gives your mouth a bitter taste but after a couple of bites the ice cream becomes addicting. It was perfect for a warm day. I recommend Thai Dressing for everyone!",2
"Wellington, toffee pudding and Mac and cheese was DELISH! My friend had the steak and they said it was amazing ",2
"So, it took awhile, but I finally made my way into Luci's recently. I was driving southbound on 16th street and made a spontaneous decision to stop by. I'd done this once before, but it was when they were closed due to the fire at nearby Richardson's. But, they are re opened now, and they are still on fire. this time just metaphorically speaking . n nI ordered an iced tea at the coffee bar and browsed around a bit. I bumped into Ken, the owner, who gave me a bit of history and a tour of this adorable boutique ish neighborhood grocer. I learned that they revamped their staff from their initial opening, including hiring Chef Eric Guerin, and while I didn't eat while I was there, I will for sure be back to do so soon. the menu looks great especially their omelet selection! n nI could've spent hours looking around they carry a variety of unique health food, vitamins, and eco freindly natural products. I ended up purchasing some vitamins thanks Lucia for your help with that and a citrus smelling Weleda brand natural deodorant I hear so many bad things about regular deodorant, so I am going to give this stuff a shot . n nMy next visit to Luci's will be sooner than later for sure. I can tell, I'd be a regular if it was a tad bit closer to home.",2

Got a groupon for 50 minute massage and 50 minute body scrub with hand foot treatment. That's the only part that made it decent. The body scrub lasted about 35 minutes and they counted me showering as the other 15 minutes. The massage was mediocre but I felt like the therapist wasn't properly trained. He really only did a roller style massage with his forearms and elbows. Little to no kneading. I asked for more but didn't get it. Would not go again. Premises were ok but nothing special. Sauna and showers. Relaxation room,1

"Air conditioning is controlled. Had it set at 60 to see if it would get any colder. Temp said it was 69. Yeah right. I brought my own thermometer because this had happened before. It was actually 78 in the room. Shower design is super lame. Shower width is 1 2 glass, and no door. Water goes everywhere. I have stayed here a few times to confirm consistency and give them another chance. Same every time, in every room. Internet is sporadic, terrible at best. Connects and disconnects constantly. Stewart and Ogden rest is terrible. Food sucks once u get it . Waited 20 minutes to be seated, when half the rest was empty, then took 30 min to get food! Only give you roll of toilet paper on roller. No spare. If you want coffee, you must get it downstairs. All cabanas are empty because you have to spend 150 to get one. No comps on those. Just trying to keep it real. This place is a real bust even if you are comped rooms!",1
"I never want to come back here, which is so disappointing because their location before this one was wonderful. My boyfriend really wanted to come, since he was craving it so badly. n nThe waitress there didn't even ask us whether we wanted a booth or sushi bar table, she just assumed we wanted the bar table. She kept coming back and forth to us wondering if we were ready to order. Come on give us some time to at least look at all your selections. They only serve main entrees during lunch hour, which is strange because I wanted something else that's not sushi related. The appetizers were WAY too over salted. The edamame was covered in salt and half of them were cold and half hot. The seaweed miso soup was just way too overpowering of saltiness, had like 1 tofu and 1 seaweed in it. n nThe only thing keeping me from not going 1 star was the sushi rolls. My most sincere compliments to the sushi chefs because it was delicious. I got the tiger roll and 007 roll. My boyfriend did all you can eat and he thoroughly enjoyed the food as well. n nAnd lastly, the waitress never asked us if we'd like any water until we were almost done with our food. She also never mentioned that a refill on hot tea would be an extra charge. And she kept hovering over us like she wants us out and to hurry up and pay the bill. There was nobody there but another couple. Not sure why she wanted us to hurry up. Whatever, regardless never coming back. I'll go to a closer sushi place by my house thanks.",1
"I'd give this place 3 stars but the drive through line was about 12 cars deep, so we went inside. It took 10 minutes to get our food after ordering. Coulda been a bad night or a bad time 9 30pm but this isn't the first time the lines have been really long here. n nFood is normal, wait is not.",1
"Buddy and I had drinks and ate at the bar. It was a Friday night but a little early so it was fairly quiet. My buddy had Meesa wings and Sliders which he said we just OK, I had caesar salad and gnocchi, both were just average. Not good considering the tiny portions and slightly high prices. Not that it affected my rating, but to make things worse, both my friend and I had upset stomachs the rest of the night, while he actually had bad diarrhea through the next day let's just leave it at that. I will say the bartender was really friendly and made us some good drinks.",1
Food sucked. Strawberry's were kinda fresh. prices way too high. no more chicken up grade available. prices too high,1

The place is HUGE and there's a lot of room for dancing and lounging and socializing. Slowly but surely people started filling in, and we met a super nice Drag Queen Kiki and so we stayed to watch her thing at midnight. n nDrinks were generous, the people were nice, and I will definitely return.",2
I give this place 2 stars.why you ask.simply this. I know a good burger when I eat one and this was not it. No doubt was it a solid effort on trying something new with incorporating beer with cooking the burgers but it just wasn't there. The flavors just weren't there. Also My burger just fell apart at the end. If they would try using a brioche bun instead it will also help keep the burger stable when compiling all those topping we love so much. There are so many great places In las vegas to get a burger and this is not one of them. Two thumbs down.,1
"It's been ten months, so I whipped back into this big place today for lunch to see how they're doing, having presumably inherited the recently closed Super Moon's customers. They were nice busy by 11 45 AM, as I started selecting from the big array of 127 food items, not counting sauces and dressings. n nI enjoyed some good Hot Sour Soup, then moved on to Caesar Salad, half an hard boiled egg, some tuna, Potato Salad, several Sushi treats and more. Then it was over to the Mongolian style BBQ, featuring five meats and various fruits vegetables. I made my selections, including beef, pork, shrimp and chicken, and requested that the chef just prepare everything with the sauces HE likes, and it came out great! n nFrom over on the hot tables I enjoyed a variety of different beef and pork rib selections, some good fried chicken, shell it yourself crab pinchers, stuffed crab, flame broiled pork steak, good ham more, ending up with desserts including one of the eight kinds of REAL ice cream. n nWas it perfect? No. The ice cream was chilled harder than it should have been, which I griped about, and the canned whipped topping was the cheap fake kind, not real whipped cream such as Reddi Wip. Come on, Mandarin! n nSo? So as last time, it's a solid 4 Stars for Mandarin Supper Buffet where it's dinner price on weekends of 9.99 8.99 Sr. ",2
"Almost all of my shopping is done here. They have ""double ad day "" on Wednesdays, where last week's sales overlap with the current sales. Their prices are very reasonable to begin with. Much cheaper than Whole Foods and even Trader Joe's, which I never go to any more. n nThe produce section here is great, everything is always fresh. They even have bulk salad and baby spinach. Speaking of bulk, they have a very wide selection including granolas, nuts, candy, snacks, dried fruit, etc. They also have a good selection of meat, including bison. At the store in Albuquerque they even had ostrich meat in the freezer, but I haven't looked for it here. n nDepending on your habits, this may or may not be one stop shopping. If you're really dedicated to your Crest toothpaste and Fritos, you should go elsewhere. Chances are they have what you need, but with less synthetic ingredients. By the way, I think ""Seventh Generation "" is a really terrible name for toilet paper. n nI've only had one bad experience here. I went on a Tuesday and they were out of literally about a third of what I needed. Some of the bread was getting moldy and the produce was looking rather. saggy. I'll stick with Wednesdays.",2
I joined Kansas City Barbecue Society for 35 just to be able to get free day passes to RD. I was really interested in trying some of their private label wines. Unfortunately at the cash register I found out you can't buy any alcohol from them unless you have a liquor license. Then I had to wait for about a half an hour to get a refund after they overcharged me 6 for an 11 lb. bar of Callebaut dark chocolate that had been entered in their computer wrong. Not a happy camper.,1
"This was the worst hotel I've stayed in. I've never received such poor services from EVERY establishment within the hotel. Every single person in my group agreed with this and we will NEVER stay at this hotel again. n nThe worst part is no one working at the hotel seemed to care that the service wasn't good and that are rooms weren't correct. We talked to management two times and both times they didn't seem to care and nothing was done to fix the issues. n nI'm the type of person that knows things go wrong and that's fine but when the hotel doesn't seem to care about it and pretty much has a I don't give a shit attitude, that's not okay with me. n nThis hotel was a lot more expensive that other hotels when the reservations were booked but are whole group decided to stay there since we thought it was a nice hotel. I hope quite a few people read this comment and decide against staying there. n nAgain, issues happen but an establishment with the mentality of not caring isn't going to change unless there are major management changes. n nI highly recommend AVOIDING this hotel.

I gave one star because the food was good. Service terrible. My husband and I went out for our last date night for a while before welcoming our son into the world. We were seated quickly and a server introduced himself because our server was busy with a big party needless to say we had FOUR different servers which is ok but our appetizers bread and entrees came out within 5 minutes of eachother. Frustrating to say the least then the server came by and asked if we would like our filets put under the heat lamp while we finished our appetizers both of us enjoy our steaks medium rare medium so a heat lamp is deff not a solution. n nI'm not one to complain but if I am going somewhere spending over 30 a plate I'd enjoy not being rushed through our entire meal. Will not be returning anytime soon.,1
"Expect greatness when you walk through the door. They go out of their way to distinguish themselves as something extraordinary, and they succeed.

I ordered a Diablo something and beyond the taste even the glass was classy. n nOur server Brittany was unstoppably attentive, humorous, and A all around. n nThey need to work on dimming the lighting a bit but otherwise the mood is perfect for a date spot. n nLast thing I'll say is it twas a shame that some putzes showed up wearing shorts and t shirts looking like casual tourists. Though they were perfectly accepted by the staff, this place is a classy joint.so if you go then at least have fun and dress up a bit more than being in your family room on Sunday watching the football game and enjoy the cool elegance of something wonderful. n nLooking forward to seeing this place thrive.",2

"Las Vegas is Sin City for a reason it celebrates the seven deadly sins. In Vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. We were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. We wanted to get stuffed with something Hot N Juicy. n nHot N Juicy is known for their seafood crab Dungeness, blue, snow , shrimp, and of course, crawfish. You pick the type of seasoning Juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper or the Hot n Juicy Special and the level of spiciness mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy . n nWe ordered 2 lbs of snow crab legs and 2 lbs of crawfish with Juicy Cajun at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red potatoes, etouffee a Cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo , and a side of sweet potato fries. Eating at Hot N Juicy is not an elegant refine affair. It's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. You open the bag and dig in. n nThe crab meat was very sweet and juicy. It was perfectly cooked. I found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. The meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. I found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where I could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. Also I got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because I sucked crawfish heads. After a while my lips got tingly and numb from the Cajun spices. n nI've never had crawfish whole before. I only had them de shelled. While I love crawfish and the meat was great, I'll never have them whole like that again. The tail meat is rather tiny I like 'em big size matters when it comes to these things . At the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. Crawfish is mostly shell and I'd rather pay someone to shell them for me. n nEtouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. I liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. I thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable. n nThe boiled red potatoes were much needed as a break from the relentless Cajun spice. They were nice and sweet. The corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. The sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty. n nThe final price for all of us was 30 person for three people. We gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. Happy ending for us indeed. n nWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.",2

This place is way over rated. The fried dumplings with pork chives and shrimp was not tasty at all. Customer service sucks big time. I don't understand the hype about this. Perhaps the people who rate have not been to good dumpling places before. We recently came back from shanghai and the dumplings there are much better than this crap. The waitress server also discriminates toward chinese people. They only favor other tourists.,1

I had sampled the other Not Just Coffee earlier in the week so I knew what to expect with this one. It was simply fantastic.

"We caught last night's showing of Bite. Great seats, close to the stage, but to be honest, just about any seat in the theatre is going to be a good one.

You MUST try it! , tabbouleh also made to perfection , the Vegetarian platter 1 with the delicious Spinach Pie, Falafel flavorful and moist on the inside, cripsy on the outside with perfect texture , the very best Hummus I have ever tasted and I have tasted so much hummus , pita and a delicious tahini with onion and spices mixed in. The Pistachio Baklava is amazing too, but I don't recommend trying it because you will dream about it and have to fight the urge to order it daily. n n Great Food n Very reasonably priced n Very generous portions n FriendlyService n nMy only negative feedback is that they close at 7, so there were days I wanted to order take out, but didn't finish up at work in time to make it. n nNow I want Kibbeh and Tabooli from Olive Tree but I'm stuck here in rainy Washington. Boo!",2
I have come here a couple times. the first time the service wasn't very stellar. I decided to give it another chance and I was very impressed. The BREAKFAST WAS COOKED PERFECT! The fruit that came with the meal was actually ripe and the potatoes were delicious. The service was very good I actually think it was the owner that waited on us . He even threw in the bacon for free which was nice. alltogether a great liittle cafe that i will definately come back to.,2

"Pier 1 is one of those stores that never get too full. Maybe because they tend to be more on the costly side, but once in a while they do have some good sales. Their furnishing is fun, bright, and vivid. The deep reds, teal, and aqua themes are some of my favorite. Not to mention that Pier 1 takes the highly popularized travel theme and made it that much better. The passport standing screen, drawer, and chest are adorable. I want to have these items interspersed throughout the house. Being an adult is no fun sometimes. Especially when you see the price tag. Oh well, nice things are never cheap.",2
"I would give this eat n park location zero stars if I could. I arrived at 11 15am and was seated quickly but that was about it. My waitress did not come over until 11 41. I did not receive water or any service for 26 minutes. That is outrageous to me, I've never had anything good to say about this location and will not be visiting again.",1
"LOVE JIMMY JOHNS. But I'm kind of pissed at this location. I was overcharged and not given my appropriate change back. I was upsold on my sandwich and not informed of the extra dollar charge as well. Also, at the time I began this review, workers in the back were ""pretending "" to sneeze on things. Not appropriate for food service. I have never had a problem at the ones back home in South Dakota. n nPS I WOULD GO TO A LOCATION IN LOS ANGELES IF THEY HAD FRANCHISES HERE!",1
Great place to take out of towners to for a good pizza. You really can't go wrong with any pizzas on the menu. If you are a craft beer fan you will love their happy hour half off drinks . Best place on mill if you are looking to drink good beer and just hang out with a small group of friends. Patio is perfect for watching all the drunk frat boy monkeys and their skeezy girls act like idiots.,2
"I'm a graduate student and found myself without a printer. I know, that's terrible isn't it? I needed to read a 27 page article from online, and I can't stand screen reading. So I looked to find a place to have it printed. I was stunned when UPS said it would only cost me 2.43 or so AND they would have it ready the next day for no additional charge. Staples always charges 5 extra if you want it the next day. So I uploaded the document, paid, and then went to bed. I called the next morning and the woman who answered the phone told me they didn't see it, but located the order a few seconds later. Maybe 5 minutes after we hung up, she called me and left a voicemail that it was ready to pick up. It was perfect because I ride the bus and had to go to Glendale to catch my connecting bus to go to work, so I was able to pick it up between buses. They got me in and out of there in just a couple minutes, and were so sweet. Nothing was wrong with my order and it was perfect. UPS is my new source for printing!",2
"Noodles hand rolled right infront of you. doesnt get much better than that. Love it! Once you see the 5 different types of noodles that you can chhose from, you'll just be confused. But confused in a good way ",2
"I've ate here three times in the past two weeks for lunch and have to say I LOVE the food. Excellent service, reasonably priced full meal lunch specials with soup, crab puff, spring roll, rice and main course for under 5 even the Shrimp dishes are under 6 n nI'm going to check out the dinner there soon. I loved their Hot Sour Soup and would recommend any of the Prawn lunch specials or the Cashew Chicken. n nFor your local neighborhood Chinese sit down meal, you just can't beat it for the quality, price and service. At least that has been my two friends and my experience over multiple occasions. My friend who lives in the neighborhood has ate here many times and recommended it to us. Thanks, Ian!",2
"Schnitzel bonanza! I came here with my family for a nice German time, plus I was craving for a schnitzel for months since I came from San Fran. Inside the ambiance is very lets say, German feeling not that I've been to Germany. But from pictures I can imagine, right? high ceilings and wooden support beams cover this restaurant. The wooden beams are Covered with fliers of Spaten German beer which gives a feeling of Germany party feeling. n nSo let's get to the food. I got schweitzer schnitzel I believe which is breaded pork stuffed with swiss cheese and ham. It was delicious but I think San Fran still has it for me . Inside there was black forest ham, which gave it an extra touch of it and it oozed out Swiss cheese. n nOther dishes were pork tenderloin and pan fried ham of pork topped with an egg. They didn't think it was bad because it was healthy and wasn't too oily nor salty. n nFor dessert we ordered some ice cream with peach schnapps topped with raspberry. It was okay, the raspberry had a hint of sourness but at the same time the ice cream balanced the sour taste. It was an interesting combination. n nOverall, I felt pretty good about this restaurant considering its in Charlotte and one of the only German restaurants the city offers. They fulfilled my tummy and I will come here if I crave for schnitzels, maybe try another type of schnitzel next time.",2
I came to Camden pines to get away from the streese's of life not to see more of it there is drug dealers gang bangers and there is no security guard you can never get a break even if you try to go for walk you have to watch yourself because thepeople drive like maniacs and don't care who they run over,1
"Dolce, I love you! They have amazing bartenders Paul is the BEST! , a fantastic wine selection and surprisingly great food. I say ""surprisingly "" because I usually don't expect much from the food that gets sold at bars. BUT, the ""Beast From the Middle East "" wrap is my go to sandwich it has stuffed grapes leave INSIDE THE WRAP, y'all , and their honey drizzled baked brie is out of this world. Their Sunday morning waffles are insanely good, too. Check this place out, since there seems to be something for everyone here. they even have plenty of beer mixed drinks for the non wine folks.",2
"Ticoz is a fantastic neighborhood restaurant bar. I've been here a few times now and never had a bad experience. The food is great, the staff is friendly and the establishment is clean. I recommend this place to anyone looking for an enjoyable time while enjoying a great meal.",2
"Not worth the price after having been to the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio Hotel Casino. This buffet was key word, ""was "" rated the 1 buffet in Vegas but since the rating, there have been a whole group of buffets that have outdone this place. This restaurant is mediocre at best. Also, service is very spotty. Once you go Carnival World Buffet, you don't go back!",1
Ugh no.,1
Love the bacon breakfast burrito and the beans! Rolled tacos are yummy too! Their salsas are good too!,2
"My husband and I had just purchased show tickets, and attached to the ticket was a stub featuring Roxy's Diner. We thought that we should give it a shot because we were quite hungry. The busser told us that we would be served by someone and pointed at someone who wasn't even there. We waited for a long time for a server until finally we decided to leave because it was obvious that the employees were slacking. n nI would definitely not go back again.",1
"What a pit. n nDirty, threadbare and garish. There are so many nicer places to spend your time in Vegas. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. It's head poundingly loud, the wait staff are rude and the whole place needs a good cleaning. Just. don't.",1
My AC went out mid summer I called my regular techs no response so I called ARA the came out 20 mins later found problem had to replace outside unit I knew it was going to happen. the next day was the weekend they replaced it checked my other unit at no extra charge and no charge for the weekend repair. Great service,2
"My ladies and I decided to have a nice girl's day out, so we headed to Rachel's Kitchen for brunch. n nI was a little disappointed to find out this place was a stand up and order at the counter type joint. I'm not embarrassed to admit it. I like waiter service! We ordered and found ourselves a TINY little booth to accommodate us. The table was abnormally slim and not very practical. n nHeat kept wafting from the kitchen area, which I found a little annoying. I ordered the grilled cheese and a watermelon juice. My friends ordered the breakfast burrito. The food was pretty good, not nearly good enough to be worth the somewhat hefty pricetag, but I digress. The food was fresh and my friends loved the potatoes, although I found them to be a tad soft and underseasoned. I loved my fresh watermelon juice and highly recommend that, so refreshing. Whenever I see that on a menu I have to order. It's my favorite. n nAll in all, I've had better, but this place will do in a pinch. I'm definitely not itching to go back and if I'm in the area again I'd probably try any number of other restaurant options. Good option for healthy eating, though.",1
I remember this place being good the few times I went there. I had a chicken salad sandwich one time that was awesome. I miss it.,2
This place is awesome . I had the vegetarian sushi and it was perfect. The service was great and the employees were extremely knowledgeable about their choices. Thank you Jaime and Michael for vegan recommendations. YOU GUYS ROCK !,2
"After reading the reviews on this place, I had high hopes that the food would be great. Can we say Chinese stew? We had the hot n sour and egg drop soup, and it was so thick it looked like stew. Both soups were especially mediocre and packed with ingredients that were either previously frozen or just cooked to death and void of any resemblance of their original state. The crab puffs were large wonton wrappers with cream cheese. The KungPow shrimp was a gluttonous glop of soaked veggies in a soup of sauce poured over beautiful shrimp that drowned. The teriyaki wood planks I think I ordered chicken were amply dry and chewy. I will try to dry them out a bit more for some chicken jerky for my next hiking trip. I will go find my special bottle of Alka Seltzer to round out this meal.",1
"Noor is a quality takeaway with a small eating area 3 tables and a kitchen you can see while waiting for your food. The curries are fresh, the nan light and the pakoras and samosas are crisp and delicious, basically exactly what you want in Indian food. n nThe staff are friendly and happy to serve the food at the tables, if you want to sit in and the food itself is great, so if you are in the area give it a try.",2
"Probably one of the most romantic and intimate restaurants I've ever dined in with a price tag to go with it. I think I may have been far too young to be eating here. Looking around the room everyone was in 40s 60s. Beautiful space. The service was outstanding and almost too stuffy. Very ""French "" . n nStarters n nStarted out with a couple of sparkling roses. I think this has to be my new favorite drink starter. They have a couple of tasting menus but we opted out of it. There's only so much food a girl can eat. n nThe warm scallop carpaccio which I hate to say. I found rubbery. I'm sure how it was presented and served was no accident but I just didn't enjoy it. n nFoie Gras 3 ways was not nearly the best I've ever had but good enough. nPoached Duck Foie Gras, Choucroute Garnie nHorseradish Emulsion Bouillon nTerrine of Duck Foie Gras marbled Dried Figs, Date Paste, Pimentos Pur u00e9e nShaved fresh Foie Gras, Tandoori Apple Reduction, Spinach Salad, Green Apples n nLangoustine 3 ways was amazing! Favorite was the tempura style. I have to say it was my first time having langoustine. It's not often seen on very many menus. n nPan seared with Terre de Sienne Spice, Cabbage Leaf Celery Root Pur u00e9e nTempura, Baby Onion with Paprika nTartar with Grapefruit Juice, Declination of Turnips n nMain Courses n nSea bass with lemon caviar caper over green parmesan crumble nNebraska veal chop. These two dishes were executed to perfection! Definite 10s for flavor, presentation and creativity! The fish was so tender and flavorful. n nDessert n nPistachio souffl u00e9, exotic fruit salad and petit fours. The souffle was delightful. Piping hot and raised beautifully. The fruit salad was nothing out of the ordinary. The petit fours were courtesy of the chef and they were amazing but by this time I was ready to explode so took a nibble of each piece just to sample. n nThe sommelier was young, knowledgable and technical when it came down to his selection for each food wine pairing. That's just great but IMHO I think food wine pairing is more of an art. I just felt he was too text book for my style. Don't get me wrong the pairings worked, but I just prefer to have more creativity involved. It can't all be about the science especially when it comes to culinary arts and cuisine. n nExtras n nThey've even got a gluten free vegetarian menu and will ask if there are any food allergies. Very accommodating as one would expect for a restaurant of this caliber.",2
"OMG. Hit the restroom prior to ordering. It smelled so bad from long term lack of cleaning that I was afraid to order food. I mentioned it to my husband, who had just returned from the men's room. He said the same thing. We left.feared that the kitchen cleanliness was of the same caliber. Come on guys.a little Lysol and elbow grease goes a long way.",1
"I have never met a clubhouse manager as rude as here at Johnson ranch. I understand you dont make the rules dude, but we are still paying 280 for a round of golf for my family and I should be treated with kindness and respect, not contempt. Don't expect any of your family or friends to be able to accompany you on a round to watch. This is the first course in hundreds where my disabled wife was required to pay a green fee for a round of gold just to ride along in the cart as a passenger. Unbelievable. I will not be back. They do have a pretty back nine, but I couldn't enjoy it after being treated so rudely.",1

"I have a Subaru that is a few years old that I recently bought from a non Subaru dealership and when I bought it I found out it was time for the timing belt to be done. n nAfter a good amount of research on the job at hand I decided that it was best to bring it to Subaru to feel the most comfortable with the labor being performed on the engine. n nI knew the price was not going to be cheap and was prepared for that, but I was very happily surprised with the options that Mike from Zenkai performance has to offer when it comes to something as simple as the belts. I had also in mind doing my fluids and even I have to say for a dealership for all the work I had done I am not disappointed. I now have the peace of mind knowing I have Gates racing belts and Motul fluids in my engine, trans, and diff, and it all came in being just a little bit more than the quote for the timing belt job. n nThanks again for a warm welcome to Subaru ownership. I can not wait to be the driver of my car for its next 100k miles. n nI will definitely see them in 4k miles to stock up on Motul engine oil if I do not get lazy and go to walmart for Rotella. n nI also really like my ""touched by Mo "" sticker, I feel like my car has a dedicated Dr.",2
Here for the first time and ordered beef only was awesome and outstanding combination of the spice. Good atmosphere and highly recommend the place. Cost is so good and reasonable. Good quality of cooking. Easy coming at the place.,2
"I recently moved to the Scottsdale area and was looking for a place that had really good pho. I saw the great reviews it had here so I thought I would try it. Forewarning I'm Vietnamese myself and have eaten plenty of pho so I had my expectations high coming to this place. I ordered a pho tai and it came out very bland with very little to no seasoning. I am not sure if I got a bad batch or what, but it was probably the worst bowl of pho I have had in a long, long time. They did have really good service, but as for pho I was not impressed by any means.",1
"The hours are pretty good here and you can get in any day of the week. Dr. Drew is good. I had never been to a chiropractor before, so the first time I did was with him. Having never been, at first I thought his adjustments were a bit rough. However, I know now that his adjustments are really good. After my first visit I had adjustments from two other chiropractors at a different The Joint. I ended up going back to Dr. Drew. His adjustments feel so much more complete, and I can tell that I have been fully adjusted. It makes a world of difference. I definitely recommend this location and this doctor.",2
This is one of my favorite places in Vegas to eat brunch of lunch because you can sit outside and people watch the strip while eating great food. They have heaters on the patio and usually it doesn't take long to get one of the patio tables even when they are busy.,2
"We were really looking forward to checking this place out before a concert on a Friday night. We arrived around 530 and it was not to busy so we figured that would help us get in and out fairly quickly. No one greeted us so we were kind of lost as to was it open seating or wait to be seated. After a couple minutes of looking lost we were told we could sit any where. A few minutes later I grabbed a couple menus from the counter to see what they had to offer. The waiter did finally show up did not offer any specials or really explain anything. Using a Living Social voucher we each got a glass of wine and a ""melt "" the wine was decent enough. The melt was well strange. It really was just a whole bunch of cheese melted on a doughy flat bread with a few pieces of sausage on it. We did order a couple of other food items as well. The other melt had pear and a balsamic reduction on it. This offered a bit more flavor and was decent enough. We were really looking forward to the baked avocados. Its an avocado split in half and filled with onions and corn and a few other non descript items. The whole thing was rolled in panko and baked. Well it tasted like exactly what it was named a baked avocado. No other flavor at all. In fact it was almost bizarre having that warm mushy avocado texture and not much else. Needless to say the whole outing left us disappointed. It's one of those places that online it seems great and then you go there and its nothing like what you expected. It's fine if you do not want a busy place or quick service. But I'd skip it and hit a more well known joint like Postinos.",1
"Hat take out yesterday Monday night, 8 pm. too much sauce on wings wow. and the wings, well dont think I could find any meat on the wings and for the price, not really a great value when you ask for 2 flavors and the expensive small drink. over all the frys are good as usual and i most likely will go back due to convenience and tolerable but not cravable.",1

I have an iron stomach and the sushi I had here put some chinks in it. Obviously something wasn't fresh. n nThe service was good. nThe Toro Sashimi wasn't good due to the stringiness of the fish.

"We decided to try Eggs and more, we had a coupon but forgot to present it when we ordered, the coupon does say to present when ordering but the waitress was really nice and said that she would get the boss to override the check so she could accept it. I could not believe how rude the boss was, he came out to the table and made a scene and ruined our appetite. We will never go back and we will bad mouth this so called resturant to everyone we know.

My second favorite pizza place in the valley. Along with the baked spaghetti pie your meal will be delightful. Finish it with the Italian Almond Wine Cake!,2
"I truly enjoy every visit to Pita Jungle. I get excited knowing it'll be exceptionally good, and good for me. The hummus with grilled chicken is enough for two people. Skip the regular, boring hummus and go with half roasted bell pepper, half cilantro jalapeno for a winning combination under 10 bucks. Throw in an extra pita and you've got a full lunch or dinner packed with mouth watering flavor and tons of protein for all you diet fitness fans. n nIt's been months since I've strayed from my beloved hummus, but I can't fail to mention noteworthy selections on the menu. The roasted chicken shawarma pita is your standard gyro. Tender meat and fresh veggies. Ask for extra tzatziki sauce n nFancy stepping out of your carnivorous comfort zone? The Chipotle Black Bean Burger will satisfy your need for spices not heat , and double down on an intricate blend of healthy ingredients. Homemade black beans are the building blocks of the patty, tossed with onions, garlic, bell peppers, oats, cranberries, you get the picture! Served up with chipotle hummus and potatoes. My recommendation for nervous new vegetarians who can't fathom giving up the beef.",2
"Great food and friendly service, atmosphere lacks an Italian feel. I went here on Sunday evening. Its not a large restaurant, its clean and well lit. First though walking in was though it was modern and minimalist. Didn't speak Italian to me, so I figured would wait for the food. Our first round of drinks was a little watered down, but didn't mention anything as my blue mojito seemed removed from the world of Italy. When they brought the food, though it spoke wonderful Italian. We had the aspargus with parmesan and mushrooms to start. I am no fan of mushrooms, but these were great. Buttery, not too chewy, and just right. My ex and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Portions were just right and the sauce was perfect, not too thick and perfect in its tomatoess. Food was brought out fairly quickly. I look forward to coming again, my only impression leaving was with the interior, it felt kind of like the Pei Wei of Italian, just lacking the red trademark Pei Wei lighting. Maybe they can substitute yello or blue and make it trade mark Babbo.",2
I went here after work for the first time. I work swing shift i needed a fill bad this was the only place open when i got out of work so i thought i would give them a try. Wow worst customer service ever! After waiting at the door for ever a lady finally came to tell me she didn't have time for me. Eventually she did get me in after watching her doing nothing for some time . She rushed to get my nails done they were very poorly done she definitely has no pride in her work! I will never go back or even recommend anyone to go to this place . I'm surprised they are still in business i never seen such horrible customer service nor poorly work done on my nails. Very sad!,1
"This place was horrendous. Sadly, the food was decent but it took 20 minutes to get a beer, if the waitress remembered. My husband and I were enjoying our visit and figured that because we were on vacation, we didn't mind if the drinks came slow. Then, as we were headed to our dinner reservation, we put our credit card in the bill, the waitress took it, and then she informs us that she 'lost it.' We figured we'd be patient and give her a few minutes to find it.but instead she proceeded to serve other customers. It then took us ten minutes to get a manager to stop watching a TV screen to help.they were all rude but did carry on with minor assistance. That was when we met the owner. The owner of this place is an arrogant, rude, and disgraceful person. He 'found' our card on the floor but surprisingly came out of a sketchy back room?!?! , then blamed us for placing the card on the floor, refused to comp our drinks, and verbally threatened my husband. I'm all for people making mistakes but the people in this bar are too full of themselves to even apologize. It was a sickening display of humanity and service. I have many friends and customers in Charlotte and will NEVER recommend this place. Don't waste your time.or for the matter, your credit cards. They apparently don't care about customers.",1
"while it's a nice location and pretty nice, but small, apartments i found out that they are very shady. i went in to look at an apartment and liked it a lot. started the application process which has an application and administrative fee attached. you get nothing in writing about this however. i ended up contacting them the next day to cancel, less than 24 hours later, and was told that i wouldn't be getting the admin fee refunded. this wouldn't be so bad if it weren't over 300! this is absolutely ridiculous, if it were in writing somewhere i would understand more but the paperwork i received said i had 48 hours to cancel. nthey've not been helpful at all just keep repeating back to me that we'd discussed it. i suggest that unless you're VERY serious about moving there, like, no other options or anything else, STAY AWAY or you will be out a lot of hard earned money.",1
The customer service was poor and our room was outdated! We thought it would be a nice staycation for our anniversary and boy was I wrong!

Oh i wish the distance from OC to Vegas is 30 minutes so that I can eat here every other day. Why why why can't we have a place like this somewhere in OC?,2

"We were walking into the restaurant as 2 customers walked out and one told us ""DON'T EVEN BOTHER. "" We didn't listen to the advice. nThe meal consists of tasteless grocery store hotdog with coleslaw, barbecue sauce and fries.

"Good price for the all you can eat. Interesting sushi choices. Had one that tastes like a whopper. One was like lasagna. Nice atmosphere. Good customer service. Quick. Correct. Good suggestions from them. Ill be back. We did some damage here, they lost with us.",2
"I've been here a plethora of times, but I am very disappointed with the recent changes. Instead of going through the line and ordering your items you order at the beginning and then sit down and all of your food is brought to you. They did this in an attempt to make things faster, unfortunately it took the good customer service out of it. The ordering process is much more complicated and you are unable to see the menus. They give you a printed menu to combat this, but it isn't as simple as the ones that are hanging and divided by station. Trying to make specifications on your order, which used to be so simple, is now complicated and the staff taking orders clearly aren't trained well on it. To top it off, my food came out wrong, which is indicative of the poor way the ordering is set up. n nTrying to get someone to clean off a table for you to sit down during busy times is clearly too much to ask for. The food is good, but I will no longer continue to come here. If this is how all Paradise Bakery locations function now, I won't be going to any of them. You have lost a very loyal customer and I know I'm not the only one.",1
"I'm glad to see there are other negative reviews on here as well. The other reviewers are right, the mechanics at this place lie to the customers and invent problems that don't exist. I took my car in to have an exhaust leak fixed, and was told my front brakes AND my front shocks were completely shot. I was already suspicious because I hadn't heard any noise from the front of my car, so I took my car somewhere else. Everything was fine and to top it off, the exhaust problem that Midas found was only a small part of the problem and wouldn't have fixed the noise my car was making. n nVery unhappy with this place. Make sure you do your research before believing what they tell you.",1
"Aside from the refreshing views of its pools and landscaped courtyards, the Buffet falls short of an aria. n nThe selection boasts Alaskan King Crab Legs diminutive, a bit salty , made to order pastas and omelets, sushi more CA rolls than actual sushi , pizza, salad bar very unexciting , and a carving station the salmon baked in salt was A OK . n nAria's buffet only saving grace lies in its taste of sweet. I really liked the grand Marnier cream puff. Sugar free desserts chocolate gelato, key lime pie were scarce but good. Pastry Chef Jean Philippe Maury 's gives you a sample of his signature creations at the Buffet but for full indulgence check out his patisserie next to the guest elevators.",1
Made an appointment to have my fenders rolled but the guy doing the job is out of town for family reasons. No biggie but made the appointment when he'd be back. I stated that 12 noon was the latest I could bring my car to have the work done. I heard more then once that their garage was full of cars. It made me feel like they weren't interested in my business. So I finally talk to the guy actually doing the work and he wants me to bring my car in to see what hes dealing with. I'm pretty busy and don t have time to just bring my car over for the hell of it. Plus it's a very very common car so obviously this person doesn't do to many of these jobs. So I tell him I cant come over and he says to just bring it in on the day of my appointment but he tells me to bring it in at 1 which is to late for me. So I email the owner or whoever and tell him I have to cancel the appointment because it's to late and he says ok. So they really didn't want my business which is sad because when I find a shop I like I spend a good amount of money there but oh well there loss.,1

"I spent about three hours here with nothing to distract me.it was heaven. You walk in past dimly lit waterfalls and pools filled with rocks to enter the cave like spa. They have the dipping pools cold, warm, and hot and a steam room and sauna which are teeeeny! luckily there were only like 2 other people inside when I went, otherwise I could see this place getting really crowded. n nWhen it was time for my brown sugar manicure, I headed upstairs to see Angel who was a sweetheart However, the atmosphere of the salon is much less impressive than the spa area.kind of like a get in, get it done, and get out vibe. With a 100 spa credit from the hotel, I was happy with my manicure, but otherwise 65 dollars to get my hands rubbed with sugar and my nails polished would be a bit much. n nBut heyyy it's Vegas! Relax for a bit then head to Morea if you're staying in Mandalay bay.gotta love the ""european "" day pool concept ",2
"The good things about Yayo Taco are the value and the beer selection. With the student special I got more food than I could handle. 3 tacos, 2 sides, and a drink they even let me upgrade my drink to a beer for an upcharge. The beer selection is awesome too. n nUnfortunately, this restaurant can't be judged at face value. The food was awful. I'm talking about tacos that were flavorless, the chips were stale, and their signature salsa and rice was disgusting. n nThis was so disappointing. Everyone has been telling me how good Yayo's is, the ambiance looks fun, the portions and presentations are good, the service staff was well informed, and the value was amazing. However all these things are just a fa u00e7ade for really bad food.",1

"I have mixed feelings. The person who helped me was pretty competent and pleasant. But like many people complain, I find Cox Cable itself is just becoming too shady to deal with as a provider. n nI was in line with a relatively short line of people who also seemed to be turning in their boxes that provide premium channels. I took mine in to cancel all non basic channels after getting an across the board rate hike of 40 . They raised the price of cable TV, the box rental how did that become more expensive? and the internet jumped up. All by a lot. This is the third time I've had to go in to turn something in DVR, another decoder box after opening my bill to find they once again raised my prices. I got the price lock which helped sort of for a couple of years, though the savings on TV were wiped out by the rate hikes on internet. n nOn the way in, there is a self serve check in kiosk. Nice idea, but it had only the message ""unable to connect to the internet "". n nLike my friends who left Cox and never looked back, I will cancel everything with them once I have Direct TV and Century Link installed. Cox.save your money sending me mailers and emails saying you want me back like you do to former customers. The time to say you appreciated my business was while you had me and not ""testing "" how much I would pay. You found that one out.",1
"After having a bad nail job at The Summit, I went here to get redone! Night Day experience. Everyone very happy and pleasant, Vivian was new and did a wonderful job on my toes and Tammy redid a bad nail job I had a week earlier. Both were wonderful and took their time even though we were last customer of the night. The salon is very clean and updated.I would highly recommend to anyone who is picky about their mani pedicures.",2

Allways get good service when I go I there. nThey have alot of good stuff. nI usually buy every thing I need from there. nBut when you need tires changed they allways take for ever. Usually a day or so.,2
"I was so excited to revisit the old Agave. I love the outside patio. Unfortunately, it was too hot for my taste. We were seated by the door and it was still pretty warm inside. I did enjoy the chips and salsa. However, my sangria was sample sized. We order the ceviche duo with shrimp and tuna. There might have been one or two very small chopped shrimp and a few bits of tuna. Since I was so warm, I ordered the chopped salad. It was bland. Won't be back again.",1
"After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to gather a few friends to try out this so called hidden gem. I have to say we were greatly disappointed! We ordered the highly suggested Beef Roll and received what seemed to be a cold, Mexican burrito. It was dry and tasteless. We also ordered the steamed juicy buns, which were no more than pork dumplings. The rest of the meal consisted of Walnut Shrimp, Tofu with Black Bean Sauce and Veggie Chow Mein. They were ok.nothing that lived up to the great reviews. The service wasn't much to brag about either. The entrees came out sporadically and we weren't hungry by the time the last item arrived. Also, the waiter was hard to track down and we had to follow up a few times for items we requested. Our overall experience was lackluster and I have to give it the thumbs down!",1
Bill Cleveland was great at solving my issues and following up to make sure I was satisfied with the service.,2
"We were in town from Jamaica and decided to try Kaya. Music had a reggae flava with wonderful ambiance and scenery! Sampled 3 apps and the fish tacos entree. The salmon crab cakes were fresh and delish along with the 3 green salad. The calamari was just ok as the ringlets were small and didn't taste the freshest. nThe fish tacos talapia were served with soft tortillas and asked for my fish grilled and was filling and tasty. nService was great, mildy pricy but rewarding. The only negative was the red sangria which wantde to be a real tasty drink but tasted more like enhanced kool aid! ' nOverall a positive experience and will be back.",2
"Folding chairs, actual metal folding chairs, like from the 80's. Some sections have the typical chairs, but a few including section J, for example are made up entirely of folding chairs.",1
Service is excellent. Bread was over buttered. Nice little cafe with good prices. Food was overall good.,2
"Um, YUM! We got the garden salad very fresh. We also got the pizza with avocado, olives, etc. VERY good. The dough is soooo yummy and you can tell they just made it. The toppings were perfect. EAT HERE.",2
"I can't believe the great reviews this place gets. I think its reputation among people who actually care about good food was summed up by two separate concierges at our 5 star hotel when I told them we hadn't liked Don Charlies ""WHO SENT YOU to Don Charlies? "" Its listing as a ""steakhouse "" and reviews referring to it as ""steakhouse "" or ""chop house "" leads you to believe this is going to be of a Flemings or Ruths Chris caliber, but it's absolutely nothing like that. Not. Even. Close. n nI was with friends who are not foodies and don't go out nearly as much as I do, and even they were completely baffled why anyone would recommend it. I guess if you like love baseball you might enjoy going in just for the museum aspect. They certainly have a lot of balls heh and photos from the 70s. Nothing, including the cooking techniques, has been updated since then. n nWe had reservations and were seated promptly in the dining room two tables away from a large party celebrating the birthdays of a couple of small children. We immediately asked to be moved and were quickly and graciously relocated to the bar. This was fine with us, and actually was a bonus for one of our party since she had a burger from the bar menu which was the only edible meal. n nI ordered a pomegranate margarita which was undrinkable too syrupy and sweet. Others had the prickly pear margarita and they said that drink was ok. n nFirst out was the chopped liver which none of wanted so we sent it back. We had a spinach dip appetizer which was ok. I had a caesar salad, nothing special, the rest had the vinegar cole slaw which was deemed by all to be good but nothing special. n nThen came the entrees. The gal who had the burger was the only happy one, but the ""onion strings "" that came with it were a joke. Gloppy strings of over fried dough that looked to have sat out for awhile before being served. Four people had the famous ribs and proclaimed them to be dry, meatless, and impossible to eat. I had the filet trio with three different ""crusts. "" The little blobs of meat were dry and flavorless, and the ""crusts "" were just dabs of some kind of mixture that added nothing to the meat. The only one I got any flavor from was the dijon mustard one, and that was kind of overwhelming. The twice baked potatoes were huge, but so dry and tasteless. n nThis is the kind of food that was considered gourmet back in the 60s I suppose, but they seriously need to update things. I've been to throwback type places that at least serve good food. The concierge told me, politely, that they would only send their ""over 60 "" clientele there, and then she said, ""But I'm practically a senior citizen myself and I don't like it AT ALL. "" n nThis is a place you can definitely afford to miss.",1
I can appreciate a dive bar but i had mixed feelings about this place. Even so my mission was to go where the music is. n nCame on a night one of my fellow 'bay' natives was spinning which was a plus. This place is definitely contrasted by the connected bar. A pool dive bar country room judging by the patrons in it Seriously? n nMaybe this review is totally premature.maybe i shall attend another event.i keep reminding myself its about the music.someone from here convince me otherwise.,1
"I'll be honest, I haven't been to Carolina's for about a month. But my wife and I have been doing weekly take outs since they opened up the Cactus location. There is no need to order and wait you just call in your order! I always order the Machaca with egg and I have never been disappointed. I'll admit, it's quite greasy and you need to have some napkins nearby but the taste is out of this world! The food is consistent with the South Phoenix location which I had been going to for years. The prices are very reasonable especially for the product that is served. By the way, the home made tortillas are the best in Phoenix.",2
"I've been shopping at Easley's for about four years now and I love it! not only do they have everything I need for my costumes, it is also a fun and exciting place to shop. I feel like it's a sort of Disneyland for adults! n nI came here with my Mom since we are both attending my niece's costume themed wedding. the staff were very helpful and seemed to really enjoy themselves and their job. they helped my mom find the perfect Witch of Oz costume and helped me with my Marilyn Monroe costume. n nnot only do they have all the costumes you could want and need but all the accessories you could even think of. brooms, hats, jewelry, headpieces right down the witch buckles that attach to the end of your shoe! great, great fun. thanks Easley's ",2
"Decided to take the moms out for Mother's Day and as locals I came a cross this highly recommended restaurant that id actually never heard of until our visit. The interior was beautiful! I love the feeling of being in a decked out fine dining restaurant. It almost set the mood as if to be in a Gatsby movie, very elegant. The service was helpful, and the wine list couldn't have been better. The Napa Cabernet by the glass is AMAZING! I will have to call and get the name for my own satisfaction but so smooth, the perfect wine. We ordered some lobster Mac for the appetizer and it's safe to say it was a big hit at our table, the plate was basically spotless. I don't usually comment on the complimentary breads but oh my, that had to be the best pretzel bread I've ever had! I ordered the free range chicken for my entree. The food took about 40 min after ordering to be brought out to the table, I thought that was a bit long but the atmosphere was comforting enough to let it slide. When my chicken came and I cut into the juicy breast, my taste buds went crazy! It was so delicious, my mouth is watering just reciting the memory! My husband got the New York steak, of course I had to try a piece and man was it charred to perfection and so tasty! The Brussels sprouts with bacon we're great along with the asparagus, and the corn. The mashed potatoes seemed a bit plain to me, but other than that the experience couldn't have been better! To finish off dinner we all split a lemon cheesecake that made your taste buds disregard the full stomach and dig in for more. I loved the experience, the boutique, elegant, Gatsby feel. We'll be referring many friends and family!",2
"So I let it slide when you took the California turkey sandwich off the menu, but this time, I just can't overlook it. My hubby and I were craving Paradise last night, so I went in to place a to go order. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad for my hubby. The girl tells me it is no longer on the menu. ""You mean you still have the ingredients for it but it isn't on the menu anymore? "" I asked. Nope. you can't order it at all, she tells me. It is banished from the menu. My heart stopped for a minute. My hubby LOVES that salad. In his words, it is his ""soul mate salad. "" I can't even get him to eat a salad unless it is the BBQ chicken at Paradise. It's gone! How the heck am I ever going to get him to eat a salad again? n nSo I tell the girl that I have to go to the car to tell this unspeakable fact to my husband. He was not happy! He said we will never be coming back to Paradise ever again. You have lost two very loyal customers because you can't seem to keep the same thing on the menu for any extended amount of time. Does Paradise not understand that it is not a sustainable business model to change your menu every few months? It gets really annoying when you find something you like, and the next time you stop in, nothing on the menu even resembles that item. n nNot only that, but the menu above the counter no longer has any descriptions of menu items. What the heck is the Frontega Chicken sandwich? I wouldn't know because the descriptions that used to be there are gone. I shouldn't have to ask what every single sandwich consists of before I place my order. n nVenting session over. Someone needs to go back to the drawing board at Paradise Bakery and fix what's broken.",1
"been a loyal Verizon Wireless customer since 1999, so before Verizon Wireless came about. Anyhow, I was in the store for about 10 minutes looking at the Samsung Note II, no one came over to help me. Others that came in after me, they received help but not once did someone come over to see if I needed some assistance of had questions. The sales staff would just walk by me without even making eye contact. Was it because I looked young, as in i'm 27 so they assumed i was just browsing? Regardless, shame on the employees as well as the manager of the store! tsk tsk tsk!",1
"So we decided to try Wild East for takeout and ordered three specialty rolls, a traditional roll, plus an appetizer of spring rolls to feed 3 people. The woman who took our order reassured us that their specialty rolls typically had eight pieces and were ""substantial "" in size. n nWe picked up our order and it wasn't until after we got home and unpacked the food that we found two small to go containers, each of which were still large enough to contain two rolls. Both the signature rolls and the traditional roll appeared to be the same amount of food. n nI want to give Wild East credit for the fact that the hostesses were extremely nice both on the phone and when we picked up the order, and despite the quantity, the food appeared to be delicious. We were disappointed that we knew we were going to be left pretty hungry but then we realized we had just paid 50 for as much sushi as you could get for 15 at a grocery store. I knew we were paying more for quality but apparently Wild East thinks they're better than the other thirty dozen sushi bars in Charlotte that give you way more for your buck. n nThis was annoying enough for us to drive all the way back and complain. We explained that we felt misled and knowing that we didn't deserve any special treatment or free food, we simply asked that we get our money back in exchange for our uneaten order. At this point you would think that the staff would stand by their product and do at least something to retain our business and have us try them again. However the exchange consisted of sincere but awkward apologies and they watched me walk out the door, clearly knowing I would never see them again. n nWhat made the whole experience a little more distasteful was that we had called Wild East back shortly after placing our order in hopes of switching some of the rolls to brown rice. The woman on the phone politely changed everything but when we arrived to pick up the food, she told us they couldn't make our changes because the food had already been made. Again, this wasn't really their fault but we definitely didn't feel like overpaying for something we didn't even want in the first place. n nLastly as we were back in the restaurant returning our order, a man who appeared to be either a manager or owner had walked up to the hostess desk and asked what was going on. I overheard her tell him the situation but when she handed me my receipt and offered her apology, the guy didn't even acknowledge me as I walked away. n nI'm sure this place has something good to offer based on all the positive reviews here, but they didn't give me a reason to try again and find out what it is.",1
"I just tried their sandwiches for the 1st time. n nA turkey on marbled rye california style with avocado,sprouts,pickles and more. n nThe bread was not toasted and was crumbly, the turkey was kinda lame like carl budding's in the pkg for .40 at the grocery. n nfor 9 it was not very impressive. n nI will stick to the bagels schmear and the breakfast sandwiches.",1

"Okay what's the deal with the serve yourself places having family size salad bowls for individual servings? I mean really. Do I need 32 ozs of yogurt? .probably not. Okay I am exaggerating but the cups are big and there isn't another option.For two of us we filled our two bowls to the tune of 12.00 ! Oops .you can't really put that back. n nThe good news is it does have a great cool summertime taste. Not the best taste I have ever had but certainly worth stopping by once in awhile or going to on a hot day and you need a cool treat. Right across the street from Arrowhead and on the way home from Peoria Complex or theHarkins Cinema. n nThey had about 10 flavors nothing earth shaking , your standard fruits and choc, vanilla, Reeses, cheescake and Green Tea? . nI thought it would be very tart but it really wasn't very tart except my oldest said she thought the cheesecake was tart but liked it. n nThe Reese flavor was good however I have had better. The decor is modern , cheery and it feels fun. I will definitely feel good about bringing my family back but first we will go get Gelato.",2
"Good nchips and salsa nfish tacos nchicken enchilada n nNot recommend nVeggie Burrito unless you really like that kind of stuff n nThe discount meal ticket prevents you from choosing things from most of the menu. It only allows for the main dishes, all of which are around 10 or much higher. I really wanted a quesadilla as my main dish but they wouldn't apply it to it since it was considered an appetizer.",2
"I finally had a Fez burger! meh. I went away less than amazed but it was my own fault. I ordered what was popular rather than what I thought would appeal to my palate. I had a Fez burger with a side of sweet potato fries. Both the pears and the bbq sauce were sweet as was the cinnamon on the fries. For me it was just too much sweet in one dinner. What I will order next time is a different burger and I was informed I could order the sweet potato fries with just the dipping sauce without the sugar cinnamon dusting. And those fries are not the thin soggy ones I had had elsewhere, they are nice and crisp on the outside and stand up quite well on their own. The burger came out a perfect medium and I did not ask to have it less the cilantro, which I don't care for, so I could have the burger in it's normal form. I did take the cilantro off the second half. I happen to like burgers on ciabatta bread so that was fine. n nThis visit was sort of spur of the moment. I had found out where I was meeting folks for a couple of drinks that evening did not serve food and I decided food was in order first. As I was driving across town on Indian School it didn't take me long to realize how close I would be to Fez! I got there during the last 1 2 hour of happy hour and the parking lot was packed and I started wondering if I was going to be able to sit anywhere. I was greeted by Thomas, the GM, almost immediately and he asked what kind of atmosphere I wanted and I explained I was just looking to grab a quick burger on the way to someplace. He found me a spot in a quiet corner that was perfect. I had my water right away and my server showed up quickly and took my order. The wait for the food was reasonable, especially just finishing up happy hour. My server stopped by on a regular basis and Thomas came by just as I was finishing to hear any comments I had. n nI went away happy I had chosen Fez for dinner.",2
"Those guys are the worst on the street. Staff and the manger Jason are Ridiculous, Rude, and attitude all the way. I will never step in to this place with the way how they do things. I don't know how they would hire those idiots to run this place",1
"This place is dirt cheap! I usually spend about 80 for two people when I go here whereas I usually spend 160 at Copps or Hyvee. They have a huge selection of everything, I can find things here that I can't find at other grocery stores, like low sodium string cheese and certain veggie burgers. Yes, it has some flaws, it can be a zoo on the weekend and can be a bit messy, but the price and selection is worth it. The only true complaint I have is the produce can be pretty crappy. Sometimes I have to go somewhere else if I need a lot of produce or certain things that I know will be bad at Woodmans. And no, they don't take credit but they do take debit which is just fine for me.",2
"Mums was a great experience for a tourist! n nThe service is fantastic the servers are soo friendly! And the best part of course, is that the food is fantastic and the lunches 5 pounds are such a good deal! n nThe lunch comes with a soup and a main. I had the macaroni and cheese, with the tomato soup. It was filling, and delicious comfort food. I also had the genius to get the milkshake marked as ""AMAZING "" on the menu, the gingerbread. Seriously it was amazing. If you go to Mums, you should check out this milkshake. n nMy more daring friend decided to try the meat Haggis, and though it was scary, it ended up being delicious sort of like. more flavorful ground beef so if you want to try it in a less intimidating environment, I recommend Mums! n nAs someone who came to the UK fearing high prices, Mums is definitely a pleasant and delicious experience.",2
"Mystere. With the reputation of being the best circus in the world I had high expectations for this show. And they were all fulfilled. nBeing my first Cirque show, I didn't know what acts to expect. The ones they showed were amazing and defied the laws of human nature. nThe show was composed of comedy lots of it and suspense even more of it . With the perfect cast and months, even years of training, there were few mistakes that only few could have seen. nWith a great show comes great planning. There must always be a plan B if something doesn't go as planned. Though there were few mistakes, most even unnoticeable, they acted as if nothing happened and went to the second option smoothly. nThey had an act of testing the true strength of man. Two men performing the ultimate test of strength and balance was the highlight of my night. With veins and brute force popping from their sexy chiseled bodies, i couldn't help but wonder how much training they put into the act. This act was truly an inspiration to boys and men everywhere to get off their butts and to start going to the weight room. nWith the humor of the big baby and the man in the suit at random scene changes, this show was truly worth my family's payment. nGo watch Mystere now at Vegas baby!",2
"The hostess and ID checker were very helpful in helping us chose a good tequila, that is the only nice thing i'll say about this place. The 2 bartenders ladies were unfriendly and unhelpful, just plain snotty .

They arrived twenty minutes earlier then anticipated on a Monday afternoon. Which is great! Pizza was yummy big Italian sausage. Garden salad OK but was hoping for a little more then just tomatoes and cheese with croutons. Perhaps some olives and a slice or two of red onion would be good. The gentleman on the phone was very pleasant which I appreciate. It's nice to talk to someone who seems to genuinely like their job. This is second round of ordering since moving here and I'm happy to have a good pizza place around. Thanks!,2
"Upon walking in you feel like you are at a flea market restaurant with hodge podge tables and chairs and no air conditioning. The menu was on a chalk board, and the sodas were canned. Don't get me wrong, all of these things can be OK, and even be a draw to the restaurant, but only if the food can back it. Overall, this food did not back it. I had the pulled pork sandwich. The meat was good, but the bun seemed as though it had just been pulled from the bag it was bought at walk mart in. n nNow, there is one thing about this restaurant I enjoyed. The spicy BBQ sauce is out of this world! I covered my sandwich in that and was set! n nMy final verdict is that if you seriously want BBQ and there is nowhere else around to get some, this place will work, however for the money, you could go elsewhere and get a higher quality in a more comfortable setting.",1
"This was the perfect place to stop by for happy hour on Friday night. There was actually a mix of locals with us tourists.prob 'cause the cheap drinks selected food at the bar. It's a pretty small place, with a nice outdoor patio that has a straight shot of the Pirate show at T.I. across the street. It seems kinda hidden too. There's a direct entrance off the sidewalk along the strip and one right off the main entrance to Palazzo.",2
"This was my first Korean Chinese Mexican fusion experience! and I loved it D n nI'll get right to the point CHEAP, DELICIOUS, SIMPLE n nI had the BUL GOGI BEEF FRIED RICE BOWL 6.99 okay so the flavor was ""eh "" in fact, it didn't have much flavor, but for the price, they give you enough for lunch, dinner, and lunch again. I mean the portions were huge. I would get this plate again ONLY because if you pour a little Korean sauce on it it tastes delicious! n nMy BF had a taste of the Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Fish tacos loaded with tasty toppings and only 1.29 each not bad. The final verdict was PORK tacos, YUM. The fish taco was tasty but they put sour cream when it might have tasted better with a creative fish sauce or ""KoMex fusion "" sauce of some sort just sayin. n nMUST TRY the BULGogi Nacho Fries OMG soooo goood! n nWhile you're waiting they give you a side of chips, salsa, and guacamole and no tap water for these peeps it's bottled water all the way baby! n nThe restaurant itself is small and it seemed super busy during the lunch hour. The service was mediocre but the waitress was friendly and helpful for us first time customers ",2
I was trying compare to the Wynn since that is my favorite. n nI think M Resort Studio B Buffet has a wider selection and if you are into beer and wine that is a nice touch. n nThe dessert is definitely better here. And there is a espresso cappuccino bar not sure what Wynn has . n nAnyways everyone in my group liked it. My wife liked this place better than the Wynn. I think it was about even for me. Definitely one of the better places. And their asian food is much better than the Wynn. It actually has a really wide selection whereas the Wynn just had some potstickers and a few other things .,2
We had a great time Carl was awesome scenery great and menu also outstanding enough food for 4 more. A credit to the NY location.,2
"I had the best time of the month at any Tweetup inside of the MGM sponsored event at the Skylofts. Entry happened in a secluded area downstairs, near where the taxi's are waiting to pick people up. Outside is the recognizable stretched Maybach limo that shuttles people from the hotel to Aria or where ever the guest would like to go. From there, you are directed to another secluded area to the left of the main hotel check in. Once inside, you'll find many individual tables with super knowledgeable staff that prepare your room and butlers for your arrival. They make sure to go over details like what time you would like food delivered to your room, what drinks you like and if you need any help setting up your clothes in the suite's closet. n nThe Tweetup was held in one of the corner suites on the 29th floor that faced the corner of Excalibur, Tropicana and the New York New York. It had several levels inside and outside on the terrace, complete with a hot tub. n nInside of the suite included a sunken living area with steps up to the kitchen and bar areas, an entry foyer linked to the kitchen and finally a media room with billiards. The entire suite included Bang Olufsen video and audio technology. n nUpstairs was complete with two bedrooms and a workout area in the master. The bathrooms upstairs inside of each bedroom were equipped with infinity edge bathtubs and steam showers, big enough for several people. Between the two bedrooms was a generously sized study that could accommodate the busiest of professionals. n nIf given the opportunity to visit the MGM Skylofts again, I would clear my schedule to make that happen. The butler service during the Tweetup was amazing, each person is equipped with secret service style headsets and can deployed at any given moment. The guest service they provided was fitting to that level of luxury.",2

I will never go to any other lash salon or practitioner in Las Vegas. n nI'm from Seattle where my lash extortionist was honest and professional, taking time and care of my lashes, always without fail, applying lash by lash as well as stressing the importance of proper care and maintenance. When I moved to LV in Aug 2011 I went to at least 4 different lash practitioners email me and I'll tell you who , who lied repeatedly to my face about doing lash by lash, while their technique was layering lashes on top of lashes, gluing lashes together, putting glue all over my eyelids to simulate eyeliner and eventually ruining my natural lashes and causing allergic reactions from the glue. I was about to stop getting extensions when I decided to try cherry lash as a last resort. My lashes have been perfectly applied ever since, just like what I was use to I'm Seattle. n nI started by going to Suejey sp? Pronunciation Sue hey and now I since July 2012 I've been seeing Linda because her schedule works best for me . Both ladies are amazing at their job, as I'm sure the rest of the extortionists are. n nI highly recommend Cherry Lash for the integrity of their work, honesty and kindness. n nIf you go anywhere else in the city I promise you will regret it.",2
Manny was great! On time toilet was fixed right the first time! nPrice was very reasonable too! I would highly recommend him. nThanks Manny!,2
"I don't feel like these other reviews are real. In any case, here is mine n nI've been meaning to post this review for almost a year now. n nI took my vehicle in to replace the bumper and fender. They did a good job with painting the new parts and installation was mostly okay, staff was friendly, but that's where it ends n n1. The paint was slightly smeared on a crease that separates the unpainted bumper from the painted section. It just looks sloppy. When I asked them about this, they shrugged. n2. They left some plastic wrap material that prevented overspray in the passenger front door. n3. They did not reconnect parts of the door panel. n4. The fender did not align with the bumper properly they said they could do nothing about it and that I would have to take the fender back to the Nissan dealership. n nI decided to pay for these repairs out of pocket, so there was no insurance company with whom to complain. I wish I had just made a claim on my own insurance to have peace of mind. I've found Yelp reviews to be generally accurate, this is why question the other reviews. I don't understand how my experience can be so different from the other reviewers'.",1
"No complaints about the food whatsoever. All of us were more than happy with our meals. Steaks and side dishes creamed spinach, blue cheese scalloped potatoes were great, as were the duck fat fries. Only knocked down a star because you should never, ever have to listen to Carl Douglas' ""Kung Fu Fighting "" while eating in a steakhouse. Otherwise, a great experience.",2
"On Friday night we had dinner at Tommy V's Osteria Pizzeria, across from the Biltmore Fashion Park at 32nd St. and Camelback. It's a relatively new spin off of Tomaso's Restaurant which has been at that location for 32 years. Where Tomaso's is upscale, dressier, and heavy on the proteins, Tommy V is casual and carb oriented. It's interesting that the prices on most of the appetizers, salads and pastas are pretty much the same at both locations. n n Tommy V's is divided up into two rooms. You enter the bar area which also houses an open kitchen with wood burning pizza oven. It's light filled and colorful. and also very loud. The second room is more sedate, and unfortunately somewhat gloomy. It's dimly lit, and the faux brick, dark wood, and taupe painted walls don't help. There are some windows cut into the front and back walls, framed with curtains, which look into the bar area, and a third back room. Very weird. However, the gloom was dispelled when our cheerful waitress brought us a basket of crusty bread and some fabulous pesto butter, redolent of garlic. She informed us that happy hour was on from 5 7 , and we could get most of the wines on the menu for 5 a glass or 20 a bottle. We decided to share a glass of red Primitivo 'Layer Cake' I don't know why it was called that, but you knew that I wouldn't be able to resist ordering it . It turned out to be delicious, rich and deeply fruity. Because we had arrived quite early I didn't know how busy the restaurant would be and reservations are only taken for tables of 6 we ordered a roasted beet and goat cheese salad 8 while we awaited our friends Walt and Maria. While it was quite good, it didn't live up to the one we had at The Parlor since the beets weren't multi colored and the dressing didn't have as much zing. However, there was lots of cheese and toasted pistachios. n n When Walt and Maria arrived, our bread basket and carafe of butter was swiftly refilled the bussing was top notch . I suggested that they try the Primitivo, and they ordered the Romaine Wedge salad 7 with bacon and gorgonzola. It was beautifully presented, with a pile of whole romaine leaves holding the accompaniments and dressing. All the salad ingredients were quite fresh. I ordered an Eggplant Torta 15 , described as ""Baked Multi layer of Eggplant, Cheese Fondue, Pasta "". Ken opted for V's Kick Ass Burger 9 oz 12 ""Handcrafted with Short Rib, Brisket Kobe Beef, Caramelized Onions, Heirloom Tomatoes, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Arugula, Truffle Aioli Parmesan Herb Roasted Potatoes "". The combination of meats made this too interesting to pass up. Walt and Maria decided to share a pizza. These are ""personal size "", 10 12 inches, and range in price from 10 for a Margherita with mozzarella and tomatoes to n 16 for a Proscuitto and Fig pie with gorgonzola and arugula. Unfortunately I don't remember what kind they had, but they said they enjoyed it, and it was actually big enough that 2 pieces were taken home. The burger was great. It was big and juicy with a fascinating texture because of the short ribs and brisket it's now my favorite Phoenix burger, and the price is comparable to the other good ones served elsewhere. Ken loved the roasted potatoes, and while they were flavorful, I prefer nice crunchy fries. My eggplant torta was a pleasant, non confrontational variant of eggplant parmesan. But having taken a Zantac, I was looking forward to confrontation a spicy sauce and loads of gooey cheese. This was disappointing, but edible. It was also a fairy small portion. n n There were no surprises on the dessert menu tiramisu, cannoli, etc. We ordered a tartufo for the table. When it arrived, nicely sliced, there was none of the zablione promised on the menu. I asked the waitress about that and she tried to tell me that it had been ""mixed in "". When I gave her a skeptical, unhappy look she brought over the owner manager I'm not sure which he was , and he apologized, saying that there's been a dispute with the distributor over that item. We weren't charged for it, which was very nice, since we did eat it all. n n The parking in front of the restaurant is limited, but Walt said to tell you that immediately to the east of the strip mall containing the restaurant there's a large parking lot, not particularly visible to the street. All in all I'd say this was a good dining experience and we'll go back to try some of the interesting pastas like braised short rib gnocchi 20 or butternut squash ravioli with amaretto cookies, toasted almonds and parmigiano sage sauce 15 . And especially to have another burger!",2
"I too do not understand what all the hype is about. We went for a weekday breakfast and I would not go back. nThe line moved quickly. The interior is totally kitschy and what you would expect. nWe tried nBanana and Nutella Crepe Crepe was doughy and not authentic surprise surprise , banana filling was cold. nBagel with Lox No cream cheese or sliced tomatoes available, bagel was hard, salmon was good with just goat cheese, capers, tomatoes from salad bar and red onion alone. nMushroom Omelet. More scrambled than omelet and overcooked nEggs Benedict Took one look and walked away. gloppy looking mess. nFresh fruit was great nCoffee was good nOrange juice was great how can you screw up oj? nSausage was flavorful and juicy. but again cold! n nI guess if we're paying for breakfast we expect it to be better than I can make at home. We mostly took a few bites of our selection and left it alone. I wish we would have skipped the buffet and just picked up oatmeal at Starbucks. it was that bad. n nThe waitress was good and very busy. She forgot to bring us coffee cups but that was easily fixed.",1
Great convenience store.,2
"One of the bartenders at our hotel recommended the Hanging Bat for craft beer. We were lucky enough to grab a spot on the couch downstairs. The Bat has a extensive list of beers and a surprisingly good food menu. After a few pints we decided to try the pulled pork nachos, spicy wings, and the beer mac n' cheese. I have to say that I everything that we tried was delicious and much better than I would expect for ""pub food. "" n nThe Bat was definitely one of my favorite places during our trip to Edinburgh!",2
I ended up going to the restaurant because I was looking for a nice meal that wasn't going to cost my left arm on my last night in Montreal. This was perfect. n nI called ahead and made a reservation for two but we ended up picking up a third on our way. The restaurant was slow that night so it was a non issue but based on how friendly the staff was I don't think it would have been on a busy night. n nI ordered the salmon with cream sauce. It came with a salad and desert for an incredibly reasonable price. I had a couple glasses of wine with my sister and our new friend. The food was perfect. My salmon was cooked just right and was just the right amount of food. The deserts were even lovelier. I split my poached pear with my sister's hazelnut pound cake and it was great. You will get a lot of delicious food for your money here. n nOur waiter was wonderful. He was very helpful and incredibly nice. He chatted with our table a bit and explained a few customs to me that I hadn't quite figured out yet. n nI will be back. I loved this place.,2
"I popped in to have a quick lunch and quite enjoyed the atmosphere and food. The salmon was cooked perfectly a little extra pink in the middle. I am docking one star because I think my meal was a touch overpriced. 28 for 5 asparagus spears, a beer, about 7 oz salmon, and about a cup of grits. Seems like island prices to me! Was tasty though.",2
"The Place is Beautiful,the rooms are Nice.BUT the Service is Like 1 Star Hotel. nFrom the A c in the Room,you Can't put it under 20c bec will Leak,to the Room service you Call Them they come after 30 min no kidding,To the Elevator it doen't work all the time,to the Internet in the rooms is like you Have internet Coming form Japan u waiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiT for the Connections. n nI'm really Sorry But it's not worth 50 Night.",1
Should've known by the name America that this place was not going to be good. Not traditional at all skip this place.,1
"Really good food,but spotty service. The lasagna is amazing! The service is very inconsistent.",2
"I'll preface this by saying that I am SO grateful that this place exists. While I will always prefer the relationship that I have with my regular vets, having access to a sophisticated facility like this in an emergency situation is amazing. n nI have had to bring my dogs here 4 times. One was so many years ago that I barely remember. The other three have been in the past 2 years. The first time, I came home and my dogs gums were white, and rushed her in. She had immune mediated hemolytic anemia and was nearly dead. Dr. O'Dea thoroughly explained what was happening, told us our options, outlined a plan, and did not give us any false hope. Somehow, he kept her alive through the night. That night, combined with the care she received at my regular vet, we managed to have another months with her. She ended up dying from very strange complications from the medications she was taking, but everyone fought for her amazingly. n nThe other two times, one of my dogs bit the other one and he needed care, and we had a suspected potential poisoning where he managed to get ahold of a bunch of highly caffeinated tea. Both times, he was well taken care of. After the poisoning, we were given some options of things they could do just in case leave him there overnight, leave him on fluids, etc , but the doctor said he'd be just fine with us at home. n nWith both the immune issue and the maybe poisoning, we received calls the following day from the vet to follow up and check in. n nSo why do I have a 4 out of 5? When I went in for the poisoning incident at the advice of animal poison control, who let them know we were coming , it took quite a while for them to actually take my dog back and have a look at him. He was a small 15 pound dog, and he ate a LOT like. several ounces of some of the most highly caffeinated tea on earth. Not everything is so time sensitive. the bite? Not so much. But a poisoning? In my opinion, you look at that right away, and it took waaaay too long before they looked at him. Fortunately, he was fine at the end of the day, but I was definitely not happy about that. Will I still take my dogs there if needed? Yes. Overall, they are great.",2
"A perfect Andalusian night in Las Vegas! n nWent to Jaleo on Aug 25 2014 during the Las Vegas Restaurant week party of 3 and was able to enjoy the following 9 course meal for only 50.14! A great deal all made better by our amazing server Mario L who was super attentive to my wife's food allergies and double checked everything to make sure we were fine. Atmosphere was great, on the louder side but the Spanish guitar playing in the background went perfect with the flavors and aromas of the night. n nI have reviewed each menu item briefly below, but the overall experience was amazing, transported us to our various Tapas experiences throughout Spain in Seville, Marbella, Madrid, Barcelona and Ibiza. n nFOOD n1. Aceitunas Rellenas Olives stuffed with anchovy and piquillo nThese where great, very different, I usually don't like anchovies that much but you couldn't even taste them, there was an orange paste on the olives. n n2. Melon con Jamon Serrano Cantaloupe with Serrano ham nThis was amazing, thinly shaved melon with freshly cut Serrano toped with olive oil and edible flowers. Perfect! n n3. Calamares a la Romana Fried fresh calamari with garlic alioli nI am not too crazy about friend calamari but these were probably one of the best freshest ones I have had outside of spain Portugal Italy or anywhere surrounded by sea! n n4. Endibias con queso de cabra ya naranjas Endives, goat cheese, oranges and almonds nSimple and flavorful, they literally pop in your mouth as the crunchiness of the endives meets the sweetness of the orange and the creaminess of the goat cheese. n n5. Ajo blanco malague u00f1o Malaga style chilled almond soup with crab, grapes, raisins and almonds nThis was ridiculously good! 10 10 never tasted anything quite like it, it was the consistency of a more liquid hummus but with a light almond flavor, the resins grapes and the crab balanced the whole dish into an exceptional culinary experience that I didn't know was possible by having what is basically a cold soup! n n6. Judias con romesco y Ca u00f1a de Cabra Green beans with romesco and Ca u00f1a de Cabra cheese nLightly grilled or pan friend French beans with goat cheese, excellent and again, something different from what you normally expect from French beans n n7. Pepito de Ib u00e9rico Mini burger with Ib u00e9rico bacon, caramelized onion, piquillos and alioli nThis was tasty and rich. Loved the smokiness of the Iberico with the juiciness of the beef and the roasted pepper. n n8. Paella del d u00eda The best known dish in Spanish cuisine, made in our open fire, wood burning n10 10! Again, Absurdly good! This was a vegetable Paella and it was hands down one of the best executions of a paellas I have ever had! The rice, the sauce and the consistency of all the ingredients were perfect. Made me REALLY curious about how good their seafood paellas can be! n n9. Sorbetes Caseros Con 'carquinyolis' House made sorbet with a traditional Catalan crisp nRedcurrant sorbet, a perfect end to a wonderful meal, had a hint of mint basil, even though there was no mint or Basil used in it! Which apparently what you get when you have incredibly fresh redcurrants! n nThis was a 9 courses meal but the ingredients are so fresh and the preparation is so great that we didn't feel full or uncomfortable. n nDRINKS nI tasted 2 different Gin and Tonics, the Sangria and a glass of wine. n nGrowing up in UK and visiting Spain many, many times in my life, I consider myself a bit of a ""Gin Tonic "" connoisseur as its called in Spain . In fact I would love to meet Jose Andres over some Gin Tonics and discuss how to perfect this drinks which happens to be my favorite. Come on guys, you can make it happen! n nFrom the Ice a perfectly clear sphere, which is hard to make and is apparently shipped in from California! to the choice of Tonic , the herbs and spices and the Gin itself, both the Jose's and the Citrico Gin Tonics where Great. n nLets put it this way, this isn't your grandma's Gin Tonic and it's a must try if you visit Jaleo. n nEnjoy your visit at Jaleo, I know we did",2

"Trying the Turkey Sand rage! n nSeven stars for the Turkey Sandwich. One star for the staff. I hate writing bad reviews but where on earth are restaurants hiring their staff from lately?

"I agree with Arthur D there is definitely a bit of a renaissance going on in the bar scene in Edinburgh at the mo'. Lots of dodgy boozers being transformed into something more upmarket. nI've yet to try the cocktail bar through the back I haven't eaten here yet either. Must try both any excuse to go back again . Each time I've been in, it's been for a drink on the way home from being up town. The bar staff are friendly, there's a good selection of beers on tap and in bottle, which is a winner with the OH, the house wine is good, which is a winner with me. It's definitely going to be my new local and I'm looking forward to many more visits in the months to come.",2
"Funny little hole in the wall that I found interesting.I would always see a bunch of Chinese people outside smoking on my way home. If I didnt see it, I would think to write it off as one of those cheap fast food Chinese counters. I asked my BF about it and he said that long ago when we worked in the area his coworker would often have to order for them there in Chinese.he even sent my BF with a little note when he had to pick up. n nAnyways, I do really like the food here. I know I'm not Chinese but part of my family is my half brothers are, my godfather is Chinese and we went to Hong Kong to visit him so I grew up on a lot of authentic foods.this is authentic and everything we've gotten has been really good. No ""just okay "" foods mixed in with standouts everything has been home cooking authentic. n n I think it's funny though how a lot of authentic places kinda treat us ignorant. Me looking like an Asian, but not quite easy to place and my gweilo BF I suppose don't look like lovers of the OG dishes. Like BF went to pick up food for us once and ordered half Ginger Scallion Chicken once and they thought they better tell this whitey ""has bone. it okay? "" hahaha. I get it though, I've seen some funny exchanges of dumbasses who think this is Panda Express. Before my BF ordered the guy had an exchange with a father and son all mad that Fried Rice is a la carte and doesnt come with orange chicken like it does at Panda Express so they left. It probably helped that dudes frustrations with Gwailos extend to us. n nSaying Hello in Canto helps before I order. n nFood wise, this is probably my favorite Chinese spot. It's so much like home.Salty Fish Fried Rice is comfort at its best, Salt and Pepper Pork chops here are the best I've had in Vegas, mmm eggplant hotpot is soo delicious, Walnut shrimp is great and its cheap compared to everywhere else! , duck is crispy skinned yet juicy and tender meat, veggies with XO sauce is bomb, salty egg pork was comfort for me though BF did not like, Chow fun was so perfectly cooked and flavored and I dont even really like Chow Fun! I'm done listing because I'll probably have a comment for everything on the menu. n nYeah I cannot wait whenever we say we're coming here to eat as I can always find something that hits that comfort spot and this spot in me that gets warm thinking about childhood foods. I love that feeling and I have gotten that everytime so far.",2
"Two words. Time. Efficient. n nMy sister and I ordered a medium cheese pizza for pick up. We were told it would take 15 minutes and after arriving at the restaurant, we were handed our freshly baked pizza 15 minutes on the dot after we called. Little things like accurate time approximations keep customers happy and coming back and Stevie's has that down.",2
Nope not a fan of this place! Pizza was OK but for sure not worth the price! I wouldn't venture back here anytime soon. This place is at the cosmo hotel and casino 3rd floor. Lucky i didn't have to wait in long lines. I ate half of the pizza and the rest in the trash.,1
"Attractive, fun, and super helpful staff! Tried so many places and flavors.never was content until I discovered Puff Vapors! Highly recommend them. Thanks guys!",2
"First off this is by no means authentic Mexican food. Was looking forward to trying a new Mexican restaurant and was highly disappointed. The salsa they give you was really watery and is too spicy for children to eat which our waitress failed to mention. Our waitress was young somewhat friendly but more awkward. Food wasn't good, tacky decor and awkward service. First and last time",1
We have been here a few times and it's pretty darn good! Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable of the food. I love their prime rib and crab while my boyfriend's loves the baseball cut steak. We're going here for Valentine's next week so we're excited to return!,2
"One of my favorite steaks. Went there a few weeks ago while in AZ for spring training. We wanted to go to Mastros but couldn't get in at a decent hour with a last minute reservation. Donovan's got us in no problem and I'm very happy about it. The restaurant was well appointed and classy but not too stuffy. We were seated upon arrival by extremely friendly hostesses. The waiter immediately took our drink order and struck up a conversation about baseball and our favorite team owner who often frequents the restaurant. He was very nice to my 8 and 11 year old kids and wasn't put off by them. The waiter and his assistants took great care of us, made sure our water was always full but did not overwhelm us. My son and I shared the largest filet which was perfectly cooked to order and simply delicious as were the scalloped potatoes. My wife had an incredibly delicious salmon and my daughter had Mac n cheese side with bacon that was to die for. My martini was icy cold and the wine pours were generous. Although a bit pricey Donovan's was definitely with it.",2
If i could give this 0 stars i would! This place is a joke i go here 4 times a week n they probably get my order right maybe once! Not only do they tell you 15 20 min and you end up there waiting another 30 mins on top of your 15 20! Even the manager is pathetic Lee Lund is her name and if you have worked in this business like i do you realize your customers come first! She has a terrible attitude and her employees match just that. It sucks i have to go here so much but i love the wings at any bww despite the service! Ive lived by this bww for 3 years now and this by far is the WORST YEAR!,1
"I just want to say I would be careful about purchasing any coupons affiliated with this restaurant. I bought an entertainment book as a donation to my childs school less than a month ago. The coupons do not expire until November of 2012. However, when I went inside the establishment they said they were not longer honoring the coupons. How can they do that? I can only come to the conclusion that they are promoting coupons to get the advertising but cannot actually afford to honor their coupons.",1
"There is no question that this man is extremely talented and that his impressions are very good. However, the show was extremely cheesy and I got sick of his fake smile very fast. He puts on a sincere and genuine act that is very easy to see through. n nBefore the show starts, a photographer runs around taking photos of your group so that she can sell them to you after the show. n nYou won't enjoy this show if you are unfamiliar with American music ranging from the 40s to the 70s and you probably won't enjoy this show if you don't like doing the YMCA dance.",1
"I understand compromises must be made when making cakes without flour must add lots of sugar . That being said, the 3 10 inch cakes I ordered for a party turned out well, but not great. n nOf the 3 cakes I ordered 1 carrot cake with cheese cake icing, 2 chocolate cake with raspberry filling and chocolate icing, and 3 almond cake with vanilla icing and sprinkled with slivered almonds the chocolate cake turned out best. n nI was pleased with the cakes' taste, but most disappointed with the way they are decorated.

I wish i would have read the reviews because on reviewer Bobby H. nailed it right on the head. The most disappointing part is the bread. It does not have the ablitliy to hold up to the steaming meat causing the bread to just get absolutely soft and mushy. A nice Italian bread is definitely in need. Another thing needed is a good sharp provolone cheese. The meat is good but seems to be missing some seasoning but i'm just nitpicking here. One major plus is that they have crinkle fries.yahoo! It's hard to find so it's always bonus to have.,1

"Even if there are yoga studios that are nearer my place, I don't mind driving 14 miles to Yoga Hive. The studio is well appropriated and I have not met a teacher that I feel remotely lukewarm about. They each have their different teaching styles, but they all work out for me. Everyone is warm and welcoming, and questions and modifications are always welcomed. I also love how each class is not exactly the same as the one before it. Keeps my mind sharp and more attuned to my body at moment.",2
"My husband was so excited to try this place out. And it was good starting out greeted by cute, friendly hostesses, fun decor ambience, and then the food arrives. n nMy husband got the lobster roll said the bread to lobster ratio was way off. My son got the chili I know it's on the appetizer list, but it's 10 and the portion was laughably small. My son's 5, and he was frustrated at how little he got. My daughter got the duck buns I should've known better than to order duck buns at a pub, my fault. Not good at all. Finally, I got the mussels. Small, sandy, and there were at least 3 that just did not taste right. so much so that I actually warned my husband that if I were to get food poisoning later that night, the mussels would be to blame. Ugh. n nSo when we had finally trudged through our bad food guess the small portions weren't such a bad thing after all , and then we got a huge bill at the end that just seemed way overpriced for the quality of the food we got, it just added insult to injury. We really regretted wasting a perfectly good meal opportunity there, and won't ever go back again.",1
"HORRIBLE ""HOTEL "". My friends and I came to stay the weekend and boy was that a terrible idea. n n It's valet only. There's a hotel parking lot across the street but you will have to quickly run across since it's right off the exit of the freeway. Not a safe place to leave your car parked, especially if you're getting back late at night. n Unique decor, but extremely dark. Wouldn't hurt to turn on a light or two. n Only 1 elevator that takes an hour to get you to your room and down. n Our room was not serviced after our first night. n Called front desk numerous times and could not get through and had to personally go downstairs to request for fresh towels. n Waited an hour and still no towels. One of our girls had to shower using a dirty towel. n This place is known for their after hour club which we were completely unaware of and you can clearly hear the techno music from the 3rd floor pounding away. Extremely difficult to relax after a long day with all that going on. n Bouncer was VERY rude with a extremely bad attitude and would not let us back into the hotel even after standing with us while we were waiting on our cab a few hours before. n nAgain, this place is known for their after hours. However, their guests which are PAYING CUSTOMERS cannot be forgotten and treated like S . I will not be returning to the Artisan and I will not recommend anyone to stay the night at this hotel.",1
worth the Cheap rate 70 night and just a place to crash. Walk to other hotels for shows and restaurants esp. MGM.,1

"I mean. the food is edible. but everything seems to be pretty dry.

Seems every cicis pizza I go to their having a ""bad day "" or something. I haven't had a good experience yet. Sorry. Just being honest.",1
"Some of these previous low ratings surprise me, as my wife and I have been eating here for years. I have never had them limit refills on drinks ever. One waiter is not nearly as efficient as the others but he is the only one. nThis is not a Tex Mex joint so if you want their best do not order chimi's, enchiladas or fajitas. They have many other excellent choices. May I suggest combinations plates number 15 and 34 they are always superb. For the week day lunch special I always order the beef alambra tacos. The bacon puts them over the top. The Queso appetizers are artery clogging but excellent.",2
"Cooking is my passion and I just love being in front of a stove. However, I don't think the stove likes me as much as I like him. When ever I cook, the food taste decent and good. But hours later, my stomach just doesn't seem to sit well. So, because of this I've resorted to microwavable foods. My mind is saying, thank you technology for the microwave and for the chefs who created microwaved foods. n nConsidering I'm closer to an Albertson's, Smith's, or a Walmart I've chosen these grocery stores for my quick meals. However, it just wasn't good enough and felt sick just at the thought of what they sell. I even ended up resorting to McDonald's daily until I really got ill. I don't know why I didn't even think about Trader Joe's but I'm glad my brain finally decided to function and point me in the right direction. n nAs always, service is awesome, the employees are always friendly, and very considerate of their patrons. I'm convinced the management knows how to choose their associates they're all just welcoming, as I have mentioned in my previous review. n nImmediately, I go to the frozen microwaved food section and the selection they have is just phenomenal. Here are some of the products I've purchased nButter Chicken bomb! nChicken Pot Pie awesome! nBeef and Potatoes spectacular! nQuiche delectable! nStir Fry Noodles passable nSheppard's Pie just OK. nPulled Pork I'm in HEAVEN! n nThey do have other food that are awesome, but this was my main objective. So, if you're feeling lazy or you just can't seem to get your cooking skills right like me just head on down to Trader Joe's on Decatur and Oakey. You will not be disappointed.",2
"After my previous experience, I was comfortable going back. The dealer mentioned that my front brakes needed to be replaced and it would cost 209. I called Sun Devil and they had a 139 special. I took my SUV in and dropped it off. I got a call an hour later saying the drums needed to be replaced. It would now be 350. I told them that the dealer never mentioned anything wrong with the brakes just a few days ago. I told them not to do anything then. I got a call back from the manager saying I didn't have to replace the drums but it was recommended. I said just do the pads for 139 as I originally requested. They did but I think the Drums were an unnecessary upsell that most people would have no choice but to say okay.",1
"This pizza is BOMB, period. n nIMO, it's kinda cool that it's pretty much a hole in the wall and that they don't advertise it. One of those exclusive things where you have to know about it through word of mouth. Almost as if it were my own little secret. n nAs far as for you negative Nancys comparing this plave to NY. Get a grip, it's not New York, it's Las Vegas. You will never get NY pizza anywhere but NY. It's like going to NY to a casino idk if they have them or not and say well these arn't like Las Vegas.duuhhh.",2
I agree with Dean! This place is kick ass! It's not your average modern club vibe. It seems like a lounge with an old school brothel feel the way the bathrooms are laid out in the club. And the individual lounging booths are great for socializing with people in. And the music was pretty decent for dancing to. Drinks are not ridiculously expensive as in some of the other clubs. n nWednesday nights they close at 6am. And we shut the place down. n nI really enjoy this place as a night club because it's a bit more laid back and not very pretentious and it's just a good place to go to have a good time.,2
"I wanted to just write reviews for places I think are awesome but wow. I really have to warn people about this place! n nYelp did not lie to me, I should have trusted what people said here. This buffet has possibly some of the worst food I've ever had. Stay farrrr away! They even messed up HOT DOGS. They just sit there, soaking in liquids for who knows how long. Hard boiled eggs are tough like rocks and scrambled eggs are cold and unpleasantly mushy. The seafood pasta was bland. And all the breads and donuts and pastries were stale! I know Circus Circus is a bit of a walk from the Strip and this buffet is cheaper than others but it's worth the energy and money to go elsewhere! Even Hometown Buffet dumps on this place. n nSeriously, my boyfriend will eat anything and even he is turning up his nose. BAD BAD BAD.",1
"Good food and better than average service in the heart of Montreal's Village area Quartier Latin . Try the Chateaubriand for two or my favorite, a rib steak. They'll bring you fries until you pop if you don't tell them to stop. n nDon't forget to get a bottle of wine and take it with you before you go SAQ, the liquor store in Quebec, is a block west of the restaurant.",2
"We went to this newly opened restaurant with high hope as its advertised manual showed all famous dishes from the Shaanxi province in western China. Unfortunately, our enthusiasm was quickly diminished by the poorly prepared cooked dishes. The chief over used spices to hide the poor quality lamb meat he used in the dishes. The BBQ lamb was so tough that was not eatable. Ground lamb was used instead of whole piece of lamb to reduce cost for the owner.The service was very poor as well by the inexperienced water and waitresses. I have to say we will not go back to this place, once was enough.",1
"This is the only place that my Japanese BIL will go for Chinese, outside of his own kitchen. The food is quite amazing, but the atmosphere leaves a little to be desired explaining the four stars . n nTheir menu is HUGE and they don't just have your run of the mill Chinese. Although I've never been bold enough to try some of the more authentic dishes, I have seen some of the most amazing things come out of the kitchen! Whole fish flash fried and served up like filleted works of art, ducks with their heads on ala A Christmas Story , vegetables that I don't know the names of, and platters of sizzling noodles topped with exotic sauces. Most dishes can be made to your liking if you are put off by spicy, but my preference is for the full flavored versions. n nThe dining area is one large room and is sometimes a little on the warm side. Take out can solve this, but I think you actually get more when you eat in, so I generally stay and take home the leftovers. Service is typically fast and always friendly as it is a family run establishment that even the kids are involved in. Portions are family style and although you can easily get away with a meal under 10 per person, 12 to 15 will guarantee you a veritable feast! n nI typically base my reviews of ethnic establishments on the percentage of patrons that share the same background and Big Wong's is a mainstay for the Asian community here in Phoenix. Next time you are in the area, stop in, order a poo poo platter he he I said poo poo and prepare for a feast of the sensations.",2
"My boyfriend and I came here for one of our very first dates and since then have come back to 300 East often for special occassions. We request the same booth each time, and have yet to have a bad experience. until last night. n nWe had dinner at 300 East yesterday evening to celebrate my birthday. After being seated, we ordered drinks and my boyfriend let our waiter, Michael, know it was my birthday as he was looking at my ID. The point here is that he knew it was a special occassion. n nOur appetizer came and was great, however when our meal came my gorgonzola filet was so undercooked that it was actually unappetizing. We waited for Michael to return, however after about ten minutes finally had to walk up to the bar to flag down a waiter to send him over. He did not apologize for the steak coming out raw, but did take it back to the kitchen. Another ten minutes later he returned with my meal. The steak, which was the original one served to me, was now a mangled piece of unedible meat. Tough to cut or chew, and needless to say less than enjoyable. After a bite or two, I had lost my appetitie. n nWhen he came back to our table, he asked if I was still working on my meal or if I'd like a box. I said no, and before I could even get out that the meal was not up to par and quite frankly inedible, he had walked away with the dish, again with no apology. n nSadly, we were still charged the 23 for the meal which was the most frustrating part. It's one thing to be served a horrible meal, but another to feel as though the restaurant waiter does nothing to make it right either by returning with a meal that is as ordered, or after a second attempt removing the item from the bill. or really even just a simple apology and some sensitivity to the fact that we were here for a special occassion, of which he was fully aware. n nNeedless to say, the message was received from 300 East that they do not want our business, so we will no longer return to 300 East for our special occassions.",1
"Firstly I will say that I never received any services from this place. I got a Groupon for a facial I needed to use before it expired. I went on their website to check when they were open, what kind of facial I wanted, and hoping to make an appointment for Friday. The website clearly states, ""Friday 10 16 5. WALK IN ONLY NO APPOINTMENTS TAKEN "". I left work 4 hours early to try and make it to the school before they closed. I made it, and walked in through doors that also stated they closed at 5pm. I asked the girl if they stopped taking people at 5 or they needed to be finished by 5. She stated they were closed, and closed at 4pm. When I asked about the door and the website, the girl told me they were wrong. Yes, it was my fault waiting until the last hour of the last day to use my Groupon. Did this business act unprofessional? The girl was nice, but it is very unprofessional to have conflicting information on your website and the front door of your business . Needless to say, I will not be back to use the cash value.",1
"Friendly staff, great atmosphere, and adequate food. Plus, cider and Guiness on tap!",2
"The food is ok but the service is TERRIBLE! I've ordered delivery twice from them. The first time the driver got so angry and yelled at me over the phone because he couldn't find my house. My house is in the city, in a neighborhood with a street light right in front of my house, not difficult to find. When he arrived he shoved my food at me and stomped off without a word. The second time I ordered on a Friday night, their website says they're open until 11 00 and delivery orders are accepted until 10 30. I work at a restaurant and I got home late, so I placed my order shortly after 10 00, plenty of time before their 10 30 cutoff and 11 00 closing time. The driver arrived around 10 50 and told me, VERY rudely, that if ever want them to deliver again I need to call earlier because they need to have time to clean up. They still weren't even closed yet! Why is calling almost an hour before they close still not early enough? If my restaurant turned people away an hour before we closed because we need to clean, I can't imagine we'd be open for business too much longer. If you don't want to be open until 11 00 then change your hours of operation, don't have your website tell your customers one thing and you say another.",1
"Solid high end tapas with a few standouts. I love Jamon Iberico and paired with the croqueta it is an amazing bite. We aslo enjoyed the Chicken and Rabbit paella, beet salad and Jamon Iberico sliders a must order . The paella can take a while so sit back and relax with some sangria and enjoy the food!",2
This place is fantastic! All the food was delectable and the half price bottles on Monday can't be beat.,2
Our Dr. is great but the administration fee is completely inappropriate. They charged my wife an annual 49 fee and myself a 49 fee. We are not going to pay 98 a year to be seen at this facility when they collect our co pay and bill our insurance company. We will find another provider.,1

What a disappointment!

"This is probably the most overrated buffet in Vegas. I heard good things about this place when they first opened, but when I visited a week ago for dinner, it was overcrowded with very long lines on the meat and seafood stations. I had to wait more than 15 minutes on the seafood station line! And for what?! Crab legs that were overcooked and oysters that smelled like women's makeup! The meat station was little better but it did not make up for other shortcomings.",1
"If you find yourself wandering on the 3rd floor trying to determine if you dressed appropriately swing back down to this joint. The price is decent and the food will surprise you hopefully for the better . I had the brisket burger while visiting in Vegas and it made me forget about In and Out for at least a few hours. Honestly this place gets pretty creative with their burgers which I commend them for and the fries are awesome. I didn't get a shake because the beer selection was so good. I did get a pretty decent grumbly stomach after eating here but in all fairness I had been eating all sorts of junk including fried pickles and the Swedish fish candy from NY,NY hotel. I would visit again next time I'm in Vegas.",2
"Oh yes I love the Steinmart. nHere is the deal, a lot of the clothing is what I would describe as well, older Real Estate Lady clothing. nBut do not let that stop you from taking a look around, you can get some really cool stuff in here, slacks, skirts, dresses, shoes, sweaters. My advice don't wear them all together or you will have a recipe for looking 20 years older LOL! nTheir sales are pretty darn good too! nBelts, scarves, jewelry, again not all at the same time please, unless you like that left my walker in the car look. nThe store is always clean and well organized, the sales staff is helpful and nice, the dressing rooms are a bit small, but you are trying on clothing not having lunch.",2
"Customer Beware, check your receipt before u pay. False and misleading prices on the menu. They charge more without updating their menu. Once got caught, they didnt apologize for the mistake, instead they argue with me on how they have been charging the new prices for a long time. ya, thanks for letting me know that I've been overcharged all these yrs! will never go back again!",1
"Baja is another staple in my lunch rotation. One of my favorite things about Baja is that I can be either really, really good with a healthy food selection, or I can be really, really bad. Either way, the ingredients are fresh and the food is good. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. n nI am a HUGE fan of salads, ever since Friday was salad bar day in elementary school, I have loved a good salad! However, with my salad I like good quality lettuce, with a nice color. Don't give me almost white iceberg lettuce, no big yellow piece from the bottom, and no transparent pieces that indicate the lettuce was once frozen. Give me a good spring mix, some arugula or watercress, maybe some butter lettuce or romaine with a good green color. n nBaja's salads have good, green romaine lettuce which is of top priority when making or selecting a salad. Sometimes instead of the Baja Ensalada with Chicken, I ask for Grilled Shrimp! Other favorites include the grilled shrimp or veggie tacos not on the menu, but they'll make 'em . The tortilla soup is good. Veggie Burrito or Nachos for when I'm feeling bad. And don't forget a good iced tea, my favorite work approved lunchtime beverage of choice! n nAs with anywhere around this area, lunch time is crazy! Get here before 11 45 or call in your order!",2
"Maybe my expectations were too high but Hash House A Go Go kind of disappointed me on every level. n nAfter months of lusting over the Chicken Benedict after seeing it on Food Network I could hardly wait, Too bad I had to. We got there around 11am on a Thursday and the place was pretty packed inside. The hostess was friendly and quoted the wait around 30 minutes unless we wanted to sit outside. Being hung over and starved we chose the patio and thats where the experience became unpleasant. n n Our waitress was cool but it took her 10 15 minutes to bring us our drinks and being that we hit the sheets around 5 that morning we needed that coffee and water badly. I ended up ordering the Boston Hash because at the time it sounded amazing, and my bro got the Fried Chicken Benedict so I was just gonna steal bites from him. Our friend just got some scrambled eggs and we ordered one of those giant pancakes to split. n nAfter we ordered we got to talking about the night before and kind of lost track of time before I realized our food was taking wayyy too long. I was able to estimate exactly how long from a text my bro sent as we were ordering and it was going on 36 minutes and we still hadn't seen a plate. After I caught up to the waitress she assured me the food was coming and after another 5 minutes it did. n nThe plates looked delicious! Everything was piled high, too bad the quality didn't match the quantity! My crab cakes just weren't good at all, they had a good amount of crab but just weren't that tasty, and the horseradish cream that came with it didn't help. Plus my potatoes were soggy and burnt tasting! I tasted my bros Benedict and while it was better than my breakfast it wasn't stellar, the pancake was kinda dry and seemed like it was cooked way before it was brought out. The best thing about the meal was the watermelon kiwi lemonade I ordered and to add insult to injury it took us another 20 minutes to catch a cab out of there. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.",1

"We love total wines for several reasons. n nPRICES They almost always have the best prices you can find. The only time a bottle will be cheaper is at Costco with a coupon, though there are only a few each year. n nTASTINGS Free and every Friday Sat Sunday. When they first opened they were tasting 40 50 wines, now they usually stick to 10 wines and some are ""for the inexperienced masses "" like super sweet crappy reds, but the tastings are still fun. n nSELECTION The store has a large selection, though I have seen bigger. Also, you will not find too many super great wines or boutique wines here, mostly the mass marketed stuff. I remember one trip I was looking for Bonterra wines they were in the organic section bubbly including chandon, roederer, cristalino, riondo, and a split of cliquot check check check and check. Cali viogners under 10 they had 5 different ones. Their liquor selection is also solid. I am not a beer drinker but it seems that is a huge section. n nSERVICE They are very friendly here, they even let us use a coupon that we forgot to bring in once. I don't think they are particularly knowledgeable about the specifics of wines, however.",2
"I've never been to Dim Sum in Vegas, but we tried this place based on online reviews. It's hidden in the back area of the Gold Coast casino and when we walked up to it, there was a line of about 20 people in line which was a good sign. We were a large party 12 people and it took about 30 minutes to get seated. There were lots of chinese people here which again was a good sign. Once we sat down, it was on. n nThe quality of the dim sum was pretty high. The dim sum dishes were all fresh. I would consider them to be in the upper echelon if we moved this place to the Bay Area. Would I go back? Probably. Prices were reasonable, food was good and it was authentic.",2

"Arrived on a Friday at 6PM. A few tables but not busy. We ordered a bottle of wine Ecco Domani Merlot for 28 and knew we could buy this at any market for 10 to 12. Overpriced. n nMy date ordered Lasagna 14 and I ordered the Rigatoni Al Forno 13 . I got the side salad with Parmesan dressing and he the Minestrone. Bread and olive oil dipping were very good. The salad was okay but the Minestrone soup, while tasty, had a small bay leaf in it. When we told our server about this, he said that the kitchen leaves them in and when you get one, it's a symbol of good fortune. What ? This is a serious choking hazard and nothing should be in your soup that you can't eat ! How absurd ! n nThe rigatoni was a ""huge "" bowl but the lasagna, although tasty, was very small and lukewarm at best. The rigatoni was VERY hot as it was placed in the fire burning oven and was 3 times the size of the lasagna for less money. n nWe were then given the dessert menu and didn't see our server for 15 minutes. While we finished our wine, we put our jackets on and the server came over. Asked if he could bring us anything else and we said just the check.

Let me start off by saying that my experience here was so bad that I took the time to make an account and write this review. I use yelp all the time but never needed to actually make an account. The nail service and customer service was far by the WORST i have ever experienced. I got my nails done 2 days ago and all my nails were chipped and cracked on both hands. I also got my eyebrows done which was extremely painful. I went back today to get them fixed and not once did they apologize for the inconvenience but rather blamed me for not getting the service that was 30 dollars more than i paid. The entire hour she was fixing my nails she was talking in Vietnamese to the other workers creating a very uncomfortable situation with all the workers looking back at me. n nNever would go back again. I would urge anyone that considers to go here to drive and extra 5 10 mins to a different salon. In the 6 years I've lived here I have never experienced such bad service and uncomfort while getting my nails which is supposed to be relaxing and pleasurable experience.,1

Both very light dishes my friend and I split both and did not leave you feeling hungry. Do avoid the chai tea. n nI will definitely return here on my next trip to Montreal.",2
"I was surprised to see a lot of people from the coasts raving about it. I would have expected people who are not from fly over states to be disappointed as i was. n n1.If you think this is a high end upscale restaurant don't come here. The atmosphere is of a mediocre sushi bar, even the bathrooms are not very clean. The staff is ok, but for what you are paying i'll get to it you deserve a lot more. It is noisy, small and not in the good way and basically every shmuck who walks in the MGM grand should have been the first warning sign to me can see you eat. n n2.If you know and value your food don't come here. I value good food whether it is in a hole in a wall or a 3 star michelin restaurant.The food here is major meh. Sure the langoustines here are from the atlantic and they are not bad, but 60 for 3 of them? give me a break. I had to return their ""signature "" dish the quail stuffed with foie gras. It was bland and very meh. Meh is how I would describe this place. nNow usually it's hard to get it wrong with the desserts. I understand why people would wow over the framboise that melts into itself, but we had 3 desserts and there is a chance the Cinnabon across the hall is a better use for your money n n3. If you value your money don't come here. nThe prices are ridiculous 60 and 70 for main dishes and 50 60 for starters , 15 for a dessert. And what do you get ? Sure seeing the staff at work is nice but. the atmosphere is like a noisy street sushi bar. For 130 per person before drinks and all, i can go to daniel in nyc 3 stars, not one , sit like a king and have the entire french experience. nThe food? not amazing, especially not worth the ridiculous prices you pay for it. n nThe service? nice, but not worth the price nice. n nIf you value food, money or atmosphere don't come here all the rednecks around you that take the tasting menu wine pairing that is 260 a pop will just make you go WTF.",1
"This place does not impress. but I wish that it did! Sometimes all I want is a salad, but not a 15 one that I have to put together myself. The meat looks. weird. It's always empty.

I would probably not book with Rio ever again. Although they have a lot of slots and decent restaurants the room was outdated and we got charged an additional 20 per person which is a resort fee.

"I love self serve frozen yogurt places. I actually came here once during the winter. There various kinds of frozen yogurt flavors. I only like chocolate and that's what I always get. There are different fruit and candy toppings. Ive had a little bit of everything. The toppings were fresh and didn't taste stale. The spoons are reusable I keep mine in my purse. Why throw away a perfectly good spoon? It's been hot these days, so it would be a real treat to come in here for some frozen yogurt.",2
"Foods pretty good although portions are small , coffee's good and you get pretty much unlimited refills if you drink it there, but tea selection is terrible and poor quality . A pretty good place for lunch and studying, though. It's never gotten too loud during lunchtime or right after lunch, but sometimes they shut off the free wifi from 11 30am 1 30pm to deter people with laptops from hanging around during that time. n nLarge booths and tables tend to be a pretty good size, big enough for a couple people to study at. Unfortunately, they close pretty early during the week and on the weekends, forcing people to pack up and go somewhere else. Overall, not bad for food and studying, but not great for those who are looking for somewhere to study at night.",2
"Unfortunately, I went in this past December and encountered cockroaches at my table. I screamed because they're creepy and took pictures. The manager came over with our bill and talked to us, chalking it up to the location saying, ""it's Vegas "".

You'd think they'd want to bribe us into not telling anyone and we will never return. n nI apologize for taking so long to write the review, I just felt bad thinking about what could happen to their business, but I recently told a friend about the experience who convinced me I should.",1
Very disappointed and couldn't sleep. This is the place to stay if you want to hear a loud party outside your room. There is a bar very close that plays live music thurs sat until 2am. it practically makes the building shake. I complained and there wasnt anything they could do. I at least wanted ear plugs! I would book a hotel further from that bar in the area avoid this one! Plus there was hair in the shower when we got here. Gross!,1
"Mardi Gras made the switch from comedy club to full fledged live music venue last year and has attracted a new crowd with its revamped atmosphere. The dive rock 'n' roll bar, which features a jukebox and attached restaurant the Voodoo Lounge is a great place to see live music. The sound system is awesome. n nThe club is lacking a big following however since they tend to book anyone with a guitar. Some of the bigger shows included national alt country act Shurman, Scotty Johnson of the Gin Blossoms and Steve Larson of Roger Clyne The Peacemakers. Sadly there's more bands you probably haven't heard of that play here than well established acts like the above mentioned with a following. Hopefully Mardi Gras will get a clue soon and start booking some better talent.",1
"This business greatly pertains to those in search of a great Italian take out. n nTheir food. Speaking from experience, they put together a mean specialty pie called ""Caprese "" which features a fresh mozzarella based pie, fresh tomatoes, roasted red peppers, a good amount of garlic, basil, and EVOO. This is extremely delicious, and I recommend a trial. Their pasta entrees are also very good. A favorite of ours is the ""Penne Rosario "", which is served over a pesto cream sauce. n nThe venue itself is better suited for more of a quick eat, with bench like seating arrangements. Not much d u00e9cor. Dine in is better suited for a lunchtime demographic. The overall location is generally decent but I feel like their business would fair much better in a larger commercial facility with a true ""dine in "". n nLastly, the owners are Italian. Always a plus when running an Italian business. n nFor more info on this business, and or access their menu online see http www.dueamicipizza.com .",2

"I went to lunch with my buddy, Rob M., to a place called Uncle Bear's Bar and Grill. It was actually pretty cool! I was surprised because it is in one of the more LAME areas near my house. Namely ""Warner and Cooper "". n nWhen we entered however, it was anything BUT lame. Dog bowls on all the tables filled with mutant peanuts. Granted, it was lunch, but there really wasn't more than 3 other groups there. This led me to believe the food service was bad. Not at all!

"I used to like this place, but it kind of lost its zest. Popped in and immediately the bartender greeted me, but it was a weird greeting along the lines of, ""why are you here? "".

Very nice place. Got the seeweed wrap with a facial. My aesthetician was very informative. Place was huge. Go a few hours before your actual appointment so you can enjoy the other amenities that are included when you book a treatment. Nice relaxing place after a night out.,2

I got the combo pho.didn't finish it as usual. nThe broth is really good and it's got all the little oil circles happily floating around, this stuff is the real deal. nI'm gonna echo a few of the previous reviews and say that the temperature of the broth wasn't as hot as it should have been, but that's really my only complaint. n nGiven the option of pho so 1 or kim long I would probably head here first, just for the quality of the pho. Translation if you are a tourist pay your taxi man for the extra half mile n nAmbiance is a whole other story, but who the hell is gonna take a date to pho anyway?",2
"So disappointed! With all the great pictures and reviews we thought this was going to be fantastic! We paid 70 per person included a generous tip and were so disappointed. n nQuality of sushi sucked. Paper thin pieces of fish on nigiri and just California rolls as the other options. Pictures we saw were of king crab legs, we got skinny snow crab legs. Other stations we just ok. Nothing spectacular to justify why we pay so much! n nStaff at the serving stations were so rude. I don't know if they were so busy, but they definitely didn't want to be there. n nOnly thing I could say was the ramen was good. Fresh cooked noodles in great broth. Thanks for the 70 ramen!",1
" This is a downstairs Wine Bar review only n nThe other night my wife and I had an excellent time at the bottom floor bar of Aureole in Mandalay Bay. There is also an upstairs cocktail area along the hallway inside Mandalay Bay, but we felt more like a bar experience than a people watching one. n nThe wine selection was EXCELLENT. I got a red flight and my wife got a white flight. The tempranillo and zinfindel in the red flight were great, and my wife said two out of her three white wines were excellent. n nWe also got an ahi tuna appetizer which gets an A for presentation and taste, but a B for quantity. They aren't huge or anything, and they come on a specialized plate designated for six pieces but instead give you four with the other two pieces on the plate garnished with avacado. n nWe also go the dessert sampler menu which I highly suggest for sugar lovers out there. Everything from the Creme Brule to the Lava Cake was outstanding, and just enough for two people to share. We were going to pair the dessert with a Sautern, but the Sautern there wasn't very good, so we opted on recommendation from the bartender for an Ice Wine instead. The Ice Wine was AMAZING. n nThe service was also remarkable. It was pretty busy downstairs but the two men tending the bar were still personable and didn't rush us. We did get their fairly early in the night about 6 30pm on a Friday , so the rush may not have come yet. n nAlso, another cool feature was the Cirque du Soleil esque wine retriever. They have a four story wine rack that is great to look at and it becomes even more fun when you see a woman in a harness bouncing up and down to get the bottle you want. n nAll in all, this place would have been perfect if it wasn't for one thing The prices. We got two sample flights of wine, an ahi tuna appetizer, a dessert sampler and two glasses of Ice Wine and the price came out to about 115 before the tip. I get that sometimes you are paying for experience, but I know I didn't get 115 in quality of wine. n nEverything else was magnificent. I was very impressed and may go back to Aureole again, but I may only get one or two items to keep down on the cost. n nExtra Note While your there, and if you go before 9pm, walk down to the Shark Reef. It was a great experience and they do have discounts for locals. I thought it was going to be a small, crappy aquarium but it was actually pretty good sized and kept us entertained for awhile.",2
"I have never stayed at Stratosphere, but based on the mixed reviews on here I decided to find out for myself. The hotel overall is a DECENT place to stay considering the remarkable very CHEAP price we paid for the whole weekend. n n FYI If you're all fancy and stuff and are expecting MORE.this is NOT the place for you.BUT, if you're a baller on a budget.you might like this place. n nSince my fianc u00e9 and I stayed at the newly remodeled rooms, the self parking garage is easily located near the exit which was very convenient. Like everyone said, the surrounding area is very HOOD.Don't walk around outside when it's dark! I like the fact that it was far from the strip and navigating around town made it easy to take the back streets. n nChecking in out was easy there's no lines. The employees at Stratosphere were very helpful and courteous. Regarding the remodeled rooms the king size bed was okay it could be better by making it softer. We definitely found the bathroom to be spacious, and the jacuzzi tub was awesome! n nGambling was fun, not so crowded which I definitely liked. We were able to go to the top of the tower and we got to see the magnificent view. Overall, it was a wonderful place to stay Seriously, it's not that BAD and I would definitely come back again.",2
Sat down for a very nice meal here. Large portions accompany a large check. n nThe Mac and cheese with truffles is to die for and at 6 9 it doesn't get much better! n nThe wait staff was very friendly.,2
"This Italian restaurant is in a very serene resort with great service and outstanding decor. My dinner couldn't match the hype. My server was very difficult to understand though he kept saying he was there to help me. After some deliberation, I chose the Burata and Tagliatelle. I wanted more Burata than tomatoes. It was overwhelming amounts. Same for the pasta. I think the ratio was 3 to 1 sauce to pasta. I sent most of the tomatoes and the sauce for the pasta back with no concern from my server. He was quick to drop the dessert menu, though. I was very disappointed. I would not attempt to return with those prices.",1
"So I've been here twice within 3 days and not because I wanted to. I'm not a fan of buffets for my lack of self control. LOL Monday I brought my daughter and her friend for lunch. Immediately you are greeted by all the employees ""Welcome to Cici's! "". Pretty nice little greeting I must say. The girl at the cashier asked ""how many "" and I said 3. As I started to ask about the child rate she handed me a receipt that said 3 adults. I simply asked her what was the age for the child rate. She in turn asked me how old the girls were. I replied that both of them are 11 and in passing asked ""oh is the age 10 and under "" and she replied back ""no its 11 and under "". She proceeded to look past me to help the next customer and I shook my head and decided to just dismiss that whole convo. Challenging stupidity doesn't make for a good lunch with my girls. n nWe quickly found our seats and the girls were up and at em. We each grabbed a tray. A couple of the dishes I picked up were dirty so I just set them to the side. The pasta is one of my favorite simple things however when I got up there the pasta needed refilled. I asked the girl behind the counter if they knew their pasta needed refilled. She replied ""yes "" and continued with her pizzas not even headed to the pasta to see what I was referring to. Instead she addressed some ""regular "" customers behind me hence the immediate dismissal of the question. Kinda awkward to say the least. Finally 10 minutes later it was refilled. Sigh. n nThey serve pasta salad, salad, soup, corkscrew pasta with red and white sauce, breadsticks garlic knots, a plethora of pizza and a few dessert options. Their food is what it is.a really cheap family buffet. With that said the pizzas leave a lot to be desired, don't have much cheese or meat, have a lot of dough but is all good for the carb evore in you! This place really should be named CiCi's CARB Buffet! Its a bread lovers dream! You seriously need to put in some cardio time after eating here. n nThe place is pretty beat up. The walls, floors and tables are scuffed up and chipped. Its definitely a place to bring all the children and your neighbors children. You can tell they all have been here! LOL There are TVs mounted up high that had children shows on them. You cant hear the sound so I'm always not sure why restaurants even bother. There is a small arcade in the back that the kids love. There's a community board that has a few things posted but looks all greasy from little hands touching it. Another dirty detail. n nNow while the girls were spending their couple dollars on the arcade I was checking in on my handy dandy YELP app on my phone. While I sit there and observe the chaos around me, my eyes found there way up the wall in slow motion. Eeek! The Health Department grade! Like an elephant in the room how did I miss it when it was right in front of me the whole time I was eating! I can say I'm not surprised however at the same time I'm not even sure if I had ever seen a C Grade in person. Hm. That's right Graded a C! Thank goodness it was after we ate because that is a sure turn off to me regardless of the details. I do watch Restaurant Impossible! LOL n nOn a side note, at the end of our meal the manager came over to ask if everything was to our satisfaction. I decided not to bother to inform him of the awkward and lazy service from his employees. I think the place is run with super young people with lack of guidance possibly. He was just a baby himself or I'm just old. I beg to differ. LOL n nNeedless to say, I will not be back anytime soon. This is only a ""when I have to "" place to eat category of Chuck E Cheese. LOL. I will for sure be checking the grade next time though with curiosity of an upgrade! ",1
"Don't go, between the cost of the tickets and paying for parking. It's more like walking through a movie set. Not scary at all. Save your money!",1
"I was skeptical before coming here today but I was extremely presently surprised! My party ordered a few items and shared the hummus appetizer, greek pizza, bison burger with jicama fries, a veggie wrap and apple pie smoothie. We were very happy and satisfied! The service was fast, attentive, the quality was great and the food was cooked just as specified. I'll be coming back soon!",2
"The smell hits you when you walk in the door. It is a mixture of teen spirit, grimey carpet, stale pizza, mildew and god knows what else. But the fun doesnt stop there! Eight bucks on a Friday gets a six yr old all she can skate but no beer for the parents?!?! OK maybe this is signaling a problem I may have instead of a problem the rink has but I am sure I am not the only one that would like to have known prior! n nThere is nothing wrong with the actual rink per se of course, it is utterly skatable and has a wall on one side for those that need a little help balancing. You get used to the smell after a while and you can sneak beer or wine in in an unassuming McDonalds cup BUT my major problem with this place is the 'arcade' believe it or not! At least half of the games were Out of Order and only half of those had signs on them indicating they were broken so you didnt find out until you had put your money in and started swearing at the machine. n nIn addition to that the token machine is broken putting in a dollar should get you four tokens but the first time it got us two, the next got us four, a five dollar bill got us ten tokens. Ummmm no. This is straight robbery so the boyfriend went right to the cashier and asked politely for all of our money back which was returned without issue. n nMost parents figured out the right thing to do at this place since there is no beer and no games to play is to just drop their kids off and come and get them later. Well you cant do this with a six yr old. So we were just drinking out of our cup and people watching the time does go surprisingly fast because there is a never ending parade of great people watching. There were two good parts about the rink 1 the DJ was good and funny playing the latest hits as well as running funny games 2 our happy little six yr old's face.sigh.so even tho this place literally stinks, we will probably be back.",1
"Came in 20 min. before the store was closing after a 8 hour drive from SD, I wasn't sure if they'd serve us, I asked if we could just order something to go. The host was very welcoming insisted that they were still open able to serve us dining in. I was relieved as it had been a long day in the car it was raining out. We sat down, our order was taken, the food came fast piping hot. Our server was so sweet, in fact even the staff that wasn't serving us, greeted us everyone was just so friendly. maybe it was because it was almost time to go home. lol but regardless, everyone made it a very nice experience for 2 weary travelers.",2
"What a train wreck! I stopped in there for lunch at 11 15, the place was close to empty and the waiter took my order within a couple of minutes this was the peak of the good service, or more accurately the anomaly of the terrible service. n nThe restaurant began to fill up and at 11 47 my chicken pita was no where to be found, after going to the counter and requesting my order to go, I only had to wait an additional 10 minutes too bad because the food was actually really good. n nI just don't have that much to time to invest in a quick lunch.",1
i just stopped by zizi's on friday to check it out. i got the avocado hummus wrap. it was quite delish! my strawberry smoothie was very tasty but wasn't very cold. which means they don't water down their smoothies! i will definitely visit again. i recommend you call your order in and then pick it up.,2
Elmer's is very greasy and very good. I just wish they had carnitas and that they stayed open a bit later.,2
"I've been to Sakana's a number of times but since I found Sushi Ken about a year ago, there's usually no other place I go to for Sushi besides Sushi Ken. However, if Sushi Ken happens close for any reason, my next choice is Sakana's. They offer some good tasting sashimi. The ambiance is quite nice here as well. If you want to take a date out or want to go out for some drinks with a group of friends, this place will provide you with a nice hip atmosphere but not like Ra where every hipster and pretentious people like to hang out because they think sushi is trendy and cool.",2
"The first time I went to Sauce, I had a sandwich, and I really liked it. I also really liked the retro decor of the place. It was different and seemed non chain like whatever that means . The second time I went to Sauce, I had their pepperoni pizza, and it was, eh, okay. Nothing special.at.all. It was greasy and there was too much cheese for the thin crust to hold up so the slices were kinda limp when you picked them up. I've had better pizza from places like Ray's Pizza and Sardellas for a much more reasonable price. n nThe biggest problem I had with this second visit was that a few minutes after we sat down, they brought out my Mom's sandwich, but didn't bring out the pizza until probably 15 or 20 minutes later. H E L L O?! My Mom was already halfway done with her sandwich. We ordered them all together, so why didn't they bring the entire order out at the same time? That is a very bad way to serve food. But, I do have to give them a little props because the manager came out with the pizza and apologized for it taking so long. n nI think Sauce is pretty much overrated. The decor and look of the restaurant is kinda cool, but they need to work on their pizzas. I'll probably go back, but only for their sandwiches from now on.",1
"The gyros are good, best French fries ever. A slice of pizza took a long time. I like how small it is. Family run. Go here while waiting for your mienke oil change.",2
"I had the prosciutto pizza, my fiance had the calzone. Both were very good! The sauce tastes fresher and you can tell it's more authentic. Our food was hot and the gelato was delicious. If you want better service, it's probably better to sit inside, however. The waiter took our order and gave us our drinks and didn't return until after we finished eating. It would have been nice to have a refill before the check came but the food was still delicious!",2
"I bought a used bookcase that needed two glass shelves replaced. I went to Bell Glass because they had two 5 star reviews and they were nearby. The shelves were perfect, ready the next day, and very reasonably priced. I will be back to Bell Glass for any future glass needs.",2
"There's nothing so spectacular here that warrants a really great review. The food was mediocre definitely not what I expected from such a new, and excitingly modern hotel. Crab legs were cold, and nothing really jumped out and screamed ""FRESH! "" To me. However, they do have moscato d'asti on the ""all you can drink "" additional option for 12 so I was able to get my money's worth out of that. I'm disappointed I paid full price for the dinner buffet. Rookie mistake. I wouldn't return.",1
Awesome coffee shop at the Biltmore. This is owned by the same people who run Royal at the Phx public Market downtown. Modern vibe and right next to shopping. The iced Chai and the Iced hazelnut coffees are great!,2
"The two star rating is specific to the hotel itself. We'd like to call out that the spa should be considered on it's own merit and would receive a 5 out of 5. Specifically Kelsey in the Salon section does a great haircut. n nOverall assessment Vdara is the shell of a great hotel. The design is outstanding the touches of art and contemporary style are exactly what a great hotel on the strip should look like, but aside from that all the ""little things "" about it that make a great experience were lacking. n nLet's start at the very beginning. when checking in the front desk employee named Francis said that he was upgrading our room yay! and informed us that the pool was closed, but we could use Aria's pool instead. As it turned out, he gave us the exact room we booked, misinformed us about the pool it was open and we were later told that there was no affiliation with Aria , and yet, our breakfast that came with the booking was to be redeemed at the Aria what? n nThe room itself seemed smaller than described because a huge amount of sq footage was dedicated to a seemingly useless kitchen. There is a kitchen, but no coffee maker. Oh yeah, and then they charge you out the ass for a basic cup of coffee downstairs in the cafe more than Starbucks! And to top it off, at one point, room service came up to drop off a box of Keurig k cups and when we pointed out we had no coffee maker they basically ran out of the room. The room was a king bed with a pull out couch. The pull out couch was like sleeping on the coils and metal bars holding it together. When we asked the front desk if there was another room with a better mattress we were staying for four days and wanted to be comfortable, not too much to ask in my opinion they said we have nothing, but we can put 5 or 6 mattress pads on it and it will be okay. OK is at best how I would describe it. From a brand new hotel we expected some quality in the mattresses supplied in the bedrooms. When the remote control stopped working in our room the front desk representative told me to pop out the back and make sure the batteries were in correctly then hung up. n nOur biggest issue with VDARA was that every single person who worked there seemed miserable to be there. They were not there to make the experience comfortable nor pleasurable and hospitality was not on their minds. Housekeeping was rude, the front desk was misinformed and snippy and the concierge did not want to be there. We had good experiences with the man who delivered the linens for the pull out couch, the pool attendants and room service. Icing on the cake if you wanted to stay at this god forsaken place for a late checkout they were going to charge you for it, whether you're flight was delayed or not oh and there is a 25 per day resort fee that is charged at checkout though there is no restaurant or resort to speak of. nAside from the Spa and hotel design Vdara promises a luxury experience and does not come remotely close to delivering. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.",1
"Big fans of local brews and breweries. Was excited to try this place out when we found it. The beer list on the wall SOUNDS amazing and we couldn't decide which to go with so we ordered a flight. If we liked what we had, we would order another flight and sample as many as we could. nThat opportunity did not afford itself. We could not even finish some of the beers in the flight. I have to agree with another reviewer that several of the beers had too strong of an alcohol burn. The brewery itself had a ""beer gone bad "" smell to it. 1 star for the outdoor patio. nWe had nPomegranate Wheat was okay, not a huge pomegranate flavor, was finishable but not rememberable. nBlack Cherry Blonde the best one we had. It tasted like juice. We chased some of the other ones with it. nImperial Adler IPA initial hops aroma and flavor were extremely satisfying and then. wtf happened? It turned to alcohol on the back of my tongue. Couldn't finish this one, but tried. nBlack Talon RIS this one didn't even work in the beginning. Sneered our noses at it and poked it with a stick a little. Went down the drain mostly undrank. nRoman Eagle Pale Ale second favorite of the bunch, nothing offensive, which by the time we got around to this one we were so happy so have something drinkable it probably boosted our opinion of it. nSave your dollars and taste buds for something better, imo.",1
"Thank you soooo much for taking care of my furbaby, Pumpkin. The owners are very caring love animals. You can totally tell by the way my baby was acting at the end of her stay. I had to go out of town for surgery missed my pick up time because I missed my plane ride home. The next day the owners called, on their day off because I was going to pick my baby up but I had gotten sick from stress pain. I called a day later one of the owners sorry really bad with names came in just so I could pick Pumpkin up. She suggested that I change her food to blue buffalo instead of the cheaper grocery brand that I thought was good for her. I am glad I took her suggestion because Pummy's breath no longer smells bad. They also bathed her before I picked her up. nThey are economical very nice. I will definitely use them again!",2
"Towering over the strip at the top of Mandalay Bay awaits a stunning view, and not much else. Alain Ducasse's Mix, offers little more than a brilliant view, and a unique decor. Think, eating inside a champagne bottle in a Swedish furniture store. n nBefore getting to your table, you will walk through MIx's club lounge. This awkward identity crisis of an area is enough to throw off what could be a very relaxing and luxurious ambience. n nThe food was good, not great. Especially disappointing was the Candy Bar on the dessert menu. The Cucumber sorbet was light, breezy and refreshing, and certainly the highlight of the meal. n nEven after the delicious sorbet, I left Mix with a bitter taste in my mouth. n nStop up for a cocktail and take in the view. It is far more satisfying than the food.",1
The employees were very nice and paid good attention to our table. I do have to say that i didnt like the food. I eat sushi at least twice a week and have an idea of what its supposed to taste look like. n nI ordered the tuna nachos and I didn't like them.,1
"This is the bar in the middle of the TI. It's a good place to people watch and it's right by the table games so a good spot for people to hang out who don't really gamble. n nFor being a bar in the middle of the TI, the prices weren't too bad. I know you probably think I'm rich for saying 6.50 for a draft beer is reasonable, but try to get that price at any of the other major hotels on the strip. n nThe service here is sort of slow, but no one is really in any big hurry when hanging out here so mind as well kick back and relax.",2
"Don't waste time going! The food was cold. The waiter never went to the table, all the time we call them to refill the beverage and I never received the check had to get up and get it my self. Bad service!",1
"Everything leading up to the massage is a little unorganized. There is no receptionist so it is difficult to make the appointment. You have to wait to be picked up in the hotel lobby. There is no spa associated with this massage room, but the room is very nicely decorated. Poor DJ runs the entire operation by himself and seems rushed and frazzled when you meet him. But as soon as he puts his hands on you all of that frustration and judgment melts away. He gives the best massage I have ever had. I was a massage therapist for 12 years and I now regularly get massages a couple of times a month. I have been bouncing around Las Vegas for the past year never repeating with the same therapist twice. nFinally I don't have to try anyone else. He was very talented and super nice. He really cares about his work and puts so much energy into his work.",2
Went to Tias for lunch. Not extremely busy. Had to flag down a waiter to get service. Wasn't offered the lunch menu either. Ordered our food and mentioned that we needed to place a to go order too. Server told us to remind him to place the order. Isn't that what a server is for? Reminded him after we got our food and when he checked on us. Got our tab and no to go food on tab. Paid bill and then he asked about to go order. Told him not to worry about it. He didn't apologize and acted like it was no big deal. Won't be back for a while.,1
"I've shopped at Target Stores all across the country, from New York to Seattle, and will have to say that this one is by far the worst. Nonetheless, they seem to do a lot of business, there's a backup at Checkout whenever I go, so you have to wonder how much better this location would do if they offered the value and customer service of other Targets. Last month, they held an employee meeting in the middle of the day in the middle of the store, the Bedding department. If you can imagine aisles completely empty of staff except in Bedding where a crowd of more than 15 are standing and those 15 employees jumping up and down exclaiming how great they were, then you get the picture. A customer walked up to the edge of the 15 crowd of employees and pleaded for help, saying he was late and need to find an item quickly. They paused long enough to laugh at him, then turned around and kept jumping up and down telling each other how great they were. If it wasn't so sad, it would have been hilarious! That is somewhat comparable to my experience, which just happened, where I was directed to Checkout 10 with the instructions ""No one is at that register. "", meaning, no customers were there, so no waits. I was thinking ""Wow, that staffer was very helpful. "" until getting to Checkout 10 and finding that the cashier had a stack of coupons she was going through, many of which would not scan. After waiting a very long time, I jumped into a different line and finally made it to the front. I handed the cashier a 20 off everything coupon which she set to one side and then rang everything up. Before she finished, I pointed to the coupon again and reminded her to knock 20 off the final bill. She didn't. She did apologize, though, saying it was not possible to void the sale and then give me 20 off, so since it was her mistake, she kindly walked me over to Customer Service where we gave an attendant the receipt and the coupon and told her we'd be back in a moment with the goods. All was set. Things were good. My opinion of this Target was changing. I got back to Customer Service in less than a couple of minutes and in that time a line had formed. The ""Customer Service "" rep who was assigned the task of refunding me 20 told me to go to the end of the line. I told her that wasn't our agreement. She said ""Go to the end of the line. "" I said ""Give me back the receipt as well as the 20 off coupon. "" After she did that, I said politely, thoughtfully, and kindly to her just to make sure she knew she had done something bad ""This is very disappointing. "" The clerk next to her mouthed the words ""F YOU! "". Wow! Finally, after what seemed like about 20 minutes after arriving at Checkout to pay for a few items, I was leaving with no 20 off and lots of misdirection and an insult I will never forget. But, that wasn't my worst experience at this store. You almost have to go there to see it for yourself!",1
"I have been here once for lunch and sat outside only to get eaten alive by flies, nothing worse than eating outside on a nice patio and being pestered the entire time. n nI decided to give it another chance for happy hour, well guess what? flies followed me inside too. n nI don't know if it was the time of year early spring or what, but they really need an exterminator!",1
CANDY CANDY CANDY. n nWhen you walk in it is fash back into the willy wonka factory.

"Unlimited fries. n nIs there really anything to be said after this? n nOK, they are the thick cut steak fries.

Always hot, fresh, and well seasoned. n nI prefer to grab and go here, as it can get over run with kids, which, if you're not with your own, can be a PITA. n nI do agree with the other reviewers that being served a meal in a plastic red basket is a turn off. Can they swing a plate? You have to wash the baskets anyhow DON'T YOU? .",2

"On a recent trip to Vegas, we got roped into the timeshare scam by Grandview Resorts. n nWe were approached on the strip by a blonde lady named Robin and offered two pairs of free show tickets plus a free buffet breakfast if we could suffer through an hour presentation after. We were told the hotel we'd be touring was just down the strip from where we were staying at Excalibur so we figured, knowing it would be sales pitch that we wouldn't take, two hours of our time was worth two free pairs of tickets. I really wanted to see a show while on vacation. n nUm no. All lies. n nWe boarded a charter bus from our hotel on the strip with a bunch of other suckers around 10 am. We drove for 30 minutes on the freeway. Got off the bus and were ushered into the lobby of some hotel in the middle of nowhere. Upon arrival, there was no food as promised. The saleswoman on the strip had insisted that we don't eat before we go so we were totally hangry at this point and annoyed that the hotel was so much further than we were told. n nWe waited in the lobby until 11 am. Some salesman retrieves us and has us get in another car to travel to yet another property 10 minutes away where we were told the food would be. We're about an hour in at this point. n nIn the car, we told the salesman that we were told the hotel would be on the strip. ""This is the strip, "" he replied. ""Technically, we're on Las Vegas Blvd still and this will all be connected by 2020. "" Seriously, dude? n nThat's when we asked to be taken back to the hotel and given our money back. We wasted 2 hours of our day. Got no free show tickets, no food and had to argue to get our money back. n nDon't fall for the scam! The 2 3 hours does not include travel time. It's more like 4 5. The hotel is not down the strip at all. They'll tell you anything to get you there. It's quite far from the strip and in the middle of nowhere. n nThere are plenty of ways to find discounts in Vegas on shows and other fun. You don't need to attend this scam for free tickets. Totally not worth it. n nPS The salesman said we could complain, but warned us that this was such a successful pitch that the company would not care about two people complaining. Comforting. n nShame on you, Grandview!",1
Great store. Went in looking for a good pair of basketball shoes. Customer service was great. Everyone wanted to help me. Had a nice girl get me the shoes I needed and was extremely helpful with her opinions. Had a great experience here.,2
"Great place to get a quick bite to eat when you are in the Cosmopolitan. n nService is adequate. first time we ate here, it was a tad slow, but the food was delivered quickly. the second time, the waiter was really good. n nThe burgers are awesome. I had the Gold Standard both times. Highly recommend. I wanted to try something else the second time, but couldn't get over how good it was the first time. Didn't try a shake, but that's for next time.",2

"I stayed here for one night after Pricelining a room for 80. Seemed like a smoking deal, but after taxes and fees from Piceline it came to 94. Then the hotel tacks on a resort fee of course. All of this is to be expected, just a friendly 'buyer beware.' n nPros n Located close to Aria and Cosmo shows, food, gambling, etc. n Great rooms with kitchenettes think of Vdara as the Residence Inn of City Center n Well decorated n nCons n Not the best value in the star range if you don't need the kitchenette. I'd reccommend 'THE HOTEL' or one of the Towers Planet Holleywood Towers, Hard Rock Towers, etc. n See below. n nWhen I checked in I was given a handicap room without being told it was one which I didn't appreciate . My room featured a huge stain in the middle of the carpet and a shower door that allowed water to leak out even when shut completely. I reported the shower issue, they sent engineering up, but the problem remained. n nSo when checking out I very calmly really showed the manager a video of the water streaming out under the shower door and expressed my interest in making sure no one else had to deal with this. She was mildly apologetic and offered to waive the daily resort fee. I negotiated a 50 credit at the cafe and called it a day. n nSo in my opinion, not the best customer service at least for escalations or issues . I am pretty easy and travel a lot. So every once and awhile I get to deal with issues. The manager on duty got a C in my book. I was so polite, friendly, fact based, etc. and got offered a free resort credit. Kind of disappointed!",2
Rude! Walked in an walked around for 10 minutes aimlessly and no one asked me if I needed help. Way to go MAC! This was one of my worst experiences at a MAC store ever. Just because I am not thin or blonde means you can ignore me.,1
"Boo for you Budget! n nI rented a vehicle via Priceline for the Thanksgiving holiday. Priceline guarantees the price which effectively means that Budget agreed to the price as a grand total. n nWell Budget had decided to rent all of the vehicles I had agreed to rent and instead of offering me a nicer vehicle at the same price they told me that I was going to have to pay 2 more per day. Now I know what you are saying ""Evey, 2 a day more is not a big deal "" and if price were the heart of the matter I would agree with you completely however, the real issue is that they knew I was coming, they had an agreement in place, they got rid of my car, forced me to rent a more expensive car, and it wasn't even an upgrade. n nI was supposed to have a 2010 Chevy Aveo or similar car I received the 2011 Chevy Aveo. That's not an upgrade. n nI had also used an upgrade code that my insurance company provided to me that Budget was supposed to honor. The upgrade was from the economy car to the economy plus or whatever it's called. n nWhen I pointed out the issue and the verbiage on the contract I had printed out the manager dismissed everything I said. n nFrankly if I hadn't paid in advance for the car on Priceline I would have walked away and rented from another company. n nThe one and only good thing about Budget at the airport the shuttle service is fantastic as were the two drivers I had interactions with.",1
I did not enjoy the lunch buffet. There wasn't as much variety as I've seen at other Las Vegas buffets and the quality was poor.,1
"RA is OK. I like Happy hour mainly for the cheap food and Saki beer. The sushi on the other hand is just meh! It's good but its not what I consider real sushi or quality sushi. It's Arizona Sushi! Coming from LA and San Diego, this would be pathetic sushi! But some it is OK and I can tolerate it at HH due to the prices. I would not go here during regular hours and regular prices.",1
"We went in to get small tattoos on our hands and they said they wouldn't do it because of ""moral standards. "" Not sure what that means, but they told us if we had sleeves or are very inked up they'd do it but since we weren't covered, they wouldn't. The guy said what if in 10 years we try to get a job and can't because of the hand tattoos? Umm that makes no sense. What does that have to do with them? They were very rude and short, and it literally made no sense what they were saying. No thanks!",1
"This bead store is definately worth going to. They have very good sales that seem to be happening all the time or at least around the holidays when I am in Phx , I always walk away with more than I intended. The quality of the beads isn't always what I am looking for, and I like to find very unique things which in this store you really have to search for. Overall, you can find all your basics and then some at a pretty good deal.",2
holy crap guys! update your website. you have posted memos and events dating early 2013. 2015 is around the corner. I even sent multiple emails to the director of the facility. Been over a month and haven't even received a courtesy email.,1
"Came in tonight around 7 30 with three kids and two adults and we were promptly seated. The waitress was initially prompt and took our order. The ordering process went smoothly with one exception in which the waitress stopped mid order to verify the price on a side order of biscuits. It seemed strange but she recovered quickly. The first salad came out very quickly and I thought ""Wow great decision for a Hungry group with kids. "" The food came out shortly thereafter and I was very satisfied with the fish fry. Normally I would rate the food a solid 3 stars and perhaps bump up the rating to 4 stars with great service, but unfortunately after our food came out, our waitress literally disappeared. We had to practically beg to get our drinks refilled and we went for long periods of time before she checked on us. The restaurant was not overly busy. I requested that the waitress bring a box out for the food which is normally a sign of ""hey we are ready to leave "" but it was at least 15 minutes before we saw her again to request the check after bringing us the box. It was really frustrating and because of the experience, I'm not sure I want to go back. The food is good overall, but I can get equally good food and much better service somewhere else.",1
"Restaurant Santa Lucia has a lot going for it great location, capable waitstaff, an enticing menu, and a seemingly skilled chef. This restaurant could really be great if they could improve on the quality of their ingredients. n nWe started out with an appetizer of escargot, which my wife usually insists on. The sauce was delicious, but the snails were obviously not fresh and that really killed the dish. n nFor entrees, I had a calzone while my wife opted for a veggie pizza. The presentation was great, and the homemade wood fire cooked pizza dough was fantastic. Once we hit the toppings though, the honeymoon was over. The onions in my calzone were raw and totally overpowering. My wife said most of the vegetables on her pizza tasted canned and were nearly inedible. We both picked everything off and ended up eating mostly dough and sauce which were good! . n nIf Santa Lucia steps up and starts buying fresh ingredients to pair with their great pizza dough and sauces, it could really shine.",1
"note this review is about the two times i've been in the last week. RA use to be a regular spot for me when i lived in LA. i use to work lazy dog cafe and we'd all go after our shift. happy hours are awesome! n nvisit 1 my boyfriends parents were in town for his graduation. they were staying a TI and were looking for somewhere close to grab lunch. we figured RA would be a great place to check out and they have pretty awesome lunch specials. we sat in the dining room and our server was awesome! i cant say that for the host, exactly, but our server was definitely amazing! the bf's family is from hawaii and so is she, so they bonded fairly quickly . everyone ordered a bento, except for me i ordered the bara chirashi bowl and his dad ordered the viva las vegas roll . food was delicious! the bowl was SO filling! hamachi, salmon and tuna sashimi, rice and avocado. i barely finished it! it was a perfect lunch simple and satisfying. n nvisit 2 his parents had us watch their suite while they were away, and we wanted to go somewhere we could walk to. so RA happy hour it is! we ordered a tsunami punch fish bowl was 13 and the baby tsunami punch was 6. we were gonna get 2 anyway, so we opted for the regular price fish bowl . we also ordered short ribs, wings, salmon carpaccio, edamame and seaweed salad. bill was about 40. our server at the bar was awesome as well tracy . we needed a few boxes and still have quite a bit of our fishbowl left. i think she noticed we were full and the itis was about to kick in, and since its on the strip you're able to take your drink with you in a to go cup i had no idea that was possible! im so use to places saying no! . we left there full and completely satisfied. n nthanks RA sushi! n ndefinitely check out happy hour! quite a bit of tapas and rolls available on the menu, and some pretty awesome drink specials too! pictures to come soon! and i think i creeped out the guy who was sitting next to me. it was kinda dark in there, so every time i took a picture of my food, the bright flash from my blackberry went off. after we got our food, he switched to seat on the other side of the bar .",2
"AHHH this place is so bad. n nAll the times I have to be in this miserable airport I've seen this place, usually packed. I was able to sit down and try them out for breakfast last flight I took to Boston. n nBreakfast was awful. Their ingredients are not fresh. I was pained while trying to finish my food. Bloody Mary horribly made. n nThe decorations don't make up for food quality. Don't kid yourselves. On another note. it is airport food. I shouldn't have expected any better.",1

"I've been to Yard House many times in Town Square. It's good place to go when you want to drink and catch up with friends while getting some good food. This was my first time at the location in the Linq. Everything was really clean, spacious, and lively. Aaron, our server, was friendly, made sure our waters were kept full and was very attentive. nI didn't really care for their jerk boneless wings. The sauce was on the side and I feel like it needed some breading, it was kind of weird. Parmesan crusted chicken was good. It had a mushroom and sun dried tomato sauce. My boyfriend got the New York Steak Sandwich so I had to steal a bite and it was good also! I thought it was going to be strips of steak but it's the actual full New York steak on a sandwich with tomato and onions. nSome of my favorites are the Mac and Cheese, definitely not your typical Mac and cheese. It has truffle oil and it is just delicious! I also like almost all of their burgers, I've yet to try their late night truffle burger you can tell I'm a sucker for truffle lol . I also really love their grilled cheese and tomato bisque. The bisque has a nice basil flavor and I always add bacon to the grilled cheese, because well, everything's better with bacon right? For appetizers I love the nachos. It's a really big portion though, maybe too big for only two people. I also really like the lobster, crab, and artichoke dip. nFor drinks, I usually get one of their martinis or specialty drinks and I've yet to be disappointed! Overall I love this place and will definitely be coming to the linq location more often!",2
"I have been to both the downtown and the South Side McCormick Schmick's several times. They rarely disappoint. n nTheir menu is quite extensive, changed daily to reflect seasonal fish and ingredients. I always choose something interesting from their cocktail menu, as they have a scratch bar with fresh ingredients. n nMcCormick's has some very good soups and several salads to choose from, although they cost extra to add to your entree. I will admit that many of their appetizers don't tickle my fancy. I do, however, love the crab dip. It is great for sharing. If you like oysters, they have over 5 varieties available on the half shell. Their mussels are also excellent. n nIf you are there for lunch, they have over ten entrees for under 10, which is a pretty good deal. n nMy favorite dinner entree is the Salmon stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie. The serving size is rather small, but the taste is wonderful! n nThey also have an extensive wine list and delicious dessert menu. Try the chocolate bag with passion fruit mousse and fresh berries. It's divine!",2
"My boyfriend and I wanted to have a fancy night out, without wandering too far afield. Atrias fit the bill. We were seated promptly without a reservation. Our server Angelina maybe Angelique was phenomenal. We each got something from the bar. He was offered a frosted glass with his newcastle, and my margarita 5 margarita night was delicious. Our meals were delivered promptly. He ordered the seafood pasta and I got the ahi tuna Both were delicious. My ahi tuna was particularly exceptional. n nThe waitstaff was very friendly, and while we were there, the manager was visable on the floor. As someone who as worked in the service industry, I find this is usually a good thing. n nWe will definitly go again!",2
"If I could give this company a zero rating, I would. Dealing with this management company is just a nightmare. Our hallways, stairwells, and foyer have not been swept and mopped in months. Our garbage shoot is backed up to our floor, which is the second floor. It has caused a rodent problem, not only in the trash area, but in each unit. We were watching television the other night when we heard a squeaking sound. We looked up and there was a mouse on the ledge overhanging our twelve foot ceiling. Just disgusting! Who wants to have to worry about rodents and garbage overflowing in the garbage shoot. I and others have called multiple times to get the place swept and the trash and dust bunnies just keep piling up. It is starting to look like a housing project and the property is approximately five years old. DO NOT USE THIS MANAGEMENT PROPERTY OR YOU WILL BE SORRY!",1
"I loved lobster me before the menu change. I have no issue paying 23 27 for a large lobster roll, but I won't pay 17 for what amounts to a lobster slider. The quality of the meat and bread is great, but the size available now is great if you're a child or over 85 and don't eat like an adult. Last visit.too bad.",1
"I was not impressed with this restaurant. n nFrom what I have heard the restaurant has changed chefs if there is a chef and you can tell as this place has an identity crisis. It is stuck between a formal Italian restaurant and a modern trendy restaurant which just leaves it as an awkward ambiance. n nWe went on a Thursday night and sat in a side room they had. The night started off on the wrong foot with our waiter who made it apparent that he was not sure what he was doing by how he was acting. n nThings continued down hill as we received our appetizers. We ordered an olive plate, shrimp, muscles and calamari. It all seemed too prepared in advance and came out modestly warm. When our entrees came out we had the same experience. The food tasted alright, but nothing to think twice about. n nWe also ordered desserts including ice cream and fried custard. From the reactions at the table, the ice cream was good and they do have a lot of different flavors, but the fried custard was not what i expected. I was expecting more of a Mexican fried ice cream, but received warm fried custard with pistachios which I was not expecting. I will give this dessert the benefit of the doubt as I bet some people would have enjoyed it. n nOverall I cannot recommend this restaurant.",1

"I live about 30 minutes away from PoP's and the prices are a bit high, so we don't get there more than once every couple of months. I don't mind spending 10 12 for a good cheesesteak, but I'm sorry to say this will be the last trip. They no longer use Amoroso rolls, but they kept the price the same. Everyone who is a cheesesteak junkie or at least from Philly knows that a REAL cheesesteak is made with an Amoroso roll. NO SUBSTITUTE will work. Either go back to using Amoroso rolls or lower your prices by 3. These cheesesteaks are NO LONGER the PoP Pride Of Philly. They are just like all the rest now. nIMPORTANT NOTE On PoP's website if you click on ""The Perfect Cheesesteak "", here is what they say about the rolls in part n "".Cheesesteak perfection begins with the bread. POP's bread is baked in Philadelphia by the world famous Amoroso Baking Company which has been in business since early in the 20th century. Of course, it costs a lot of money to buy bread in Philadelphia and have it shipped to Las Vegas, but we figure that the bread is such an important ingredient for the most delicious cheesesteak, that we insist on serving only the best.

"I live in Sun City Grand, so this place is convenient, the food is OK, and there's a spectacular view. That's as good as it gets. The problems are that it is usually under staffed, so there is generally only one server for the entire place prior to 9 a.m. the place opens at 6 a.m. It often takes a long time to be seated, and it's hard to seat yourself, since many of the empty tables still need to be cleared after the prior customers have left. My main complaint is that they advertise ""fresh baked "" but then serve MICROWAVED biscuits that are sitting in a plastic bin on the counter behind the cash register. These are not at all fresh, and microwaving day old or older biscuits just turns them to rubber. Even though I always ask for non cholesterol egg substitute and dry toast I won't order the biscuit any more , I know that the server or the kitchen gets it wrong when I can see egg white in my scrambled eggs butter slathered over the ""dry "" toast. With the light staffing, it's almost impossible to get a refill on water or coffee before you've finished your meal. I've also been there for lunch dinner later in the day, and the service is a bit better.",1
"The Skinny the food not with a ten foot pole! 1 , the service is crap 0 . n nCraving some Hawaiian BBQ after coming back from Hawaii, my hubby insisted on coming here for a taste Hawaii. n nI tried the Kalua pork and my husband had the curry chicken katsu. n nAlthough the portion sizes are enormous, I can't overlook the fact that the food isn't that great. Just the smell of the Kalua pork was off putting something about it made me nauseated. The flavour was of over seasoned canned meat. The watery yes, watery! texture of the pork is an insult to the whole concept of salted roasted pork. n nThe chicken katsu curry was also watery and rather bland. n nGiven other great Hawaiian places so close by, it's hard to justify coming here. n nFInally, FYI bring your own water if you do decide to try this place. n nWhen I asked for a glass of tap water, the cashier woman said the only water available was the bottled water. Then she proceeded to hand a plastic cup filled with watered down Thai iced tea to my hubby. n nI'm not stupid. You have plastic cups, you can fill it with tap water. 'Nuff said. n nFor that reason, this place gets a big fat one star I would give it zero stars if I could.",1

"If you are a woman, or plan to bring any woman in your foursome do not play here. There are no woman tees so you have to tee off from the mens tees. There are many big carries so its obvious the customer they are looking for are only men. I made the reservation, spoke to the golf shop twice, checked in, and was told I needed to play from the mens tee box by our caddy! VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. The round was a disaster as you would expect, and I was mad the whole time. I wrote a letter to Steve Wynn letting him know my disappointment and felt that I should have been made aware of this in advance so ""as the customer I could decide if I still wanted to play at his property, and not be shocked when the caddy announced it to me on the 1 tee box!

"Oh how i love to wander away from the strip to find something worth eating and this place is one of them. The decor is nice very hip and modern looking. the service is friendly. sushi is definately fresh. What made this place special to me was that not was it only sushi but it's a robata grill. the food felt like it's for izakaya. Little snackable foods to eat while you drink. the only downfall for it and it's not the reason i took off a star, but the problem is that it's pretty far from the strip.",2
"Had high expectations since a lot of my friends raved about it. First off, the service is horrible. Took about 15 mins to get seated when it wasn't even that busy.

"What can I say. Parts Score has earned my trust 1000 . Jason is an extremely detail oriented person. His followup and documentation is unreal. His shop and work area is spotless and his work speaks for itself. Leah the shop manager follows up to provide updates and even emails you pictures of the progress! They snapped some teasers of my car before I was able to pick it up! Very cool and personable touch! n nThus far he PartsScore has done performance mods for me suspension H R coilovers , APR stage I II, and some custom exhaust fabrication when aftermarket parts were not readily available . Also check with him before you order and European parts, he could of gotten me a better deal on some of my hardware. n nHe will also be taking over the general maintenance for my car as he cannot be beat in terms of service cost compared to the dealer plus its always awesome to see what else they are working on back there.

Knock on wood I don't need it but if I do, Jason and the team at Part Score will definitely hear from me. Thanks for taking care of not only me but also my VW CC. n nYou guys are the best!",2
"I love Tasty Kabob! Their food is always excellent, and I try to make it back there whenever I return to the Valley. I always order their chicken shish kabob entree, which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables. The chicken is always tender, well marinated, and equally well seasoned. Their beef shish kabob entree is also very good. Try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor, or just enjoy it as is. It's difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes, but their hummus is always creamy and smooth, and I love their shirazi salad. Their spicy beans dish, however, is, by far, my personal favorite, and I always make sure to order it. Just as important as the food is the friendly service I encounter whenever I visit. The couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome. Good food and service that makes you feel at home, what more can you ask for? Simply put, Tasty Kabob is one of the best.",2
"It is not worth the price at all. We found bones in our salmon dish, a piece of shell in the urchin. I was wondering if it is normal for a 90 tasting menu? n nThe service was unprofessional. Our waitress obviously did not have a clue how many courses were in the tasting menu. She kept telling us this would be the final course, and bummm, five minute later we got another one. The most ridiculous thing was when she was presenting one of the dishes, she mistaken an olive for a pear. And yes, PEAR. How the hell was that even remotely possible? n nAnd more about the food, since I know their fish supplier. There is nothing new surprising to me on the raw ingredients they use. All it left here is the chef's skill, and how well mr.park put they together. The strongly sour sauce definitely ruined my urchin. And my salad was like someone pours 1 ton of sea salt on top of it. n nThe only reason I gave it a 2 star is for freshness of the raw ingredients, that's all, not the skills.",1
"Completely disappointed! I went this past Sunday night with a party of 3. We ordered about 7 or 8 dishes and not one was outstanding. They were just ok, with the standout being the bacon wrapped dates which were just awful. We ordered wines by the glass, and they were small amounts of wine. I'm not talking about just because it's in large glasses. The wine pours were small. Overall I just felt frustrated that I'd spent 300 in this place and felt like going to McDonald's afterward which I didn't . I see zero reason to ever go back here. The positives are a nice atmosphere and cool furniture. The food is just bad to mediocre there's so many better restaurants in Vegas!",1
"I am so ready for our contract to be done! We have had nothing but trouble since the beginning. They installed the dish right next to the electric lines on our roof, then another tech had to come back out a couple of months later and re wire the whole house. It took us 4 months and a call from the presidents office to get the internet connection that was supposed to be done at install and have the 100 charge removed for it! Then at 1 year our bill doubled! After multiple calls we were told by an advanced solution expert, that the only discount they could give us is to cut our channels and paperless billing and take 10 off! Seriously?! When I told him I could get internet and the same amount of channels I have from cox for what I am paying now locked in for 2 years he THREATENED me by telling me I was still in a contract and better not break it until October!

" ""peet suh "" ""peetsa "" ""peedtza "" ""pittsa "" n nHowever you say it, this is one of the best of its kind throughout the valley! Situated at The District in Green Valley Ranch, this location is quite big with plenty of seating either the inside dining room or the outdoor patio that can accommodate even a fairly large group. There's also a nice bar setup with flat screen TVs, making the restaurant a great place to watch any sporting event. n nBeing Napoletana, the pizza is cooked for about a minute in a wood burning oven. This isn't your typical NY style pizza where it can be picked up and folded in half. Instead, the use of cutleries is advised while eating this pizza since the crust is thin and soft which doesn't hold up especially if you stock up on toppings. n nOut of multiple visits, everything I've had from this place so far has been really good. I usually like to start with Panzanella or Involtini di Prosciutto. As far as their pizzas, I prefer the ones with crushed tomatoes classic Margherita mozzarella, basil, Parmigiano Regiano , the Carbonara pancetta, egg, mozzarella and the Settebello pancetta, wood oven sausage, roasted mushrooms, toasted pine nuts, mozzarella, basil . Fresh ingredients, bold flavors and great topping combinations. I normally have the 12 inch pizza to myself which doesn't leave any room for dessert. If you can, however, go for their dessert pizza sliced bananas, drizzle of Nutella and dusted with powdered sugar . n nOverall, Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana is definitely one of the best pizza joints in Las Vegas. Delicious food, pleasant ambiance and excellent service. I will definitely be coming back.",2

"Hands down, this is probably my favorite nightclub in Vegas so far. n nThe breakdown n nVenue I am so glad XS has both an indoor and outdoor area, which means more room to breathe! I am so glad I do not have to be gasping for air anymore! Personally, I like the outdoor area a lot more because there is more room to dance and people are also allowed to stand in the shallow parts of the pool which provided my aching feet with some relief. Darn those heels. During my second time here during Memorial Day weekend, people actually jumped into the pool with their clothes on and they did not get kicked out of the club so if you are down for that than be my guest but don't take my word for it because I am not for certain if this is acceptable or not! n nDrinks Both times here, my girls and I got free complimentary drink tickets so that was awesome! On top of that, they were redeemable for any drinks that was up to a 20 value so say hello to the AMF's and Sex on the Beach! n nMusic I have seen Diplo and David Guetta here. I cannot really comment much on Diplo because I probably only stayed an hour or so that day but David Guetta is definitely good at what he does. I literally dance until his set ended! n nOkay, after reading through this review you are probably wondering why I did not give this place a 5 star review right, well the reason behind why is because during my first time here I was almost punched in a face by a drunk guy, some drunk girls trampled my feet causing bruises that took forever to go away and on top of that I had a bouncer shove me so hard that I fell back onto my friend, definitely did not appreciate that SIR! n nOverall, a really nice club when I am in the outdoors !",2
"The food at Dragon Noodle is actually worth 3 stars, but I'm downgrading to 2 stars for the exorbitant prices they charge. The XO string beans and the salt pepper calamari were good, but the noodles that you'd expect to be good, weren't. It's worth the cab ride to Noodle Palace on Spring Mountain. Even with the cab fare, your lunch would still cost less.",1
"I had been to Olive and Ivy before for wine and flat breads on the patio and thought it was good, but when we finally came for dinner on April 24th, the experience was excellent. We didn't have a reservation, so we made our way to the bar for a glass of wine. The hostess texted us when our table became available, which was a large comfy booth clad in a beautifully patterned fabric. Our waiter was engaging and attentive, and the food was superb. The people watching is added bonus, there were lots of interesting sleeve tattoos on the staff, and tables of rich blonde debutantes.I noticed a couple of metrosexual guys at the bar with Restalyn injections and nose jobs which is a pretty common sight in Scottsdale . Anyway about the food, we started with the hummus and veggies which was obviously house made and delicious. My entree was the Pacific sea bass, which, as the waiter explained, is substituted with a cousin to sea bass that is not endangered but just as tasty. The braised cauliflower was great, and the portion was perfect. The preserved grapefruit was the perfect touch, the dish needed no augmentation. My partner had the scallops which were amazing, and our relatives had the filet and added a small side of shrimp to make it a surf and turf, they loved it. We shared a lemon tres leches cake with berries for dessert that was mouth watering. The place is always packed and it's easy to see why. Beautiful ambiance and terrific food!",2

I stayed here for 2 nights Feb 25 27 of 2014. The hotel was in a great location on the strip and the room was clean.,2
Friendly staff. Food is awesome. Drinks for happy hour great. Always a place to make you feel at home.,2
" ""Would you like some stamps or ice with that? "" n nWith my Snickers bar? No thanks, they don't go well together. How about this, Circle K. ""If I wanted stamps or ice I WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR THEM! "" n nUgh, I can't stand this Circle K. Always trying to up sell me on shit I don't need. It ain't that clean either. It's jam packed with the many farm and construction workers in the area so it is convenient for them. The location earns them a second star since there isn't much in the area. Also, Circle K fixed their overcharging for 5 Hour Energy drinks by offering a 2 for 5 reg and 2 for 6 extra strength special. I don't know, probably still too much for them, but they help me get through the day.",1
"Bought another restaurant.com certificate and my brother in law joined us for another go at Aureole. This time we sat in the main dining room which offers a stunning view of the wine tower. We saw a couple angels fetch bottles. But otherwise, I much prefer the intimacy and extra level of service experienced in swan court. n nWe all ordered wine by the glass, the husband and I ordered of the menu and BIL chose the market menu. n nCombined we started with clam chowder, onion soup and the pear tart with duck proscuitto. While nothing was outstanding, all three whet our appetite and we were ready for more. n nThen for the main course we had Waygu skirt steak, the rack of lamb and the scallops. The steak had fantastic flavor, but it was very chewy, likely due to the cut of meat. As good as the flavor was I couldn't help but think it was like beef flavored bubble gum tasty while you chew, but you don't want to swallow it. The scallops were huge and nicely prepared, but the vanilla apple compote was simply too sweet for my liking and I thought it completely overwhelmed the dish. The star of the meal was the lamb. Rich and meaty, just plain delicious. I also ordered ratatouille for us to share. It was very good. n nThe dinner was good, but it should have been better. We left pretty disappointed.",1
"I stopped by Bamboo Bistro because I used to go there a lot when it was Pho Hoang, a nice little family run spot. My girlfriend told me she liked a BB that she went to so I decided to try it out. n nFor me, the pho experience is all about the quality taste of the broth. When I got my pho tai the broth was only warm not piping hot so it was hardly ""cooking "" the rare steak. The chicken wing appetizer just looked scary! n nI'll keep going down the street to Jenni Pho.",1
"The breakfast burrito was not a good start to the day. If you order the bacon version be prepared for an avalanche of fatty bacon pieces with hardly any eggs or potatoes. It was a bad experience trying to salvage this item, but if I would have eaten it all with all that bacon, then a heart attack was not far behind. Would not recommend that item at all.",1
"Just had one of the best meals of the year! Everything was delicious from the starter bread to the last bite. The side of coleslaw was absolutely perfect, and would've been a better meal than most places by itself. Lump crab Amazing, Caesar salad fresh and crisp. Main course was everything we were hoping for and some. Service was a delight and the atmosphere was alive and well, without being too loud. Can't wait til our next visit.",2
"Their croissant is the kingpin of Montreal's pastries. I have tried so many great bakeries in town, but I keep coming back to this one. People prefer their croissants for various reasons though, but here's why I love theirs moist, silky soft and unrestrainedly buttery inside, always served warm and humbly crunchy outside. It's NOT one of those croissants that will leave a flaky mess on your skirt or pants , which are just as delicious and probably the preference of some people. If that's your kind of croissant, go to Fous Desserts.",2
"Service is great, waitress is fantastic. Pizza muffins are a perfect idea, you could just have those and be happy but you would be missing out on a great pizza.",2
"Finally! I found my favorite yogurt place. I've only come across franchise shops, and was never very impressed. The decor and layout was thoughtfully designed with bar seating along the main window for superb people watching and a sweet comfy lounge area for great conversation and yogurt eating. Patio seating is available too. Besides the yogurt, I loved the stack of sketch books and cups of colored pencils for guests to doodle! n nNow, on to the most important thing YOGURT! Hands down, the most flavorful and refreshing. Some chains compromise quality in order to provide 15 flavors, but this place didn't need to. Also, the yogurt was flavored perfectly w o too much artificial flavoring. n nFavorites n1. Caramel w cheesecake bits .and I don't even like caramel, but this converted me! n2. Strawberry banana n3. Cheesecake w oreos n4. I got a sorbet I think too, can't remember the name but it was wonderful! n5. Fantastic, personable employees! I only spoke with a woman who was working, but she was so nice and friendly. Also, right when we walked in we were immediately greeted. n nI will never buy fro yo anywhere else. Unless I happen to be traveling outside Phoenix!",2
I have been going there to see Larry once a month for several years now. I have arthritis in all my joints and he has been able to keep me moving and active. This isn't the type of la la massage you get at a day spa. It's real therapeutic massage. They deserve 10 out of 10 stars! The staff is friendly and Larry is amazing. He is well trained and intuitive. He's kind of a cross between physical therapist and masseur. Do it! Do it! Do it!,2
"Great customer service and very good on refills. We waited for 20mins for early dinner. The hostess and staff were very friendly. Our food came on time. We order shake, fries, and couple of burgers and girly drink. Great burgers and fries. The shake was delicious too since there was chocolate pudding at bottom of shake. Besides the food, I love the menu with Gordon face on it. The utensils, especially the knife was a interesting design. Anyway, I highly recommend this place. Great food and atmosphere!",2
"Tom Speaks is an awesome real estate agent. He truly cares about his clients and makes sure they get the house of their dreams. If you need an honest real estate agent that will take the time to find that perfect home for you, I highly recommend Tom!",2
"I did not have a great experience. Past ultrasound techs have made me feel so welcome, but not here. I was told it was ok to bring my 18 month old son and because he wanted to wonder the room she said ""are you sure you want another one "" not my idea of a joke to say to a pregnant women. She did do the ultrasound but I felt very rushed and will not be going back. I am giving 2 stars because I got to see my baby and know the sex.",1
"Bad service makes you look much harder at the whole package. The low stars are for the service mostly. I went on a Sunday, and I guess my server was too busy to pay attention to me. I was left thirsty. I had to wave her down to get a second beer, and that was after my glass was left empty for almost 10 burger bites. nThe Google search placed this restaurant first, but it's midrange at best. The burger was cooked to order even though the bacon was caramelized. The food was alright, but the price of the beer was too high for its high service price. I left with a bad taste in my mouth, burger onion not the beer .",1
"Friend got a table here the day before their grand opening aka Eve of NYE. nYa daaayuuum skimpy I was bout to start my NYE wknd at one of Vegas' new clubs. Especially since it wasn't, officially, open.so, it wasn't going to be packed to the rim with ppl. n nI immediately fell in love with the view our table had. We were right by the window and had a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains, Paris, and Planet Hollywood. It was sooooo beautiful that I didn't mind the fact that I was kinda of freezing my ass off. Lets face it I was, practiacally, wearing nothing lol n nPlace was small but, it's a lounge so it's to be expected. nI was just excited to check out a new spot on the Strip! Music was on point hip hop top 40, of course! n nAnd from what I remembered and piecing things together with friends I had the time of my life! hahhahaa nHAPPY NEW YEAR'S ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL",2
"I've always loved their food and a Hot Dog lover, however a few months ago I became vegetarian.Anyway, found out they have Veggie dogs and like veggie dogs in general.OMG, so good and so happy that a place like Ted's has evolved to current times and cater to people who are vegetarian.They're a real hot dog company, if only QT would now sell Veggie dogs, I'd be real happy. Love their fries a lot as well. SUPER YUM!",2
"You just can't get better food for your money. Filet kebab just melts in your mouth and the chicken filet kebab is to die for. As for fesenjan, well I've died and gone to heaven. The service is great and we always have food to take home and eat the next day. No better food in town, literally. I'm hungry just writing this.",2
place is yummy! 1.50 ice cream is a steal and at 2.00 for an ice cream sandwhich everyone should be screaming for ice cream!,2
"This is basically Il Fornaio it is run by the same company. I reserved for about 15 there for a bachelorette dinner. They gave us a private room overlooking the piazza for which they did not charge us extra, and it was just beautiful. We cocktailed, dined, wined and desserted with appetizers and with a generous tip it was less than 40 a person. You couldn't find treatment like this in many cities.",2
"Service was terrible! I sat at the counter and watched my food sit under the heat lamp for over 5 minutes before it was brought to me . The waitress never came back to see if I wanted anything else. I did, by the way . She never even refilled my ice tea. I won't be returning anytime soon.",1
"Literally THE wost company known to human kind. I almost converted to an Amish community because of this horrid company. The world needs to know how terrible this company is, lies, deceit, if you work for aps you should feel ashamed. I paid my bill 3 weeks early, I give them my bank act info same as every other bill I pay, cox, credit card ect. then I get a call 2 days after my bill was due, we are talking 3 weeks after I posted my bill, saying that there was a problem with my payment and now I will get charged with a late fee! I get charged for their mistake, then I pay by phone and get slapped with a 5 dollar inconvenience fee. Ban aps. Hopefully capitalism plays a role and some better electric company and stomps them.",1
I love going to Scottsdale Hand And Foot Spa.The spa is beautiful and they are always creative with the designs. I highly recommend them.,2
"I didn't know this was an Bobby restaurant until I was here and it didn't disappoint. The bread was great, and the server recommended the goat cheese appetizer. I'm not a huge fan, but on the suggestion, I let my wife convince me otherwise. She barely got to eat any of it! For my meal, I had a pork tenderloin with some amazing sweet sauce on it I ate it so fast, I don't remember what was in it. Will definitely be back, especially since I consumed too much alcohol at the craps tables later that night and didn't get a chance to finish digesting!",2
"This is my new Vegas touchstone. Itinerary will read arrive Las Vegas, check into hotel, walk to the nearest Fat Tuesday partake. I recommend the 36 oz reusable cup! The other souvenir cup that holds the same volume of your choice of delicious ice cold slushie is a bit unwieldy. I'm just saying that it won't fit in your cup holder in the car. Not that it should when it's carrying an alcoholic beverage. n nI've tried the following strawberry with rum, pi u00f1a colada, Miami Vice mix of strawberry and pi u00f1a colada , 190 Octane whooo , Hurricane, and a bright blue mixture that tasted like it was just that bright blue. I personally am more of a fan of the strawberry, pi u00f1a colada, and Miami Vice because a sip won't necessarily overpower me. Though I did get my first Fat Tuesday drink with a shot of Everclear. That was a surprisingly powerful kick, when I finished my blended drink only to slurp up half a shot of Everclear grain alcohol. n nAnyway, from now on I refuse to walk anywhere in Vegas without a Fat Tuesday drink in my hand. To those who've never been, I'd describe it as a cross between a 7 Eleven and a bar. I wish all Slurpees tasted this good.",2
"This restaurant is not good. The customer service sucks and everything you order something on the menu.the waiters waitresses get it wrong every time. It takes so long to get your food and their Irish stew is way too salty. Yuck! n nI ordered a salad with my burger and I didn't get it but I got something else instead and also, on top of that, the staff wanted a tip in spite of their inferior customer service. n nI'm a proud Irishman and I have to say the service and quality of food at this Irish pub is a disgrace to Ireland and Irish people. This farce of a restaurant brings a tear to my eyes and leaves my stomach aching with searing pain and many visits to the toilet! n nFor shame! I will not return to this restaurant if my life depended on it!",1
Good price for the different buffets but not all the buffets are good. Do not try if you have more than 8 people. All the buffets will charge you gratuity each time before sitting and if you don't pay they will make your family and friends split even if there's an open table next to you. Paris was a HORRIBLE experience. Service was horrible and they made it so complicated for my whole family to sit together even though there was an open table next to us. Food in Paris wasn't all that great either except for the crepes. Rio is the best buffet. But it's hard to eat so much in 24 hours especially since its a buffet. So make sure you split your time wisely to try as many buffets as you can in 24 hours.,1
"My boyfriend and I have been here twice now, and have only had one thing we wouldn't order again. the scallop and shrimp ceviche . It was a little bland, but everything else was AWESOME. n nWe had n nJalapeno Crab Cakes YUM nAngus Burger so juicy nChicken Medici soooo good! nLemon butter chicken good, but not as good as other chicken picatta dishes i have had. nFettucine Pelligrino good, but a little heavy for me. boyfriend loved it. n nThe drinks have always been great for us, and we always sit at the bar. The service great and the bartenders are always so friendly. n nLOVE IT! Give it a try, despite the cranky people leaving bad reviews. You NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY!",2
"Its this one Sunday where i over slept and wake up feeling i have lost the whole day. Had a quick bite and drove around and stumble upon Ahwatukee CC. As i remember one of my colleague told me a must play course. So without checking the web, i went in pay for twilight and start my round. Overall is a public municipal course and its old and abused without much care. Flat and pretty much surrounded my houses. If i had to force it i would say its the longer PAR 3 where there is water hazard on the left that i could remember maybe . That day the pin was tug left and i usually draw my shot so its a little intimidating to attack, plus the sun setting in the horizon is right in the middle of my face when teeing off. Very cheap but i won't go back unless i am given a free round with my buddy while i don't have other priority.",1
"A Yardhouse representative reached out to me after I posted a review about my experience here at this location. Her sincere apology earned this location more stars. Although they have not replied back to the email they've asked me to send them, I think any establishments that goes out of their way to deeply listen to their clients about their concerns and experience earns kudos from me.and possibly.note POSSIBLY another visit.",1
"Maybe some of my surprise came from not having been to any new Burger Kings of late, but I was really surprised when my husband and I went in to this location yesterday morning we had a craving for fast food breakfast and saw that it was all decked out in a Hollywood theme. It had sleek colored booths, framed pictures of movie stars, and get this pendant lighting! Granted, pendant lighting has become as ubiquitous in restaurants as jukeboxes used to be, but it's still strange that fast food franchises have even jumped on the decor bandwagon. Anyway, the people working at this location are super friendly, although the staff does tend to be more motivated when a location is relatively new this one is about a year old , and the food we got was to be expected. I do love BK's French Toast Sticks for a nutrition less but delicious Saturday morning breakfast, and my husband's sausage muffin was good although he ordered it with egg and cheese and didn't get them . To sum it up, this is a good location as far as Burger Kings go, but in the end, it's just Burger King, which is never really all that great.",1
"When I used to work in downtown Phoenix, I would sometimes make the drive out to 44th and Indian School just to get me some fish tacos. The staff is pretty friendly here, it's a large space with a great patio, and clean! n nWhile I have a wealth of Mexican to choose from in AZ, I really do love Rubios, chain or not. I've been going to them all over the Valley since they first started opening. Solid menu, cheap, and satisfying. Love their salsa bar. 1.50 fish tacos, burros under 5, mmmmmm.",2

"I had hoped for more. The service was OK. Not great. The food was also OK, not great. This got a 28 Zagat rating and I have no idea how. I would try it one more time and my wife would not. So we are not going back. Even the bread was bad. Blah.",1
"It was ok. Expected the gyro to have more flavor and be WARMER. Really average food, and kind of spendy for the average quality.",1
 6 for a 2 hour ticket is far too much. They know how they get the money from Las Vegas tourists. n nYou also have to calculate time for this bus ride because sometimes you walk faster than this bus.,1
"Just found out that area 15 has a food truck rally every Thursday. I had the chicken hibachi and it was delicious. The only thing was I would have liked more chicken in place of all the veggies but that's only because I'm a meat eater over veggies any day. Also, their shrimp sauce is awesome. I can never get enough of that stuff and I think they make their own. Super satisfied!",2
"Wow, this place is trying VERY hard to be bro party central waitresses are chosen for looking good in the revealing uniforms than their skill in the service industry, music is loud bro jams, and MMA is all over the TVs. n nVisit 1 I sat at a table with a friend. Even though there were only two occupied tables in the place, our waitress seemed overwhelmed our order for a second round of drinks never happened and she messed up our check. We had two sandwiches which were greasy but pretty good. n nVisit 2 I sat at the bar with a few friends. This time service was much better. Beer and wings were on special, so that's what we had. The wings were a little better than standard bar food. n nOn the upside, there are daily specials on food and drinks. It's above average greasy bar fare but it's not like they're promising find cuisine and health food.",1
How can this be a 5. The ruben sandwich was half warm and did not have great flavor.,1
"yum, one of my favorite places for brunch, simply because their bananas foster french toast is to fricken die for! nSeriously, it would be on my list of last meals. I would really like to try more there but I love that stuff so much. The boy got a crab meat omelet the last time we went and he loved that as well! And their creamy potato concotion is awesome! The bloody's aren't very great though. nIf you are looking for a place for brunch, check it out!",2
"Its Applebees, nothing wow about it, just the happy hour deal. Came to this place one evening on a weekday with my brother and his Fiance for drinks. There was a woman at the table next to us who honestly should had been cut off a long time ago, she was so sauced up, loud and obnoxious that our time spent there was ultimately just unpleasant, after much observation, she seemed to know the staff, what do you know, she works there. UNPROFESSIONAL. Not returning to this location anytime soon.",1
"A kind of scary looking hole in the wall shack that makes really incredible BBQ bacon cheeseburger. Thick bacon slices, real cheddar cheese, a tasty burger patty made this burger under 7 is a bargain. The garlic romano fries were tasty but not ""really "" garlicy. Thin and crispy, like those from Inn N Out, so the mild taste goes well with the crunchy texture like flavored potato chips, but better .",2
"As a buyer, I like Colleen's but as a seller.I understand accept their terms of the seller receiving 50 of the price the subsequent price reductions. I agree they should charge the 50. pick up fee but if the furniture sells, it should be refunded. What is unacceptable is the 1.00 check fee to process the check when the item is sold. Come on!",1
"Food is okay but not worth the lengthy wait on weekends. If there were more breakfast choices around this area, TBC would be empty. n nI've ordered breakfast on two occasions here and both times it came out cold, plus the order was messed up. n nThe outdoor patio on the side street is nice but the Scottsdale Road side gets quite noisy with the traffic. n nWait staff and hostesses are nothing fabulous, not overly friendly considering the price and the wait. n nMaybe I should down a couple Malibu drinks before I come for breakfast and it would be a better experience.",1
"This is right on my way to work. Like Amanda, I drove by many times before stopping. I didn't realize it was a chain until after I had my first cup and went to their website when I got to work. But too late, I was hooked. The guys and gals that work their are way nice and the soy in the latte is really good, I have to find out which kind they use. n nOh ya and they are superfast, they have given me my debit card back, stamped my punch card and gave me my coffee in less than a minute, I swear. n nI am a little concerned to go back now that school has started, since they are directly across the street from ASU and I have been spoiled not having to ever wait very long.",2
"What a great place for lunch or dinner. The ambiance inside is not what I expect, I was very impressed and the food is always delicious. It's a fresh look at mexican cuisine and I will continue to recomend it to all who are looking for good restaurants.",2
Good pizza and great wings.,2
"I saved this review for my 100th review on Yelp for a reason. n nI believe it is ""good juju "" to save positive vibrations for those moments that necessitate it. n nThis is a spectacular experience, and deserves no less than ""the Full Monty "" in my book. My wife and I have always tried to impart a sense of cultural appreciation in ourselves and our little one. Because of this, we became members of the Carnegie Museums our first month here in Pittsburgh, and have been nothing short of pleased with the investment. n nI have written a prior review on the full experience of the Carnegie Museums, and fully believe that the whole package is an extremely competitive value for families who want to give themselves a wonderful gift that can make weekends really great the whole year 'round. You get access to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, the Carnegie Museum of Art, The Carnegie Science Center just by Heinz Field, and The Warhol Museum! n nNow, when considering the individual museums, I must say that for us and our little one, this is the crown jewel we come here at least 6 10 times a year, and this has really usurped the Zoo sorry! as our go to place for a quick weekend cultural family activity. Some have complained about having to pay extra for parking, and I agree it would be nice to have 3 parking for members or even a credit card kiosk for parking so we don't have to stop at the ATM and get cash, but overall, this is an incredible buy! n nThey have one of the best dinosaur exhibits I can remember attending. Our little one spends lots of time here, just taking it all in. The geological exhibit is quite honestly the best of its kind that I have ever seen I certainly think it's better assembled and more comprehensive than in many other Natural History museums I've been to. n nThe real amazing part of this museum, however, are the hidden jewels. The Egyptian exhibits the Arctic cultural exhibits the Native American exhibits, the preserved avian specimens tucked in the crosswalk between the main museum and the exhibits listed above all of these are reasons to bring your family here! Every time we come, we discover something new and important. n nIf the above review is not making you want to immediately visit, then I cannot help you. There is a reason so many people give this place 5 stars surely you can visit and make up your own mind. Hope you enjoy it as much as we have! n nWill definitely be back!",2

"have been going this studio for over a year now. I really love going to Jordan's classes. He is the best instructor there he just gives out great energy through out class that I haven't noticed in other instructors. his music selection, volume level of music, and loud voice tone all compliment him as a perfect yoga teacher in my eyes. n nI bought the 30 class package and as long as he continues to teach there, I will continue to practice there. n nThank you Jordan and Sumit! n np.s. I also like that the floors are wood instead of carpet.",2
I babe mixed emotions on how I should rate this place. Let me start of by saying this place has excellent customer service. The employees are super friendly and the guy behind the counter was patient enough to explain the seasoning on the meats I bout 4 different kids and only are 2 of them. This is where zero stars start. The meat was more color than flavor if that makes any since. At first glance you'd think it would be packing flavor since it had all the seasoning on it but no let me tell you how disappointed I was when I went home and cooked it. No flavor at all on the meats. I ended up adding my own seasonings to it which kind of defeats the purpose of paying a little extra for it. n nI ended up dumping the other 2 cuts of meat due to no flavor and the meat was not tender at all. n nIf you want good cuts of meat with tons of flavor at a reasonable price then head over to Larry's meat market,1
"Don't believe the hype. n nSandwiches were just OK and nothing memorable at all. n nMaybe it's the best Montreal has, but I have had better a million times over. Sorry Schwartz. but you sucked.",1
"When I can't get my everyday items like Fresh Fruit, Meat, Seafood, and Deli items fresh and Easy I go here. Better Selection and good quality at good price. I would do all my shopping here but there are some items that I just really like from fresh and easy that is closer to my house.",2
"First understand that if you're from Hawaii, you probably visit Vegas often and always stay downtown never on the strip . This sets the stage for what has become known as the ""Ninth Island "" the California Hotel AKA the ""Cal "" and adjoining Main Street Station both Boyd hotel casinos that cater to the Hawaii crowd . If you've never been to Hawaii before, this is a pretty good cross section of the local community all lovingly united by a constant flow of Bud Light and the chirp of Blazing 7s slot machines. n nI'm a Hawaii transplant now living in the Bay Area, so I especially look forward to Vegas trips for the food. On the mezzanine of the Cal is a small restaurant called Aloha Specialties which IMO has the best local food menu on the mainland. In CA we're limited to Hawaiian BBQ joints like L L which pretty much offer the same spectrum of choices. Aloha Specialties has some of my favorite dishes n nTRIPE STEW Pretty good, could use more and bigger chunks of veggies. Tabasco makes it even better. 4 5 nSAIMIN Not as good as what you get in Hawaii, but far better than the crap they have at places like L L. And it's cheap. 4 5 nBEEF STEW Tastes the way I expect it to and don't understand why other places can't make it see my L L review . 4 5 nPOKE Too sweet. I also prefer the onion sesame oil style 2 5 n nLike I said, I eat here because I don't get good plate lunches and other local food on the mainland. One of life's biggest mysteries is why visitors from Hawaii fresh off of their red eye flights from the land of Kim Chee II, Rainbow's and Helena's will wait in a long line for food they could get back home. That's Hawaii locals for you. Gotta love them. I sure do.",2
"I have to knock a star off my previous review after my latest visit. We went during the typical lunch hour of 12 00 1 00, and the place just did not have it together. I ordered a salad, paid for it, and then was told they were out of lettuce. I then switched to the pizza buffet. There was one pizza out for the entire restaurant, and we were told it would be fifteen minutes before more were provided. It just seems odd that a restaurant that caters primarily to people on their lunch breaks would be so unprepared for lunch.",1
"Being a long time fan of Outback, I decided to try it for lunch. Not such a great idea, as it turns out. They offer unlimited soup and salad, for 7.99 and a few selected other items that can be paired with soup or salad. Bottom line, you are nickel and dimmed to death. If you want a Wedge Salad as opposed to a House or Caeser Salad , it costs 1.00 more if you want French Onion Soup as opposed to Baked Potato Soup , it will cost you a 1.00 more if you want cheese on your burger, it will cost you a 1.00 more. These extra charges were annoying and seemed unnecessary. n nThe Caeser Salad had way too much dressing, the Baked Potato Soup was way too salty and the Outback burger was way too dry maybe I should have paid the extra buck and got cheese! . n nI will stick to dinner at Outback, from now on.",1
My favorite Las Vegas restaurant. Delicious food and first rate service.,2
"I've been to sidebar twice now, for two different and equally fun birthday outings. Getting the obvious things out of the way The bar staff is always very friendly and don't leave you stranded for hours. Parking is plentiful. There is only one bathroom for each gender, which could lead to long waits, but I've never had to, so that's rad. And as both a pro and a con, it is a small space upstairs of a Pei Wei or something and is very intimate and speakeasy esque. n nWhat I find unique about SideBar are the people who fill the space. The first time I was there there was a large group of hispanic ska punks and a grotesque couple doing inappropriate things on a couch in front of everyone. The second time it was more of a post grad crew. Both times everyone mixed well and had a great night. I like that all sorts of people hang out here, even if you are a regular you're likely to meet new, entertaining people.",2
"Great food for special occasions, or just to treat yourself to the good life. . The tequila based aperitif at the end of the meal was indeed a happy ending.",2
"If you're looking for great sushi at a reasonable price, this place is as good as you will find in Vegas. It's a little bit of a haul 15 20 minutes from the strip so you really have to be in the mood for sushi. n nAs far as other dishes, I would recommend you not expend the cab fare. While the black cod soy and hamachi kama were good, I'm just not that big a fan of cod or hamachi. The asparagus and avocado tempura were relatively flavorless and the beef, chicken and shrimp skewers were either overcooked or poor cuts of meat. Avoid the skewers! n nThe service was acceptable but we had a little bit of a language barrier. They were nice and got the food out quick without overlap in dishes.

"I go here to get my prescriptions, since it is close to where I live. The pharmacy staff is always SO rude, and if there was a different pharmacy near my house, I would quit going here all together. Going to pick up my prescription always puts me in a bad mood because of the rudeness of the staff. I may just start driving out of my way to get my prescriptions if the staff doesn't shape up soon.",1
"This review is not a knock on Dunkin Donuts itself, but on this location. I come to this location everyday but not any more. They always are out of donuts and the coolata machine which is the special they are advertising is constantly out of order. Keep in mind, this is not a 1 or 2 time thing, but more of an everyday thing. I have complained to staff and filled out the online survey multiple times. Stack that along with the terrible wait times 15 min yesterday in the drive thru and this has to be the worst run business in town. I only come back bc of it's location but have grown tired of the inconsistency. Get it together DD.",1
"Had the California burrito with carnita meat, was a good meal. I would prefer to any other Mexican food the state of AZ. has! Guess I like tex mex,cause the sinoran food here just sucks!",2
"We went June 22, 2012 for our friends that are getting married. They talked very highly of this place. Well I think highly NOT of this place. We paid for extra items that we didn't ask for, we never got our food till all other 12 people were done with their food. All we did was order the chicken parmigiana. Yes they didn't charge us for it but still. The food was good once we got it. We were left always asking for water and our waiter said he would be back but never did had to ask someone else for water after 5 minutes and then we got it right away. I would not recommend this place!",1
"Great breakfast stop after a long flight from Pennsylvania. In flight snacks suck and we were starving! After picking up rental car and Yelping breakfast we were delighted to find Egg Works. n nService was friendly and fast. Decor was fun and bright. The food was delicious. I had the breakfast burrito and it was stuffed full, hot, and not too greasy. My wife's western omelet was also a huge portion and the potatoes were very tasty. n nA great find that we will definitely visit again. n nThe banana nut muffin was highly recommended but we were stuffed.",2
"You might want to reconsider ordering the PHO. Completely flavorless. My guess would be the broth is made from a powered mix. Add the fact that they charge 10 makes it even worse. Meatballs were rubbery, sliced beef dry and chewy. nOwners need to consider taking this off the menu. Would have sent it back but a co worker went on a lunch run and picked this up for me to go. Gross, Gross Gross.",1
"I started seeing Theresa, for eyelash extensions, in early October I wanted to be ready for my husband's Christmas party I had them before a few years back so I consider myself a bit of a 'pro'. Well, let me tell you, Theresa had them on in HALF the time, for HALF the money with TWICE as many lashes! She is fantastic, I was amazed at the absolute WONDERFUL job she did! n nI decided to keep them on even longer then I was planning, I love them that much!",2
"Unfortunately we were very disappointed! While the decor, the ambience and the menu all looked great the food left a lot to be desired. n nHigh points the eggs were well cooked, the scone was delicious and the bacon on the meat platter was outstanding! n nLow points the veggie patty in the bubble and squeak was undercooked, chunky, under seasoned and the patty was way too thick. The potato hash was undercooked and pretty bland. The breakfast sandwich was only ok. n nService was friendly, and fast.",1
"Over priced, unnecessary procedures, NEVER on time. We had been using this vet since 2003 but now will not return. Started to call prior to appt and told dr is on time, arrive at appt and guess what!?.20 50 minutes waiting. Staff has high turn over, never apologizes for the wait, expensive for mediocre care. The vets do genuinely care about your pet, just not your time or wallet. Surgery was suggested so pursued 3rd and 4th opinions, none of them shared palisades opinions. Disappointed and frustrated. Crappy front desk service, staff never remembers allergies, filthy dirty floors, yep we will go somewhere else less concerned about the bottom line.",1
Worst service I have ever received at a Subway.,1
"Although I loved the decor, I wasn't terribly impressed with the food. My boyfriend and I had wandered over to Schenley Plaza to get a relatively cheap lunch at the Chinese stand, but we found it was still closed for the season. So we decided to give The Porch a try. n nWe each had a pizza I had the margherita pizza and he had the bolognese. The flavor was good but they were overcooked and oily. The pieces literally fell apart as we tried to pick them up off of the cookie sheet. We had to flag our waitress down anytime we needed something i.e. drink refills, the check because she paid no attention at all to the tables. When we asked for a to go box she brought us one small box that we had to stuff the leftovers in, which left us with a box stuffed with deformed, mushy pizza. n nI would be satisfied with The Porch if it were at the right price for what we got, it was definitely not worth it.",1
"Food 4 stars nService 3.5 stars nPrice 3.75 stars n nIt is located in the Chinatown area. We came here for lunch and ordered Eundaegu Maeuntang 17.95 silver cod fish casserole with veggie and mussel in a hot and spicy broth taste very good. We also ordered Galbi Tang 10.95 short rib soup the broth was a bit too rich, which was not the authentic soup base, and the beef was a bit overcooked. n nThe kim chi side dishes were good, but the waitress was not attentive enough to ask if we would like refills. Overall, the food was good, but comparing to the other Korean restaurants located in the next plaza, Mother's Korean Grill is a little overpriced and the service was not as good.",2
"This is the second time I've been here and I am even more disappointed than the first time. First visit, I got a simple pink and white fill. The white tips were uneven, but I didn't notice until I got home. n nI went for my second visit yesterday and tried another nail artist this time. I got a fill, gel design, and eyebrow wax. First of all, If you're going to paint over white tips, you should file them off first. I can see them through my pink gel polish. Second, I got a chevron design on my middle nail and it looks like a joke uneven and thin . Third, she filed my thumbs at uneven lengths. Fourth, my ring fingers were supposed to be silver glitter and you can still see the white peaking through as well. The gel also started peeling right after I left. AND lastly, she basically waxed off most of my eyebrows. They are terribly thin and look horrible. I WILL NOT be coming back here. n nThe only nice thing I have to say about this place is that the entire staff is very nice and sweet, but their work is terrible.",1
"I love sushi. Let me say it again.I LOVE SUSHI. I love it in the morning, I love it in the afternoon, heck, I love it in the evening. n nI stumbled upon Sushi Twister while meeting a friends' friend there for lunch. From the location trop and boulder I thought that it would be ahem, ghetto. Upon walking in you are immediately greeted and the staff is all smiles. You get seated right on the spot, whether its the sushi bar or a table we always opt for the table . n nThe menu has some of the most intriguing and delicious rolls I've ever seen, as well as the favorites of any sushi restaurant. Things like. Rum Jungle roll? Sure! The Mexican roll? Sure! Also they are NEVER stuffed with too much rice.you get the amount of fish you pay for! n nFor price wise, they have all you can eat for 27, which I think is a little pricey, but the rolls definitely make up for it. So why do I only give it 4 stars? Whenever you get all you can eat, there's usually a rule saying you have to eat everything you order. The staff seem to be everywhere, looking at every roll that enters your mouth to make sure you do not share it with someone else like me, who never orders all you can eat sushi since I can only handle 1.5 rolls . n nBut hey, friendly staff, great sushi, drinks always filled, and not as expensive as other sushi restaurants. Try it ",2
"The words ""HELL YES! "" don't even begin to cover how awesome this place is. There are so many crazy flavors here that my limited pronunciation abilities forced me to resort to pointing at the amazing flavors I wanted to order! I would tell you exactly what I ordered but I honestly couldn't say or spell them so I will try to get as close as possible. ""stra cha cha and marzi pah. "" Yeah, good luck!",2
I haven't had waxing done in a very very long time. The staff was nice and the lady I think her name is Rachel sorry if I got the name wrong she was fabulous. I had eyebrow and upper lip wax this time and it didn't hurt as bad as I thought. I didn't felt like they were rushing me in getting it done. I had some concerns after she was done and she was happy to fix whatever I needed. Overall I was pleased.,2
"Pho tasted blain, no flavor . Not good at all. nYou can't split the bill, ok I can accept that but the service was horrible.",1
"Kind of sad pasta fresh has closed but I definitely saw it coming. Once the owner stopped coming in and cooking the food himself, it all went to crap. The last time I ate here Chef Wes the owner was off and the cooks that we're working took no pride in their work, the food was cold and the flavor was way off.",1
"Went in on a Sunday and all that was offered was pre made juice in a refrigerator. I asked the girl behind the counter if they were made today she said yes. After paying about 8 for a 12 oz drink, when I got in my car and drove away I noticed a sticker on the bottom that said Wed. So I would have been better off buying flash pasteurized juice at a supermarket same content only cheaper. If the owners of this establishment continue to do business in this way, they will be out of business in 6 months. I won't be returning.",1
"after staying at the hotel from hell, walking in to this place was like heaven. i just love condo style places. i'm not much of a vegas party girl so i didn't mind being off the strip. there is no casino here so i didn't have to worry about smelling like smoke. n nthe staff is very friendly. check in was at 4 pm but they allowed early check in since there was a room available. the phone rang about an hour later which scared the crap out of me but it was just the concierge calling to say welcome! the one bedroom suite had a full kitchen, dining area, living room, two TVs one in living room and one in bedroom , and patio for the smokers. the chaise in the living room was super comfy! i want one! the bed was even more comfy with the best pillows. i wanted to take them home. the whole place was very cute and cozy. n nthey have happy hour from 5 7 on weekdays, and free continental breakfast every morning. i'm definitely pickin this place for my next vegas trip.",2
"well what do you have to lose when youre trying new eateries, just money right? well, worse case scenario, not coming back. am I not right? nanywho, I decided to give this establishment a shot. I wasnt feeling well and wanted something hot and spicy to go well without waiting too long and I was burnt out on the 'merican fast food . nI was a bit shocked to see pad thai on their menu. for me, thats a no brainer, must get type of meal. It didnt look like what im used to fatter noodles were used vs skinny which im used to . However it met my taste as far as spiciness and overall flavor. The portion was great. Not gettin ripped off on ""heres a spoonful of your entree "" type of meals. The whole to go box was pad thai. nAlso, I ordered the war won ton soup. again, im surprised by the portion size. Then again, Im not gonna complain. The soup was what I was looking for. Yeah, its not panda express, but this place has my business. n nplus portion size and price n nnegative none thus far.",2
Best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte so far. The waitresses are super nice and friendly. I'm Mexican and eat Mexican food all the time so I'm pretty picky but this place hit the spot. I eat here once or twice a week and it's always good.,2
"I'm currently staying there. The hotel doesn't have public microwaves. You have to pay 10 to rent one. They currently have 0 microwaves available to rent. I'm stuck with food that I can't eat. At the Hyatt, they have public microwave a friend of mine is staying there currently . I recommend staying at the Hyatt. Much better than Sheraton. I never heard hotels not having microwaves.",1
"There are a lot of higher end restaurants on the strip, but this is one that's worth seeking out, especially if you're with a group of friends. It's noisy, bright, fun, and not intimate at all, but the food is as tasty and creative as any Tapas restaurant I've been to. n nWhen we sat down they handed us an iPad like tablet with their wine list. Not really a wine person but I am easily amused so I had fun perusing their wine list this way. The waiter did recommend a Rioja that we both liked. n nHighlights of our meal include the Jamon Iberico, the Serena con membrillo, and the berenjenas con miel de ca u00f1a al estilo Malague u00f1o fried eggplant . Oh, and the croquetas. Actually, everything off the fried section of the menu was incredibly delicious. The only flop of the night was the Tortilla de patatas omelet which was flavorless. n nMy wife I spent about 150 including drinks, desert and coffee, and left feeling very full happy. Highly recommended.",2
"We recently stayed at the Aliante during our wedding weekend and had very mixed emotions about our stay. The rooms were nice, modern, clean, and relaxing. The pool was nice, although crowded. n nThe biggest concern we had with Aliante was in our dealings with the sales staff. Throughout the process of booking our stay and arranging group rates for wedding guests it was confusing, frustrating, and deceiving. The deal they were willing to offer us and our wedding party changed each time we talked to them, and the sales staff seemed to turn over just as frequently. As the wedding weekend approached we felt we had finally nailed down terms for our hotel room that we were happy with, only to realize upon checkout that our final total was hundreds of dollars higher than what we had agreed upon with the sales staff. The on duty manager didn't seem to care, refused to adjust the room rate, and told us to take it up with the sales staff the next business day. Upon calling the sales staff they claimed to have no knowledge of our agreed upon rates. Although they refunded some of our money after spending hours on the phone with them and escalating the problem to the sales manager, they never actually honored the rate their sales staff originally quoted us on the phone. n nIf you are dealing with the sales staff at Aliante, get EVERYTHING in writing because anything they say on phone is worth nothing and likely to change from our experience . Unfortunately, we walked away feeling we could not trust them.",1

"My girl friends and I 4 of us decided to book a trip to Phoenix Scottsdale for a 4th of July Best Friend's Birthday Bash.We found the Hilton Squaw Peak, and the ""Casita "" this is a very loosely used term, we later found out and thought, WINNER! We booked it to be arriving on the 4th of July, and heading home on the 6th. Due to the fact that there were 4 of us, I specifically asked for the 2 QUEEN Casita, with MUCH larger balcony No problem! Booked it. nWe arrived quite early, as we were really excited to get there, checked in at the front desk, and provided them with my phone number to call me when my room was ready. You are able to use the pool area prior to check in, which is awesome. What is not so awesome is the ""RESORT POOLS "" are open to the public, like a water park! Now, I am sorry, but when I pay extra to stay at a ""4 Star Resort "" I expect some sort of exclusivity, and with it being the 4th, the place was NUTS! Oh well, we went on our way from the River Ranch, to check out one of the two ""Swim up Bars "".Oh goodness. I cannot even begin to tell you what they consider a ""Swim up Bar "" is an absolute joke. You wade around in the deep end no stools , hoping the inside bartender, in the inside bar, sees you waiving your hands and comes out to get your order. No, this is not a ""swim up bar "". Huge disappointment, this was a pretty large factor when we picked the resort. But oh well we thought, it at least wasn't as busy as River Ranch. nAround 4 pm I receive the call to come and get the room key, WAHOO! We are beyond excited. We check in with no issues, check in staff was friendly, get back in the car and head to our ""Casita "". Our ""Casita Parking Spot "" was taken, nothing they can do too bad, you pay more for the convenience, and ""poof "" it's gone. I was told that unfortunately when I called the front desk not everyone is as courteous a driver as I am, with major sarcasm. The ""Security Guard "" arrived and posted a ""please move "" notice on the other car. Oh well, we thought, we will snag the spot when the probably not resort guest leaves. Head to the door, the key wouldn't work. I called BACK to the front desk, and they stated they had written down the wrong room number, again, no biggie. nWe head upstairs to check out the loft, bedroom. One king bed. Not two queens, one.king. At this point I am starting to get really irritated. I call, for my 3rd time mind you, BACK to the front desk and advise them of the mistake. I spoke with Jonathon Hite, whom he checked the system and stated, yes I had booked 2 queens, verified this 2 times, with TWO SUPERVISORS, but unfortunately they cannot move me to another room with 2 queens and ""kick someone else out of their room "". Umm am I the only one here, who realizes, I WAS KICKED OUT of MY Room!? I ask to speak to one of the 2 supervisors I had verified this with. Get this. No manager or supervisor would be working, the ENTIRE Holiday Weekend! Can you believe it? A 4 star resort with NO Managers or Supervisors on the 4th of July Weekend? Ya, me neither. At this point I am almost in tears I am so frustrated. I thank him, for absolutely nothing, and hang up. nAfter closer inspection of the room, it was noted that there were ants, everywhere, in the kitchen. Guess we won't be leaving any food open, lol. I call back, advise the first person to answer, tell them there are ants, they'll take care of it. Obviously after we left, because no one ever showed. nThe BED was comfy, the pull out bed was like sleeping on straight bed frame. The pillows are so ""feathered "" they provide absolutely no support. Our balcony had a HORRIBLE lean to it, it was actually kind of freaky. Overall the hotel room was just dark, felt old, and not at all what I expected. nThis resort is 100 Smoke Free however you are allowed to smoke ""E CIGS "". So me and my girls brought a couple with us, and used them at the pool while we drank. It was on our second day, we were at the pool, with the ""swim up bar "" and a bar crew member comes up to me and my friend, and advises us a guest is complain that we're smoking the E CIGS. I tell the young bartender, that they are allowed, and the guest can complain all they want. What he should have done is informed the guest that they're allowed. I don't like being told that I can't do something, that is obviously OK. He told a second gentleman a few chairs down from us the same thing, that didn't go over nearly as well. The kid was basically told to shove it, felt kind of bad for him, but hey, think before you speak! We ate at Rico's on Saturday night, they had live music, which was great. The food was fantastic, we all enjoyed ourselves, and our drinks . nI can honestly say we had a great time, we made the best of it. But I have had better customer service at a Days Inn off of I10. I will NEVER go back to this resort, and would never, ever recommend it. It is a waste of money. Go some where else!",1
Loved this place ! Needed to find a new sushi restaurant in the neighborhood. It seems that they all start off good and slowly go downhill. The chefs here created all sorts of items that were not on the menu. Love that ! Now that I'm writing this . I'm craving sushi again ! Looks like another visit to Sasa Sushi is coming soon !,2
"Sigh. The whole thing was non optimum. Vegas has so many great restaurants. There doesn't seem to be any excuse for poor performances. n nThe Mongolian beef was inedible, the charge for a cut roll or hand roll was the same, so I ended up paying 9.50 for one spicy tuna hand roll, and the service was poor. The bill ended up being 75 for mediocre food, it was just disappointing. n nChoose something else. There are just so many great choices in Vegas. Go for something with a few more stars.",1
"First and possibly last time I ever eat here. Umm tip, CHECK YOUR CHICKEN. In a rush, I came in for the first time to teriyaki boy right after working out at LVAC. I asked for dark chicken, w rice n veggies. Order came up rather quickly. BONUS points right? Upon looking at the chicken further, I'm noticing it wasn't grilled or anything, just looks like plain chicken. Then I'm thinking, did they microwave this, how did they cook it? Chicken came to me a little pale looking rather cooked. I take my first bite, not bad. Upon completing half the bowl I notice a few pieces that were not cooked. I brought it to their attention, they asked if I wanted something else. I said ""no "" due to the fact they might give me more undercooked microwaves chicken. n nI'm betting that if I DIDN'T ask for sauce on the did I wouldn't have noticed it. So for future reference CHECK your chicken.",1
"This place is what you except with some awesome decor! I will say it is quiet and far enough away from the casino that you can actually relax at a meal with out all the hustle and bustle. The menu was some what limited but everything we ordered was good! We ordered breakfast and a Philly cheese steak. I think Id order this again! The service was average, took a good amount of time to get refills but other than that Id recommend it.",2
I love Filibertos but wont gobhere again! I love a good burrito gut buster but added non food items could be downright dangerous!,1
"My sister had her wedding reception here on Friday night and we could not have asked for a better experience! The staff was excellent and the food was delicious! Brittany, the event coordinator was fabulous and attentive. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to hold an event. The staff was AWESOME! I will tell everyone I know that this is the best place in town for events! Thanks to all the staff for your help! My sister's wedding reception was PERFECT! Alex",2
This is another very good Charlotte Library. The wireless connectivity is quite good. The collection of music and movies is very good. South Regional might be a little better This is an oasis in the commercial wasteland that is Southpark.,2
"We've shopped here for many years in the past but rarely anymore, they are getting too expensive compared to other Japanese Korean markets in Vegas. Curious how they could stay in business.",1
"I get better service at the DMV n n nI travel for a living and have stayed in hundreds of hotels because of work and by far this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. My wife and I came to Vegas for a fun time so we decided to stay here. First of all we felt like we were staying at the ""Jersey Shores "". If that is your crowd then you will really like it a lot. When we checked in they said they upgraded us to the Paradise Tower with a pool view. We asked for a mountainside view when we made reservations but were told that it wouldn't be too loud and were assured that we would really like the poolside view upgrade. BAD idea! When we got to our room the music from the pool was going and all the speakers face the Paradise Tower and because it's so loud it literally vibrates the windows. Honestly plan on never sleeping if you get a poolside view room. As a heads up the d u00e9cor in the Paradise Tower is so dark the rooms are dark and it shows dirt really easily. We had so many problems that we called guest services from the hotel phone. We let the phone ring for 30 minutes for someone to answer. When they finally did they sounded annoyed. We asked if they had any other rooms but they said they were full and wouldn't allow us to change rooms. That didn't seem right so after I hung up I called the reservation desk from my cell phone. When I did they said they had plenty of rooms in the hotel and I could get a room without a poolside view. So I called back and again no one answered or picked up for 15 minutes. I ended up calling the main number on the website and they picked up right away. So if you ever stay here NEVER call the guest service number from your hotel room but call the number on the website with your cell phone and they will pick right up. nAfter two days of not sleeping because from the music from the pool and the music from the pool area from the concert at the pool at night plus the guests next to us who brought their own sound system and blasted music all night we had enough and demanded a room change. When we asked they said they were full but I told them we had just called reservation and were told they had plenty of rooms they finally admitted they had rooms and they moved us. We ended up getting moved to the HRH tower and what a difference. The rooms are bright, big and the windows don't vibrate all day from music. IF you want a quiet peaceful room the HRH tower is it. It is more expensive but SO worth it. nAs for the pool because the pool has limited pool chairs I had to go down at 8 am every morning and put towels down on chairs to save them because if not it fills up fast and you won't get a lounge chairs. If you want to pay for poolside bed or cabana that is another option but for the free lounge chairs get down early and save your chairs in advance. nAs far as the service from the staff something is coming from management because I have never been this badly treated. I get treated better from the DMV then from people that work at the Hard Rock Hotel. Overall I give this place a 0 but the lowest score I could score it was a 1. We will never stay here again and in talking with a lot of other guests they feel the same way.",1
Only came here because Naked Pizza was 21 and over. I am glad we did. Pizza was excellent.,2
This place might just have the best lunch sandwiches ever! Friendly and accommodating to special dietary requests. I also love that they use quality ingredients. I will be back.,2
"I couldn't have asked for a better experience! My bike had been sitting dormant for a few years and I've made the decision to start riding again. Chris tuned up the bike and installed new tires, super quick service and reasonable prices. Two thumbs up for the Bike Doctor!",2
"I use to go here quite often when they first opened, and it was pretty good. But is now so bad that I no longer go. The cooks are dirty, sushi is sloppy and ingredients are not well chilled, and the chicken terriyaki is made with some interesting meat. With so many other options in this plaza, they really need to improve asap to survive!",1
"I cannot fully describe how happy this place makes me. I am a theater geek and have been dying for a real theater in Vegas ever since I moved here. This is not like the many theaters on the Strip that cut a show down to a 60 90 minute version of itself just so everyone can be herded back to the slot machines. The Smith Center is finally here, it's built for us locals, and it has so many great programs to offer. n nThis review is for Reynolds Hall. n nI was here for the first concert Bela Fleck, not the super expensive gala and I have to say this place is amazing. There is gorgeous marble everywhere, beautiful lighting, stunning architecture, and all within an Art Deco theme. Step inside The Smith Center and you will feel transported to 1928 in New York City. n nDespite having four yes, four balconies, the elevators are surprisingly easy to deal with. I did leave during the encore so perhaps that helped with the wait time. The balconies are small and intimate and you can easily see over the people in front of you. I was sitting in the Gallery or 3rd balcony and the seats weren't as bad as I imagined they would be. A smidge higher than I would have liked but certainly not a bad view like you would picture for a third balcony. I would try to get tickets in the section below Dress Circle if you can. n nThe bathrooms are large and there wasn't too long of a wait time. Try to wait a few minutes after intermission begins to avoid the lines. The lines for the bar, however, are long throughout the entire intermission. There were two small bars in the Upper Lobby right outside of the Gallery and I didn't even bother to try to get anything. I didn't see any pricing for the alcohol. n nSpeaking of the Upper Lobby, there is a beautiful view from the terrace that is located on this floor. You can view Symphony Park the outdoor venue just below and downtown Las Vegas is to the right. The beautiful view will be marred by smokers however, so unless that's your thing don't expect to stay out here for too long. n nThe acoustics at Reynolds Hall are one word outstanding. Even though we were high up in the Gallery, we still heard everything as though we were sitting a few rows back from the stage. It doesn't get any better than this. n nI have dreamt of a place like The Smith Center for the few years I've lived in Vegas and I have to thank everyone that contributed in any way. You have provided us not only with a performance arts theater but a beautiful building for the downtown area, a learning space for the children of Vegas, a gathering place for friends and families, inspiration from the performances, architecture and art at your theater, and a sense that this town is finally starting to care for its own. Las Vegas is grateful.",2
"A favorite of mine to eat at when I go to Pittsburgh. Italian food, a small bar when you walk in, tables to the room to your right more tables in the back, nice atmosphere. great food. r nUPDATE Abruzzi's has moved into the Day's Inn I believe, and I have yet to visit it at it's new location.",2
"The 20.13 3 course lunch was amazing. The fish lovraki, salmon, lobster pasta was all cooked to perfection. The octopus was amazing, never had such tender octopus. The bread to dip in olive oil was so good, crunchy crust. Real rustic bread. n nI have nothing bad to say about this restaurant including the service. All 5 stars. n nThe yogurt martini dessert was a perfect ending. I didn't think I was gonna get full from the pictures i saw but I did. n n Tips n n1. lunch starts at 12pm ends at 2 30pm you need to get in by 2pm. They shut the restaurant between end of lunch and dinner. Business casual dress n n2. reservation is not needed for lunch but I recommend it, as its getting popular for their lunch special. n n3. Even tho their lunch special for 3 courses is 20.13, some of the items are supplemental meaning you need to pay extra. The octopus everyone is raving about is 10 more on top of the 20.13, and the lobster pasta is 15 more. The extra price is well worth is. n n4. In my opinion the Greek yogurt martini is the best dessert unless you don't like yogurt, I was told its made in house. Its very rich and creamy. The thickest yogurt I've ever had. Slight tang with a touch of sweetness. n nI payed 120 for 3 people for lunch. That included the octopus appetizer and the lobster pasta that we had to pay extra for.",2
"Yay to a delicious easy eat in Vegas! Forget the Vegas buffets and michelin star promises of fine dining after all that drinking and partying, what you really want is a hearty meal that will hit the spot. Thank god for Earl of Sandwich! n nNothing fancy, but I promise the 5.99 sandwiches are just what the doctor ordered. We tried several in the group, the best was the tuna melt followed by the Montague. Despite the line, it's really a short wait. Sandwiches come out piping hot and seating was not difficult to find.

"I followed Michelle King here from the disaster of Urban Hair, where the receptionist effed up my appointment twice and aggravated my nerves with her fake nice bullshit. The staff at R Salon are great and of course, Michelle is the shit. n nIf you have short hair and are looking for something edgy and fashion forward, get Michelle to do your 'do. Seriously. She's phenomenal. She knows the industry and her styles cuts colors prove this. She's flexible in her times and reasonable in her prices. I am a prick when it comes to my hair, but Michelle turns it out every time. n nAlso.R Salon has those DELISH! sourdough pretzels and RED VINES candy at the front desk for the customers, as well as refreshments that I can't help but indulge in every time I'm there.",2
"Venetian, five girls, one room, one shower no reservation for dinner and a very, very hungry Lia. n nAfter arriving late to our already last minute reservation Picasso was kind enough to still seat us and we ended up dining next to several authentic Picassos in a place overflowing with elegance. Being the grandma that I am I was terribly happy to be sitting next to a 90 year old couple and a group of women in their 70s all dressed up for a night out so cute! The impeccable service at Picasso was worth every penny of the 150 share of my bill. Be forewarned, it is of course a prix fix menu of either 113 for something like 3 courses or 150 for 5 i forget . They were even courteous enough to offer some of my friends 50 entrees instead since we weren't told about the prix fix menu. n nWe began with a cr u00e8me of carrot and ginger soup which was immensely refreshing and compliments of the chef. I continued with the warm quail salad with saut u00e9ed artichokes and pinenuts. I've also heard their ragout of seasonal vegetables with fresh foie gras and jus de poularde is incredible so if your a fan of foie gras, part of me feels like this is where it might be just as good as paris. I then continued with the venison on a bed of risotto rice which is not game y at all and very delightful. Surprisingly I forget what I had for dessert but I know it was delicious. I think it was a chocolate souffle. They also brought out a tray of chocolate treats for the table. n nI'm very big on the small details and Picasso was attentive to every one of them. They weren't rude at all when we took too much time ordering, were the last people to stay until closing, or when our inappropriate comments were heard over the quiet chatter of the dining room. n nIf you're planning on venturing here make sure you come to spend a lot of money, definitely get the wine the sommelier recommends, he was incredible , and grab a seat on the patio if its warm or by the window to see the bellagio watershow if its chilly. n nBon Apetit!",2
"I brought my good friend here to find out about flowers for her upcoming wedding. I live in the area and am a big fan of supporting local businesses. We walked in the door and there were boxes everywhere! I thought we had accidentally went into a warehouse. No employees in sight! Just as we were ready to walk back out the door a woman approached us. The ""show room "" was so much like a warehouse that I asked if we were in the right place for wedding flowers. She gave me a short yes. Mind you there is not one flower in sight. I asked her to educate us on buying flowers for an upcoming wedding. With a Chloe purse full of Scottsdale attitude right here in my beloved non snobish neighborhood, she responded with ""Well am I going to sell you flowers or are you here to copy what we do and make it yourself? "" n nWhoa. WTF are you kidding me?! Listen lady have you ever heard of this thing called the internet? If we wanted to do flowers our self we can read all about that from the comfort of our houses in our PJ's and not waste time talking with you and your tude! n nAfter defending our intentions she sat down with us to talk flowers. She showed us pictures and gave some nice suggestions upgrading this review from a one star to a two. I could see from her note pad on the table that they do some huge money events and from the pictures I saw it looks like they do a nice job. n nBottom line it's not my call where the bride buys her flowers, but if it were up to me I would move on to somewhere with a high standard for service in addition to high standards for flowers. I personally would not return or recommend them, unless you like to be treated like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman on her first trip to Rodeo Drive. ""Big mistake. Big. Huge. """,1
"I cannot believe this place is called Joe's stone crab just like the one in Miami ? It has absolutely nothing to do with the original one, I have been more than 30 times to the original in miami and the only thing I can say is that the one in las vegas is horrible in every way, for example In vegas the clam chowder was not only cold but we had to return it because it tasted like dirty laundry, then we ordered the wedge salad where in miami they bring you a huge portion witch most of times you have to share because it is so big, in vegas they brought me a 1 3 of a half, i returned it telling them that there most be a mistake on the portion, 10 minutes later they brought me the exact same portion telling me that in vegas is a different portion, then we ordered the stone crabs, incredibly they didn't had the most common size witch is the large and told us that they only had the jumbos that were priced about 85dls per order, 20 minutes later another person came and told me that they had ran out of the jumbo's but now suddenly they had the large ! so we ordered the large, it was not surprised that when the stone crabs came they were frozen and not good at all, a fresh stone crab should not stick to the shell and this ones were a disgrace for what they charge, the sweet potato fries are completely different as well, and the signature key lime pie is also not made the same way and tasted nothing like the original. If you plan to go to Joe's Do not consider by any means to go to the one in Vegas, It has nothing to do with the original in Miami, I keep asking me why would they change a great menu like the one in Miami to make a worst one? please some one tell me ! they should be ashamed to be called Joes stone crab.",1
Had coffee there several times when an old friend used to study there daily. I thought the coffee was average at best. n nYou can get a decent milk based coffee drink anywhere and they have no clue how to make espresso almost one one does so this is no surprise .,1
"Took my mom here for dinner. She had the Thai Chicken Salad, and loved it. The ginger dressing was amazing. I had the Jambalaya, came with garlic bread. Very good, not too spicy and tons of shrimp and sausage. We shared a creme brulee for dessert, AMAZING! it was sooo good. The service was quick, friendly, and everything was great. I love the atmosphere at this restaurant. never had a bad meal or bad service here.",2
"I was here with a big GROUP and i do not know how People give this place more than 2 stars! The meat was overcooked, service slow and the place very rundown. Usually the reviews are spot on but this place was a complete miss!",1

"We've used Eco Fresh twice now and would definitely recommend this company to friends and family. We moved to a new place where the carpets were covered in dog hair and odor, but Eco Fresh was able to clean it all out. The carpets are a million times cleaner and brighter! Luigi who did our carpets both times was very friendly and gave us great customer service too. Thanks again!",2
We had to come try this place out since it had amazing reviews. We were disappointed TWICE!.The service was great both times. We had carryout the first time and ate in the second. The place was busy both times and the Chicken wings were the only thing that was consistently good. The Collard Greens are the toughest and tasteless greens I've ever had and the Mac Cheese is so so. My Husband had the fried whiting and it was tasty but he also didn't like the sides and said the greens were gritty. We both agree that the cornbread is delicious. I would return for the Chicken Wings only.,1
If you are stuck in a High End resort hotel you would hope to get excellent service and food. Well that is not the case at Carnegie.,1
"As a Las Vegas local I try and stay away from the major hotels, but I'll gladly put up with tourists to eat at Mr. Lucky's. n nThere's a ""secret "" 7 steak, baked potato, and shrimp dinner that I see a lot of people ordering, but I stick to the huevos rancheros or their chinese menu They're both so good! n nIf you're a member of Restaurant.com, Mr.Lucky's is among its featured restaurants, and it makes it extremely inexpensive.",2
"I went here to get realigned a couple of months ago. The staff was very nice and my actual appointment went quite well. When it came time to reschedule for a follow up appointment, I was thoroughly disappointed. I scheduled the second appointment the day I went in to see them. Days later, I received an email asking to reschedule because the doctor was out sick. No big deal, I replied to the email to set another time. A little after that, I got a phone call confirming my appointment for the time I was just asked to reschedule. I called the office and the person who answered seemed baffled. This exact thing happened again with my second rescheduled appointment. After that experience, I had a lack of confidence in the office and have not gone back.",1
"It's a supermarket like there are so many. Being located in Vegas you're directly confronted with the gambling machines. Strange. Even off strip. But hey, this is Vegas. n nWe visite this location during all our stays in the past years and don't know if I'm right or not, but seems that the neigbourhood is changing. And not in a good way. And that reflects on the supermarket and the people hanging around in, and in the neigbourhood if this location. I'm no longer very comfortable with visiting here in the dark. And don't like people following me and making all kinds of remarks about my appearance and keep asking me where I'm from and how it's like there. I was so happy there's security walking around. But this being necessary says it all. n nBesides that they have everything you need. Even a not too bad bakery. Only the pre packed fresh fruits are often sold out and the service is slow. n nAnd excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes. English is not my first language.

"The line was empty at the drive thru, yet the cashier had this pushy, rushed tone to her voice. I asked for an order of fries and a sprite. Once I got to the window, she took extra long to get to me even though there were no cars in front or behind me. I'll assume it was because she was taking great care with my order. Once I gave her my card she gave me my food, I collected my card, and I left. When I exited I looked to see if perhaps there was a car who was giving a long order and no no one was there. Oh well. It's fast food after all.",1
"I have visited both the Tempe and old town locations and I really enjoy both for their unique vibes, but the old town location is a little more open and has a great patio to enjoy. I have tried several of the pasties but my favorites are the more traditional ones, especially the chicken pot pie pasty just a perfect, flaky crust and rich, saucy fillings that warm you to the core. n nSpeaking of warming you to the core, get yourself a cup of the leek soup it's so underrated and you won't even believe it. Spread some butter on the house made bread, dip it in the soup and you've got yourself a little piece of heaven. n nAlways great British beers and ales on tap too one of my favorite restaurants to bring visitors to in the valley.",2
"So im sitting in my room at Harrahs yelping away, trying to find places to eat. and behold a oyster bar? what? heaven has spoken to me. n nso after watching phantom of the opera we decided to go back and try the oyster bar. since i love oysters my bf not so much. lol he wasn't really excited to go but he did it for me. walking in no body greeted us so we sat ourselves. someone came to get or order he was pleasant enough it was kinda busy so we understood the long pauses in between. what we ordered n n1 2 dozen fresh oysters kinda small but really fresh it was really good only own side i kept getting shell in my mouth like a lot of shell. i love eating it with a splash of lemon, a dash of tabasco and a dollop of cocktail sauce with extra horseradish n n1 2 dozen oyster rockafeller my first time having it, it had a nice flavor but it was kinda overwhelming it has a nice garlic flavor and topped with spinach and some type of cheese it was a little too much tho i do think i could have ate a full dozen add a little splash of lemon to cut the heaviness n ncalamari crunchy pieces. i love how they includes the tentacles that my favorite part topped with lemon, my bf preferred the marinara i just used my yummy cocktail sauce. but it did come with a good aoili sauce as well n nfish tacos I didn't personally try it so i cant say much but my bf love it. only down part was there was too much sauce on the taco. n nall in all if I'm back in vegas I'm defiantly coming back. btw the bus boy was the niceest of them all like he was like asian and had a ponytail he was so nice.!",2
"We LOVED our stay at Gas Light Inn. The beds are SO comfy, really nice clean rooms, nice furniture, and TVs too. Upon walking in we were greeted by the very friendly owners who made us feel right at home. We relaxed in their awesome little wine bar over a nice glass of vino the owners know their stuff on wine and enjoyed the live entertainment.

"I'll start by saying the store is a complete zoo. Avoid nights and weekends, if possible. n nI made an appointment online and checked in when I got there. After waiting 40 minutes past my appointment, I asked if I was close to the top of the list. The lady said I was almost next, so be patient and someone will come over. n nIt wasn't clear who was going to help me or how many people were waiting, but eventually about 50 minutes after my appointment time Darnell came up and checked out my phone. I was having trouble with the battery and needed a few accessories. He ran a utility that showed how robust my battery was showed me the little graph. After reviewing that my battery wasn't great, but also not terrible, he recommended I hold off on the 85 battery replacement and wait for my next upgrade. n nDarnell provided some awesome advice, but I felt like I had to beg for any kind of help. Why do they use the appointment system if you end up waiting anyway?",1
"I'm already a fan of eeZ, and the Cowfish is eeZ younger cousin, so I knew I would like it. I also knew I would like it because it's the best of me and my girlfriend's world b c she loves sushi and I love burgers and milkshakes. The ambiance and the atmosphere is very chilled and laid back. The Rangoon Crab Dip appetizer is to absolutely die for.when we order this and it's a large group, I usually just order like 2 or 3 of these b c I usually down one by myself. I think I had the best burger I ever had in my life, the C.B.C.L.T.I can't even put it in words. The service is always great, but the only reason I can not give it 5 stars is because it is always too packed, waiting for a table can take up to an hour, this location doesn't take reservations due to it's popularity, and last but not least, the Southpark snobs that frequent this place get to me sometimes with their ""my s doesn't stink "" attitudes they like to dish out. Besides those extremely minor things, this is a great restaurant.4 stars",2
"I was here last night after the bars closed in Old Town. I was thrilled to know there's a place to grab food late besides typical fast food and Philadelphia Sandwich is open 24 hours!. n nThis place is yummy. I had a cheesesteak with onion rings and it was really good and I wasn't drunk so my tastebuds were operating under fairly normal conditions . n nThere were a ton of people milling inside so I figured it would take some time to get my food nope, I waited maybe 5 minutes. n nThe food itself was great, I doubt you'd be disappointed with anything on the menu. It all looked good. I'll go back next time I'm in Old Town and craving a cheesesteak. The onion rings were okay I'd still order them again but Corleones has THE BEST onion rings in my opinion so there's some tough competition. Hmmm.there is just something about the way cheeseteaks and onion rings go together. n nOh, and I'm not sure if they do this all the time but they had a DJ playing awesome music SUPER loud. I felt bad for the people sleeping in the surrounding hotels but it was fun for us in the restaurant. Everyone was dancing in the middle of the restaurant so that was an added bonus.",2
"Food is wonderful, the atmosphere perfect, and Alex is a sweet and charming waitress.",2
"Always like coming here. Inside is very clean, very comfy. Staff is always nice. Iced hot Americano is my forte. I can really taste the quality espresso.",2
"Decent sandwich since I am normally a fan or Jimmie johns. However, this location has pretty slow service. Makes me wonder if its new staff on training? Ive been to this location about 6 times now and each time its been about the same. I order either the Beach club or the tuna salad club, both are very delicious. The only other complaint that I have is that my beach club and the hunter club that my friend get are thinner less meat and filling wise then what i am normally used to from other Jimmie Johns.",1
"Always been a favorite but not tonight! Sophie's Salad was underwhelming.brown lettuce and the cheese cubes were hard.it was like the salad was from yesterday.just awful. I was really surprised it was actually served to us. The ahi appetizer was tasteless. The ahi entree was really good. Corn side dish good and crunchy! nAll in all, disappointing .",1
This is a Las Vegas favorite that has been publicized and pretty well overrated. One of the only things really worth having is their sangria beyond that I like their fries and that would be it. Service isn't much to really rave about. It's always packed with annoying college kids and has so much bad rep when it comes to health code violations you will always worry about it every time you go.,1
This place was really disapointing. I had really high hopes the music was good and its a cool atmosphere but the food that we ordered wasn't good. We had lamb stew and shepherds pie. They were both pretty bland.,1
"Good food, very cool interior and great coctails. Very modern and professional atmosphere for meetings, lunch or dinner. Careful. lunch for 2 with an appetizer, main course, a couple of soft drinks and gratuity will run around 50 60. The rooftop patio is the coolest in Phoenix with daytime views of Piestawa Peak and the Biltmore Shopping Center and nighttime views of the hustle and bustle of Camelback Road and the Biltmore Shopping Center.",2
"Really great pizza right across the street from the Hard Rock, which is great for a quick bite after a concert or to line the stomach for a night of drinking By the slice or pie with crazy combos and names. Totally cheap, great for the baller on a budget!",2
"The absolute standout has to be the cromesquis. I've thought it would be good some time to go sit at the bar and drink, having one or two of them with each drink, and just watch the action in the kitchen, but so far when I've gone to the bar I haven't been able to limit myself just to this. n nAlmost everything I've had has lived up to billing guniea hen for two, duck in a can, bison tongue, plogue champlain, the namesake pied de cochon, crispy PDC salad, guniea hen liver pate, venison liver, and an autumn special once, a small bird can't remember exactly what kind cooked in a small pumpkin in soup, artistically presented with the talons sticking out where the lid had been cut out. n nMy one disappointment make me not a fan of the fois gras poutine. It just doesn't come together at all, too disjointed. Also the combinatorics just don't work there aren't enough fries, you just can't get the right ratios of everything together. n nAlso be careful not to get too many dishes that are meat or poultry with the same seasonings on the same mashed potatoes with veggies. The servers are good and I think would make sure you didn't make that mistake, but better for you to look out for yourself. Jasmine's review indicates that you do need to watch out for this yourself every time I've been, the server has discussed the combinations we've proposed with us, so ymmv. n nBut overall, APDC lives up to the hype, in my experience. The staff, at least on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, always seem to be enjoying their work and each other, and have always been really friendly.",2
"I gave it two stars because of the waitstaff and food, otherwise it would have been one star or less. n nI went in with a large wedding party 24 and we were treated like crap by the hostesses and the manager. We were split up at three different tables and separated from each other. Then we were lied to about why we could not sit at the multiple open tables next to one another. They did not care to try and accommodate us even with us making reservations days prior. n nThe manager was obviously on an unnecessary power trip and she did not need to display the attitude she did. A separate manager, Sam, was very apologetic and wanted to make it right when I spoke with him later. However, the damage had been done and it left too bad of taste in all of our mouths. None of us will return solely due to the way we were treated by the frontline staff. n nWith that being said, the waiter was amazing and it was obvious he understood our frustration. He went above and beyond helpful to try and make us feel welcome. In addition, the food was very good.",1
"Loved my dogs groom here. They did such a good job on her and put an adorable bandana on her after. Groom was excellent and this will be where I take her in the future for that. n nI have done a couple daycares and my dog seems to enjoy it. I don't love that the outside area is rock and that is my biggest complaint about the place but I still like it here. I like that they are in small groups indoors but I wish they had a little more space indoors. I almost feel like they are crated, even tho they have someone to play with. n nThe staff is super friendly and I really like the owner. I think overall this is a great place to take your dog, clean, friendly, and safe which is most important. There are some areas that I think could improve, but overall I'm very happy with this place so far. I've struggled finding good dog daycares.",2
"We eat at nice places quite frequently but this is the best service we've had in Phoenix. From the moment they opened the door for us when we walked everyone from the hostess to the server to the busser was pleasant and attentive. And the most important thing the food definitely matches the service. It is absolutely delicious! The crab cakes are some of the best we've had, and meals are served with wonderful pretzel bread.",2
"Had bad service and bad shrimp. Can't comeback from serving bad shrimp or should I say prawns. If it was good,3 stars at the most.",1
"My first time at O.H.S.O. and it was a good experience. We had the beer brunch, which was a great deal with delicious food. The biscuits and gravy were great. The atmosphere is fun and the patio is superb. n nMy only negative was the service. Our waitress didn't seem to know much about the menu and told us one price for a side and then charged us more. She also didn't ask how we wanted our eggs cooked, so my partner wasn't keen on the scrambled. Oh well, nothing awful, but definitely not a bonus for the place. n nI will definitely be back and come for brunch, just will look for a different server.",2
"Bella Vista apartments are superb in terms of the renovations to make them even more attractive than before. Management is above and beyond in terms of meeting reasonable expectations of your every day citizen. The men who see to repairs are timely in response and do not leave until a problem is resolved. They cannot fix something which is not actually a problem related to the product being serviced but is the user's fault. n nI have lived here for over a year and am handicapped. Management is extremely helpful in every way possible to make this complex a home for its residents. I have never heard water running above me. Yes, I can hear them walking, but it is an apartment, not a private residence. n nYes, it is a gated community which is a huge benefit to all who live here. It is not as if anyone complaining about it now was not aware of it when the first drove up and signed the paperwork to live here. n nAs stated earlier, the men who provide maintenance services have always responded in a timely manner and have fixed whatever the problem was. They have been very polite and have offered assistance above and beyond the basics. They cannot fix the inability of an individual who is perhaps at fault due to insufficient experience with equipment. n nAgain, management at this facility is superb in meeting the needs of residents.",2

"So I get to the door to be seated at 10 30 the hostess said that they weren't taking anymore tables to dine in and suggest I go to their Togo window outside so me and my boyfriend are waiting in like for about 10 min and some guy comes out telling half the line that they aren't taking anymore Togo orders because it will be after 11 00 the time everyone orders. So I'm pissed because I just paid 10 to valet my car and I rushed to be there by 11 00 the time they supposedly closed at so I ask the guy why is it that we just been wasting our time standing there for nothing and then point to some random guy in line and says he's holding the sign. Oh!? So the sign that a CUSTOMER who GETS his food is responsible for holding a sign that says he is the last person in line to order. Wow makes pretty good sense seeing as how NO ONE SAW THE SIGN! Because there were 10 people behind that guy! I seriously can't believe this! If you close at 11 00 and don't want to make food until 11 00 then make your closing time the actual time you stop seating and serving Take out at the special ""take out "" window outside!",1
"I'm rating off my one experience here, which was only a quick trip to go on the roller coaster. So. Much. Fun. There are signs directing you to the roller coaster, which is helpful. I went with a small group of people pretty late Saturday night I think it was around 11. There are lockers to store your things purses, bags, etc. that cost .50 to use. They have them at the end of the line and there are a few at the platform to use if you've neglected to put your stuff away before getting in line. The roller coaster was quite entertaining. I especially loved that we went at night, so we got to see all the city lights flying by although I had to take my glasses off, so everything was pretty blurry . I haven't been on a roller coaster in years 2006 was the last time, I believe , so this was a great time. Thrilling enough to keep me entertained but not scary enough to make me swear off roller coasters.",2
Pumi's ok. The greeter was cool. I think he was the chef. I didn't like the dark ambiance. Service was not that great. Was a lil slow than usual. Food portion was not as gd as Sushi Bay. I prefer Sushi Bay.,1
I have been corrected. The water slide is actually three stories according to a popular traveler magazine that rhymes with Rhonda Mast.,2
"Unfortunately, I was not impressed with this restaurant. The menu was not very appealing, the food we did order was just okay, and the service wasn't anything to write home about. If you want to enjoy some Mexican fare, this would not be my first choice.",1
We finally had Brunch at Postino's East and it was amazing! We shard the Farmhouse Scramble and the French Toast. n nThe scramble was perfectly cooked the potatoes flavorful and the gruyere was the perfect cheese. The side salad and tomatoes were the perfect accompaniment. n nThe french toast was by far the best restaurant french toast I've eaten in a LONG time. I make my own french toast that my husband and I both drool over but Postino's has definitely mastered their french toast dish. The creme fresh with sliced almonds and the fresh fruit compote.need I say more?,2
Just had a bikini and eyebrow wax with Carla. She was great and SUPER fast which is exactly how I like it . She was extremely through and did a really good job. Wish she was my local gal but we were just passing through on vacation.,2
"This is one of the few places that is actually ran by people that speak and can cook a decent Japanese meal. The fish is very fresh and they have real Wasabi, not the fake tube crap they all other places serve. So when you mix it in, hold on to your taste buds. The ramen is also a nice treat. The service is very prompt and highly friendly. The only thing that I am sure will be fixed shortly is that they don't have their liquor license. Otherwise I would give them 5 stars. I do miss my sake.",2
"We had dinner on a Friday night at around 8 00. The place cleared out by 8 30 and we felt seriously rushed by the staff to finishing our dinner and drinks. Pretty early for this on a weekend night guess they had places to go. n nAs far as the food is concerned, for an ""Italian "" restaurant, it was just mediocre the pizza crust was dry, sauce was OK the chicken piccata wasn't bad but also not great. We were looking forward to an excellent meal, especially the pizza, considering this is owned by Tomaso, but were obviously disappointed. Not worth the time, money, or calories! n There are so many better Italian restaurants in town, so we won't be back to this one.",1
"The food isn't as great as the buffet at Wicked Spoon or Bellagio's.I bought a travelzoo deal and yea it's for two people and you get 2 wines, but still.the food is eh and not very great in quality. I do like how they have a sugar free dessert bar, but the ice cream was super watery that it melts once it's inside your bowl. The Chinese food pretty much sucked.the crabs weren't bad, I suppose the only thing I liked was the cauliflower and the pork siu mai.lots of salad selection though, so if you're into salad, sure why not. n nI def wouldn't recommend this place nor would I ever want to go back. A bit of a disappointment and the line was a bit long and confusing because I wasn't sure where the line even started.",1
"Went here a few times and thought was a decent breakfast spot not great but pretty good . This past time, our server was rude, the manager had attitude with us when a meal did not come with toast that was supposed to and we requested it, one meal was cold they did replace and take off the bill and a meal I had previously enjoyed was bad as well. Wont go again. Would rather head to Poppy's or Zada Janes.",1
"Just about as good as it gets, but their prices are getting a little steep. 2.79 for fish taco 2.99 fish especial I can understand but 1.99 for those teeny weeny street tacos so delicious to my taste buds? We calculated and it's .66 per bite 'cuz you only get 3 per taco. Good thing they frequently have coupons for their email beach club and always a free meal for your birthday, what a GREAT bonus, I love that! PS make the lobster burrito a permanent fixture, will ya? And get a stupid kids meal toy for my bratty kid, she's tired of just crayons. Just kidding. ",2
"so I've been a couple of time for drinks, but have never been blown away. we opted to check out the live jazz and reverse happy hour last night and man was I a happy camper. They had a big menu with super cheap food. I went for the macaroni and cheese with Schreiner's Beer Hots, which came baked in a little cast iron skillet. it was pretty dope. It def needed more bechemel sauce but it was good. We also ordered the wings, and man were they hot as hell! I had a basil mojito, which was also awesome. The band who was playing was really awesome. Overall, cool place to have a few late night bites and a few drinks.",2
"In sum, the concept is outdated an endless list of menu items which means much is frozen and few are prepared properly which is obvious in the bland, dry flavorings. Too expensive for the end result. n nI typically will not dine at restaurants that choose the novel style menus. There is a reason Michelin star restaurants have small menus they can consistently prepare and serve quality menu items each and every time. Its a string of arrogance to have a lengthy menu. No restaurant, especially in Pittsburgh can keep rare ingredients, in stock that are not frozen to provide them in a fresh and edible manner. Which means one is shelling out 25 30 dollars a dish for frozen entrees. The appeal to this is unknown to me. Nevertheless, I purchased the living social coupon and I wanted to be proven wrong sadly I was not. n nThe bread, an overlooked detail at many establishments was not overlooked here. The bread was chewy, fresh, and crispy quite a delightful start to any good dining experience. For starters, I picked the polvo a marisqueira. Grilled octopus with Portuguese blue cheese. Fabulous! The octopus was simply amazing. Even better than the fresh bread. The creamy melted blue cheese complemented the grilled dense and succulent octopus. The price tag may make ones' head spin at 16 . Ho wever, it was worth the one time splurge. Food reviewers have suggested the price is due to importing in the specific type of octopus and Portuguese blue cheese. Fair enough, it was delicious and worth trying at least once. n nBrace yourself my friend, that is where the kind words will end. n nThe entrees my husband and I ordered were a catastrophe. In earnest, it is an embarrassment to fine dining. Jared ordered the suckling pig. Hrmp. It tasted like the chef sucked all the delightful fresh juices from the meat and crispiness from the skin by cooking this dish days ago and reheating it to order. Dreadfully dry, bland pork meat smothered in what was likely once crispy, now soggy, exterior that was overly seasoned with pepper. n nI ordered the wild boar. Again, another dish that sat in the fridge for days. The rich game taste was all but absent from this dish. How long does a dish sit in the fridge that even a ""game animal "" taste domesticated? The rice was slightly under al dente which is as disappointing as it was inedible. The positive glimmer of hope was the sauce the boar was braising in.a cannellini bean tomato sauce. It had a rich smokiness flavor with a hint of sweet. Yet, the beans were the downfall. The sauce was bathing the canned beans. Canned beans.really? I can tell a canned bean from a dried one miles away. Not fooling me on this one. Soggy baby food style beans on leg shanks cooked days ago. Such a shame. n nI thought the service was as disappointing as the food. When we were first seated my husband was looking at the wine menu. The waiter asked if he would like anything, my husband replied no and the waiter left. Um, what century did I enter that my opinion matters not? I even tried to raise my hand to get his attention. Nope. No drinks for me. n nMore fun was in store for us. My husband and I sat in our appetizer dirty dishes for at least 20 minutes. Until a waitress from another table removed them only after I started to pile them together for us to have to room on the small 2 top. Fine dining? I think not.",1

"My bride and I recently stayed at and were married at the Golden Nugget. n nWe have mixed feeling about our stay. n nThe service was lacking from check in. Our reservations were screwed up and several individuals in our party, who reserved rooms, were placed in smoking rooms. Even though non smoking rooms were requested. This was unacceptable considering one of our guests was pregnant. n nWe stayed in the Rush tower. The room was ok, but extremely loud at night due to outside music. n nWe dined at the Grotto and it appears there were only three people working hostess, waiter, and a frustrated chef. The waitstaff was nice, but as we sat waiting for service, a chef who was placing chickens on a rotisserie, was dealing with a rotisserie malfunction. It kept making noise. He called maintenance and four men arrived. Amusing that maintenance men out numbered waitstaff . n nMore poor service.At check in we received a coupon book. We tried redeeming a dining coupon buy one get one free and a hotel staffer crudely told us it was not valid. n nHighly disappointed internet service had a fee and the hotel actively has staff trying to sell timeshares. n nThe wedding chapel was intimate and our wedding was handled professionally. The priest did a wonderful job. Following the ceremony, we went for a drink in the lobby. Unfortunately, my bride was carded which caused a problem since wedding dresses are full of pockets.They would not even comp me a diet coke. Slight disappointed the hotel did not even place a split or small gesture in our room. n nThe pool was heated and very nice. It was one of the highlights of our trip. n nI will be looking elsewhere next time we travel to Vegas.",1
"I checked this place out on a Sunday because my normal spot is closed on Sunday's. Bonus right off the bat! Mad House is a small, but funky coffee shop which I LOVE! They have comfy chairs and brightly colored tables. I was greeted by a friendly staff that was ready to take my order. I got my usual large ice coffee with cream and sweet N low. I was very impressed that they asked how many sweet N lows I wanted in my coffee and they put it in for me. I was shocked when they brought me out my coffee, talk about LARGE! It was huge! This is my kinda spot! For 3.19 I had a huge cup of ice coffee! Not to mention this is the same price I pay at Starbucks for the same thing just not as large. n nMad House also had a huge list of delcious sounding sandwiches and some tasty looking pastries that I will have to try on my next visit. I also was shocked at their selection of sugar free flavors for your coffee. n nI can't wait to check this place out again for more coffee and maybe a sandwich. Good job Mad House you totally won me over!",2
"Didn't realize this was here until the other day. It's a nice place store is really super clean and organized and you can find some good sale items. I didn't spend too much time here, but I saw some decent items. Ended up not buying anything, but I will save it for the next trip out here. I can see where people can go nuts in this store.",2
"Lobster was too salty my steak was over cooked, mentioned it to the waiter who offered to send it back but also told me it was cooked to the right temp but last I knew medium rare isn't fully cooked around the edges with a small rare center not all the way through.",1

"ECHO RIG ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN VEGAS! n nMy boyfriend and I happened to walk by this restaurant a few months ago and were intrigued by the fresh meat and butchering demonstrations in the window. We went in and met the butcher chef. Aaron and he was very friendly and informative. He even gave us a personalized crock pot receipe and some fresh ingredients! n nAfter that, we knew we had to go back and try the dining experience. We went back this weekend and there was a 40 minute wait, but it flew by. We enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar downstairs and chatted with the Aaron again while he was breaking down some meat for the evening. n nNow for the food AMAZING! First we started with the sausage and peppers and the portabella fries. Now, I don't like mushrooms but the waitress said we had to try them so we did and they were great! The breadding was light and crunchy and not at all greasy and the dipping sauce complimented them superbly. For entrees my boyfriend had the new coulotte steak and I had the roasted chicken sandwich I know, I know a sandwich at a steak place? But the balsamic onions had me at Hello . For sides we had the cauliflower and fries. The steak was scrumptous, perfect crust with just the right amount of seasoning to let the natural flavor of the meat shine. The cauliflower was unlike any vegetable I have ever had. It was sweet and spicy and all the different flavors popped in my mouth with each bite. A MUST TRY! The sandwich was great too the bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and the onions, arugula and onions merried perfectly with the chicken. n nWe brought in our own wine to take advantage of free corkage so the total bill was only 60! We couldn't belive it. For food that held its own against some of the steak greats like Mastros, Flemmings and Mortons the value was unlike any other. One of the best restaurant experiences in Vegas!",2
"Came here because I wanted a good steak and didn't want to pay Strip prices for it. I shared the Mixed Hot Antipasti a huge plate of fried food , the iceberg wedge and the steak and shrimp scampi, which totally hit the spot to the T. Then we shared two 50 bottles of wine. n nAll in, we paid a little more than 100 a person but the meal was totally delicious and well worth it. My only critique is that service was slooooowwww. Not neglectful, just slow. We were there almost 3 hours. Crazy.",2
Chicken in the shoe is the best dish there. Hands down. No I don't like feet.,2
"I am a Professional Designer and after the way I was treated by one of the ""staff "" members hanging up on me and then after calling back she would not even answer the store phone I was convinced that this person was extremely unprofessional in her job and should not even be working for the Company Garden Ridge which by the way is located in Plano, TX. I called the chief of operations for the corp office and a few others at the top level and let them know about this staff member. I had already spent a 1,000 and was prepared to spend an additional 3,000 to 4,000 today but why should I give a company like this my money with staff treating me like garbage. nForget it I will take my business else where where I get treated like I am the customer and I get some respect and not hung up on. Oh and I called back 4 hours later and the SAME person answered the phone and she put me on hold and never came back. Unreal. I suggest you NEVER CALL if you plan to shop with these idiots. FYI they do have some incredible items IF you go through the junk to find a few jewels. nGreat prices on certain items like Big Mirrors are a steal. Art work very reasonable prices if you need fill in art. nGood luck to you all.",1
"Entrees include a choice of Caesar salad or soup. The Caesar salad here is marginal so we each opted for a cup of minestrone soup which were hearty. We were also served warm rolls plus the always excellent EVOO, roasted garlic and tomato dipping sauce. Our entrees were eggplant Parmesan lightly breaded eggplant, marinara, ricotta and mozzarella. This meal never fails to fills us up so we once again opted to take our free, with fun book coupons received at hotel check in, slices of tiramisu to go.",2
"This is not the best Asian restaurant in AZ as some people have said , but this place IS definitely one of the better Asian FUSION style restaurants around. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. The owner Tottie herself came around and spoke to everyone in the place. n nWe started with salmon satay and the small plate combo for appetizers. Everything was excellent even the presentation with the little hibachi . My brother and I had the curry duck as entrees and we were both very happy with our selections. However, I think I enjoyed eating off my wife's plate of soft shelled crab curry more. My mom had the salmon with basil ginger sauce as she loved it. I'm not exactly sure what my sister had, but it was a seafood plate. She seemed to really enjoy her meal as well. Often times, it can be difficult for a large group of people to eat at the same place and for everyone to enjoy it. Tottie's was the exception. n nA quick note of caution when ordering they make VERY spicy dishes. You can ask them to not make it too spicy, so don't worry. They will provide you with more chili oil if you really need it. n nAs for dessert, Tottie's is one of the few Asian restaurants that have a decent dessert selection. Everyone in my party was too full to eat any including me , but I wanted to see try something out anyway. I ordered the fried honey banana was very happy with it. It wasn't too heavy or too light at the end of my meal plus, it came with some of their non dairy ice cream . They make their ice cream with coconut milk, rather than cow juice. Very nice!",2
"The food's okay for the buffet price, but be prepared for shoddy service, especially if it's busy. Went for the Sunday morning buffet and experienced all of the following n n1 Wait staff seems to be overwhelmed with tables and frequently disappears for long periods of time. n n2 Workers who restock the buffet can barely speak English and when you ask them about a food item that seems to be missing from the buffet they simply tell you that they don't have it and blow you off. They don't even tell you that your waitress might be able to get you that item from the kitchen. n n3 One of the hostesses has a real attitude on her and can barely contain her contempt for the customers. I asked her specifically to find my waitress at one point and she never did. I had to get up and find my waitress myself. n nAll in all this is a very poorly run establishment, which I blame on management for not having enough wait staff onsite during the busy hours, and also for not making sure that the hostesses and buffet workers communicate politely and effectively to the customers. The waitresses seem to be doing their best but they are limited by the disorganization that is caused by management's inability to run a tight ship. I'm sticking with Golden Corral from now on.",1
This place has been amazing for my husband and I so far. Their sushi Chef Sonny was amazing. He knew I loved sashimi style food more so he was really great at suggesting some dishes for us. nTried so many of their special rolls and sashimi from their happy hour menu and their month specials. We will have to go back there for more in the next week or so. nService was also great and couldn't ask for better!,2
"I walked in here for lunch today and I was like ""whoa "". And my co worker was all ""wha? "" And then some random lady was all ""foo ie "" and we were like ""say what? "" And then this old school dude was all ""yo, 'fo shizzle "" so we were all ""table for 7, bra! "" And the host guy was all ""you got it "". So then I was all ""don't be such a barney "". I'm pretty sure he didn't get the reference but that's okay. n nThe food was good. Sampler platter, grubalicous. I went with the 2 meat combo and did the bbq pulled pork and beef brisket even though I'm 110 vegan. If leaves tasted that good, then I probably wouldn't have to stray so often. Love their mac 'n cheese too. I would bathe in it if I could.",2
I really like coming to this Ross versus the other Ross stores around. Everything is organized and clean. The only complaint is I wish it had a bigger jewelry display like the other stores. Every other store I have been too have huge cases of jewelry but this place is tiny. Oh well! Still love how clean and not cramped it is!,2
"Finally, real food close to ASU. First time here and the food is exquisite. I had the ""Sonoran Bean Roasted Veggie Wrap "" with a side of "" Spinach Olive Oregano Pasta. "" The meal was delicious as well as filling. I can see myself spending lots of time on the delightful patio in the future.",2
"I was sad to see that El Picante had closed and been replaced by Taco Tio. But since El Picante was good and I was already here, I figured why not give this new establishment a chance. n nEverything seemed really different inside. I suppose you could say that the decor is actually better now. It's much more authentic Mexican. n nSadly, the counter where you can see everything being made is gone. It is all now back in the back away from customer's eyes, which is definitely disappointing. n nThe menu is fairly simple burritos, tacos, nachos, tamales, and quesadillas. And few options within each of those categories. But hey, sometimes simple is better. n nI went with a burrito wet style and nachos with shredded beef. It was a little disturbing to hear the sound of a microwave in the background never a good sign . And the staff wasn't exactly the friendliest. n nWhen I got my food home yes, take out again , it all looked ok, but while it was edible, everything completely and totally lacked flavor. Yes, devoid of flavor. Literally, I could see the cheese on the chip, but there was zero taste to it. n nMaybe things will improve with time as it seems like this place very recently changed over. However, it would take a lot to get me to go back here.",1

"My mistake! I thought it was a good idea to swing by this Filiberto's and grab some Super Nachos. something quick and easy! The whole visit wasn't quick or easy and the food was meh. after having to wait 20 minutes in the drive through I was HANGRY! Who has to wait 20 minutes in a drive through for food, the point of a drive through is to get your food quick and easy! This Filiberto's definitely doesn't believe in quick. n nAfter becoming quite hangry I finally got my food and drove all the way home. When I got home, my food was cold! Are you kidding me!? We live in AZ no way on my drive home did my food get cold, it was already cold when they gave it to me. The meat was very dry and tasteless! Needless to say I ended up wasting 20 minutes of my time getting my food and ended up throwing it away and cooking something at home! Lets get it together Filibertos!",1
"I don't get out much so when a friend suggested we have a girls night, I immediately thought about checking this place out. I'm a big country fan and the thought of dancing the night away to country music got me really excited. Unfortunately, this place sucked. It was a Friday night and it was crowded. The dance floor is SO SMALL! What kind of country bar has a small dance floor? We literally walked in, walked to the other side, then walked out. My friend perfectly described the atmosphere as a ""college house party "" where it's crowded, you don't really know anybody and you don't know what to do with yourself. All I saw were people standing tightly next to each other, holding a beer and making conversation. Ugh, I came here to dance!",1

"52 bones and 38 muscles, what once were two whole parts of my body are now falling apart into little pieces and I feel every single one of them after a log day at work standing on my feet. I've used and been loyal consumer of every Dr. Scholl's foot product he ever invented that he would probably be upset if he ever finds out I'm putting my feet on someone else hands. but I came to the point that I have to add two more hands on the care of my always tired feet. n I went to the good foot spa looking for Joyce, recommended by a yelper friend, but she doesn't work there any longer so I asked for the second best. Kathy did a wonderful job, I can't say she's the best since this is my first foot massage but anything better than this would have probably been illegal. They have a 30 minute special but I opted for the 45 minute service which at the end given the prep and this and that you really get about 35 minutes of actual massage and even though I was there for the foot massage she started from the top of my head all the way down to my arms and legs covering about 99 percent of my body, missing under the chin if you really have to know while my feet soaked. n It was early in the morning when I went there, I think it was just me and one other person in a different room being slapped around or at least that's what I made out from the sounds and the moans that I could hear clearly since there was no mood music. I didn't want my mind to go wild so I put on my I pod and listened to my own music, Maria Callas to be exact, her screaming was way more relaxing than the guy's next door. nYes, there's a little of that language barrier, but at the end, the massage language is universal, besides I grew up at the barrio and being an expert on sign language came pretty handy for me. I really had a very relaxing experience, my feet felt like new and so did everything else she put her hands on. I was really surprised how great it feels after after a good foot massage. Highly recommended, I'm sure I'll be back, I can get hooked on this. n No more peanut butter on my feet after work.sorry solin. my dog ",2

"From a mezzanine overlooking the Four Queens Casino, Magnolia's offers good food around the clock. I enjoyed breakfast here both mornings during my visit. The portions are generous and delicious.

"We can't all make it over to Venice, but if you can manage to get to The Venetian hotel, you can get a piece of Italy. St. Mark's square was carefully created to replicate the same piazza in Venice, down to the very finest detail! Including a pigeon.which we think came in by accident! . n nThe prices are a bit high, but given the ambience, service, and quality, it's nothing shocking. The menu has a variety of items to satisfy any palette, and a range of prices for those on a budget. n nThe pizzas are delicious and prepared with few, but fresh ingredients. The pasta bolognese is light and flavorful, and the chef is extremely generous with the meat! n nThe wine list is extensive. Not as many Italian wines by the glass, but by the bottle the list is good. n nDefinitely ask for a table out in the piazza for some great people watching, and some nice live music to accompany the meal. The waitstaff is incredibly friendly. Our server was from Italy, so it was fun to chat with him in Italian. And the manager or proprietor not sure what his exact position was came over to check on us, and also offer us free admission to LAVO after. Given customer service is not so great in Vegas, it was nice to be somewhere with pleasant staff!",2
"I read the negative reviews and my exact thoughts were ""Well, some people are jerks and nothing makes them happy. It probably isn't as bad as they say. "" Wrong. Save yourself some money, soak some cardboard in warm water, place it on a warm corn tortilla, and eat it. It isn't that the food tastes bad. It's that it doesn't taste like anything at all. I got a taco platter with three different types of tacos, pork, chicken, and beef. They all tasted exactly the same, like an empty, warm, corn tortilla. The only reason I gave them two stars was for the excellent wait staff. Doesn't make up for the flavorless food. Wouldn't even feed the leftovers to a dog.",1

"As other has mentioned it is a bit pricey, however I don't find it anymore pricey than Nikkos. The shrimp wonton soup is delcious and I enjoy most of their rolls I have tried. Perfect spot to eat at before going out for the night. Wine selection is decent for a sushi bar.",2
"DISAPPOINTING. Let me start by saying we are locals, NOT tourists. So if this was a good experience we may be repeat customers. Yeah, thats not going to happen! After hearing so much hype about this restaurant here in Vegas we decided to give it a try. We went last night, Friday night around 7pm. We expected it to be crowded and expected to have to wait for a table which wasn't a problem. Wait for a table was about 30 minutes, but they were able to get us a spot at the bar sooner so we took that. First mistake, taking the seating at the bar. The two girls or shall I say bimbo's that probably more accurately describes them behind the bar had the personality of a rock! In fact a rock probably had more personality! Unfriendly, rarely even a smile, very slow. After about 10 minutes of sitting there one finally took our drink order. Then our food order. My husband ordered pizza I ordered Veggie meatballs and gluten free pasta. After about 20 minutes my husbands pizza arrived my food was no where in site. Keep in mind the girls to the right of us ordered just before us and they received all their food, and the folks to the left of us ordered just after us and they have all their food. Where is my food. Generally when we go out to eat my husband and I like to EAT TOGETHER! Common sense. After about minutes the bimbo behind the bar says oh your food should be out soon. Really? do ya think I'll get to eat tonight? 10 minutes goes by, still no food for me. Girls to the right and half way done with their meal, same with the folks to the left as well as my husband. Finally we wave down what appears to be a manager. Tall balding man with the rudest attitude EVER! We explained we ordered our food and my husbands food came out nearly 20 minutes ago as well as the folks around us but mine is no where to be found. He said he'd check on it. He went to the back then came back out, wandering around the restaurant as if to ignore us now. Finally after about 5 minutes he comes back and says he doesn't know where my food is! WHAT? I said you don't know where it is? He then says the gluten free pasta takes a while to cook. WHAT?, I ask? I cook gluten free pasta at home all the time and it takes no longer than regular pasta. Oh let me start by saying I ordered the penne pasta which is on the menu but apparently they don't even have so I had to settle for spaghetti. I digress. He said look, I don't know why you are getting upset! REALLY you are a manager and you are saying you don't know why I am upset? Well let me see its been nearly 25 minutes now since my husband got his food and I don't have mine, maybe that is why I'm UPSET ! At this point they should be kissing my butt trying to make up for the lack of service, but NO! Finally my meatballs arrive. Lukewarm! Seriously! Not even HOT! They have just been sitting in the back somewhere for who knows how long! So now I've waited nearly 1 2 hour for lukewarm food. Then about 3 minutes later my pasta shows up, lukewarm as well. Now I will say the Veggie Meatballs were awesome, so complaints about taste, but I'm sure if they were hot they would have been better. My husbands pizza was good also. n nThe problem here is that this restaurant is POORLY RUN! How about getting Gordon Ramsey in to show you how to run a restaurant! Get some knowledgable staff with excellent customer service. Don't bring in the bimbette's just for their looks, that is not going to make this restaurant succeed! Get a manager that is a people person not an old balding, no personality, rude man who hates his job! n nI'm giving this two stars based on the HORRIBLE service. I guess they are not looking for repeat customers, your plan is to cater to the tourists who will most likely never come back again and won't write a poor review. Honestly with well over 3,000 restaurants in this town to choose from, this one WON'T get a second visit from us!",1
"If you're going to eat here, avoid the Double Crunch Shrimp off their 2 for 24 deal. The double crunch really is DOUBLE CRUNCH. They definitely over did the frying on the shrimp along with the fries. Even my boyfriend, who is a avid foodie and is pretty much easily content with any meal, found distaste in his shrimp. n nI ordered the Bourbon Street Steak as I've ordered it many times before at different Applebees restaurants and this time around. It tasted a little too bland for my liking. I was quite disappointed since I really do enjoy this dish. n nOur waitress was okay, but was very awkward when we told her it was our friend's birthday and asked if they did anything special. She said that can give a free dessert in which I agreed to. The dessert came towards the end of the meal, of course, but she was so awkward in delivering it. It was just her and she kind of tried to ""sneak it "" on the table. There was no happy birthday song from her or the staff so me and my friends kind of had to take over from there. I'm sure its different for a kid's birthday though I mean, my friend turned 23 so I guess they don't find the need to sing happy birthday at that age, n nAll in all, this place falls a little below ""alright "" for me. I've had better experiences at other Applebees. I probably won't be back here anytime soon or in the near future.",1
"Went here with some friends at their recommendation. n nMenu was nothing special, but the food was tasty. No alcohol offered, but BYO is OK. Service was fair to OK, but not very attentive once orders were taken. n nOverall, I won't go back here, as there are too many other more appealing places.",1
Simply amazing. Sundays are the best night here! The music is great and the people are hot. Another plus is that it's not crazy packed like marquee.,2
"This might be my new favorite restaurant.it's made the top 10 list. The past two Fridays, I've been here for dinner and everything is amazing. The second you walk up, you can just tell this is going to be a great dinner spot. The patio is just about the cutest thing ever it's like you're transported outside of the Valley into this magical little courtyard with twinkle lights everywhere what girl doesn't love twinkle lights? n nThe only cocktail I've had there is the Watermelon Cooler I'll add the pic . It's a refreshing gin cocktail equipped with fresh watermelon juice and effen cumcumber vodka everything I love in a cup. The food is amazing. Both times I went, my girlfriends and I shared everything. Some of the highlights are the Burrata with leeks, the berkshire pork belly with udon noodles, and the Duck Confit meatballs. We also tried the lobster fried rice, crab legs, Pork Ribs, and Halibut. Everything is good but my favorite is the pork belly with udon noodles. It's just so GD good. n nThey've only been open about a month so they warn you that they're working out the kinks in service and what not. It doesn't matter. They could make me wait a year and I'd still sit there and sipon my cocktail among good friends to wait for their amazing food. n nHats off to you House Brasserie. I'll be back soon.",2
"Consistently great greek food in a fun atmosphere. Great service. Grew up less than a mile from here, and am a student of the souvlaki. For reference, villa de souvlaki on Sherbrook is a favorite. Great tzaziki tingly! well balanced souvlaki, crunchy tasty calamari, a bar and a terrace. Enjoy!",2
