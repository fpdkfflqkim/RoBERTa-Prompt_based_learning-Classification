Just spent two nights at the Rio Hotel and Casino and only have ONE COMPLAINT the POOL CLOSES AT 5PM. Why? The weather is so nice.,2
"Ive driven by this place a few times, being from Chicago, im very big on Mediterranean food and being new to the area, i was excited. So I stopped in, at first impression the place seems very nice, clean, chairs are great. I get to the cashier, place goes down a few notches, she wasnt nice or friendly at all, completely dulled the first impression of the restaurant. After a few questions I made of the menu, she finally decided to tell me the special which was lamb. yaaay, I love lamb. I asked about the price. she had no clue, after typing a few things she finally told me it was 12. She told me that it came with a side, I said ok waiting for her to ask what my side would be. she continued to type and never asked. I finally told her what I wanted and was instructed to sit and wait. after a few minutes maybe 5, not a good sign my food was ready. I got in the car and my food smelled SOOOO good, i couldnt wait to get back to the office and have my lunch. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT. The rice BLAND, the meat was BLAND and dry, the salad was horrible. the only good things about the plate. the pita bread, some cauliflower thing and my tabouli salad. They have potential, I think a new cashier and a new chef and they might really be in bussiness. I might come back in again if theres nothing else available.",1
Hops has become my favorite lunch place. They have a bottomless potato soup and salad that is to die for. Combine it with a beer and you're set to go!,2
"Copper is an Indian restaurant located in a former home on East Blvd, as apparently all restaurants on East Blvd were constructed in this manner. Recently I was in the mood for great Indian cuisine but did not have any desire to sit in a restaurant. So, having heard mostly positive things about Copper, I made the decision to place an order for pick up. n nFood I ordered the Khoya Malai Maans which consisted of chunks of lamb in a red curry sauce w whole toasted spices. This was accompanied with a pan of basmati rice. I also ordered the Plain Naan buttered and the Saffron, Almond, Paneer Kulcha. This along w a chicken curry dish for my g f came out to be about 50, which I thought to be extremely expensive. Maybe I have just been spoiled by the India Garden in Pittsburgh, PA near the University of Pitt http www.indiagarden.net that offers 50 dine in dinners every night after 11 PM or maybe this was just freakin' expensive! Anyway, being that this was so pricey I expected to be blown away. I was not. While the g f's chicken dish was tasty and well made, my dish consisted of diced lamb that was on the tough side. The spices of the dish were great but tough lamb is something a good Indian restaurant should never have on your plate. The naan was ""okay "" and the Kulcha was tasteless. I was left pretty disappointed. n nService Order was taken promptly over the phone and there were no errors w what I had ordered. n nOverall With this experience, I now cannot wait until Thanksgiving week to head over to the Oakland area of Pittsburgh, sit down, and order some very tasty Indian food. I hope I do not get arrested while there because I now realize the place in Pittsburgh has a steal of a meal. n nPS I will provide a review of Indian Garden while there a month from now.",1
They've got a great 2 for 1999 special food is good good BBQ and the special easily will fill you up and to pay for that price you wil most definitely come back for more,2
"I was in the area looking to kill sometime and grab a quick bite. When i stopped in and the place looked cute! Clean, nice staff, and the Menu looked pretty good. i ordered the veggie souvlaki, and For 8 i would have expected more veggies than taziki sauce. It was basically dipping pita bread in taziki sauce and have maybe a small handful of chopped up veggies. I wont be coming back for the meal i had.",1
"Most pathetic food. If I am sitting at the restaurant and posting this review, you can imagine how bad the food is. You can smell oil while eating. No variety in food. We went seeing the reviews on yelp, but guessing things have changed. Worst Indian food. No recommended at all.",1
"I now know why Ethiopians are so skinny, their food is gross and a huge pain in the ass to eat. I wouldn't eat it either if it was all I had. The whole eating with your hands might be quaint for some folk, I just find it welfare and cheap. Call me crazy, but I enjoy a utensil now and then. I say to the folk of Ethiopia ""treat yoself get some forks "". n nAll in all I'd say that's as close to Ethiopia as I hope to ever come, and the next time someone recommends this restaurant or type of food, it will serve as grounds to immediately never speak to them again and put a horrible curse on their sad existence.",1
"This is our second time coming here. We are so disappointed at the service this time. We were here during lunch time. A lot of plates were empty and they were holding the food on purpose. They wouldn't bring out the food even though it was ready and customers were asking for it. When some food came out, it would be gone in second. Unless you are willing to stand in front of the buffet for a long time, you will not be able to get a lot of food. The quality of the food is so so and certainly is not worth the 24 for lunch.",1
"Outstanding Middles Eastern Food.Plain Simple. n nOmar is my favorite server as he is as friendly and energetic as they come. The food will take a little bit longer to come out then a ""corporate "" joint where the food is cooked by monkeys. So be patient and you will be rewarded. n nOn this recent visit we enjoyed the chicken schwarma plate and the kebab sampler aka The Ali Baba Plate. Lamb is delicious and on the mild side.full of flavor yet more subtle to accommodate american taste buds. n nOn the way out we picked up fresh pita bread and some Afghanistan style flat bread, which made excellent pizza's the next day. n nI LOVE THIS PLACE. Omar is the best!",2
"Buyer beware.you get what you pay for. They did a great job laundering my dress shirts, but when I brought in three pairs of slacks to hem, they did a horrible job and refused to own up to their mistakes. I had to take my slacks back to them three times and they STILL couldn't get the job done right. I finally told them I wanted my money back and I'll go elsewhere to get my slacks hemmed right. I'm sorry.what was that? You can't refund my money? I've given you three different occasions to hem my slacks right and they're STILL not correct.and you can't refund my money? OK.fine. I'll make sure to publicize your lack of customer service. My fellow Yelpers.you've been warned.",1
"We got the one bedroom suite. It was very spacious. You can fit a lot of people in the living room if you want to cut down on costs. The full kitchen is useful, especially the microwave. n The projector on the black out window shade is awesome. I just wished there was a DVD Bluray player connected. nBathroom and shower is nice. n nService was good. The security checking for room cards at the elevators 24 hours was a bit inconvenient. Maybe having it 10 00pm til 6 00am or something would be better. If you're carrying a bunch of things in your hand, it's a pain to pull out your card. nThe walk to the building from the strip is kind of far, but at least you're inside the mall n nI would definitely stay here again with a big group",2
Excellent habanero salsa. I've only experienced S L for bar food and drinks. Service was very polite. Nice clean place.,2
"Now. normally, I wouldn't review an urgent care or something. but my experience here was pretty good, so I figured I'd take a moment to give a shoutout to my neighborhood urgent care. n nMinor medical problem. not something I'd see my gp for, but something I needed a quick look at. Set up an appointment online. super convenient. I had kind of a minor weird insurance situation and the staff was super helpful. I wasn't kept waiting long and the doc seemed totally competent. n nHopefully, I won't have to go there again I've got a good doctor and whatnot but it totally exceeded expectation. n nThen I got a hotdog next door.",2
"If I could give more than 5 stars I would! Jeremy was awesome and made our Las Vegas trip the most memorable ever. We had a group of 7 people and of course we all had different opinions on what to do and when and how much to spend. I emailed a few other companies along with this one and out of all of them Jeremy was the most helpful, was constantly emailing back when I emailed him or text him, didn't seem to mind when I asked a million times to requote and had the best price. He delivered exactly what he said he would, was on time even when we were late, and was very patient . I can't thank him enough for helping us have the best Las Vegas trip ever. We will definitely use his services from now on. I used a different company before and I am glad they never returned my call which forced me to look elsewhere and find Jeremy. Thank you!",2
"Ontrac is horrible, I had a package delivered to my daughters house, she lives in a gated community and although they had phone numbers for herself and I they kept saying they could not delivery because they did not have the gate code. I called and they verified the gate code without assistance from me.so ask yourself, why did they not deliver? The next day, they stated they delivered the package however, my daughter did not get it, when they called the driver he said he delivered it to the first house on the left. I laughed and asked if he stated the address or just location it was just location. Two days later I get a call from the supervisor, they found the package, the driver left it at the first house on the left of the subdivision.hmmm I have to wonder if this driver knows why there are number on houses. If you use ontract, your package will certainly end up lost or it will be delivered to a complete strangers home. We were lucky the people left the package knowing it was an error, most people would not be that honest. To bad there is not a zero or minus five stars, this company is the worst!",1
"This place makes me angry. I've been here every month for the past five months.actually, it may be six. I've lost count. Anywho, I did buy my tires here along with the warranty. Every month my low tire indicator light comes on. Sometimes they try to convince me it has only to do with the weather, but assure me they will check everything out. Needless to say, every time they find something wrong with the SAME tire and proceed to ""fix "" it. And each month they PROMISE that it's fixed and I will NOT be in next month. Today I absolutely had it and told them I wanted a new tire and I got one the only reason they do not get one star . n nFor the most part, everybody here is friendly. Once I did wear a race shirt that says, ""Strip at Night "" on it it's referring to a marathon on the Las Vegas strip, which takes place at night and two workers at the register were snickering while one said, ""I like your shirt "". Felt like I was in high school again. Whatever, just fix my damn tire. n nI live within walking distance so I always drop my car off and ask them to call me when they are finished. Most of the time they don't call. n nNow for my absolute favorite story! Today I received a call about ten minutes after I dropped it off. The guy said my car would not start. I told him that you have to step on the brake and then push the start button. He snidely commented that he already did that ""AT LEAST 50 TIMES "". I thought he or his coworkers would know that so I understood if he felt slightly insulted. I told him I would come by later that afternoon with a friend who knew more about cars than me. n nI went to pick up my car, got inside, put the key in the ignition, put my foot on the brake, and pushed ""START "". Ummm it started right up. I saw the guy who was helping me earlier and I told him it started. He looked shocked and asked me how I did it. PERHAPS there was something that prevented it from starting four hours earlier.but I haven't ever had any problems with my car not starting and I think it was user error. n nI've gone to Discount Tire locations in the past and not had this problem. I will be moving on to another location after this! I'm sure they are just as relieved to hear that as I am saying it.",1
"I go here often because it is close by. It is by far NOT my favorite location. The staff is friendly and all that. BUT what is the deal with paper.I am NEVER given a napkin when I order food. It is now. a game for me.I order. If I do not get a napkin I absolutely do not tip. I think tipping a drive thru for a basic item is ridiculous anyway.but when you cannot give me a napkin, FORGET IT. Another paper issue.receipts wth don't you offer a receipt for every order? I pay cash. For a period of time I was in a situation where I could submit my receipts for reimbursement, I hate having to remember to ask for a receipt. I lost quite a bit of money because of this. I called their corporate.and know that there was no order from above to withhold receipts and napkins. Its the little things that can be so annoying or make someone's day. Smile and give someone ordering a food item a friggen napkin. Is that tooo much to ask? FYI.this napkin withholding occurs morning noon night.",1
"Guys. You charge .99 for one donut but 5.99 for a half dozen. C'mon fix the sign. I have brought this before on premise but the argued the sign wasn't wrong, but inside it's still 5.99. fix the sign.",1
"Keeping this short and sweet because I'm not a fan of tapas. n nSelection here was great. Food was inventive and nicely displayed upon arrival. For the most part, service was quick on our initial order, but then very slow on our order additions. We had to remind them multiple times about orders already placed. n nI didn't really like the type of people this place attracted either, but you'll be fine if you live in Las Vegas but wished you lived in Los Angeles. That is not at the fault of the restaurant, but still a factor in my dining experience. I didn't think the final bill reflective the quality or amount of food we received, but then again, I don't get tapas. n nAlso, we found a giant hair in one of our dishes. I understand no one is going to die from a hair, but at the price you're paying for a tiny dish, I except a little more attentiveness to cleanliness.",1
"I really wanted to like this place. Due to poor service and overpriced entrees, they only get 2 stars. We ordered the black bean fritters with avocado dip, the pulled pork, the Cuban style steak and flan for dessert. It was just ""ok. "" The food alone was at least 3 stars however, in my opinion the price was too expensive for the quality of their food. If I'm going to pay 30 for my meal, I want to at least sit on a non patio plastic chair. n nOn to the service . . . the whole time, we wished we had the other waiter. He seemed happy to work there and was so informative to his customers. Our server was more concerned about pushing us to order more food that she decided to slack on her waitressing abilities i.e. refilling water . She would say subtle things to make us feel like we were not ordering enough, such as ""that's it! just one dessert?, "" ""any other appetizer?, "" ""are you sure you don't want a sangria? "" These weren't said with a smile either. She was worried about her tip amount, and she should be after how she treated us. Needless to say, I would have given them 1 star but the food made up for it. n nI think I'll try some place else for my Cuban fix.",1
My family absolutely loves this place! The owner's and the employees are super friendly. They always have a great variety of fro yo available and a nice mix of toppings. n nThe frequent customer card is great! We are forever getting free yogurts because we go there so much. n nMy favorite at Poppy's? Cheesecake yogurt with granola and chocolate chips absolutely delicious!,2
"In honor of the Steelers winning their sixth Super Bowl, and for my own getting nostalgic about Pittsburgh purposes, I'll write a bit about Station Square. This is where you would take tourists in Pittsburgh, if Pittsburgh ever warranted tourists. But what's interesting about it is that it's still attractive to locals. Unexpected, but true. n nWhy is that? n nBecause it has everything a local yinzer might want from a ""night out on the 'tahn. "" By day, it's a family friendly shopping center, with plenty of shops selling mediocre products, a great Steelers store so you can buy your baby's first Terrible Towel , an outpost of Dave and Andy's awesome ice cream, and a view of the actually impressive skyline, right off the Mon monangahela river. By night, it's got everything else you need Bars Louie, Hard Rock, and Hooters , Restaurants the Grand Concourse is an awesome historic place an old train station , and a comedy club. It's also got great public transit if you take the T or the PAT buses, or even the inclines. n nOn a rare sunny day, Station Square really gives you a sense of Pittsburgh's soul. Simple, blue collar, and kinda great.",2
"Best. Mexican. In. Phoenix. n nHaving grown up in LA, I've had a lot of Mexican food. I was impressed with Phoenix's abundant Mexican offerings, but none stood out as spectacular excepting Barrio Cafe, which I don't consider a traditional ""Mexican Restaurant "" . I was advised by nearly everyone I asked to go check out Dos Molinos, so I did, and it was good. fiery good. n nAnd I don't mean that metaphorically Dos Molinos is the kind of place that doesn't ask you ""how spicy? "" They just bring you your dish, and it's unabashedly spicy, the way it was meant to be, and I can't imagine they could consider doing it any other way. n nAll of us were spicy veterans having all ordered the level 10 spice level at insert any ethnic restaurant name here , and we were all sweating. Bullets. n nI had the Red Chili Enchilada combo plate, and the enchilada's were fantastic. It was the THICK handmade corn tortillas, combined with the shamelessly spicy red chili sauce on top. All the sides were terrific the beans had a kick of their own . n nTheir margarita was also pretty ridiculously large, and tasty. n nDos Molinos is my go to Mexican joint in Phoenix now.",2
I have never been more disappointed in my LIFE! my first experience was so amazing I am now this thinking I imagined the the whole thing. We were a party of 7 with reservations and we were completely forgotten about. yes forgotten. I guess other dinners were more deserving of our food. After 2 hours of being nice and waiting we all snapped and were ready to go. Our imcompentent waiter seemed surprised when we said we were tired of waiting of.REALLY?! if he had done his job we would have spent a fortune on alcohol while waiting but he didn't do that right either. The only good thing he did was tell the manager we were leaving who had enough common sense to stop by and did comp what we did get while waiting. We left and the tip is we should have gone somewhere else. The hubby wanted to stop later in the week for a drink I said NEVER AGAIN for any reason. I would not Wang 7 people to walk out and also being platinum and diamond total reward members.I have been telling everyone and writing lots about my trip isn't there a saying about telling two people who tell two people and so on.all I can say is don't waste your time or money.,1
"Very good information and history on atomic bombs and the testing sites in the state of Nevada. I must say that in fact, it is somewhat of an information overload, especially for someone like me. You'll get to see a number of interactive exhibits and video clips on atomic energy and this important time in American history. Atomic Testing Museum is highly recommended for history and or science fans. There's also a timeline of world events and pop culture around the start of the self guided tour.",2
"We stayed at the Paris because they claimed to be dog friendly. The front desk emplyee at registration was about as friendly and welcoming as a DMV employee on a Monday afternoon. No smile no personality and as stiff as a board. We told them up front that we had a dog, we paid extra because we had a dog, we were honest and responsible about every aspect of our reservation as one could, but she treated us as if our dog was going to destroy the room and proceeded to lecture us about what we would be responsible for should we cause any damage, even if they find something at any date even after we leave. Our dog is crate trained and we brought our crate, so as to make sure nothing happened while we were out of the room. n nWe also booked a couple of hours for a relaxing visit at Paris Spa by Mandara. We booked a massage and facial package that included their three enzyme deep cleaning exfoliating treatment. My massage was good, but I have had much better. My wife specifically said that she wanted lite pressure and nothing that resembles deep tissue, but her masseuse had to be told several times to use less pressure. My wife said it was not relaxing at all. nThe facials were good, but save yourself the money and skip the three enzyme part, or better yet get a spa package elsewhere.",1
"They only get 2 stars because the owner needs to learn some serious people skills! I have eaten there twice, the first time was on a week night and there were only about 8 tables seated. Everyone bent over backwards for us, which I expected because they had the time to do it. We liked it so much that we decided to book their New Year's Eve Party. We were 5 minutes late to our 10 30pm reservation and then stood for almost 10 minutes waiting to check in because a large party was standing in the entryway. The hostess turned out to be the owner saw us standing there and ignored us. When we finally got to check in she told us that they had given our table away so we now had to wait. After waiting 10 minutes I asked how much longer it was going to be because we had been told the food service stopped at midnight. I couldn't understand her answer because the DJ music was so loud. When I told her this she started screaming at me that I could stop yelling at her and that if we didn't like it we could walk out because she didn't need people like us. When I tried to explain that I was speaking loudly because of the music she cut me off and screamed at me some more. The other hostesses and guests were in shock. So I decided to ask her name. Her answer was that she was the owner and I could call her the owner or I could get out. Since there were no other options for dinner at that point I asked how long it was going to be and she said she had to find somewhere to ""put us "". We were finally seated last after she seated 6 groups that came in after us. We reached our table at 11 05 and then sat for another 5 minutes before anyone came to the table. There were at least 5 open tables in the section we were in so it was pretty clear there shouldn't have been a problem ""finding somewhere to put us "". The hostess who did seat us apologized repeatedly for her behavior and said she was sorry there was nothing she could do. It was clear from our conversation with her and other staff during the night that outbursts like this are a regular occurrence and the staff are used to trying to make it up to guests who do stay and eat. I guess it should have been a warning when I saw her grabbing party favors out of a guest's hand and yelling at the woman that she could only have 1 item per person. nOur server was wonderful once he realized we were his table. However it was clear the staff bringing the meat around had no idea how to navigate a full restaurant. My plate was constantly empty and we spent half the night craning our necks trying to find the closest meat server. The salad bar was the usual which surprised me for a party that they were charging so much extra for. It is tiny compared to other Brazilian Steakhouses we have been to and both times they have hit a big pet peeve of mine. They put the salad dressing in front of the tray of salad so lettuce drops into it during the night. By the time we got to the salad bar the dressing was full of lettuce, which is a health code violation. It has happened both times we have eaten there, so it is clearly not something they care to keep neat. The meats were so salty that I had to ask for center cuts. And after being promised they were serving food until 1am, they stopped bringing meat around at midnight. They put out a dessert buffet at midnight. By 12 20 there were about 20 items left and they were all stale like they had sat out all day before being served. The worse part was they didn't have any more so several people didn't even get dessert which was included in the higher price for the party. We finally had to ask for more fried bananas. Once the server realized we hadn't gotten any dessert he brought us something from their regular menu. nThe last thing that bothered me was on the check. The check had been rung up under a different server's name. When I asked about it we were told that our server was the ""second "" on a team and the name was the ""leader "" of the team. I asked where the leader was, and was told she had already left the floor for the night. I thought it was tacky that I was expected to tip a ""team "" of servers when only one person had spoken to us all night. I am not talking about leaving the bussers and such out. I don't think someone who never even spoke to me should get a tip from me. Especially someone who has already gone home even though we are still seated. nWe won't be going back unless someone else is buying for certain. If you do go, make sure it is on a slow night so you get good service and pray you don't cross paths with the owner.",1
"We stopped by Gilligan's on our way to Martini Ranch. We were having a good time taking pictures on the swinging chair and when I tried to get off the chair my purse knocked my drink over. The bartender made me another drink for free! I thought that was really nice and Gilligin's was cool in my book. I was having a good time until an employee accused me of puking in the bathroom. I told her I didn't puke in the bathroom and she said ""Like you would tell me if you did "" I asked her if she was the puke patrol and she kicked me out. Good thing she doesn't have a job where she has to use her judgment because she is not the sharpest tool in the shed. She also made me hate this bar because they have nothing but idiots working here. Except for the guy who gave me a free drink.",1
"Stayed here last weekend for a little Mets Arizona Diamondbacks summer getaway. Booked two nights for Friday and Saturday night and, because it's summer, it was dirt cheap. They were in the process of remodeling a lot of the rooms but that didn't really bother me. They didn't start construction until around 10 30AM. n nThe hotel is in a perfect location if you're going out to the bars clubs in Scottsdale. It's like a block away from them. I was on the 6th floor and you could still hear the clubs at night but it wasn't so bad that you couldn't sleep. If you have trouble sleeping with any noise, it might be too close to those places. It's also super close to shopping, like 3 blocks from the Fashion Square Mall. Not so close that you don't want to drive when it's 110 degrees out, though. n nThe rooms looked like a nice studio apartment. Refrigerator, coffee maker, desk and chair and a sweet L shaped couch with rolling ottoman. The bed was super comfortable, too. The free WiFi is always cool. The hotel offers a ""skillet breakfast "" in the lobby in the morning. It was pretty good. Egg muffins and pancakes and juices and coffee, oh my. n nParking was free but there were limited spaces because of the construction trash bins in the lot. Saturday night I got the last space in the lot at around 9 30PM. I'm sure this problem will be gone when they finish the room construction. In all, this was a great hotel for the rate. It'd be harder to pay two or three times as much for the same room.",2
"Best elongated dog I had! Party of 2 we ordered 1 burgr and my fresh roasted chilli dawg took about 40minutes to get served! Yes 40 minutes! Took the whole ""fresh "" literal. I guess worth the wait when you are not starving.",1
"An interesting selection between healthy and hearty xD. The vibe and service is great and friendly. The menu overall is unique and with some witty, funny names xD. Great place for some free delicious, fruit water. The dishes are done very well with a nice presentable, arty feel to them. Try it out because there's something for everybody for a decent price!",2
"Great hotel right on the Royal Mile. Rooms are very modern and chic, yet functional. Loved the free non alcoholic mini bar in the rooms, US UK power adapter, free wifi, and comfy king bed. Free dry cleaning for 2 items day, additional items not unreasonably priced. Service was prompt and efficient. Location, fabulous. Did not try the bar nor restaurant here but truly enjoyed the stay and would not hesitate to book again.",2
Bomboba has delicious boba tea and the food is awesome ! I love the pineapple mango tea and the pad zu. Give it chance and you'll love it too,2
"Ordered from here last night via CampusFood. It was pretty cheap a grilled cheese fries, a burger fries, and an extra order of fries came to about 15 after tip. n nThe problem was that delivery was horrifically slow. After an hour, we called to see if they were having trouble finding us, since our street is extremely dark. The girl cheerfully told us that our food hadn't even left yet. After another half hour, the food arrived but it was ice cold. Once it was heated up, it was pretty decent for the price. I could tell that the fries would have been good if they were fresh out of the fryer. n nI wouldn't mind eating here again, but I think I would avoid having it delivered.",1
Needed a tinted visor for my Shoei RF 1100 and picked one up a day later. Employee named Charles helped me attach it right there. He then offered to hold my original visor in the back since I had no room on my bike. Great service! Will definitely be back in there when I need some gear.,2
"I ordered a noodle bowl and some breaded shrimp. The bowl was small and barely had noodles. The breaded shrimp was dry, hard, and tasteless. This place was a waste of money and I left hungry. The food is better next door at the 808 sushi place or at Hawaiian Flavor.",1
"This is my second time to use Dino's, I had used them earlier for an Electric Range Repair, that time Joey came and did a fantastic job. This week our Washing Machine quit, I called on Tuesday after Labor day and was told they were swamped, but that a Technician would can the next morning and set up an appointment. John called and made the appointment and he arrived exactly as promised. A very polite, friendly young man, he got right at the problem and in less than an hour found the issue and had it repaired in no time. Once again, I will always call Dino's when I need Appliance Repairs. n nWalter Young",2
"I actually did a search for best pies in Phoenix and this place turned up. Ugh. Well the best place isn't actually near Phoenix, but I wasn't about to drive up 65 miles north to Rock Springs for their apple crumble, and THEN drive back here. n nSo I took a long drive to Mesa, which is a larger city than I thought. And I entered the late morning breakfast crowd of tiny Iowa Cafe. n nThis is a very small place. I sat next the register. I had had breakfast very early that morning so all I came in for. So really I wanted a slice of their ""famous "" pie and a cup of coffee. Mistake I got the ""cherry supreme "", which was a gloppy, thick viscous cream that had bits of cherries in it, whipped cream on top. It was not a pie as much as it was a gloppy pile. Also it smelled and tasted like it had taken on fridge odors overnight.The coffee was stale and not very hot. Oh, and I added a side order of scrambled eggs and they were cold and rubbery. n nI suppose if you advertise that you sell Midwest traditional pies Iowa style you should probably have your best pies out there. But this was not the case that morning.",1
"I remember when they first opened and I tried their Cobb Salad.I was not impressed for some reason. I'm not sure why. maybe because they just opened and it wasn't good before? A Couple months later, I started to give this place another try and then another and then another.Then I found myself going here like every week! I tried most of their salads on their menu and I tried their kale banana strawberry kale drink which was surprisingly really good. I must say that I am a big fan of this place now and on days where I don't want to cook but I want something healthy, this is the go to spot for me. I'm actually glad that this place opened because instead of fast food drive thru's there is now a salad on the go! I'm a little bummed that they don't have their special anymore though.it was the butternut squash salad. That was my all time favorite but their special right now which is the kale caesar is also very tasty! nTheir salads are fresh and for the price they give you a lot! Go check it out!",2
"The Beef Bottle restaurant is a landmark in Charlotte. Unfortunately I've been once in the 20 yrs I have lived in Charlotte. Driving by the restaurant isn't a decor you recognize, but going off of reviews from friends, coworkers, yelp, and other search engines made me realize I have missed out after all those years. The food was incredible for a fine dining restaurant with a set back in time. Black and white photos cover the walls inside the dimly lit atmosphere. The music was a turn off for me and sounded more like a soda shop than a an elegant experience. Service was fantastic. Most importantly is the food. My boyfriend and I ordered the prime rib, mash potatoes, and a salad. Cooked to perfection and leftovers are always a pleasure. I definitely will be back and will pass on the recommendations to friends and family just like reviews were given to me.",2
"Don't even know where to start. Lets just say I was sick all day yesterday Im pretty sure it was due to BLT. n nMy Husband took me here after work the other night cause we LOVE burgers! He ordered Tex Mex burger I ordered the fixed menu for Restaurant week n nBurgers were dry with NO flavor. Like they didn't even use salt pepper. The chili on my husbands burger was barely swiped on his bun like it was mayo.lol. n nNew Castle on tap was horribly flat! n nOnion rings were the mostbland ever! n nI just don't think the menu coordinator has any idea how to pair flavors. on my burger their was carmalized onions which were in this orange type sauce. thousand island dressing. they forgot the bacon too. And piece of lettuce was soggy. bottom bun was so soggy I took it off! No tang to offset all the sweet. I dunno. n nbeing local,. WONT BE BACK. I don't mind paying 25 for a burger cause I do it occansionally anyways but COME ON! my burger should have been juicy flavorful. n nAnd ff did remind me of burger kings! n nohh and the cupcake they gave me that came with my order because it is restaurant weeek. well it was sooo old cold. had been frozen! you couldn't even eat the cupcake with a fork because the icing was too hard! n nI will stick to Shakes Holsteins or Burger Bar ",1
Update I eventually had to have my bank reverse the deposit charge advantage hasn't refunded after 26 days. Unreal. Beware.,1

"For the most part, their sandwiches are delicious, as long as their staff is paying attention! n Earlier this week, my fianc u00e9 and I picked up sandwiches to go, only to find out once we got to work that his was made incorrectly. We called and asked if they would be willing to deliver the correct sandwich to our business which was located less than a mile away, if we didn't have to be at work we would have just taken it back however they told us policy wouldn't allow them to do that and we would have to come to their location with receipt to make sure they actually made it. That's understandable, inconvenient, but I understand business's have regulations. We decided to let it go. n n We tried it again tonight, thinking our previous experience was a fluke. And once again, took our food to work, and my sandwich was completely incorrect. This time we brought it back. n n IF I ever want to eat from here again, I'll make a point to open up the sandwich and check before I leave the store since the employees do not pay attention to customized orders.",1
"Ehhh. n nI'd like for this place to be something. Right now it feels a lot like a stereotypical 'church' coffee shop. If this place was rated on food alone, I could up the ante a bit. I'd call this closer to an American cafe, than a coffee shop maybe I'm just too snobby. n nSome of the baked goods and foods were well done thought out. Some things left me hanging on a questionable note. It's my assumption the coffee isn't a major focus here. So be it. n nAll that said, I've seen shops go from this to greatness. Even in the PHX Metro area, nearly identical shops have gone from this to some of the best in their area. Perhaps given time, this will become something special. If you're in the area, just need a nibble and don't find yourself brewing over beans, roasts, grinds, dosing and the like, this is a place you should perhaps check out.",1
"Of course I hiked up the Cholla trail in September. I didn't know what to expect. I don't think I had the right shoes to wear for this hike. You'll need good traction if you intend to hike up the entire mountain which is basically rock climbing after you reach ""Helipad Plateau "". Be careful, the nice views show a reminder of your early death if you fall off of the mountain from fainting of dehydration or not having a strong enough grip when hugging the mountain. n nFIVE STAR! This hike was so much fun!",2
"Like The closest you can get to Paris, France in the states if you're unable to make it to Europe. Interior is nice including the rooms with a BIG bathroom with tub and shower separated. Sports betting available. Some shopping available plus food options on the ground floor. They gave us some restaurant credit, which we used for room service and for breakfast at their cafe downstairs. I've been up the Eiffel Tower, which is lovely at night to watch the Bellagio water show from up above. On the strip so it's close to everything with a taxi waiting area outside. n nDislike The room had a small tube TV whatever the non flat screen tv is called AND it was off to the side so it wasn't in line of sight when in bed which is how most people in their hotel room end up watching TV . Small fridge wasn't that cold of a temperature. Toilet is in line of sight of the mirror on the back of the door, which can be a little weird watching yourself on the toilet haha.",2
"Wasn't pleased with our service. Easy self check in valet was great. But front desk needs some attention. They have a fabulous, efficient self check in along with huge check in lines and nobody referring them to the kiosk. I was disappointed when I rented a movie fell asleep. Continued to watch my movie in the AM and was charged double. 15.99 times two for the same movie? I even talked to a supervisor. He insisted there was nothing he could do about the charges because the movie had ran all the way through. Smh. What a rip off!",1
"One of my favorite late night spots in Pittsburgh. Great selection of American fare and DELICIOUS appetizers. Half off 11pm 1am, you can't beat it. Make sure you come early to get your name on the list before the late night rush. Some musts Zen Wraps, any of the pizzas minus the margarita which I found to be pretty disappointing for a basic , and the sweet potato fries! You can ask for sweet potato fries only instead of the mix that usually comes on the side of the entrees. Sandwiches are good. especially the braided bread they come on but I'm usually more satisfied after ordering multiple appetizers or pizza also try the baked brie if you like cheese . Salads are a hit or miss depending on when you order them. Their honey mustard is pretty darn good.",2
"I came here with my girlfriend for dinner after a long day, and we were surprised to see that it wasn't Geisha House anymore! We had a groupon for Geisha House, but the person we spoke to said they would honor it anyways so it was a good start haha! n nWe had never seen what Geisha House was before it became Kanji, so I can't really comment on any change in decor or layout. However, it was a really nice setting with an open floor plan. Very well lit with a modern feel to it. n nSince we were looking for a more private dinner this time, we sat at a table instead of the teppanyaki grills. We decided to order the Strip steak and Chicken combo plate, the ""Secret from my husband "" sushi roll LOL , White tiger roll, spicy tuna roll, and another roll I can't remember the name of. Overall, the combo plate was delicious! The fried rice tasted really good, and the shrimp that came with it was awesome! The sushi was also great and the fish tasted super fresh. n nThe service here was A in my books. The waiter was very attentive and came by frequently to fill our cups. He was also very patient with us as we had to spend a little extra time debating what kind of sushi we wanted haha! n nOverall, my girlfriend and I enjoyed coming here and we will definitely be back!",2
"First, let me tell you about the amazing rooms. They are absolutely gorgeous, especially for the price. We stayed in a large 2 bedroom 2 bath condo for the weekend. The furniture was beautiful, the beds were large and comfortable, the appliances were all very nice sub zero fridge! the kitchen came completely stocked with everything you need dishes, pots pans, spices, coffee maker, knife set . n nThe location is great. It is less than a 10 minute walk to the strip. I felt safe in the area it's gated with a security guard . It's not a noisy street or complex. It's just the perfect distance away from all the craziness of the strip yet only a 4 cab ride away. n nThe staff, however, completely ruined my stay. They were completely incompetent and extremely rude. They over charged my card by 600! YES, 600 DOLLARS! It took almost an entire week for the money to be refunded, so I had to barrow money from my friends for the entire weekend. Upon checkout, we wanted to split the remaining tab on 2 separate cards not my card, since I still had no money left on it . They said it wouldn't be a problem. Friend 1 should have been charged about 300, friend 2 should have been charged 300. What did they do instead? They charged ME another 600. I realized this after I got home and called right away. They said they would fix it. Instead they charged Friend 2 the entire 600 tab. n nBy this point I was furious. This is completely ridiculous. I do not understand how a hotel staff could really be that dumb. The manager was neither sympathetic nor apologetic. He blamed us for being ""difficult "" with our credit cards instead of owning up to his mistake. n n I will never be going back, simply because of the stress and inconvenience this hotel caused our party.",1
"Love this place! The staff is so nice, they know me by name when I walk in now! I love going to Flea Bags for their homemade dog treats, dog birthday cakes their large selection of Tuffy toys. Tuffy toys are expensive 25 , but THEY LAST!",2
"Okay, you fans that go to D'Backs games? You're godawful. You are the most humorless, bland, and unexcitable group of people I have ever seen outside of Dodger Stadium! n nThat said, I went to a game in July of 2001. Your team was in FIRST PLACE! i saw Big Unit pitch. and you were hard pressed to be HALF full. By the way, for the love of god, decide what your name is. n nThe best was when Randy Johnson came up to bat, I would just start yelling ""UNIT! CHICKS DIG THE LONGBALL! "" and the two middle aged men in front of me laughing uncontrollably. Everyone else? Annoyed. And my best friend turning to me, saying, ""Dude, these people look like they want to kick your ass. "" n nBut hey, we didn't leave empty handed. I mean, what was that stupid promotion you guys did? Where if your pitchers hit a certain strikeout total, everyone there got a voucher for a free fountain drink at Circle K? Yeah, there's no Mark Cuban owning that park, that's for sure. Way to screw up an otherwise beautiful park. n nOh, and if you can't sell out an NLCS game? You really should just become a Triple A affiliate of the Dodgers. That's just depressing.",1
"We actually tried to go to Berlin Cafe but it is closed on Saturday for lunch. Since I was hangry, i just needed to eat and this was next door. n nThe space reminds me of a diner with seating and an open kitchen. The seating area was decorated minimally with some wall decor and small fake floral pieces on the table. n nThe server was friendly and nice. A little young and needs to learn the service process more, as our table did not have enough silverware and she never came back to check on us n nWe ordered nSilver Noodle Salad this was a 3 out of 5 in spice level and out was out of control hot for a ""medium "". In terms of flavor, I couldn't taste it because my mouth was burning. n nMongolian Chicken not Chinese style but good flavors n nPad See Eww it was ok, nothing special. n nI would not come back.",1
"Alright yelpers maybe we went on an ""off night "" and didn't get the experience some of the others have described in their reviews, but this place is terrible! Right off the bat, my husband I stood around like weirdos waiting to be acknowledged to be seated.when there was an empty table.yes Mr. Waiter we are here to eat not just standing around in front of your restaurant to watch others eat.jeezz! So we get to sit don't feel very welcomed. .money is still green right? Anyways we order the ceasar salad shrimp scampi, the salad was just like any other you can get anywhere our pasta dish was blah! It didn't look appetizing and had unnecessary bread crumb crap on top of the shrimp that my husband I both had to scrape off to taste the flavor of the shrimp. Oh and the garlic bread that I was sooo looking forward to after reading the other reviews wasn't great, I don't know if we got an old batch or they cooked ours differently, but they lacked flavor. We will absolutely never eat here again even if it's the last Italian restaurant left in Vegas. Our waiter never checked on us once delivering our food, only to leave the overpriced bill for our overrated food that lacked flavor quality. .to others reading this craving Italian food late at night.go somewhere else.",1
"Well Kevin after years I have finally found your scumbag con artist ass. This so called ""website developer "" is a thief of the highest order. He was recommended by a friend who was also in the computer business and this work was to be done for my boss.

"Let me just start by saying that I have been to this salon several times. The owner Ann does a great job whenever I've had services with her. n nHowever, my friend and I went the other day for eyebrow waxes and did not have a good experience. We both had girls that we hadn't met before. n nI went first and she rushed me into the back room. n nFirst let me start by saying that when I get an eyebrow wax I expect it to take about 10 15 minutes. I've had at least 50 eyebrow waxes She spent a grand total of maybe 2 minutes on my eyebrows. All she did was wax them! She didn't trim them or tweeze them AT ALL. And trust me, they needed it! n nWhat was even worse was she spent the entire 2 minutes trying to upsell me to get other services. She said AND I QUOTE ""Oh you need a facial you have a big pimple! "". HOW RUDE. As if I would stay and endure another minute of her criticism. Then she asked me if I was getting a lip wax as well. I was so offended. My upper lip is NOT hairy and certainly doesn't need a 15 wax. n nMy friend had the same experience. They spent almost no time on her eyebrows and just tried to get her to do other services while we were there. n nI can usually go about 4 6 weeks between eyebrow waxes. But this time I will need another within 2 weeks. n nI will not be going back to this salon.",1
"A few months back.2 18 11 n nSorry for the late review.I was steaming so much from my experience it took like 6 month to calm down. n nLong story short, I received a comped 250 shopping voucher from Cesars. I chose to use it at H M that day. Had spent 2 hours shopping and lost my voucher trying on a coat. Asked the security guard just seconds later if he saw a voucher and he said he found it. He had given it to the manager on duty. n nWent to ask the manager for the voucher and out comes this little Asian dude. He said he could not give me the voucher back, ""How do I know its yours? "" Really? I'm the only one out 200 people in the store frantically looking for a lost voucher only minutes ago. Basically he knows he can use that voucher himself at any other store in the Cesars mall. n nI went the distance to call the Police.they couldn't do anything! I asked to rip up the voucher and little asian manager dude said he'll do it later. I said no do it now because I know youre going to use it. Everyone around said he should rip it up too. I tossed the clothes that I was gonna buy in his face. n nBTW.he said the cameras are fake .total BS n nWas once a H M fan and have not yet bought one item from them again! I wrote a formal complaint to Cesar Entertainment and thanks to them my host gave me a 500 credit.thanks. And I did not use it at H M.",1
"Wow, Treasure Island hotel rooms are dark, smelly, and have moldy bathrooms with water stained doors. I expected better. Stayed on the 24th floor. Nice View, but wow. There's also a 28 resort fee.

"Umm. ok so I couldn't find the door to this place when I first pulled up blonde moment, I know , but who can blame me when I walk up expecting a juice smoothie shop and I see clothes inside? Come to find out, they also have yoga and spin classes here and sell some yogi stuff as well. n nAnywho, I finally found the door and walked in wanting a nutrient packed juice or smoothie. The guys at the juice bar kinda walked me through their menu a bit, explaining a few items. I was so intrigued by the ingredients of their smoothies, that I opted for ""The Clark Kent "" and could hardly wait to try it until I started looking at the menu some more and realized they had seasonal ""guest appearances "" on the menu. Doh! I asked the guy behind the counter if he had started to make my drink yet, to which I THOUGHT he said yes. and asked why? I told him I just realized they had ""The Gingerbread Man "" on the menu and would've liked that one instead, but told him that it was alright, and would come back another time to try it hoping they would still have it by then . n nBut then to my surprise when I took that ""love at first sip "" sip out of my smoothie. Lo and behold, it was ""The Gingerbread Man ""! I don't know how the guy managed the ol' switcheroo but I'm glad he did! This smoothie literally tastes like you're eating gingerbread cookies, but it's GOOD FOR YOU! If THAT'S not amazing, I don't know what is. I'll be back to try one of everything on the menu. it just looks so good.",2
"This review is for the location on Mtn Spring in chinatown please for the love of baby Jesus stay away from this place. We rented our property on an emergency basis and I didn't bother to look up reviews before hand. RIGHT NOW my air conditioner has gone out for the third time within a 4 month period. First time was arnd April and thankfully it wasn't hot but from the time I reported it broken to the time it was fixed was nearly 2 weeks. 2nd time was 4th of July weekend and from time of report to fixing it was out 4 days. 3rd time is now and I reported it broken on July 29 and my air is not fixed and it's frickn over 105 degrees out. Since I have 4 kids in the home, I had no choice but to purchase a very small 300 portable air conditioning unit and when I emailed this lady that I was going to take the expense off rent and she said ""yes "", I get there to pay my adjusted rent minus the expense and these fools want the entire rent and told me IF the home warranty ppl the ones paying for repair replacement of AC decides to reimburse me that's up to them but they want all the rent.OH HELL TO THE NO! so now I have to work through this problem. Apparently they want my children to die of heat stroke and exhaustion before they will think about making any kind of accommodations even though THEY are responsible for managing the property and maintaining it according to state law. Sooo now I'm going to call housing authority and get in touch with a lawyer for their gross negligence. My youngest is 9 months old ppl! This is absolutely crazy and no one frickn knows when the AC unit will be fixed b c ""they order part or something "". Just stay away, just say no!",1
"I'm so glad I found this gem of a salon! It looks like a salon Tabitha Coffey would have decorated herself. It's clean, no dust and hair everywhere, the stylists are edgy as in attire and they have constant CE! I found Melissa here on Yelp! and I couldn't be happier. I'd been wanting a change for a while and my former stylist was never able to deliver. It was very frustrating. I'm naturally red and I wanted a red ombr u00e9. I brought pics of the color as well as the style I was looking for and Melissa delivered! I was offered a beverage of my choice, all the magazines were current who wants old, crappy magazines while sitting under the dryer? and every single staff member smiled and made chit chat. It made the three hours I was there very enjoyable. The Parlor is the perfect name. It gave that energy of the time women spent all their time at the parlor not just for treatments, but the company. It was an A experience. I'm so thrilled. I go in next week for the deep conditioning treatment!",2
"I would never trust them for more than cleaning my teeth! You walk in to get a service and you are told it costs , you go home and then you get a bill. Very unprofessional staff and dentists. It is more of a business place rather than a ""care providing "" clinic. If you want to go there, count your teeth before and after!",1
"A very good and solid choice that is consistent with each purchase. n nThis place is very, VERY friendly and always has solid coffee. The owner is awesome, always accommodating and engaging with everyone in her shop. n nIf you are walking on Butler Street and need a coffee joint to hit up, I would HIGHLY recommend this place. n nFun, comforting and quite atmosphere.",2
"I was really disappointed in AZ Wines. Yes, they have a good selection of wines and it's bout the only place you can find local wines. However, I went there for a tasting and was extremely disappointed in the service. nI was with friends and we waited about 20 minutes before receiving our first sampling. The pours were tiny and it felt like we were inconveniencing the staff. There are many places I would prefer to go before trying this place again!",1
"Ohmygosh. That bulgogi chimichanga?! Incredible. I wish I had not discovered that. It's way better than it has a right to be. Now I crave it. Tried to save half for another meal. Couldn't do it! Get in my belly! mouth is watering, dammit! ",2
Cost 40 to wash my 12' box truck. They said it would be hand washed and dried. The wash was ok but truck was not dried. Dripping wet it sun dried w water spots on glass and mirrors. They dont do any interior glass etc. total waste of money. I had to clean truck again myself after dannys. Dont waste your money here its essentially a dude w a hose and ladder that will do a wrinse and done in 5 min. Given how their car washes are quality and the cost i was pretty shocked by the lack of value. n nYou know those fund raiser car washes done in parking lots? Thats this place but its covered. At least w the fund raiser car washes they dry your car.,1
Let me start by saying how excited I was all week to come here . But how dissatisfied I was when I finally tried the food. whatever you saw on tv or in photos is a let down to the real thing . it truly saddens me to have to say this but I wouldn't give it another try . plz don't take my word go ahead and try for yourself but remember I warned you .the food is bland and conveniently pre plated yes but presentation over quality is distasteful . Some of the things I've seen on tv that I went eager to try aren't there anymore and don't even talk about fried chicken when you get it this bad. the skin was on it still and if you know cuisine you must take that off when cooking it in this manor. I mean who was cooking the food the bench chefs. c'mon it was Sunday still a popular day in Vegas during July . I'm sorry Cosmo this food is as bad as your parking garage .,1
"This place has fewer special options than other ihops and in definitely understaffed. Food was below average, price was standard IHOP price. I wouldn't recommend stopping by there are other better restaurants in the area.",1
When my lips touched Sheridan's Custard I knew I was hooked forever!. Their menu is completely robust and kinda overwhelming but when in doubt be simple and get a simple scoop of frozen custard. I visited this place last weekend and can't wait to go back. You have the drive up 50's feel and very friendly staff. What I recommend Buk A Roo.,2
"DO NOT RENT FROM AVIS AT MANDALAY. The front desk was rude and they make you clean THEIR CAR since they have no cleaning facility on site. We were told that their 35 to 75 ""cleaning fee "" was assessed on MOST OF THEIR CUSTOMERS upon return. I could not get ANY answer as to what constituted ""too much "" dirt. Evidently ANY dirt inside or out results in a fee. It's completely up to them to decide if you get the fee. This is ridiculous! It's just a scam to get more money on top of the extra they charge for the ""Convenience "" of renting at the hotel. Then to top it off, the car we got was dirty on the outside with FOOD spread around the inside. To avoid the ""FEE "" we cleaned the car. What a great SCAM rent dirty cars then charge people if they don't clean them up! n nWe had the rudest bartender at the Beach Grill. He actually insulted my Fiance because she tried to get his attention from the girls he was flirting with. A total a ole.",1
"Typical grocery and drug store owned by the Kroger chain. Rotisserie chickens were okay, though soaking in big fats of grease within their individual bags and we couldn't tell the difference between the ""lemon pepper "" and ""garlic herb "" varieties . Olive bar, deli and bakery, plus the full drug store. Just kinda underwhelming, especially compared to all the fresh and prepared foods at Fresh and Easy nearby.",1
"Words cannot express how much I hate Las Vegas. I was kind of bummed when I found out my whole company had to go for a work thing, but things started looking up when I found out they sprang for us to all have our own rooms. n nWe ended up at the Red Rock. This place was actually pretty awesome. You really never have to leave the place. It is HUUUGE. There are like 10 restaurants, a bowling alley, a movie theater, insane swimming pools, and a low douchebag factor due to the fact that it's like 10 miles away from the strip. But you still get all the gambling and booze of Vegas. n nThe rooms have flat screen tvs in the bathroom on the wall in the bath tub! The bathrooms have separate tub and shower. n nI actually had one of my favorite nights ever at this place. Picture me, after being in a meeting all day, quite tipsy with my buddies who also happen to be my coworkers and deciding to retreat back to my room. On my way back, I see there is a bakery. I stop in and buy a pastry to take back to my room. When I get back to my room, I decide I am gunna take advantage of the uber deep bath tub. It is Saturday night at about midnight which means Cheaters is on. Yes everyone, my most favorite night ever was me watching Cheaters and eating a pastry while taking a bubble bath, drunk.",2
"I have been going to Infinity off and on for 5 years. When I go I usually request Lilly. I have to say it's hit and miss with this place. Sometimes everyone provides exceptional service, sometimes they don't, but like anything else you get what you pay for. Also too I have seen people be extremely rude and condescending to the employees who work there. Just remember people, treat others how you want to be treated. You treat them kindly with respect they will do the same. Only on a few occasions would I say that I haven't been satisfied with their work. All in all I do love it there!",2
An amazing quirky restaurant. i haven't tried a lot of thai food but it was all delicious and all at a good price. Highly recommend!,2
"Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week, but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only 22, which included unlimited champagne. What a deal! n nTheir international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach, so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets, fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets, awesome carving station, giant made to order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts. n nSave the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!",2
"Food Minus 1 Star. With the exception of the pancakes, the food that this restaurant offers is not good. nCost Minus 1 Star. The lack in quality of the food does not deserve the price this place charges. I think I'd rather go to Ihop. nCustomer Service Minus 2 Stars. The people in this restaurant are not exactly the smartest people. Nor are they the fastest in getting us the food either. n nOverall, this place is not worth the wait if you have to stand in line. Just go to ihop.",1
"I made a reservation on Jan 6, 2012 for a suite the weekend of June 8 10 at a great rate and had to pay the full amount up front. This past weekend my reservation was cancelled claiming that my room was no longer available even though I booked 5 months in advance of my trip. Presumably so MGM can rebook the suite at a higher rate. I will gladly take my business elsewhere on the Strip.",1
"Went in here for the first time recently, intending to use the appetizer wine tasting Groupon. Upon walking in, the hostess seemed inconvenienced and asked ""Can I help you? "" Well,um, we'd like a table duh . Though there were some open, she said they were all ""reserved, "" so we asked if we could sit at one of the many that were open outside. She went and checked to see if they were available, then came back and said they weren't going to open the outside. Hmmm. well that's a bad business decision. People arriving and waiting for tables, all the tables inside are ""reserved, "" there's plenty of tables available outside on a beautiful evening, yet they won't open that area. We walked out and didn't think twice about it.",1
The food here was pretty standard bar food. The service was not good. Our waitress never came to check on us after we got our food. We had to come up to the bar for boxes. The cheese curds were good and cheap. It was the best thing we had.,1
Average pizza. But with ten guys working and not much business at the moment it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.,1
"I'm kicking myself for not going here sooner! n nOne thing Charlotte doesn't have a lot of is good middle eastern food. If you find yourself in need of an emergency fix, get yourself to La Shish Kabob, STAT! It's only a ten minute trip from uptown Charlotte. n nI had the mixed grilled kabob plate, which is a sampler of all their chunk meat and kafta kabob offerings over a delicious rice pilaf. Very, very tasty stuff. Make sure you ask for the red and green hot sauces relishes, really that they keep behind the counter. That'll take your meal over the top. n nI tried their baba ghanoush and hummos, and both were excellent. n nTo top it all off, the guy who runs the place looks like a characher from lord of the rings. You'll know what I'm talking about when you go try this place out, which you should do immediately.",2
"Not even nice for a sports bar. The bathrooms could use a lot of work. The stainless steel stalls of the bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. Seat cleaners were empty and one door was had duct tape holding it together as a repair job. Seems like any chain restaurant should have better standards than this. n nThe bar was not busy but we waited forever for drinks, appetizers and refills. I was not impressed and my boss who suggested McFadden's after our event at UOP stadium, was very displeased. n nWe had a group of no more than 8 people, who arrived one by one. The server was unable to get drinks and orders taken in a timely manner for new guests. We ordered hummus for the table and when the pita and cucumbers were all gone, by boss asked for more pita to finish our hummus. There must have been some sort of mixup with another order that was placed because the pita still didn't show up after 20 minutes had passed. The manager had an excuse about the server ringing in an order as an appetizer vs. entree. I'm aware this mistake happens in serving. I was a server for years, but in this situation I feel that if you ask the kitchen for some pita, it shouldn't take that long even if the server made a mistake with the order. It only takes a minute to heat up and put on a plate. We could have been satisfied with a simple we are sorry and we are working on fixing it right now. n nIt seemed like even the manager would rather make an excuse than just get the job done. A manager should set the example and level of customer service for the whole restaurant. It was a sad display. n nI don't see myself returning to McFadden's for any reason in the future.",1
I really enjoy coming to this place. The patio is really cozy and I would recommend sitting out there. I have only had the late night menu but I always enjoy my food and the margs are good too. Try the green chili quesadilla.so delish. P.S. The patio can be slippery because of the waterfall. I face planted it the other night and my boyfriend is STILL laughing. Be careful!,2
"The staff at this location are more than a little helpless. They don't know how to ring up purchases, don't properly order your food and are less than friendly. n nI was there for lunch just now and was shocked by the lack of service. My friend ordered mac and cheese with her salad and had to ask three different times about the mac and cheese to no avail. The mac and cheese finally came out about fifteen minutes later! That's just crazy. n nWhen checking out, the cashier did not know how to ring up our food and was unable to locate the appropriate icons for the food. And we didn't order anything special or extraordinary. everything we ordered was straight off the menu without modifications. n nTo top it off, the location is a little out of the way if you work downtown, and the interior is cramped and poorly laid out. Don't expect this to be a quick lunch stop. the line moves slow and the staff even slower. n nThe only person in the entire restaurant that knew what was going on was a nice man named Brian. He was the one that had to help the cashier figure out how to ring up the food and personally made our mac and cheese. Without him we might have perished for waiting. He should get a promotion to trainer! Excellent customer service and attitude. He even offered us free cookies for the wait! n nParadise Bakery is moderate food to begin with, but pair it with the poor service and mediocre location and that food becomes overpriced nonsense. n nThere is obviously an issue with poor management, otherwise this wouldn't be happening. This location really needs to work on properly training their staff and improving the efficiency of the ""line. "" n nUntil they do, they get one VERY GENEROUS, nay, yelp protocol obligatory, star.",1
"Clever Koi Is exactly what was needed on central. A unique innovative Restaurant. n nAesthetically, it's very nice , great lighting decor, ambiance music. n nToday was the ""soft opening "" and the the place was packed which was pretty impressive because everyone knew about it from word of mouth. n nThe Food I tried the Pork Noodles and they were delicious and for 11 the price wasn't bad. I had the ""enabler "" cocktail, it was Ok, kinda pungent, I'll def try something else next time. I'll be back soon to try other things and update my review.",2
"Second time here and I still haven't tried the burgers. They looked pretty decent coming out, but I don't like the knife stabbed through the burger. I'm too old school to cut my burger in half please. This was a decent happy hour with about 7 beers on special and one rotating one hibiscus today.too weird to try . The tap on Mr. Pineapple went bad after my first draft, but it was only 4 for some craft beers, which is an average deal. In a perfect world, all domestics would be 2 and craft beers and imports all 3. Anyway, the 5 pretzels were amazing with a tasty, but not hot pepper cheese sauce on the side. Huge, buttery and salty these were a 2 savings on regular price 1 for 5 . Very good appetizer and there were about 6 others on the 5 app menu. Most save you about three dollars and there is a 7.50 burger on that menu too. The lowest priced regular burger is 10 bucks. Always a good staff as well and volume on the football game.",2
Amazing! The highlight of our Vegas trip. The truffled egg sandwich is incredible. Good coffee too.,2
"We went here on vacation in early October. The weather was perfect. We went with an 8 year old 3 year old 2 grammas had a fantastic time. They loved the little train ride, the mine tour the mystery shack. 2 months later my 3 year old is still talking about it. The little town was really cute overall. I would plan on at least 4 hours to be able to do the activities then mosey around the town a bit. nWe had lunch in the Saloon my hamburger was VERY TASTEY! I was surprised that they had that good of food at an obvious tourist destination. The price was a little high but in all reality we expected that. Overall we enjoyed the experience!",2

"I went for the happy hour oysters which were delicious but I don't think I had one oyster without shell in it. I also enjoyed the calamari which was nice and crispy but very bland. I've had much better for much less and the service was very agressive for an empty restaurant. Also, the waitress gave me an incorrect price for the wine she suggested and no information about which oysters I was recieving.",1
"Love this place have been patronizing Carambas for 17 years, love the Union Hills location love the staff, however the patio needs shade! Umbrellas have been removed and shade is so needed! Great inexpensive fresh food.killer margaritas best for the price!",2
Former fan of this chain nWe gave them a couple of weeks to get the kinks worked out before giving them a test drive nAlways seemed to be people waiting when we drove past so we expected a good experience nThey had a lot of staff walking around yet our service was very slow from getting our drinks to receiving our order. Process is consistently bad nWhen we got the pizza it was not worth the wait nor the 40 it cost nI normally ignore reviews that focus on the service figuring the people just had a bad day. nIn this case I can find nothing positive to say about this location nWe dine out 4 or 5 times a week so have a basis for comparison nGo to Uncle Sams for a really good pizza and no drama,1
"Just got off the plane and needed some lunch. Heard this was a pretty good spot. NOT! Maybe because I'm spoiled from the Bay, cuz this right here is nothing good aside from the AC. n nThe egg noodle seafood was a mere two bites. The so called seafood was a few cuts of the fake crab meat, 2 shrimps, and 1 shrimp cake ball. The broth was subpar. n nThe worst was the lemon grass chicken. It's not the chicken steak or thigh that I'm used to that is grilled. This was all chopped up in pieces and it tasted and looked more like Kung Pow chicken than the real deal. n nBottom line disappointed! Not returning even if I was in the area.",1
"La Bocca has 309 reviews as of the date I am writing this . . . so what can I tell you that is different and unique about this Urban Pizzeria and Wine Bar to make you want to try it . . . if you haven't already? n nI have to admit I never have eaten one of their pizzas, nor have I ever had a glass or two of wine here. The first thing I ordered on my first visit was their Heirloom Beet Salad. I love beets and never buy or cook them at home. Most restaurants, that do serve them, have absolutely no idea how wonderful and versatile they can be, nor how to prepare them properly. n nI understand that everything else they serve is excellent . . . but I may never get a chance to try any of them. I will continue to eat the Heirloom Beet Salad until they remove it from the menu, or until I totally burn out on it! Naught! Doubtful, very doubtful.",2
"I went in to service I had a knock in my motor they spent 2 weeks on it they told me the cam bearings were bad 1,500 later the same knock was still there and they said they couldn't hear then when I brought it back they heard it then they wanted to charge me to finish the job which the cam bearings and cams were not bad.",1
"I decided to start some small gardening projects at our house but prior to doing so I made sure to run it by the boss. My 4 year old daughter. You have probably had the conversation, ""Hey sweety, do you want to start a garden and grow some fresh veggies that you can later eat? "" Her obvious response was , "" Yes, daddy, lets grow blueberries and Bananas. "" That is when I had to reel her in and let her know that we do not live in the rain forest so the bananas may be a Little excessive but I lover her tenacity. Needless to say we ended up in the car on our way to the nursery this morning. The wind made the trip a little less enjoyable that it could of been but we took in our fair share of greenery. n nWe have two large 5 gallon decorative pots on our doorstep that we decided to add some flowers to so why not start there. I was like a kid in a candy store, now it could be because we own our house now so the thought of planting a damn plantations worth of trees seemed like something that I would actually undertake. My daughter could not have been more excited either. As soon as we strolled by the large selection or seedling vegetables and fruits it was on like donkey Kong in her mind. n ""Daddy, can we get strawberries, How about cucumbers, come on dad we really need the pumpkins. I am far from a farmer but it was nice to see my daughter so excited about planting fruits and veggies I almost started basking the happiness she had and started grabbing pepper plants and cantaloupes and dancing the jig. But something kept me grounded, maybe just my better judgment and we headed to the flowers. n nWe left with 6 potted flowers and some of the Dr. Q brand potting soil and filthy rich potting soil and some new gardening tools, a watering can and some sweet zebra gloves for my daughter. The service at the counter was great and they really do have everything you can think of for all of your gardening and landscaping needs. We are getting ready to undertake our backyard and I think we found the go to place. I don't know that this is the place for me to go alone with my daughter. We may try to create that rain forest I mentioned earlier.",2
"This finally concludes one of the last shows I have never seen in Vegas, as well one of the only Cirque du Soleil shows I haven't seen yet. n nI can't find a way to give it 5 stars simply because their proliferate use of ""actor "" audience members got really tiring after a while, but I have to say I am extremely impressed by the stage, the show, their entrances and exits and their visual appeal. n nThe only thing I disliked was that there was a huge lack of storyline. I mean I think they tried but it seemed like they had a small box and tried to cram too much into it. It just didn't work. n nVisually, this show is absolutely stunning. There's nothing short of breathtaking from their acts to their various themes and multiple stage changes throughout the show. I don't know if this show is worth the high price tag that you pay to see it if you're interested in a story line and something coherent to grab onto but it's definitely Vegas entertainment at it's very best. n nI would say this is a must see show for Vegas, so if you haven't seen it, pay up because it is worth seeing at least once.",2
"Wow. Didn't vote for this thing. And had I known that the primary users of the infamous ""folly trolley "" would be the same snotty, elitist Scottsdale pricks who fresh off the plane from Los Angeles regularly clutter up our freeways with all manner of comically inconsiderate driving related antics, I would have commited voter fraud simply to prevent this ridiculous waste of state money's passage. But I digress. n nThe thought process of the think tank that concocted this monument to instant obsolescence must have been as follows n nStuffy Snobsdale Suit 1 Alright, folks. Phoenix has a public transportation problem.

Now, on to pointless smoking ordinances. n n Ahem n nOh, yeah, I rode the thing. Alot of people have been talking about the cleanliness of the cars. I would have to disagree on that one. Sure, the cabin doesn't reek of urine or anything, but some of the surfaces do have that dull, darkish dirtiness to them think, the ball pits at McDonald's . The colors of the car's innards remind you of maybe the New York subway system, but with less fecal matter give it time . and of course, with 99 less speed or usefulness. Honestly, the Universal Studios tour bus moves faster than this nearly inert silvery heap. And while we're on the subject of its shiny exterior, who painted this pokey, pastel metal tube?

"I'm so glad my friend Rico invited me here for brunch this morning, as this is by far the best brunch place I've been to in the Phoenix area. The Sunday buffet brunch choices included bacon, breakfast sausage, omelets from an omelet station, fresh fruit slices, sliced deli meats, potato salad, penne, various pastries, and more plus coffee, orange juice and other beverage choices all at great price. The staff was very friendly and attentive, and the food items were constantly being replenished. Cozy seating induces pleasant conversation. This is a truly phenomenal dining destination in the downtown area.",2
"So it's late at night, you've been drinking in a town that never stops pouring. In the final round, you decide to take on some local culture at a nearby dive bar where you realize that the 4.99 breakfast buffet really doesn't hold up it's own. Stomach grumbling, you find yourself stumbling around in a ""not so good "" neighborhood searching for something to curb the battle going on inside your empty insides. The bartender pointed you in the direction down Twain Ave where, like a beacon of salvation, your quest for greasy food is at an end. n nVictor's Taco Shop is about as ""authentic "" as you get. Upon entry, you're blasted with warm air. The temperature in this place is even hotter than it is outside! That explains the extremely sweaty cooks behind the counter who are all but unaware of your arrival. The sound of Mariachi music is blaring from behind the counter and your only relief from the sweltering heat is a power fan blowing in the direction towards the counter itself. n nYou order a plate of 5 Rolled Tacos with everything on it and the counter cook looks at you like you're speaking a foreign language. He repeats the order, but shorter and asking in broken English how many you want. You tell him that you want 5 Rolled Tacos, he looks at you again like he doesn't understand. He asks if you want 5 orders of rolled tacos. You correct him and say you only want 5 of them. He responds with a completely off base response asking if you want an Number 5. n nAgain you correct him, now pointing to the picture on the menu with the 5 Rolled Tacos. He gets it now and you clarify that you wanted the sour cream and guacamole on it as well. The cook confirms and they get to work on your order. After what seems like an eternity standing there waiting for your order you contemplate playing one of the video games sitting along the wall. The screen is faded and you decide to pass. n nMeanwhile, a young Hispanic man enters the Taco Shop. His pupils are heavily dilated and he's giving off nervous energy. He places his order in Spanish, pays for the meal, and moments later. The burrito is in his hands and he's out the door. You notice that your rolled tacos are sitting on the ledge under the heat lamps. n nThe counter cook notices that you noticed as well and hands them to you with a malicious smile. He got one on the gringo. Realizing that you don't have anything to wash the tacos down with, you purchase a bottle of Coca Cola for 2.25. Peeling back the aluminum foil on your rolled tacos, you are greeted by the food slapped together poorly. The guacamole and sour cream are runny. Defeated, hungry, and now your buzz is gone you finish your rolled tacos. You exit the restaurant only to realize that there's a Roberto's in the same strip mall. n nMy .02 Cents n2 Stars Poor food quality, hot and gross dining facility, poor service. My suggestion is to head to Roberto's right behind them. You get more for you money and don't need to speak Spanish to get good service.",1
"Happy hour here last until 6 30p, score. And they have a good variety of cocktails. n nFood is solid. Not as many rice options as I would like. They concentrate more on curries, soups and noodle dishes. n nThere is an open dining area, so it can be a bit noisy, but not too bad. The atmosphere is sort of like a nightclub lounge, so not a big kid and family spot. But if your kiddos are older or reasonably behaved it shouldn't be a problem to bring them. There isn't booth seating, but they do have booster seats available.",2
"If you look closely, there is a 50 cent charge for water. It is not itemized on the receipt. The charge is hidden. Extra sauces are 1 pricey in my opinion . Usually out of several menu items at a time. Sodas and tea are 2.75 more expensive than a beer .",1

"Same Day Service! Donny from Swimming Pool Butler saved my swamp of a pool after that crazy dust storm. He was very friendly, located close to my house and fast. My pump wasn't working. I had done the backwash a couple times and cleaned the filter and nothing. By the time I had Donny come over the pool was a green muddy mess.

He will answer your questions via phone. He is very personable and friendly.",2
"The only reason there is not five stars is that its a little confusing to order and hectic and the last time we were there the tables were not bussed.

"Ms A. and I happened upon Sensi while scoping out the lobby of Bellagio and it was so beautiful and serene not common qualities on The Strip we decided we'd perch at the bar for a bit. Well, the staff were nice and welcoming so we ended up staying for dinner. n nMan, what a dinner it was! Ms A. had the tandoor baked chicken in a curry butter that was indescribably tender and luscious. I had seared dayboat scallops, skewered with oxtail ravilolis. Both were utterly out of this world. We had martinis, dry and delicious. Our bartender recommended the excellent asparagus tempura as a starter. n n ""You'll thank me, "" he said. Well, we thanked him and whatever happenstance steered us down that hall at Bellagio, too. A great meal and although pricy, not at all out of line on Las Vegas Blvd.",2
Hi I just wanted to leave a very positive review for a awesome lady named Dessi ! Me and my husband came in yesterday to get our yearly fresh cut Christmas tree and Dessi was such a joy. So upbeat and friendly. Was even informed she came in on her day off to help. Because of the busy holiday season. Now that's commitment to her job and customers. I thanked her for coming in and helping us. On her day off. A lot people wouldn't do that and me and my husband appreciate her work ethic. Please let management know she is a keeper. Give her a raise! Happy holidays!,2

"On the second day of my three day visit in Montreal I was nervous I would leave without tasting any of my beloved poutine. n nA friend was going to Frite Alors down the street and offered to bring back some for me.

"Avoid like the plague! n nWent with five girls for a economical brunch before hitting the pool slots. Everything was terrible about this place so bad that I made a severe mental note to warn THE OTHERS on Yelp before they made this tragic mistake. n nWe ordered our meals and a few of us ordered coffees. The waitress came on the other side of the table and told my cousins to ""slide those coffees over there will ya "" to me and my sister. Totally rude. Then, she said ""the bread is getting toasted it's coming "" after we asked where the bread was. Ten minutes later she comes out and says ""oh there actually was no bread but here! take this garlic bread instead "". n nThe garlic bread was literally seeped in a garlic broth and microwaved, so my sister was the only one with balls to ask for just bread and butter instead. When the waitress came back, chunks of butter were thrown onto untoasted white bread. Ridic. n nI'm not one to complain, but I usually LOVE Denny's and have never had an issue with it back home. The meals we got were literally slapped onto the plate, half assed, and small. This Denny's made my heart die a little inside. n nWaitresses never refilled our coffee, disappeared, and we had to go to the kitchen to find someone to pay our bill. n n nTip had the shape of a donut.

"Stayed at Vdara this time for our annual Vegas trip and it was really hard to find a late night dining option after 11pm in City Center area. We were shocked how difficult it was to find something open! I should have checked the Yelp reviews first, but with the limited options, we strolled into Cafe Vettro around midnight. Waited forever to be seated, was told to step out of line because we were a large party of 10. Then service was horrible and food was just okay. Our group mostly had desserts, which were severely marked up, along with the other overpriced items on the menu. Also, an Orange Juice was 7! WTF! Waited a good 20 minutes for our bill and had to resort to asking for a manager. Spoke to the manager and complained about the service manager ended up bringing over the check without offering any sort of discount or compensation for our bad experience.

The customer service at this particular Walgreens is horrendous from both the checkout counter to the pharmacy. Never have I experienced such a lackluster attitude towards customers. I'm generally a fan of Walgreens but I will drive the extra mile to avoid this particular Walgreens.,1
Still great. Bought the Rolando's special breakfast burrito this morning. Asked him to cut it in half. I ate the first half with their homemade green sauce for breakfast and will eat the second half for dinner. It's that big for 5.,2
"Caveat 1 My wife and I consider hotel rooms to be bases of operations when on vacation we have moderate expectations. nCaveat 2 I understand the mission of Vegas hotels is to have you in the casino as much as possible. n nWith that in mind, this hotel did not impress me very much. One of the major issues I had with the room is that it is totally lacking something most people absolutely need these days electric outlets. We travel with cell phone, iPod, laptop, and Kindle chargers and there was not a single spare, accessible outlet to be had. We had to unplug a lamp and the clock. When I wanted to use the computer, I literally had the power cord stretched all the way across the room to the LAN outlet becaus there was no wifi. n nBesides that, the room was comfortable enough with what we needed but a coffee maker would have been nice or perhaps a comfortable chair to sit in. Sparse would be one word that comes to mind. n nMy other major issue is with the Wyndham people. There are at least 2 or 3 of them at every entrance trying to offer you a gift or tickets to listen to their sales pitch. Some are quite annoying but they never stop! They're far worse than the people handing out the ""Girls Direct to You "" cards on the sidewalk. Worse still, Harrah's seems to be the only one. We went to most of the hotels on the strip and did not see similar people hounding you. n nThe saving grace of this hotel is the Piano Bar. That place is great for the music, the atmosphere, and the drinks. It was a lot of fun with some great music and crowd singing. n nOverall the place just needs an overhaul and modernization. So many other hotels nearby seem to have similar deals but are far more interesting on the inside.",1
"Service is slow and our waiter wasn't friendly. nI ordered the fresh fruit platter with granola and yogurt. I was really disappointed because all I got were a few slices of cantaloupe, honey dew, pineapple, few grapes and one kiwi. Considering strawberries, blueberries and raspberries were in season, there could of been more variety. nMy boyfriend is more of an eggs and bacon type of guy, so lets just say his white toast was the best part of his meal. nDefinitely not worth the price, so we will likely not go here again.",1
"Update Name seems changed. No idea whether it's new management and new menu. n n n nHave some layers to take off because this restaurant is hot, temperature wise. n nPortions are extremely generous and prices very reasonable. The service is OK, though one is well advised to check the wait staff actually note down the detail of what you said. e.g. I want the sake hot, please. Yup, hot. n nOsaka is a very unpretentious place which prides itself in serving you good food at a good price. And for that they earn some four well deserved stars.",2
"The service here was horrible! We waited in the bar for 5 min before even being acknowledged. Once the bartender saw we were standing there, she went to go check her cell phone before coming to say hello or take our order. Seriously? We were there at around 4 30pm on a Tuesday. They had no happy hour specials, we paid 4 bucks for about 25 French fries. It was pathetic. We will never go back.",1
"This place has horribly salty food. I felt so robbed of my taste buds and regard for fine dining. WTF? Is all I could possibly chant over and over in my head. Biting my tongue until it was brining in the sodium caked dog food they call ravioli, hamburger helper they call homemade orecchiette, smear of grits they call polenta, and the shreds of chicken thigh they call rabbit ragu. The only dish that I tasted to be decent at best was the spaghetti and one pound lobster, at least cooked to satisfaction in a balanced sauce. There was lacking of honesty in the dishes that left me questioning how they could get away with it. Presentation was uninspired, a blop of food on a flat white plate. The ambiance was dreary with low lights in a room heavily decorated with woods and repeated wine bottles. nI have no qualms to pay for dishes prepared for finer dining with quality ingredients and to taste that amazes me. This fell so disappointingly short. Worse part was that I felt really sorry for the staff to have to deal with such wishy washy foods. They tried to accommodate. So sorry it didn't work out. and NO, it is not an acquired taste, it was just awful.",1
"Niiicccceeee. n nWe went to the dayclub. Walked right through with a presale ticket. My bartender was real attentive and was gorgeous to boot. Good looking crowd. n nEverybody was super cool.

One D Bag tried to get me kicked out his section, until he realized I was walking to a friends that I knew. The security guard just nodded to me and said, ""Yeah, I know.

"First of all, dealing with Pink Spot has been one of the most pleasant experiences I have ever dealt with as far as any online transactions. They are helpful, quick in responses, friendly, and downright professional. They go out of their way to give you the best customer service they can! n nStarted vaping a few months ago through a local brick and mortar store in Los Angeles, but I wasn't impressed with the flavors available at the store. My friends referred me to Pink Spot and strongly urged me to order from there. I was hesitant to order from online since you don't get to try the flavors before you commit, like you would at a actual store. But they offer sample packs which are a great value and allows you to try all the flavors you want, it's a no brainer and worth the risk. I actually ordered 3 sample packs and pretty much got one of every flavor I wanted to try, which is almost all the flavors that Pink Spot offers. Trust me, there's A TON of flavors offered which really impressed me of Pink Spot. I put in the order and received my shipment within 2 business days, again very impressed and satisfied. They even threw in a free sample of another flavor I didn't even order! Not to mention wrote a personal hand written note on my invoice thanking me for my business! Classy, personal, and just makes you feel appreciated as a customer. Now why can't all businesses be like Pink Spot? n nHonestly I've had it for a week now, only have gone through 5 flavors so far. I have 15 more to go! I won't review all the flavors because it's really a personal thing and preference to each person. I can't say I've loved every flavor yet, but so far they are all tasty, strong, not watered down, and you can taste the quality in the liquids. The flavors I do like, I'm in love with, so keep an open mind and try all the flavors! Also some flavors you might not like at first, but keep vaping them, you might grow to love them! Thanks Pink Spot, I will definitely order my refills from you guys only! Your prices are definitely cheaper than any stores locally, which is awesome! Ordering from online is just the way to go!",2
"So I went to a late lunch with the Moms this weekend. n n One plopped me out and the other is her BFF that's been around long before I was doing boom boom and creating crayon masterpieces on the wall. n nThey wanted salads somewhere downtown. And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free LoLo's collard don't count , Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on. n nSo Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination. n n Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have ""judged a book by its cover, "" since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials. n nSo I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth. n nEasy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face. n nIt was salad time. n nNow if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort. n nIs Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad. n nI'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. Aside from its uses as filler see Navajo tacos and garnish. n nAnybody want to join my one woman campaign?",1
"I ate lunch here yesterday, and it was fantastic. I don't know what all is in their meat marinades, but they have a little extra something that I haven't tasted at any other Greek restaurant. Their meats are SO flavorful and delicious. I got the Mediterranean chicken salad, my mom had a beef gyro sandwich, and we got an order of dolmas. It was a little bit pricey, but the food was really good. I will be back.",2
"Really nice location and beautiful patio. Crab cake benedict is great as well is the frozen hot chocolate but the service leaves much to be desired. Granted there was a computer issue, it seems like nothing was timely.",1
"Went here for restaurant week. It was 30 per person for an app, entree and dessert. I know it was a 'deal' but 30 for dinner for one person is not cheap. And given the very, very limited choices for the deal I did expect normal sized portions. They were small and I left hungry. n nI had some potato soup that tasted ok. Nothing amazing or anything. It was luke warm in a boiling lava hot, very shallow bowl, so half the time was spent trying to figure out how to tilt the bowl to get a spoonful without blistering my fingers. I think they were hoping the super hot dish would heat up the soup. It did. kinda. Some bites were barely warm and some bites burnt my tongue. n nFor my entree I had the salmon. It was overcooked, dry and crunchy around the edges with zero seasoning. It was one of the most bland things I've ever eaten. It was sitting on some weird avocado puree which also had no flavor. The tiny side salad was good. quinoa and a lemon vinaigrette dressing with arugula. n nThe dessert was an apple bread pudding which was dry and tiny. About 4 bites. It did taste good though, I just wish I wasn't still hungry after 30 worth of food. n nThe service was good, and almost over the top. The water glasses, like the potion sizes, are tiny, so every time I would take a sip the bus boy would be right there topping it off. Every time. It was weird. Maybe if their water glasses were larger than 8 oz literally , my glass wouldn't look half empty after one sip. n nI'll not be returning. n nThe only saving grace was the ambiance of the place. It was warm and cozy.",1
"The wait time is horrible , being close to the strip doesn't help but it is unreal. The urgent care is under staff and from what it seems overwork . On the plus side it is clean but there is no plus given for the time you lose.",1
"It got a two star because the food wasn't out of a can. n nI called in to the hotel concierge at 7 30 to get a reservation ASAP having already walked by and seen it was pretty much empty. The soonest available was 9 30, so we took it. Well there were plenty of seats open, just none of them were open to people till 9 30?!?! nAnyways, we sit down and I order a drink almost immediately which was promptly forgotten. I got my drink last.mind you everyone ordered drinks 5 minutes after I did and got theirs first, which still took 10 minutes to get. We also ordered oysters from a bus boy who said he was assisting the waiting but for some reason NEVER told ANYONE about the oyster order. So after about 15 minutes and having to flag the waiter down and even asking for bread, which was basically store bought crap biscuits, we put our order in. About 30 minutes later, after asking where the food was, it finally showed up. nOne thing they don't tell you is that it takes 25 minutes for the food to come out.I didn't know microwaves took that long. The only thing that came out before I could finish asking for it was the bill. Crap Service Crappier experience. Go to McDonalds in the food court and get the fish sandwich for a better experience. n nFood 7 nDrink 3 nService 8",1

"Just walked into the Beat Fremont area in Downtown Vegas. Something tells me this is a very cool place, and I was right! Cappuccino and vege pizza on baguette, I feel home right away, in this very unhomely town.

"Very honest and trustworthy mechanic! As a female I know how mechanics can take advantage of us but Andre is such an honest mechanic! I've taken my car, a 2002 Toyota Camry in on multiple occasions and he only does what is needed. Back in 2012 my engine light went off and 2 solenoid panels needed to be repaired. Andre was not comfortable with repairing this part of the transmission so he recommended me to go to a transmission specific shop AND he never charged me for the diagnostic check to boot!

"Let me start by saying I had a salesman named John and he is the only reason this review is not a one. If anything he was charming enough that I didn't actually call the owner of the store. I accompanied my wife today to purchase a Pandora charm bracelet and some charms to go with it. John was nice enough to take time helping us, and showing us many charms and bracelet styles. Now as my wife was questioning John about the 140 package they had advertised and the free charm they had advertised for spending 100 dollars, in comes the ""Manager. "" There was talk of the chain lengths being too long for the 140 package. This made no sense, since the cost of the chain was the same no matter the size. However, the manager was going to swap the wifes chain size for the ""packaged "" one well how nice for us. Then, after we picked our charms, we were asked what charm we wanted for free out of the charms we chose. I asked why this mattered, we chose 2 charms one comes with the package and one is free as advertised. The price should be the same either way. The manger decides she is going to lecture me on how business works, and how most businesses would not give the more expensive charm for free, but I could already tell from the total she was about to tell me how she had done us this great big favor. So I began explaining to her that in the past I had also been a manager, was well aware of how business works, explained the principle of acceptable loss. I.E. It's much better to take a 5 dollar loss to make a 185 dollar sale with an almost guaranteed chance of having a repeat customer that also drums up word of mouth positive advertisement, then losing a 190 dollar sale and having someone slam you on YELP. However, the whole conversation was MUTE because either way the price should have been the same. Anyway, as I am, explaining to this person who has now made the overall process 10 minutes longer, by getting involved in the sale in the first place, this "" manager "" turned her back on us and told John to finish us up. YOU NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON A CUSTOMER, all this lady did was take a fun experience and make it awkward and hateful. The best advise I could give this woman is if you plan to stay in retail sales, take off those ridiculous heels and put on a smile. Your overall attitude is soul crushing in a place that is supposed sell tokens of love, joy, and happiness. Secondly, think about taking some courses from Dale Carnegie, it would do you wonders and probably raise your profit margin.",1
First time going here tonight and have to say it was good but have had much better. Seen on the food network to get the Rosa and it was OK but not as good as they made it sound. Also tried the Margarita was also OK good sauce but nothingi mpressive. If you want great pizza go to Spinatos its absolutely the best. Also the sizes. Are small so if your hungry get two. All in all its good but you'll have to wait 2 hours for pizza that tastes a lot like the restaurant Sauce.,1
"Two large pies, one cheese and one pepperoni. 25 wings 45. n nJust got back from New York last week and missed the pizza. As a New Yorker I must say the pizza was not good for the money. Dry wings didn't help either. Oh well.I guess they tried. Sorry.no second chance for that price and quality.",1
"My boss and I came here for an extremely quick lunch while we were in the area. I was excited because I have heard good things, and I was not disappointed. n nWe arrived on a Friday around 3 p.m. The place was pretty empty, a few people were at the bar. We had an attentive waitress who was very nice. We both got a half sandwich half soup lunch combo with the portabella sandwich their daily special and the broccoli cheese soup. The sandwich was amazing it was warm and full of flavor with brown bread. The soup was good, but a strange and almost gritty texture. I still liked it though. n nThe decor here is very chic and very Middleton Hills. I like the Middleton Hills vibe, so this was a fun treat. I would love to come back for brunch or for dinner and drinks.",2
Usually I would rate them 4. Service is always crappy but the good is always great. Well tonight we sat for 34 minutes without anyone checking in us. I finally grabbed someone and asked them to check our food and then the server magically appeared and said he hadn't forgot about us. At about 45 minutes they brought some of our food and some wrong food so we walked out.,1
"If you're a vegetarian, do not eat here. The tofu tasted like charcoal and the rest of the ingredients in the bowl were bland. It was probably one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. n nWe ordered spring rolls with tofu and they gave us chicken and then complained about the fact that we had to send it back and they had to remake it. The staff made fun of us in the back for the whole duration of our meal. One of my favorite lines was ""I'm tired of having to remake things for vegetarians. "" I'm sorry, but if you offer vegetarian options, you better not complain when you screw up. n nThe only plus side to this was the manager. She was very nice and personable though we had to get her ourselves because the waitresses refused to do so. n nWhen vegetarian options are added, the staff should expect to serve many vegetarian customers and should be professional about it, not making fun of us to where we can hear it. They further complained after one waitress spilled water all over us and some of the food when we asked for replacement bowls. n nThis place is bad, not worth the money or time. It made everyone in my group sick, even those that eat meat, and is an overall horrible place.",1
Don't go on a weekday. The food took a long time to come out even though they weren't very busy. It took almost 15 minutes just to receive a beer that was ordered before the food. Meal was lukewarm and completely unseasoned. They sang happy bday to my husband then charged for the ice cream. This was sad. I still tipped the waitress. She tried to be attentive even though without food to serve it was awkward at times.,1
"Had a pedi and gel mani done by Tina and they were both great. Such a relaxing massage on my legs and feet and loved the hot stone rubdown too. My manicure looks great too, no bubbles left behind and Tina even took out some tool I'd never seen before and kind of filed the side of my nails to make sure any excess was removed. Can't wait to come back!",2
"What has happened to the Bellagio dining options?!?!?!?!?!? This used to be my favorite Vegas buffet. If going definitely do not go for lunch as the selection is terrible. n nLunch menu salad bar, shrimp, a few random dried out entree choices. n nThere is no dim sum and no crab legs at lunch! Rather disappointing.",1
Too expensive for the burger. Rather eat at Red Robin. More for your money,1
"It's hard to find fault in a place with a happy hour that is so good the most expensive item on our check was the iced tea. n nEven logging onto their website puts me back into that ethereal frame of mind that is District American Kitchen and Wine Bar. The style and laid back atmosphere that is this destination on the corner of 3rd Street and Van Buren is replicated by the design and music on their website. This is by far my favorite downtown Happy Hour, with smooth DJs keeping the mood going but allowing for patrons to network, laugh, and have a great experience and escape from the heat of the city. n nLots of loose ties, heels delicately hanging from toes, and ""whew I made it through another workday "" conversations all around. Start with the White Peach Sangria and join the conversation. I highly recommend the hummus and wings for light snacks before hitting up the real menu for five star salads and dynamite crab cakes. n nBeing only a couple of blocks from the Convention Center allows for a great meeting place after a long day on the show floor. For more hearty affairs go for the NY Steak and White Cheddar Potato Gratin and definitely add the Garlic Spinach as a side. n nSecret Tip Each entree has a wine listed to pair with your meal to experience the full effect. n nCheers!",2
"Kind of over rated. The food isn't stellar for how much it costs. Go there mostly for the ambiance and professional service. A good date place but you won't be raving over the food. n nHowever, lunch is a good deal here since the meals are in the 7 11 dollar range and there is quite a range of dishes.",1
"I am not impressed with this Moe's restaurant! There was old food dripped around the edges of the food bar, and I saw the employees push the old food back into the fresh food instead of cleaning it up and throwing it away. The salsa bar is also never full and rarely clean. The management needs to get a handle on this restaurant! I understand it is fairly new, but the employees and managers really could do a better job maintaining cleanliness. I live in fort mill and I pass by this Moe's to go to the Rock Hill location because the food is fresher and the staff is more organized and friendlier. I was really excited for the Fort Mill Moe's to open, but I do not want to spend anymore money there until the service picks up. They're are a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Fort Mill and Moe's has a lot to compete with. I love Moe's so I really hope this location steps their game up!",1
Rodrizio was great! I would definitely go there again. Take a coupon because it is pricey. Nice atmosphere for a date or special occasion.,2
"Still find this to be my only local source for hard to find Asian treats. In fact this store was a ""bribe "" to have my daughter fully clean her room, closet, under the bed etc. An actual full cleaning so she could get her snacks from Lee Lees. nSince I am half Chinese, my daughter has grown to love the Asian snacks and foods from here. So if you are in the area for something different or ingredients for your Korean, Japanese, Chinese, etc. dish make a stop here. nI do wish it had an on site bakery, would love fresh baked goods, but that would really make it a one stop shop for my cravings. Enjoy.",2
"Standard, good Middle Eastern food. My date described the server as being ""le serveur qui nous a bien fait rire "". I really felt for the guy because I understood that he wasn't clueless out of any bad emotion.",1

"This review is solely for Boston Cream. n nThis is my favorite flavor at other establishments. I really like the donut, the pie, just everything. However, this flavor? Total let down. It was too sweet and did not have a good cream flavor. Making cream flavored ice cream and adding chocolate does not make it Boston Cream. The effort was there but the execution was sad.",1
"We were starving one night and thought we would try this place out, not the best idea we had. The food is gross and over priced, and the service is bad. The only thing that we liked was the band. n nThis might be an alright place to have a drink but don't eat here.",1
 74 for 2 adults and 2 children my burger was not cooked bun was a week old the whole burger was cold. Kids burger the cheese was so thin it only had one side very disappointing. Non of the buns were heated to toasted . Will not recommend ,1
"L'Amore is a perfect, quiet neighborhood restaurant for everyone who enjoys a quiet atmosphere, excellent food at reasonable prices.

"I like it. Though I only had a pot of tea it was a wonderful pot of tea. n nWhen I arrived on a Tuesday 13 30 I was a little unsure where I was allowed to sit as quite a few 'reserved' signs were up on tables. I got assigned a nice table beside the entrance. nI was supplied a menu with their food and their Teas listed they do other drinks too of course, coffee, juices and the likes . n nI asked the girl who handed me the menu what she'd recommend for someone like me that drinks Earl Grey mostly, she was showing me their varieties of the different Earl Grey mixtures they carry. Then out of left field she recommended their Royal Darjeeling. nI agreed to try that and was pleasantly surprised! It was brought out in a pot for one 4 Servings with a 3 minute sand timer yellow and some milk. n nAfter brew time was finished I poured and drank. It was perfect! Not too hot or cold. It was delightful and I was actually quite taken by it. n nThis was a nice visit and although I paid u00a32.60 for a pot it was worth it. n nI deducted a star as I found the overall atmosphere a bit chilled and not so efficient. nDifficult to pinpoint, but I noticed a few food drink spills and drops when service took place. n nI will visit again though!",2
The appetizers were tasty and not boxed frozen product which was nice. My fat kid was hopeful that the food would have been just tasty so imagine my disappointment when the food came out room temperature. n nI ordered the Combo dinner with pulled pork and pulled chicken. As my sides I chose coleslaw and mac and cheese. The coleslaw was almost warm and the flavor profile wasn't anything to blow my skirt up. The mac and cheese tasted like Velveeta with some spices. It was barely warm. The chicken was very dry and crunchy as if it had been sitting around. The pulled pork was dry as well. All of it was room temperature. n nThe place could use a good cleaning and dusting as well. n nI won't be back though I will say I think they might just have a consistency issue. My husband's good was warmer.,1
"I want to start by saying good food, very clean and the staff was very nice. n nBUT. When you own a business you must make sure there is not ""painful payment "" for your customers . For starters they do not accept debit or credit.only cash or checks.yes checks, who writes those any more? They offer you the ATM in the lobby that charges 2.50 to use plus the fee that your bank charges to use a n ATM that is not owned by your bank. So right out of the gate you are paying around 5 just to pay them for your food, if you didn't bring cash. Also when you place your order and pay you are then sent around to the drink department, where you pay again. Why not just collect the full amount when you place an order. n nAlso when we went I went with ONE friend. The seating there is for large groups and if you are in a small group you are forced to sit with strangers. It could be a little awkward. n nI guess the over all review is this. Great food but HORRIBLE set up. You can tell just from they way they conduct business that ownership is trying to nickle and dime you.",1
"Went this evening for dinner with my boyfriend, our 5 year old daughter, and a friend. We checked out the deli first before dinner. It reminded me of my favorite deli back home with all the fresh meats, cheeses, pastas, and desserts. AH MAZING! We then headed into the restaurant and were seated right away. Our server was professional, friendly, and attentive I think her name was Gloria . Food was awesome! We ordered calamari, a small Caesar salad, rigatoni bolognese, fettucine alfredo, a cheese pizza for our daughter, and some crazy pasta with scallops, lobster, and shrimp. Everything tasted fresh with the right amount of seasoning, and it was all hot! We were expecting to pay around 13 for the pizza as that was the price listed on the menu, but were very surprised to see our server only charged 5 for a kids pizza. Thanks! We then went to the deli and ordered desserts to take home. We just finished dessert and everything was surprise delicious! nEverything was fantastic and we'll definitely be back!",2
"I came on a Monday. They were out of veal and steak. My dish was the spicy sausage rigatoni which good, not great. My wife had the shrimp pasta Alfredo. Disappointing! Sauce was plain. Turns out the sauce is already shipped here and they don't add any more spices to it. The shrimp tasted like the store bagged ones. Their bread was delicious. The mozzarella fritti was less than ok. Staff was welcoming. The reason i gave it a 2 was because my dish was OK but my wife's dish was just not good. The Kraft's macaroni n cheese taste a lot better. Also, they were out of two main meats. Will not come back, unless i don't find a better Italian food. Im from Santa Barbara and have travelled all over the world and the states. By the way, my daughter ordered a pizza, which she says she enjoyed.",1
"This is a hidden gem. I met with Joe, the owner, and he is trying to build a niche shop, which is very exciting. Awesome small but growing whiskey selection. Nice respected wine labels.

This place has potential, and Joe's attitude is right where it should be. n nI can't wait to see how this progresses. n n5 stars for the attitude and potential.",2
Delicious indian food you can find near the strip. Me and my husband simply love the buffet. I like having South Indian breakfast items with chicken curry . So I took a serving of hot hot made upma with butter chicken curry WOWW is the word ! nI was so so so happy with the food that .I badly wanted to leave a great feedback on yelp. Hence created my yelp account. Isn't it crazy. Food Gandhi definitely has that impact.,2
"Overall, the food was pretty good here, but the dishes were waaaay expensive. nI tried this place with a group of friends. We liked the food but each dish wasn't fulfilling. You'd probably have to spend 50 100 to satisfy yourself.",2
Not really sure what the hype is about this bakery. the concept is lovely but the cupcakes are dry and the icing is nothing to get excited about. I've sampled the vanilla and chocolate and once tried a raspberry bread. All dry dry dry. won't go back,1
"I'm happy we have a second H M and I'm happy this one isn't so filled with business clothes or clothes of a genre one might dime 'heroine chic' or maybe that's just me . This new H M has most of their lines, lots of everyday clothes cute tops, skirts, sexy dresses and some more casual things too as well as some business wear not to mention the cute bikinis and lingerie lingerie is always my weakness . I'd love it if H M opened a third location a little farther south. Maybe in the Chandler mall?",2
"One of the biggest disappointments of my 40th birthday weekend in Vegas. Yes, the patio and fountain show are great and fun. But it's soo expensive to have mediocre food and terrible service. Not only was the wait staff terrible, but the hostess was annoying and full of herself. Hey, I didn't make her become a hostess!? Wouldn't recommend and I'm shocked to read the positive reviews!",1
"After all the hype about this place, I came there with high expectations. Boy I couldn't have been more disappointed. n nOur server was nice enough and very attentive, but when that is the best part of the experience, it's not good. My girlfriend and I both order various forms of their Bacon Cheeseburger. I ordered mine to be cooked medium and it came out well done. My girlfriend ordered her burger medium well and it came out medium rare. I decided to just go ahead and eat my burger, while she decided to send it back and have it cooked longer. n nThe amount of grease that was dripping off both our burgers was too much for us. We both ended up eating almost half of our burgers out of pure hunger more than anything else. I was really shocked at the quality of burger from a ""burger bar "". The fries were decent. n nThe restaurant itself has a pretty cool look to it, but it is very loud, almost like you are in a school cafeteria. I'm not quite sure where all the hype comes from for this place? It comes off as a desperate attempt to be the cool local burger joint that everyone thinks is cool to say they go there. n nThere are numerous places, not only on East blvd, but in the greater Charlotte area that I would recommend to get a burger. n nMaybe it was just a one time bad experience, but like my rating says. ""eek! me thinks not. """,1
"The location is very convenient for me as it is 4 blocks from work. n nOn Mondays they have a kids sing and dance activity at 10 AM, which is a lot of fun. n nThey have a good selection of books, music CDs, and DVDs. n nThey also have drive thru drop off and pick up.",2
"I freaking LOVE mojo yogurt. Seriously. I go there with my daughter about once a week. She doesn't even ask for ice cream anymore, she just asks if we can go to Mojo Yogurt, and who am I to deny anyone of love in a cup. n nPlus its always surprise to go and find out what flavors they will have each week. I know you can look them up online, but I like to be surprised. I've been extremely partial to the fruity flavors lately, like the passion fruit, the coconut and the apple.omg the apple was SO good! n nService is always very friendly and you should DEFINITELY follow them on twitter mojoyogurt. Trust me you should. n nSo yeah, if you haven't tried out Mojo, you really should. Right now. Go.",2
I had high expectations it was a quaint little joint however I was disappointed and would not go back. The pork was tender but had ZERO flavor. The rosemary risotto tasted like rice with cream of chicken soup I could have better at home. n nEric started out nice enough but was a jerk by the end of the night.,1
"SLS STAY THE F CK AWAY n nWhat, the acronym doesn't match? Well, it doesn't f cking matter, because you should avoid this place like the f cking plague. n nHere is a too long list of things that went wrong during our less than 48 hours stay n n1. The elevator in the attached parking structure broke down TWICE for extended periods of time. n n2. LiFE Nightclub didn't let anyone in until about 11 30 Friday night despite a HUGE line outside because of an isolated power outage. n n3.

Despite all of the above, it still took me and my dad hours of bitch mayhem at the front desk to get our ridiculous 28 night resort fee waived. n n5. Housekeeping was EXTREMELY cheap. Used up toiletries were NOT replaced the second day. n nI would give this place zero stars if Yelp allowed it. But since I'm forced to give it at least one star, I will say that the hotel rooms do have cool illuminated infinity mirrors. But that's it. n nWhere other companies implode old hotels and rebuild something new and magnificent, SBE only slightly remodeled the old Sahara. n nNEVER AGAIN.",1
"Great restaurant for a large group, modern and fun atmosphere, great food and drinks. Went for my birthday and wasn't disappointed. Take your time, try the tartares as an appetizer which are excellent. Best night is a Saturday for a meal and great place to party after. Enjoy!",2
"CLOSED n nUgh! Banging. My. Head. On. My. Steering wheel! n nWhat is up with trying to get a bite to eat in Middleton? First I went to Palmyra. It was closed for good. As I was Yelping on my phone, I saw a local guy and he recommended Tapas Rias. So I drove here to Tapas Rias and guess what? It was closed for good. n nNext I go to the gas station to fill up and I ask another local what he recommends. He said the buffet at the grocery store Copps Food Center was great and Imperial Garden has the best Chinese food around. So I pretended to sound interested since he was kind enough to talk with me. However, a grocery store buffet and chinese food.in Middleton? That's the best a local could offer? But it got better. As he gave me directions to Imperial Garden, he explained that the restaurant was attached to a gas station. UGH! No thank you! n nNow I'm frustrated AND hungry and I'm just trying to find some decent food to bring back to the hotel for me and my husband. n nSo on my way to Imperial Gas station.I mean Garden. I drive by Crandall's. This place looked like it had good food. Unfortunately, they are closed on Sunday. After Yelping a bit more, I looked up Captain Bill's. I wasn't necessarily looking to spend a lot of money, but it sounded good and I was in the area. I passed it up a couple times, but once I found it, there was a sign on the door ""open 5 PM to Close "". Well.it was almost 3 PM. Is this for real people. I had nothing to eat today. How can this be? n nThank God for Yelp. I starting Yelping again and looked up more reviews in the Middleton area. That's when Mharaja Restaurant came up. I called immediately to find out if they were open.for the day.or at all for that matter. The man who answered the phone explained that they close at 3 PM. It was 2 51 PM and he was kind enough to wait for me to get there. I ordered way too much food but it was pretty decent. n n I would have rather had tapas, but as you can see from my photo, it will soon be a little Mexican restaurant called Cocina Real.",1
"I'd rather gouge my eyes out with real syringes and throw all my money at the ghost of Pat Robertson than give another dollar to this bar that serves just juice cocktails. Okay, okay, the music is ok. Stars for music but no stars for the bar. And thank you to the person who have out the glow in the dark bracelets. Star for that, too.",1
"Very spacious 700 sq ft room and 3 people comfortably can stay in one as the 3rd guest can sleep on the couch. Front desk is courteous and prompt. Loved the shower. Bathtub's about 5 ft long. n nHere are the lousy parts phone in room doesn't work, living room TV doesn't work even with batteries in the remote , remote for bedroom TV lacked batteries, towels were flaking off fuzzies all over my sister's hair and skin.",2
They operate as sparkelets so I have had to do 2 reviews as they are liars they hide under the ds waters name PLEase read my sparklets review BUT I Stress they suck don't call pick anyone else but them,1
"Really mediocre bland pizza. Overly thick crust for wood fired. Every ingredient, from crust to cheese to toppings to sauce was lackluster and flavorless. On plus side it is clean and decorated in an inoffensive modern manner. Recommend against. Go to Pomo nearby instead.",1
"For a concept that could've been hokey, touristy and overdone, Tommy Bahama's Restaurant is the exact opposite tasteful and fantastically executed. They really make you feel like you are sitting in an island paradise. The service is fantastic and the food is even better. n nWe had a ton of stuff, but the highlights for me were definitely the scallop sliders and the Sanibel chicken. The sliders were an awesomely unique concoction, with a perfectly seared scallop served on a toasted buttery brioche bun with a chipotle aioli that was the perfect glue for this mini sandwich, providing a welcome richness and heat that tied the entire thing together. I could easily eat a meal of four of these. The sanibel chicken was another killer presentation. A butterflied chicken breast, breaded with panko and baked to perfection while leaving the meat nice and moist. They stuffed the breast with just a enough cheese to give you a creamy texture without being overwhelming. The whole thing is surrounded by a delightful red pepper cream sauce, and served with some haricot verts and TB's chive mashed potatoes. n nThis meal was awesome. Go here, and you will not be disappointed.",2
"Wonderful group of guys. I wanted to try out this one bike that no one had. Sure, all of them could have special ordered it for me but all of them said ""you'd have to buy it then "" so I called these guys up and they were going to order it for me without commitment! Since they were not sure of the size, one of the workers actually brought his wife's bike for me to size and try it out. n nI ended up buying another bike that they didnt carry however I bought my boyfriends bike from them because of their excellent service. I also will get my bike serviced by them instead because they are not all fancy and superficial. They are down to earth guys that will give you the time of day and is NEVER TOO BUSY FOR YOU! n nThis bike shop is 30 minutes away from me, and trust me when I need a bike serviced this is where i'd go. 30 Minutes is worth it.",2
"I also only chose this place based on its high reviews on Yelp. Now I have been to several Mexican restaurants and I have to say this place is not bad at all. I mean its not excellent but pretty good overall. The rice and beans were tasteless but the tacos I had were delicious and the chips and salsa were great. I could drink beers and eat their chips salsa all night. n nThe service was awesome, I never had to ask for a refill or more salsa or wait for anything. I was a little cautious because of its location and the way it looked outside but I am glad I tried it out. n nFriendly, Good food and very affordable!",2
"The tightly packed and gloomy setting of the rather pricey Golden Restaurant on rue St. Laurent was my favorite Indian restaurant until I was told about Sweet Malhi. n nMy taste buds were immediately overwhelmed with flavor and aroma of their delicious entrees and main dishes, their Naan bread was most excellent! Don't let the attitude of the waiter bother you, he probably works for a low salary. Bright atmosphere and the Taj Mahal beer on tap.yummmm! n nThis is the real deal for amazing and inexpensive Indian food in Montreal.",2
"I do not appreciate rude employees and bad customer service, but at least I get to let it out on YELP! n nI have been ""told off "" for bringing in international packages. Twice now, the cashier has yelled out to everyone in the line waiting behind me that because I brought in some packages that need to be sent off overseas, they all have to wait longer! Wait, what? I thought I was paying you for a service. n nMost of the employees here are extremely slow at entering information. Twice in the middle of a transaction their computers have shut down.and they had to re enter EVERYTHING all over again. Oh and once their Credit Card machine failed at the end of a transaction.all they could do was ask me to pay cash for it. Yes, the air conditioning system seemed not to be working a few times during the summer, which makes standing in line for 30 40 minutes unbearable. n nI will say it is convenient because it is right off the 101 and Cave Creek. They do have a couple really nice and competent employees too, but that is about it.",1
"Eines der teureren Buffets in Las Vegas, aber wir wollten uns mal das Bellagio mit seiner wunderbaren Blumenwelt anschauen und sind dann auch zum Buffet. Die Auswahl und die Qualit u00e4t der angebotenen Speisen ist wirklich hervorragend. Ich habe mir u00f6fter von dem wahnsinnig zarten Kobe Rind geholt. Das war leider so gut, dass ich mich entgegen meiner sonstigen Gepflogenheiten nicht durch alles durchprobieren konnte, da meine Aufnahmef u00e4higkeit bereits vorher zu Ende war.",2
"Nice place. Very clean Free wifi! But very bad drinks. Got a thai tea boba, and they might as well given me the tea from the bottle at ranch market.",1
This place was amazing! Service was great and the food even better ! It was our first time but it is our new favorite. It has the small intimate family owned feel and the meat is top quality. The food combined with the great service left us very impressed,2
"The best Chinese buffet I have found in town. That being said, chinese buffets are not very healthy or high in quality in general. nWhen your looking for a self indulgent 10 chinese lunch this is the place!",2
"Why is this listed far away from its actual location. I can't seem to be able to check in here n n nPros nAmbiance, Small Establishment mom and popish. something I support n nCons nProbably everything else. n nThis is my 5th time visiting this place and the only reason for it has been its proximity. The service has always been shoddy subjective . I guess you have to be a regular or catch the owners eye to be given any sort of good service. As for me I got the ""don't care for you "" service even though only 4 tables were occupied during the lunch hour . I guess I must be becoming invisible. n nFood Saw the prices and was a bit surprised asian upper class restaurant? somewhat of an anomaly, easily double of what you get in other Vietnamese restaurants. Thought to myself the food better rock for these prices . Ordered the mint chicken, what I got was a well decorated but bland and not seasoned dish. I had to put in heaps of fish sauce and oyster sauce just to make it palatable. n nWhat a waste of good earned cash and a bad aftertaste to boot. Hopefully in future this review will remind me never to visit this place again.",1
"SSSOOOOO excited to check this place out when I heard they sell Intelligentsia Coffee. I've only been twice two days in a row.heh and was more then happy with both visits. The espresso sells itself, they use Trader Joe's almond milk, free wifi, and the baristas are super friendly and accommodating. The space is quaint, a couple tables and couches, and you can't tell that it's a place that buys gold at all. I even saw a Settlers of Catan game board! n nThe only downfall is that they have no sign, which makes it extremely difficult to find there's only a ""We Sell Gold "" sign out front. However, we were told by the barista that they are in the process of changing signs. n nThis is a must for all coffee lovers in AZ!",2
"After reading extremely positive reviews for this place, I was so hyped to come spend Sunday football here. I also read negative reviews hoped that I wouldn't experience something like that but sadly, here I am writing a 2 star review. n nI've been to a bunch of hole in the walls so I didn't mind the exterior but we walked in to a dark, empty bar I just had an uneasy feeling. Sure it was early but it's Sunday! Where is everyone?! After sitting for a while, I also realized how warm it was in the place that the fan was so loud somewhere in the back. Urgh. n nThere was only one bartender server but she was accommodating friendly. She immediately changed the channel to the game without us asking based on the bf's jersey , which was really nice of her. We received our menus two crumply, stained pages with sharpie markings all over they raised their prices so they crossed out some prices wrote the actual prices in sharpie they crossed off items they don't have anymore . She apologized that they are revamping their menus but damn, would it hurt to at least print their menus nicely on stock paper resume paper just until they get their real menus? n nIt took about 40 or so minutes for a burger 2 breakfast platters. Uhhhh. Didn't get why it took so long the other 2 3 patrons were already eating! While watching the game, a bug crawled up my friend's arm too! Not cool. There were a total of 4 other people who came while we were there they weren't together either. It was awkward I honestly don't understand the positive reviews. n nI had good company plus the food service were okay but I think we will just visit another sports bar for the next game.",1
The food is good but takes for ever the bartenders are so rude and so was the server I asked for ranch for my fries and she said is there anything else I don't want to go back and forth a bunch of times rude rude rude,1
"Unfortunately, our experience didn't live up to the reviews we read. We were the only customers in the restaurant when we walked in. During our entire experience, the owner was sitting across from us and didn't acknowledge the poor service we had. We ordered the pizza and meatball sub since we read all about it on this website. Pizza came out and it was ok. Nothing special. I grew up in NY and it's definitely not close to what you get there. So our next hope was the meatball sub except it never came! Once they brought the pizza out, no one ever came back over to refill drinks, etc. When we finished eating, the waitress finally came over and my husband said ""so I guess we aren't getting our meatball sub? "" She goes oh and walks away, says something to the owner and he says to her ""you took the order "". We ask for our bill and walk out. There was no apology for the oversight from the waitress or the owner. Needless to say, with subpar food and poor service we won't be back. An experience we were looking forward to definitely ended up to be pretty disappointing.",1
"Came in on a slow summer night and it was hotter in here than it was outside. Bugs were flying around everywhere. The beer selection was unimpressive, and the whole place just felt sticky and dirty. n nThe bartender, however, was friendly and especially accommodating considering I had a friend who couldn't speak English trying to place an order. n nGet a better air conditioner in here, and hire a janitor to mop the floor already.",1
See below from Martha . Please make my life easier go somewhere else.,2
The club itself is really nice but my only issue is that You can't freeze your membership over the phone? Seriously what a joke I just had surgery and don't want to pay for something that I can't even participate in. When I expressed this to the manager she laughed at me so when I get back I will be canceling me membership.,1
"I am super disappointed with the new restaurant. I got really excited when I saw the New Times article about it and decided to invite my family to our neighborhoods boat parade dinner at the Watershed. I will preface this with the HOA sending a flyer out to the residents to come watch at the watershed, so it was going to be a busy night. n nWe got a table and after 20 min finally had someone ask us if we wanted something to drink. We ordered an appetizer so that we could look over the menu. In this time, there were about 4 servers who tried to drop things off at our table. It was very clear, no one was properly trained on the seating chart or whoever was running the restaurant has no idea what numbering tables is. n n20 minutes later we had the queso fundido. For 9, I wasn't impressed with the amount of cheese given. Once the cheese got cold, the thin chips could no longer scrape it up off of the skillet. n nWe then waited another 10 minutes for our server to come back around to order more drinks and food. We were quickly told that we could order more drinks but the kitchen was now closed. At 6 30 in the middle of the boat parade. n nBasically we told him this is a joke and that we were done then because we had expected to be eating at this time. He apologized, but no, offering of anything to make us want to come back. n nWhile waiting for our check two servers came by asking if we ordered the food they had. This made us even more upset since we were just told the kitchen was closed. The last girl that came with food, my Mom made very clear that it was ridiculous that there was no food service at 6 30 pm. She said they had not prepared to have this many people come to the restaurant. Out of the 15 tables there was definitely not food at each one, so not sure why they would plan to only feed 5 tables a night. n nWe asked to have our check again and then were told that their system wasn't working. We added up our food tax and got cash out because we were livid at this point. n nOn the way out, we asked for the manager. It happened to be the girl that tried to drop off food at our table. We told her how disappointed we were, especially since we live in the neighborhood. She basically broke down crying and said they would make it up to the community. They still took our money and no hint of wow, we are sorry we basically made your night super sh y, please come back for a free appetizer on us. n nEvery aspect of this restaurant shows me that they have no restaurant or customer service experience. I won't be back bc I would rather spend 15 on an entree somewhere that I know will actually treat me like a customer. n nSide note We left and went to Spokes on Southern, a go to place in the neighborhood that we always enjoy. We sat down, water was instantly brought and had a server within 5 minutes. We joked with them about our horrible night so far and the manager brought us a free appetizer.basically another restaurant tried to make up for the disaster one!",1
"I have been to the Mix Lounge in the past for drinks but this time I decided to go there with two other couples when I was in Las Vegas for business at the end of the April. But not for the view and a great tuna tartar, I would have given the restaurant one star. The service was terrible. The waiter comes to take our tables drink order and skips me completely and then when he delivers the drinks he brings two orders of something someone else had and he said I thought you said you wanted that too. My recommendation is that for these prices go to Alize.",1
"Where to start.huhhhhhh.I had to take our dog here based on the rescue stating so. Immediately ran into disorganization. Secondly, they will hand write visa mc numbers for other vendors cremation which is not stored securely nor is that to be done in such a fashion. I did discuss that with them, and got the SHRUG.I also explained they can be fined 250,000.00 per occurrence. SHRUGGGG. OK. Not a good sign. Each time I went in here, myself and all the other clients were seated outside rooms while they took the animals back, without owners, VERY ODD. No owners went into the rooms, any of the 6 7 times I was there. When this dog had worms when she first arrived they handed her to me and said here you go, give her this once a day for 2 weeks. OK. I get home and it says give 1 dose.period. so i had to call them next day.and she said no it is 1 dose. OK. nProblem number 2.i got 4 puppies who were seen by this vet clinic, after an ok, they were brought to me. I knew immediately they were all sick with something.not good.as they had horrible diarrhea and it smelled horrible, throughout the house. So after NUMEROUS calls, and so much wrong information, I had 2 puppies go back, after call number 3 4 5 one of the girls answering the phone messed up and said, the one puppy had giardia. WHAT and the second dog tested positive WHAT now i still have 2 puppies. they are neg.so i was told .so another 2 weeks go by, i call oh no the 3rd one was positive.the whole time WHAT so i speak with others and have them relocated to a different vet. Surprisingly that vet treated them ONE time and they were then negative.that was 6 dogs total who had been through multiple rounds of meds at West Charleston Animal place, to no avail. I felt like they were onesie twosie ing the rescue, yeah they may get a better price, but if you need to keep doing it again and again and again, with boarding.sounds like a money maker to me! I was so mad, because I have other dogs and they could have gotten very sick from this disorganization! Not to mention 2 weeks of shoveling smelly water poop! DISGUSTING! I did not trust them to spay the rescue puppy i had.,.I have never in all my years of having animals.ever experience such a disorganized HOT MESS!",1
"Sakana is a great alternative to the RAs and Stingrays of Scottsdale. n nTucked in the Indian Bend Hayden plaza, this place is a little less well known and has quite a bit better food than being right in Old Town. You miss a bit of the trendiness of being in the center of it all, but that warrants perks like dressing down flip flops and t shirts are totally acceptable here and paying less. n nCheck out their daily specials for the best deals. Lunchtime also has some hidden gems. n nService here has always been good and the food is flawless.",2
"What a wonderful place. The owner, Mo, is a delightful woman who really loves her business. I was trying to locate on of my favorite flowers, Lilacs and she searched for me over a 2 day period. She found them but was honest, telling me that it is the end of the season and they would only last one day. The variety of flowers is amazing and I love a person who works with passion for her business.",2
"The staff are polite and courteous until you make your purchase. After they have your money they treat you like a second class citizen and blow you off even though your concern is legitimate. n nI purchased a TechTouch massage chair that sells for over 5,000 after taxes. I paid in full. no financing or anything. n nThey sent two delivery men to setup and install the chair. One of them must have been having a horrible day because he was pretty rude to me as well as his coworker. I should mention his eyes were very bloodshot, but he did not smell like drugs or alcohol. n nThey spent roughly an hour setting it up. As soon as they left I inspected the chair and found they didn't even hook the back up correctly. I immediately called the store and asked for them to come back and finish assembly. The rude employee came back in and 1 2 minutes later popped it into place and left without saying a single word. During this visit they damaged my doorway chipped the wood and paint because they didn't have the patience or courtesy to bring it in carefully. Plus, my 5,000 massage chair came brand new with a long streak of paint off of my own door. So not only did they damage my doorway, they also stained the chair. n nAlso worth mentioning is that the delivery men trampled an expensive Turkish rug that was several feet away from the hardwood area where they were assembling the chair. It's almost like they wiped their shoes on it over and over because it's filthy. I bought it 3 days before their arrival so it was brand new until they showed up. I shampooed it for an hour and it's still stained. Thanks, Relax the Back, for trashing my doorway, chair, and new rug. n nI used the chair that night and found the shoulder pads were not functioning. Upon further inspection there was an air hose and 2 electrical connectors dangling from the back that were not connected. I called them again and got another bothered employee. They insisted this was a manufacturer defect. They repeatedly said that some hoses get kinked and that this is causing the shoulders not to work. n nFunny, why WOULDN'T THEY HAVE TOLD ME THIS PRIOR TO MY PURCHASE?. they wanted your money at all costs. After my insisting they come back out and that I see hoses and connectors dangling they finally agreed to send someone out. n nA salesperson came out to repair the chair. He spent 30 minutes or so opening the chair and connecting it. Three days later I noticed there was an issue with the speakers and that they were not operating properly. I again called the store. n nThis time I was told this would be a warranty issue EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD THE CHAIR LESS THAN 10 DAYS and that I would need to contact the manufacturer. again, this shows a lack of service AFTER they got my money. Before then they were accommodating and polite. n nI contacted the manufacturer. They sent a rep to my home to fix the speaker issue. Upon his arrival he noticed hoses running along the side of the chair and he said that is not how the chair should be assembled. Big surprise. Relax the Back failed me again. n nHe replaced the speaker section of the chair and still found the speakers not functioning properly. He then wondered if the issue was in the assembly, which wouldn't surprise me one bit. He had to leave and reschedule so that he could have adequate time to disassemble and reassemble the chair. n nIt is now January 21, only 18 days since the chair was delivered and I'm already experiencing every issue a customer can. n nSpend 10 minutes online comparing prices and you'll see for yourself that they're overpriced. I purchased a Jesper sit stand desk online for 1160 shipped and assembled. Relax the Back charged 2,300 for the very same one! n nDo yourself a favor and STAY AWAY from this place. It will only lead to headaches and high blood pressure. n n nUPDATE 1 31 14 Despite his friendly response below, I want to point out that Chris knew of my situation from the start and didn't do anything to try and resolve it until 2 days ago after reading my negative Yelp review. In fact, he knew I purchased the desk somewhere else for a cheaper price over 2 months ago. I told them right in the store, yet this is the first I'm hearing of a price match or anything of that sort. Funny how he never addressed any of this until my review was seen. n nAlso of note, he has known of the issues with the chair delivery etc., since they first occurred. Unless of course, this happens to all of their customers and he has me confused with another customer whose new chair was setup incorrectly, doorway was damaged, and brand new 1,000 area rug was ruined. I did speak with him this week. They offered to reimburse me the cost of having it cleaned, although I'm skeptical. I will update my review if that happens.",1
"Not impressed at all. Didn't even get a chance to eat because I waited for 6 minutes without being acknowledged by a server. The hostess asks me if I would like a booth or a table, I say booth and she sighs and acts like the world is ending. This place looks like your typical over priced Scottsdale joint with bimbos as waitresses who can't crack a smile. By the way, when did apple juice become as expensive as grey goose? 5 for a glass of juice? Seriously? I could buy two huge jugs of apple juice at costco for 5. I am glad they waitresses didn't serve me, f this place.",1
"So I was little freaked out when I turned up this morning to find talk radio and Sheriff Joe, doing something to do with a book? and the flag? confusing. Anyhow I got the chair I wanted for my husband zero gravity chair which was STILL in stock 2 days after Thanksgiving. and still on sale After a few minutes of being ignored and I looked confused, someone did help me. The downer was they they don't sell any of their bison or elk meet in a refrigerated or frozen form to go and they didn't have any large stainless steel water bottles or lip balm which attached to your key chain, which are two things I was looking for and thought they'd have there. They also didn't have a place where I could pull the car around to load up the chair, so instead I hauled it out to the parking lot. It wasn't too heavy, so all's well that ends well.",2
"Does the owner not understand that this review should help him. Don't criticize people on yelp for having a bad experience at your place. That's suicide, you are one person. We aren't the only ones who had a bad experience. I had 4 people with me. Would you like all them to put their review on here? Learn how to run a business. Also, nothing you did that night dynamically changed on the fly. You had 3 hostess downstairs doing nothing. Put 1 on the roof top patio and then sit people up there. Problem solved.",1
"Well I wanted quantity over quality and I surely got that. The food was so bad. Not just a couple of dishes but everything including the deserts. Every dish was over cooked, not hot, or stale. I bet they reuse a lot of product due to the slow turnover. The staff never greets you or makes you feel at home. Last time I come here.",1
"Great service. Amazing location. Good drinks. A DJ booth in a coffee shop? Oh yea. n nSo this place is pretty much postage stamp sized, but they make up for that with swanky style. They don't offer many ""snacks, but those can be grabbed at the neighboring business Sweet Pea Bakery. They offer indoor and outdoor seating which is so important considering their tiny location. n nYes, it's close to the jail. Yes, a homeless person might walk by. But this is coffee you can walk to before a game event or grab on the way into the office. n nPersonal note I wasn't so into their brownies. They look luscious, but as big as my sweet tooth is, they were too dense and sweet for me. Some folks will love them, just not my thing.",2
"a group of us went to vegas this past weekend for my cousins 30th bday, and we decided to stay at the golden nugget, as the majority of us prefer to stay downtown. i was really looking forward to staying at this hotel because of the generally positive reviews i have read via yelp and yahoo. n nmaybe it had something to do with being spring break, but this place was overflowing with kids, and not teenagers, i mean kids 0 10 . who brings kids this young to vegas? i was with another cousin who has a young son, in which they planned ahead and organized a baby sitter. i counted 7 newborns at the pool! are you kidding me?! on the plus side, the water slide was fun. n nthe room was nice, but definitely not a room in which you can have a few people crash. i absolutely hated the fact you cannot lock the entrance to the bathroom. seriously, there are two huge sliding doors that open up to a fancy vanity, a lockable toilet room to the left, and a huge shower to the right, but you cannot lock the sliding doors. this would be a great room for a couple, but unfortunately, we requested two queen beds as we knew there would be more people tagging along, and something got fffed up during the reservation, and we were given one king another reason for the two star review . also, they make you pay for coffee and water in the room. n nthe casino was fun, as i ended up winning, but holy crap, the people were so sketchy. mind you, i love staying downtown, and i know it's a bit seedy, but i was expecting a little bit more from the nugget. i have a feeling that the trash from around town migrate here because it makes them feel less trashy. unfortunately, splashing a fresh coat of paint on a crack house doesn't change the fact that it's a crack house. if this were the el cortez or californian, i wouldn't care, but jazzing something up so much for it to ultimately be a ruse is just pathetic.",1
"Love this studio, people is really friendly and is clean and well kept. Teachers like John, Kimberly and Frank rock! They are not only excellent teachers but they also add an holistic component to it making clases better and nurturing in a physical and spiritual way",2
"Absolutely disgusting! I would not recommend for anyone to go. If you have any expectations at all of eating good tasting food, do not come here. Doesn't matter that it's outdated inside, the food is piping hot because it sits in those metal tins for lord knows how long. I don't even want to know when it was last freshly made. I ate a piece of sushi and there was some foul fish in there that I had to spit it out into a napkin something I've never done before in a ""restaurant "" and lost my appetite for the rest of my meal. Well, I guess my 12 went a long way! Never again.",1
"While in Vegas with family someone suggested we go out for sushi. Now, you have to realize that my experience with sushi has been terrible at best. Tried it at a few local places and didn't care for it but hey, we were in Vegas and we wanted to try some new things. Am I glad we did. I guess one big factor in the sushi experience is a the preparation and b the freshness of the ingredients. Well, they have these two down pat at Shibuya. n nFrom the moment we walked in and sat down we felt relaxed and comfortable. I tried the yellowfin sashimi which was out of this world. Then, I stuck with my tried and true spicy tuna with soy wrap roll which were also just incredible so simple, yet so delicious . Just a dab of soy sauce and I was in heaven. After that, I tried something I never thought I would eat in my life.eel. Ewww.eeeeel. Seriously? Well, great googily moogliy, it was divine. Do yourself a favor, leave your inhibitions at the door and give it a try. Oh man you'll be glad you did. n nCouple that with some sake can't remember what kind it was but it really complimented the meal and the simplicity of the peel your own soy pods and you have just one perfect meal. Definitely try this place out if you are in Vegas. You won't be disappointed.",2
"Great food, great service, a bit more expensive than I expected, but the portion was good. Definitely going back and trying the happy hour as well.",2
"I was excited to try this place because I enjoy going to Town Square. A couple of my favorite stores are there Bebe and MAC to name a few. I was at a Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce Event and decided with my bud Kamila to check it out. I remember Nu Sanctuary and the decor and food which in the beginning were really good. Well, the ambiance when I walked in was OK. I wanted to sit at the bar but we were invited to share a table with friends. The waiter came over and was almost nice. I am a wine drinker. There is one Chardonnay on the menu and maybe four other wines to choose from. It's an Italian eatery so I was very surprised. I lived in Europe almost 15 years and the San Francisco bay area more than 10, I was kind of expecting a honkin wine list. Maybe some Grappa, Armagnac, Cognac, whatever. The price for the wine was reasonable though at 7. Never heard of the vineyard. The waiter could care less. n nTwo of my friends ordered meatballs and Kam and I decided on a Caprese and a Chopped salad but the smaller version both for 5.95 a piece. I literally got two small slivers of mozzarella and two even smaller slices of tomato. No bread. The chopped salad was even skimpier. Not enough to fill your back tooth. Keep in mind I am 5'4 and 110 lbs but I eat like I'm goin to the chair. My meatball dinner bud asked for bread and the waiter told him he didn't order enough food to warrant having bread. Huh? I was MORTIFIED! Who says this? The waiter brings out a large dinner plate with two thin slices of hard bread. I looked at him like he was a car, and it wasn't a Ferrari. n nThere were a lot of guys in the restaurant. Compared to women 15 to 1. I found the staff to be confused and arrogant with the exception of one girl who had no authority but was gracious, the others had frowns and smirks and were ill trained. n nI realize that it may not be a high priced place HOWEVER. If people don't line up to come back you will go out of business faster than you can say wtf Stevie D and Carla Pellegrino why? I adore her and I liked Bacio. I will pay 15 for a glass of wine and a DECENT salad slash meal. Pacify me. n nFix it guys or you will go under faster than you can say where's the bread.",1
My Dad took me here for breakfast today and it was amazing! I had the Huevos Rancheros which was delish! Everyone I was with really enjoyed their food.great portion and prices ,2
We've been this Panda several times. We use the drive thru periodically and every time they claim that one of our items in not ready and we have to go around and wait upfront. n nToday was another time when this happened. We were told our food would be ready in 8 minutes. We waited 15 minutes and then finally went inside . n nWe found the employees freely serving the item we were waiting for . And defending the fact that they basically forgot our order. Terrible service . Drive to a panda somewhere else . Just not this one.,1
"I was genuinely surprised by the quality of this Vegas Strip Spa. You definitely pay the Strip prices here, but its so not worth it here. I had a massage and a facial that were ok, but nothing to write home about. The waiting area was crammed, not enough seats for everybody in there. The tea offered in aforementioned room is very nice, but there was no one around to offer alternatives. I eventually flagged someone down for some cucumber water. nAmbiance was the most disappointing aspect. It was actually loud at some points in the hallway and lounge. Also, the staff, who is obviously used to the tourist crowd, didn't bother asking what my concerns were for my face during my facial or areas of stress or soreness during my massage. Kind of basic regimine, don't you think? nOther reviewers seemed excited by the hammam, which is a nice amenity. Some seemed impressed with the fact you can stay there as long you want is but every other legit spa is like this too. Thanks for blasting the Jersey Shore reruns.it was very soothing. n nSub par, Palms.",1
"this was awful, will not go here again. It was expensive, and, you could not tell nwhat you were getting. The soups were awful, and, the meals were over 15 and up, it was not worth it. The ice cream desserts were melted and more like Ice cream soup, the coffee drinks were over 4.00. Will never go back here again.",1
"After my last conversation with the junior manager at the restaurant, I promised I would write an accurate review here it is. With so many great steakhouses in Vegas, skip this one and go anywhere else. I found my experience there to be a ""used car lot "" of steak houses. They sold items I didnt want hard. For instance I ordered the filet, but the waiter said ""for only 20 dollars more each, you can have the Fiorentina. "" I didnt want it, I had to fight to have what i wanted for dinner, and he wouldnt take no for an answer. That was the story of the entire meal trying to upsell us on every aspect of the meal, including the Chamomile Grappa. I looked around, and this was the story at ever table, with every waiter. Maybe they work on commission? n nTo add insult to injury, due to an error on their part, restaurant agreed to comp 2 drinks as they took over 20 minutes to get our table. In my haste to make a show, I didnt ask for an itemized receipt and trusted the waiter. After the fact, requested the receipt and the drinks had magically reappeared, despite the staff's promises. Like I said a used car lot. 2 stars because the food was very good. The staff and service leaves everything to be desired. There is nothing here that is better than any other steak house, and there is a lot that is worst than most steak houses in terms of service. Meal was 360 for 2 including fraudulently added drinks. junior manager refused to fix after the fact, despite the fact that i paid 360 for a meal . I had eaten at Mastros in Beverly Hills the night before with infinitely better service, lower price, and higher quality food.",1
"This place is awesome. n n n With floor to ceiling shelves chocka full of wines from all over the world, and one of the widest and best selections of Scottish and imported beers that I have ever seen. its your one stop shop for beverages. n n n The staff here are very approachable and really know their stuff they're happy to give you some guidance to help you choose from their impressive selection of wines beers and spirits. n n n Not only do they have a fantastic selection and really friendly service, but its good value too they had a good selection of decent wines at u00a36 or 2 for u00a310, and lots of bottles of vino in the u00a36 u00a312 range, as well as, of course, some delicious bottles at the higher end for those special occasions. n n n If you're looking for an old or new favourite you can't find anywhere else, or searching for a tantalising new tipple to tingle your tastebuds, then this is definitely the place. Get your Thistly Cross Cider here too!",2
"First off.they're getting one star for cheesy bread. That's it. Horrible service tonight for our group. n nWhere do I begin. Took 15 minutes to receive our bottle of wine along with another 10 minute wait for our bottle of water. Meats were tasty for about the 15 minutes when we received them. After that the meats stopped coming around even though our cards were up on green. The meat jockey's were still walking around but seemed to ignore our table. The table next to us also received the ""salad bar "" treatment. n nReally disappointed in the service as I had been waiting for this dining experience for a few weeks now. Decided while waiting twenty minutes for the check that I will probably not return.",1
Absolutely amazing! Their lunch portions are very tasty and perfect portion size. I never leave hungry!,2
"It was my birthday, and we needed some sort of baked good to mark the occasion. Exhausted after a long day of travel, we stumbled upon Petits Gateaux, which was right down the street from where we were staying. It was near closing, but they still had a decent selection. I had to go with Red Velvet, and it was a perfect birthday treat. The shop is adorable it felt so warm and cozy on a chilly fall evening. And the woman behind the counter was nice enough not to laugh when I epically failed at conversing in French. I really wanted to make a return visit, but there are just too many fabulous places in Montreal to get a sugar fix I had to try as many as possible. On our next trip, though, I'm definitely saving room for a cupcake.",2
The closest definition to relaxation I have ever experienced. It is so wonderful and relaxing. The whole staff is professional and kind. My personal happy place in AZ,2
"This is an okay place if you want to grab a quick bite but not anything more than that. I was very disappointed by their holiday turkey sandwich. I was thinking it would be like Capriotti's ""The Bobby "" but that's what I get for thinking! ",1
Thoroughly unimpressed.,1
"This place was horrible. The hotel smelled musky, the carpets in the room felt damp for some reason. The bathtub drain was extremely slow and nasty stuff would come out of the drain when I turned the water on. We called to change our room but they said they were full so they sent a plumber up. After the plumber came and did whatever he had to do and left, I tried the bathtub again. It was STILL clogged.it drained a bit faster but it was stillll clogged. Ugh, didn't bother calling them again cuz I was just gonna be there for one night but I swear I'm never comin back here again. Paid 85 total for this room and I can't even take a decent shower. I read some of the bad reviews on here but decided to take a chance anyway cuz it was cheap and i seriously regret it. DON'T COME HERE!",1
"Well ill start this off on the good points. Its 7 dollars and with the tax and the drink for the buffet. The pizzas are pretty tasty. Love the Cinna bread stuff, the brownies and the apple dessert pizza though it can be a little to sweet. Depends on who makes it. n nNOW FOR THE BAD. nI walk in, and am waiting for a Cashier and it takes 10 minutes before someone comes up to ring me up. The pizza station wasnt stocked at all, and the pizzas that were up there had minimal pizzas left. The bread sticks werent on par with the ones ive had at other Cicis in other states. The Sweet Tea wasnt sweet at all. n nThey have a hard time keeping the pizzas fresh and stocked. Same thing with the Desserts they werent stocked well at all. They come around often and clear your table. They also forget about your special order pizza and instead of taking responsibility they try to pass the blame on someone int he kitchen. n nI have never seen such a worse group of people in there. And ive ate at Cici's in Colorado and Arizona. People coming in wearing Pajama pants and slippers with there underwear plainly visible. Men wearing Shorts with there boxers showing and wearing a wife beater and you can see the disgusting stomach hanging out. Parents letting there kids play with the soda machine, and Kids being inside and are wearing dirty clothes. n nThe restaurant area is clean. But this one straddles the area of Nice and Ghetto on Nellis And Stewart. And I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS ONE. Looking at some of the patrons almost grossed me out so bad i almost lost my dinner. This should be named Pistol Petes and not Cicis Pizza.",1
"Stopped in at the bar with friends for Happy Hour drinks on a Friday night. Not too busy, with very friendly waitstaff bartenders. Had a pear martini excellent. The Hot rock steak appetizer hit the spot, but wished it wouldda been a little bigger. A decent value for HH. I'll try a full meal steak next time.",2
Amazing everyone and everything was just Amazing! ! Lilly was the best server I have ever had very sweet! Thanks so much!,2
"Worst nightclub in Vegas. I'm appalled by their customer service. I've been a regular at Light and I have never been rejected by then because I wear ""flats. "" Excuse me, I have been wearing the exact same pair of shoes to every other club and I was never rejected. The ridiculous part is that I was let in with THE EXACT SAME PAIR OF SHOES but got rejected the second time an hour after . To the ""head of the security department "" of Friday, May 2nd, 2014, you are absurd. You give me no good excuses to give you guys business. You deserved to be fired for denying my rights to get into the club. I hope you get demoted or fired. I have never gave a business a bad review but congratulations, you guys are my first. If I could give you zero stars I would. n n nTerrible. I would rather wait in line in Marquee for 2 hours than spending my money at Light. Get your shit together. thanks.",1
"On my most recent trip to Vegas to celebrate my cousin's 21st birthday my entire party and I had the pleasure of eating here. This upscale sushi restaurant is the latest addition to the Mandalay Bay fine dining scene, which opened July 2013. n nCONCEPT Kumi is a collaboration between the Light Group and executive chef Akira Back Yellowtail Japanese Restaurant Lounge Bellagio . The restaurant's focus is Japanese sushi with a Korean twist, reflecting the chef's Korean background. n nVENUE As stated earlier the restaurant is located on the Mandalay fine dining strip near STRIPSTEAK and Red Square. If you look at the floor you'll see the names of fish written in hiragana. The entrance seems very reminiscent of an entrance to a ryokan and is very inviting. Tables near the entrance allow you to people watch. The lights and back wall created an image of sakura blooming in the springtime. n nSERVICE The server was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. All his menu picks ended up being loved by all. Towards the end it took a little while to flag him down to get the last order of sushi. n nFOOD DRINK With the exception of the Dragon Bowl, for a party of 7 two orders of each of the following menu items were needed as one order wouldn't be enough for each person to try. Usually a serving can feed 2 4 people depending on what else is ordered. This is ultimately the only real con of this place one signature sushi entree isn't going to be enough to feed one person. Those in the listing are there for a reason this is one of the most extravagant places I've eaten in Vegas. n n1. Dragon Bowl their signature bowl drink normally meant for at least 2 people. Each person was able to have several sips. The bowl had one whole lemon garnish and two pineapple leaves as decor. Drink had at the very least pineapple and a good quality rum. n n2. Rock Shrimp Tempura Sriracha Ranch, Micro Celery 16 When I tasted this I was immediately reminded of Spanish patatas bravas as the sriracha ranch tasted EXACTLY like brava sauce and the tempura was crunchy yet light. I could taste the shrimp though the sriracha ranch flavor was strong. This is a very addicting appetizer and I could have easily eaten a bowl to myself. n n3. Hot Mess Crab, Sashimi Poke, Screaming O Sauce 20 The sauce was akin to a spicy teriyaki sauce but I could still taste the crab and the poke. The dish itself was spicy, but the sushi can still linger in the mouth and not burn your tongue. n n4. Pop Rockin' Spicy Tuna, Crab, Salmon, Avocado, Pop Rocks 19 This sushi is an example of an unusual ingredient in a dish the Pop Rocks that works VERY well and makes the dish stand out. The sweet Pop Rocks definitely add to the avocado and the spicy tuna salmon. Flavor combination was just perfect. n n5. Fireball Crab, Cucumber, XXX Hot Kimchee Sauce 19 Least favorite of the sushi but still quite delicious. Crab was soft and the cucumber had a texture very similar to pasta which is why any ""pasta "" dish under 500 calories usually is just cucumber , but like my cousin's friend said, was one dimensional. It was also the spiciest of all the dishes. n n6. Crispy Pork Belly Brussels Coleslaw 17 As everyone was still hungry for at least one more roll my cousin's friend and I wanted to try a non seafood sushi option. The pork belly was crispy and the sweet sauces at the top and bottom balanced the meat. This is another example of a perfect flavor combination and along with the Pop Rockin', my other favorite sushi dish. n nMy cousin had a birthday dessert dish that had mochi ice cream pieces, one for each person. Mochi was soft and fresh and the ice cream was a nice sweet touch to end several sushi courses. n nConsidering I am a person that normally doesn't go out of the way to eat sushi and really doesn't like cheap sushi places, this was certainly one of the best meals I've had this year, one of the best meals I've ever had in Vegas and if I were to rank my top 10 dining experiences, this would certainly be in one of the spots. I look forward to the next opportunity dining here again.",2
"Quick update to the wine tasting. The wine class now costs 20 per person but you receive a voucher for 10 valid that evening only on any bottle of wine. All the featured wines are still 10 off. Seriously, even at 20 it's a great value.",2
"Probably the most unpleasant trip i've ever experienced. Flying with this airline out does sitting in economy by the bathroom on a 15 hour flight. A friend and I were on our way back to JFK from Mexico but had a layover at Charlotte. As we went down to claim our baggage, we realized the conveyer belt wasn't working. A worker comes down and I hear her say that it has been broken for about an hour. So i assumed it was almost fixed. But we stood there for another hour as this tiny old woman was attempting to throw a few bags down from the machine that drops the bags down onto the belt. She eventually gave up. What I didn't understand was why they left the conveyer belt broken for so long, knowing that it was broken and that most of us had a another flight to catch relatively soon. n nWhen we went through customs, another lady indifferently warned us that we'll probably miss our flights. So yes, we missed our flights and when we finally claimed our bags, more US airways workers gave us no direction on where to go and just took our bags from us and threw them onto another conveyer belt with no explanation. It was just insanely hectic. The only flight after that 1 pm flight was the 10 pm flight which left us stuck in a city where even the airport workers told us wasn't worth the money to visit. We were completely exhausted, but the added indifference of the airline as well as the incredibly rude and snotty workers did nothing but make me realize that I will never fly with US Airways again.",1
"The hotel has great appeal. Love the wooded forest area with water works. They also have a handful of restaurants inside as well. Nothing too fancy here, and that's ok. The only complaint I have is the low shower heads and odd water sprayer. The water temp is also touchy when trying to control it. If I had to stay off the strip again I would be comfortable doing so here. Also the buffet is not the greatest but you get what you pay for.",2
"She said. "" Eh i dont know if this is the right nathans or not, but it was in the palms food court. Not good at all, and way too expensive for the amount of food you get. So does this make sense.we got 3 hot dogs, one hot dog as a combo but they were all the same price. pretty lame, go somewhere else if u wanna pay 30 bucks for lunch for 2. "" n nHe said, ""So here we go with ""world famous "" again.maybe world famous rip off? so you can order a 5.95 chilli cheese dog or a 5.95 chilli cheese dog combo.apparently its the same price. We tried to tell the manager and she was confused. Maybe the smell of hot dogs got to her.or she just didn't care. Very overpriced for a bunch of meat mashed into long cylinder. What a joke this place was. """,1
"This place was way too small to even be a nightclub and the vibe was not right! There was a mixture of all kinds of people and people of even different ages were in this club and most of my friends were not feeling like this was a good club at all. The music was wack, the drinks were wack, and the gogo dancers were not dancing sexy at all. Arent gogo dancers supposed to be super hot and sexy?",1
Had dinner here last Saturday night. We were seated right away. Food was decent. service sucked. Couldn't get refils on our drinks. Mixed drinks also suck btw. I'd like a little alcohol in them if I'm paying 6 a drink. Our waiter was never around so we kept asking other servers to help us. Instead of waiting on tables they seemed to all gather at the end of the bar for story time. Some sort of uniform should be required. If you are marketing yourself as a upscale Sushi restaurant your servers shouldn't be wearing ripped t shirts and polo's with the number 87 on the back. I won't be back. I can drive 2mins down the road to Kona Grill and get great sushi and great service.,1
"A cool place for hot coffee just off Main in down town Mesa. Great service by knowledgable employees serving great coffee and expresso. I like the warm feel of wood floors and tables. The pastry case contained a nice selection, including a very tasty quiche. The coffee is roasted locally by Lost Dutchman Coffee, so you can sample new coffees and buy a pound in a very well constructed stay fresh bag. The music is not obtrusive and they have a pool table, suggesting people should socialize rather than bury themselves in electronic devices, but there is WiFi.",2
"I honestly feel like my wait time for this place is a sick joke. Ordered a green smoothie it took me 45 minutes to receive it. I understand and appreciate that you make everything fresh, however, you should warn your customers BEFORE purchase if it's going to take that long. Please be respectful of your customers time or hire more staff. I will definitely not be back.",1
"Went here for Breakfast with my Grand daughter. She loved the play place. I ordered the bacon egg biscuit, hash browns and iced coffee for me and since they do not have happy meals at breakfast time they really need to come up with a happy meal breakfast! we ordered scrambled eggs and bacon for her. My biscuit was very dry and the hash browns were cold in the middle. Scrambled eggs were not fully cooked but bacon was nice and crispy.",1
"Service south of the border. nWe have been strong supporters for Cantina Laredo, referring all our friends to try it out. Service has always been very good. Until tonight. We arrived, sat at the Bar and asked what the Happy Hour specials were. After being told that the Merlot and Cab were 4.00 I ordered the Merlot. We relocated to a table across from the Bar so another couple who we invited could join us. We asked the server before ordering anything if she would split the check because we were ordering dinner and our friends were just having Apps and drinks. We were told no problem. So far so good. We then got a different server who had a attitude and was not a people person. Drinks took excessively a long time to get. I ordered Fortaleza Blanco tequila, Neat. The server forgot what i asked for so i repeated what i wanted and he repeated what i requested, then he was going to give me the wrong tequila that I ordered even after repeating my request for what I asked for. nThe check came and we were charged 9.50 for glasses of wine instead of the 4.00 happy hour charge, When the bill came, it was bundled together instead of split and the server got a new attitude when I told him I had asked the 1st server to split the check. Our friends were very upset and vowed to never return. Not a happy camper. Vegas has 1000's of places to dine and if customers are treated properly resturants go as fast as they come. I hope Cantina Laredo improves.",1
"I loathe Wells Fargo. n nLong lines, huge hassles, and employees not fit to be working at a fast food joint. I had a nice employee once. Literally, once. Every other time, my transactions are brutally trying. n nI closed my personal account years ago after getting the run around at their downtown Glendale location. n nWhen I opened an account for my class at this particular location only because I had to , the business accounts employee looked mortified when I handed her a couple hundred dollars in cash to deposit. And she almost wouldn't take the change because it wasn't in rolls until I explained the idiocy of asking me to do this when there wasn't enough of each coin to make a complete roll. Then, she kept miscounting the amount and telling me my deposit number was wrong because she couldn't understand the concept of a 2 bill. Thankfully, she's not there anymore because she got promoted. Yup, promoted. n nI had to call the 800 number to try to get an untrustworthy person's credit cards canceled on one of our accounts. Guess what they told me? That they couldn't cancel him unless they had the number on the card, but we didn't have the cards with the numbers on them in our possession, thus the reason behind wanting them canceled. After I pointed out the ridiculousness of this policy all I got was ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. "" n nGrrrr! I could go on and on because every transaction at Wells Fargo has been somewhere between aggravating and enraging.",1
"I would not pay to even board a flea here. I took my precious baby, Chloe here while I went on a business trip. n nWhen I returned, Chloe was skin and bones. She definitely was not fed properly or even got any kind of attention as her kennel was disturbingly dirty. It was disgusting. Also, I had a friend visit while I was gone and he witnessed employees kicking kennels where the dogs were barking. n nOh yeah, guess what the icing on the cake is? Yup, Chloe is sick. Has some thick drool from her mouth and discharge from his eyes and nose.",1
"I am going to comment about their Catering Services but this applies to their food quality as well. n nWe ordered 200 of catering food to feed a household after a recent death. The service there was first awful. The order was called in advance and told us a time to pick it up. I went there and half the dishes were still not ready. I had to wait another 45 minutes just to pick it up. n nYou would think they would assist you when picking up 12 trays of food, nope, no assistance there, carried it all myself. n nWe ordered breaded chicken filets, mashed potatoes, house salad, and everything was awful. Worse yet they forgot a whole tray of chicken and we had to call them and tell them about it because they were completely unaware this was part of my order, but don't worry they made sure to get my money for it, if you get my drift. I'm not saying it was on purpose, but when I called do you think they gave me anything off for having to come back to the store? Nope, not even a penny. Did I get a good apology and an offer to come to our house and drop it off? Nope on both accounts. Just a bit of lip served apology and here's your chicken. n nTo sum up my experience is the service is terrible, and the food is horrible. If you call this high school cafeteria food Italian I've got the Brooklyn Bridge to sell you.",1
"went Fri.nite at about 10 30 guy at the window sounded like lurch thru the intercom, very extremely dis interested, being a medical worker, once I got up to the window noticed he was either high as a kite on downers, or coming down with a bad case of the flu,hoing for the latter, got home 5 mins. later had to sling eveything in the garbage, fries were stale, whopper was gross, fish sandwich was hard as a rock, I think they micro waved everything I ordered. never again, I am contacting the company",1
"I recently brushed a road cone and damaged the paint job my Honda Accord near the right head light which was also damaged . I took the car to Body Works Plus for an estimate. Some of streaks looked bad enough to warrant a repaint of the area and a new headlight, n nRather than push an expensive repaint, I was advised to go with the less expensive option buffing . I was very happy with the advice and the result. The car ended up looking good as new and no need for a new headlight . They even washed the car down. n nThe employees took the time to answer my many and repeated questions and I was given rides to and from the local bakery Amelie's Bakery for the duration of the repairs. Rental cars and free loaners when available are also an option. n nMy experience was positive and I will go again should I have more car issues.",2
"Dollar Tree can't be relied upon. n nThis is the third of their stores I visited. I needed a dozen balloons for a party and tried to purchase them about a week in advance. The first store had balloons, but no helium. The second store had helium, but no balloons. I was told the balloons and helium MUST be purchased at the same store. When I arrived at this location, I purchased a dozen balloons and was PROMISED by the Assistant Manager that he would make sure there was enough helium on hand to fill them the day of the party. He even took my name phone number and wrote them down on a duplicate copy of my receipt as a reminder to himself. n nFast forward to the day of the party. I arrive and they have no helium and the Assistant Manager and copy of the receipt were nowhere to be found. INFURIATING! I had a party to get to and no helium for the balloons! n nLuckily, I was able to get helium at another location, after all. But what if none were available there, either? This is just proof that Customer Service, even at the management level, lacks at Dollar Tree.",1
I just don't understand charging 8 or 9 dollars for a breakfast combo. At least it's quick and consistent.,1
"Placed an online to go order. Ordered a half sandwich and a house salad and a grilled BBQ pasta with a house salad. The total was 24. Yes, 24 for two lunch specials. Specials are typically discounted hence the ""special "" label. They obviously don't get that part or that's why they don't advertise the prices online. Went to pick up my order and found all of the to go order parking spots taken with no one in their cars and no one inside waiting for their orders. The food was good but not great. I suggest skipping their online ordering set up all together. It's not worth it",1
"The only problem I've had is that the spray tan machine has been down every now and again, which I get but super annoying still. Friendly staff. Great spray tan use the barrier cream on your hands and feet . They do charge you for all the little add ons so even if you buy the groupon, you're still spending 18 for a spray but that's still a good deal! I like this place if you're in need of a quick spray tan ",2
"Bean is such a necessary addition to Charlotte's predominantly sub standard restaurant landscape. Their menu is a triumph of mouth watering fare. Bean boasts a cozy L shaped dining room with a classic bar that is staffed with good, friendly people. Nicholas was our server for the evening. He was very friendly, casually dressed, and obviously loves repping a seriously great restaurant. I had the bacon cheeseburger with mac cheese and sweetened iced tea. My first bite into that veggie burger informed me of the genius that went on in the kitchen as my eyes bugged out. Dessert was this ridiculously rich chocolate cake. The tea wasn't as sweet as I prefer, but that is such a minor complaint when everything else hit the mark.",2
"I had always resisted going to Rosati's because they don't usually have any seating available, so imagine my surprise and delight when I found out that this Rosati's on Mineral Point did indeed have seating and full wait service! n nWith the first ""blizzard "" of 2009 breathing down our neck, we ventured over to Rosati's to try their pizza. Folks at work raved about it, so we set our expectations high. We arrived and were pleased to discover they were open and that they did indeed have plenty of seating 6 large booths, a few tables, and a bar to sit at . n nThe waitress invited us in and told us to sit wherever we'd like. As we were sitting down, she brought us complimentary popcorn, along with the menus. Tonight's special was fried chicken, but we opted for the double dough meat lover's pizza. We added a Miller Lite and a couple of sodas for good measure. n nPizza arrived it was h u g e. Their ""large "" is closer to an extra large if you'd ask me. We took our first bite, and yum. The cheese was fantastic very flavorful, great texture, and perfectly proportioned. The toppings were tasty as well fresh and flavorful. The sauce had just a hint of a kick, which was a pleasant surprise. n nI'm not sure that I'd order the double dough crust again they have thin, double dough, Chicago style, and stuffed I'd probably try the thin, as the double was just a tad too bready for my liking, but that's really nit picking on my part. n nThe service was absolutely awesome our waitress checked in several times, made sure our drinks were always full, and followed up at the perfect intervals. Top notch, for sure! We will definitely be back. n nRosati's WIN n nService 5 stars fantastic! friendly and helpful nFood 4 stars very solid pizza nValue 4 stars 26 for large pizza drinks nMIsc 4 stars great menu variety, nice seating area n nSummary It's not often that you get great service from a pizza place, let alone a place that specializes primarily in delivery and carry out. Combine Rosati's awesome service, huge menu, their delicious pizza, and the great overall value and you can't go wrong.",2
"First time here and very impressed! My wife and I brought my parents here and we loved it! The bruschetta board is the way to go with big servings of each. We had the red peppers and goat cheese, apple brie and dates, classic bruschetta, and the smoked salmon. All were delicious! The atmosphere is pretty trendy, and you have to valet your car cause there is no parking around the area. To be honest its a little hard to have conversations in there as the music was pretty loud. I could see how they would have that cause it seemed geared more to a younger crowd. That was the only drawback. I also had one of their Panini's, the Nine Iron. It was good but could of done with out so much lettuce and had more meat. Overall a great experience and coming back again to enjoy the bruschetta board.",2
"After trying Black Dog Smoke Ale House last week, I was eager to try a new BBQ joint. In order to make a fair comparison, I ordered the same thing a pulled pork sandwich. The sauce itself was ok a little sweet, but unfortunately I couldn't taste the pork. My sandwich consisted of bun BBQ sauce with almost NO meat. The sauce was so overwhelming, and the lack of protein so significant that you almost couldn't tell if you were eating pulled pork or brisket. It tasted exactly like my mother in law's shredded BBQ beef made in the crock pot.Which is fine, for a crock pot dinner, but if your whole restaurant is BBQ you should make something better than anyone could make by sticking a pork butt in the crock pot, covering w BBQ sauce and walking away for 8 hours. The mac and cheese was also meh it tasted like Stouffer's frozen with salt and paprika sprinkled on top. n nIf you want great BBQ, skip Blues and Hickory River, head to Black Dog in Urbana!",1
"My company threw us a party at the VIP lanes. I must say, I was impressed! The food was crap. BBQ pork sliders, chicken parm sliders, and burger sliders. Not that great. Veggie platter that had red green n yellow bell peppers, squash and olives. It was ok. They also had chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla ice cream sandwiches. Those were delicious! n nWe had open bar. The bar was filled with premium alcohol. I had belvedere all night along with bottles of Fiji water. Beer selection wasn't as impressive as the liquor. Beers were bud, bud light, copes light, and ultra. But it was all free for us so it's all good. n nNow the best part. The VIP lanes are in the back, in it's own area. We had 8 private lanes. There were comfortable lounge seating areas that fit at least 10. The seats at the bowling area were comfy as well. They played music videos from several eras on several large screens. The animations on the overhead monitors for each frame were fun. Wasn't the same boring animation for a strike. The atmosphere was very fun and upbeat. Selection of music was to all our liking. The space was spacious and felt cozy at the same time. We had at least 50 people there and it didn't feel cramped at all. Definitely a great venue for a private party. I'm a huge fan. If the food was good I'd give it 5 stars.",2
"Only went cause friends invited. Next time I will politly tell friends they are on there own. Seriously, Realy how hard is it to cook a steak MEDIUM WELL, for them impossible. Steak came out RARE they took back and cooked more, still not done. Thanks for reinforcing your nickname CRAPPLEBEES! You guys are not worth my money anymore, what a JOKE. Good For NOTHING",1
"My gf wanted to see this so I booked it online will call , easy enough. We got the later show because it had better seat options. We got the lower level and aisle seats. Perfect, at one point the performers were right next to here dancing! n nThey do sell overpriced snacks popcorn, candies and sodas and drinks. n nMy gf loved the show I thought it was pretty good. If you try to follow the story you'll get lost so just enjoy the music and performance. The only other Cirque du Soleil show we've been to was ""O "", and compared to that this show's acrobatics isn't as impressive. But it still is very entertaining.",2
"Update to previous review I kept having leakage issues with my valve cover gasket even after Eurowise re did this repair. The shop I took it to in my new city very reputable, highly reviewed by many, and winner of several local awards took the old gasket off and studied everything very carefully, knowing ahead of time my history with this repair. They expected the valve cover to be warped . Turns out the cover was totally fine but that Eurowise had used an extremely cheap after market gasket, and then not come CLOSE to securing all the bolts to factory requirements. This caused the continuing issues here, and led to my having to re do this 600.00 repair again out of pocket. Now previously Eurowise did my water pump and did a fine job no issues. So I would not advise not going there, but be careful.",1
"My husband and I recently signed up and I really like this location. There are tons of classes that are included in the membership. I've tried yoga, pilates, Zumba and aqua fit so far and have really enjoyed all of them. It helps prevent me from getting bored with the gym. I would recommend this location, but check to see if your employer has a pre negotiated rate with them. I was able to sign up online and didn't have to deal with sales. We walked in, got our key tags and were on our way. YAY!",2
"Employees are friendly. Coffee is decent. Prices are good. BUT THE WIFI IS AWFUL, and that's the main reason I leave my house for coffee. I really wish their connectivity was better because I would make the extended drive past three Starbucks and one other coffee house to go to It's A Grind, but not until they fix their WiFi.",1
"Had a backed up drain last night from cooking . Got on Craigslist at 9am, found Darrel, and he was at my house by 11am. Super friendly, fast service, and 45 flat fee drain cleaning. Good and honest service!",2
" ""Woohoo, as good as it gets! "" is on the money for me when it comes to Crepe Cellar. I love this place and I seriously daydream about it often and get excited whenever its in the mix as a dinner option. To start, its got a great personality its dimly lit, the decor is intimate and personable as the place itself is more on the smaller side. Because it is on the smaller side, sometimes there is a wait. However, it is nice that they take your number to text you so you can pop on over to a nearby bar to grab a drink and be alerted when you're about to be in for a treat! n nOkay, let me state the obvious Pesto Brie Fries. Do not ever not order these. They should always be ordered, no matter how many times you have had them. I love fries, I love cheese, and I love pesto and the mix of all three, my goodness, phenomenal. They have never had an 'off day' or come out soggy or lacking in toppings, they are just always fantastic and worth eating your weight in fries. n nThe rest of the menu is just as fantastic. We have tried quite a few things off the menu and I have thoroughly enjoyed them all. Its one of those places where I could order my favorite thing over and over but I legitimately want to try everything. Their dinner crepes are well sized and stuffed and are very good, as are their pizzas. n nThey have changing specials and these are aaaalways SO delicious. I have tried their swordfish and a PBR bacon mussels option and I enjoyed them so much, I went home to try and find pathetically recreate the recipes. I have yet to succeed in this endeavor . I am anxiously looking forward to the short rib option, as last time they were out so I will clearly need to return soon for this. As for dessert, somehow, I have yet to have a dessert crepe here I dont know how as I love crepes and I love dessert, so something is wrong here and I'll fix this soon. n nPoint is, this place is truly 'as good as it gets.' Their waitstaff is attentive, polite, timely, and truly interested in their customers and that is a huge plus. The food is so delicious and I want to try everything and so should you. Now, go. Don't forget to order the fries. drools a little ",2
"I'm skewing the perfect record but I'm sorry. I haven't been this disappointed in a dining experience in a very long time. My family and I sat for almost 10 minutes while we waited for our meal. The waiter finally stopped by, asked if we had ordered any drinks, but realized we didn't have menus, and left without taking any drink orders. 10 minutes later he's back with menus. Still no drink orders. 15 or so minutes later he finally takes our drink order. So needless to say, the service was poor. When we finally did order, we were famished. n n My husband had their signature burger which he described as forgettable. nMy father had a grilled cheese with mushrooms, and Chicken Chili. He loved the chili describing it as ""filling and hearty "" n My mother had the fish fry and she loved it. nI had the chicken and dumplings and I was quite disappointed. It lacked depth, and flavor. My husband took a bite and said the Military MREs has more flavor. n nThe service was poor, the table of drunk girls got unwavering attention. So perhaps, they cater to a drinking crowd. n nBest part of the evening? Watching a Scottsdale mom pull an Olive out of her martini and feed it to her infant. DRUNK BABY ALERT lol n nMy take away, come for the booze. Ignore the ""gourmet "" menu.",1
"One of my Madison favorites. Always something new to try. Good staff, offbeat atmosphere, great service and food. However I will note that not everyone I bring here has enjoyed their food. I think I talked it up too much.",2
"I love this place! It helped that we had arguably the best table for a view of the Bellagio fountains as well as a supposedly French waiter. The setting is absolutely perfect for both people watching and a great view of the city. We had the bacon and frisee salad upon our waiter's recommendation, and it was delicious. We also had shrimp cocktail and steak frites with merlot butter sauce as well as peppercorn sauce on the side. We decided we liked the peppercorn slightly better, but both were delicious. Our waiter was also a real character and kept us entertained, even bringing us a free dessert at the end.",2
"This is the worst meal quality I have had in a long, long time. Undercooked green beans, scalloped potatoes, and beef enchiladas. The single high point was the free draft wine coupon per paid customer.",1
"Tonight was actually our second night at the Brat Haus the first time we went for a few beers, a game of washers, and to try the bavarian pretzels they were absolutely delicious that night so we decided to go back.and soon. n nWe had a very different experience tonight. After being seated we waited for 10 15 minutes before a server greeted us he said that he would figure out who our server was but took our beer order. When our server arrived she didn't apologize, nor did she introduce herself, she dropped off our beers, quickly took our order and was off. It was another 45 50 minutes before our food arrived. My husband ordered a beer brat, something he grew up with in Wisconsin and has made himself time to time. He said that it was peppery and had no beer flavor and he didn't enjoy it at all. He made better beer brats himself last weekend and the man is no chef! I had ordered the vegan grain sausage and what I was presented with was a soft veggie burger. I was a little confused but ate it anyway, it was rather bland and the ""burger "" part of it not at all crisp. I was really excited for my ""fake brat "" so that was a disappointment and, frankly, should be listed under the burger section if that is the ""sausage "". We ordered the fries as well which were ok we would have loved to get them a little earlier if we'd known it was going to take so long to prepare our meals. n nAfter dinner we had another round of beers and ordered another pretzel this time, the pretzel we received was rock hard and not at all enjoyable to eat. We had asked for honey mustard and curry ketchup and received honey on the plate. After 2 hours we had finally paid our bill and walked quickly away from a bad dining experience. n nThe only positive thing I can say about this place at this point is that the beer is decent, but it's not the only place in Phoenix with decent beer. n nI'm not sure what was going on with this place tonight, but I hope they figure things out. This is exactly the kind of concept of a place we would go to regularly but after tonight my husband said he won't go back.",1
"A real 4.5 star rating for lil' Baguette Cafe. If you're in the area or work nearby , there's no better place to pick up a fresh 'wich, salad, or juice. The menu is small, so they don't spread themselves to thin here. That being said, theres something for everyone. Eggs all day, salads with various greens and meats , pastries and hot cold sandwiches are all represented. I've yet to hit the pressed sammies, but The Turkey, crispy greens and egg baguette panini w ham added are enough to have me hooked. Everything tasted fresh and the portion sizes were perfect for lunch. n nThe real knocks here are the location NOT easy to find from the road. Use the map in the Yelp app and that the place is a bit small. When the queue reaches 4 people, you might be waiting outside or right on someone who is eating. Avoid the lunch rush and you're money!",2
"Nice job Cedars! They replaced the styrofoam plates with ceramic, and must have changed their recipes on a few items. Everything was tastier than I remember. I am moving it up to 5 stars because the owner remembers what I order and how I like my food. I true family restaurant.",2
"I am not pleased. My friend bought me a cheeseburger from this location, and something was definitely wrong with it. Strange texture, I think it may have been really old or something. I didn't eat a lot of it, but that night, I felt dizzy and my stomach had sharp pains. I still feel pains in both my sides from that damn cheeseburger. NOT going to this location or any Circle K if I can help it again! Stomach infection not worth it.",1
LOVE LOVE this buffet. I have been going here for years and it just gets better. The quality of the food is amazing and surpringly I come here for other food besides the crab legs i'm not much in that stuff . Every bite you can tell this food was preciously made not mass produced like other buffets. Why I love this place is different than others but I love their pasta and how you can choose the amount of sauce you want. n nThe service was good and attentive. The line wasn't long but we did go on a Wednesday night. I like the hush puppies and pretty much the whole seafood aisle. n nMake sure to order coffee. It's delish and I like it than the other buffets I went to. If you want a soda. order both. that's tbe beauty of buffets. all you can drink too.,2
"Located on Fremont Street, and not far from Golden Nugget. This place probably seen better days. n nThe only reason why I go here, is for the cheap Deep Fried Twinkies in Las Vegas. Can't beat the 99 cents deep fried Twinkies. Even though, I know its not really good for me, but got to love the deep fried Twinkies. But, they could probably clean up the deep fry station and better customer service. Really didn't need some one telling me ""Don't forget my tip. "" With that remark, why would I tip you for being some what rude. But I guess 10 of a dollar, is probably all she'll get from me. n nBut the place itself, can probably look better, with out the slot machines that doesn't seem to work, time and time again. If the place was just a place to have a deep fried Twinkies and a slushy bar. Then it would be nice. But with the old school slot machines, and not so happy staff. I believe that this could of been a better place with a better review. n nIf you're into gambling or putting a quarter in a slot machine, this is not the place to do so, cause you'll probably not get any service or any help, probably in 30 60 minutes later. The slushy drinks and the deep fry station in the back, is probably a good place to get them.",1
"Had not been to the Chart House in years, food and service was 5 stars ! Went with a group of friends form our local leads group , in Chatsworth Ca, we started with apps. Shrimp kabobs, Mac Cheese, salad yummy ! Main course for me was Seared Ahi on mashed! Everything was done to the 10ens . n nI would go back, and I would tell a friend !",2
"People who said this is one of the best steak house they ever had. Obviously doesn't know better, coming from a gal who eats everywhere in vegas this place is mediocre. Oh and the girls dancing or dusting in middle of the dinnig area!? dunno if that helps either it's not tacky but it's just silly. I want good steak and fat foie gras Michael Mina and Gordon Ramsey steak",1
Great food. A tad pricey for BBQ and drinks though. 20 for 10oz beef brisket?! But you could cut it with your fork. I will be back.,2
"Linen's Plus, the store that was perfect for me closed. The staff here has gone out it's way to accommodate me and I appreciate it. It's a smaller store and they have been out of things I am looking for. They have always offered to have things sent in for me or at least find it in another store so I can pick it up that day if I need it. n n Since I lost the store where I shopped enough that the magnetic strip was worn off my credit card, I have discovered Bed, Bath, and Beyond, does carry a wider range of products than I would have known otherwise. The staff is for the most part, very knowledgeable about their stock. n nA special compliment to this store. Occasionally I shop for a friend using her Amex card. This store always checks ID's and if your picture isn't on the card, they won't ring you up! How often does anyone even check let alone stick to the store policy.",2
"We've been to HB BBQ a couple times thanks to Groupon, and I'm a big fan of the ribs. The meat literally falls off the bone, and the sauce is excellent. The second time we went we had the chicken and rib plate, which is how we'll probably do it from now on. n nI'm not a fan of the sides, otherwise this place would have had 5 stars. There's not a lot of seating, so going during major meal times can present a problem if you're planning to dine in. Also, It doesn't look like they can seat large parties together.most of the tables only seat 4 people. n nOverall, the meats are excellent. It is definitely a place I have and would continue to go back to. I'd go more often, but they're not that close to where I live.",2
"This is my favorite place to eat in the MGM as its cheap, tasty and always fast. The nasi goreng is amazing as it comes complete with chicken satay skewers and a cooling cucumber dip which you need as the rice is very spicy. nThe BBQ combination is also brill and the sushi is so fresh and tasty. Been here about six times and have never had bad service or a bad meal, maybe I'm easy to please but trust me go and give it ago.x",2
"I'm sitting in the car, about to leave the parking lot and suddenly it hits me. n nIt had been quite awhile since I had been to Jalape u00f1o Inferno and was ready to venture a little from home to get some spicy pseudo Mexican American food, because I remembered it being so satisfying. nApparently it has been for good reason I haven't made this trek in awhile. In short, I haven't missed anything. n nWe started off with the guacamole. n nDid you expect an awesome description? nI expected guacamole. What I did get was a few avocados shoved into a blender with a tomato and slopped onto a plate. Really, Jalape u00f1o? You sprinkle some cheese on it and bring it out to me with a chip in the middle? Apparently whoever was in the kitchen even gave up when they were attempting to taste it. n nMy girlfriend ordered the Texas Style Stacked Enchiladas and I, being the spicy food connoisseur I am, went with my past favorite Courtney's Special. The enchiladas? She hated them. Her family creates genuine authentic Mexican food on a daily basis, of course she had no problem dismantling the disaster that lay before her. ""It looks like a confused stack of tostadas, "" I agreed. They were good for what they were, and sometimes it pays to think outside the box and I can appreciate that. In this case though, maybe start with an actual enchilada and work your way up from there. It can't be that hard and I'm sure if you asked, someone would gladly show you how to accomplish it. Next, the Courtney's Special, grilled chicken which was very juicy, kudos and black beans with a big helping of cilantro. It wasn't anything like what I remembered it being. To make it worse, it wasn't even that spicy. That sucks too, considering the only reason I come here is for that particular burrito. Oh well. n nIt seems to me that the owners are a little preoccupied with their newest establishment, hell, they even gave me a 5 gift card to their Rhythm Wine Bistro when they carried my half ton check over and nonchalantly lowered it down onto the table. Minor exaggeration. n nThe bill 42 for the burrito, the enchiladas, avocado pur u00e9e, a water and a tea. n nHere's my tip take it from the guys that know it best. This close to Mexico, and with as many authentic Mexican food places we have here in Phoenix, it shouldn't be that hard to do some homework and take a couple cues from the creators. Keep it simple, keep it cheap, keep it awesome. n nTwo stars for my waitress who, despite never refilling my tea in the hour and half we sat in the establishment, kept a bubbly attitude. That I appreciate.",1
"Disappointed. The Prime Rib was over cooked. I was expecting more for 29.99 per person. Good selection but just not all that good. Asian food so so. Pizza tasted like frozen. It feminded me of Vegas 15 years ago when 4.99 T Bones were the rage, except with new Vegas prices.",1
"I'm really surprised I forgot to review this place when I ate here some months ago. nI doubt anything has changed. nWOOD COAL flame grilled burgers made to order right in front of you, condiment bar, and beer available. It is unknown whether beer choices have improved over the standard yellow piss. Someone message me. n nRustic and dingy atmosphere, and spartan seating. nPlease DO NOT be turned off by this. nYou're here for an AUTHENTIC flame grilled burger. nYou top your burger how you want! nOrder it medium. nAbsolutely scrumptious burger. nJuicy. nSmokey. nTOTALLY REAL. nYou can't get any more real. n nTHAT IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW. nExcept CASH ONLY.",2
"Employees are rude, expect you to know their secret bagel language when ordering.

"I had them deliver four pizzas for an event with a client in their area. Delivery was fine and the price was within reason, but I've never had a more bland pizza in my life. The sauce had zero flavor. Horrible!",1
"I found this place to be pretty enjoyable. I had the smoked chicken over the southwest salad. Also had the wings with bbq sauce and the fried pickles. Don't think I'd order those again, but the salad was definitely great. It was a nice way to enjoy the bbq withough getting all weighed down with the heavy stuff.",2
"The hotel needs some updating to be a 5 star resort. However, the service was great. Willow Stream Spa was the best. You can practically spend your day at the spa with the Swiss showers, sauna, steam room, relaxation room, aerobics classes, and so much more. They also provide healthy and reasonably priced meals. It was so relaxing.",2
"Nice place, nice people, great music. Everything was wonderful my husband and I came here for my birthday and had a blast! can't wait to go again. We danced the night off it was amazing. The staff had curtsey skills which makes it a plus.",2
"Good cheese? Yes. n nVarious paraphernalia? Yes. n nGood attitude? No. n nWe stopped here yesterday, and were surprised by the cold attitude of the staff. We bought some of the cheese, but they made no effort to offer samples. There were some samples that had been pre cut and left out, probably for hours, though. n nWe came back today with a Grupon, and the staff member was quite put out that we hadn't called in advance to get a reservation. Nowhere on the Grupon did it suggest that it was needed. We were served, but with rudeness and coldness. n nIn addition, I bought a sandwich from them. Due to the fact that there was an Art Walk going on and there were many people coming into the shop, they had pre made many sandwiches. The roast beef sandwich I bought was unpleasant. n nFor cheese, yes. Otherwise, eh.",1
"11 13 10 n nDon't ever come here! n nShould've known better than to stay and try the food, after having to wait several minutes before being greeted by our server the restaurant was empty except for seated employees about to have a meal It took more than ten minutes before we were given glasses of water. Service was very slow the noodles arrived first, and that was half an hour or more after we arrived our server was surly, almost to the point of rudeness and my nephew and I even checked out the aquarium there it was almost void of live fish maybe one swimming , w dead fish and excrement floating in the cloudy water. NASTY! But and there's always a ""but "" in these kinds of reviews, isn't there? we were starving. Next time, I will insist on going somewhere else, especially when there are many signs telling us to! Funnily enough, the restroom here wasn't that bad. I'm thinking maybe not many people came to eat here, so the restrooms aren't used much? LOL n nTotal bill was just under 50, w minimal tip. Food included about six dim sum plates, a beef stir fry, lo mein noodles, tea, and water. The only item all of us liked here Mom, sister, my nephew, and me were the noodles! The beef stir fry was the only thing I thought was palatable, w some of the meat tougher than the others. Don't even get me started on the dim sum fillings! I'd never recommend this place for dim sum to anyone! n nI wouldn't be surprised to hear this place closing down very soon, if it isn't already. What a horrible experience. ",1
"We went to Roy's for a midweek dinner it was so crowded we ended up sitting at the bar. No problem, they serve the full menu. n nUntil the end of September they have a combo plate available that features both the butterfish beef short ribs for 30. It's the perfect amount of food a great choice to be able to try an option from both land sea. I got to try a bite of the mahi mahi which I will definitely order next time. n nVery good service a beautiful restaurant!",2
I have been to this place recently. I was highly disappointed. The food took 30 minutes to get. When we finally got our food it was cold. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Chandler area.,1

I asked her the information about the seats, and she told me she is new, so she doesn't know. Not Helpful staff at all. nThe server was slow that we had to ask for refills every time for the coffee and beverage. The tuna burger was dry and very fishy. nMost people come here to enjoy the strip view and Bellagio water show.

This pizza actually tasted better the next day, cold. n nNot much of a secret anymore. It's on the third floor.

"Alright, I have been visiting Dr. Coury's office for years now. I have to say is that I am a medical snob. I'm originally from Boston which is hospital capital of the world. Only the best of the best work in Boston. With that being said I am always skeptical about any other Dr. who have ever treated me outside of Boston, but I will say this, the Physicians Assistants and Dr. Coury himself, I am actually very impressed with. They are knowledagble and very courteous to me the patient.

How often can you go somewhere and get a dish made with quinoa, being that I am recovering vegetarian, I was super excited! Then he brought out this ""pasta "" dish and as the name states it was D'lish! The great thing about D'lish is that each dish is freshly made with locally grown produce. I've been there several times and everything I've had has been refreshingly healthy, balanced, and tastes great. n nThe owner keeps telling me that I need to come in and try breakfast but since I live in Gilbert I have yet been able to make it over.

"This establishment looks cool kind of a western themed Hooters, but with a much larger menu. And, I've actually had a pretty good burger served here. However, the place has such problems with service. These problems are so aggravating that I wouldn't even waste time going to this restaurant. It might be OK for a beer on the patio during Happy Hour, but steer clear of expectations of having no problems with your bill, or the food served properly, etc. I went in with a coupon that was clearly valid and that I had paid for. They refused to accept it because it was electronic my phone, the coupon company says that you don't need to print them out and not on paper . . .

"In a nutshell, the biggest dining disappointment of our trip. I'll make this brief The service was horrible, the selections from the menu were appallingly small, and the silverware was filthy. n nIn the Paris Hotel of all places! I asked for Beschemel and the server looked at me quizzically and stated, ""Uh, I don't think so, but we have Cholula and Tapatio if you want. "" Why the f k would I want hot sauce in stead of Beschemel? That's like asking for gravy and being offered hot wing sauce. WTF? n nI ordered up an omelette that had to be sent back twice because it looked like it was made of burlap. The manager said they had a new cook, but you'd think a cook in Vegas could handle an omelette. n nThey had no French Vanilla creamer for coffee mind you, this is in the Paris. n nThey're lucky I can't give them no stars.",1

"the beerfest gets crowder and stupider the closer it gets to the weekend. n ni volunteer some of my time working this year at the yelp booth spreading the words to non believers about the virtue of using the website and the app itself. the shit is free to use, what's not to love? at the same time, i got to walk around and sample some beers coupons are 1 each and beers are between 2 to 6 with the most expensive being around 12 i believe that sounded interesting before the weekend crowd which is awesome because you get more choices. n nmy first stop was at dieu du ciel which you know have really great tasting beer with not much aftertaste if you're a non beer drinker, like i am. i tried the solstice d' u00e9t u00e9 which has a sour note because of the raspberry. it is pretty good if you enjoy fruit base alcohol and are looking for something not too off putting. there's the brise glace which is an apple cider beer. a cider beer? i know! there's no words to describe it besides, fucking good! n nmy second stop was at trou du diable. a beerfest without stopping by them is plain stupid! any beer they offer is pretty good. i couldn't remember the name of it but it's definitely not the succubus as that one sold out pretty quick. n nthird stop at beau's all natural brew. definitely the highlight of the fest for me. i tried the bog water which is ok but the hogan's goat and especially the russian imp a black beer will make a beer lover out of you! n nfor my fourth stop, i made my way across the hall to the lovely peluso stand to sample the smoked barley wine from pit caribou that another yelper working the booth suggest me to try. if you are looking for something totally different to try, this one it is. there's that light charcoal taste you get at first and it smooths out once swallow. you'll enjoy it if you love bbq. n nmy fifth stop was at the brazilian stand where i tried some banana beer. it smelled like banana, doesn't taste like banana but there's a light sweetness to it that makes it enjoyable provide that you enjoy sweet beer. n nsixth and final stop was at the international stand to try some nogne brand beer. it's a norwegian beer brand and by that time, i was pretty out of it so i can't really remember anything besides drinking it all. n nUPDATE on my last day working the yelp booth, me and some yelper sample some more stands. At first, we were looking for a second round of la brise glace from dieu but they were sold out. kinda a bit bum, I walked over to our neighbour booth friend and asked if they knew about any other cider vendor which led us to la branche. The ice cider wasn't bad while the maple cider and the bubbly cider were hits amongst us. Before that, I walked over to the maple stand for some maple cider tasting. While I don't remember the name, there's one cider that had a maple butter like taste. It was rich, creamy and so ever smooth, it was like drinking liquid gold. Too bad you had to shell out money for a bottle instead of getting a 4 ouncer like most booths. And I went back to peluso for a second go at that smoked barley. I don't know if it was because of the maple cider I taste just before but I detected some lychee note amongst other things in the beer which I didn't previously. interesting n nfor food, i stopped by the globe trotteur stand to get some seal merguez and skippy burger kangaroo . it is a bit pricey for what you're getting the skippy is a slider even though it's pretty tasty. if i could keep on affording it, i'd keep eating skippy n nbad monkey popcorn is some freaking good popcorn! the ketchup one is not bad, a bit sweet like you'd expect from ketchup powder stuff. the jalapeno is quite spicy! me and some yelper choked on some kernels. the nachos and all dressed ones were the best of the bunch. considering it's 2 for 5, you can't go wrong with both. i did hear that they have some caramel and jalapeno popcorn which sounded interesting. n nUPDATE while I was enjoying some wine I sneak in from home had to drink something else too , I felt it was missing some cheese so I head over to fromage d'ici and got a trio of Roy Leo I think cheese plate. It was some good cheese but the mouthwatering one was the cheese fondue platter of the 3 cheeses that I got too. Made with some white wine, we just couldn't help ourselves. Words don't do justice of how good it was. You have to put it in your mouth to really grasp the collective mouthgasm we had! n nwe did get some freebies from our neighbour beer booth but that is between booth neighbours. n nmost staff working are pretty nice and friendly. we even got them to join in our photo madness! n nif you love beer or want to try something better than the non drinkable commercial stuff you get at grocery stores, you ought to attend the fest and sample. the best times are wednesday and early thursday where you can stroll around and hear yourself talk. i didn't really like beer but after trying multiple ones, i can definitely say it's almost love at first beer",2
If you are desperate and have no where else to turn. This come close to Chinese food. I suggest going 2 China One in the Smith shipping center. Way better food for similar prices. Actually I am holding back a bit. Call me a snob but Panda is horrible.,1
"Very cool venue for live music, mainly because it's small and you can easily interact with the artists. There's also seating, so if you get there early enough, you can get a seat. The pricing seems like it varies depending on who performs. I got to go for free so no complaints from me. They have a bar in the back and there is plenty of parking. When I was watching rehearsal, it seemed like the artists were having trouble adapting to the sound resonating back onto the stage, but once it went live, they sounded amazing. n nI saw a smoking area, which I didn't go out to, but I assume is where the patio seating is. I also didn't use the bathroom so I don't know how clean it is. n nOne of my favorite venues from Phoenix, since I haven't found many that I like",2
Definitely a MUST GO! Great food environment,2
Don't mean to sound like a total fatty BUT I've had a few things off their menu lol I have tried they're delicious mashed potatoes and they we delicious. The chicken strips and chicken salads are the best along with their pulled pork. The burgers are also great with a thick and juicy patty. The steak they serve could use some help but everything else is great even the chardonnay. Ooooh Oooh how can I forget about their desserts the cheesecake and brownies are delish!,2
"It's more of a novelty coming here especially if you want the Frozen Hot Chocolate. My friend and I split the FHC for 15. There are far better desserts to buy on the strip, even at 5 star restaurants, for that price and less. Something to consider. n nTo sum it up, the drink is an iced chocolatey drink. It's pretty decent although if you're really into it, there's an exact knock off of this recipe listed on food network. Google it. You're welcome. n nThe whipped cream on top was delicious, almost my favorite part of the drink. It's about a 1 1 ratio iced chocolate drink to cream. Before we dove in, my friend mentioned she should have asked them for no whipped cream. Excuse me? Who are you? n nThe chocolate chips that topped off the drink were not good at all. The worst I've ever tried but the rest of the drink made up for it. n nAll in all, I tried it and I'm done and I have no interest in ever getting it again.",1
"nice people. gross food. nI got an egg skillet and all I got was cold, rubbery eggs with what looked like left overs tossed on top. I was really disappointed because this place got such great reviews. My dad got an egg combo plate. same low quality food. Bummer!",1
"Der Filmpalast am ZKM ist eines dieser Multiplexe wie man sie kennt, viele Kinos u00e4le sind unter einem Dach untergebracht. Der gro u00dfe freie Raum im inneren ist schon sehr imposant.

"Invited by my sister and fiance to try the 20.13 tasting menu for lunch. Ambiance and decor were nice with a decent view of the strip. Our server was very good, overall service from wait staff was great. As a starter you receive a char grilled crusty bread and extra virgin olive oil to dip. It was decent but I felt the charred parts of the bread overwhelmed the fruity flavor of the EVOO. Toasted crusty bread with EVOO tho, very good. nOur appetizers were the calamari, meze plate, tomato salad grilled octopus. The tomato salad was mine, it had a good flavor. Chunks of tomato, a kalamata olive, capers, cucumber red onions slices tossed in a vinagrette with a triangle of feta cheese on the side to crumble into the salad. I had a piece of calamari, it was nice, crisp and not overly chewy. nFor the entree I had the lavraki mediterranean sea bass . It looks like it was cooked with lemon capers. It was tender, flaky and had a very mild and light flavor, very nice. The broccoli it came with however was fairly soft and mushy, too overdone. I had a piece of my sister's honjake salmon. It was cooked perfectly, slightly crisp on the outside, very tender and juicy on the inside. nDessert was the walnut pie with kaimaki ice cream. The pie's square shape and texture appearance resembles that of a piece of cornbread with a quenelle of ice cream on top of it. If you turned baklava into a cake, it would be this walnut pie. The ice cream had a hint of slightly bitter, earthy herbiness I couldn't describe. I had to ask our server and she said the flavor is due to it being made with pine resin. By itself the herbiness is a tad strong but with the walnut pie it compliments the sweetness. Not that I wouldn't mind sweet on sweet either but it was decent. nThis definitely isn't a cheap place ordering ala carte. But you do get a great value for the tasting menu, even if you do get some extras. nI was in between giving it 3 or 4 stars, no half star options here but the good service we received will get it a solid 4 stars.",2
I was here back in January with a couple who had always raved that this was a special place and I would say it lived up to their billing and then some. I counted 14 different amuse bouches served individually and in bunches during the 5 course meal. I actually felt that the 82 per person was a bargain compared to some of my dining experiences other places of course they have to pay much higher rents since Binkley's location is quite unassuming. I have to say that I will be visiting Binkley's every time I visit the Boulder's.,2
"place is clean, service is friendly, but i'm reviewing the baked goods and it just wasn't that great. n ni order the strawberry shortcake because it was the most popular item, and also an eclair just to try. n nthe eclair shell is standard and the pastry cream filling is grainy. boo! n nthe strawberry shortcake is, well, no better than grocery store stuff. the cake is dry and crumbly, and the filling of whipped cream, pastry cream, strawberries is nothing special. i have to say the best part about the shortcake is the whipped cream. tsk tsk!",1
"Sorry . Maybe my expectations were too high as many folks had told me how great this place was and specifically how great the BBQ was! In fact the BBQ spare ribs may have been the worst I've ever endured and even that might have been given a slight pass had the wait staff been even remotely nice or friendly . But that was not the case either so we had an awful meal, served by a staff that even a mother couldn't love and for this cowboy, I'll not be back . Ever!",1
It was a nice hotel but the service sucked. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Loved the free wi fi. The view was amazing. But all that to have bad service was not really worth it. Then be warned. They add a resort fee per person on the room. And the put a 200.00 hold on your card just in case you spend money on your room account. The casino was ok but the service there was nil. A waitress ran by with a drink tray yelling 'drinks' but never stopped to see if we needed anything. I had more fun at Ceasars and the Bellagio. The volcano show was pretty cool to watch.,1
"Great bagel shop. Good variety of bagels and pastries, delicious iced tea and their vanilla hazelnut coffee is my favorite! n nThe employees do a great job of keeping the line moving and getting your food quickly.

Went for a pedicure last week. The technician was very rough using the cutting tool on my cuticles. My nail bed at my cuticle has now turned black and is so sore. An infection is obvious and will have to go to a podiatrist for treatment. I do not think I will have a pedicure ever again.,1
Always greeted with friendly helpful service at this Baskins! The owner hires staff that know customer service. nThis Baskins has a great selection of flavors including all the latest. Frequent specials also keep me coming back.,2
"I found this company to be very unprofessional. They were disorganized and did not have set prices on anything in the store. One of the employees' wives was hanging out in the lobby, on Facebook and eating lunch. As there were only two employees working, we were forced to wait 35 minutes for them to finish with another customer. One of the employees had to constantly consult with the other in regards to pricing. All in all, I had a less than pleasing experience and I can't even honestly say that I got a good deal on my bike. Next time, I plan on trying Tempe Bicycle.",1
"Gas station coffee made with an oversized nestle coffee machine, i can make better coffee at home with my keurig, and the lady didnt know lattes could be hot, she kept asking if we wanted ice in it and overpriced",1
"make sure that you have your complete flight itinerary printed out before you get to the front desk. they will not rent to you if you have a debit card, even if you made reservations with said debit card! n i spent an hour and a half watching one customer after another go through the line twice. once to get their car, and then again to get another car that was not completely fucked up. nthe woman at the desk had no sympathy, she'd obviously been there a long time. it took all of my patience not to correct her on her etiquette and demeanor. nwhen we got our car the guy who cleaned and received vehicles advised us to get a different car because ours was dented and the ragtop was ripped. when his boss found out, he got chewed out for letting us know that we'd probably absorb the cost of that upon returning the car. nthis place is so totally crappy and shabby. pay the extra five dollars and get a car from the guys who are at the off site car mall. this place was off off site and it took us twenty minutes to get there. njust pathetic.",1
"I was a little leary after reading about the customer service. Wow, yes it's busy and the staff is squeezing through small passages since the tables and chairs take up a lot of room, but I have no complaints. The food was AMAZING, the drinks were strong, and the service was fine aka busy! HINT Go early or you will be waiting for a table. I would love to see them move into a bigger place, like maybe next to Postino's in downtown Gilbert! Hint, hint!",2
"Oh, yes! I'm definitely a fan of these so called 'soup dumplings'. n nOrdered the following with hubby tonight nCombo hot n sour soup w pan fried dumplings nCombo hot n sour soup w beef roll nsteamed potstickers n nHot n sour soup was delish and by far my most favorite of anywhere I've ever had it. nBeef roll was not greasy at all despite the way it looks yummy, but something I can pass on next time. The steamed potstickers were ok.I actually messed this one up because they are normally pan fried and I had them change it to steamed on accident I was really trying to order some steamed soup dumplings. Oh well, we'll just have to come back to try them another time cuz we'll definitely be back. n nThe star of our meal were the pan fried soup dumplings.I just wish I knew how to mix the vinegar, chili and soy sauce lol! n nI can't wait to go back and try the pork belly and bacon rice!",2

"We purchased a Groupon for CHop and thought to give it a try, convenient to our home, we made resevations for Saturday night at 7 30 for a party of 3. The restaurant's decor was very nice, typical steak house trendy. We were greeted and sat promptly. The restaurant was filled and very loud. Our waiter was very attentive, came over and greeted us, took our drink orders, and told us all the specials. May I mention the oddness of no table setup no napkins or utensils and no warm bread. OK, moving on, we ordered the Beef Carpaccio w Arugula and Capers 12, Chimichuri Steak Salad w Field Greens, Vinaigrette, Bleu Cheese 14.5, Steak Frites w Au Jus, Chop Fries 18.5, and a Bone In NY Strip w Seasonal Vegetables 38. All our food was perfectly cooked to the request. All the food tasted good. Were we blown away? no! What we were blown away with was the price to portions. The Bone In NY Strip small though done perfectly had very little seasoning. The steak salad meat portion was the same for the steak frites 4 small slices of flat iron steak maybe 4oz. that was it! We frequent BLT, Morton's, and Fleming's. We'll stick with BLT with it amazing view, unbelieveable popovers and complimentary appetizer and dessert goodies and their Bone In NY Strip with a choice of sauces if you like at 43. If CHop wants to play in the sandbox with the big boys then they really should step up their game.",1

The first and last time we went there was a spider in my moms rice. Could barely eat the rest of the night and the staff tried to act like they couldn't believe there was really a spider in the food.,1
"Total Shit Hole. I dined here alone on my way to the airport. I received the worst service ever! Im not too sure what this bitches problem was. i was seated by the hostess. I sat there for at least 15 minutes before I went back up to her to let it be known I hadnt received service yet. She was very apologetic. So, here comes the Wicked Bitch of the West. Comes over to my table and just stands there with her pen poised but doesnt say a word I order. I tell her in addition to my scrambled eggs and toast I would also like an iced tea. Her response ""I dont get the drinks "" ok this is just WrOnG! She sends some dude over to take my drink order like she couldnt have just said hey get her an iced tea. nSo, here comes the food. She brings my food out at the same time as the table next to me. She starts handing out the food to both tables at the same time. this bothered me. she passes my eggs to me in front of the mans face next to me. gross. nThen she argues with me that I ordered Wheat Toast when I in fact ordered White. Ya know what I'm not even gonna tell you the rest. nThis place sucks and thats that! nGoose Egg Bitch!",1

She dragged me over there promised that if I would try this fish cooked in Kim Chee sauce, that it would be the best fish I ever tasted. Yes, it was right up there! n nI tried to stick to pretty much brand new dishes like that, cheating with a few things like their amazingly good Sushi, I still got full before I could try all the great treats that were out.

"Below Average nMenu nHotpot 1 5 nService 5 5 nManagement 2 5 n nI had tried all three different kind of hotpot here. The plain one, the special and the spicy one. The plain one was average. Anyone who knows how to put water and buy all the ingredients at a Chinese supermarket can make the plain one at home. The special was awful. The pepper was floating on top of the soup and the flavor didn't simmer in as it suppose to. The chef pretty much just put in the raw Chinese herb material in and serve. The correct way should be cooked in the back with with a stock for several hours as a soup base. Not the case here. Same goes for the Mala flavor the spicy pot You have take extra effort to ask for the condiments such as satay sauce, garlic, chili sauce. They even charge you for the egg to put in your condiment sauce. How do people eat a plain taste of the hotpot without the condiment sauces? n nThe services was slow because they seem to be under staff. The waiting line was ridiculously long. There are simply not enough staffs. nHowever, we need to give their staffs a lot of credits for putting in the effort of putting up with some awful customers. An reasonable man screamed at the staff because he refused to give the staff his room number nor proper name to put it to his room charge. At the end, the customers starts screaming at the staff and no management was brave enough to tell the customers that he was at fault. I believe the cashiers had put up her best effort to do her job. However, the failure to see her managers to back her up nor stop the clients from disturbing other customers was a total failure on the management.",1
"Sub par food at rediculous prices. n nMy husband and I love Mexican food. We have tried several places since moving here a year and a half ago, and this has been the worst. The meat in my beef tacos had a really strange texture to it, hard to describe. I wanted to add sour cream, bill came and we were charge 2 just for that.

"It's been over two years now, so I cannot review the food in detail. However, let me review this place, the service, the vibe. n nThe service was impeccable. absolutely impeccable. The decor was out of this world, with beautiful tables, set apart far enough from each other, in such a way that every table can view the majestic fountain show in the Bellagio pool on the strip. The food. let's just say this is one of my top 10 restaurants of all time. The food was just amazing! n nWine list was steep. Entry level was 100 and went up from there. It was well worth it, however, and would go back to Picasso in a heartbeat. n nNote that nobody seems to have mentioned that this place actually displays original Picasso paintings in the dining room.",2
"Decent pastrami sandwich but the customer service was so blatantly bad it completely overshadowed the food. No hello from the hostess, sat down and handed a menu. No goodbye from what appeared to be the manager who made direct eye contact when I walked out the door. Server was rather rough around the edges and when trying to gauge size difference for a lunch sandwich I asked, ""how big is the half sandwich? "" and she replied, ""about half the size of the full sandwich. "" I look forward to reviewing the next restaurant that leases this space because with pathetic customer service like this, the business will not last due to so much competition at this price point in the area.",1

"We happened upon Miyagi's on Saturday night, and I was gleeful to find Charlotte had opened a new Korean joint. The interior was modern and trendy, and it was fairly empty, s0 we decided to give it a go. n nOur waitress was wonderful very attentive and helpful as we asked about the menu. The restaurant only just opened at the end of December ish, so they're still figuring things out for example, they have two different menus, one with appetizers, and one with small bites. seems like those could get consolidated or at least translated to be the same language . Additionally, the items featured are. interesting it's rare that you'd see pigs in a blanket on a korean restaurant menu, much less a place that doesn't cater to children. The menu s aren't yet final, but I believe they're working toward that goal. n nMy boyfriend got two of the appetizers, and the mandoo was pretty good. I ordered the bulgogi and was relatively pleased with the portion size granted, I was comparing it to two appetizers across the table, but still . While it tasted okay not amazing it was very oily and ginger was the dominant flavor. n nI debated between a 2 3 star for this review, and am sad that it ultimately scored this low. If they get the menu straightened out better, I think Miyagi's has a lot of potential, with the cool interior and great location. My fingers are crossed for this place to figure it out.",1
"Met up with friends here for lunch. They handled the lunch rush pretty well but nothing outstanding or unique. I got an Italian on wheat bread. The bread was soft and yummy, the very limited variety wise toppings were fresh, but the sandwich seemed scant on the meats. They were generous with the tomatoes and lettuce but the sandwich was still 80 bread. I had it ""Mike's way "", which also included what seemed like a pint of oil and vinegar on each side. The last few bites of my sandwich were soggy yuck! Price is high for what you get. Easy parking and average service.

Yeah, yeah.I can sign up for ""membership "" and be so special that I can pay 16.00 for the seat that doesn't recline. I looked at the memberships and wasn't impressed.

"DON'T GO HERE! I stopped by here not to long ago because there is no other Chinese food near me like this one and let me say the food was TERRIBLE!

"Very annoyed with the pushy sales tactic. Being a guest for the 2nd time of an owner we were interested in the timeshare so we were happy to go and hear all about it.

She slammed down her books and said ""I can't help someone who won't even help themselves "", I was stunned so I replied thank you, she said ""why are you thanking me ""?. OMG! I was sooooo mad when I left. I will never even consider Worldmark after that and I certainly will NEVER tell my friends about it.

You can't go wrong as the food quality is top notch and expect some of the best Thai you've ever had. It's a 20 taxi ride from LV strip and make sure and get reservations.

"I really like this place. It's not the best used book store I've ever been into, but it's a quaint little place and the people who work here are really awesome people. n nIf you are looking for used books of various genres nothing too old then this will be a great little pit stop. I like to stop by if I'm heading over to Viet Thai or Musashi's and I've placed a to go order I am waiting on. I took my grandmother here a few months ago and found a group of books from an author I used to collect. My copies have started falling apart and I grabbed what I thought I needed. Unfortunately it wasn't the right one and they had already sold the right one when I stopped by later to get it. So they kindly took my name and number and said whenever they came across it again they would give me a call. I obviously had forgotten all about it and then yesterday they called me up and said they had it behind the desk for me. How awesome is that n nThe prices can't be beat and you can really find some gems if you search. It is small as some people have claimed, but it's a great place to exchange books and find new things. I highly recommend giving it a try. I know one customer complained about there being too many romance novels and yes there are quite a few but honestly they have lots of other things too!",2

"Went there Saturday night the place was crowded. Its a very mixed crowd. The music was great played new and old skool music. I had a great time. I was not dress properly I had on shorts and sandals but he let me in because I was visiting. The place ended up getting pack around 10pm. everyone was having a great time. the whole ambiance of the club is class A. The drinks are expensive, so that's why I didn't give it a 5 star.",2
Definitely a must if you love ramen. Sora's ramen has to be the best ramen I have ever had and trust me I have been to lots of ramen restaurants and this one beats all! My friends and I eat here at least once a week because it's that good.,2

"My BF who is a Michigan fan and I went to the Upper Deck to watch the Stanley Cup Final. He had been here once before and was terribly excited to find the place full of Michigan fans! This event was no different.standing room only.however, the outdoor patio had a few seats open, so we sat there. n nWe were never served by a Server . After a few minutes, by BF went inside to get a couple of beers. From that point on it seemed the Server thought we were entirely self service, so never asked us if we wanted to see a menu, never brought a menu we asked the neighboring table for theirs when they were done , never checked back to see if we wanted another couple of beers, nothing. I agree with my fellow Yelpers, Gabrielle Z. and Tyler B. no thanks.",1
"It's my first time coming to this place. They do great service at excellent price. My car looks brand new ! My son told me that the car looks different I have plans of buying a new car but since I found this place I will just visit it once a month and have a ""brand new "" car after each service.",2
"This hotel is not managed like a five star hotel. There was trash behind the night stands, cracks in the lamp shades in our room as well as damaged shades throughout the hotel. I also found the room to be dirty around the windowsills and dust on some of the furniture. Our room was also not stocked fully with the normal toiletries. The ice maker on our floor was not working either. When I mentioned the outage to the front desk staff their response was told me that there was an ice maker on every floor and I was welcome to use one of them. I had to complain two different times before the problem was resolved. Most of the staff was accommodating and it should be noted that our tipping of the staff for their service was not affected due to the poor management of the hotel. If this is how Trump properties are run I would not ever consider staying at one again.",1
"We recently took our dog to be bathed and have his nails cut. Overall, that part of the experience was fine. The problem with my experience started from when I dropped him off. We had called a couple days ahead and made an appointment for or dog. I arrived 10 min early since it was our first time there and figured they'd ask a few questions and get him into their system. Over the phone they told us that it would be about an hour for everything. So as they were taking our dog back, I ask, ""so just come back in about an hour "". The staff member informs me that it would more likely be 4 hours. I left my mobile number and they said they would call when he was all done. 5 hours later we called, not them, and they informed us that our dog was ready to be picked up. n nSo, my ultimate problem here, and why I will not return to have my dog groomed at this store, is that I made an appointment and it took longer than they initially indicated. If you make an appointment, that should reserve your spot and they should take care of you at that time, not 4 hours later.",1
Have been here a few times. I like the atmosphere and the servers were very easy going and laid back. It wasn't busy so the service was top notch though I have been there on nights it was slammed and they still managed to do a pretty good job. I will decently be back. Don't take offense it that it's only a four star rating. It's hard for me to give a five anywhere. ,2
"Super bad service! Came in around 6 30pm. A lot of tourist bus were waiting in the front, restaurant was pretty full. So the server asked us to order after we sit for only 2 mins. Then after 10 mins eating, started to rush us to finish. Right after when we pay, while I was putting my card into the wallet, they start to ask us to sign the receipt. What a bad experience. Food taste normal, not special at all. Will not come again!",1
The place is closed.,2
Perfect! Went last night with a party of eight. This is my new favorite place! The sushi is amazing and everyone who works there is so friendly. We can't wait to go back! One of the guys in our party asked if they are open for breakfast! Delicious!,2
"Leroy Fox no relation! is a recent addition to the Cotswold dining scene, occupying the space which previously housed Hotel Charlotte. The focus here is on chicken and from the above fried chicken salad, Leroy Fox has their chicken recipe spot on. I also tried the shrimp wrap, which included chopped tiger shrimp and bacon. To me the bacon overpowered the shrimp a bit too much but it was delicious nevertheless and the zucchini fries are really something to try. For dessert I tried the tasty brownie sundae with ice cream a great choice for sharing. I look forward to coming back soon for the whole pieces of fried chicken. Leroy Fox also offers a kids menu and a gluten free menu. They are open late, serve brunch on Sunday beginning at 10 AM, offer live music Thursday through Saturday nights and have wine, beer and cocktails including special brunch cocktails.",2
This place is another gem of mine when I need my Asian food fixture. I love their thick green onion pancake since they make it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Highly recommend grabbing the green onion pancake as an appetizer. Their beef bun is also delicious the way they stuff it and pan fry the bun another must try. I also tried their beef noodle soup which I wasn't very impressed by. I like to think you can gauge how good a Chinese restaurant is based on their beef noodle soup since it the bread and butter of most Chinese restaurants. However I think where Chou's kitchen shines is in their handmade buns and dumplings.,2

Took my boyfriend here for dinner this past weekend for his birthday. They had decorated the table and had a hand written card on the table. We had reservations and were seated immediately. We had a table by the window as requested with a nice view. Server was very helpful knowledgeable of the menu. Hands down the best filet mignon I've ever had. Mashed potatoes and the cheesecake were great as well. Will definitely be coming here again.,2

"New bird owners stay away! Brigette will exaggerate if not lie about raising birds just to make a sale. We looked at buying a couple of birds and she told us they were easier to care for than cats and dogs. Ha! She took a deposit, but when we had to go out of town for a few weeks. The birds were on consignment. We said we could not take the birds apologetically, but she was rude and said no refunds. We stated that we could not give them a good home. My wife and I both travel extensively, and we did more research and learned that actually required more care than cats and dogs as she told us. She is rude. Honestly, I'm surprised they are still open. 500.00 gone.",1

Just wanted my sandwich made again. I ordered no onions with peppercinnis and I got extra onions but like 3 pieces of peppercinnis. I called them and they want to see my sandwhich because the cook states he didnt add onions! Really! Good thing I ate half. I saved my thrash with the onions and going to give it back and demand my money back. Or a new comolete sandwich. This is rediculous! Why would I lie about onions?,1

Not a huge fan of this place. There's plenty of other all you can eat sushi places Sushi Freak that serves similar items with better service. The time it took them to bring out cooked dishes was insanely slow. We ordered chicken skewers and it took about 30 mins to get there. We had to flag down the waitress to get our tea refilled but the only plus was we got our sushi fast cause we sat at the bar.,1

"I came across an article on Gallo Blanco and was intrigued by the write up that I wanted to go and try it. The chef is Doug Robson who was born in Mexico, and came to local fame as the original chef at La Grande Orange. n nOn a note of whimsy my wife and I decided to make the long haul from the North Desert Mountains down to that resurging downtown Phoenix area. Of course I'm always skeptical on the idea that down Phoenix is turning into a real downtown where people are on the streets after 5pm. However one has to be careful using this measure as a sign that turnaround is happening as no one is on the streets on a hot September night. n nUpon arriving at the address the navigation system lead us to, I recall thinking ""this just doesn't look good "". The building was one of those nondescript 8 story 1970's building with a ""Clarendon Hotel "" sign and in another boxy red sign ""Gallo Blanco "". At the door to the Clarendon was a glowing orb that was reminiscent of something Spock may have had in his bedroom during ""Pon Farr "". n nSummoning up the courage of the force, we got out and ventured into this quirky environment and I'm glad that we did. We entered through the hotel and the restaurant literally runs into the lobby although they are two very distinct and non related businesses. The restaurant itself reminded me of the scene in Seattle in the early 90's. It was youthful with a funky vibe going on and had Chicano art dotting the walls. n nWe decided to sit in the bar as it seemed to have a lively scene going on. Our waitress was a very hip and cool gal, from of all places, New Jersey by way of Colorado. My wide ordered the White Sangria and I asked our waitress what she recommended. When she said that they fresh squeeze all their juices, I immediately ordered a margarita. You used to be able to find a good margarita in this town, but now all you find is syrupy pre mixed crap. Well this, my friends, was a great and fabulously refreshing margarita. You just can't go wrong with fresh squeezed lime juice. n nAfter tasting the margarita I noticed that they also had Augua Fresca's and I had a feeling these would be good as well. We ordered the Honey Dew fresca and Wow, what a refreshing drink and not to sweet. nWe ordered some appetizers, as we like to sample a lot of different flavors at new restaurant. We started with the guacamole. n nThey charge for chips and salsa but if you order the guac they bring chips and salsa. The guac was very good, but the chips left a little on the table. Of course I am a chip snob and only fresh made chips piping hot ever perk my interest. I found these a little flat. The salsas were okay with the tomatillo being good and the red salsa being a little spicy but nothing stellar. They were also served in squeeze bottles. Guess the economy has impacted everyone. n nWe decided to order one more app which was the ""Chicarron de Queso "", or for the laymen ""Fried Cheese "". While this has nothing to do with Chicahrrones its fried Manchengo cheese and is really good, but extremely rich, which our waitress did warn us about. nAfter that we each ordered the entire line up of Tacos steak, pork, fish, vegetable, and shrimp . They are served street style with little fresh made corn tortillas. n nThe fish tacos were made with Alaskan Halibut and were delicious. The steak tacos had a wonderful flavor and the pork tacos created a ""tacos al pastor "" simulation that was devine with a fresh bit of pineapple to sweeten things up. The shrimp taco didn't disappoint, and the vegetable tacos were the surprise of the night with a wonderful fresh and inviting flavor. We also ordered a Mexican ear of street corn. This is grilled and rolled in some mayo and Cojita cheese.yum yum yum. n nAt this point we were just too full for desert. The food has a wonderful freshness to it and I would definitely go back again. We have heard that the ""Chilaquiles Verdes "" are really good as well. n nDress casual, adopt an easy going attitude, and leave all pretense at home and you will have a wonderful dining experience here. It does give one hope that central Phoenix may indeed be making a small comeback after all.",2

"In the words of David K, 'NPWH nice people work here .' n nThe friendly, pleasant matron of the house came and chatted with us after we stuffed our faces full of delightful Indian cuisine.

"I found Thelma's here on Yelp while in Henderson after a craving my wife had for good Filipino food. Being a bit skeptical myself when it comes to Filipino restaurants here in Vegas and preferring my wife's we gave them a visit. The location of Thelma's was only about 3.5 miles from our current locale and heading towards the direction of where we reside in North Las Vegas. Upon arriving at the address we discovered they are located in the rear, as the business post multiple suites via the same street number on Sunset. However once inside this was not your typical Filipino hole in the wall so to speak but a clean, spacious family dining establishment. Based on the reviews from Yelp I order the Pork Adobo Fried Rice and my wife had a combo plate. The host was pleasant and professionally apt to taking our order without flaw. The meal was delivered to our table within 5 10 minutes which I considered just great as this is not necessarily Mickey D's. I found the dish I ordered fresh and tasty even though the Adobo was prepared differently than my wives. I believe Star Anise may have been more heavily used than vinegar and soy sauce which I had no complaints with. My wife was just as pleased with her meal and didn't require a to go container. All and all we enjoyed Thelma's from the clean appearance of the restaurant, quality of the food and even appreciated being served on real dinnerware not styrofoam containers.",2

"I have to say the custom service is terrible. The young lady at the front desk can use some manners and some schooling on how to treat customers. She didn't greet me when I walked it or acknowledge me till I spoke to her. She looked very unhappy to be there. nAs I was picking up my dog later I noticed a male grommer handling a very small dog extremely rough. He was yanking the small dog by the fur on its chin. The dog was clearly scared and wanted nothing to do with the man so he tried pulling away. The man pulled at the leash around the dogs neck hard till another groomer jumped in on the action. She pushed the dog down to the table. Both groomers looked aggravated, at this time they both looked up and saw me watching. The woman took the dog to her table then camly pet the dog and finished the task at hand. I said something to the young lady atbyhe front desk and her response was ""that's just the way they do it "". nIt blows me away that it took two people to hold a small dog down to shave some fur off the top of its head and this is just the way they treat our animals. I can only imagine what they did to my medium sized dog. I don't think I will ever go back and wish I could inform the owner of the small dog.",1

"Burger 63 The Resort Burger n n NOTE nThis review is based solely on the fact that this meal was eaten inside the confines of a hotel. n nAfter setting up our booth, we were all starving and needed fuel before the meetings started. We asked the concierge where the closest grub was. Turns out, right below the lobby were a few places to eat inside the hotel. We ended up at Blue Sage. We ordered our food to go but then ate it there because it took a while to get it. n nTrying to maintain my shtick I ordered the ""Desert Ridge Angus Burger 1 2 Pound of Fresh Ground Black Angus Beef, Wisconsin Sharp Cheddar Cheese, and Applewood Smoked Bacon. 12. "" n nhttp www.yelp.com biz photos rxm3RZlb0reZDzCkKltow?select 8eo9QExFk3P30tBw364GzQ n nIt came with some super cute little jars of ketchup, mayo and mustard. All of which I took home as souvenirs. The burger itself was surprisingly good! They actually cooked it perfectly medium, the bacon was hot and crispy and the cheese was of good quality. All these are very shocking while eating in a hotel. But this is no hotel, it's a resort. Fries were good also but they sogged out a bit quick. n nThe next morning we opted to go back for a quick breakfast. They had a buffet, but I knew that would lead to over eating. So I kept it simple and ordered the ""Jalapeo Cheddar Biscuits Red Eye Gravy Freshly Baked Biscuits Smothered in Spiced Sausage Country Gravy with Two Eggs Any Style 13.

For 13 I expected something more, but this was in line with what I'd expect form a hotel. The biscuits did in fact have some little yellow lumps in them, but that cheese flavor was hidden. The ""Spiced "" gravy had no spice what so ever. My eggs were cooked perfectly though but that didn't really do it for me. If it came with some potatoes or fruit or anything to make the plate not look so empty, I would have been slightly happier. n nRegardless, the burger was good and eating outside watching the bunnies frolic is a great way to start a day.",2

"My husband and I take our kids to Uncle Bear's about once a week or bi weekly. We all love it. It's a great night out. n nStarting with the peanuts. Everyone loves snacking on them, and the kids ages 3 and 4 have a good time trying to crack them, then throwing the shells on the floor. n nI've tried several of their entrees and appretizers over the past year. I loved the buffalo wings and prime rib sliders. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was that the salad I got last time was boring and the ""blackened "" chicken was barely cooked. n nThe wait staff is always friendly and helpful and the rest of the food has exceeded my expectations. They have a variety of good food and drink specials, including ""kids eat free "" on Wednesdays. That reminds me, we forgot to go last night! Blast! n nI plan on continuing to take my family to Uncle Bear's and to try more of their food. I would recommend it to anyone that isn't pompous or uptight.",2
"They have an interesting selection of burritos i.e thanksgiving dinner, mac n' cheese . So a group of us went out for a birthday for a happy hour meal. We ordered drinks and then our food, so far so good. Drinks came back, I had ordered a well so I knew the alcohol wouldn't be prime, but it tasted pretty bad. My fault, I should've known better. Moving on, we get our food after a decent wait, it was pleasantly hot. So after it cools we dig in, the burritos lacked flavor, general consensus from everyone at our table. So time finally comes for us to pull the trigger and demand our tabs after waiting for our server bartender, the guy put it all on one check. Splitting the check was an extremely difficult task for him, commanding a computer to do it must've been too much for him to handle. After he messed up splitting it up a few times I questioned my total and he decided to return my question with a condescending rude response. Moral of the story buckets of alcohol aren't a good deal, the food is bland, and the staff are the worst part. Won't be going back. I would rather use my bucket to shit in.",1
I go here just for the fries and drinks.,2
"As stated in my first donut shop review Al's Donuts , I make it my business to hunt down the yummiest donuts in the area and 'Las Vegas Donut House' is my second stop. n nI picked up a dozen donuts around 10pm they open at 9 of a wide variety for 10 and had a couple negative experiences I've NEVER had from donuts or any food, for that matter . thus the 'Meh. I've experienced better' 2 star rating. For those interested, specific details are as follows n nAt home I dove into a donut trying smorgasbord and helped myself immediately to 4 n nFirst try maple cruller. I took a bite and immediately spat it back out. It has the texture of a stale sponge! I've NEVER taken a bite of a donut that had such an offensive texture. n nSecond try plain. Yummy! Just like cake. n nThird try cinnamon roll. Great cinnamon flavor and perfect outer layer but doughy in the middle. n nFourth try chocolate glazed and my second negative experience. n nMUCH to my surprise, my negative experience echos a previous reviewer's. initial bite was good but then I started tasting something strange. After concentrating on the flavor, it was very VERY reminiscent of PINE SOL! Not trusting my senses maybe I ate too many donuts I asked my friend to see if he tasted anything abnormal and he did, too! He was also with me when I purchased the donuts and he commented that it reminded him of the smell of the store and that he was suspicious of the donut quality upon initial observation and smell of the donut shop. n nSo, overall, I'm electing to not buy donuts from 'Las Vegas Donut House' again. I rated it 2 stars instead of 1 because the cake donut was yummy and the cinnamon roll was almost perfect.",1

"I work at a bank and 5 of my employees and I wanted to try them for the first time. What a disaster! They have no fax machine and in order to take pick up orders over the phone, they want your credit cards read to them on the phone. We simply went there and placed the individual orders and waited. n nThey were incredibly disorganized and seemed thrown by the fact that there were multiple orders. They apparently do not care to customize anything as they messed up every single ""special "" order we placed. We ordered a hot dog with mayo and cole slaw ONLY we received a hot dog with chili, cheese, and tons of onions. We ordered a double cheeseburger with mustard and cole slaw ONLY we received a cheeseburger with chili, cheese and tons of onions. The CHEESE fries we ordered came swimming in chili as well. Everything is covered and oozing with grease. Even the drink was nasty. n nI woulldn't be surprised if they don't stay in business much longer. Definitely not any place we will be going back to.",1
"So we just got back from an overnight stay with friends and have to say we are totally stoked about the care from Michelle fro Little Friends. n nWe're 3 months new to Charlotte and thanks to the reviews and a phone call to LFPS, we scheduled an evening and early morning feeding for my two cats. One of my cats is a Lil timid, anxious, and will hide from strangers. Michelle was not only able to keep her the cat from running, she got her to eat and be petted. and sent pics via text keeping me informed when she visited. n nThey were very flexible with the timing as we had to reschedule the overnight the night before and she completely helped and worked with us. When we got back we got a pet report of each cat and their feeding as well as bringing in the mail and packages for us. Completely thoughtful. n nLFPS is definitely our sitter and I will be asking for Michelle to be the cats new friend.",2
"I think it's very Phogettable. Tried their crab soup special which tasted more like some sort of spicy tomato concoction. Where's the crab? Also tried regular pho which was fairly mediocre. Bowl not that big, broth not that tasty, ingredients merely OK, and it's not that cheap either, and there seemed to be an unpleasant aftertaste for some reason.",1
"Solid 4 stars for sure. Yelpers led the way in my decision to come here. We were working in surprise and looking for someplace to go when this place was found. n nClean business, friendly staff, and since we were after the lunch rush plenty of seating. I ordered the bbq burger with a side of fries. I have zero complaints! Burger was cooked as requested and had great flavor. The star of the show was the fries as far as I am concerned. I could have eaten twice as many as I got, and I got plenty. They were great. n nIf I am ever in the area and need some food I am for sure coming back.

"Have been a Customer of Goody Twos for almost 2 years. The product is amazing and the twozzels are my favorite thing. n nI am writing this review today based upon the phone service I just had. This review in no way is for the product but only for the service I experienced. Today is November 17th plenty of time before any Holiday shipping dates. n nI called in order to place an order for 2 clients and than also 10 family members. I am extremely busy and use companies such as Goody Twos to fulfill gifts and presents i need to send out. When I spoke with the people who were working which I hope were not the owners it was made very clear to me that I would not be able to place an order due to that fact that their shipping department was full until January 1. As someone who was interested in making Good Twos a regular for my corporate gifts and personal use it make it extremly hard to recommend them and or use them for this in the future. To be told that they are not taking any more shipping delivery order for the next 2 months seems outrageous. n nI was offered the option to come to the store and buy product that i then could ship myself but due to the fact that they have recent moved locations to out of my way and the fact that as a business I do not have the time it seems outrageous to tell me this is my only option. n nI may be a little upset at the moment but I still feel it is outrageous to say you are closed for shipping orders through the holiday season. It is called higher another person, work on Sundays or work throughout the night. Why let business just walk out the door and leave money on the table. n nIf it weren't for the fact that my Wife absolutely loves the product i am not sure if i would go back. I know for a fact that i will not recommend their corporate gifts program to any of my business owner friends",1
"David Burke you should be ashamed to have you name on this hellhole! So we didn't eat here, we walked out after 15 minutes of waiting for the one and only waiter to even acknowledge us.

"Run the other way. Seriously. My boyfriend and I ate here almost a year ago and it still sticks in our mind as the worst place we've ate since moving to Charlotte. It's actually a comparison for other crappy restaurants ""Yeah, it was bad. But at least it wasn't On the Border bad. "" n nAnd the sad thing is, it's not that the place was disgusting or the service was terrible, it's that the food tasted that crappy. n nThe first thing we got was, of course, chips and salsa. I've never had chips and salsa I didn't like, until coming here. Seriously, how can you screw up chips and salsa? nThen we got some guacamole, hoping it could alleviate the situation. I like guacamole, and my boyfriend's addicted to the stuff. The guacamole didn't even taste like avocados, frankly, it didn't have much of a taste at all. nI ordered the Dos XX fish tacos as my meal. I like fish tacos, I like Dos XX, this should be good right? NOPE! After half a taco, I couldn't do it. The super fishy taste blended with way too much cabbage and some crappy sauce. The boyfriend got a steak burrito his staple at any Mexican restaurant. A few bites later he looked at me and said, ""It's just not good. "" After staring awkwardly at each other and the food, we finally asked for the check. The server asked if we wanted to a to go box. For probably the first time in my life, I declined. Because who was I kidding, this crap was unfit to consume. n nThe most surprising part Beer didn't make it better. And beer makes everything better.",1

"Oh my gosh. After today's visit, I finally understand the hype around HNJ! This place is GOOD. The only thing that sucks is the wait! So it's a good thing it's worth it! n nWe had a few people visiting from Texas, so my best friend Randy and I had to be strategic about getting a party of 10 people in this small space. Since they don't take reservations, I planned to put our name down early and wait before everyone else got there. The wait was at least 30 minutes when we got there. By the time everyone showed up, it had been 40 minutes, however, the hostess came out to inform us that they were preparing our table! Wonderful timing and within another five minutes, we had a table in the middle of the restaurant. n nThe food was delicious and with a large group, the experience was so much fun! I don't normally like getting dirty or using my hands, but with the bibbs, plastic gloves, cracker, sheller, and paper towels, it made dinner very enjoyable. I ordered a pound of the KING CRAB LEGS market price today was 25.99 lb with the Hot N Juicy Special all the seasonings combined in Medium. Oh, it was so tasty and those legs were huge! It was challenging with thin plastic gloves and legs with gigantic spikes, so I utilized three pairs of gloves and several paper towels. I think there needs to be gardening gloves and or real towels for those heavy duty crab legs! It can be pretty dangerous. Ruben and I also ordered the calamari and Cajun fries. All delicious! But that Hot N Juicy Special seasoning sauce, WOW. n nWonderful, wonderful place. The service was just okay, but I know they're busy and honestly, you're so consumed with wrestling crab legs that you forget your server hasn't checked on you. As long as they remember to keep the beverages filled, there's nothing lacking. Can't wait to go back!",2
"I travel frequently, work late, and don't always have time to make reservations before a late meal opportunity. We were greeted In an unwelcoming manner at 9pm at this Morton's.

The stuffy vibe needs to change for us to come back.Morton's is nice and convenient from the Ritz, but i'd drive the extra few miles to City Hall next time. nThe food was good although the Seafood platter oysters, lobster, crab were below average compared to other Mortons. Steak is probably better in the desert.",1
"I have tried Baja Joes three times and each time I had a bad experience. I know why would anyone go back if they didn't like it the first time. I went there for the live music and found there wasn't any other reason to go there again. It took over an hour to get my dinner and when I asked for chips and salsa, the server told me the ran out of chips. I get that they were busy and that is why I thought I would give them a second visit. Yes, the live music brought me back again and this time the service was slow and inconsistent. My friends all complained to me. Asking why I would bring them there. For the music, I told them. My third visit and I know you are thinking 3 times? I went only for the music and still had an awful experience. The server was rude and when I complained to the manager, he was just as rude and unhelpful. After talking with him, I can see why the service and restaurant is so bad. I will not be going back another time. I will not even go there to hear the live music! I would recommend that you go some place else!",1

"This place replaced the old Pickup Stix, redecorated the place but unfortunately the food isn't authentic nor does it justifies the price. n nThe server is extremely helpful and friendly. The portions generous but the flavor isn't there. n nFor 8.50 you have a good array of dinner menus to choose from and for around 5 for lunch. Specials include egg rolls, wontons, soup, choice of rice and chow mein. n nI ordered ""double cooked pork "", it isn't double cooked pork. Rather it is just some veggies bbq pork stir fry. It was very disappointing and they should not have put the name up if the item is not what it's suppose to be. n nMy friend ordered sesame chicken and it turned out to be orange chicken with about 20 pieces of sesame on one piece of nugget.

It doesn't get any better than with Prodigy Electric. I was selling a home and it was down to crunch time to finish requests from the FHA inspector. Both the realtor and I got mixed messages of what was required re an exhaust fan over the stove. It was less than a week from closing and work had to be completed. I called Prodigy Electric and was able to get an appointment the next day. Cody met me there really early and completed the job within a few hours. I thought the charges were more than reasonable and will definitely use this contractor again. Very professional.,2
"This place is what it is. Cheap. Decent equipment and it's all new. Treadmills and bikes are nice with individual TVs on each. However, there are not too many free weight options. Seems geared towards the older, out of shape crowd. not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just a little more motivated by fit people working their asses off. I like decent work out music with a beat, not Barry Manilow and Sarah McLachlan playing over the gym speakers. Which by the way I complained about and was told that they had to accommodate everyone's tastes. Middle of the road kinda deal. n nThe main thing that bugs me though is that in spite of the low monthly costs, I feel like I'm getting nickel dime'd. Sure it's 10 a month. But there is a 50 sign up fee, the monthly rate automatically goes up 5 a month after a year, there is an annual 40 surcharge and if you want to quit there is a 25 fee for that. Oh and if you do decide to quit, make damn sure you do it 10 BUSINESS days before the next billing cycle or you're in for another month. There is just absolutely nothing anyone can do about it. Yeah I know it's all in the contract, but it still chaps my hide. n nOh and what's up with the colors? I mean if you dig purple and green that's fine, but make some purple and green accents. You don't have to paint every damn thing in the place the most obnoxious, in your face shade of purple and green. n nI guess that's what you get for the low rates. Kinda like the airline industry. Cheap mediocrity with colors that make you want to vomit.",1

I have been to many clubs in Las Vegas including Marque, XS, Tao, and lights. I have been to Vegas 10 times in the past 3 years so I know the pros and cons of clubs. n nFirst The bouncers are not friendly. I try to start a conversation and I will be ignored and they are not polite at all. n nSecond The venue is really crowded with no standing room. If you do not have bottle service then this place is not for you. n nThird Water is 8 dollars and you guys don't offer tap water? I just spent 100 dollars on drinks and I can't even get a glass of water? n nIt is still a nice and amazing looking club but it would not be my first choice in Vegas.",1

An acceptable alternative is the horseshoe burger toast, cheese fries, burger . n n Second note Make sure you go to this location and not the one in downtown Champaign.

"I want to give some much needed feedback to LA fitness's corporate office in regards to a drastic change at the club located on 7365 N. VIA PASEO DEL SUR SCOTTSDALE, AZ 85258. n nRecently, a large area of the gym which was commonly used by countless paying members was roped off and plastered with signs restricting it's use to trainers and their ""pro results "" clients only. This is the largest area of the gym that was used for stretching and floor exercises. This location has always been extremely busy and any floor area is valuable. With this change, the gym has been further constricted for the benefit of few and at an added risk of injury to the majority of members due to the closer proximity we're restricted to exercise in. n nI'm not quite sure what prompted the drastic change to the location and the creation of a ""second "" class of membership to the gym that touts it's community feel I certainly don't feel like a part of a community. When I asked the sales manager, Griffin, about the change he said, ""it was directed by corporate "" and he didn't have any skin in the game in regards to the change. n nI hope you'll reevaluate this location's change, or like they say I believe members will vote with their wallet and leave to greener pastures.",1
"Las Vegas friends I don't usually make a fuss and blast a place but sadly my favorite Mexican food Don Tortaco has disappointed me. They failed to put all the food I bought into my bag. I discovered it at home of course. I drive back after a phone call for a refund request produced no results. They apologized, then gave me the food and asked for my card to refund it. They accidentally charged me again, and said they would cancel the transaction. They did not. I get home with the remade food and its terrible, I think on purpose. I have always loved their food and I couldn't eat this. I contacted them several times to talk to the manager to no avail, finally escalated to the area manager. He turned out to be a jerk too. I just wanted the 9.35 back that I was double charged. He told me to file a complaint through my bank. I told him I would make sure I told everyone I know about this poor customer service. I will also take this up with better business bureau. Sad. I also need recommendations for a New Mexican fast food, preferably with a drive thru. Customer service is key, as my friends have been pointing out, there are many other great Mexican food places in Vegas. Also my friends are sharing like crazy on facebook. Don Tortaco listen up! Its about customer service, not just the food.",1

"Outdated and busted up seems to be the best way to describe this hot house. A friend and I went browsing around the place and found two items within the whole store worth giving a second glance at.

"During a recent stay in Las Vegas, I sat in the dining room at Fin for dinner one night. I started out with vegetable egg rolls and crab corn soup. The egg rolls were delicious, the soup was a bit oily and bland for my taste. n nThe main course consisted of beef and broccoli and shrimp curry fried rice. Both were average and really nothing special about this meal. The wait staff were on top of everything with the one exception that I had to practically beg for a second glass of wine. n nOne last note, and I may have the wrong restaurant, but I really enjoyed this place about a year ago and they provided a complimentary shot of Bailey's and fortune cookie at the end of the meal sounds silly, but I was actually looking forward to it . So either I am mistaken and went to a different restaurant last year, or this restaurant that I would have given 3 4 stars to back then is now 2 stars.",1

WORST PLACE EVER! I had a hang nail in both big toes and not to mention she cut to low. She was rude. DON'T GO HERE!",1
"I live in the area and come to this mall only if I need to do some quick shopping. The mall seems small because there's not much to do there. Many of the stores are vacant and there are very few ""name brand "" stores. They don't have a movie theatre there anymore the one nearby shutdown and the food court is nothing special. I usually spend about 2 hours there, tops. There is a pretty nice kids area and a lot of kids were playing so that is a big draw for families with little ones. Overall, I wouldn't expect much coming here. It's not the worst mall I've ever been to but I much prefer Scottsdale Fashion Square and Chandler Mall, even though both are somewhat of a drive for me.",1
"I usually only lurk on Yelp but felt compelled to write my first review to warn others about how much this restaurant sucks. n nI gave up 30 tonight for what might have been the least tasty food I've eaten in at least 6 months. In fact, to say that it was the least tasty food I've had eaten in at least 6 months doesn't even begin to adequately describe the horrific culinary abominations I consumed against my better judgment at this ""establishment "". n nWhen I first heard about True Food, I was excited to try it out. With my pita, green tea soba noodles and chocolate pudding, however, I was incredibly disappointed. Actually, ""incredibly disappointed "" is an understatement. I was beyond disgusted. I do not like to waste food so I always try to finish everything I order. However, I was unable to eat all of the ""noodle "" dish. If I had forced myself to do so I fear I might have had to make a run to the restroom for a quick vomit before ""dessert "". n nThis food is not just subpar, it is a disgrace to the culinary arts in general. This is some of the worst ""food "" I have had the misfortune of choking down in my short life and yet they have the nerve to charge those prices for it. Perhaps they are charging for ambiance. The food certainly is not worth that much. n nWhen I had pancreatitis a couple of years back, I vomited bile the color of green antifreeze. I could not make it to a toilet in time so I had to attempt to swallow the bile. I can say with total honesty that the bile tasted as good as if not better than the ""meal "" I ate tonight. n nI would quite honestly rather die an excruciatingly painful death than ever dine here again. I am not exaggerating. I will be avoiding it at all costs and advising all of my friends to do the same.",1
Oh I heard these amazing things about the chocolate fountain! Ehh im never coming back again.people are rude here.Cursing and talking loud around kids.ya no thanks!,1
"My wife and I decided to try Red Lobster again after the horrible service we had about two months ago. It was a Tuesday night so no one was waiting to be seated but there was no hostess when we walked in. After five minutes, she walked out of the bathroom with another person waitress and then we were seated. In being seated in a direct line of sight to the hostess, she had to be in the bathroom at least six or seven more times and anyone coming in to eat had the same issue we did. We finally received our water after 10 minutes of waiting and then another 10 before our order was taken. If it was busy, sure but it was not at all. nBiscuits undercooked. nBreaded shrimp undercooked. nWaited 10 minutes after my meal finally arrived to get a baked potato. nChicken no flavor and tasted like it just came out of the microwave. n nTwo times in a row. We will never eat there again. The manager was too busy watching baseball to even notice what was going on, or just did not care. n nOne star for a nice waitress.",1
"Cool,very chic and modern place. I love all the amenities. Service is great. Only thing I have a problem with is you have to pay 20 to use the gym for one day. I don't need to workout that bad. O yea great breakfast well worth the 25 it costs. If your a platinum member it's free.",2
"I searched Yelp looking for Greek, this popped up and was near. Good decor and food. The staff was pleasant and place was clean. Was a nice small quality restaurant. Will be back n nIf in town you should try this place.",2
So very good sliders. The price is decent and I really like all the burgers and the sweet potato fries are almost like desert So good. The pulled pork is always out though but one of these days I will get you. They really need an Android app with working latitude to follow though easier than Twitter.,2
"For over a week I have been trying to get internet started, I go here, everyone is nice and relaxed, and I am given a modem, and told that my internet would work as soon as I got home. n nNO. Four days later, over three hours on the phone with Cox, I still don't have internet. Tech support tells me to contact the store, as they did everything they could do, and the lady didn't know what she was talking about and transferred me BACK to tech support! n nBelieve me, I will go out of my way to go to another Cox store, one where they know how to do their job. Oh, and the modem didn't work. Go figure.",1
"Me and some good friends were looking for a place to get a drink and enjoy a nice girl's night out. We certainly weren't deceived with l'Assommoir, on Bernard Street. n nFrist off, the bartenders give you a great customer service and are extremely charming. Brownie points for this! Which could very well explain why this bar has so many pretty women in it. n nBut let's talk about the drinks! Like someone said in an earlier review, they have over 300 different kind of drinks to choose. I happen to be the kind of lady that enjoy a good beer, and they had a few. But they really do specialize in drinks and liquors. I n nWe had to choose something to eat with our drinks, so we chose the ""Gueuleton "" which included some plantain chips, houmous, olives. it was good with my beer! But my friends, who ordered different kind of drinks, didn't enjoy the ""mix "" as much. n nThe food itself can be pricey. And we already had eaten, so this is why we chose the ""gueuleton "". But I would be curious to try their Tartare, nex time. n nThere also was a D.J. in the place, which was nice. The music was a little loud but you get used to it after a drink or two. p n nWe probably stayed about two hours. And we're defenetely thinking of going back for a longer night.",2
"Horrible place! Shady business practice! Do not take your car here unless you want it ruined! We used to go here regularly and the service was so so.we kept going back because it was a convenient location. Until one day, the guy moving our car backed it into something and dented the back of our car. We saw it and immediately freaked out, asked for the manager and all we got was the shift supervisor who said he has to get in touch with the manager.after a whole lot of runaround.we even called the goodyear police but they said it was an accident on private property the car wash and they would not be able to come out. We went back the next day, got more runaround.to make the story short. We had to contact our insurance and even with the major insurance company backing us, we weren't able to collect on the damage done to our car.They simply denied causing the dent. The General manager, Scott, is the biggest liar of all. So no surprise to us that they hire a bunch of shady people to run the business. We will NEVER use this business again and advise you all to do the same.",1
Overpriced and overrated buffet! The sushi section is 10x worst than Todai which isn't that good to begin with. The only thing worth eating is the sea bass. The lamb chop has no taste and the pasta is like hospital food. I have been to this buffet many times and the quality is getting worse.,1
"I hate to be the Debbie Downer, but I always thought their service is lacking. I come here every so often for lunch, and that's the worst time. I have to say they have gotten better, but for the most part they are still hit miss with taking order and preparing the sub the way it was ordered. n nCase in point, I was distracted by 2 people smack next to me having a conversation. I ordered my normal 38 Turkey Cordon Bleu half . Somehow I ended up being charged for a combo which I didn't say I wanted. And instead of taking that off the order, the guy behind the register just looked at me like ""well, go get yourself a bag of chips. "" And when I got my sandwich, it didn't have anything on it that I asked for all the way, no vinegar, with mushroom honey mustard . n nTheir system is so outdated, that after you pay, they gave you a real print out little ticket from the cash register, which you then have to give it to one of the 2 people behind the counter making the sandwich. This system would work if the 2 sandwich makers are spot on, but they normally aren't. n nHaving lunch should not be a frustrated event, and for that reason I think I'll at least give this place a break for a long while before consider coming back. If you want a sub near this area, just head to HT. At least it's cheaper.",1
"Healthy Life was my first experience at a ""foot spa "" and I feel like I found a diamond in the rough. I put ""foot spa "" in quotes because you actually get a whole body massage on these amazingly comfortable chairs that recline once the massage begins. There are probably 20 recliner beds in the whole place, spaced comfortably apart. n nYour face and scalp are started on first and all the while your feet are soaking in a warm tub of water. It's so relaxing in there with music playing at a peaceful decible level, although unfortunately it cannot drown out the sound of the dogs barking at the doggie bath place next door. I already knew from a yelp review before I went in that I would hear the dogs but I didn't mind. I'm not even taking a star off. n nI opted for the upgraded 30 massage instead of the 20 advertised rate because they use hot stones on your legs and feet. Once your whole body is massaged from head to feet they turn you over for your back massage AMAZING! Coming here is comparable to any high end spa for a fraction of the price and the staff are all very friendly. I tipped my lady 20 because to give any less, in my opinion, would feel like I was being stingy after such an amazing experience. I had a better experience here than even at Massage Nirvana. Wonderful place!",2
"Okay so I went to this place twice while on my weekend trip. First time was late night because we could not wait 30 minutes to be seated and then order. So we came back and sat down, looking forward to shakes and stuff. We come to find out that shakes are not served late night. Why be called ""Holsteins Shakes and Buns ""? So I order two drinks. 30 later. I was highly disappointed. n nCame back the next day for lunch. We did not receive any popcorn like the other tables. Is that saying something? We ordered shakes, fries, and wings. Nothing else looked that appetizing. Yeah my shake packed a kick but was soooo overly sweet cremee br u00fbl u00e9e. My sister got the oreo it tasted good. The wings were alright and the fries were a mixture of soggy and burnt. How does that happen? n nWe somehow lost our waitress, it was not that busy either. No water to start with and then after that no refills. n nI think next time I will just make my own adult milk shakes for a fraction of the cost. Though thumbs up for creativity the art work with the little piggy is cute. I wish I could give better stars and a better review but not this time.",1
"I just received rotten lettuce for the second time in a Kneaders ""salad "". This is in quotes because there is nothing in this ""salad "" but lettuce. It came with a side of dressing, so I guess that makes it a salad? It came as a side to my over salted, under chickened chicken salad sandwich. The last time I received a not insignificant amount of rotten lettuce in a salad from this location was in a turkey feta salad which was about 1 3 inedible lettuce. During my previous visit I ordered chicken dumpling soup. There wasn't enough chicken in it to even label it ""chicken "" so maybe it has this name because they use chicken broth? I've never been to another Kneaders but this location is extremely disappointing. I will not return and I will be shocked if they are still open 12 months from now.",1
"We really enjoyed the Van Gogh Live presentation they have of his paintings this month. Other then that, I really do not care too much about this place. I actually find the AZ Science Center as one big headache. Lots of walking around.for nothing really.

"While the atmosphere and view are incredible and the service was good amost too good, she wouldn't leave us alone for two seconds we found ourself caught up in what I can only say is a scam. First we were forced into drinking the WAY over priced Voss water because she said the regular water there wasn't ""fit for her dog "" we actually thought since the place was new that there was some kind of bug needed to be worked out . Actually, we weren't even asked whether we wanted water or not it was just poured. I even tried to block the attemp and she brushed my hand away. Great view but. over priced.",1
I love the bell!,2
"Perfect, Prefect, Perfect. This is an amazing restaurant. The food is perfectly made, the location is perfect and the service is perfect.

"Paid for a week in advance and upon entering my room I immediately had an allergic reaction in which I went back to the office and was told I couldn't get a refund but they'd switch rooms in the morning. I did not sleep there as my eyes got red and puffy and sinuses closed. I went back in the morning after a night of no sleep and was trying to have a conversation with the short blonde who felt like she needed to speak loudly so that everyone in the lobby could hear. She told me to check out and that I wouldn't get a refund, pointed out a no refund sign on the paperwork I was given and laughed about it. I was so extremely upset, sick, and tired and couldn't believe how I was being treated. I have not stayed there one night and will not get a refund according to the manager. This place is not worth your money, or your health, save yourself the headache and stay elsewhere. I'm a Vegas local and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had and place to stay in Vegas. Even if the property makes you visibly sick they could care less.",1
"This restaurant is an Ecuadorian restaurant whose dishes and cuisine are not at all comparable to what we think of as Mexican. The menu has a good variety of selections. Our waiter who may own the place was a delight and very especially since we didn't know anything about Ecuadorian food. My wife had a soup broth of shrimp and she declared it to be excellent. It came with a pretty mounded portion of rice to mix in with it. I had a plate called the flag which contained slices of marinated beef that were wonderful. Knife totally unnecessary. There was also a helping of hominy, fried plantains, potato pancake kind of thing with a delicious sauce over it. and several other things all good. The overall tone of my plate was a very little bit on the sweet side. We'll be back in as soon as we can and we're going to try to bring friends. nI heartily recommend this restaurant to anyone.",2

Just happened to find this place as a refuge from the rain and snow today. Thank goodness! It was great! nWe shared nachos and Mac n cheese. Both were great and the atmosphere is wonderful. nSitting by the window overlooking the street was lovely. Their claim for the best coffee was true! I have been travelling the USA for 6 weeks and the coffee is terrible. BUT here it was fantastic! At last great coffee! nService was fine and atmosphere great with quaint store next door.,2
Helpful and friendly service ! Would come back again and recommend !,2
I am an airline pilot. I have stop overs in phx often. I used to use the taxi service recommended by the hotel i use but the cars were old and dirty. I tried discount cab and was pleased with their newer and cleaner cars. Everything was great. Now all i get is horrible customer service. Takes forever to reach someone in dispatch. I waited 10 minutes before someone finally answered my call. The dispatch girl barely spoke english. She kept repeating the pickup address with no east or west designation even though I said EAST mcdowell rd. Sure enough im waiting and waiting and finally the driver calls saying he couldnt find the address. Turns out it was because it was given as WEST mcdowell instead of east. Unbelievable. Guess im looking for another cab company.,1
"great menu breakfast lunch and dinner. VERY cheap they deliver. I have eaten here on dozens of occassions delivery but today was the first time I ever went to the place to eat.Polaris is kind of an obscure street so I really had no idea where it was I kinda found myself at a deadend and it was sitting there in an old gas sttion kinda strange really. The place was packed for the lunch hour with construction workers from the area. There was plenty of seating with a few boothes, all with checker vinyl tableclothes TV's throughout the place. It was very busy but they had my meal ready very quickly. I ordered breakfast the farmers connection 3 scrambled eggs with diced sausage,pepper onion coverd in sausage gravy cheddar cheese with 2 pancakes 2 sausage links 2 bacon strips. It was way too much food but it was hot, crispy tasty. The service was very fasy friendly and the food was exceptional for a cafe I would recommend it.",2
"Been going here for a while, service has always been fast and courteous. And it still is, but i was charged extra for an oil change for having a 6 cylinger engine. I understand that upcharge fee, but the fact that I was never charged that before for the exact same oil change makes me wonder. Kinda sucks because I really liked this place and I live really close by.",1
"BBQ has to be one of my favorite foods and when a co worker suggested this place I was all for it. Living on the west side it was quite the drive but being that I am a BBQ fanatic I had to see what this was all about. n nFirst off Lucille's has a good location. Its located by Dave and Buster in the Tempe Marketplace. The look of the place is gimmicky but in a Famous Dave's kinda way. They have old school signs, mason jars to drink out of, and all the little fake things to make you seem like you have gone to Memphis or where ever they are trying to transport you. n nThe service was absolutely awful. It took way to long to get drinks and even longer to get refills. Attitude the whole time. Here is a tip if you want a good tip bust your butt. Then you will have more money to pay for your tuition half the staff is college kids . And do not roll your eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions. They tell you they smoke all their meats in house im not impressed. n nNow onto the most important part the BBQ. We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries. n nThe chicken was good. It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints. The portion size was good. n nBrisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork. That tough. Maybe over smoked? Portion size tiny. 4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long. n nRib Tips were dry and covered in sauce. Hardly any meat on them. Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat. But not this place. You get a scoop full. Boo. n nCollard greens were disgusting. Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter. Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right! n nSweet Potato Fries. You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen. So I would recommend these over regular fries. n nThe starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird. WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD. And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter. n nOne last thing the house and spicy BBQ sauce's main ingredients are CORN SYRUP thats how they thicken it! seriously that should tell you something. n nOverall two thumbs down. Stay away there are plenty of other great BBQ spots in the valley.",1
Beats getting sodomized. n nMake sure to check their webpage to get an idea of wait times.,1
"So mad we wasted 90 dollars at this place. Made a reservation over A WEEK in advance b c we live in Vegas and my considerate bf wanted to take us out for a nice brunch. Told the hostess I wanted a WINDOW seat and was willing to wait even though we had a reservation if it meant a window. Wait 15 minutes and get taken to a table even though Im staring at 2 empty window seats. Tell the hostess what I originally said. wait 10 more minutes for a window. 2 window seats available. One still has not been bussed but is a much better seat. One is in the corner meaning one persons view is of the wall. Ask for the former. Again, willing to wait. She comes back and tells me ""that table is already spoken for "". Guess they spoke for it more than a week ago since I had the reservation and noone waiting for a table was ahead of us but tired of waiting. And I'll go ahead and add now that that table sat empty for over 30 minutes so I guess the hostess decided we weren't good enough for that table? Waiter comes and is very nice, offers suggestions and we order drinks and food. Food comes about 15 minutes later and is wrong. WE NEVER SAW THE WAITER AGAIN! My boyfriend went ahead and ate his food b c it was getting cold. But that waiter never came back. Some waitress started helping us when we HAD ALREADY FINISHED EATING, pretty much 20 minutes and 2 empty drinks later. I am literally making eye contact with our waiter and he never came back. SOOOO. waitstaff is great if you can find them, and food was really good not what we ordered but we liked it. Overall service was so bad it isn't worth it. There are too many good places to eat to deal with this kind of thing in Vegas. I only give the 2 stars bc the food was really good. The service is BEYOND TERRIBLE.",1
Awesome iced tea. After a glass and half I was ready to conquer the world! I met the owner and his wife at a the grand opening of a charity thrift shop where they were handing out samples of their coffee and iced tea.

"Wanted to get a Flowmaster muffler installed and this was the cheapest place I could find to do it. I also read the other reviews and figured it was a slam dunk. However, not so much. When I brought the truck in to get the muffler installed, they said that the muffler was too big and it wouldn't fit. I would have to get the right size in order for them to do the work. So I called Wade's Discount Muffler Brakes, and Wade told me it wasn't a problem. Not only did Wade do the work, but he also only charged me 5 more. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THE WORK, THEN WHY EVEN BOTHER HAVING A BUSINESS!",1
I have never gotten a spray tan before and I am so pleased that my very first one was with Laura! She is so friendly and helpful. She is also extremely comforting and makes you feel welcome which is always nice when you are standing there while a stranger sprays you down. Laura talked me through which tone choice I wanted and we picked a fairly subtle bronze which was good for my first time so I wasn't too shocked by the skin tone change. I used a yelp deal which is great for the first two times. I have already made my second appointment and I will continue to return to Laura for all of my air brush needs! She really is a rockstar!,2
"Bachi Burger is one of those little places that you hear about from a friend. It is off the beaten path for Las Vegas but well worth venturing if you are a tourist or a local. n nThe menu is constantly being updated with new items. The general spin here is an ""Asian Fusion "" burger joint. Decor is on par with prices and it's always easy to get help. n nI really have to say that service at this location is top notch.

"This place is so yummy! nBeing an extremely picky eater, I was very hesitant to try this place. I had never had any type of curry before, and didn't know what to expect.

I'm not a curry connoisseur, this is the only place I've ever eaten it at, but it's awesome. n nPlus, everyone who works here is extremely friendly, and even remember my name which is awesome . They're always extremely patient with me as I struggle to decide between Chicken Katsu and Steamed Veggies my two favorites and even offer suggestions to help me be a little more adventurous ",2
"I chose Mon Ami Gabi, because of its Yelp rating and proximity to my hotel. I was not disappointed, and neither were any of my friends. n nThe food was excellent, though a little pricey considering it was lunch fare. I had a chicken sandwich with Brie, and apple slices. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I was actually hoping for brunch, which unfortunately they only serve on Sundays, but I left completely satisfied with my second choice. My only culinary complaint is with their 'french fries' which are super thin cut and crispy like chips. They totally suck. n nThe service was great, the Bloody Marries were excellent, and the atmosphere was inviting and unique.",2
This is terrible. The food is very bland and service is very slow. The employees act like they're the only restaurant in town. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.,1
"This is the second time I have been here and I have to say the second time was less than desirable. n nThe first time was amazing, very attentive staff. The facility was in great shape. A few years later and this place is run down. n nThe women's side showers were out of order, ALL OF THEM! we were escorted to a shower to use that was a quarter of the size of my hotel room shower up stairs, away from everything. Someone should really come in and renovate. Replace broken tiles, fix plumbing, etc. get this place back to where it should be.",1
"The only appealing part about this place is the 24 7 service. If you want a late night manicure than this place is basically the only option, however in my opinion it's better to just wait until morning so you can go somewhere else. n nGel manicures normally run 25 30, however at this salon it's 40. Which to start with is crazy over priced, but worse than that, the woman I worked with made me pay before I actually got any polish put on. It was very odd and very uncomfortable, how am I suppose to tip on a service I haven't had yet? Plus I feel as though you should always pay after so you actually know what you're paying for. n n My nails are nicely shaped and the police came out with the good strong color I was hoping for. However none of that was really the manicurists doing, my nails were basically already shaped and I picked red polish, you can't really screw up that color. n nThe manicure portion of the manicure was quick and to the point, she even almost forgot to buff my nails and had to call me back before I washed my hands. n nAs I said before the polish came out on well but at the end there was no lotion or hand massage that you would normally get. So I basically dropped 40 just to get my nails painted. Which in my mind is a rip off since I can get that and more for 25.",1
"People must HATE working on New Years Day. Dingy ass workers at Starbucks couldn't get out order right. Dude reading a magazine at Tap Out didn't give us any customer service. Guy at Lids was cool. Lazy ass lady at the oxygen bar didn't acknowledge us until 5 minutes later there were NO customers . ""Do you have any questions? "" She said finally. ""Not from you, "" I replied and walked away.Then when we went to board and the bitch at gate B14 flight 3527 was like, ""You have to line up in numerical order.

"Lee's is the best privately owned ice cream parlor in Scottsdale! Located in Old Town Scottsdale in the heart of some prime dining locations, Lee's is a great night cap in the form of ice cream, a superb place to bring a date or all in all just a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy some ice cream con alcohol. n nLet's start with the aesthetics Lee's offers a very clean, small, cozy environment. A few table and chair sets dot the inside and a couple more to match on the outside. Lee has some awesome glass vases on the wall that add a modern touch. She has a few large clocks with different time zones so you know what time it is on the east coast while you eat? I dunno the clocks were kind of a head scratcher. n nThe Service is spectacular! Lee is the only help I've ever received there, so I am not sure if she works alone or has help. She is always timely and prompt to greet and serve you and automatically starts you off with TWO samples of which ever flavors you would like. All the young ones like myself be prepared to show ID, although you would have to eat a lot of ice cream to get loaded, Lee doesn't skimp on the booze either. Lee is usually a bit on the quiet side so you gotta listen up and be as patient with her as she is with you. The lady is running the joint by herself! n nThe Product is what makes Lee's so good! Her ice cream flavors are inventive and wonderful. There is usually new options as well a few solid customer favorites too choose from. As pre mentioned Lee does pack a fair amount of liquor in her ice cream so some of the flavors have a stronger alcohol flavor than others. The Jack Daniel's chocolate swirl is my personal favorite and has the perfect amount of bourbon to chocolate ratio to make a unique, delectable treat. Lee does offer non alcoholic flavors at a discounted price, too! for those opt to take there alcohol and ice cream separate. The cookie dough flavor may be the best ice cream I have tried with or without booze.",2
Blah Can't really expect much from a Hotel Caf u00e9 in Vegas. does anyone know of any good 24 hour hotel caf u00e9s in LV? n nMy friends and I went there for lunch when I was drunk off my a from playing Beer Pong at O' Sheas yes we started drinking around 10am I ordered a barbeque bacon burger and thought it was SOOOOO good! I remember taking quite a while to get our food but I guess I didn't really care when the food came. I devoured that burger in less than a min. n n. n nMy friends went back there after a long night partying at XS. We went back to the room at the same time they got to the caf u00e9. They came back more than 2 hours later b ching about how long it took to get service. WTF? 2 hours? I'm glad I got extra 2.5 hrs of sleep while they were trying to get food! n n. n nYet we gave them another try. well more like we had no other choices. It is no wonder that these caf u00e9s don't even have to try hard. They get customers that are desperate to eat all the time! I decided to go for the safety and order the same burger I ordered before. I guess I was REALLY wasted when I had it the first time because even the nastiest things you could ever eat LIKE THIS BURGER will taste good when you're drunk!,1
"Both of our sons went to PVCP since 1st grade. We found the teachers to be excellent. Our oldest son had a small class and was very well prepared for High School. Our youngest has some Mild ADD and a little different learning style. While not all of the teachers were able to accommodate him most were more than willing to give him extra time and help with assignments. This school isn't for everyone, it is like a small town community, which we loved.",2
"Not worth the money but I would reconsider staying again for the following reasons nPROs n Blue Ribbon Restaurant was delish! The Gindara Saikyoyaki miso black cod was my favorite! It was cooked to the perfection which melts right in the mouth. n Marquee, one of the best day and night club in Vegas! n it was very convenient to book our stay there, so we could arrange everything within Cosmo without worrying about taxis and drunken girls n loved the antique and modern decor in the room. n nCONS n housekeeping not up to standard for the price of this hotel. I've stayed at other hotels where they restock all the toiletries when it is halfway full. They would fold the clothes from the floor and put it neatly on a chair or bed. Neaten up the mess on tables, floors, and change the mugs in the room daily. Unfortunately our housekeeper did not do any besides making our bed. It is very aggravating running out of shampoo, conditioner, body wash in the shower. I also left a gel eye mask in the refridgerator, which was gone the very next day. I assumed it was thrown out. but why would you throw that out? There were plenty of trash in the room that should've been thrown out but yet my gel eye mask was thrown out? n long check in line n i called rom service for hot water and I was told it will take an hour and 15 minutes! WHAT? All i wanted was a hot water. unfortunately, i couldnt wait and never got my hot water. n nI hope if i ever stay at this hotel again, I will see a big improvement from all the cons i have listed.",1
"What a scam! We bought the travelzoo voucher for 20 all you can drink. When we arrived we were really disappointed the way the pool area was set up, there wasn't any sun because Palazzo was blocking the sun! I mean who constructs a pool area behind a 30 story building? And this is where it gets really interesting, we got in the pool area all of the chairs had ""reserved "" signs on them, so we asked how much, 100 A CHAIR! and that was then followed up by, ""you can sit on the side of the pool or lean up against the wall "" are you kidding me? We went to get a drink, and when I say the alcohol was bottom shelf, I'm being kind. The pool employees all had attitudes and were very rude. This place is a joke.",1
"Big Horn Casino is a small neighborhood bar diner casino. I like going because it is VERY close to where I'm currently located. I also like their 24 hour food specials. Unlike the strip or even downtown, you can go in any time and get their food specials. However, you have to either look at the signs outside or ask the server because the specials are not mentioned on the menu or even on any kind of placards on the tables. n nAs for the gambling, I enjoy playing slots and there are a limited number of machines due to the location being rather small. Then again, that's why it's a local ""joint. "" I usually go Monday through Thursday. I tried going on a Friday night around 6 30pm and couldn't even find a decent parking space, so I just left. n nOh and I love that they sell Modelo and Corona's for only 1.00 per bottle.that's the price at the bar or even in the restaurant. Heck, cheaper than a cup of coffee! n nOverall, it's not bad for what it is.a local gambling joint.",1
"Parents were in town for the week and decided to try Block and Grinder out. Really enjoyed when they had the butcher shop on Selwyn, so already had a feeling it was going to be good. n nWe tried everything.started with the deviled eggs, pork belly, and the ribs. Deviled eggs were creamy, yet you had a nice crunch with the prosciutto. Pork belly pancakes were unreal! Pork was cooked perfectly with a nice crunch and savory glaze. Could of sat there and eat those all day. Lets not forget the ribs, which fell right off the bone.couldn't believe we hadn't had the entrees yet! n nYes there is more.we got the wild game meatloaf and the shiitake and gruyere burger. Meatloaf was delicious.eating that with the mashed potatoe croquettes, which were crispy on the outside and smooth very flavorful on the inside. I couldn't have asked for a better steak burger.which brings me to my next point, once you go steak burger you can't go back. No more ground meat for this guy. Great meal! n nReady to go back and try the rest.love the concept!",2
"I had an awful experience with this company. First, the owner Faisal was very hard to get ahold of and wouldn't return my calls about the initial appointment I had set up through DealFind. He showed up an hour early without calling and finished within 30 minutes. I've never had anyone clean over 1000 sq feet and a sectional couch in 30 min! It seemed like he just wanted to rush through the job. When I saw the job he had done, I was very upset. The carpet not only looked the exact same and still had spots, but the next day it was extremely stiff a sign that too much soap solution was used during the cleaning. He had charged me an additional 172 added on to the price i had paid on DealFind for the service. This was also a rip off because when i initially called to set up the appointment, I was told everything would be included in the voucher i purchased off of DealFind. On top of all that, he promised me he would return the check I had written him as a refund for the poor job he performed but ended up cashing it anyway! PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!",1
"The Common Market is a magnet for the more interesting, artistic sort of people in Charlotte. This location, nestled into Plaza Midwood, accentuates this fact with crazy things hanging on the wall, live music on occasion and a broad variety of beverages ranging from off brand cane sugar sodas like Boylan to PBR to tasty Belgians and beer snob can appreciate. n nThere isn't as much sitting room inside at this location as the Dilworth location, but its still a nice hangout.",2
"I just realized I did in fact go back for the burger and forgot to tell yelp about it! We dined in the lounge. The burger was at the top of our list but craving foie gras as well we decided to get one foie and one burger to share. n nThe foie was one of the coolest foie preparations I've ever had. It had a peanut butter mousse and a pomegranate jelly and toast. Sort of a pb j take on it. MMMM n nSo I'm on the fence on whether the 29 burger salad dessert is a good deal vs the 19 burger. The pudding and cookies is downright incredible and probably worth the 10 to me, but the caesar salad was boring. I guess that's a decision you'd have to make for yourself! n nThe burger was definitely amazing. Merlot butter. yup, f ing MERLOT BUTTER is on this burger. The beef is rich and delicious and he forms it with the perfect blend of sirloin ribeye etc to make sure it's fatty and delicious. The bun is perfect. The cheddar cheese is perfect. Is it worth 19? I dunno, it was to me but I know some people just wouldn't get enough enjoyment out of it ! Is it the best burger in Vegas? It's definitely in the top 2 sorry, I love my kobe at Burger Bar too much to just overlook them . n nOh lastly I'd like to add dining in the BO lounge is a great way to have a relatively cheap special dining experience. We ate here for our anniversary before going to see Elton John and were pleased with how far our 100 took us. Drinks, bread, yummy foie gras and a HUGE gourmet burger. Oh and salad and bada dessert too. n nIf you've been dying to try a piece of BO but can't justify his 100ish per person price tag, pony up 20 for a burger !",2
"Disappointed. New owners and new menu. Food is still good, but the service and ambiance went down hill. We couldn't figure out why there wasn't an hour wait on a Sunday to begin with, then our food was different, and the service was very slow and a little unpleasant. Then my fianc u00e9 asked if the place was bought out and they said yes, about three weeks ago. Again, the food was good but you get a lot less of it for the price. .",1
"I felt like I was the Millionth Customer and not in a good way . Waited a while to be seated while employees stood there trying to avoid eye contact. My husband ordered a coke. The hostess brought it and said ""It looks flat. Taste it to see if its flat "". It was flat. After we both got our iced teas, we ordered. He asked for the chicken club with fries because they were out of onion rings at lunchtime and I ordered the mini mahi mahi tacos and a cup of french onion soup. While we were eating, we got to watch the hostess cruise around chewing her gum with her mouth open and blowing bubbles. The food was pretty good. The french onion soup was very rich and good. Hubby said the in leiu of onion rings french fries were super good. The lady at the cash register did ask if I had a players card, so I got some points out of the deal. Our bill was 40. Kind of steep for a diner experience.",1
"Sunny side up eggs were perfect which is not all that common. Thick cut peppered bacon was perfectly crispy, thich cut rye, and amazing rosemary potatoes. Coffee refills were also served promptly. This place in the airport rivals some popular breakfast joints in Phoenix.",2
"Pane Bianco is a refreshing breath of air. n nAfter having a bad experience at Pizzeria Bianco, I was pretty hesitant to try Pane. My husband talked me into going, and I'm really glad that he did. Restaurant is located next to Lux, so parking is shared either the small lot next to behind the building or along the street . n nI really like the decor. The seating is mostly large tables with chairs and benches. It's dimly lit, with a small bar and a separate to go section. Menu is small but sufficient and good. I like that you can order a pizza in addition to trying something a little different from Pizzeria. n nEggplant parmigiana is lovely. It's small but rich, with a wonderfully crisp topping and rich eggplant inside. I like that it isn't bogged down in marinara and cheese. The honey lemon chicken is amazing. The chicken is extremely tender, and the accompanying apple slaw and potato salad are refreshing and delicious. The plating is very rustic, which I like. n nService was good. We had a great time. I can't wait to stop in and try lunch sometime.",2
"Tucked away in the strip mall, this small Cuban bakery has been overlooked and undervalued by many who don't frequent the area or knows very little about the cuisine. Once inside, there are only six small tables. The red tablecloths, glass dessert counter, tiled floors, and bright natural lighting coming through the doors nicely accentuated the d u00e9cor. Fellow Yelper Kurdy S and I were the only non Spanish speaking customers during this afternoon. Like many of the nearby restaurants, the atmosphere was fitting as a casual lunch spot. n nFor appetizer, we shared the Tostones Rellenos de Roja Villeja 4.49 . The plate came with four fried green plantains holding a small scoop of tender shredded beef on top. The plantains had great texture on the outside to add to the soft green banana flavor on the inside. The beef was tender, flavorful, complex, and very nicely seasoned. I can eat these all day long. n nWe also had a side order of Plantanos Maduro Fritos 2.49 that came with soft bananas served piping hot, perfectly fried, and sweet. It was nicely glazed, but also unexpectedly oily. n nNext, the Cuban Sandwich 6.95 came with shredded beef, ham, and mustard. The bread had an awesome crunch with an excellent secondary chew. The sandwich was big enough to share and the dish also came with French fries. The way they kept it simple without all the fillers made this one of the best Cuban Sandwiches I've had so far. n nFinally, the Filete a la Plancha 9.99 came with a big serving of grilled sole, black bean rice, and salad. The sole was fresh, moist, tender, and had good flavor but slightly over salted. The black bean rice had great flavor and moisture much better than the one at Victor's 1959 Caf u00e9. The lightly dressed salad provided a nice change of pace to the sole. n nAntithetical to the cuisine's longstanding stereotype of being bland, this place simply rocks. Service however, was friendly but also inattentive, offbeat, and at times awkward. For instance, the food and bill took forever to come, and our water was never refilled even though the restaurant was not busy. Despite the shortcomings, interested diners should still come for the impressive lineup of dishes and great prices. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their other seafood and chicken items followed by their great looking desserts.",2
"My daughter and I went a couple of days ago for lunch. We were using a groupon. I ordered the ""teriyaki "" salmon and my daughter had the spicy tuna roll. n nI must admit, I've had better at a MUCH cheaper price! The salmon was grilled farm salmon, very bland, and on the side was a dish of what appeared to be bottled commercial teriyaki sauce. It was very thick and ho hum. n nMy daughter's sushi was nothing special. n nThe service was great. I think the only thing we were paying for was the beautiful bathroom!",1
"It took me several years to find a family doctor that I could truly trust. I found Dr. Goldman about 2.5 years ago after having a severe allergic reaction and he was able to help me pin point the cause and put me on a path to recovery. Dr. Goldman and his nurse Maddie are truly great! nI am saddened to say I am now leaving this practice because of a silly Admin fee they have now introduced along with a calling list they put their patients on to receive recorded advertising messages of medical services they provide. Really, you want me to pay 49 a month so you can send me infomercial voicemails to spend more money at your practice?!?! I am generally a healthy person and maybe visit the doctor once or twice a year. They already bill my insurance up the wazoo and also charge me a co pay every visit, is that not enough? Maybe if this doctors office was a luxurious spa, with outstanding customer service, would I consider spending a yearly fee.",1
"I am giving this place five stars because it delivers what it is supposed to.fast, fresh, healthy and tasty food. It is our go to spot for food to sneak into the theatre. It is consistently good.",2
"I've been here several times. I have zero problem with the food itself in fact I crave the stuff. The issue is with staff. Both times I have had a dining partner and we have paid together as a couple. First visit we used two cards for our food and my partner was harassed on the way out for ""not paying "" so I had to show my receipt to remind them that I had paid for her meal. Trying to avoid humiliating my dining partner the next time I went, I politely declined the second card when I arrived and was chastised loudly with, ""EVERYONE HAS to have an individual card "". So as we leave. Guess what? ""Ma'am. You have to pay "". I'm done here. The chefs are slow, hard to understand you're speaking over a counter in a crowded restaurant.stop murmuring , the service clearing tables is slow on busy nights, it's impossible to get help from wait staff to clear tables, and the hostess has accused me of theft for the last time.",1
Old and under construction. I remember the good old vegas days when this place was the focus of attention. n nNow you can't even get near the sidewalk because their is so much construction.,1
"Lame, pointless and annoying. n nI'd like to review the food but I didn't even make it in. We wanted a cheap buffet on our last day in Vegas and this one seemed to fit the bill from the listing in the magazine from our hotel. 7.99, why not. n nI'm mobility impaired knee trouble but the walk in from valet was easy. Waiting in line got a bit tough but we got to the cashier fairly quickly.only to be informed that we needed a club card or it would be an extra 5 each. 5? There was an upcharge at the Flamingo, a whopping 1, which we gladly paid to avoid the hassle of a new club card. So, off I gimped to the club signup area only to wait in line 15 minutes with only five people in line. While there one of their VIP clients came up but the one person dedicated to that area spent about 5 8 minutes trying to get a printer to work, totally ignoring the VIP the entire time. n nFinally I get to the front and get a card. I gimp back, now painfully, to the buffet. My wife and kid are already there. As I walk up, the cashier says, ""one club card, ONE discount. "" I blew my top. EVERY person needs a club card or they'll be charged 5 extra? Was my kid supposed to sign up too, seeing as she's 10? We left, and went back to Ellis Island which had treated us well the night before. n nCasinos offer buffets to get people to check out their casinos. Well, we went, and quickly saw the worst of the Palms. If they treat potential new customers poorly and keep VIPs waiting, why would anyone want to go there?",1
"Came here the other night for cheap, fast food wasn't disappointed. A friend and I had a couple of small plates to start things off with some really excellent fish and salad on the go, and then both had Massman Ped for our 'mains'. This was an excellent curry, and pretty cheap for the amount we got. I think the restaurant would benefit from a better beer list the Singha on offer wasn't the best, some craft beers wouldn't hurt , but overall this was a great wee place with a friendly buzz about it.",2
"I walk past this bar daily, as it's centrally located on Leith Walk, and I have to say I'm always receiving the creep vibe. n nOn paper, it has everything going for it it's got a great location, isn't too small, and it quite nicely decorated with comfortable leather chairs and modern decor. However, there are ALWAYS creepy men walking in, out, or even more worryingly sitting or standing by the entrance. I've been in there to hand out Cvs quite a while ago, before I knew ofcourse about The Vibe, and very little would make me head back there. n nThe drinking does start quite early in there, and amongst the more bothersome clientele, I have spotted a family or two in there enjoying a drink. so I GUESS you'll make it out there untainted, but I wouldn't venture it.",1
"My boyfriend made reservations here for a special Valentine's Day dinner. Even though we were a few minutes late, we were seated right away. The service was excellent friendly, helpful and attentive. And best of all, no attitude. n nFor the first course, I had seared scallops which melted in my mouth . My boyfriend opted for the salad. Then we were presented with celery root soup compliments of the chef. For the next course, I had the house made cavatelli with pork sausage, and my boyfriend ordered the pork loin. For dessert, we shared some homemade caramel ice cream. Everything we ate was amazing, and I couldn't wipe the smile off my face the entire time! n nThe cocktails were excellent as well. I had a Canton sidecar which went perfectly with the scallops and an elderflower gimlet. n nThis place is fantastic. I will definitely be coming back.",2
"Went here on my sister's recommendation, as she adores the Santa Monica Location. However, even she agreed that this particular place was not up to par. n nIn any case, the highlight of the evening was the steak itself. Cooked as requested, my dry aged NY strip was tasty. Also, the service was appropriately attentive and friendly. Outside of that though.little was going right that evening. n nThe first issue came up when I scanned the menu. Cool, you get to choose from a variety of steaks, from traditional corn fed to ""organic "" to , uh oh, Kobe. Intrigued by the organic offering, I kindly ask our waiter if he could tell me about where they get their organic meat, and if he could tell me if it's partially or completely grass fed. After hemming and hawing for a bit, he says, 'actually, I don't know.let me go check.' After a couple of minutes, he comes back and tells me that he's unable to find further information about the organic beef, and how it's raised. n nRed flag on the play, 10 yard penalty, still first down. Sounds like there's more marketing on the menu than actual care put into the beef. Suddenly, the Kobe and Organic offerings don't appeal to me anymore. If they don't care enough to know the origins of their specialty meats, how can I possibly expect them to cook them properly? To give them the benefit of the doubt, I went with a traditional corn fed steak A good move, as I mentioned earlier. n nIt comes with a selection of sauces, and I decided to go with Bernaise.as it's always a favorite accompaniment of mine. To start with I ordered up the Steak Tartare prepared tableside.I was in a beefy mood, what can I say? n nThe tartare came, and it wasn't anything special. They included a quail egg, which is no big foul, but I've always preferred a good amount of yolk to accompany my chopped beef. Also, it was doused with olive oil and set on top of bitter greens, and served with toasted baguette. In the end, the preparation masked the pure beefyness that is the only reason for ordering tartare in the first place. I still long to find the yummy baseballs of fillet and yolk that I'd get in most any Parisian Bistro. n nOn to the NY Strip. Got it with a side of asparagus.limp and stringy, someone forgot to peel the bottoms. Got to the Bernaise.but it was just way too buttery and missing the balance of a good Bernaise. I guess they really must be afraid of egg yolk in this joint. As a backup I tried their J 1 sauce.hmm, it's just like A 1 except not a sweet. Okay, never mind then, I'll just skip the sauce and go for the meat. n nIn the end, the faux Laguiole steak knife on the table pretty much summed things up. Most everything looks pretty and sounds good.but there just isn't enough substance and care put into the food or the cooking for me to really enjoy it.",1
"When there to check it out and found the help is very poorly trained first and worst thing is getting your car from valet in back by the rooms the pick up area is so small in traffic areas my daughter almost got hit stupid idea and when you go to check in valet in front you have to walk all the way through the casino to check in there are only 3 food places and no Starbucks but a very bad coffee place that says they don't have a blender so no mixed drinks the rooms are so small in you fart you can stink up the intire room. Casino is so very small no good machines table games everywhere , I don't think I will go back it is no MGM better.",1
"I've been to TR several times and can't believe I've never given them a review. n nI always love a place where you can get an ice cold beer and munch on peanuts while you're waiting on your meal. Yeast rolls are also provided but I feel like eating bread before the meal tends to fill me up before the real food arrives. n nI've tried different meals here but the one that can't be beat is The Roadkill. It's basically a hamburger steak smothered with onions, mushrooms, and cheese. It might not seem fancy enough to you but this is one of the most tastiest pieces of meat I ever get at a restaurant. They season it perfectly. No need for steak sauce. n nI've tried the ribs they're good not great still can't find great in Charlotte , pulled pork I'd rather go to a real BBQ joint , steak not bad at all , and chicken fried steak not a fan . Sides are always good. Favorites are loaded mashed potatoes, steamed veggies, or the best the loaded Sweet Potato. The only ""bad "" thing about the sweet potato is that it is more of a dessert than a part of the meal. Topped with seared marshmallows, brown sugar cinnamon.oops.just drooled on my keyboard. You get the picture. n nWhere TR fails are their appetizers. Chicken fingers, potato skins, cheese fries are all just very mediocre. Their version of the bloomin' onion is better at their competition's cough OUTBACK cough . This particular location has ""Twisted "" fried mozzarrella sticks one of the few nationwide, supposedly and they are the best bet to get. They have a nice selection of mixed drinks but like all chain restaurants, they skimp on the alcohol and jack up the prices. n nService is always great at this location. Lots of cute gals serving and they get up and line dance at various times. There's always a manager making the rounds to ask everyone if everything is alright. That should be a standard at all of these type of restaurants. n nYour pal, nWalter",2
My review is based on the bar at Gallagher's. nFernando is the best bartender ever. He's also from my hometown. n nLast visit here was a couple weeks ago. I always ask him to surprise me with a drink. I am always pleased with what he creates! We also ate a few appetizers. The mac n' cheese is to die for! We also had bruschetta and a bowl of clam chowder! Mmm.,2
"One of best steaks I've had. Definitely a solid 4.5 even better, I dined on lobster bisque, a bone in ribeye steak w smashed potatoes, sauted mushrooms and creamed spinach. n nMy steak was was cooked to perfection, juicy throughout. not to mention the little things such as the pat of compound butter that added that punch. The lobster bisque was smooth and rich. The sides we're all great as well. n nThe pricing was fair, it is a la carte steakhouse after all thats what you come to expect at an establishment like this. Service was just right, very attentive but at the same time the wait staff wasnt breathing down our neck. Loved my experience here, hopefully we will back again soon!",2
"This is such a cute little place! The employees are extremely nice and they bring everything over to whatever table you are sitting at. The food is tasty and they switch the menu up daily. I cannot wait to start coming here more whenever the weather gets warmer, since I walk here from work on my lunch.",2
I love chicken wings but the wings they use here are a bit too small. The boneless chicken wings is the best way to go even though it looks like chicken nuggets. The variety of sauces are pretty good. This may be the only thing that redeems this place. Everything is ala carte which means expensive for bar food. For the price.not worth it for me . Just buy your favorite sauces and cook your own wings at home.,1
"Great place to hang out at the M Resort, excellent selection of beers in a nice setting. The Ommegang is worth the trip alone, be sure and order a sandwich from the deli while you are there. n nThey cannot offer you much in the way of recommendations, but their menu goes into excellent detail and they are very good about taking it back if you do not like the selection.",2
might be the best burger in town !,2
"The hotel has a bright and colorful theme going for it. At first glance, it seems great. However, there is debris in the pool and all over the chairs. I had to tip my chair over before laying on it because of all the plant particles. I do understand that there are a lot of trees around the pool and some of this is inevitable but it did appear that no one was attempting to keep up with this. n nI live in Phoenix, had a hectic work week and decided to play vacation at the resort. The two main reasons we chose this resort is that it has pool service and a spa. My game plan for the day was to lay by the pool, have someone bring me mojitos, and get a massage. n nI walked in the door and was charged a resort fee. I feel like renting a room at the resort should pay for me to use the resort. When I got to the pool, I discovered that there is no pool service on Monday. It was a Monday so I was out of luck. I did see a phone on the wall that says call for service. When I called to order a drink, the girl on the phone told me that there was pool service and that I should wait. So, I waited 10 more minutes and called her back to tell here that there is clearly no one working here. She insisted that someone would be with me shortly. So, I started walking to the restaurant to get a drink. The valet guys stopped me to inform me of the phone on the wall and that the girl on the phone should know that there is no pool service on Mondays. Eventually, someone brought me a drink and never came back. I was again charged a random extra fee for my drink. I was also charged a random extra fee for the bottle of water that I drank later on. I think this hotel is clearly not doing well so they are trying to nickel and dime you to death with all of their lame fees. n nThen, I tried to book my massage only to find out that again I was out of luck. The spa is closed on Mondays. n nI was completely unimpressed and will not be back.",1
"I chose this place because of the great reviews I read here on Yelp. Rarely I've been let down and this is the occassion where I was let down. I had high expectations and left disappointed. We ordered 5 dishes for take out and like my bf said see K.C. none of them were great. The only one that I seemed to like best is the salty peppery pork chops. Seriously, I could have gone to Panda Express and be very satisfied. The frozen potstickers you get at Costco taste better too. We ordered chow mein and the noodles were way too thick. Kung pao chicken wasn't even close to the kung pao chicken we've had at other chinese places. We had lots of leftovers but didn't bother to heat it up again. n nCall me picky because I'm from the Bay Area which has a lot of GREAT chinese food in Oakland and San Francisco. I wouldn't even dare to compare. n nI don't recommend this place at all.",1
"Celebrity is one of those small, but just large enough venues that every seat in the house is good, and all seats are reasonably priced, parking is not bad and is only 5. I can honestly say that when someone comes here I am willing to go see them. Celebrity is so much better then any of the the other larger venues that just treat their customers like cattle pack them in, and rush them out . n nThe only thing that I think they could do better on is the price of their non alcoholic drinks. They were even higher then Disneyland was for a bottle of soda. If they were better priced I would have bought more then one, but I hate being gouged. n nOverall I give you a thumbs up, but only gave 4 of 5 stars because of your over price waters soda's",2
"So the service was bad. I must admit I really liked what I ordered however my boyfriend was extremely displeased with the quality of his meal. First time we've been to this place, probably won't be back. From what I've read the only thing that sounds good is their bar.",1
"Very cool interior BUT the food's gotta go. n nIt's bad. Bad expensive a big NO NO. n nWe got the beef noodle bowl. Big mistake. The flavorless broth desperately needed some salt, or something. Chow mein noodles and tiny slivers of beef are the only other ingredients. Never again. n nBraised tofu and veggies was 14. I guess that's what you can expect to pay at a chinese joint inside the Caesars. The portion was really small and the sauce wasn't very good. Never again. n nThe only 'okay' dish was the cold beef appetizer. Basically it's a marinated shank that's been boiled, then chilled, then sliced thinly with some cilantros thrown on top. The portion was surprisingly generous and it tasted ok. n nOverall, this place is a disappointment. The noodle joint at the Bellagio is WAY better. 2 stars for the appetizer and the trippy decor.",1
"After a long day of devouring snacks I was in desperate need for a bubble tea. n nThis was the first local store that we came across and decided to go in. The restaurant was messy and cluttered with god knows what. The woman working there seemed to be the only one there are, however she was incredibly nice! n nWhen it came to the bubble tea I can't say that it was very good, or good at all. It was way too milky and artificially flavored for my taste. Also one of my favorite things in bubble tea is the bubbles, which the tea was severely lacking.",1
"Welcome to Downtown Summerlin. The Mall that hates your children. n nAs a parent then watching this mall get built was so exciting. This quadrant of Vegas definitely needed a shopping area and even in their family fun filled opening it looked like they were doing everything right. n nBut once those opening day balloons deflated then it became clear that they didn't build this mall with children in mind. n nParks There is NONE. During that opening weekend I didn't even notice since they had so many street vendors doing kids stuff. But on a regular day then there's absolutely nowhere to let your kids run around. yes, there's the water monolith near the theater but that clearly isn't meant for kids. n nStores the shoppes are mainly upscale which is to be expected. But where's the Children's Place? They have one of those ""don't touch the toys "" Toy Stores and a Build a Bear but that's it. Even the Apple Store is missing it's little ""Kids "" Table that is found in every Apple Store across the country. n nEvents To be fair they are trying. sometimes they have events but they haven't matched up to the opening weekend. They had a horribly cast 6ft Elsa and 4'7 "" Anna at the ice rink and they buried Santa in that unused tent. n n nI'm not slamming on the mall. We like it very much BUT it does definitely feel as if a more permanent kids area is missing and I hope they address it in that open field where the temporary skate rink was put up.",1
"First off Like one of the other posters on Yelp, I feel a little guilty giving only 2 stars as I too REALLY like the concept. However, the devil is in the details and the execution and I just thought this is where they fall short. n nFirst of all, liked the ingredients, but for some reason they just didn't work well together. n nI also thought that the 4 separate bowls we ordered were VERY light on sauce. So much so that it was often difficult to discern the flavor as it was outweighed by the blandness of the noodles and protein. Blandness that is EXCEPT for the crispy tofu. n nNOW if you look at the menu online it CLEARLY says crispy tofu. What it DOES NOT say is that it is VERY spicy. So, when ordering a children's bowl with crispy tofu, and asking for a non spicy sauce to accompany it that a kid would like one would think that the person on the other end would bring up the fact that the tofu is VERY spicy. So much so that it was hot for my palate and I like spice. Too much so for a seven year old who happily took her bite of two pieces of tofu chewed and swallowed before she realized just how hot it was. Between cries, coughs from the spice, and a glass of milk, lets just say I had to fix something else for my daughter. n nThe chicken was fine and so was my wife's shrimp. BUT Seriously, if you have a 'children's bowl' on the menu, AND Tofu is a choice, you probably ought to a Call it SPICY CRISPY TOFU b Recommend that if the children's bowl is for a child, you recommend something OTHER than the TOFU! n nI would have let it slide if this was the lunch rush, but the place was empty and it seemed to be that the owner manager was actually running the show. I mean seriously, not sure what they were thinking. Or maybe they just weren't?",1
"After being advised by my son to NOT eat at Mickey's, I thought, ""well, how bad could it be for breakfast? "" The answer very bad. This is a sleazy, greasy, dirty dinner frequented by people who are looking for only quantity because there is no quality. The place, on a Thursday morning, was packed. n nI ordered a cheese and bacon sandwich on toast. The bacon had an ""off "" flavor. I don't know if it was rancid, but the bacon was awful. I was done after one bite. n nMy sister ordered French Toast which means ""bread dipped in an egg milk wash and fried on a griddle. When it came, it looked like well done scrambled eggs no discernible pieces of bread found. The ""mass "" covered the entire plate. She said there was something wrong with the French toast it had cinnamon and the bread was lumpy. Then she tasted the raisin. The waitress said this was ""Mickey's take on French toast. "" She should have said, ""This was yesterday's cinnamon raisin roll that was recycled for the poor souls who want french toast. "" After noting my sister was not happy with the cinnamon raisin egg much, she brought some regular toast as requested. n nIf you like a quality breakfast in a clean restaurant, this is NOT the place for you. A Waffle House is much, much better. I should have listened to my son. Never again will I pass though this dump.",1

"first off their counter customer service is not good. I stood there looking at the people behind the counter for quite a few minutes before someone finally asked me if I needed help.

If I wanted shortening on my cupcake, I could of done that at home. n nThe chocolate eclair was terrible too. The custard had no flavor at all and they used sugary chocolate buttercream frosting on top where as you usually use a different type of chocolate frosting. The brownie was ok but Vons makes a better one at half the price. n nI don't mind paying high prices on good bakery items but this place is not good. I can make better items at home.

"Pricey repairs for air conditioning. Being the good Union wife that I am, when my mothers a c went out, I opted for a union company to do the repair. It was a Friday afternoon, about 2 30, and was told that there would be after hours charge for coming out to repair unit. Not thrilled, but ok. Todd was very friendly and did a good job fixing the problem, but the price of the bill was incredible. We were charged 196 to look up the part number and to pick it up. I found a coupon to use for 75 off, and still paid 520 for the repair. When I went home that evening, I found that the a c at my house had failed as well. When it rains, it pours. Turned out to be the same part that my Mom had to have replaced on her unit. My husband was able to fix our unit for 18. Too bad he was at work on Friday, and not available to look at the a c at Mom's. After talking to several people within the company, we are being refunded the after hours charge of 99. Unless you're eager to throw away good money on repairs, I'd look into a different company.",1

"Roy's Aloha Hour was the newest addition this summer to this Asian Fusion restaurant hailing from Hawai'i. On Mondays through Fridays, from 4 30 pm to 7 pm, 5 menu items for drinks and food are available. n nOf course, when we arrived the past Friday we didn't know about this special hour. So our dinner reservations celebrating Restaurant Week turned into a happy hour feast. n nTaking a seat outside to enjoy the warm late summer evening, we looked over the drink menus. With quite a selection, we began with n n 1988 ""A tribute to our opening year in Honolulu. Perfectly balanced blend of tart grapefruit and tangy pomegranate with ABSOLUT Ruby Red Vodka, SOHO Lychee Liqueur and Patron Citronge Liqueur echoes the idyllic island lifestyle. "" HH 5 Delicious. This was the Husband's drink choice and I didn't give it a second thought because it had grapefruit in it. However, I caught a whiff of the lychee and couldn't resist taking a sip. It was good, without the bitterness of grapefruit. For my second drink and his, we both ordered one of these. n n Mango Mojito ""Fresh mango puree blended with Bacardi Limon Rum, hand squeezed lime juice and freshly muddled mint. "" HH 5 n Kalua Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich ""Garlic Parmesan Fries "" HH 5 This was my first drink choice and it was decent. It wasn't as great as the 1988 though. n nFood bites n n Chicken Shitake Mushroom Lettuce Wraps ""Chili Hoisin Dipping Sauce "" HH 5 A generous portion of bibb lettuce leaves and stuffing sat in a three sectioned platter along with the dipping sauce. It probably could have been presented a bit better. The lettuce wraps were okay, a bit too sweet though. The Husband found it to be rather mushy, and I would have to be agree. Not the highlight from this menu. n n Crispy Mochiko Chicken Bites ""Madras Curry Aioli "" HH 5 Served in a bamboo steamer, a generous portion of chicken and dipping sauce arrived. I was pleasantly surprised by the tasty chicken and the sauce complemented it nicely. n n Spicy Tuna Roll ""Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Kaiware "" HH 5 A simple roll cut into 8 pieces, but very good. They do their sushi rice well here. We ordered another one. n n Japanese Shishito Peppers ""Sweet Su Miso Sauce "" HH 5 A surprise and delightful find. We've had this elsewhere, but it was so much better here. So good we ordered another. I didn't use the dipping sauce, rather I dipped it back in the sauce it came in. n n Kalua Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich ""Garlic Parmesan Fries "" HH 5 Sliced into two triangles, the sandwich looked exciting from across the table. Then I noticed the bread, it's a lot thicker and softer, and I prefer it crispier as well. The shredded cheese wasn't melted all the way, which I think contributed to the lack of gooeyness one expects from a grilled cheese sandwich. I didn't even notice the pork in the sandwich as a result. The fries were good though. n nService was okay, not as stellar as I have expected from the Roy's chain though. n n3.5 stars.",2
"I have been thoroughly under impressed with Market Street Diner. We've had dinner there twice, and both times we left disappointed and unfulfilled. The first visit, I had the chicken chili which tasted like soup from a can, and my husband had a burger which was mediocre at best. We thought we'd try it one more time, and that will definitely be our last time for anything other than breakfast. I ordered the garden veggie wrap. When it came out, the wrap had one chunk of raw squash in it surrounded by lettuce. Where is the ""garden "" in this picture?! I mentioned it to the server, and she brought another which was just slightly better. The wrap had a few chunks of raw zucchini and squash with lettuce. Not much flavor at all, and I was expecting more of a veggie variety. My husband had the crispy chicken sandwich and was underwhelmed. We'll never go back for anything other than breakfast. Too bad it's not more like Monty's on Atwood in Madison.",1

"We enjoyed Lillie's Teppanyaki or as they call it ""Hibachi Grill "" on our last night in Las Vegas. It was a wonderful way to say farewell to a wonderful 9 day stay! n nThe service here is very good and the chefs are talented and have a great sense of humor! If you've never tried teppanyaki, I recommend it highly and this place gets it right! My husband and I have been to Benihana and other local teppanyaki restaurants but this was hands down the best either of us have had.so far. n nThe meal price includes soup, salad, grilled vegetables and steamed rice. Fried rice can be substituted for a nominal fee. I highly recommend the Emperor's Feast which allows you to enjoy three entr u00e9e items for 44. I enjoyed chicken, shrimp and tenderloin. All of it was excellently prepared with their amazing sauces and spices! They also provided three distinct dipping sauces mustard sauce for beef chicken, ginger sauce for seafood vegetables and a hot chili sauce for anything. I don't do hot sauces but my husband raved about the hot chili sauce! The other sauces were delicious! n nThe restaurant is small so be sure to make a reservation. You won't regret it!",2
"My wife and I have been members of the Gold's Gym in Gilbert, AZ Gym number 0175 for going on a year. I have to say that the gym has degraded quite a bit since we have joined. The gym seems to have over enrolled to the point that there are not enough parking spaces during peak hours causing people to ""create "" parking spots. The cardio equipment is dilapidated at best, when we first joined there were six elliptical trainers since then two were removed due to malfunction and the four that are left are barely running and a couple are not level. I am currently in contact with Gold's Corporate to see if there is any way that I can cancel the rest of my contract so that I can join a gym with adequate and functional equipment.",1
"My mouth waters just thinking of this place! The BF and I went to Vegas last weekend, and opted for a dinner at Ruth's Chris. We'd been to this location about a year ago, and after the horrific service we received at their Paradise Rd location this past February, we opted to come back here. n nIt is located in an unassuming strip mall a good distance from the strip, but if that keeps my wait time down to nothing for a table, hey I don't mind the 11 cab ride out there. The service here is just wonderful! Our waitress was friendly and helped us pick out a bottle of wine. And our food came out just at the right pace. Both of our steaks were cooked just as requested and were mighty tasty! n nSadly though, it appears as though this location is closing down They had a sign in their lobby directing patrons to frequent the Paradise Rd location in the future. And I guess that means the end of Ruth's Chris dinners in Vegas for me, since I refuse to return to the other location. http www.yelp.com biz ruths chris steak house las vegas 2 hrid YfjHw0PU2ZRJiE4yItk5EQ",2

Yes it's their job but after all that, I would not come back. Lacks the Spa environment.",1
"Check in was a bit of a mess. I had our paperwork confirming that we had 3 night stay there but they had us for only 1 night paid. Luckily the people who set up our stay were with us after 30 minutes the mess was straightened out and we got early check in without paying the fee. n nThe room was a nice corner penthouse room. I will say walking to the rooms down the hall there is a lot of maintenance that needs to be done! Wallpaper peeling, crown molding falling apart, carpet in need of replacing I'm sure when this hotel was new it looked far better than it does today. The hotel just looks beat up. The bed was HARD! I don't think we slept much because of the bed. Even being our room was non smoking you could still smell the smoke. n nThe little Crepe place was fantastic. We also enjoyed Jersey Boys, it was a fantastic show.",1
"I hope this place gets better with age. It serves food 24 hours, which I need after late nights at work. However, the service is AWFUL. The hostesses are cranky. The wait staff seems like this is their first time and, yes, I've been more than a few times . The food comes out in weird orders like my co workers ice cream sundae coming out before the appetizers. We waited a good 10 minutes for water and when she finally brought water, she brought a try of full glasses, slowly placing a full glass down and then picking up the empty, never been filled glass off the table. This took entirely too long. Where was the water pitcher? nI had a cheese pizza. Hard to go wrong there. It wasn't great but it was late night food and it did it's job. We also ordered a caesar salad which was so over dressed I couldn't eat it. My husband liked his jolly rancher cocktail. I hear all the candy type cocktails are great but I wasn't in the mood. n nOh, Kim Kardashian was seated just as we were leaving if you care about that sort of thing.",1
"3.75 Stars Tried this place twice now. Good. Food is delivered fast hot. The Mongolian Beef, Orange Lemon Chicken are about the best I've had in LV, but not in CA. Roomie had some sort of fish dish, she said it was OK. The egg rolls suck. A tad more then most local places. Oh, and their spicy here isn't very spicy. Order taker asks plenty of ?'s over the phone spiciness, style of rice special requests didn't seem to trip them up.",2

"Great spot for breakfast or lunch in downtown Mesa. The food is above average, and the pricing very reasonable. I eat here about once a week close to work . I would pick a local place like this over Denny's, Coco's and the like any day. They offer unique off menu specials like grandma's meatloaf, spinach quiche, and blueberry pancakes almost every day. n nNo waiting, the place is somewhat large and never too crowded. Has the look and feel of a mid western breakfast spot. n nThe staff are very polite and helpful, and they get to know you by name.",2
Don't listen to the negative reviews. This hotel was an amazing experience. So clean and modern. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. Bed was really comfortable and the bathroom and shower were very clean and modern. I want my apartment to look like this! Really cool rooms!

"Did anyone else get charged more then they signed for? Or was that just me? I am not happy at all for this. I am trying to get a hold of the bar but have no number. I was just there this past weekend used my card to pay signed for 35.00 no tip because I gave cash for the tip and yes I made sure I wrote that when I signed , today checking my bank statement I was charged 42 dollars, I know 7 dollars is not a lot of money but it's the principal of the matter that counts it doesn't matter if it was 25 u00a2 they still shouldn't do that. I'm going to look into them now to see if they've done this before if so legal action will be taken this is called robbery and I for one will not stand for it.

"I met a friend for dinner here a few nights ago some all you can eat and some Hockey on the provided TVs by the bar. n nThe restaurant is nicely laid out. The service is professional and well planned. And the prices, with AYCE, are very decent. The atmosphere was lively for a weeknight. n nThe popcorn lobster roll might just be the most beautiful thing I've found in a sushi bar in a very long time. It will have me coming back for more of its delicious fried beautifulness. I think this is something that this bar can call its own that it has actually created something I'd never tasted before at a sushi bar. And I think that says a fair amount. n nAlso, the fish was fresh and that is very, very important when you're looking to consume raw. Good location and its definitely worth the walk in if you're in the mood for sushi.",2
"Their dishes are amazing. Really wanted to try the other side, Joel Robuchon, but they were booked for the entire day. Therefore, I resolved into going to L'Atelier Joel Robuchon. Definitely will try Joel Robuchon next time I come back to vegas. I made a reservation on Thursday at 5 45pm through OpenTable and it was a 1000 point reservation which is a plus. 1000 point reservations are only available at that time though. n nTheir portions are very small so it is good to get the tasting menu or the pre fix meals. If i had more time, I would go with the tasting menu. However, this time I got their pre fix meal A. n nPre Fix Meal A comes with 1 amuse bouche, 2 2 appetizers, 3 1 entree, 4 dessert. around 75 80 n nPre Fix Meal B comes with 1 amuse bouche, 2 2 appetizers, 3 2 entrees, 4 dessert. about 105 n nPre Theatre Pre Fix comes with 1 amuse bouche, 2 1 appetizer, 3 meat of the day. 45 n nThe amuse bouche is a small appetizer. When we went, it was a foie gras dish in a small little cup. It had milk and some various ingredients. I couldn't really tell what it was but it was delicious. For the appetizer, entree, and dessert, you get to choose from a list of items. The appetizers have cold or hot options. I got the snapper carpaccio under the cold items and some foie gras soup from the hot items. The carpaccio was amazing and the foie gras soup was pretty unique. Never had foie gras like that but the flavor was very tasty. For my entree, I ordered the cod. It is a great dish but it is very small. Thank goodness they give everyone a side of mashed potatoes for these pre fix meals or else I wouldn't have been full. In my opinion, each dish was served with too much time in between. There was a lot of waiting. I know these meals are supposed to be like this but this restaurant took a little longer than usual. Lastly, I got the caiperhinia dessert. There is a lot of alcohol taste to this. Our table also had the gelato dessert that was included in another person's pre fix menu. The gelato comes with 3 flavors if I remember correctly. The green was was really good in my opinion. It had a hint of basil flavor. We also ordered a souffle that wasn't part of the pre fix menus. The souffle also had ALOT of alcohol taste to it. It was unique though. My friend got the 45 Pre Theatre and that day, the meat of the day was a new york steak. The meat was SO delicious, it melted in your mouth. In addition to these pre fix items, we ordered the foie gras stuffed quail because I saw on their website that it was one of their most popular items. There is an appetizer portion and an entree portion. We got the entree portion to share and it was about 45. Super small portions. definitely not an entree portion. but it was good though. n nThe amount of food was just perfect. I wasn't too full or leaving hungry. I would definitely try the 16 course meal and try to get reservations at the regular joel robuchon next time though. The service here was a bit slow. I had to ask a couple times to have my water refilled and I had my plates taken when I wasn't finished eating yet.",2
"I went there on a Sunday to watch football. My buddy is a Cowboy fan and I was told this was a cool spot. Walked in and it was dead quite. Not like any sports bar. We ordered two bloody Mary's. Once we got them we each took a sip and hated them. When the waitress came back we asked if we could return them and exchange them for some beers instead. She grabbed my Bloody Mary and took a sip out of it, looked at me and said ""it taste fine to me ""'. She walked away and came back and said we could not return the Bloody Mary's and had to pay for them. Even after she took a sip out of it! Wow! On top of that we were forced to buy an additional item because there is a 10 minimum for credit card purchases! Insane! We paid and walked out. Never again. I guess they do just cater to a certain kind of clientele and it seems that's all they want. Looking back we would have just walked out but she had my buddy's card so it felt like we were forced to pay. What place makes you pay for something you don't like? Especially since we both only took a small sip and the waitress took a sip out if my drink to taste it! Wow! This place is really a dump. That might explain why there was a total of 10 ppl in there. Maybe bike night is the only thing keeping them afloat. Who knows.",1

"Not sure what to expect, but really pleasantly surprised. Locally sourced food prepared extremely well. Great space nice view of the wine cellar or a clever prop.

Good wine list, though. The markup is the only blemish on an otherwise excellent dining experience.",2
"This is one of the 2 closest 24 hr fitness gyms near my house. It also has my favorite 24x class instructor.

She also teaches Step Class and Body pump on Thursday 9 and 10 respectively. I love the way she teaches and makes it easy to follow along. I wish they hadnt done away with 24 lift b c I miss it. They phased it out and replaced it with BodyPump and I feel like I got more out of 24 lift for some reason. n nah well. I'm addicted to this bodypump now. This gym has the standard fare ellipticals, steppers, treadmills, bikes, etc. No AMT machines this location either. Strangely this gym doenst have a scale in the public area but only behind the desk area where the trainers are and I feel thats so that you'll step in that area nd they will try to get you to sign up for a personal trainer.

"We were seated quickly on a Saturday night. The first thing we overheard from the table next to us was the couple complaining about the lousy food they were served to the manager. It was awkward and uncomfortable. We ordered the prix fixe menu. Our food was very flavorful, but the portions were rather small and the service was very slow. We also heard the table behind us also complain about their order being messed up and the kitchen taking way to long to fix it. We weren't offered bread, but maybe that didn't come from with the prix fixe? No explanation there. n nAnyway, I wouldn't go back. It had a very negative vibe that night and even though our food was tasty, it was too expensive and too long of a meal to be enjoyable, plus I left hungry.",1

Great food. Always prompt. Service is good. The cheap margaritas are decent for 1.75. I've had tamales on 3 different occasions here and I cant say I have enjoyed any of them. There always ends up being a dry and hard on one end. Not sure what the issue is was. the last time I had one there they covered it a green chile sauce. I think to rehydrate maybe. But everything else I've had has been excellent. The gyro meat platter thing is a little odd though.,2
"When it comes to a haircut, you can either go to a cheap place like Great Clips, or you can spend more money to get a great haircut with a stylist that takes their time.

Note I stopped short by calling them hair stylists, much the same way I stop short in calling Great Clips employees stylists. For the higher price, I got a quick buzz cut with someone who didn't check to make sure the cut was even. I was in and out of that chair in 5 minutes. For the price, that isn't something I expect. n nIf you want to pay more for a similar hair cut to the cheap franchises, THIS is the place to go. You will love it here. For me . someone who expects a GREAT haircut for a higher price, I'm going someplace else. If I want this type of hair cut, I'm saving money and going to Great Clips. n nFor the owner, you need to get rid of the young brunette girl at night. She is terrible as a hair cutter not stylist , and makes your business look bad.",1
"If I lived in Scottsdale I'd probably be broke in a short amount of time because I'd be spending all my money buying cocktails at Citizen Public House.

"Solid 4 stars. Maybe in 5. n nA neat place to come have a drink. I believe every other Thursday or Saturday there is PRISM night hosted by one good looking gentleman. n nThe drinks are reasonable, the atmosphere very quaint, very unvegas'sy, chill, relaxing place. n nThe servers are good, but check out Prism night as it pulls an eclectic group of people. n n Hint No food is served.

"While trekking to the neighborhood Apple store, we thought we might give this place a try. Being that it was happy hour, DH and DS and I took a hi top table in the bar and settled down looking for some good food we could smell those burgers everywhere in San Tan Village! . n nDH ordered the Asian Fusion combination platter which had Southwestern Egg Rolls, Chinese Potsticker, and Tempura Shrimp. At 11, it was a little pricey but it was a decent portion for a dinner and would have been a shareable appetizer for 2 or 3. Presentation was nice and the sauces were tasty. n nDS ordered the BBQ burger which was a nice sized burger. Interestingly they didn't ask how he wanted it done which meant in my world, I was having nothing to do with it. I can't stand a well or medium well burger and that is exactly what they served up. And it came with a pile of garlic fries. The verdict is still out on those. DS, who lives for anything garlic, even remarked that they were just a little to heavy handed with the garlic seasoning on them. n nOh and one other thing that just slayed me yellow mustard! In this day and age of 11 burgers, please chef, freaking offer something other than yellow mustard! It is like setting a table with the best china and linens and then giving someone a plastic fork there is a time and place for yellow mustard, but not on anything other than fast food. n nDS and I both had the Lobster Bisque. At 4.50 a cup, I had high expectations. Wow. Such a disappointment. It arrived with a swirl of sour cream on top so I had high hopes at the start but.there was nothing in it. Not a speck of lobster. Yes, it was rich, Yes, it was creamy. But NOTHING in it. It was lobster flavored bisque. Oh, wait, yes, there were some lumps in it not sure if it was some roux that had not been whisked in doubtful or more likely the pot scum that you get with cream sauces. So this is off my recommended list if you are going to have bisque, put something in it besides soup base and white sauce heck, I can get that from a can of Campbells. n nI ordered the Turkey combo 1 2 turkey sandwich, and a soup or salad opting for the house salad. Interestingly enough, DH ordered a house salad on the side his came with spiced pecans and way more cheese so realize this is not a full house salad included in the combo. The turkey 1 2 sandwich came with watercress mayo which was heavily laden with garlic it tasted oddly like one of the sauces DH got with his platter I think it was just the overwhelming garlic flavor that made everything taste alike .The sandwich was a decent portion and was not a bad deal with the salad for the price but I ended up eating it without 1 2 of the toast since that mayo was just well, for lack of a better term gross. It was too overwhelming of a flavor with the mild turkey. I'd recommend asking for it on the side and deciding yourself. n nService well, that left a lot to be desired. It was happy hour and the place was dead except for the bar. Asking for dressing on the side of the salad was ignored. Could not get extra napkins or much attention at all. n nAll in all it was okay. Nothing I would go out of my way for. Our bill for three, including tip, was 64. That included one beer, one soda, and the above food. I thought a little overpriced. So next Apple visit, we will venture and try somewhere else.",1
"I really hope Native Newyorkers CORPORATE is paying attention to these reviews. Most people here are complaining about the same things over and over and with my recent visit I can assure you none of those problems have been fixed. n nHere's my experience from my recent visit on the Mayweather's fight past week. n n When we walked in, after telling the host how many, he just handed the menu to us and told us to sit wherever instead of walking us to a table. This is the worst you can do to a customer. Hand them a menu and tell them to go sit down. Are you too lazy to walk them to a table? n n Place was disgusting. Beer all over the floor and sticky seats and tables. n n Like most people complained here, this facility seems like a depressing hotel from the 90's. No ambience, not hip at all. Also has a weird smell. n n WINGS EXTRA SMALL compare to any other NN location. n n Rude waiters, specially the guys that work here. No smile, Not friendly. n n Our chicken strips came out burnt. Returned the order. No manager came out to talk to us. n nAll in all this NN has worst service than a moms and pops Pete's fish. Not worth it.",1
"I ate here once for Valentine's Day dinner. The image I gleaned from their website made it appear to be all plush pillows, flickering candles, and meditating statuettes. nThe internet can be so deceiving. nFirst of all, the chic dining area they prominently display on their website, which is and I quote , ""designed as a hipster hangout and features plush seating beneath the striking murals of international artist Farhad Elahi "" is their reserved banquet dining room, tucked far away in the backend of the restaurant. Regular parties eat in a much less interesting and unromantic dining space, complete with standard tables and chairs. I suppose the general vim of this spot is acceptable for lunch or a casual dinner, but it was V Day and I wanted to sit on a sexy red pillow damnit! Exacerbating the ambiance situation was the food situation. Being adventurous not to mention gluttonous we pretty much ordered one of everything. The mulagatani soup was an unremarkably flavorless bowl of pepper and water, while the other Pakistani style dishes were just as boring and lacking in flavor and heat. The service sucked, especially considering it was V Day. This place is in sync with the line of reasoning adopted by its sister restaurants around the valley Gandhi's and Gaylord's , in that hiking up your prices and offering a wine list somehow makes you less of a mediocre North Indian Pakistani spot and more of a, and I quote, ""hipster hangout. "" Next please.",1
Very bad experience today! I ad the worst excuse for a Veggie burger I've ever experienced! The same rendition at Denny's is 100 better! I was told it was made in house and received a charred version of a Boca burger with zero flavor! nThank goodness for sweet potato fries! Ill pass on Maizies next time,1

"I am sorry to say, but I went here hoping for REAL english tea house, it truely is not. n nInside is nice, decor, and the cups and plates are kind of fancy, got me really excited. nWaitress was really nice, but she kind of roughly places the tea and dishes which realllly take away from experience. n nFood. I had one of the crepe course, my mother had the most expensive one, my chicken crepe was pretty good, but rest was. n nlets just say, it was my fault for expecting a real tea house in AZ. n ntheir pastires tasted and looked like samples from fry's groceory stores, nthey try with their sandwich and stuff, but really it looked so crappy and tasted like regular teenage made sandwich, nothing as fancy as their menu make it sound. n nFor the price they charge, i think they have to try little bit harder. but i think they do good with older customers who lived in az all their life, but can't fool ppl that actually traveled across the country ",1
"The food here was all just okay. Nothing tasted horrible but they didn't taste good either. I went on Thursday so maybe the good chef works on Friday or Saturday when they have their Gourmet dinners. n nI would say the best item here was either the prime rib for a buffet place, it's good or else the cocktail shrimp. The sauce was perfect and not a skimpy shrimp and it was decorated very well. My favorite thing here was the desserts. The Whooping Pie was like a mousse filling with a soft chocolate cake around it. n nThe thing that saved our evening here, was our waiter was just AWESOME.",1
Pizza is the best. Always get a slice of Mac and cheese! Staff is friendly but don't be surprised to see a slew of drunk college kids. It's the too go pizza place to grab a slice if you're having a late night or just really really hungry.,2
"We were here there this weekend celebrating 2 birthdays. We had bottle service for 350 our ""waitress "" sucked and didn't deserve for mandatory gratuity but that is the only complaint I have. Well that an 8 water but that is to be expected in Vegas. We had an amazing time, I enjoyed all the music and danced all night. I would definitely go back! If you want to dance and have fun, I say check this place out. I'm not sure what the cover was so I can't comment on that. There was a good mix of dance r b hip hop and pop music. If you like that kind music you will probably enjoy this place even if you don't you just might have a good time, my boyfriend did!",2
Went here with some coworkers for lunch. Was not impressed with the pizza at all. The garlic bread tasted store bought. Will not return.,1

SO DELICIOUS! I can't wait to go tomorrow for their lunch special! It's like 5 dish and my favoriteeeees are black pepper shredded beef and xo green beans . oh my they are SO yummmy . i'm getting hungry just thinking about it! I think this is the best place for authentic chinese dishes in Vegas!,2
"The food is okay but it's really overpriced, and you can't tell how much you'll end up spending because they weight your food at the end. I find it to not be filling at all , one hour after eating I was already hungry again. The only thing that I really love about commensal is their thai tofu but you can get it at the grocery store they have their own line of microwaveable food . Overall it's just not worth it, there are better vegetarian choices in montreal.",1
"I saw the reviews on yelp, and decided to try. One of the best veggie burgers and chocolate pan cakes on this planet. If you are in Vegas, definitely worth a stop. Plenty options for vegetarian and kid friendly. Good customer service. I can't wait to be back.",2
"This place was just okay for me. As a vegan, there were hardly any options for me and what I did get definitely left something to be desired. I also spent way more money than I expected to 2.50 to add a tiny glob of guac? Really? . n nI did love the salsas, though, and the hot sauce is very tasty. I would go back and just munch on the chips and dips that they bring you, but I wouldn't order anything off the menu. I've had better Mexican food for cheaper.",1

"What are you doing Sahara?! Now the Caravan Cafe is open from 7am to 11pm only? I used to go at 3am on a Tuesday morning and now you have limited hours?! I am surprised, but now I am quite concerned about the future of Sahara. n nAfter a failed attempt at going to The Orleans for a very cheap great quality buffet, the next choice was the Caravan Cafe where my meals are free. The previous night, I was shocked to know about the relocation and reorganization of the Caravan Cafe and very disappointed. Paco's Bar Grill was the previous location before Caravan moved in. n nWell, lets get straight to the food and move away from the negatives. I am not sure about the prices since I have a lot of comps and didn't worry about the prices. I did order the Corn Beef Hash Eggs Sunny Side Up with Wheat bread for 8.25 I believe with the Sahara Club Card and I think it was 9.75 without. The Corn Beef Hash was below average to average. I swear they were conserving too much cause I ate it fast before I finished it. The eggs were OK, nothing spectacular. n nThe setting was too small. The other customers were literally just an arms length apart. I didn't feel comfortable in there now. So much has changed in here and I am not sure I am going to like what Sahara will do. Hopefully, they can move it back and make it 24 hours all week. n nHope You Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!",1

"Why am I reviewing a Walmart? It's simple. No one reads reviews for Walmart. So this 1 star effort won't make an inkling of difference.

"I was disappointed in my yelper pals. No way this place deserves a 4 average. Onion soup was mediocre, salad had just mixed greens and onions. My ""shrimp "" and scallops in cream au gratin was not good at all the shrimp were just bigger than brine shrimp all overcooked and cheese dry and cold on top.

"Great hotel with very cool and well appointed rooms. If you're looking for a great, full service hotel, this might not be the place because there isn't much else to it besides the hotel no casino, no restaurants, etc. Most of the shopping and gambling needs are met by the mall that connects to Planet Hollywood Casino, which is about a 10 minute walk.or a 20 minute walk from the Elara, depending on your condition state of mind. n nWe stayed in the ""extra wide "" 2BR 2BA suite these are only available from floors 51 56.I think and also had the 2 other rooms that connected to the suite for a total of 4BRs and 4BAs, which is impressive. The views are amazing, especially at night with all the other buildings lit up. The suite had a full kitchen, Washer Dryer, dining room, projection screen tv, the main BR suite has 300 degree views, a hot tub, and a tv in the bathroom. A total Vegas suite.it was awesome. n nThe only negative of the suite besides being so far from a casino was that the glass is tinted pink, so during the day the suite looked as if we had just landed on Mars. n nOverall we had a great time and, for the price, probably could not have gotten a better suite hotel room. I'll be staying there again for sure.",2
"I went here for a bachelor party last Friday and have to say, it's one of the worst clubs I have ever been to. The reason you spend thousands of dollars for a stupid booth and unnecessarily expensive bottle service upstairs '03 Opus One was 500 is so you can pour drinks for the chicks. Not at this place there is a rope separating the tables from the rest of the riff raff, which I'm sure is necessary but totally negates the random chicks walking by asking them to pour your a drink. n nThe place is jam packed, they let in WAY TOO MANY ""Joey's "" and the chicks are mostly pretty busted. I'm engaged so I like to go to these dumps for some eye candy. Not really the place for that. For the hassle it was waiting for the place to open, to the zoo it was inside we never hungout downstairs but should have , this place blew. I will never go back.",1
"Great Staff! Large Store, many booths Open Sunday evenings I went yesterday about 5 00. Closed Monday and Tuesdays I've been those days too ! You never know what you will find in a place like this!",2
Eeewww! Skip this place! The food is gross no seasoning on anything! I got a pasta dish so bland and pointless to eat. My boyfriend got a burger that was way overcooked and the bun was too large to even eat with the meat! Garlic bread was way spicy why I don't know. Wouldn't expect that to have a kick but my mouth was on fire . I got house wine to drink which seemed like it had been uncorked for a month so the next glass I upgraded which was a bad idea because I could only take a sip of because it was so gross. Never again!,1

"Rarely do I write reviews, good or bad, but this place deserves to be properly elevated not only for an amazing food menu, but for a fabulous drink menu, a cozy, comfortable, unassuming atomosphere, and thoughtful, considerate and amusing wait staff. n nOur table had the braised short rib, salmon, burger, mac n cheese, potatoes au gratin, and kale salad, all of which were seasoned to perfection not very salty, which I prefer and sufficiently sized portions. We also tried a couple of their desserts, which were pretty good, but I'm not big on dessert.I'm big on the main course, which was delicious! n nMaybe I got lucky, maybe not, but I will definitely be going back to Roosters next time I'm in Charlotte.",2
"This review boarders on the 3 4 star range, so I'll just go with four. nThe pizza was alright. The crust was good, but like other yelpers have said, a little too soggy in the middle. I also wasn't digging the ricotta cheese they used on the pizza. Perhaps it was more authentic than I'm used to, or perhaps it was just gross. I'm not sure. nFive stars for the tiramisu. Holy cannoli it was delicious! the best I've ever had. nThe layout of the restaurant was nice, and I enjoyed the Italian music playing in the background. nIt's a small restaurant, so make sure you call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait. nI will most likely return, but only for that amazing tiramisu and some wine!",2
"Okay, let me preface by saying I would love to give them 2.5 stars nice, I know , and that it wasn't awful, it just wasn't as mind blowing as I expected it to be. n nFirst of all, I really enjoyed the layout of the restaurant, and I am SO excited that they have an open, large patio combined bar. I love that Phoenix restauranteurs are finally catching on that we appreciate a good patio situation. So, props for that. n nThe inside of the restaurant was.different. I wasn't a fan of the cow mural falsely giving the illusion of say, grass fed beef? , and the bathroom paparazzi were a bit frightening. n nI started with a Lemon Sipper ? , with Absolute Citron, mint and lemonade for 8. Either they seriously know how to mix a drink, or they forgot the liquor altogether. I couldn't tell from the taste, but judging by my buzz or rather lack thereof I would say they either forgot or skimped. Bigtime. n nAnyway, we ordered the zucchini fries 6 with a side of the truffle aioli to start. We ended up receiving the zucchini fries AND an order of truffle fries, but it was busy and we didn't feel like making a scene so we kept them albeit for an extra 5 . The truffle fries were good, nothing to write home about. I would have appreciated the zucchini fries baked rather than deep fried in so much batter. Both fries were covered in grated parmesan cheese.almost to the point of overwhelming. Positive? The truffle aioli was very good. n nI ordered the ""Zinburger "" 10 medium well lately my medium burgers have been on the rarer side, so I order with caution with added jalapenos for 1. The burger was cooked more medium which I suppose it what I was going for , and the jalapenos came on the side, which I thought odd. Also, I'm almost 100 positive they came from a jar, purchased at my local Safeway. For a buck? Bummer. The burger itself was just OK. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, it would be nice to have a wider, thinner patty.and not be soaked in grease. The bottom of my bun was soaked and soggy before it even hit the table. n nWe ordered the chocolate cream pie 6 for dessert and it was very good. n nService was up to par, maybe a little too much, but I'm sure that's only because it was opening week, everyone's new, bosses are there, yada yada. n nTotal tab per person was 30, excluding tip. Do I think it was worth paying that much for an average burger meal? Not so much. Also, why can't a restaurant that carries a limited and expensive menu specializing in burgers Zin, Delux serve higher quality beef? As in, grass fed.organic.both? n nIf I ever come back it will be to sit at the bar and enjoy a glass or two of wine.and maybe a shake, cause I hear they're pretty good.",1
"I tried to like this place. really, I did. They moved down to Flamingo and Pecos, in a dreary little plaza. The same one that Metro killed a guy in last year. n nThe service is friendly, so that gives them a star. Well, the brisket is OK as well, but it's not worth a second one. n nWhere did they go wrong? Well, the sides all seemed like they came out of a tin or container, rather than being made fresh. The beans tasted bad, the macaroni salad tasted like it came from Albertson's, and unfortunately, I've had better yams from a can. n nThe rib tips were tough as leather, the pork lacked any real taste, and the sausage link kind of tasted like something from Hormel. n nThey rushed to open in the new location, so when we went, they only had canned drinks available. n nThe brisket was quite good, but, I just can't think of a reason to go back to this place. It's a real shame, because the place came very highly recommended.",1
"I lift the weights and I put them down! This review is only for the actual free weights gym area as I did not use any of the spa services. n nOne of the better casino health clubs I have trained at. The Spa at Bally's gym is loaded with free weights, machines, benches, cardio, and dumbbells. It has one of the best selections of Icarian machines I have seen in a casino gym, along with real steel free weight plates, cable racks, bars, smith machine, and a great selection of metal dumbbells up to 100 pounds. I hate those rubberized weights. There is a nice cardio area off to the side with Cybex treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals. A few flat screens hang from the ceiling. n nThe facility itself is very clean and well maintained. Even though the equipment might not be the newest it looks pretty current, and nothing was broken or out of service. The locker room is pretty sweet. Really nice facilities with hot tubs, saunas, couches, flat screen tv, coffee, and fruit. Early in the morning there are not that many people up at that time so I basically had the gym to myself. n nThe hours of the gym are 6am 6pm, so it's good for an early morning workout but I wished it stayed open later for those of us who are working a long show at the convention center and would like to get in a workout when returning back to the hotel. Also, you can buy a daily pass or a three day pass for 51 which includes unlimited access and use of the spa. If staying more than a few days it's worth it to get a multiple day pass to bring the rate down. As with all casino health clubs it's not cheap, but worth it for the quality of the equipment here, and if you value staying on top of your fitness while away from home. n nIt's not like going to your normal fully stocked gym where you have your membership at, but it's more of a compact version, and better than many of the casino or hotel gyms I have used.",2
"My husband and I enjoyed BLT Burger on our last visit, and we were just as happy with it this time! We both got the Classic with different toppings I got Cheddar, he got American and avocado. I ordered mine medium well, and it was basically well, but it was still very flavorful and not at all dry. We ordered a strawberry milkshake, which was good. We shared an order of sweet potato fries, which were great. I ordered a drink with strawberries, orange juice, and gin not sure why, as I am not normally a gin drinker , but it was very good. n nOne minor complaint I asked for no tomato on my burger, and they had obviously put a tomato on top of the onion and then removed it prior to bringing it to the table. It didn't really bother me, but if you have allergies, you may want to be careful with special requests. n nI think this was the least expensive dinner we had while in Vegas, but we loved it!",2
"We had dinner with my husband and my son here. So disappointed with the service our server Anne D never attend to our needs we have to ask her couple of times or get it ourselves.

It may seem like they are such a nice company bc they want your business but beware horrible customer service. The unit itself can hardly ever help you they say you have to call the 800 number. They have the right at anytime to raise your rent. Hit you with 34 dollar late fee's after the 6th day and if your short just 1 they don't wait till you make your next payment nope they slap another fee of 50! That's your lien fee and then start sending you auction notices. All before your next payment due date.,1

"I decided to go to them bc I heard good reviews and they gave me a pretty decent quote. I needed an AC system repair which takes about 5 6 hours. The job got done but they took entirely too long to do it. Along with their poor communication skills due to their lack of calling, I never knew when I was getting my car back. I dropped my car off on a Monday afternoon and didn't end up getting it back until wednesday right before they closed. During that whole time they only called me once, and every time I called to see if my car was ready they gave me a new finish time. They didn't even call to notify me that my car was finished. They got the job done at a reasonable price, but you run the chance of being car less for a while which is pretty difficult and frustrating for me.",1
"One of the most disappointing things in the Phoenix Metropolitan is that restaurants close extremely early on weekdays. That is not the case with Ticoz. I was driving around Downtown Phoenix looking for any place to eat after picking up my friend at a nearby hotel. We found a quaint little place that was illuminated, and we decided to give it a shot. n nWhen we came inside, it felt like we are at a lounge in Hollywood. There were not many people, but the few customers who were dining or drinking seemed to be having a great time. We ordered a hummus appetizer and ordered some drinks. I have not had a sangria since the Wynn Sunday Champagne, and I decided to go with the Watermelon Sangria. Next thing you know, I ordered 2 more sangrias of different flavors. It was absolutely amazing and the prices are pretty reasonable for drinks. n nI had great service and felt like I have been a customer for years. Ticoz is a great find if you are wandering around for a cool place to chill in Downtown Phoenix.",2

"AVOID THIS OFFICE AT ALL COSTS. n nOverall, I am beyond appalled that this office is in business. n nTo begin my horror story at this sleazy establishment, I was referred to them from my insurance. The service is absolutely horrible. It took me 3 months to schedule an initial appointment my appointments were cancelled on me multiple times . In addition, they would not permit me to have a cleaning at the same time as my ""evaluation "" or whatever their term for it was . n nWhen I finally did get to meet with them for an exam the wait time in their lobby is very long , my X Rays were taken and the dentist, Dr. Berger, came to take a look at my teeth. Never once did he make eye contact or utter a word to me. He was in and out within a minute or two and only spoke to the hygienist very awkward . I was then taken to a room to see my diagnosis. A completely separate woman who I had never seen before explained my 3000 diagnosis. She urged me to make appointments ASAP for all of this work. I haven't even had a cavity in years so I said I would go and get another opinion.

"Let's be honest, this hasn't been one of the ""nicer "" malls in the PHX area for quite some time, but even as it was getting knocked down a peg or two as new malls were built and or renovated this was still kind of nice place to go shopping since it still had your usual mall stores food court options albeit in a less nice setting , but with smaller crowds. n nWell, I came here for this the first time in forever recently to kill some time before getting an eye exam close by, and let's just say I spent more time than I was planning in the waiting room there since I spent hardly any time in the mall. It seems like 3 4 of the stores here have become those cheap, disposa clothes stores a lot of the spaces are closed up all together. The top floor of Dillard's was closed off when I was here and from what I can tell this is a permanent thing with everything converted to one floor. n nAlso, the food court here is terrible. I mean, I can appreciate that other than the Panda Express most of the restaurants seem to be independently owned places, but yeah, they still don't seem all that great. In addition, the escalators weren't working while I was here, and I kind of got the impression this has been the case for awhile and will continue to be the case for quite sometime. n nNot that is necessarily pertains to the mall itself, but I was sad to see this whole area in general is pretty much dead.

"" WHAT? You go through this trouble to bring in great beers like Ballast Point and New Belgium, and you can't even spend the 5 minutes to type up and print out what is on tap for the week? Why can other bars accomplish this task? Every staff member should be given this list, asked to remember it, and I will give you 5 stars immediately. n n Another reason that most likely contributes to not knowing what is behind the bar, is that, one can not actually see the bar. It is so dark in this place granted that's not always a bad thing but you need to put lights over your bar showcasing all of the liquor bottles you have so you can sell the stuff! I can't even see the bartender as they disappear into ""the Abyss "" of darkness. n nI will come back to this place again because the staff does do a pretty good job. Just please get the beer menu out, and hang some lights over the bartenders and bring the food prices down a notch. n n FD n nUPDATE 7 15 13 n nThey've added a draft list television over the kitchen, which helps to see what beers are in. but it isn't up to date usually.

"This review is just about the venue. I came here for the Jonny Craig show last night. I was expecting a large bar area but that is definitely not the case. It's super tiny. It's very homey, with a small stage area. You can touch the performers as they play. I like smaller venues so it worked for me. It's in the middle of nowhere and there is loads of parking for free in the immediate area. Eat before you come because there is no food in the immediate area. But if you like the smaller venue vibe I'd definitely go see a show here. Oh and bonus points for the big Boston Red Sox banner thats hanging in the bar area.",2
"This is my 100th review for 2014 it's been a ride. n nI so wanted to be impressed by this restaurant.

The voucher was u00a329 for a 3 course seasonal menu and a glass of Galvin Champagne. nMuch to our surprise we found the menu to have that exact seasonal menu to be . u00a329. Huh?! so we got a voucher and all we really got on this purchase was the glass of champagne. n nNot to be disheartened we did realise that whether with or without the voucher we were still getting a fine dining meal for a reasonable price, but seriously a voucher should present a significant discount. Not just a free glass of bubbly. n rant over n nThe restaurant is on the first floor of the Waldorf Astoria The Caledonian at the west end of Princess Street. On arrival we had the concierge to bring us up and the Maitre D' took our reservation, vouchers and coats. n nWe were led to our table shoed in and we took a good look at the surroundings and the menu. The main feature is a massive rose quartz I think chandelier. The rest of the dining room is a little Wedgewood pale blues and off whites. Table decor is minimalist and functional. There are understated Christmas decorations, but not overly so. n nThe seasonal menu is 3 course affair with a choice of 2 Starter 2 Mains 2 Desserts. n nWe both took the same and I was impressed with the taste and craftsmanship of the dishes n nPressing of Confit Duck with Wild Mushrooms Smoked Bacon n nLoin Braised Belly of Pork, Haricot Blanc, Roasted Artichoke n nWhite Chocolate Pannacotta, Orange Sauce, Pistachio Biscotti n nWe also were presented with some hors d'oeuvres which were tasty, but I cannot recollect what they were. As when tasting them I was looking at the wine list. nMistake. nA decent glass of wine is u00a311 yes, you read that right. ONE glass. I am sure there is a reason for this, there should be. n nThe service was impeccable, the waiters explained the dishes and as a good restaurant does crumbed the table between courses. n nWe even got a parting gift box with Edinburgh fudge when we left, now that is a nice touch! n nIn all I can actually recommend going here as you will be pleased with the dishes and if their seasonal menu prices hold you will be in for a treat!",2

"Cons Horrible customer service! nDropped by 2 days in a row. The first was Thursday September 2nd 2011 I remember, it was the day of the Sade concert . I was in a rush and didn't have much time, but that didn't stop KJ, one of the barbers from picking an choosing the customers he wanted to serve at random. I remembered that I have called him on his cell before, and was told he doesn't take appointments. This was not a huge problem, so I left and went about my business. The following day.Saturday September, 3rd 2011, I returned at approximately 2 00pm. Every seat was occupied accept for a bench in the back by the restroom. The barber I just mentioned KJ's chair faces this bench, and his customers typically wait for him here although there is only space for 2 people. This is the bench where 2 customers came the previous day and were given advanced service while I and others waited. They gave him a fist jab, maybe this made the difference.who knows On this visit he pulled customers from the main waiting area, ignoring me. I grew skeptical but remained calm for a little over an hour, until a gentleman entered the barbershop and asked KJ if he was available, to which he replied ""I'm booked all day, sorry "". I thought to my self ""I have been personally told that he does not do appointments, perhaps he's changed his policy since I last asked "". After he takes a break to read a book, he serves 2 more customers and sweeps the hair from his area and organizes the products and equipment around his sink. He walks over the owner of the shop Chris' chair and whispers something to him, casually strolls back and says with a condescending grin ""there some seating open over there, man "" before sitting down in his barber chair to finish his book. I return to the main waiting area and notice there are only 2 people waiting, me and another customer. I was appalled, every single customer who arrived before or after me had been already been served. I was pissed at this point, but desperately needed a haircut so I waited. After the last customer leaves Chris' the owner chair, Chris nods me over, I stand up place my magazine which by the way I finished while waiting.every single article then the other customer starts to sit down. He tells the customer that I'm next, and after a brief exchange, Chris shrugs his shoulders and says nervously ""I don't know who is was here first "". I say it doesn't matter as I get up and walk out of the door. Just so you know, I always tip for me and my girlfriend who gets her hair styled there as well , and I tip well! The female hairdresser there even recognized me and asked me about my girlfriend, who by the way is also no longer a customer. Worst experience of my 28 years of getting haircuts, if you're new in Arizona and need a Haircut, go to the Hair Society in South Phoenix it's well worth the drive and cuts are on point ! n nPros Talented hair cutters.",1
"Great customer service, attentive and a good quote.",2
I stop here periodically when I need something I forgot somewhere else or couldn't find. I find their prices to be high compared to other chains unless you happen to hit a sale for the item you want. n nThe store always seems a bit cluttered and even messy. There is often stock in plastic boxes on the floor waiting to be shelved. It's just not a pleasant place.,1
"Just waited 45 minutes, 32 for a table then got seated and waited around for 13 minutes for a server to come by. Meanwhile the other tables were being tended to as we were being ignored.

"Living in Central Phoenix I recently heard of this market through a friend who lives in Scottsdale would like to know why there isn't at least one of these markets in Phoenix. I fell in love. This place is like Trader Joe's and Sprouts love child. I was amazed by their fruit. I find that going to a lot of other grocery stores their fruit seems tasteless even bitter. I bought tangelos and organic apples from this place and ate all my fruit within the same night. They have an incredible array of organic, vegetarian and vegan foods all at reasonable prices. I have been trying my best to go organic, even trying to eat vegetarian and find it difficult to do with so many tasteless options. Sunflower Market was able to provide even more than expected for my vegetarian meals. Also weird side note, I am a huge fan of garbanzo beans and find a lot of places have ""eh "" garbanzo beans, wow, these are yummy. I threw them in a vegetable soup I also bought from there, super good! I also purchased some organic beauty products and hemp lotion. They had stuff I haven't seen anywhere else. Lots of what they had smelled wonderful, not just the herbal scent a lot of natural products I have used tend to have. Give it a try, perhaps when you have a little extra time on your hands to check it out. I also go online to see their weekly adds. They really load their adds up with all sorts sales and items.",2

"This place is so cute! I went here on Saturday night at about 8 30 or so. I ordered the chicken sammich with cheese, bacon, and gravy and the BF got a grilled cheese with bacon. We sat outside and it was lovely! I started with a hurricane, and let me tell you.it was ridic good! One of the best hurricanes I have ever tasted definitely look for the nights when they have specials on the drinks on FB.it's worth it . Anyway, the food came out and not only was my sammich HUGE, but it was in a pool of gravy. I didn't even know how to begin eating it. I went with the messy method and picked this giant sammich up. Mmmm. The chicken was fresh and juicy, the gravy was rich and tasty and the bacon was flavorful. This was not a light dinner, but it was totally delicious. The BF said his grilled cheese was good, but he wished it was on regular bread instead of a biscuit. I really like that this place uses local ingredients. I will definitely be back in the near future I really want to try a burger.yummmm .",2

The first time I ordered the house special which was St. Louis style ribs, and let me tell you, they were the best ribs I have ever had! The second time I went, I got the short rib, and it was delicious. My only regret so far has been that we have not saved room for dessert, I am so looking forward to the chocolate covered bacon!",2

We were so upset, we were about to leave the place. After we told him you took so long to bring our order, instead of apologizing he said ""marry Christmas!

When me and my wife go to Vegas we usually fancy the nicer hotels in Vegas. Monte Carlo was never on my list of hotel to visit but my aunt offered to send us on a little weekend getaway and I didn't want to break the bank so I suggested we look at more modestly priced hotels so me and my wife decided on the Monte Carlo. We were really hoping that we didn't make a super bad choice and to my surprise we did not. as a matter of fact we really loved the hotel and the room and all the amenities that came with the room. I must say that the Monte Carlo has totally changed my mind and I know for a fact that I will be returning here in the future.,2

If you want a traditional Steak House you found it! Old nostalgic western setting and delicious full portions you won't leave here disappointed! This place came highly recommend to me. I ordered the Smoke prime rib french dip sandwich. The best I've ever tasted! Every bite juicier than the next. With creamy horseradish sauce and wide streak fries perfectly crisp. The restaurant's history can be seen and smelled throughout. Garnished with John Wayne photos and western props makes this place a hidden gem! Will be returning soon.,2

Turnover is horrendous past 6 months. Service sub par and orders come out wrong. 3 out of 5 orders wrong in last two weeks of purchase.,1
"I usually wouldn't submit a negative review for this type of place, but, its SHITTY and thought everyone should know. Unfortunately we ordered a part from here. Came back to be the wrong one, sent back and was supposed to have new one overnighted, two weeks later we get it and it's wrong, but they say because we could t find the receipt we could t return I because they have no record system that keeps their customers interactions orders logged. Unreal.",1
"A sad day for me, to say the least. For a solid decade I've considered Chevy's to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat. Yeah, I'm a white dude who likes the white washed mexican.so what? its delicious! The chips and salsa are epic! So I'm down in Vegas visiting some friends and I suggest we hit up Chevy's for lunch, so we hit up the ONLY Chevy's around which is down at the mall in Henderson across from Sunset Station. We walk in with 3 adults and 2 kids, both 2 years old. So of course, they take us off the beaten path and stick us in the back corner so as not to disturb anybody.which is fine and dandy, EXCEPT WHEN THEY FORGET ABOUT YOU! First round of drinks and chips salsa was pushing 10 minutes from being seated. I order an apple juice for my daughter and they're all out. I then ask for a chocolate milk instead and.you guessed it.they're all out! My wife asks for a side of lemons for her ice water. First the server says they're out, then changes his mind and says they have lemons but no limes. Well, they never came. Fast forward about another 45 minutes. Mind you, we've had ZERO drink refills at this point. Out comes my plate of Chicken Fajitas.that's it. So we're sitting and waiting another 5 or so minutes and ask where the rest of the food is. The server apologized and said the flautas took the longest, hence the delay in delivery. Since when does deep fried food take longer? Well, I've finally decided I had enough and spoke to the manager. She was super nice and ended up comping half of our bill and surrounding us with great service for the small remainder of our stay. She even made it a point to have the server bring out lemons, so of course, he brought a side of limes. I thought they were out of limes? When all was said and done, it took nearly 2 hrs to eat here when it wasn't busy AND with 2 fussy toddlers. This is easily the worst Chevy's experience I've ever had. I'll stick to the ones in CA!",1
Food was amazing and portioned perfect for my night out in Vegas. Not too much but rich. But we had reservations and no one was inside and it still took 25 min to seat us. Then the food took so long that we could not get to our desserts we ordered. Did they charge us for it? Yes they did. n nPlease looks great and everyone here is nice and knowledgeable but only go here is you only plan to eat here for the evening. it takes that long for the food to come out. Plan on having at least 3 hours for your meal. n nWhy a 2? bc we told them up front we had to be somewhere. we told the waiter that we had to be somewhere and he assurred us that everything would come out on time. That being said and for them not to be able to get us our desserts and still charge us for it don't sound right.,1
Both the service and the food are great. And the materials are of really good quality! One of the best Japanese restaurants at Waterloo!,2
It's mainly the cilantro mousse that keeps me coming back to Padre's or perhaps the black bean soup and the pesto pasta. Decent sangria and margaritas and consistently good service. There seems to be something for everyone's tastes on the menu I've taken picky eaters here a few times and they have always been happy.,2
This review is for the pinacolada cheesecake only. I died and went to heaven. OMG.,2
I came here for my besties bachelorette party and definitely was not expecting what we saw. I truly thought it was going to be a full on strip show and was pleasantly surprised that it ended up being more of a show. It was quite entertaining moreso because the guys would basically do dance numbers. I wouldn't see the guys again.I would much rather spend my money on food and other entertainment like a cirque du soleil show.,1
"When you go to a basketball game, you hear a swish.it's probably a good thing. I had a couple of good friends in town over the weekend, and as soon as they said Shabu Shabu, I thought.SWISH! n nI read some very positive reviews from Misti Y, Lily D., Teri C. and Anthony M. If my yelpers think it's good, then it has to be right? n nYup! n nBefore I go on, I'd like to point out that I knocked off one star, only because of the awkward seating arrangements. n nEverything else about this place? FANTASTIC! Food was delicious. I had the Meat Lovers Kobe Rib Eye and Prime Rib Eye . Normally the Meat Lover's also has Kobe Chuck, but since they were out of Kobe Chuck, I got extra Kobe Rib Eye. Hey, I'm not complaining. More premium meat thats what she said? n nThe vegetables were plentiful and flavorful. The establishment was clean. But the best part? I was able to get my fix of 90s pop music! Granted it was all boy band music, but it was hilarious because it took me back to the days of late high school early college. Pretty hilarious stuff. n nAll in all, Swish lived up the hype by my fellow Yelpers. n nNext time, I want to try the Mushroom Party literally, a mix of 5 different kinds of mushrooms . Pretty awesome if you like mushrooms. n nCheck it out though. You won't be disappointed. Promises Promises and more Promises.",2

"The family and I along with a couple friends decided to try this place for a little variety. The experience was less than stellar. If I could give no stars I would. n nThe Bad Kids both wanted a cream soda bottled and when the waitress came back she informed us there was only one bottle left.really? It's soda for crying out loud. I decided to order a Kiltlifter some special edition and again.OUT! Now I'm slightly annoyed.Friday night, full house and by the way.also informed the kitchen is about 25 minutes ""behind "" so if we wanted to order an appetizer it would be best to put it in with our dinner order. Ok, whatever.we decided to order nachos. Nacho's came out STONE COLD, sent them back as they were inedible. The manager then came over he was very nice, apologetic and again telling us the kitchen was ""behind "" apologized, offered to ""buy us a round "" that didn't happen by the way even though we ordered a couple more rounds in the 2.5 hours we were there and wanted to make sure we were ""happy "". Out comes nacho plate number 2, by the manager stating they were ""fresh out of the oven "". Not so much, again.STONE COLD ON cold plate. Ugh.didn't bother sending them back as it clearly was not going to do any good. So finally out comes dinner.everyone had yes you guessed it.cold food. By this time we just wanted to leave. So along comes the waitress, who is clearly annoyed and drops off the check.nachos included. Now one would think that if the manager came over, offered a round of drinks and apologized profusely about cold food and slow kitchen service that the nachos would have never made it to the bill. Needless to say we just paid and left.and will never return. Robert Irvine would be having a field day in this place! Total bill for a family of 4 for cold food and a couple beers 78 that included my barely deserved 15 tip normally I go 20 all the way.not this time n nThe Good 1. Apologetic manager that seemed sincere, but clearly didn't follow through with any amount of customer service. 2. At least the beer was cold. n nSave your money as there are plenty of other beer sports bars with much better service and hot food. Can't believe this place had a full house!",1
"Strangely rude. Seems I did not know what I wanted before I arrived and that must have upset them. We were the only ones there at 1pm on a Saturday. n nFunny that the house of Egg Roll only had one spring roll option. n nInterior was tacky, run down and just plain sad.",1
"Took Expedition in for inspection. Got the call that everything passed except for front ball joints. Cost? 645! Ball joints from Autozone cost 34 each. I asked the mechanic doing the inspection how far out of spec the joints were. He couldn't give me a spec. Only that in his opinion, it was too loose. I told them I would get the work done myself, citing the cost of the ball joints, to which he replied, ""well, we're not the lowest cost on the block. "". n nI got the joints replaced for 1 5 of the estimate from Firestone. And 2 mechanics that I went to both indicated they would not have failed the inspection for those joints. n nSo here is the point. My experience with this shop might be out of the ordinary, but it is the experience you dread when taking your automobile in for a mandated inspection. My advice is to get a second opinion when a shop like this springs something like this on you. Unfortunately, most people just pay the price and go on. If you are able to get a second opinion, I would encourage it. n nThe workers at this shop are friendly. Like I said, I hope my experience was an anomaly. But I won't be back, even though the location is very convenient to where I live. n nBtw. The truck passed inspection when I took it back in.",1

I have been here twice and both times were horrible. My husband went there once because his GPS said it was closer to the house than the one off of Craig and Scott Robinson which is head over heels better . He said he could barely eat it but he did because he was hungry. n nDon't go! You'll save money and your taste buds from a bad meal.,1
Ordered the enchiladas. hardly any chicken and very little flavor. and for 16! Service was spotty as well. Will not return. Very disappointing.,1
"I started going to this cafe in January of 2013. I really like the ambience and the setting of the cafe itself. Their Peet's coffee was great during those times. Pastries and breads are good and well presented. I have spread the word about this cafe to my friends in and outside of Las Vegas and voila, they do visited the place because of my recommendation. My friend and I frequent the place because of their Peet's coffee and our favorite Palmier Elephant Ear to some . However, the more we have our coffee there, we noticed that the taste is getting sour and bitter. This happened three times. We made complaints about the taste and unfortunately, it seemed like they were not happy about it. Being consistent customers, we were thinking that they will be accommodating with our complaints but we were given cold shoulders. We stopped going until we decided to give them another try. We missed the place that we thought of ordering our fave coffee. This time, coffee is great! We will be going to this local French Cafe once again. Afterall, we want to help local businesses.",2
"Nothing too special here. It's a great spot. Looks nice inside but it's so loud we could barely hear each other talk may be just where we were sitting Salsa was good and so was creamy jalepeno, Tuesdays happy hour special was Margaritas which was a bonus but they were just OK, not too impressed with my shrimp tacos either, should be grilled and not fried. I had higher hopes for Chuys, have definitely had better and is nothing to write home about.",1
"Their Pho seems to be a miracle cure for colds. Their spring rolls are also quite tasty. I've only done take out here, so can't comment on service. Prices are great, lots for your dollar.",2
"Horrible. Instead if charging kids by age, they charge by height. Kool with me. However, they dont want to charge you while you're at the front desk getting seated, the waitstaff who barely speaks english would seat you first, let you eat for 10mns, then ask you how many people and what are the ages of the kids. Then come this loooooong broken english explanation of how they charge, then they ask for the height of the kids, then age again. WTF! Just have a damn ruler at the front and do that instead if they want to charge u by height! In fact, I should get charged half price because I'm shorter than 5' ! It took us 10 minutes to get the head count straightened out we had a party of 14, kids and infants included and she would bring you the check and literally stay at the table and watched me bust out my purse to pay. This is barely 15 minutes getting seated and I literally was still chewing while she stood by after handing me the check. Rude. I could have paid first! nThe variety of food is lacking for a buffet. i've had better. You're better off going somewhere else. However, I did come on a weekday. nNote My 3 yr old son was charged 7 because when they asked me for age, I said 3 yrs old and I guess they thought I said 3 feet. LOL. Other places, he's usually free. I don't have the time to try to argue with them on that since they barely speak english.",1
there are better greek mediterranean places around.,1
Hidden gem. Atmosphere is great. Cozy place. I visited on a Thursday so wasn't very busy. Took a look at the menu and was explained everything. Ordered and sat down. Grabbed my drink and while waiting they brought a granola appetizer while we waited for our food. Granola was amazing. n n nI ordered the breakfast burrito. nGreat portions and very tasty. Added the chorizo for a little kick. Was highly recommended and didn't disappoint. Flavors were all there and the burrito didn't stand a chance. n nAfter my burrito tried the popular Nutella banana br u00fbl u00e9e. A tad sweet if you're not used to it but delicious nonetheless. Highly recommend it. n n nOverall great experience and will gladly visit again. Love the environment and absolutely enjoyed my meal.,2
"My family of four went in for breakfast. This is a very small but cute establishment. There was only one open table that was able to seat six and they wouldn't seat us. The hostess wanted to leave the table open ""just in case a larger party came in "", rather than seating the customers they already had. They wanted us to wait at the front for a smaller table to open up. Once we convinced her to let us have the table the hostess was extremely rude and told us with a really sarcastic tone of voice that she would get our server. We ended up leaving before she came back because the customer service was just so bad. I would not recommend if you're looking for friendly service.",1
"I don't see what the hype is about this place. My lovely British boyfriend wanted to go to Nando's for a quick lunch before we did some sightseeing and told me I would love it. I mean, I like chicken and all, but I was extremely underwhelmed by my experience there. It's just a chicken wrap with a choice of a few sauces. The hottest hot sauce is WEAAAAAKKKK. Seriously, I want to cry while I'm eating my spicy chicken wraps. Also, I got the mashed peas as a side and it was the strangest thing on the planet I do not recommend trying them. I mean, I would eat here again, but wouldn't rate it high on my list of places to go to! n nAs a footnote, I also do not see the hype about Chick Fil A and Church's Chicken in America down in the South and everyone raves about both spots.",1
Very nice little shop. I went in to get Cinnabun which was fresh and wonderful. Can't wait to try the sandwiches. n nUpdate. The sandwiches are awesome. The breads are out of this world!,2

'If you don't spot by this place the next time you're in Vegas. consider yourself a f ckin donkey'. Service was okay but the food was great a little bit on the heavy side . This place is better then Ramsey's spot in The London Hotel in LA,2
"FOOD POISONING! Had oysters, beef tartare, and tuna tartare for appetizers! 12 hours of excruciating vomiting from both ends of my body. Plus our server kept touching my arms and shoulders and sat down at the table every time he stopped by. If you want to have a conversation forget it, the DJ plays way too loud to hear anything. Stay away!",1
"The weather was muy caliente. Mi padre y mi esposa were mucho thirsty and in need of cervezas frias! This place quenched our thirst and sated our hunger pangs as well with their grande chips y salsa which were muy delicioso! And it was happy hour to boot, which was good because our cervezas cost us fewer pesos! Muy bueno! I glanced at the menu, and it was overwhelmingly huge with lots to choose from. But since our primary reason for stopping was to cool off on a hot Phoenix afternoon, we'll have to come back at a later date to try the food.",2
"Don't ever come here unless you want basic and I mean basic customer service. We stayed here Super Bowl weekend, one night they had water issues and shut down everything. When I mean everything, I mean everything except the tables and the slots. n nWe were staying in the hotel and we had no water in our room between 11pm and 7am not sure 7am is true as writing this while water is out, we will see in a few hours if this time frame is true . We were told if we need the bathroom we should go to the casino next door. So I'm enjoying my time in Vegas was and I wake in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and I have to go down 10 floors and walk to the hotel next door. n nThere solution to the problem was we will send you some water. Well we had a hot tub room and they were not happy when I said I needed a thousand bottles of water for my room. I know things go wrong and there is not much you can do but to tell you go next door for for the bathroom is a joke. n nI have stayed at this hotel and casino many times and loved it, it was also called The Imperial Palace. They have changed the name to The Quad, Q can only stand for questionable, because the decisions they made were outrageous. n nThe location is good that is all I can say",1
"This was my second and LAST time to visit The Keg. The food is always decent, and good selection of cocktails too. But the service was terrible. We were seated on the patio along with several other guests, but for some reason our server only had one table on the patio us. And she constantly forgot about us. It took about 30 minutes to get our drinks and place our order. The food was out in reasonable time someone else delivered it . But then no check to see if everything looks good, is as ordered, nada. After we got our food, we didn't see her again for 30 minutes! Our food was gone, but empty plates remained. Our first round of cocktails was long gone and we would have had more if offered . By the time she came out to bring us our check even our waters were bottomed out! She brought the check with no apology and didn't offer to refill drinks, and left the dirty and obviously empty plates. We gave her our credit card right away fearing we may not see her again for another hour. And if you can believe it we sat for another 30 minutes after giving her our card! At this point, we missed the movie we were hoping to catch and we were not happy. She came back out to patio, saw us, and rudely asked ""did she not bring you the check?!? "". we say, ""ummm no "" thinking, obvioulsy not, we are still here amongst dirty dishes and empty glasses. she stormed off with a huff and no explanation or apology. The manager brought out our final check a few minutes later and did end up apologizing for the internal miscommunication, and offered to buy us another round of drinks. We passed after sitting for 2 hours at this place we wanted to run far far away. IMO he shouldn't have charged us for the first round of drinks when he personally ran our card. But no, he went ahead and charged us full price for everything with only an offer for a couple of drinks. We will NEVER eat here again. Terrible service.",1

"Absolutely the Worst! Where should I begin, how about being sick with intestinal disorder tithe entire next day! Or maybe ordering the Venison Medium and having it come out blood red and cold. Or making reservations three weeks in advance and getting seated facing away from the ""Strip "" overlooking the parking deck in a converted room designed for storage but used for dinning. I was told that they had 700 reservations for the night. My wife had the Lamb, with a side of undercooked Cold tomato ratatouille. We think this is what got us sick. If you want to have a 100 per person dinner, have terrible underprepared food and be put in perhaps the worst seat in a restaurant that promotes it's view and be sick the next day then call the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, they will be happy to accomadate.",1
"Siegfried and Roy's secret garden , where do i start. I guess it was pretty okay . ish. Dolphins were cool , untrained but cool. I wouldnt have minded seeing a backflip or something. I did form a kinship with one of them , he had banished himself to the corner and i named him echo. Okay so it wasnt a kinship it was me staring at a dolphin in a corner calling him echo. Other then that its an incredibly small place as far as habitats go, this could be why its a secret garden. White tigers and lions are very cool to see no matter where they are with the possible exception of my house. Alpaca's? they must have filled a shipping bill out incorrectly, how these sheep goats that do absolutaly nothing wormed their way into the habbitat i will never know. Either way as i said a little dissapointed in the size of the place and diversity of animals but realistically i got what i came to see, including overpriced photos of the girlfriend kissing a cgi lion .yay.",1
"I know folks are crazy about this place, but it is just okay with me. I have been here many times and on various days of the week time. It is hit or miss, some of the cakes are really moist and others are really dry, yet their frosting is always nice. I don't know, in fact I went today and purchased two. I like to support local businesses and guess I keep hoping for more moist cake. I still prefer a place in Charlotte, but can not always get there, so this is a nice alternative for sweet tooth.",1
Not very good for lunch a couple weeks ago. Chicken was bone dry and the service was just 2 or 3 servers watching tv until they noticed my empty cup on the edge of the table.,1
"My wife and i had the pleasure of dining here on 1 4 14. We were seated right away. The ambiance was good, i caught the football game from the bar located right in the middle of the place. The service Alice was some of the best i've ever experienced and i waited tables for several years in my college years . I asked about the adovado and she quickly brought out a sample of the pork for us to try. She also noticed i had pulled up the free guac on check in on my phone and had it to our table in about a minute. You just don't get that level of service from most places now a days. I chose the plate that had 3 different options. I had the pork adovado, shredded beef buro and the chicken taco. Everything was excellent. The adovado was the best i've had. I would highly recommend this and have already done so to immediate family.",2
"If I could give them 0 stars, that would make me happy! I will never purchase anything from them ever again.

"Once again, yelp has not failed me. This place has great food. The meat was tender and very flavorful, and the salad was fresh with the dressing spot on.

No one is there and you basically have to call in and speak to someone about booking them as movers. I really want to see the type of place that I am entrusting my personal belongings with. I spoke to someone on the phone who was very rude and that's why I chose to go with a different moving company. If you want to make money, I suggest you get someone who actually knows what customer service is.",1
"I feel obligated to write this review because this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. n nMy sister, mom, grandmother and I went out to have an afternoon drink on our day off. It all started off fine. The margarita's came and my sister and I had to send ours back because they were made incorrectly with salt, on the rocks instead of frozen . They were tasty so we decided to have one more. After having to GET UP to find the waitress we were the ONLY patrons in the dining area she brought our second round, only one mistake this time, and my salad. n nI had to find the waitress AGAIN to ask for our check. When I checked it out I found that they had added .50 for the dressing. I know this sounds dumb, but who the hell charges for dressing for a SALAD? Come on guys, if your that broke just shut your doors. n nWhen I went to hand her the check Yes, I had to find her again I complained about the charge. Amazingly enough she brought the bill back out, but without the credit card that I had put in it. I asked her where it was and she didn't know. We looked around for a couple of minutes and still couldn't find it. After my sister said aloud that she was going to call the company and report it lost did the cook walk PAST our table to miraculously find the card on the floor. We all thought it was pretty amazing that it ended up in the booth beyond ours since I had taken up front myself. n nHorrible experience, not worth the time or money. I expect this place to close fairly soon. Hopefully someplace worthwhile will open in it's location since it is close to my house and hence convenient.",1
Everything at Albertsons seems somewhat expensive to me. They do have an excellent bakery though.,1
"First off, this place is topnotch! I would give 6 stars if I could, allow me to explain. n nThere are a few things that separate Jolta Java from the rest. The ambiance and aesthetics of this place are cozy, calming, and welcoming. There is a mini TV room, with bookshelves of books you may check out for up to 2 weeks. Comfortable chairs and tables invite you to grab a cup of joe and nestle in. n nThe menu is extensive. Sandwiches, coffees, smoothies, scones, muffins, etc, etc. I LOVE their smoked salmon BLT. It is wonderful and unrivaled compared to most coffee shop food. n nThe people that work there are chill too. There is an awesome sign draped over the cash register with a woman talking on her cellphone and says ""We WILL NOT serve you while you are on your phone. "" Good for you Jolta Java! Get those annoying people to separate the phone from their ear as a courtesy to the rest of us. n nNow, here are the little things that I noticed that makes this place stand at the top. The sandwiches are wrapped in heavy duty paper, not that thin, flimsy wrap that other places have. Love the fruit cup side that is offered. They keep your info so that every 10th drink you order is free. Talk about investing in your customers and community. n nI am a huge fan and will continue to take my business to this fine establishment!",2
"Well, I'm definitely on The fence. My first trip here was great, now my second, in the daylight, is a lot different. Kind of like going to a bar without a crowd and during the daylight.grungy. almost ""too real "". We got seated quickly and nicely. The waitress greeted us pleasantly and was prompt with the drinks. The reason we came was to watch the steelers game.reasonable enough since its an advertised steelers bar. Right? Not out of the question. So we were seated out of view of a tv with the game on and when I asked if one of the tvs that we could see could be changed, the bartender said, and I quote ""the steelers? They're 'f ing everywhere!' "". And unfortunately, that's not cool in my book. So. FAIL bikinis. Fail in my book.",1
"I had paid 30 for the delivery order including 5 tip and I regret every single cent of it ! nThe fried wonton is literally fried wonton skin! There's no cheese filling whatsoever! nThe lunch combo fried rice taste off like it was cooked like 2 days ago or something. The meat taste like fried mystery meat with sauce. The breading of the orange chicken is not crispy at all nor the sesame tofu , it has a chewy soggy breading. The sesame sauce has no flavor it just taste like syrup! nUgh I want my money back ! nWe couldn't eat anything that we ordered so we end up throwing everything away. What a waste of money !

"I was really really excited to try this restaurant. Not only because of Gordon Ramsey and his standards, but because the food looked amazing. nGot there and the line was quite long, which is fine. Went to the Asian hostess and ask for a table for 2 and she old me the wait would be 20 30 minutes. Sure, no problem. While waiting I got a call from a friend saying that he wanted to join us but wasn't sure yet. Asian Hostess comes to check again ""so table for 2 right? I'm just making sure "". I said, YES but a 3rd person might join us for drinks. She said ""oh no. That changes everything. Your wait now is going to be 1 hr. And I said ok, I will make sure he's coming and I will let you know ASAP. She looked at me and said ""AND DONT EVEN TRY TO SNEAK A 3rd PERSON TO A TABLE FOR 2, OR ELSE YOU'RE GETTING KICKED OUT! "" I was like ""excuse me? Get kicked out of a restaurant? Are you serious? "" She said ""that's how my manager is "". That KILLED my experience. I was really really upset. After that, I dont even remember how my burger tasted like. The straw is shorter than the cup. You have to fish it with your fingers to drink out of it. Definitely NOT the attitude I expected from a GORDON RAMSEY restaurant and his standards.",1
"I had breakfast at the Chompie's at the Mercado Del Rancho Center and it pains me to write that this breakfast stands out as the worst breakfast I have ever had, ever. If you think about it, you really have to go out of your way to screw up breakfast but they managed. n nWe knew we were off to a bad start when we stood at the entrance for about 5 minutes Please Wait to be Seated for someone to seat us in a 1 2 empty dining room. The waiter was attentive so no problems there. The problems started when the food arrived. 3 of us had menu variations of corn beef hash and poached eggs. The corn beef had the look and texture of road kill and the eggs were hard boiled. 2 of us requested that the eggs be re done but only one of us received it after assurances from the wait staff that it was ""on its way. "". The food was also more or less room temp when it arrived. n nTo be fair, there are a lot of Chompie's and maybe this was a bad day at a singe location. The menu is extensive and I did see other customers orders that looked more appetizing. It would appear that they have good food but the execution was the problem. We might try it again and order something different.",1
"Not impressed. My coworker and I were waiting for a movie across the street and decided to try and beat the heat by getting some ice cream. I have allergies to soy so I have to be very careful about what I eat as it is in everything these days. There were two gentlemen in the store one dark haired and kinda sullen looking, the other heavy set. I failed to get their names as I was quickly put out by our experience and just wanted to leave. nThe heavy set guy was busy with a customer so we asked the dark haired one if there was nutritional information available and politely explained I had allergies and had to be aware of everything I eat. He looked at us blankly and kind of put out sounding responded ""I have it in a book. "" There was a pause as he just stood there staring like we were some sort of circus oddity. Finally, my coworker politely asked if we could see the book. Without saying anything and with a slight roll of his eyes he turned, grabbed the book and shoved it in my face kinda rudely. I took it from him and turned away from him because it was clear he had some sort of problem. I remarked to my coworker ""Friendly. Love that "" because he clearly was not. nPerhaps he despised his low paying job. Perhaps he thought we looked too low class to be in his presence. Perhaps he was having a bad day. Perhaps he was just a jerk. Whatever the case, his unfriendliness and and our unwelcome were palpable. I flipped absentely through the book but quickly decided I really had a problem giving money to a store who had employees that seemed to think openly treating customers with disrespect was okay . Handing the book back to the employee in question, I smiled and said thank you as we left. As if this wasn't enough, as we were leaving I noted that he never took his eyes off of us and even kind of elbowed his co worker and started making some sort of comment while staring us down through the window of the store as we left. They chuckled amongst themselves if full view of us as I watched. They seemed not to care that I could see their every move. nWhen I called back after we left and asked to speak to a manager, at first I was put on hold while whoever answered said they would go get the manager. A couple seconds later, the same person came back and said, ""Oh I'm sorry. She's not here. "" He then informed me he had no idea when she would be back in. nCall me crazy, but I find it hard to believe in a store of that size one could be unaware their manager was no longer in the store and further could not give me any sort of estimation of when she was expected except to say she was ""usually "" around in the morning. nAt any rate, I have scarcely been treated so rudely in a customer service environment ever. So, to the manager, whoever you may be, I would suggest you inform your employee he should endeavor to adjust his attitude towards paying customers if he intends to continue working with the public. Honestly, I really don't care what his problem was. Not my issue. I couldn't care any less what he thought of me or my coworker. However, I steadfastly refuse to give my hard earned money to a store which allows this kind of blatantly unacceptable behavior from one of its employees. Next time, I'll just find a Ben and Jerry's or simply endure the heat without aid.",1

"Update what I failed to mention in my first post was that even though I had verified with my health insurance provider that I had a set co pay, the aforementioned twit over charged me 300 ! nWhen I tried to discuss the error with her, she condescendingly informed me that my charge was set on the computer, and if there was an over charge I would be gladly refunded. nAs a side note, it amazing how a persons words can be so far from their definition! nI ended up having to go back to Dr Copus for same illness, only to be overcharged again by 250 . nRather than argue with this rude little pion I paid the overcharge, knowing that at some point the insurance company should take care of the discrepancy. nSkip ahead 6 weeks, and I haven't heard anything, so I call my insurance company who verifies overcharge, then call said twit to inform her of her mistake. nSo I call the office, twit answers, then as soon as she realizes it's me, begins immediately using the shredder. although I suspect she merely turned on the shredder and put it in the closest proximity to my ear as she could n nUpdate2.0 nReceived a very unprofessional letter along with refund check from first overcharge saying that due to refund be demanded, I made dr Copus work on the weekend.

"Eeek. I hate giving bad reviews, but the food was pretty awful. This is Bonfire's first week open, so hopefully they are just working out the kinks, and it gets better soon. Hottie and I went for Happy hour and dinner on Friday. I wasn't thrilled with any of their HH drink specials, so I just ordered one of their specialty martini's with Prosseco and some other yummy goodness! I loved my martini, which is good because I realized they were 11 bucks a pop when I got the bill! Hottie ordered a Stella on tap, but was served a bud light, they served him another. same thing. I am convinced they had the kegs switched up. For appetizers we ordered fried pickles Hottie's choice and grilled artichoke. The pickles were dipped in a thick batter similar to that of fish and chips Ick! The artichoke was okay, but covered in oil. I mean my hands were dripping. For dinner Hottie ordered some ""Jumbo Prawn "" and Andouille Sausage skewer with a side of baked beans. His ""Prawns "" were not jumbo and they were obviously shrimp. His food was covered in oil too. I grill a lot at home and you don't need very much oil, that's what's great about grilling! For dinner, I ordered three sides, truffle and parmesan mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and grilled asparagus. The asparagus was excellent, the mac n cheese was okay, nothing special, and the potatoes were bland and dry. big disappointment. To end on a positive note, our service was good, and the concept is fresh, so I suppose we'll be back to give them opportunity for redeem themselves.we'll just give them some time to get on their game!",1

"So not worth the hype. Thanks, Adam Richman.you owe us brunch. n nThe hubby and I came here at 11 30 am on a Thursday. It wasn't busy at all. There was a 10 minute wait for the table, compared to an hour plus wait during weekends, not bad at all. However, the coffee tasted like sewer water. The signature chicken and waffles were mediocre at best the chicken was crunchy alright, but it was extremely dry and lacked flavor. The gimmicky waffles with bacon inside were below average. n nDo yourself a favor if you're craving supreme chicken and waffles, cough up an extra 15 bucks and head on over to Bouchon at the Venetian. You won't regret it. n nFurthermore, the service was appalling. Apparently, it only takes a half a brain cell to work there. We noticed that our jam container was empty, so we put it at the edge of the table. The server passed by it at least 6 times, and didn't bother picking it up for a refill. When we finally flagged down another server, our server came back and gave us a half empty jar of peach jam, not the strawberry jam we wanted. We also asked our server for butter and extra maple syrup for the waffles. It took him 15 minutes to come back! Seriously, Hash House A Go Go, I don't understand why you guys are famous.",1

So I stopped in for a quick smog check. Then they came back with this list of things that need to be fixed on my car and on that list was my timing belt! I laughed at the guy and said that was funny since I had just had my timing belt changed 2 weeks prior and the after that his only concern was why didn't I come there and how much I paid. I wasn't really thinking and told him that I had paid 670 and then he told me that he would have only charged me 570 BS!

Its been a long time since I was last in a TJ MAXX store. They have an eclectic mix of apparel and housewares. The part that I've always liked is the sweets section.

"Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain. We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wife's Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce. n nPoor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or don't go at all.",1

It's nicely decorated and the staff was super friendly. We were served warm sparkling cider too! Such a perfect drink to give us since it was cold and rainy!

"AYCE sushi? At Benihana? Yeah. How to describe it? I guess the best I can come up with is ""production sushi "". Remember those documentaries that were on TV about the painting factories where people painted the same painting day in, day out tens of times a day? That's what the sushi I had at Benihana was like. Thier crab mix was dry, the eel sauce probably came directly from a bottle that said ""Yoshinoya "" in big red letters, the soft shell crab in the spider roll had obviously been cooked some time before. The sushi ""chefs "" looked somewhat bored and unhappy, and I counted 3 botched orders to tables in the 1 1 2 hours I was there. Love good sushi? Try someplace else. Want to eat a lot of so so sushi?

"We stumbled upon the Skybox as a last minute find for a convenient and not too expensive restaurant for dinner one night. n nThe food can pretty much be summed up as ""sports bar grill "" type food. We shared an order of hot wings and I personally ordered the fish tacos. The wings were super spicy and a really decent portion size. The fish tacos were just ok, some of the fish was a little fishy tasting which always puts a damper on a meal. The rice that came with the tacos was really yummy though. n nThe meal still ended up being expensive! Four entrees, wings, and NO drinks came out to be 40 per person.

"I have been patiently waiting for this place to open up for business since I frequent the Taco stand as often as I can. We stopped in for lunch to see what they had to offer. n nI was very surprised after descending the stairs to find a very well lit, clean, and nicely decorated dining room. We were seated promptly upon entering. We tried two of the salsas Casera and Tomatillo Verde. Both tasted fresh and had good flavor, I was happy that they were not at all spicy as I'm not a fan of overly hot spicy foods. My main dish I ordered was from the Dinner menu, I thought that was cool that they were setup to make food from their Lunch and dinner menu. I tried the Traditional Moles since I thought it would give me a quick general sampling of what they can do. This dish contained 4 different mole styles. I don't know if they make their mole sauces in house but I would hope that they do. It was pretty darn good, the only complaint I had was that the Chicken in the chocolate mole was extremely dry. The serving size was pretty large and I definitely brought a portion home with me. n nThe service was outstanding and I can't believe how quickly they got our food out to us after ordering, the place did have about 4 other tables , by no means was it full but for a lunch you could definitely get done in well under an hour. The server was awesome, very knowledgeable about stuff they had to offer and was friendly and fast.",2

"Great experience here. My boyfriend and I came to this buffet on the last day of our little Vegas trip. A lady named Valerie was at the register, she was a pleasure. She was very sweet, talking to us and asking us questions making us feel very welcomed. The host who seated us was also very welcoming. n nThe food was great. There were an overwhelming amount of options but everything we tried was good. Don't skip out on the taco station, it was really good. The cooks will make you fresh tacos right there and then you add whichever salsas toppings are preferred. We didn't save room for dessert, so I can't comment on that. But all the savory food was great. n nThe buffet entrance is right next to the entrance for the pool so we stumbled out there after our meal and took a little food coma nap by the pools. Totally recommended.",2
"Coming from Charlotte, I'm an airport snob. This was the best airport I've been in besides Charlotte Douglas, though surprisingly large. There were a multitude of restaurants scattered throughout, though a very long walk to access them from certain gates. The airport gambling provided something entertaining to watch while waiting for the plane. On this Saturday, the airport was near empty and even the TSA looked bored. Refreshing to have an airport experience that wasn't hectic and confusing.",2
"I have mad love for downtown. Part of that love is nostalgia. There is my own personal nostalgia, and nostalgia for historic Las Vegas. The owners of the Golden Gate decided to preserve history at 1 Fremont Street. They went the other way when they acquired Fitzgerald's. I like that people are interested in downtown and willing to put money into its improvement. I want it to continue to grow and evolve. However, I think it would be tragic if my downtown Vegas got Nerfed. Downtown is 'come as you are.' That makes me happy. I've observed that there are two poles of intention with night life. People want to have a good time and or to see and be seen. The spirit of downtown is very much the former in my opinion. People shed their dignity on Fremont Street, unload their self consciousness, and commune with their fellow humans. If it becomes more like the strip, expensive, stratified, and snobby, then there's no point in going downtown. I think The D or D's or whatever sounds like an attempt to be modern and edgy. Whatever that means. It sounds temporary to me.",2

 This review was for a show in December I liked it even though there was a bunch of fluff that could have been taken out. We were on a budget family trip with two kids ages 9 and 10.

"If I could give this place ten stars I would. This is the epitome of AMAZING! It's passionate people doing what they love. The crazy thing is, it's not just one person, it's the whole team.

Had to try it after seeing the taco challenge on the cooking channel. The hostess was a little confused right at 11 when they opened and we were a little worried but our fears quickly subsided when our waitress and bus boy took excellent care of us. We loved the chips and the three dips and both got super fresh salads with the taco lunch special. My husband had the ground beef taco and I had the carnitas and it was filled with lots of delicious meat and we loved the beans and rice too. We asked for some hotter sauce and it was hot but tasty. We also had some delicious margaritas. We live in CA but will definitely make the trip to Leticia's the next time we are in town.,2

If looking for a very reasonably priced American Texas southern Caf u00e9, then this is the place. You will be delighted.

"I went here today for the first and last time. I needed to find a new salon after mine continued to raise their prices. I stopped in and it looked clean. I was not greeted, just told ""pick a color "". It did not have a friendly vibe at all. They spoke in Vietnamese to each other and I felt like they were talking about the customers. My pedicure took 20 minutes, the massage was terrible, wrapped cold, stained towels around my legs and burned my skin with a callus remover I did not request. I was on edge the entire time I was there and felt like it was the biggest waste of 25 dollars in my life. As I left I was not told goodbye or thank you and that is why I want to let everyone know to avoid this place at all cost.",1
"I realize that a place that has a majority of their menu priced under 2.00 is not going to blow me away. BUT, the wait times are HORRIBLE! Whether you go in or the drive thru it's bad either way. I'm in Boca Park quite often, so I'll run in from time to time it's NEVER good! The employees are rude it's always 15 20 min wait times! The only reason it gets an xtra star is I can get a side salad with low cal dressing for 1.00. I've never been to a McDonalds that was this consistently bad.",1
"I have never left a review on Yelp before but I was inspired to download the app just to warn people about this place. I wish I would have looked at reviews before I came here today. I used to make the drive from north scottsdale, all the way over to glendale just for this restaurant when I was 16 to let's say 20. I am now 30 and decided to mix things up with my girlfriend and try my favorite from when I was a kid. This place has gone down hill in a hurry. I laughed audibly out loud when I read the review previously written saying they think it changed hands. I had just done a Google search on my phone to see if they sold out. The owner must have gotten a new manager or food provider. The food made me sick. I ordered whole wheat pasta with the reduced fat marinara and it came out like a bowl of soup.

"What the heezy happened in this joint? I walked into Le Thai pumped for Penang last night but I walked out of Le Thai me Is Money shaking my head. n nAfter slinging back some cocktails at the Mob Bar with a few home fries, we trekked over to Le Thai for a pad thai party. We were sat right away on the covered patio outside, at which we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. What's a girl gotta do to get some agua around here when she's dehydrated from the drinking? Wait, I guess. Our server later came around to take drink orders, and while the same people who complained about the cold opted for ICED Thai tea, I asked for a glass of hot water. The teas came by, but lo and behold, no water is this because we're having conservation issues? No matter I waved down a busser who came by right away with the missing goods. n nOur roster consisted of Thai style wings, Thai beef noodle soup, Penang curry with brown rice, tom yum soup, and short rib fried rice. The food was actually really good, which was enhanced by the cold weather and my declining buzz. Plus, the soup was so perfect in the cold, until we realized that was it we were sitting IN THE COLD, and only 1 of the 3 heat lamps were on. We asked a staff member if we could turn on the extra heat lamps, and we were shut down, being told that heat lamps actually weren't even really allowed, given the cover on the patio and all. As we watched the last of the heat lamps die out though, he refilled the lamp as if to do us a favor. n nThe curry came out with white rice which was frustrating if it hadn't been for another employee who pitched in yet again, but it wasn't anything compared to the irritation we harbored when we went to pay the check and were told they could only make four transactions total after we had calculated the payment for six people. One of us opted to pay with cash, and the change was rounded up because they did not carry change I'm not sure if this was just the server, or the restaurant as a whole, but either way, it doesn't seem to make much business CENTS. n nI've never had much of an issue with the food here, but the service is just such a hit or miss ALL THE TIME, with it being more of a miss lately. I feel like I'm throwing the place under the bus, but I suppose this is the same disappointment my parents felt when I told them I wasn't going to be pre med, and they've managed to move on.",1
"This is a cute cafe with organic food and a very relaxed atmosphere. You also have the option to dine outside which makes your experience even more relaxing. Most of the menu items are gluten free and vegan which makes it a very healthy dining option. During lunch they offer combos, soup and salad or sandwich with soup or salad. I tried the summerlin soup which was just ok. However, the chicken sandwich was great, I would totally recommend it. They also have a yummy selection of pastries and gelato! The customer service is great, they definitely try the best to connect with their customers and make you feel welcomed. n Apparently they are also open for dinner!",2

I was expecting a NY style pizza as they mentioned over the phone. nSo I went ahead and spent the 30 on two Large NY Cheese Pizzas and an order of garlic knots. nThe pizza cheese was not soft and melted like other pizzas and there was no flavor at all to them. The other thing that I hated was that most of the cheese were bubbled up and burnt. My family can usually finish a whole pizza and more, but this time each of us only had 1 at most 3 of us only had half . I do not recommend this place. Maybe they had an off night. In this economy, 30 for two pizzas.bad pizzas at that.",1
"If you are reading this review on Yelp, you are probably not an avid Camelback hiker. Below are some recommendations for a first timer n nI agree with the moderate difficult rating for the Echo Canyon Trail. Nothing super dangerous, but you do need to have moderate endurance and balance on your feet. Try not to carry anything in your hands as you will need them for navigating over rocks and boulders. Two spots have handrails don't be afraid to use them. n nGet there early before 6am or later around 8am during the weekday to avoid parking far away. Also, don't let the people that run up and down the mountain intimidate you I was passed by a woman walking her chiaua on her way down . Everyone is friendly and the views are worth it, so take your time. A really fun hike in the city.",2
"The service was impeccable. The staff and server were pleasant and accommodating. The food itself is a fusion of Caribbean as well as New Mexican cuisine. The dishes were decent and very unique. For example, the calamari here isn't served as what you are use to traditionally, instead it's smothered in a jerk sauce, a little too flavorful for my taste. The cous cous salad is ok nothing too special. The lamb chops were cooked nicely and beautifully presented. The sliders for me personally were the stars of the evening. I'm hoping to try the brunch soon!",2
Went for lunch and service is good and sushi rolls very good. Try the heart attack app.very yummy.,2
"Been here now a few times and each time the service seems to have improved, they are quicker to get to the table for you order and the food comes out faster. n nThe menu is quite extensive with many plates, bowls, sushi, tempura and ramen to choose from. By far the spicy pork ramen is my favorite. It's not too spicy, with good size pieces of pork and vegetables. n nI also love the kamikaze roll. It's bite size pieces are perfectly prepared, the combination of eel, spicy tuna and avocado with cucumber is truly delicious. n nOverall, the quality is good and the service is better.",2
"We went here for lunch on Saturday and it was quite busy. Service was good but slightly delayed I guess because they were busy ha! nI agree that their fries are over salted but the burgers are pretty good. Fried pickles are even better. n nWe had a reservation since I figured it may be helpful to get in faster, it helped. So if you have a family of 4 or 5 and up call and make sure the have room specially if you are going here for lunch or dinner on a weekend. n nI should have taken picture of my food.maybe next time.",2
"We stopped here on our way to Goodyear from Phoenix. We wanted to try something that we don't have back home. Simply. We made the wrong choice stopping here and there is a reason we don't have this place back home. n n It was Sunday so I had the brunch and it started off great. There is an omelet bar and a carving station, though I stayed away from that meat because it looks as it if was sitting under a heat lamp for a week. Omelet was great and so were the Eggs Benedict. Then the food quality took a nose dive. The potatoes were little rocks, the bacon was mainly just a mound of uncooked fat, most of it looked raw. The ""dessert table "" was a tiny table of donuts and cupcakes. This place was not designed to hold a buffet and that's a fact. Side note The brunch comes with all you can drink mimosas so I figured. why not? It took me 30 minutes just to get one of them and 2 seconds to realize why they are free. n n My wife decided to stay away from the buffet and ordered a salad. Her salad promised ""mixed greens and candied pecans "". It arrived and the lettuce was white, pure white, not a leaf of green. Just the nastiest parts of a bag of iceberg lettuce. The only thing eatable in the salad was the chicken. n n When our waitress finally returned to our table, we only saw her when she took our order and my water glass sat empty for a good 40 minutes, I told her the salad was disgusting. She took it off the bill, which made me happy but honestly if she hadn't offered to I would had demanded it to be taken off because there is no way we are paying for garbage. n n Stay away from this place and don't make the same mistake we did. There MUST be far better options in the area.",1
"I love all Chipotles and this location is no exception. Best fast casual out there. n nNo surprises here, you will receive the same burrito, bowl or tacos you love and expect.

I researched this club first and found it was the only hip hop club on the strip so you know that was a go ! I was told to get there b4 1100 to get in free but I had tickets to KA and it let out at 1130 and that at the MGM . So we did'nt make it until 12 or so . The cover then was 20 for girls and 30 for guys and now a wait maybe 40 min os so but Finally we got in during the day it serves as a restaurant so the decor was nice and the music was banging and the crowd was in party mood ! I did not get a table but we were able to cop a bench by the bar in the back also chatted and partying the night up with my new found buddies from L.A If you like hip hop and sexy mama's and fella GO !,2
Probably one of my favorite Target stores around town. Mainly because it's fairly new and always clean. Other stores tend to be messy and just look run down. It is a tad difficult to locate an associate when you need help especially at the food court. Buying a bag of popcorn for my kids usually buys me an extra 20 minutes of shopping. The family bathrooms are a plus. I just wish they would refill the sanitizing wipes for the shopping carts more often. It always seems to be empty when I'm there. Also the staff the Starbucks are always friendly helpful.,2
"There needs to be an option for a half a star. Or no star. Called on my way home from work to order a pizza to pick up. Got to the front counter before anyone had answered the phone yet it was on automated pick up for 4 minutes when I got there the phone was ringing so I hung up my phone so it would stop ringing. The lady working came up to the counter and I told her I've been waiting for someone to pick up the phone for 4 minutes. She told me the phone never rang. REALLY? And as I'm sitting in the waiting area waiting for my pizza I for some reason decided to still order, the guy making the pizzas is cussing up a storm. What a great experience!",1

"We stayed in the casino for about 40 minutes 20 minutes longer than we wanted to. When I tried to cash out at the penny slot I was wasting money on, the machine refused to print my ticket. My boyfriend, at the slot machine next to mine, was able to print his, but no other machine, including the cash dispenser, would accept it again. After pressing the attendant call button and flagging down a cocktail waitress, eventually a nice old man came and apologized, and handed me my cash right away. n nI'm giving it two stars instead of one because on the way out, we saw a sign explaining that they were experiencing network issues with the slot machines, so I appreciate their candidness. Unfortunately, there are probably 20 entrances to the casino, and there was no such sign on the one through which we entered.",1
This is what my wife and I call a yelp bomb. Which is that yelp says it's amazing but in reality it is below average. I love chicken fried steak and get it at almost every chance i can for breakfast. So no surprise here that is what I ordered. It looked amazing and seemed like it was going to be delicious but unfortunately it didn't taste nearly as good as it looked. First the gravy was starchy and lacked flavor. Then the steak was too thick and tough for my liking and it also lacked flavor. I kept taking the next bit hoping it would be better but it wasn't. Needless to say I will never go back to this place again. My wife got an omelet and it looked pretty good but she was also disappointed. Their French toast looked good so if you go maybe try that. If you want a great breakfast head down the street to Egg and I. Much better food!,1
"Real surprise. Nice informal place. Good staff. Good food. Fair prices. The winning dish was the Tuesday night special fried chicken. Burger was the runner up. n nWill be back for sure. Oh yea,street parking. n nNice find for casual dining.",2

The food is expensive. .no other way to put it, but my 17 dollar lasagna while not a large portion was very good! Do yourself a favor and order a plate of fries.

"Paid 35 includes my food order, 5 delivery fee from Eat 24 hours, tax, tip for a mediocre, barely warm 11.99 medium Mama Mia pizza with ""canned "" mushrooms, 7.99 wings that were small and dry, and 2.99 side salad with just lettuce and a few tomatoes. Way overpriced and not very good.",1
"We checked out this place because we heard about their bottomless margaritas, and my wife was in the mood to get her margarita on. We were very optimistic, but were ultimately disappointed in our visit. n nDrinks The margaritas were fine, but the refills on them were VERY slow to come. This was a Sunday night, and not very busy, so I was disappointed at this. n n nFood We ordered a queso fundido for an appetizer. It was fine, but not as ""dip py "" as I was expecting I was hoping for more of a cheese dip, not just melted cheese, which quickly congealed, and was hard to get on the chips after five minutes. I ordered fajitas, and they were pretty tasty, standard, no complaints. My wife ordered a chimichanga, one of her Mexican favorites, and was very disappointed to find it not at all crunchy crispy, but more soggy. Very disappointing. n nOverall Service Aside from the margarita slow down, the rest of the service was also very slow timing of courses lagged, and for a slow night, the food came out very slow. Most Mexican places we've been to are MUCH faster. The water lady was VERY prompt, and came by many times, and that was great. My wife drinks VERY fast, and we rarely had an empty water glass. It's too bad that lady wasn't in charge of refilling margaritas. n nWe would give the food 2.5 stars, and the service 2 stars. The price isn't that great for a Mexican place off strip in Vegas, and there are a lot more authentic places with reasonable prices and better service.",1

"I need to start by saying that I am NOT the type of person that gets a manicure or even goes to a spa. The reason I went today is that I needed a pro to fix my cuticles before my wedding. n n That being said, I enjoyed my time here. I went for a regular manicure. Overall, I enjoyed the process and was relaxed, but a few things would keep me from returning soon 1 My tech was funny and easy to talk to, but I was a bit skeeved by the fact that she blew big bubbles with her gum while clipping my cuticles. 2 They had a limited choice of polish colors. I usually paint mine something crazy neon pink, black, obnoxious glitter and the various shades of red and pink weren't to my liking. The meadow green I picked was the loudest color there and while it's cute, I'd like something weirder. All in all, I'll definitely go back in the winter when my skin and nails are particularly awful.",2
"I was only here for the '5 at 5' or the '5 After 5' or whatever it is so I dont have the full BLT experience. The '5 at 5' is for the bar area only where you can order off a list of 5 apps for 5 a piece. n nI was here last night and the in love with himself bartender told us about their 5 drink specials. Most thrilling was the 5 BUD LIGHT SPECIAL this is not a misprint . And he actually had no comeback to my subsequent observation that a BUD LIGHT ON NO PLANET IS SPECIAL LET ALONE FOR FIVE DOLLARS. FYI if you go into the bar and pick up the menu, you will see this super 5 Bud Light is available daily.I can't understand why people arent FLOCKING to the bar to take advantage of such a deal. n nAnyways the food we ordered the beef sliders and the crab cakes. The crab cakes were fantastic and worth the shitty service but the beef sliders were odd. When you first see them you are like 'WOW' cause two come out per order and they are huge! Then you realize instead of a ground sirloin patty, it comes out with a slice of tenderloin on it. So did you ever try to bite into a slice of tenderloin on a sandwich? Being that I am not a barracuda my teeth were not sharp enough to bite through it. So a gross scene ensued where I am trying to severe off a piece by ripping it with my hands and teeth NOT SEXY. I had to eat the rest with knife and fork.maybe a 'lady' would have started this way but hey I am honest. Anyways the bar filled up later and was fun. I hope to return sometime for a full meal to properly judge the place and I hope to add more stars ",1
"I recently stayed here for 9 nights. Not necessarily a place for a long stay but overall was a great experience. The desk staff made my stay worth the while. They were informative and helpful. The true definition of hospitality. They have a great, fully stocked bar with great music playing at night. I didn't get to use the pool but if I had a bathing suit it would have been a great way to relax. nThis is a very cool, modern concept from W Hotels. They have a food pantry which is pretty well stocked with salads, sandwiches, snacks and a variety of cold beverages. They serve a continental breakfast every day which is reasonably priced. They also serve light snacks at the bar at night but I wish they served some more substantial selections. Theres not a lot in the way of restaurants in the area because it is just outside the airport. nI saw some other yelp comments about wear and tear on the rooms but this was not the case for me. The rooms are well appointed and again modern. The furnishings are a bit sparse but this is not meant to be a luxury concept. I nI liked the Bliss spa products which were a few notches above the usual soaps and creams you find in hotel rooms. nParking cost 10 per night and for the fact that they even charge for parking there were nights when it was difficult to find a spot.",2
"We got to vegas early so we hit up this spot for breakfast. Their crispy French toast is so yummy. It's covered in corn flakes and tastes like a churro. Heavenly! n nUnfortunately, they don't serve nachos until 11am and that was the main reason we went there to eat.so we came back later that afternoon and ordered the nachos that we were told were so amazing. n n3 plates of nachos and two plates of chili cheese fries. In all honesty, I enjoyed the chili cheese fries more than I did the nachos. I found that the tortilla chips were too salty. n nAnd a word of advice, come hungry or plan to share those plates with friends because they're HUGE! n nGood service, fun atmosphere, food that's pretty good. 4 stars.",2
Had a nice gluten free menu. Ordered the rootbeer and ginger ale which were tasty but lost flavor after first drink. Ordered the peanut stew over chili rice which was a mushy and more or less flavorless dish served over what appeared to be a zatarain rice. Also had the blackened mango mahi mahi with garlic mash potatoes. Blackened seasoning was tasty but fish didn't have much flavor. Garlic potatoes were the best part of the dish,1
"We'll start by saying the food was great, well above average coming from some food snobs , but read the rest of the review to see why they only deserve 2 stars. if that. n nAs others have said, the service was horrendous. We walked in and sat at the bar, and they acted as though we were interrupting them. As soon as we sat down, one of the waiters proceeded to restock the condiments right next to us, so close we almost bumped elbows. Then the fun began. The waiter with the shaggy light brown hair, gauged earrings, and beard was by far the most offensive employee I've ever encountered. n nRegardless of appearance, he was flat out rude. He was blowing his e cig at us the entire time while jotting down notes CONSTANTLY, to what I am sure will be the next New York Times best seller. disregarding his work to be done, of course. As though he wasn't offensive enough at that point, he slammed down a bucket of silverware next to us, in the middle of the bar with paying customers on both sides, and proceeded to wipe down the utensils with his unwashed hands. because I'm sure there was no better place to do that. nThis guys was also the one serving food to the table. no hand washing. and chain smoking his vapor cig as though it were a race to the cancer finish line, which he was clearly winning. n nI sincerely hope the business owner reads this because the food is really exceptional, but the service, the previously referenced employee in particular, will almost single handedly steer us away in the future. It's an absolute shame to trump such a culinary gift.",1
"I can't say enough about this place. I love to get lunch there, and leave with stuff to go. They have some incredible home made olives with different spices. I am an olive snob and can't say enough about them. You can also get hummus and baba ghanooj to go, as well as their freshly made they are a bakery pitas. They also have some interesting mixes, canned beans, etc. They have a lot of Sadaf products which is cool because I used to actually mail order from them once in a while! n nOn the lunch side, I love all their vegetarian food and often get a vegetarian platter or falafel sandwich or plate, etc. Their tabouli is out of this world good lots of fresh mint and parsley, lemon juice, it's perfect if you are into the Lebanese taste. I've never ordered meat there but I've seen other people order it and it looked great. The food is delicious and home made tasting. Their baklava is superb. Split some with your lunch mate. n nIf I were to succinctly describe their food it is fresh, healthy, authentic, and delicious. n nI gave it 5 stars. Not 5 stars like a fine dining type restaurant 5 stars because they do their type of ethnic food with unfailing perfection and authenticity and consistency across multiple visits. n nMiddle Eastern Bakery is keepin it REAL yo! blatant fishing for cool ratings!

Would I rather munch in Denny's, IHOP, Village Inn, Coco's, or Marie Callender's? Nope. They don't have a clubby atmosphere full of jazz and music art. They don't have big screen flat panels with the topic of the moment quietly providing information and entertainment. They are places where your money, after salaries and operating expenses flows to remote corporate centers, and if they are lucky, the pockets of stock holders. Dang, I just criticized my IRA. Wall Street forgive me for I have sinned. n nIf you like national consistency in menu, dependable look, and style, 5th Avenue is not for you.

"If you ever feel the need for ill prepared food in a funeral home esque atmosphere, this place is for you. The last time I was here it was when a visiting scholar was in town, so someone got the bright idea of bringing her here.

"I was really excited to try this place as I wanted a natural drink and lunch.

I went to take a seat and saw how several to people who were treated very friendly like regulars come in order and leave. I waited so long and finally asked the guy who took my order if he knew anything about my drink order. Turns out her forgot and asked me for my drink order again. So he charged me but didn't put in the order. I was so hungry, thirsty but didn't say anything. He called me to get my drink. I drank it went back to my table and after waiting for 25 total got my food which I had to drink with water since the juice was drank way before that.

I stuffed myself.to an inappropriate level. Each piece of fish is perfectly crisp and fried. The oil is fresh so the fish is always light and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

"I kept hearing about this establishment as a great breakfast spot, and didn't want to go to a watered down version of it with locations located throughout various casinos on the strip. So, we opted for the one about 6 miles off the strip. Don't let the drive to it scare ya, as it's lined with a lot of vacant businesses. You will reach the location as it's across a CarMax and it's next to some Vampire themed club no, I'm not joking . n nWe got here around 8 30am Saturday and the place was pretty vacant. We took the tip from others stating to get here before 10am. Loved the mellow ambiance of the place and the staff was super friendly and got seated with our menus asap. n nTheir menu was no joke and goes way beyond the standard breakfast options. Some things made myself and the hubby go ooo and ahhh, but since we didn't want to try anything too crazy as we were heading to Utah for an long day of being outdoors, we opted for something that would sustain us for a long day ahead. I opted for the original HH benedicts while the hubby got the Tractor Driver combo. We looked around the other tables with the huge portions, so we knew what to expect. nHere's the breakdown n nOriginal HH benedict Crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin w market yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream and topped w scrambled eggs, oh, and this in top of a huge biscuit and mashed potatoes! Holy moly, when they brought it out, it was like a diorama of the Red Rock canyon, with a sprig of rosemary as a miniature tree on top of the mountains! I swear, cutting into it was cutting through 5 6 layers of food! One bite and man oh man.so gooooooood! The BBQ cream gave it a different flavor because I'm a hollandaise type of gal, but it worked for this dish! Seriously, 2 people could have split this entree, but I got through about 75 on my own hey, needed the carbs for the hiking! . Definite try if you're an eggs benedict person like me. n nAs for the Tractor Driver combo, it was a borderline pothole sized pancake with eggs and bacon. The hubby can eat pancakes, but even he only ate about 1 2 of the pancake in order to eat the eggs and bacon as well. Goodness! n nSo yea.the portions here flat out represents why people think people in America are fatties. And if an episode of ""Man vs. Food "" had to prove how ginormous their portions are.yea, come here with an appetite. n nI won't lie.I secretly would like to return to try to chicken and waffles breakfast I saw others eating at the place, but again, will have to share that monstrocity with someone because I may get a heart attack if I ate it myself. n nPrices justify the portions and the taste. Yea, get here early! It's legit",2
"We decided to try this place yesterday for the first time since we were craving Asian food so we ordered take out. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with friend rice and the California roll sushi which was about 13. The fried rice came with shrimp sauce and that seemed to be too runny. Also the teriyaki chicken seemed to be too under seasoned and fried to death too dry . The rice was mediocre and sticking together. The sushi arrived hot, the avocado in it tasted old and so did the crab meat. There was no flavor in the sushi whatsoever. I was very disappointed. My boyfriend took his meal in a to go box as well and when he tried to reheat it later it smelled horrible. I suggest that if you want some delicious Japanese food then skip this location. Pay some more money and get better quality food elsewhere. I'm very disappointed at this location and I wish I could give them less than one star. Even an Asian buffet can do better than this.",1

I was still given additional forms to fill out, the front desk receptionist told me not all the forms are available on the website. I politely mentioned someone should update the website. I proceeded to fill out the forms. The forms I completed from the website were the typical personal and medical history. However, the additional forms I was asked to complete were a bit strange. The first was a form on varicose and spider veins family history and symptoms I may be experiencing , the second was a prescription policy stating they will not call in or fax prescription requests to the pharmacy, you must pick up the written request. Lastly, was a doctor patient arbitration agreement. I have NEVER had to fill out a form like this at any doctors office I have visited. At this point I was questioning this medical practice and their doctors. I found this to be unsettling. n nAfter waiting for 50 minutes in the waiting room. I watched 3 people go into the back office before me and they arrived after me. I was finally called back. I walked through the door to the back office, I was directed to a small corner to have my vitals checked. This was not a closed space or room, I was out in the open, other patients and staff were walking past me. After that I was escorted to a private room. I will say that the medical assistant was very friendly. Then the doctor came into the room, she never introduced herself. Luckily I knew who I was seeing Dr. Finley and she was very nice and answered all of my questions pertaining to the vaccines. n nI will not go back to this office and will not recommend it to my friends and family.",1
"I had high expectations for this place, what with Thomas Keller's reputation and the gaudy yelp standing and the circuitous route to get to the spot and my love of brunch. n nWe left disappointed. The service was awful. My theory behind th bad service stems from the preponderance of European and foreign folk that seemed to fill every table. Euro's don't tip. The wait staff surely gave up trying to earn their tips through stellar service long ago. n nThat attitude is unfortunate because I am a fat tipper and our server ignored us and rolled her eyes at us and otherwise undermined our meal. n nThe pastries were all stale. n nThe entrees came out one at a time over the course of 15 minutes. n nI had to ask 3 times where my sticky pecan roll was. When I finally got it it was dried out and uninspired. n nSauteed spinach that came with one of the dishes was unseasoned, inedible, and unnecessary. n nI had the croque madame which was really good. All of the entrees were great, actually, but the combination of awful service and stale pastries left me with a bad taste in my mouth.",1
Had a positive experience here adopting a dog. I checked out the website ahead of time and I brought my current dog with me when I went to see how she would get along with the potential picks. They let me walk through and pick a few dogs to bring outside and interact with. I chose a dog that seemed impartial to my own and asked what the policy was if it did not work out. They reassured me that if they did not take to each other I could switch her out for another dog. She settled in really well was already potty trained and all around more well mannered then my other dog!,2
Being a bakers daughter.I know cupcakes! I LOVE LOVE them but Iam a harsh critic.the store itself is cute and the girls who own it are sweet and LOCAL.huge plus in their favor. The cupcakes are pretty but pretty doesnt make my tummy happy.

"The menu at Le Provencal needs a Gordon Ramsey intervention. n nBelieve what other people are saying about this restaurant. n nI ordered the mushroom risotto and it tasted like bland mush. As a result I only ended up eating half of my meal. n nA couple of the servers turned on the microphones and sang a few songs which was cheesy and it they were way too loud in this small restaurant. We couldn't hear each other when we spoke. n nFor Paris Casino, this is a pitiful excuse for a restaurant. n nThey have an excellent but overpriced bakery next door which is well worth checking out. n nIf you have time to plan in advance, book a table at Mon Am Gabi instead. You won't be disappointed. Expect good quality food and slightly higher prices but overall you will be rewarded with a very good dining experience.",1

"Sandbar is an OK place to go in the daytime when you are having a few drinks, but at night this place gets crazy which isn't always bad, crazy can be fun .but not always in a good way. We come here because its close to home and we enjoy the ambiance, but the food is not very good at all. One Friday night we decided to go to Sandbar to have a few drinks and relax, and all of the sudden my foot is bleeding everywhere. There is some crazy girl throwing bottles and drinks at some guy she is pissed off at, and my friends and I have glass all over us and are drenched with sticky alcohol.I go to the bouncer to let him know the situation and that people are getting hurt by this psycho b h and what does he do? He kicks me out! I try to explain the situation to him but his little bouncer brain doesn't quite get the picture. They never did anything about the girl and my friends and I had to leave. This place is trashy.end of story.",1
"We came here as a group of ten for a mini get a way vacation. We weren't looking for anything lavish, but a place where there was enough to do for the kids aside from Circus circus . I think we found the place. n The hotel itself smells like a casino cigarette smoke .not very good ventilation. The floors where the rooms are, on the other hand, smell completely better and smoke free. Aside from that, we enjoyed many things about this place. We took the kids to watch a movie in the theater located on site, took them bowling, which was also located on site, and even the arcade was decent also on site . We would have made more use of the pool, but it was super windy so they closed the pool down. Oh and FYI the pool is salted! n Overall it was a great inexpensive stay. They give you two coupon books upon check in and mind you, you can use them all at the hotel! Pretty good deals.",2

"Wow, talk about the Aloha spirit. Traveling through on business. First time in LV and haven't had Local food in almost 3 years due to our family being stationed in Europe. Driving to Nellis AFB and happened on this gem of a restaurant. Let me tell you the food was awesome and the Aloha spirit was truly exceptional. Although I haven't been able to go home to Hawaii in a while, I truly felt the spirit of Aloha through the food and hospitality of the locals that own and work in this wonderful establishment. n nMahalo 808 for making my first time in LV a tasteful one. BTW the poi, garlic chicken, and kalbi was AWESOME! See you guys again when I pass through LV.",2
"I've been enjoying this place for well over 10 years now, and it's worth the trip to the NE side of the valley for fantastic food, great prices, and family friendly service from the same people who've been serving me and my family for years.we've watched the place grow from a tiny two tables with a kitchen to expanding with the bakery next door and more tables.the personal touch of being able to ask if they have a special of the day that isn't on the menu is always a treat and good for a smile from the gentle giant who always serves us.ask about less Americanized dishes if you're brave enough for authentic, and you'll be pleasantly surprised by what they can and will make for you! The warm crisp tortillas rather than chips and salsa are a treat, and you get WAY more than you'd expect for portions.I've eaten at many ""Mexican Restaurant "" establishments in Vegas, and this one is the one I keep going back to and take family guests to as well.",2
"I've been going to the Orleans for years. The casino is more of a ""locals "" casino who has a history of taking care of their players. I don't consider myself a hardcore gambler but I do play enough for them to hook me up with rooms and food. That alone keeps me coming to the Orleans and ""donate "" to their cause. The casino is clean and provides good food and service. The only bad part is that it is not on the strip. If you are looking for the ""strip "" experience, this is not the place to be. This place caters more to the local crowd and the moderate gambler who enjoys freebies. n nWe checked oujt the pool Saturday afternoon. The hotel offers a wading pool and the main pool. I think there is a spa as well but we didn't quite make it there. The bar and the pool was quite enough. The bar at the pool offers bucket specials which is perfect pooliside. There is also a DJ playing great music. n nThey offer cabana service and plenty of reclining pool ""bed chair. "" The only complaint I have is that they don't have waitresses offering cocktail services around the pool for lazy people on vacation like me. Other than that, good times!",2
"Worst service experience ever! Been there 4 times and every time there were issues. One time for a simple oil change and they didn't tighten the oil plug and oil leaked all over. Took it back to have them look at it, they said they fixed it, and it still leaked so had to take it back again. Now most recently waited a week to get a service appointment. Just needed the brakes looked at and 4.5 hours later they hadn't even looked at it yet! They kept my Jeep overnight and didn't call me to confirm. I called at 11AM the next day and they still hadn't looked at it yet. Totally ridiculous, never going back.",1
"This place is not bankrupt anymore. They are open for business although I don't know how or why. The food is terrible, and I mean Really terrible. The bar is ok but mostly the typical local bar huggers. I didn't try any mixed drinks so I don't know if they can make a drink or not, but they sure can't cook.",1
"If I could, the rating would be 4 and 1 2 stars. The food and the service was great. n nA friend of ours told us about the Paradise Valley Burger Company. I honestly thought that 2 Hippies was still there even though PVBC has been there since June or so . We went at 7pm on a Saturday and were the only ones there but from what I understand, they do a pretty brisk lunch business. n nWhen he hasn't eaten somewhere, my husband always asks the employees what he should order. The guy behind the counter said without a doubt the Brulee Burger. Being a boring burger gal, I got a plain cheeseburger. We also got the sweet potato tots, chips and he got a milkshake. n nThe burgers were excellent. The buns were fluffy and so delicious! The brulee burger was so flavorful. and at 6.50, the prices were very reasonable. We both were very pleasantly surprised. Truthfully, from the location, we weren't expecting the level of food we got. You could take the same food and serve it in Old Town Scottsdale for twice the price! n nWe are certainly going to go back and try more of their menu. I'm looking forward to the french toast fries and I think that the Country Fried burger is next for my husband. n nThe only negative would be the physical space. It is sparse and a bit kitchey. I feel there is a disconnect between the space and the food.",2

"Went here for the XTRA910 NFL Draft party on 4 25. Place is nice setup. Lots of beers on tap. Service or at least the server we had was horrible. After 5 minutes of waiting for the server to come up, I placed my order for a coors light. waited 15 minutes, then the server came back saying my beer must of been delivered to the wrong table, asked what I wanted and then I waited another 15 minutes before getting my first beer. Happy hour price of 3.50 for a pint of Coors Light is not the best, but ok. We decided we wanted a round of shots and we were promptly told that they can't do that. What a great drinking establishment. No shots if you have beers. Well who the hell wants to wait 30 minutes between a beer and a shot, not me. Very disappointed with the service. I really hope our server was having a horrible day because she was awful.",1

I ate here one time and the meal was amazing. Has been awhile so plan on going back soon and then maybe I can give a better and more thorough review.,2
"We tried Red White and Blue one night before we went out. We had a late dinner around 930 and it seemed like a good place because it was still open and it seemed like it would be fast. We had a group of 12 girls and we figured it was the best place to go on a Thursday night bc we didn't have any reservations. When we got there, we told the waiter that we needed to be in and out in an hour. He said that if that was the case, no one order steak. What place needs to cook and serve and eat a steak in over an hour? Anyway, the menu seemed interesting and there were some good looking items on there. I tried the lobster cobb salad and I was very happy with it. The portions are really big and can be shared. I shared the salad with one of my friends and we each got a soup side and it was more than enough. Everyone else seemed content with their food. The service was ok. Like I said when we told the server we needed to be in and out in an hour you'd think we asked him to walk on water. It was 930 at night and there was only total 6 other guests dining in the restaurant. Shouldn't be that difficult. Then the kicker was at the end when we asked if he could split the checks for us. We didn't think it would be an issue bc we had it done in most of the restaurants at that point, but he made a big deal about it saying that he thought we needed to be out in an hour and splitting the checks would take a long time. In the end he agreed, and he split the checks for us 8 checks for 12 girls. LOL, we figured it out, but it was one of the more interesting dinners we had in LV. I don't know if I'd go back, maybe if I stayed in Mandalay Bay again and wanted something quick they also have a to go counter .",1

"I wrote this review while eating at the restaurant on my phone just in case i forgot the details of how bad the food was. perhaps it was just us failed at ordering and we shouldn't have listened to the waiter because whatever the waiter recommended was NOT good at all. The fish and chips were 20 dollars and it's not on the menu. The french fries tasted like deep fried oilly potato skins and the fish was pan fried without seasoning very plain.and I don't think its fresh either . the Cobb salad has a weird taste that gave me a bad after taste ew.hate it so much . So I couldn't help but to stare at everyone else's food surrounding our table and wondering what an epic fail that we picked the worst dishes on the menu and off the menu. . So the bill came out to be 53 dollars for fish chips cobb salad 2 coffee. n nAnyways, the only comforting thing was that the host and another waiter were very friendly and helped us to get situated at a better table than the original one that we were suppose to be seated at. n nSo overall, please do not order Cobb salad and fish chips. Because you really don't want to waste your money on those two seriously not delicious I am trying hard not to use the word that starts with the letter D. dishes.and I have to say its not only the worst restaurant I have been to in Vegas, but the worst food experience I have ever had and i'm NOT exaggerating nService 4 stars nFood ZERO star if that was an option n nHere is a picture of how those two dishes look like. they look okay but tast D G. nhttp www.yelp.com user local photos?select z3izxU7Eckk67LFAP1pTVg userid S8lmPHaZK1RoSc5gtaZtWw",1
"I don't know where to begin. The owner of KB Mobile, Kenny, is a repair guru! I discovered him years ago when I was still in graduate school and still driving my clunky 'ole Mercury Cougar. That car had so many issues.and towards the end of its life, the issues were getting costly. Not only that, but the dealership as well as the other shops I visited in town were not getting things quite right. For example, I paid over 1,500 to have something in the engine fixed, and then a month later, the same problem surfaced again. The dealership quoted me ANOTHER 1,500 to have the same issue in the engine fixed. I refused to pay it, and I began my search for someone to get to the bottom of the problem. n nI found Kenny through a friend and gave him a call. He showed up at my doorstep with a huge smile on his face and an amazing, trustworthy energy. Hey, I'm a clueless young female he could have told me, ""Yea, the dealership is right, but I'll only charge you 900, "" and I would have gone with it. But Kenny did not simply use the dealership's diagnosis. He took the time to 1 accurately diagnose the problem on his own, 2 give me a step by step break down of what he was going to do to fix it, and 3 save me loads of money on the repairs. I think I paid around 400. n nI kept Kenny on as my trusted mechanic for the rest of my Cougar's life. I had that car 12 years until the transmission quit! Now I have an Audi hooray! , which Kenny knows tons about and he has officially completed its first repair. I won't go into details, but the bottom line is this n n Kenny is 100 trustworthy n He is 100 brilliant when it comes to repairs on both budget and luxury vehicles n He is 100 professional n nReally, I can't recommend this man enough. n nLet me end with an analogy. let's pretend you are dying of some strange, unnamed disease morbid, I know and you visit the Mayo Clinic, and the local hospital, and the alternative holistic dude at the juice bar. but none of them is able to help cure your illness. In fact, some of them even prescribe medicines and surgeries that you pay loads of money for, but that do nothing for you. Just when you think you are dead for good, you find Dr. Kenny. He shows up at your house, opens up his black bag, runs a few tests on you, and immediately knows exactly what your illness is and exactly how to fix it. and he does. The end. ",2
You have to love this store. I came to look at rope and other items that make you go hmmm she went to LOWES for that? Nevertheless I entered happy and left happy. You can get anything here from power tools to patio items.

I'm in heaven when I'm in this store. I may very well apply to work here.,2
"My husband and I were catching a show at the Smith Center and didn't have time for a nice sit down lunch so we decided to mix it up and try out Viva. When you walk in you are transported to another country. The interior is orange and yellow with Spanish music on the radio. The man behind the counter is cordial but definitely gets down to business. I ordered the pork butt and my husband ordered the shredded beef. We decided to share an order of fried plantains and a mango drink. We chose a booth and waited for our number to be called. They were quick and everything is served on a tray with 2 squeeze bottles of condiments on the side. The Arepas were absolutely delicious! I loved the ""bun "" which is more like a thick and crumbly corn tortilla. It was delicate and delicious. The meat was melt in your mouth cooked to perfection. I even stole a few bites of my husband's and it was also absolutely perfect. The fried plantains were not my favorite, definitely going for the fries next time. The mango drink was not too sweet, but the perfect way to quench your thirst on a hot Vegas day. Overall, we loved the food and the price. We will definitely be back very soon!",2

I said I would wait and asked for a 5 day pass so I could try it out and see how busy it would be during the peak times. He gave me a pass and said he would call and let me know about the coupon.

I had the shrimp gumbo and first of all the whole gumbo was really dark brown and just tasted like pepper. There was no other flavor. No tomatoes, no okra, no celery, no onions, nothing. It was really not very good and based on the gumbo alone, I wouldn't bother returning to Landry's for anything. Landry's started out in Louisiana? Looks like they forgot what they were doing.",1
"Definitely of the best hotels I've stayed in. It is one of the best home bases you can ask for. If I didn't have this insane love for the Cosmopolitan, I would have no problem staying at the Palazzo every time I came to Vegas. n nEven for the lowest level suite at the hotel, it's pretty amazing. The bed area has these super luxurious beds with mood lighting and drapes. You can easily sit back because of the comfort padding and watch TV from there. There's a sunken living room area that has a large L shaped couch with a pullout bed if necessary , a coffee table, a small dining table, and a fax machine printer if I actually needed to use it . The curtains are remote controlled, so it negates figuring out how to close the blinds when you need to live like a vampire after clubbing the night before. Plus the windows are huge, perfect for a Strip view. The room is easily capable of fitting six people comfortably. n nThe bathroom is the one that you wish you had at home. Two sinks, a small flatscreen TV, a large bathtub, a separate glass shower, and a toilet with a separate door in case you have multiple occupants of the room that need to get ready at once . And for the ladies, yes, there is a makeup mirror. n nAs for the hotel, you just know you're dealing with another level of class as soon as you walk in. The opening corridor leads you to this massive statue and hey, Lavo is right there too! . Then once you walk into the casino, they kept the main walkway so wide that you could fit three elephants down it. And it made for easy access to our rooms was very welcome.just walk straight. It's seriously dumbproof. Also appreciate that the ventilation was squared away, because I'm sick of going into casinos where you end up smelling like smoke if you stay there too long. n nFood options are plentiful. You have Grand Lux Cafe, you have Palazzo's line of 2nd floor shops I really need to try to Sushi Samba , and because it's connected to Venetian you can go to the Grand Canal Shoppes' food court for cheaper options. n nBest part though? The Walgreens right next to it. I have no idea how Walgreens got prime territory on the Strip, but I am extremely appreciate of it. Especially when I needed some pick me up food in the morning. n nConsidering the price of the hotel on Labor Day Weekend and my experiences, I would have absolutely no hesitation staying here again.",2
"I've eaten at Zada Janes's many times. The experiences have run the gamut. Sometimes, there has been no wait at all, one time, my party waited over 30 minutes until we noticed people being seated who arrived after us. n nSometimes, the service is great sitting at the bar when Charlotte is working. Other times it's been slow and frustrating messing up orders, not reflling coffee, etc. n nThe food has been delicious on all but one occasion. n nAfter my first few visits, this was a favorite brunch place to take out of town visitors, but now seems too erratic to risk it. n nI've spoken to the owner about one of the bad experiences, while he was apologetic, things don't seem to have improved.",1
"After writing my review for Luv It's, it hit me I was going to be in Henderson for a Wine and Canvas class and of course I needed to make time for a stop. n nThis IS the best place in town for ice cream! n nFor this trip I just wanted to taste the yummy frozen custard so I got a plain jane double scoop vanilla cone, about 4. A little pricey but worth every penny. They have what they call concretes which are like blizzards but way better of course and those range up towards 6. The only down fall is is that there's only one location in town, Henderson AND the sign posted on their door today said that they are moving even further south on Eastern. OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION! n nI can't wait to have in again!",2
"Fun place to go. It was a nice date night. Definitely a lounge more than anything. A few lower seating and couches. Everything else is a hightop or at the bar. n nI saw people come in wearing t shirt and shorts and others wearing button up shirt with jeans.

"I went here for the first time a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed myself, as did my friend. The wait staff is friendly, attentive and made us feel welcome. We got the cheese board and had our waiter to choose for us, with a request for goat cheese from us. Then we tried the veggie salad and ended with the antipasto board. I know we gorged! But everything was delicious and attractively presented. We were also able to get a few glasses of wine during their happy hour, which is a good deal. n nThey have a nice selection of wines by the glass and some nice bottles. I would say that their bottle prices are a bit high, but honestly where are they not when you go to a wine bar, hell anywhere these days? That's why taking advantage of their happy hour is a good deal! n nWe ended up getting there early on a Friday, around 4 30pm and stayed until 7ish and had an excellent time. By 6pm there were a ton of people, so if you want a seat I would suggest getting there early if you can. This is a small place with limited seating but it's the small and cozy charm of The Living Room that won me over. I will definitely be coming back!",2

As so many yelpers pointed out before me, it is not like the NYC bagel at all. It is also on the sweeter side, maybe slightly too sweet for my taste for bagels, but still pretty good especially since we got them fresh out of the oven. I only tried the sesame bagels as I'm not a huge fan of the poppey seeds. My roommate got the smaller, harder sweet bagels and she liked them. Bottom line, not my favorite bagels ever, but definitely enough to satisfy my bagel craving and worth the drive. I will go back for more.",2
"Slightly Eastern European in mood and appearance. If I was a betting man, I would bet by the time you read this review that this location is closed.",1
"I don't like tapas. I especially don't like tapas when I'm with coworkers or clients it's awkward. You order shrimp but there's not enough for everyone. You order steak and someone's a vegetarian. You order soup and then feel guilty for eating the entire bowl yourself. n nI'm selfish. I want my food to myself. n nBut Jaleo changed all of that. n nSix of us ordered nearly everything off the menu and six of us wholeheartedly agreed not one thing was under par instead, every.single.morsel satiated every.single.taste bud. A restaurant has never been so consistently delicious so on top of their flavors and game that despite our full bellies, when two extra dishes arrived from the chef, we greedily scooped them up. Chicken and rabbit paella and the chef's new spin on an old standby garlic shrimp. n nWe tried the selection of cheeses and my comrades the three Spanish cured meats. We shared spoons in the garlic and grape soup a favorite amongst the table , we slurped oysters, severed mussels, crunched apple fennel walnut salad, forked fried eggplant and. more? Yes, much more. The cod and honey empanada that melted once breaking its delicate shell, the homemade potato chips drizzled with spicy tomato sauce, the out of this world garlic shrimp mentioned above and skirt steak that I can't comment on because I didn't have any . n nWe devoured every last bit not a crumb escaped our table. And when it came time for dessert? We split our waitress' two favorites with coffees and espressos. n nThis is the best restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating at in Vegas and one that I will return to again and again with clients, coworkers, friends or my partner.",2
"Without any doubt, this is my absolute favourite breakfast spot in the city! The quaint location and cozy atmosphere always leaves me feeling like a tourist. n nTheir unique menu makes it difficult to try something new when you're craving your favourites. But regardless of what you decide on, you won't be disappointed. n nTip Double check the opening hours before showing up. It'll be difficult to not satisfy that craving.",2
"I went to Haze a few weeks ago for a big night out and my night was completely ruined by the rude management. There were 7 of us 5 guys, 2 girls and we had booked a table a week in advance with an agreed 2 bottle minimum. At about 1300 anyone would consider this a serious expense and would expect to have an amazing evening and to get properly treated. The night started well. We were escorted promptly to a nice table with plenty of seating etc. Ordered 2 bottles of vodka. Atmosphere, venue and music are great. All is going well. Next came the 1st mistake I decided to close out to avoid carrying that much cash around with me for the whole night. Error. 5 minutes later we were approaches my a member of the hosting staff short, stocky guy with shaved head . if only I could remember his name I would be having serious words with the management. This guy was extremely rude and abrupt. He told us they were moving us to a better table closer to the dance floor because the owner was coming in and this was his preferred table. Ha ha. He then escorted us to a table that, I'm not joking, had seating for 1.5 people and the carpet felt like it had been treated with super glue. We complained that the table was not big enough for our group. His response was ""the table IS the same size "". well yes, the physical table surface area was the same, but please don't insult my intelligence after blatantly tricking us into moving. I don't appreciate being lied to, especially when slightly inebriated and after paying a 1300 bill. This nasty, rude little man ignored my pleas and walked off. Our new server agreed with me that the situation was ridiculous and I immediately requested to speak to another member of the hosting team. A new guy appeared, who to be fair, tried to correct the problem, but unfortunately the damage was already done and beyond proper repair. By this time all other descent tables with enough seating space were taken and we were moved for the 2nd time and taken to the 3rd level, in a corner, away from everything. If we'd just showed up on the night I might understand, but hang on, I'd made this reservation over week in advance. Although they did try to correct the problem, they by no means tried hard enough to appease their mistake. They could have given us a refund or a free bottle or anything really. but no. not a bean. Pathetic! It took me about an hour of barking complaints to various different people just to get my party moved to the 3rd table. By this time, I was so angry with the situation, that the evening was not salvageable. I thought about going to have words with ""said owner "" at our first table, but I ultimately decided that potentially getting kicked out would not make the problem better. I've had tables at many of the big clubs in Vegas including Tao, Pure, XS and Tryst and have been treated royally in all but this one. Very disappointing.",1
"Went here for Saturday morning brunch. I was very impressed by the quality of the meal. My friend and I ended up sharing Huevos Benedictos and Panqueques, which is a dulce de leche stuffed crepe. Both were delicious. Quite possibly one of the best benedicts I've had. I think my favorite part of brunch here though is the bottomless mimosas or bloody mary's caesar. It was a build your own bloody bar with choice of regular tomato juice or clamato. This was the only brunch restaurant I went to while in Montreal with the choice of a Bloody Mary instead of Caesar. My friend had the mimosa and they set up a bottle of champagne and carafe of OJ next to the table. Perfect spot for drunch ",2
"Oliver, the owner, is amazing! He was super helpful and friendly. As soon as I mentioned that I was vegan he talked to the chefs and had them make me a special sandwich. He stopped by my table twice to make sure it was good. Oliver and I talked about being vegan and I felt a much more personal connection as if I was a guest in his home as opposed to a customer. The sandwich was amazing but Oliver made my experience exceptional! He even offered me juice from his juicer, then came by and chatted more about what was in it and how it helps my body.",2
Best Tacos in Vegas! I love this place! I haven't been back to Robertos since I discovered El Gordo! The spicy pork tacos are theeeee best.seriously! Everything is made fresh right in front of you and the lines are always crazy. Its well worth the wait!,2
"I happen to live near this place and I only tried it for the first time 1 month ago. There is a wait time about 20 30 minutes usually. Cute decor feels retro. They offer free ""hot chocolate "" type shots to start which is nice. I ordered their yogurt and my husband has the grilled cheese with duck. I love my plate as well as their coffee. The grilled cheese lacked some cheese and only had duck in the middle and a small portion. Id go back to try different things. The staff is friendly. Still a decent breakfast place compared to a lot",2
"DON'T GET CENTURYLINK! GO WITH COX, period! n nThe trick about their internet is VDSL2 vs ADSL2. They only have VDSL2 ONLY! Terrible! n nThey try to sell me their modem which is 3 times more in price, and you can't get modem from Fry's Electronics to be compatible with CenturyLink. For example, I bought TP 8817 which is a ADSL2 and is twice as fast than VDSL2 and is even compatible with CenturyLink. I was not aware that I only had VDSL2. They keep telling me to buy their modem which I would never buy it from them, because they make a huge profit. n nThree times I had to talk to 800 technician to speed up the internet for the price I paid for. I had technician to come out to my house and told me that I need a new modem. He said he would give me a new modem. Later, he said I couldn't but I could buy it at Fry's for much cheaper. I did so and guess what. I couldn't use the Fry's modem that has ADSL2. Now the 800 technician told me that I have to buy their modem. This is a lame! n nI'm going to fight out of this contract and go with Cox. I will NEVER EVER go with CenturyLink. Spread the words around and don't want people to go through like me. n nStay with Cox for good! Trust me. I regretted that I use CenturyLink.

"I'm really surprised about the bad reviews service wise for this place! The people working there on New Years Eve were really nice and chatting with everyone. My family was stranded because the Strip was closed and we were unable to get to our hotel, so they told us to stay there as long as we needed until we were allowed back. They also had a lot of TV's around the restaurant and everyone was allowed to go outside to watch the fireworks from the Strip! n nThe service was a little bit slower than what I'm used to at a Vietnamese restaurant, but it wasn't overly long. The pho was pretty good, standard for a normal pho place. I got a jackfruit shake, and you could taste some jackfruit pieces. Yum! n nAlso a note They only offer pho and rice dishes after about 10pm or so. Don't expect spring rolls during the late night hours! Cash only as well with a small ish parking lot.",2
"Every time we're in Vegas we always stop here for breakfast. Their pancakes are fluffy and delicious! I've had the German pancake which is HUGE and covered with butter, lemon and dusted with powdered sugar. It hangs over the edge of the plate it's so big. Their omelets are really good also, from the ham and cheese to the mushroom and spinach covered with jack cheese. Crepes are perfect and go great with the potato pancakes with sour cream. Staff is like family, very friendly and welcoming. From what I remember they close at 2PM.",2
"God, I hate establishments like this. Why do I keep getting dragged to places like this, and when will our world finally move past such disheartening methods of existence? n n ",1
This place is ok. The food is decent besides the overpriced fajitas that had overcooked meat. The main issue is the terrible service. They argue with you on where you sit and had to ask my waitress to stop grabbing with the hostess to do her job. I am currently trying it again and the waitress is exceptionally impatient and seems to not want to be here at all. The only good experience has been the first time we came here and the manager was fantastic and so was the server. How that has seemed to change. The night crew here is terrible.,1
"Once I got over my shock that they didn't have chicken, I was ready to order! I picked the Mexican Shwarma as another Yelper called the pork . So glad I did. It was delicious. Not spicy I got the sauce on the side and very moist. The corn tortillas had the perfect corny tasty to them. I only wish I would have discovered this joint sooner. My wife waited on a different line and got the carne asada taco. She thought they were really tasty too. As good or better than a taco in Socal.",2
Huge beer lover and you can't go wrong with this place.but it's near ASU and the girls working are very attractive.,2
"This was difficult to rate. It is a very cool experience, however not romantic charming as it is VERY loud. It could have been so much better if the quality of food was even mediocre, but the food feel very short. How can you have such a great concept and serve crap for food? I guess the idea is to be affordable to get more folks to try but offer great food for us foodies and you would have won be over in every city where there is a location. Skip this experience and select a location for better food and a great view.",1
"I am currently living in Gilbert for a work assignment and have driven past this place numerous times. My curiosity finally got the better of me, so my husband and I went there last night to try it. n nI was delighted! They had a wonderful selection that satisfied both my vegetarian cravings and my husband's desire for meat. The food was prepared quickly and the portions were huge. I had the falafel with a side of rice and beans, and hubby had the chicken shwarma. n nThe falafel balls were crisp and tasty, and surprisingly light. Just the right amount of tahini sauce and vegetables. And they put pickles on it! Just like the Israeli places back home in NYC. n nThe chicken shwarma contained a very, very generous amount of chicken, and my husband says it was seasoned wonderfully. It had a little kick to it, too. n nOverall a great experience. We'll definitely be back.",2

"Check it. n nI generally loathe restaurants attached to a hotel. n nWith the exception of Cleo one of my favorite spots in LA inside The Redbury my favorite hotel in LA . n nI don't know what the deal is, but they always look like overstock dot com took a dump in the middle of the room metallic wall art, turquoise arm chairs, ultra modern textiles and the food is about as exciting as watching paint dry. I guess because it's in a hotel it needs to be bland enough to please everyone? n nIn any case, DSG follows in the footsteps of all the other places I've come across where you can slumber and snack. it's just not good. Not only were they out of 3 menu items one of them being olives. how do you screw up that order? but the things they did have weren't great. Cheese curds dripping with oil and flattened like little pancakes. Salumi that though I was told was prepared in house felt like chewing flavorless fat. The tuna wontons were fine. The parmesan fries also fine, but nothing about the experience blew any of us away. Service was awkward, less than informative and not very warm. n nI apologize to visitor's to Madison who may not make it out of the hotel to dine. This is not a good representation of what our city has to offer.",1
"This restaurant has been here forever and used to be one of my favorite spots.not anymore. Went last night for the 1st time in over a year The salad was warm and limp. Ordered clams as an appetizer. One bite of the ""fishiest "" tasting clams I have ever tasted told me that they had been frozen, which the waiter confirmed. Ordered the veal piccata, same thing! Frozen veal! Asked the waiter if anything on the menu was not frozen first and he recommended the shrimp. While the flavor was good, the plate was oily and the food greasy. The side of pasta bolognese was so watery that it had no flavor at all. The replacement side was over cooked and mushy. On the other hand.the waiter was fast, honest and courteous. I will not be returning.",1
"I've lived in the Bay Area for 10 years before I moved here in 1999. While living there I worked for a small Chinese Restuarant called Jade Palace of Newark. They have great food! Living here nearly 15 years, I have been trying to find good Chinese food. It became a mission. Then one day I walk into this establishment because my business is in the same plaza, I tried with the beef salad. Yes, I know that is Thai but, I loved that they gave more meat, and it was delicious. Then the BBQ pork won ton soup. Yum! Then the egg foo young! A must try.

That's when you know they don't care about the conditions the car is in. They're a total scam! It has been a horrible experience and a terrible nightmare the very first and last time I ever deal with them",1
"This place basically gets stars only because our waiter was the only guy who worked there who was super nice. Every one else who worked there were complete jerks. The food is super expensive, even with their happy hour pricing, and you don't get nearly enough to eat. Our group left making plans to go elsewhere to eat because everyone was still starving. nThe bathrooms there are super obnoxious. There are no signs, so I asked a waiter directions, and he merely told me, ""Yes, we have bathrooms, "" and promptly left. Nice guy. I chanced a random hallway and ended up in what I thought was the guys restroom, because there was a dude there washing his hands at the counter. No. You find a random closet to do your business, and everyone washes their hands together. Cozy. Except then you get to catch the waitresses who don't wash their hands. Oh yummy. nOur plates were dirty, there were flies everywhere. And it was disgustingly hot in there. nI suppose I should say something about the food. My buffalo chicken rolls were not bad I'm pregnant so I'm not allowed to eat real sushi , and the chicken fried rice tasted like it was made from a box. The others said their Cali rolls were super bland. nThere was one other waiter who was super nice too. I won't leave him out, so he'll make up the second star. But everyone else. Well, I can't blame them for hating their jobs I guess. Lol.",1
"While the staff is lovely, I contracted severe food poisoning here on the way to my grandfather's funeral. This was especially upsetting considering the ""99 "" inspection rating listed behind the restaurant's bar.in retrospect, it strikes me that the fish I had a tuna and salmon roll recommended by the waiter was not nearly cold enough. This is the first time in 48 hours I'm sitting up straight without an extreme headache caused by dehydration I hope to save others from a similar experience.",1
"What can I say, do you really need a Yelp review to read how sick this place is? Just 1 star, because I expect phenomenal service when I'm throwing down for bottle service tables! And the employees there get a bit sketchy about this.",2

"THIS PLACE IS THE ONLY PLACE I GO! SO AWESOME! n nI have been going to Pro Nails by Julie for about 4 months. I am a very loyal customer because I like to get the best mani pedi. every time. I had an old place I went to and I just couldn't take the inconsistency anymore. A friend thanks Whitney , recommended Pro Nails by Julie. It is so easy to get to, close to my house and not in a busy shopping center, so I can easily zip over after work. n nThey are open until 7 30 PM! And they will take clients up until the last minute but please remember. they have families too. n nTheir prices are affordable and I get gel manicures and their technique means two things 1 the gel lasts and 2 my natural nail isn't ruined. I get french gel a lot and that is complicated but theirs does last well. In general, french gel doesn't last as well as color or glitter glitter is like the roaches of nail color it never dies . but I like the french so I put up with that it may not last past two weeks. n nKim is one of my favorite technicians at Pro Nails by Julie. She really takes her time to give you a unique result. All the techs are great but I feel like it's a treat when Kim does my nails because it seems like she knows about all the cool trends in nails like designs, glitter and rhinestones. Definitely get rhinestones by the way. You'll thank me later. There are some up charges for these extras but they are worth it because you leave with a unique mani. n nAll of the techs do a fab and relaxing pedi. n nThe other thing that makes this place awesome for pedicures is that they put a new liner for EVERY CUSTOMER. I have never seen this done before unless you're at a super high end and super expensive salon. Here they do it and charge you the same that you'd pay for a dirty place. Pro Nails by Julie is clean, clean, clean. No toe nail fungus here gross! . n nGo to Pro Nails by Julie and go there often. You won't be disappointed by the prices, service, quality product or awesome staff. I highly highly recommend.

"It is basically ritual that I visit empanada man during the Saturday farmer's market. All my friends know this. This is what gets me out of bed on Saturday mornings. n nTheir empandas are amazing.

I could drink that sauce. probably not a good idea though n nMy favorites are the shredded beef and cheese. And the guava and cream cheese, beware that guava can be hot!

The owner is super nice and very interesting to talk to, has a cool story of where he is from and how the cart came to be.

"I lived most of my life in the area where the very first Trader Joe's opened up. It's still there in the same shopping center and it's about 4 times bigger than both locations in Las Vegas. The locations in Los Angeles County have extremely high amounts of traffic, yet somehow the workers are so well trained in providing excellent hospitality that they remember all the regular customers by name. That ain't happening here at the ""Summerlin "" location. 90 of the workers here probably can't even remember their own names. n nWhen I was shopping at the Monrovia location around this time last year, one of the workers was telling me a story about how he dropped by the Summerlin TJs location while vacationing at the nearby Red Rock Casino. He could not believe what he was seeing. Apparently, the behavior that the workers at the Summerlin location exhibit is rule breaking, and would get them fired if they worked at any of the Los Angeles locations. Also, he complained about how the workers don't watch where the f ck they are going and always collide with you. Holy sh!t.Isn't that what always f cking happens here? Have any of you guys ever been here and not had a worker collide headfirst into you? n nThe workers here seem confused, or maybe even hungover. When you ask simple questions about their products, they either do two things 1 They just don't answer you, and look down towards the floor. 2 They just don't answer you, and look towards the wall. n nIf you come after 7 30PM, almost everything is out of stock. There is no more whole grain bread, no more wheat tortillas, nothing. The only things they probably got left are products marked Cream of Duck, Pizza in a Cup, and prepackaged Seahorse Nigiri. n nMost the chicks who work cashier do nothing but gossip with each other, and they never pay attention to anything that is going on around them. They literally don't even say ""hi "" to the customers or even bother to tell you what your total price is. n nOrganic Toilet Paper? Are you f cking kidding me? Why does my toilet paper have to be organic? Tell that Joe motherf cker or whoever the f ck owns this place that I ain't gonna spend 5.00 on 4 rolls of toilet paper to wipe my ass ""Organically "". Are their really carcinogenic agents in my Wal Mart toilet paper that is gonna give me ass cancer? I don't think so. What a f cking scam! Nice try Joe. n nHemp Cereal? Can you imagine the douchebags who come in here and buy that sh!t thinking it's gonna get them high? What the f ck does hemp taste like anyway? I always assumed it tastes like smoking the wrong end of a cigarette or something. n nEvery time you ask a worker why they only have 2 Trader Joe locations in all of Las Vegas, they will always tell you ""We actually got 4. We got one in Green Valley, and one in Anthem "". You see, the fact that these workers don't know that Henderson and Las Vegas are two separate cities is probably the reason they also don't know how to answer basic questions about their own products. n nThey call this location ""TRADER JOE'S SUMMERLIN "". This location is not in Summerlin. Do you guys seriously not even know what area you live in? On a positive note, if this TJs was actually in Summerlin there would be even more bitter fat old people fighting each other, a bunch of Eastern European people wearing leather pants and skin tight metallic t shirts, and piss n sh!t all over the walls. n nIn all fairness, there is probably three workers here that are actually really helpful. 1st guys is the middle aged man who works behind that desk area, second would be the Filipino woman who frequently likes to talk about traditional Filipino cuisine, and 3rd would be that one dude from Pasadena. The other workers ain't that great. n nThe other reviews claim that this location gives ""good customer service "". Then what the f ck is going on here with me? I'll just assume they don't like Asian people or something. I don't know?",1

"Such great beer. After listening to my fellow Americans and many Europeans scoff at the best Canada has to offer on tap, this place was such a welcome change. n nThey had unique seasonal beers with creative names, things like Maple Cream and a Chocolate Stout with some winter theme y title. I got the Honey Brown Ale, and it was wonderful. My boyfriend's IPA was strong and bitter like an IPA should be. I wish I had tried more, although given my size that would have certainly ended badly for all involved. n nThey don't have poutine on the menu, but they do have regular fries, as well as guacamole and nachos, both with house made chips, that can satisfy that salty craving. The menu items are usually around 10 CA. n nWe had a little trouble finding a table big enough for our party and I do mean party , and the one we got was really close to the live band playing. very, very loudly. Well! But loudly. You had to shout to carry on a conversation with the one person sitting next to you, and too bad if anyone else wanted to be included.

"Went to Degree 270 Saturday night with a girlfriend around 9pm. The casino was packed. They treat this like a Vegas hotspot, complete with velvet rope line leading up to a counter where you tell them where you're going and get ID'd and a bracelet. They also have a dress code which seemed rarely enforced, considering all of the shorts, ripped jeans and flip flops we saw and a 10 cover charge for men on some nights. So we had high expectations. n nWhich quickly crashed when we entered. There are a few lounge areas, but there are also odd high top tables with linens like you'd find at a wedding. There were very few people, so the huge open areas just felt strange. The view was on 3 sides and great. Some people danced. It was too loud to be a place to lounge. n nThey're totally not a wine bar anymore just a dance club. When I asked the bartender for something girly but not too high calorie, he suggested a vodka and red bull. Or vodka and pineapple. Then just shrugged. See, there actually is a difference between a mixologist and a bartender! And as others have noted, they do serve drinks in totally tacky plastic glasses. I paid 8.50 for a vodka and tonic. n nIt was a really mixed group, in age and dress. We wouldn't go back.",1

"This place sucked beginning to end. Long wait at the door, ok. Solid 10 minutes before our order is taken, and, wait for it. 45 minutes for some burgers and fries. Double cheeseburger and chipotle burger were both totally overbooked and dried out.

"I can't believe I'm having to write this review as most of my encounters at this location have been nothing but pleasant. Well not today! I come in around 2pm to pick up a late lunch for myself and a co worker. Line is fine, no issues there. I order a burrito bowl to go with white rice and black beans. I know the drill. Then I get to the barbacoa. It's the bottom of the barrel only the fatty pieces left, so I say you know what, I'd rather wait for the next batch. She looks at me like I'm crazy. She's like what do you mean. Again, I'm like I'd rather wait for the next batch than get what's left. Now here's what pissed me off. She turns around and laughs and says something to the other dude in Spanish. Oh no she didn't. I should have left right then and there and I wish I had. n nLook, they're going to have to bring out a fresh batch for the next person anyway and I said I'm fine waiting. I don't get what the big deal was. Haven't any of you ever gone to a pizza place, saw the last dry slice all by itself and said you'd wait for a fresh pie? n nSo then she calls me over with some dry pieces that they brought from the back in a new bowl. Seriously? I'm not dumb chic. I'll wait for the next batch. As I'm waiting a couple minutes later another guy walks up and says the same thing and she's like, no problem it'll just be a couple minutes. Oh really? I see how this goes. I mean, come on. How hard was that? n nLike I said I've been here before, made small talk, joked around with the other staff and walked out with a smile.

Dark and clubby all the time. We stopped in there for a drink on a beautiful sunny day. It was very dark yes there are no windows and that's the way the place is but they could have raised the lights and made it more lively. n nWe decided to leave when we saw the bar was packed with people who thought they were at Tryst at 2am.,1
"HORRIBLE service! Do not go here if you value customer service. The manager pr owner not sure which one he was was very confrontational after we decided to leave and even followed us out with a smart ""have a great day ""! We just continued walking out and kept it classy. DO NOT GO HERE!",1
"Great drinks, great view. Disappointing service all around. What's with the patio servers and the non existent bar tender? Can not believe that a place like this does not welcome you when you sit down, offer you drinks and service the second you walk in.",1
Decor was a 10. Food was full flavored and each dish had many components. Menu was fun and interesting. Service was very attentive. We had a 9 00 reservation on Saturday night and the store was full. Very high energy dining room. We were seated right away. Margaritas were fresh and delicious. Maybe a tad sweet if I had to say anything bad. I guess they weren't too sweet cause I had 2. Desserts were good also. Pretty expensive but that's how big restaurants in Vegas roll now.,2

"I had the distinct pleasure of spending a weekend in Vegas with a bunch of guys who were a little more health conscious than the regular ""let's party like we're 21 even though we're not! "" crowd. I have never partied so well, had so much fun, and felt so good. A lot of it had to do with being pressured to stay totally hydrated so we wouldn't fade at 4am. A lot more had to do with just eating healthy, rather than pigging out on junk. n nOne of our meals was at j pop we were staying in the Mandalay, it was easy and convenient. We sat at the sushi bar, as it was easy for 8 guys to sit down, order for themselves, pay for themselves, and get rapid, attentive service. Which we did. n nI ordered mostly Nigiri. My bro ordered a roll I think. I also had green tea. The fish was good fresh and flavorful. The chefs made it promptly, and the presentation was excellent. I was hungry from hanging out on the Mandalay Bay Beach, body surfing in their wave pool, and talking to random people, so it was nice to get served up quickly. n nIt may have been a bit pricey, I don't remember, but seriously what now isn't pricey in LV? Hard to find good food for cheap anymore.",2
"The drudgery of the corporate Machine nSo basically at the Bellagio in the pit everyone hates upper management. They all are disgusted by the stupid policies the crappy treatment and the shitty benefits. The company made the worst mistake in the history of US construction. City Center and they are billions in debt but the upper echelon continues to pay themselves bonuses. The front line worker is just a cog in the big machine. They waste money, they cut a nickel and lose a dollar. It is so poorly managed that most of the old time customers long for the days of the mob run casinos. At least these guys knew how to treat people. They were neighborhood guys with big hearts looking to make a buck and feed their family. So they skimmed a little. So a few people got killed or beat up. What the current corporate structure does is loot the place at the expense of the shareholder. Jim Murren is the leader of a band of ivy league educated fools. guys who dont know the first thing about dealing with a pissed off cuatomer. The only thing they care about is preserving their job and bonus. Here is a good stock tip for ya. Short MGM it is behemoth that is going to crumble.destined to fail. The door will never shut because it is ""too big to close "" but it will be broken up and reorganized.

"I'm officially done purchasing LV products after today! I went in for a repair on a purse and was told that because it had a crack that they could not repair the strap, rendering my purse unusable. It also took several times to even get a semi logical explanation from the manager. Neither she nor the clerk was capable of explaining why it could not be repaired. The only logical response though would have been that they can try to repair it, but cannot guarantee the repair. Instead, I was told to take it to a local shoe repair shop. nDone! I encourage my friends, sorority sisters, family, etc., to be aware that LV does not stand behind their products. Select a different ""luxury "" bag.",1
"one of my go to cocktail spots in the biltmore area. this place has been here forever but somehow manages to still maintain that ""cool "" appeal. they have great cocktails and their weekend djs always play a good mix of songs. the darkly lit interior and low seating definitely help create a timeless feel when you're there. n nmy normal drink is a moscow mule, but the sweet little sixteen and the blackbird are tasty as well. they also have some upscale bar food if you're interested in snacking while you throw back your 4th old fashioned.",2
"Simply poor service. Went there for a drink, the place was pretty busy, so I sat at the bar. Ordered a beer and a buddy ordered some chips. We waited probably 10 minutes for the beers, chips never showed. I tried to pay one of the bartenders for the beer but he said he couldn't run the register. We had to wait another 10 minutes or so for the other bartender to pay for the drinks and left. Bad form, guys.",1
"This is our favorite donut shop! This place beats the big chains, hands down! Not to mention another local well known place. The breakfast sandwiches are good and the donuts are always fresh and delicious! The staff is always happy and courteous. I am happy to drive out if my way to get here. They do take debit and credit but only on purchases larger than 3, but who can blame them? They're a small shop that has to pay a fee. The only real draw back is they don't serve decaf coffee.",2
"I came to Tao again, during CES. I was with a group of 10, mostly men. I had a few work associates inside, who had a table. I told the bouncer we were with said group, and he said he'd be right with us. Proceed to wait 30 min. n nThe bouncer then says we had too many guys and we had to add 4 additional bottles to the group's table. They were fine with that. n nWait another 20 min. n nWe finally get in, and they put us in the most shittiest corner of the club. and the 15 or so of us are trying to make ourselves comfortable while trying to dance, converse, etc. n nWe ask the hostess if she can move us to the main dance floor, or something better to accommodate all of us. she says there is nothing she can do, even though we just dropped thousands of dollars. I won't be back.",1

"I have been craving crawfish since I dined here over Labor Day weekend. We were in Vegas for my sisters birthday and if you know anything about me and my sister is that we love food. Our trip was planned around where we would be eating the entire time. That's how we roll. n nWe came here on a Friday night and luckily got seated right away. We had heard of long long wait times so we planned on coming earlier than later. n nOnce seated, we looked at the menu and ordered up our meal. 4lbs of Hot and Juicy crawfish for my sister and me, oysters for me and the hubs and he and my brother in law ordered shrimp. n nAlthough the service was slow, the food was not. They were brought to us in plastic bags all steaming and full of flavor. The crawfish were ah mazing. They were so hot to the touch that I didn't care if my tongue got burnt. I could not get enough of them. The seasoning was addicting and wanted to have it on everything. The boys were done eating before sis and I even really got started. We can put a lot back. n nCome here. Don't walk. Run. Or drive since its off the strip. You will thank me. But just a warning, your clothes will smell like the food. It's that potent.",2
I have been a business customer when they were still Alltel. Josh and the whole staff have always taken care of me at this location.,2
"Yea they do have some of the best kimchi I have ever had in my life. for that it gets an extra star. as far as the food, I ordered the 2 which had the brisket, tripe, intestines, and tendon. and they don't skimp on any of it. it does come bland. it's up to you to season it however you like. salt, pepper, green onions, and spicy red paste us avail to you. I even threw in some kimchi. the first smell that hits you. It did remind me of the times when my mom made this soup. friendly staff, fast service. I might be back to try other things on the menu, mainly the kalgeuksoo, which was my childhood favorite.",2

Wrong food and then they re served part of the old plate and still got the eggs wrong. Manager did not even apologize and only comped one plate when two were done wrong. Will not go back. They do not want your business or have any respect for their customers.,1

"OMG, we have been coming to San Tan for years, and has always been a great place. We have brought friends and family knowing they would be taken care of. Today we showed up around 6 30 pm. I ordered my standard mojito, had to send it back once. They brought it back and it had no sweetness to it, I walked up to the bar, where a manager, Tim, asked me what was wrong, after telling him about my drink, he proceeded to tell me if I wanted it sweet, ""there is sugar at the table "" OMG, Really?!,! This is not the service I'm accustomed think getting here!",1
"Bought a dining certificate from Travelzoo 39 dinner 2 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. We called in advance to make a reservation for Friday at 7 o'clock it was totally unnecessary. The restaurant was only half full. n nWe were first seated in booth overlooking the mall, but I became nauseated from the overpowering scents wafting over from Lush. They moved us without any trouble. n nWe asked to substitute beer for wine, but no go. House wine was the only option. Two pinot grigios were brought over. It was really sharp, way too much acidity. n nWe started with the tuscan salad 10.95 Fresh spring mix, tossed with diced Roma tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, sliced red onion, basil, parsley and toasted chunks of herb ninfused bread. Finished with an aged balsamic vinaigrette. And garlic fries 6.95 . The salad was nicely dressed and fresh only complaint was the lack of mozzarella cheese. The fries were shoestring and crisp, but pretty average. The garlic aioli was heavy not a fan. n nNext we had the Margherita 18.95 pizza and the rigatoni with meatballs and bologonese 17.90 . With a name like Slice of Vegas I had to try the Pizza. I wish I hadn't. The rigatoni was far superior. The margherita crust was tasteless and the ingredients lacked that high quality flavor. It was a real disappointment. The meatballs were ok, they tasted too bready to me, but the bolgonese sauce with the rigatoni was a real surprise. My husband and I both liked it. n nIf I were judging the pasta and salad on its own, I'd give an A OK rating, but since the signature item is pizza. This was definitely ""meh "" and we were thankful our tab was about 50 off. It's definitely not worth full price.",1
"I stayed in the Mediterranean Tower on a Thursday until Sunday at The Riveria. There wasn't a refrigerator in our room, the room didn't come stocked with all of the essentials for travel, the TV service in the room is lacking HDTV with no HD and lousy low def lodgenet service , and we had two rooms we had booked to be next to each other, but they were not able to make this happen. However, the casino is very nice and the staff is very friendly, and there's a nice pool and a tattoo shop along with other shops. Just take note that the Mediterranean Tower is inexpensive, so expect to be a bit underwhelmed. The one thing that made my 3 star rating a 2 star was the unavailability of WiFi, which is crucial for someone like me. The WiFi was working great on our first night's visit, but then the WiFi network dropped off early the next day on my and my friend's devices, and I was unable to log on with my laptop computer. Certainly the hotel can provide better coverage, especially for someone who might have to remotely connect into work in the case of an urgent matter, and it would have also been nice to play music on too. Of course I was in an inexpensive part of the hotel, but I wouldn't stay at a hotel that didn't have reliable WiFi. I called the front desk to complain and they thanked me for reporting it, but unfortunately we were unable to get back on the WiFi network in my and my friend's room, and we were a good distance apart. I hate to say it, but I don't think I would stay at this hotel unless I was given a free night's stay in a better room with WiFi that will continue to work. Here's hoping they give me a chance to formulate a second opinion. ",1
I don't really care for the pasta dishes or the service here. My Chicken Parmesan was supposed to come with a salad which the waitress forgot until she brought my meal and asked if I still wanted it after my main dish was sitting there hot NO. Then my pasta which is half of my entree was still hard and undercooked so I ONLY ate the chicken breast. I was still hungry so she asked if I wanted to order something else from the menu! She didn't get it! My meal sucked I didn't get half of it and the other half was inedible and she wants to charge me for something else because I'm still hungry! I settled for a piece of cheesecake which had strawberry drizzle in the picture and it came with nothing on it. Blah. Nothing was great but their location.,1
Loved the place. Had the Turkey White out. Yummer! We will be back for dinner or lunch. But they are really busy and the servers have a hard time keeping up but I think but they did their best. We drove from the NW valley ! They were worth the trip.,2

"Being new to crossfit, I've always been intimidated to step in and try it out. That is, until I found Crossfit Embody! From day one I have found an extreme sense of teamwork. Everyone here works together and doesn't stop encouraging until the last person is done with their workout. Coach John and Coach Jeff's approach to fitness is unlike any other I've seen or tried. They are friendly and helpful, and will push you to your max with an extreme focus on technique to minimize injuries. Each new student is placed in a 6 course foundations class so that you are able to learn step by step techniques and foundations of crossfit at a slow pace and not feel bad for the advanced athletes that already know the basics. n nUnder Coach John's direction and dietary suggestions I was able to lose 16 pounds in just 12 weeks and the constant change of workout routines keeps me motivated to continue. If you are looking for a fun and effective way to get fit and healthy give Crossfit Embody a try! You won't regret it!",2
I'm surprised by some of the great reviews this place gets. I will never even try it again. Worst filet I have ever had and the service was terrible. Seriously not worth the drive off strip to eat here. I much prefer Canal Street in the Orleans for a decent steak.,1

"This is another great activity that the Red Rock Hotel and Casino offers. It is a huge bowling alley that is located near the Regal Cinema. The place is clean and the equipment is well maintained. I am not sure how many lanes there are, but like I said, the place is huge. They even have another section for private events and VIP bowling. You would think it would be over priced because it is located in a casino, but it's not bad at all. I have to admit though, I am not aware of what it costs to bowl anywhere else. I'm not a bowler. I just take the kids here to Red Rock. n nI only bowl once in a while with my kids and I'm not an authority on bowling alleys, but I would recommend you check this place out. The staff is very helpful too. Fun times!",2
I don't like to write bad reviews but I don't want you to waste your on vacation. I came for a celebrities birthday party so I had a free pass in. The bouncers in suits look to be respectable professionals. No. Just low end security guards who think they're important. I felt sad for them. That's what they do for a living? Choose and pick who goes into a club? I was at the front of the line with the Papparazi so I just sat back and observed since I had a free pass. They were rude to couples who had paid in advanced online. The couple claimed they waited 2 hrs. I met a very sweet fella in line who was getting in the face of the bouncers saying just coz he came alone they wouldn't let him in and he's been waiting for hours. The Papparazi were more well behaved than the 15 20 bouncers trying to maintain the crowds. There were lines everywhere. As long as their were 2 or more girls that walked up. The bouncers let them in. They all looked the same. Cocktail dresses and heels. Only difference was a different color and different face. I felt bad for the guy earlier and grabbed him. Told the bouncers he's with me so I let him beyond the velvet ropes. I saved this guy an outrages cover charge with my pass. I'm glad he didn't have to pay since he wasn't treated well. Inside was nothing special. It's like every other club in Down Town San Diego. All those pack of girls the bouncers let in were just sitting on the chairs looking bored. The dance floor was packed and we danced a few. I observed a bouncer being rude to patrons yelling and pushing them on the dance floor. Man I so wanted to slam him on the floor! I did like the little flame throwers the waitresses had. The celebrities bday performance was great. The club gave him a nice bday cake. When I left the club 4 AM there were still people outside trying to get inside. I so wanted to tell them. It's not worth it. Don't waste your time. If you are a celebrity this review doesn't pertain to you. They will be nice but anyone else. Spend your hard earned money somewhere else,1
"Well, recently we were like out of choices so we went there for dinner. But I assure you this was our last visit to this place. The dosas were horrible, nothing had any flavor to it. Idlis were dry. and it was soo hot inside, their AC was not working, Really, in AZ heat you do not care enough to repair the AC. the Nice waiter switched on a table fan for us that rotated between us and 2 other tables across from us. n nI would rather sit at home with my cool AC and cook my great Indian food on my own and make it much much better than they do.",1
"Yay for my first review her on Yelp! n nHandsdown, the best buffet I've ever tried in Vegas! I've tried Wicked Spoon which is 2nd best , Wynn also 2nd best , Studio B at M Hotel, Rio and Bellagio and Bacchanal surpasses all of them.

There weren't any lines and we were able to get in right away. But I'm warning you. Once dinner began, the place became packed quickly. Before we were seated, you get a mini tour of a buffet.

"Was a member of Steiner Club Card getting points for dollars when my family would eat there especially on Wednesdays with their 6.00 Hamburger and fries special where a family of. 4 can afford.

So the coupons and points I have are now useless and Steiner's advertises in Entertainment.com with a coupon doesn,t state age requirement.

"The only way to enjoy a tryst without fear of aggressive STDs? n nIt's a Thursday night. n nI'm not really a club type of guy, back home in Seattle I'm all about lounges, bars, and kitchy little places with mason jars for cups and pictures of obscure Films on the walls. But Vegas? Sin City? Viva Lost Wages? I gotta wild out. n nTryst was the second spot we hit on our March Madness Happy Birthday to my little brother trip.

"The delivery man came to my house and 1st thing he says when handing me the food which was prepaid is that I hadn't given him enough tip. I was a bit shocked because I usually tip 10 for a delivery. It's what I was told was the right amount to give. He didn't want to leave unless I give him more money, giving excuses like gas prices and how he came from the Plateau which is like 10 15 min from where I live . I didn't have anything else to give, for one, because I was quite insulted and also I had prepaid the order for a reason no cash with me . Then quite arrogantly he tells me people on the Plateau usually tip him 7 8 . That was like half the amount of my order! No way in hell would he ever deserve that much of a tip unless people order for 70 80 worth of food. What a douche. n nI'm sorry but my meal was quite ruined after that encounter and even if it was good, I'll never order from there again.",1
"Have done takeout dinners a few times and been pleased each time. Flavorful food and OK portions. I wish they would make the front deli counter window more attractive with better signage and product.

Outdoor seating is great to have, but in hotter weather inside seating is limited. Wish they would collect emails from customers and send out email specials to attract customers.",2

"Restaurant is rundown and dirty there were crushed fries on the floor, mustard bottle was oily. Smoked meat even the lean cut is way too fatty and greasy, we left huge chunks of fat in our plates.

Won't be going back.",1
"This review is for 8 18 14 lunch time. This was to be our last buffet before we headed back home from our vacation. We had decided to save a good one for the end and we were disappointed. Lunch for 2 people 50 and it was slim pickings, they still had breakfast out in 2 stations and when we were leaving they still had breakfast out. Not a big variety of items, the lay out reminds me of the planet Hollywood buffet, nothing exciting that would knock your socks off. The food was warm some items were a hit and miss, the dessert station was disappointing. Best thing I ate was the turkey and brisket, the flank steak was way too bloody. Will I go back? No, not for that price.",1
"Maybe living in Northern CA close to Napa and Sonoma has spoiled me. But based on the reviews in Yelp, as well as recommendation from a friend, we made a reservation at Le Cirque. Le Cirque was a huge disappoinment. We had a 9 15 reservation on a Friday night, we were promptly seated and the place was about 3 4 full. The wait staff, was not overtly friendly or energetic, nor very efficent, kind of like our entire experience there. I felt that perhaps the Le Cirque once had her day, but is now worn and in need of an eclectic upgrade think Gordon Ramsey . n nWe ordered a bottle of Cakebread Sauv Blanc and it was poured near room temperature, this to me is a fatal error for a high end French eatery, I asked them to bring a bucket of ice to the table which they did without complaint, is was drinkable in about 30 minutes. n nWe ordered the 4 course tasting menu, eh.just not impressed. The snow crab apettizer was decent, but just as in any good sushi place. The next course was a tiny piece of Foi Gras, which has carmelized and served over crisp bread, perhaps the best part of the meal, as the John Dory was cooked dry, and way under seasoned, think Tilipia. The Rabbit breast was again cooked to sawdust dry, tasteless. My wife had the Duck Breast which I tried, it was much better, but an extremley small portion. n nThe other thing, and I noticed other Yelper's commnented on it, was the long wait between courses, at times uncomfortably long. Our entire dinning experience was 2 hours and 45 minutes. When they brough the check and couldn't wait to pay and get the hell out of there!",1
"In 2004 when I saw my very first Cirque Du Soleil show Alegria at Randall's Island NY, my jaw dropped I got goose bumps! I was completely in awe of the music, choreography, acrobats.just everything about it was mesmerizing AMAZING! Since then, I have missed only one of their shows in NY. Over the years, that element of A.W.E. has diminished slightly human nature you see a lot of something, it loses its luster just a bit BUT they NEVER disappoint. Their shows are consistently entertaining just remarkable displays of talent imagination, and there is always a new theme. n nI saw Mystere during my visit to Vegas in January this year.was very entertaining, especially great for kids of all ages. Good family entertainment. More of a comic element to it than most of the other shows I have seen, really funny.",2
"One of the bad cab companies we used during a recent Vegas trip. The cab driver tried to long haul us when we asked him to drive us from the Rio to the Luxor. Instead of jumping on the I 15 and exiting on Tropicana, he was going to take us one exit further, which would have cost us another 8 10. n nWhen I asked him ""Dude, are you going to exit on Trop? "", he said ""You're going to the Luxor right? I'm taking you there. "".I said ""I used to live here for many yrs, don't bulls t me and exit on Trop. "" n nHe did and wasn't happy about it. Guess what, he got 0 tip from me. They get a of their fare anyway and we can't control that.but the last thing I was going to do was give this guy a tip for trying to long haul me. n nReturn Factor 5 ",1
"Was totally disappointed with this hotel. I chose it over the Hampton thinking it would be better. Well what a surprise I got. The room smelled horribly, I had to keep the window open the whole time which was right next to a busy road. The wifi didn't work at all. They brought a hard line to each room and it didn't even help. The staff at the front desk were lovely and tried to accommodate, but the hotel struck out as far as I was concerned. And it was DIRTY. We stayed two nights, packed our bags and moved a mile away to the Hampton which was cheaper and gorgeous compared to the Doubletree. If you have a choice, go with the Hampton, beautiful big clean rooms and the staff wonderful and great FREE internet as well. Sanjay totally took care of us at the Hampton. Do yourself a favor and stay away from the Doubletree.",1
"After two short lived Asian Restuarants closed down in this space, I was very excited to have another Mexican restaurant downtown. I like Baja Fresh, don't get me wrong but I really miss Acapulco when it was at this location and I was hoping for some good ole' East L.A. esque Mexican food. Sadly, Uno Mas didn't quite deliver. n nThe shredded beef tacos were the best part of my meal but they were just OK. Just a tad more flavor to the beef and we could be in business because it was moist and tender. The refried beans were just average. They weren't bad but I think I could have done just as well out of a can. The rice was pretty abhorrent. I seldom go to a Mexican place for their rice and don't hold it against anyone if the rice isn't good but the flavor here was just bad. I can't put my finger on what kind of bad, but it was bad. n nSo tacos that could have been better, beans that could have been out of a can and bad rice all adds up to a place that I sadly can't in good conscience recommend. n nTo top it off, it took three different visits before I could actually buy any food. The first time I went was after 2 00pm but before 3 00 but they had already closed. The second time they had to close early due to some equipment malfunction makes me think of Precious, the coffee kiosk lady on ""Come Fly With Me "" for all you BBC viewers . So from a pure effort point of view, it took me three times to get a meal here and when I got it it left a LOT to be desired. n nVery dissapointing. n nThat being said, they have just been open a few weeks, which is why I am giving two stars instead of one. Maybe I'll give it a month or two and try it again. If they can just flavor their beef a little more and try and turn out some good ole' homemade frijoles, I might eventually love them!",1
"After reading all the positive reviews here, my wife and I made this a high priority meal once we moved to town. What a great decision! n nAs others have said, the owner, Russell, was beyond inviting. He was helpful and friendly, making great suggestions and bringing us more than one thing for free bean sprouts, guava juice, Korean tea, a doughnut. . n nFor our meal, we each had the combo, which includes the excellent meat jun, a teriyaki sort of flavored chicken kabob, and kal'bi, which was absolutely a destination dish a dish that brings you back to a place . The food was amazing, matching service perfectly. n nPlease don't skip this place based on the store front or location an old strip mall on the South side of Sahara . It was an great meal with great service for a great value.",2
I just don't know how I feel about this place,1
For my daughters 21st Birthday we decided to take the family to Flemings and DC Ranch. We drive by this restaurant on a daily basis and yet have never given them a chance so I never knew what we were missing until now. The atmosphere is very nice they have a bar area with TV's if you just in for an informal high quality steak and outstanding cocktails. The service was simply outstanding we were treated like royalty and when one of the steaks delivered to the table we just a little overcooked they brought out the chef and insisted we allow them to make another. Best part is they let us keep the mistake thats nice when your talking a 50.00 piece of prime beef. The ribeyes are amazing ask for the ribeye that they bring to the table and cut off the bone for you WOW. The wine selection was among the best in Scottsdale and the cocktails a perfect blend. Thank you Flemmings for your fine contribution to my daughters 21st.,2
"I loved eating here, but as far as the nightclub goes, it's not my favorite. n nFirst off it's like a maze. The place is HUGE and gets way too packed. If you come with a big group, you're going to lose everyone. We always start off in the middle, get frustrated because there's no room to dance, go to the rooftop and dance a bit only to find that it's slowly getting packed. It's overwhelming.",1
Seriously took 20 minutes just to get one burrito from the drive through! Haven't even taken a bite yet so can't comment on the food yet. Just super bugged that it's taking so long.,1
"I recently discovered Pho this year and ever since I have been trying to find the most authentic Pho that one would be able to get here in Phoenix. Out of all the places I have tried, Viet Kitchen is the one with a flavorful broth. The whole restaurant smells of star anise and all the other spices that goes into the broth. If you are not used to these flavors, it can be a bit over powering, which was the case for my boyfriend. He enjoys Pho Thanh's Pho, which he says is a bit bland but saltier than the one we tried. n nSo, if you have the taste buds for authentically made broth, I'd recommend trying it at least once. n nPS n nAs for the location, it is easy to find and the inside is a bit small. The decor is comforting but I found it confusing when it came to being seated. There was not anyone at the door to greet us and I wasn't sure if it was a Seat Yourself kind of place but after walking to the bar and asking, I find out we needed to wait to be seated. The only downer is that they do not serve water once seated. It took about 10 minutes of waiting before we finally received our waters. Other than that, I plan on coming here for the days I get to choose the Pho, as for my boyfriend, he'll most likely be sticking to Pho Thanh 17th Ave Camelback .",2
dirty with paper thin walls.,1
Delicious sandwiches! Okay so I am convinced that in every good sandwich shop everyone is stoned I think it's an unwritten rule and Cheeba Hut is of course no exception to this rule. As the name implies this is a stoner sandwich shop. Then menu is huge and full of unique and delicious sandwiches! I have had quite a few of them and they are all tasty. The hemp cream cheese is the die for. Also don't forget to grab a rice crispy treat complete with tons of random cereals thrown in. This is a great spot.,2
"One of the more inventive menus I've seen at a tavern. The mustard sauce on the pretzel crusted chicken was delicious, but the Brussel sprouts were slightly disappointing.",2
"Wow. I just wish I could tell the people there on Monday at around 5 5 30, that you are lucky that I punched the fence and not your face. n nWhat a nightmare. Most of the dogs there ran over mine, only one stepped up. Apparently her dog just likes to play with little dogs. Really, is that why your mutt attacked mine when we were in between the exit gates trying to leave? It's ok, he just likes to play, right? I do have to give her some credit because at least she kind of tried obviously not hard enough . Unlike ALL the others that just sat there. I saw two dogs take massive dumps and no one did anything. This was like a minefield of dump.Then I got the pleasure of stepping in a pile and squishing it into my Adidas. I asked if anyone cleaned their dogs shit, no response. But a couple with an ugly crap dog laughed. Another that repeatedly ran over mine and all they could say, ""oh stop pickin on that dog "" NOT BOTHERING TO REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM THE BENCH! It took all I had not to show them something that was really funny. My dog getting trampled and yelping and stepping in dog shit, not funny. Taking my poop shoe and rubbing it in your face.now that is hilarious. But I refrained. nBy the time I pulled that dog off mine which was followed by someones stupid mouth I thought, hit the fence out of sheer anger, or go to jail for beating someone? I chose fence. Not a peep came out of peoples mouths then. Don't let the blond hair and small dogs fool you, I will beat you down like your momma obviously should have. n nIf you got a big dog and it chases the little dogs and tramples them, do yourself a solid and CONTROL YOUR DOG. Because the next time, it could be mine that it trampled, and I'm out of free passes on that situation.",1
"What a wonderful place. The owner herself gave us a great introduction to how she makes the gelato and gave us tastes of many flavors without even asking! There are both more ""traditional "" as well inventive flavors. We got salted caramel, Greek yogurt, and tiramisu. Good price, FANTASTIC gelato!",2
"This is an excellent facility. Both of my kids have flourished since beginning lessons last year, and they enjoy coming to the classes. n nObviously, it isn't cheap so be prepared for that hit to your pocketbook each month. However, you can find ways to make the most of the cost, especially during the winter months. Make sure to watch for the emails mentioning open classes and respond quickly. If you have the time, you can get a number of free classes in each week. n nOne of the better places for swim lessons in the area.",2
Great food but I'm tired of the unfriendly staff and less then good service. I wi t be coming here anymore. I guess I'll just find somewhere else to spend my money.,1
"I come here. When I'm desperite. Service mediocre, and I'm ALWAYS down for all you can eat sushi, but I seem to get heckled about my options. Eh. Most times i get a semi dirty table, why i still go? Hungry. nThe miso soup is the best you can hope for, and i feel the servers are usuallyh playing dumb.",1
"Going to the dentist is never number one on my list of things to do, but Southview makes the task a little easier. n nThe staff is extremely friendly and knows their patients by name. There are two doctors in this location.a husband and wife, Dr. Kelly and Dr. Michael. Dr. Kelly handles cleanings and routine checkups while Dr. Michael does the oral surgery for the office. I've been going here for about a year and a half. In this time I've had a few cleanings and a all four wisdom teeth removed. Dr. Kelly is sweet and explains if you've got any issues with your teeth. Dr. Michael removed my wisdom teeth earlier this year, I choose not to get anesthesia so he talked me though the entire process. He made the removal easy as it could be and a big bonus is he sounds like Matthew McConaughey! n nI seen a few people talk about Jen and the bad experiences they had with her. I can agree she wasn't the best person for the job, she rubbed me the wrong way before and I almost didn't come back. Lucky she's no longer working here! n nIf you're looking for a new dentist give Southview a try. n nOh yeah can't forget that on your first visit you get free lunch downstairs from noodles and Company.winning!",2
"oh man this is the mecca of pinball games. Yeah this is the place where one goes when they are burned out on any casino game and tired of your xboxes and PlayStation's. This is a place where you go play games that are basic and fun. I have always said that pinball is better than any game out there. I just love this place many many games from the newest ""the dark Knight "" to old ones from the 60's. You can have so much fun here it is not funny. On top of pinball games they also have some old arcade games like original Mario Bros. and punch out to pong. Also they repair pinball games there too, I would take mines in but I live in California. I recommend this place to all. Just a heads up it may feel like a comic book shop cause it dark and dank but once you get playing it will feel like home.",2
"On a beautiful winter day you might not mind the 45 minutes standing in line and the additional 15 minute wait for your food.you just have to know what to expect! n nMy friend and I shared the infamous BBQ Chicken pizza and a Ceasar Salad w chicken. We thoroughly enjoyed both! The salad was crisp and fresh. The dressing is creamy delicious the chicken breast is perfectly prepared leaving it moist and finger lickin' good! n nI loved the pizza that must be done in a really hot oven leaving the crust browned and crisp, topped with plenty of chicken, bacon and a very tasty sauce. n nWhat would have made it 5 stars? The table chairs on the patio were so wobbly I thought I'd knock the table over cutting my food and I don't like the 45 minute wait.",2
"My main gripe with this hotel is the unfriendly unvegas like staff. Most of the time when I stay in vegas, the staff treats me with a great deal of respect and hospitality, regardless of how cheap the hotel rooms are. This was not the case here. n nI requested 2 attached rooms for my party. When I checked in, they gave me 2 rooms on different floors. I told them that I needed 2 attached rooms, but they told me nothing was available until tomorrow. I accepted this and waited until the next day. The next day I went down and requested my room change. The entire time the check in lady was fixing this error, she was sighing and rolling her eyes at me like I was wasting her time. I wanted to tell her off saying that they are wasting my time, not the other way around, but I held back. n nAnyway, the rooms are the pretty standard 35 a night rooms in vegas. Oh and btw, the 20 trick almost never works here.",1
"I thought I'd give Mark's Cafe a chance seeing as how they're the ""little guy "" struggling to get by, however, lying to customers is the biggest fail imaginable. Our waitress, Mark's daughter, insisted that we have one of their famous homemade muffins that they make fresh every morning. ""We sell over a hundred a day and only have a few left, "" she bragged. I could see them sitting at the kitchen window and they looked suspiciously like Costco's muffins. As a former coffee shop cafe owner myself I can pretty much spot a Costco muffin a mile away. She then rattled off the flavors, again each style sounded suspiciously familiar. I decided to try one, giving them the benefit of the doubt, but one bite into it I knew it wasn't homemade. I then googled the flavors and the google autocomplete finished each with ""costco. "" Ultimately, I got duped into paying 4 for a 50 cent store bought muffin. It's one thing to sell store bought muffins, it's another to lie to customers about it.",1
"Sad and confusing lunch experience. I mistakenly went to Sakura as I thought it was Teriyaki Madness which I'd bookmarked as a place to escape for lunch. Teriyaki Madness is somewhere down the road and because I'd already parked and walked up to the door, it wasn't worth another 15 minutes for me to hop down to Teriyaki Madness. What a tragic mistake. n nCalling Sakura a restaurant is generous. Service was terrible the girl who was playing cashier was rude and was having conversation with the other two guys behind the counter while I was ordering. Ramen isn't a complicated order, but at least give me the courtesy of your full attention when I'm ordering my food. I got the tonkatsu ramen and my Maruchan packet of noodles was served with a questionably cloudy broth too much miso? and three thin and DEEPLY unsatisfying pieces of pork. Yes I counted them. I kept hoping that my wandering chopsticks would bump into another piece of pork but kept coming up empty. I am embarrassed to say I finished most of the bowl because I was so hungry. n nI am also embarrassed to admit that I tipped 1 because this is one of those fast food establishments that presumptuously adds a tip line on their receipts. The only service I got here was someone dumping a pack of noodles into a plastic bowl, stirring up the ingredients and serving it to me when the noodles were soft. This does not constitute a tip of any sort and based on the uncomfortable 30 seconds at the register, watching the sushi chef roll sushi, ordering sushi does not warrant a tip either. He made one of the sloppiest rolls I've ever seen. If someone served me that roll, I'd send it back.and I don't send anything back. n nYes, along with shamefully terrible ramen, they dare to serve eat at your own risk sushi. I imagine the rest of the menu is unauthentic Americanized Japanese dishes. I'd rather go lick the floor of the Chipotle next door than eat here again. But I'll probably just get a burrito instead.",1
We stayed here on a time share. It's not like the Vegas hotels on the strip but its ok.,2
Food was great. Best prime rib I have ever had. Looking at my credit card I was billed 15 over what I signed. Called the GM Jaison Sokolow he said sorry and will give me the 15 back because of the error. I'll never go back.,1
"It may sound like a 4 year old wrote the review of this fine steakhouse because i would go here just to eat the French fries and Mac n cheese. n nBread before your meal is overrated bring me duck fat french fries any day. As for the truffle mac n cheese it is the best side dish I have ever eaten in any restaurant anywhere in the world. It's really that good! n nDon't cheat yourself, if you are in Vegas go to stripsteak and get any of the awesome steaks but make sure you get the Mac n cheese!",2
"I dunno what bean counter took over this place, but seriously, dude, stop counting the beans. And steak. And pork. The last three times I've been, I've had to remind the preparer that a quarter ounce of meat does not a taco make. You know who is down the block? Salsaritas. At the moment they own your ass. And my dollar",1
This is the only disappointing target store I've been too. They are always under construction and its hard to get in out of the parking lot and nothing interesting or good to eat in the shopping center. But target is still the same good helpful and friendly service and quality stuff at a low price 100X better then Wal Mart,1
"God, no. I never want to eat here again. The pizza was mediocre at its best and dripping grease. The drinks weren't good, and the dessert was the worst. We had a brownie sundae and the brownie was rock hard. They brought us another one and it was softer but still crumbling, and tasted like Kroger brand boxed brownies. Wow, worst quality food I've had in a while.",1
Loving the euro fries bahn mi dog!,2
Aguachile tostadas were delicious! Real authentic. Shrimp cocktail was ok. Owner is very nice.,2
This is great casual wine bar to have a drink and the food is very good as well!nThey have outdoor patio area which is nice in cooler weather. The prices are very good here and great for a date night or meeting friends! Its in Old town Scottsdale area which we love. They have couch and chairs to sit in as well inside.,2
I love this place. Awesome food and cool atmosphere. Beer is good and cold.,2
"So, my first experience here was last night. I drove up from Tucson to meet a friend from Phoenix and this was a good meeting point. n nThe atmosphere is fairly nice and comfortable. The servers are attentive and helpful, very nice. I had a glass of pinot which was pretty good for a house wine. n nFor dinner, I ordered the Chicken Piccata. The sauce was way too salty and the chicken was literally tough. The sauce seemed like it was a jarred or pre made sauce. It just wasn't very good.",1
"Only reason I'm even giving it 2 stars is because the food was decent. Service not so much. And when you go to pay they tell you it's a ""minimum "" 25 dollars if your using multiple credit cards when that little fact is clearly not stated ANYWHERE. She tried to say it charges the house if it's under 25 dollars. Either management is completely stupid or the owners a penny pincher, either way I've never had that happen before and def won't be back again.",1
"I've seen this show a number of times at different venues. It simply rocks. The venue here, Hooters Lounge, is relatively small and intimate. I think there were about 100 people seeing the act. Everyone got a seat, all with tables. The show runs close to two hours and there's plenty of entertainment bang for your buck. I guarantee you will like the show. The only downside is it is at Hooters, which is on the pedestrian side. Like just about everyone else, you just roll in and out for the show you are golden. n nMay 2012 Update The show just moved to the ""D "" Las Vegas casino hotel, which is located downtown near the Fremont Experience area. There, the show starts at 10 30 pm and runs until just after midnight. I saw the show here on 7 5 12. While the casino is in a more gritty area, the act is the same. Further, the showroom holds about 100 people. The seating is close and intimate. The majority of seats, including general admission, have a great view of the show. There is a bartender, but no waitress table service. n n2013 Update Purple Reign is now back at Hooters with its own showroom upstairs. n n2014 Update They are now at Planet Holloywood. All of the seats are good, so don't pay for VIP unless you wanna pay extra to sit in the first few rows. n nLate 2014 Update P.R. jumped from the ""D "" downtown to the newly crowned Westgate old LVH , which is close to downtown. The play in the Shimmer Showroom, which is a very nice venue. n nTip get your tickets ahead of time and you may save some cash Look for discount coupons in the magazines around town . If you buy general admission, just get in line early and you'll get a good seat. All customers are escorted to seats, so there's no bum's rush to get a spot. For VIP tickets, you are just feet from the stage. They will also give you a free T shirt, which they sell for 20. n nIf you're in the mood to party, this is a great show to see. You'll get plenty of feel good bang for your buck, considering what you can pay for other shows.",2
"The service here is good, but thats as good as it gets. The salsa is disgusting the food is bland and unidentifiable and its just generally annoying",1

"Normally, I don't like to leave negative reviews. However, the lack of sanitary procedures here drives me to do so. First, she didn't wash her hands after her previous client. Second, she didn't change the sheet on the table. Third, she didn't even change the paper towel that went under my head. Triple ick. I left without getting the procedure done.",1
"I can only imagine the sheer number of Yelpers gasping at the four stars above. To them I say desist your food snobbery and listen up. n nWith the likes of the over rated Fountain and the, for me, yet to experience but often lauded Caley Sample Rooms in the near vicinity, you'd be forgiven for never trying McCowans. After all it is just some chain menu, run of the mill, football showing, gastro average Joe. n nBut I would challenge that and say McCowans was an HONEST Joe. n nIn fairness McCowans doesn't try to be something it's not. It doesn't even claim to be something it's not. The food is nothing special, but it's nothing to be sniffed at either. This is the kind of place you can come along to, grab a seat on the deep leather couch in the corner and order a chicken burger, sausage and mash or a curry of the day for only u00a34. n nAnd you know what you'll get? A half decent gastro meal worth u00a34. No more, no less. That doesn't sound like much, but I'll bet after you step out of McCowans you'll feel like u00a34 commands a little more quality than you thought it did. n nWhen you consider the number of wannabe quality gastro pubs, for example the infinitely underwhelming 1780 on Rose Street, who charge u00a36 for a starter and u00a311 a main, that leave you feeling robbed, questioning where the flavour was, where the ingredients were foraged, what jail their chef just got released from. Okay that last one's a bit harsh the point is there are plenty of over priced pubs with fancy menus and zero quality out there. And every one of them will have you appreciating exactly what McCowans is. n nOn top of that they brew their own beers, they have enough telly boxes to play more than one football match at a time, they have oodles of space to lounge, they're right beside a cinema, casino and bowling alley. And they have some of the friendliest, most consistently decent bar staff I've encountered. Honestly I defy you to get served by one of the bearded lads at the bar and NOT be engaged in conversation. Doing their job well. n nIf you're still in doubt, try the Joey Sunday Challenge n nWhen you've had a large weekend, you're feeling a bit tender and looking for something to make you feel a little better. Get on Cineworld online, get yourself tickets to a nice wee movie, and get yourself to McCowans an hour early for a pre movie bite. n nOn Sundays McCowans not only offer full Sunday Roasts, but even more enticing are the Yorkshire Pudding Rolls. Choose from either Chicken, Gammon or Beef, and they place the meat in a giant Yorkshire, roll that badboy up like a wrap, chop it in half and serve it up with some roasties and a wee jug of gravy. Boom enjoy your movie! Doctor couldn't prescribe anything better for a sensitive Sunday afternoon. n nIf that doesn't win you over try the desserts. just wow! n nAnd if even that fails, don't worry about it. At least you gave it a try. cough snob cough !",2
"For all the great reviews on Yelp I was disappointed. Especially when I looked in the kitchen to see the head Chef chomping on a Big piece of gum, with his mouth open! The burger was pretty good but not that special. The onion rings were just okay too. My wife and I split a burger, onion rings and a shake. The only thing we finished was the Ben n Jerry's shake. We could have gotten just that across the hall at Ben N Jerry's and avoided the burger that is priced for 2 but sized for 1, even if we didn't finish it. It was anticlimactic after reading all the great the reviews here and Google. Good burger but nothing special. The cheapest burger is 10.50 and has No meat if that tells you about pricing. Maybe the chef missed the special sauce on ours?",1
"I was craving Japanese food and was a bit nostalgic about the lunches I had while living in Japan. I noticed Takumi while heading for a dinner with family members on a previous evening, so I thought I'd give it a try. I had the pork cutlet bento and was very pleased. The cutlet was very tender and the breading was crisp and light. The sushi choice was a bit uninspired, California roll, but it was tasty. The box was beautifully presented and more than adequate in quantity for a very filling lunch. I did have to ask for rice, which seemed a bit odd. My waiter was very apologetic and provided the rice promptly. The prices were reasonable and the service was excellent. The lapse with the rice and the uninspired choice of sushi are the only things keeping me from giving this a five star rating. Takumi satisfied my nostalgia for Japan and gave me a very satisfying lunch experience.",2
"My ears always perk up at the sound of ""Michelin "".our meal at Wing Lei was definitely not the best of my life, but it was very exceptional. Especially for Chinese food.

"Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. My bf and I go all the time for brunch, and they also have really good burgers too.

"This was once my favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte, until a recent visit where I found the menu to be completely changed, with a whole lot of great rolls missing. The XOXO used to be the reason I came here, I couldn't find a roll like it anywhere else, now that along with the crunchy salmon rolls, the kawai roll appetizers and the entire dessert menu are gone. I can't understand why so many favorites would be removed from a restaurant's menu. And I could not find a good alternative on the menu. Unfortunately Pisces has now gone from my favorite sushi place in Charlotte that I took all of my out of town visitors to, to a place I am unlikely to return to. Sky Asian Bistro, RuSan's, and Nikko now all blow Pisces out of the water. Shame really. Was a great place.",1
"I've been eating here once a month for a few years now. Recently went in and I think they changed the chef. The food was sooo salty. Way over salted. I know what it usually tastes like, so this was a bit of a surprise. The beef in my burrito tasted like ocean water.plus. I'll give them another try but they need to get a grip on this or I wont be back.",1
"Between 2 and 3 stars. A few things were good turkey, beef ribs . Tri tip would've been good but it was very undercooked. Consensus is a step up from Old Country Buffet.",1
Went once after this place just opened. Very disappointed. Over salty pasta and mediocre apps. Service was ok. Will not returned.,1
"So.this was the second time I had come to the VooDoo and had a completely different experience than I had the first time. We had made reservations weeks in advance for a birthday party for 7. We arrived on time, and were seated RIGHT inside the door with a nearly empty dining room. We asked the unfriendly guy at the desk if there was any way the move, to which he replied 'no'. We sat there for the majority of our dinner staring at empty table after table much farther into the dining room. So while the food was good as always we were treated like dirt by the hostess staff. Our waiter was good and tried to make it better, but we started with a sour taste for the place and left with the same sour taste. I was disappointed because I'm the one who suggested it.not sure I'll go back.",1
"Located in The Flamingo Hotel Casino on the Famous Las Vegas Strip. Ok 20 for lunch really?!? The bellagio is a couple of bucks more and 100000000000 times better. Make the walk over there instead, it's right across the street and let's be honest before and after filling your face with a Las Vegas Buffet, the stroll will do you good. Also the service sucks here, the waiter walked by my empty drink no less than 8 times before offering to refill it. Life is too short for overpriced tourist trap buffets, skip this one and hit up Bellagio. You will thank me later. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",1
"I should've followed my gut when I first walked through the doors. Waiting for more than 5 minutes to be greeted. Then I was never told how long for a haircut. After waiting what seemed to be an appropriate time, once in the chair I was told by the hairstylist I was being sat before the lady who was next in line. As if I was being done a favor. Go in order and tell me how long I need to wait, I'll be patient and wait my turn. nMore importantly is the hairstylist. He didnt listen. I wanted to trim the sides and leave the length on the top. I left with a lot less on the top, and the sides uneven. I mentioned the sides were uneven and he said they weren't. Should've gone with my gut. Hair looks bad and I'm unhappy. Had to go get it fixed elsewhere. nMaybe this place focuses on womens hair and not mens. Ill give them the benefit of the doubt, again.",1
"This was at least the 2nd time we've been to Cafe Bink. Overall the food was excellent, but the menu could use some updating and a couple details could be improved. For example, why not serve the bread warm rather than cold? We started with the dates, which were local, and the pulled to order mozzarella, which we particularly enjoyed who doesn't love delicious fresh cheese. For entrees, my wife had the salmon loved it , my sister in law had the bolognese loved it , and I debated btw the trout and the fried chicken. I ended up with the fried chicken which was great but maybe a little heavy on the breading. I remember at least the bolognese, the trout, the fried chicken and the fish and chips from our last visit 3 years ago. I'm not sure if the menu has changed at all since then. I joked with my wife that we were one ahi tuna stack and one molten chocolate cake away from a culinary time machine. And then we saw the chocolate puddin' cake on the dessert menu, which was basically a spoonable molten chocolate cake in a jar. It was awesome and delicious and perfect but the point still stands. We also had the doughnuts for dessert as well but they were definitely overcooked we think the oil must not have been hot enough. Overall everything other than the doughnuts tasted excellent. Great place. Nice meal.",2
"This place is like a scandalous girl. The location has easy access, looks pretty, good vibes, everything! Our server, Aaron had wonderful helpful service. He was over the top nice. I like to let employees pick our drinks he chose a melon mojito some kind of tequila cocktail. Both delicious! the 2nd one was even free! Kahuna's loco moco burger was one of the messiest, yummiest burgers. As a hawaiian food fan, this hit the spot. I want to come back at night when there's loud music flare tenders. KahunaVille will make you want to keep ordering their intruiging drinks! Definitely an underrated place.",2
I've seen quite a lot of cirque shows now and this one was just amazing. The music alone was incredible. Performers were very talented. This is a must do when in Vegas!,2
"Very good food, very good service. A little bit pricey but worth going. Definitely recommend this place for a guaranteed good moment.",2
"I'm pretty picky when it comes to eating soon tofu because for one I hate smelling like tofu soup and kbbq and it sticks. If I'm going to eat something that makes you smell, it better be good! n nI found this place in chinatown and it was good! The soup was flavorful and they tended to my needs. I ask for a lot of condiments and I alter my food quite often. But overall, a great experience. They give banchan side dishes so its like little appetizers for you like most korean places. It kind of fills in the time you wait for your food. I always get the combination with the beef and seafood. The beef is tender and the seafood is just yummy. n nThey usually only have 1 working the floor so thats the downside. They get help from the kitchen but sometimes the service isn't as up to par if you're eating in. I have dined in but mostly take to go. I didn't dock an extra star and felt they deserved 4 because they don't forget my alterations and always make sure I have what I need when I pick up my food. n nWorth a try if you're craving tofu soup!",2
Love the pizza. Idk what's going on here with ppl posting bad reviews about their pizza but come on people! I'm from Brooklyn New York and I'll tell you their pizza is one of the best I found in Las Vegas!,2
"The food was good, but the bad service really ruined the entire experience. If I go back it'll be to pick up my phone order since the establishment shows priority to those doing so.",1
"Great show. Very good seating. Amazing stunts and diving. I liked better than ""O "" my wife thinks the opposite. Make sure you leave time for walking the casino it is great.",2
"So before I start this review, I just want to mention that I've never been to a steak house before and it was my birthday soooooo . . . yeah. n nThat being said, this place was amazing. We were staying in Planet Hollywood anyway and I wanted to eat somewhere fancy for dinner and then place did the job. We were late for our reservation but they were about to still fit us in and sat us quickly, which they definitely didn't have to do. rThe place is decorated with 1920's models thats range of clothed to quasi nude models in way that was kinda classy but didn't interfere with your dinner either. The low lights and red interior gave it an intimate feel too. n nOur waiter was a combination of charismatic and creepy, in a way that was very entertaining to me. I don't know if it was on purpose or not but either way he was very good at his job. One of my friends suggested I get the ribeye steak medium well so I went with that and I was not dissappointed! No one was in fact, not even the vegetarian! She ordered a 2 sides instead of steak and still didn't finish everything . Probably the most surprising item was the grean beans cause they were freaking delicious. I was stuffed and could stop eating them. In fact, many of the sides that we ordered could be shared with at least one other person. They are kinda big and so flavorful, so they were also pretty filling. n nWe decided to get the 25 layer chocolate cake for dessert. That's right. 25 LAYERS! Again, I couldn't stop eating it and I don't even like cake that much. I had mentioned to the waiter and supervisor that was working that my birthday was my favorite holiday, so when the cake come out, it had a candle in it and Happy Birthday was written on the cake. They waiter and sup even came by and said ""Have fun on your favorite holiday! "" It was something simple and easy that they didn't have to do at all but they did. 5 stars!",2
"Recently got a chance to visit Verde for Sunday Brunch. n nSat outside on their patio which is dog friendly and the main reason we visited here . n nThe service staff is super friendly to our dog too! nThe bloody marys are on point. nThey have some of the best fresh chips I have had in a while. n nI ordered the Chiliquilles with Chorizo recommended for sure.if I had a hangover, this would of killed it . n nAlso had the granola pancakes which were super fresh and a great sweet alternative. n nOthers had their version of Eggs Benedict which was a major success. n nDefinitley coming back next time I'm in PGH.",2
"I purchased one of the 45 50 Buffet of Buffet passes giving me access to 7 different casino buffets in a 24 hour period. Some of the choices seemed not so good, but I remembered this buffet as being halfway decent when I had tried it years and years ago. n nThe line was much shorter than on my first trip. I remember about 8 9 years ago, the line went out the door almost into the casino. This time, there were maybe 15 25 people ahead of us. They were a little slow with seating, but nothing outrageous. n nThe food? Pretty good. I'd say the quality is fairly good, but the selection is a bit lower than my favorite Bellagio , but still, you are presented with a pretty impressive spread. Then again, I just need a few staples done well with a few flourishes and I'm pretty happy. I'm fairly gluttonous at all you can eat buffet set ups, and I was able to eat my fill. I think of everything I tried, there was only one thing that I didn't really enjoy. n nTL DR it's one of the cheaper buffets on the strip, the line wasn't ridiculous, you can get it as part of a package deal. Fairly good food if you just want a few staple items to shovel into your face.",2
"This Fry's is the closest Grocery Store to my new apartment. I just moved in over the weekend, and went out exploring the neighborhood. I have been to a few Fry's grocery stores in the Tempe area before, and generally liked the stores, but this one felt inferior. I found the place to have a feel of the Ghetto Pavilions that I went to on occasion while I was still living in Long Beach. The aisles are narrow and dingy, with holes were product should be on the shelves. The main detraction is the cashiers. The young lady I had the misfortune of dealing with was rude and not helpful at all. Maybe it was that I was a bit more enthusiastic than the normal customer, but she seemed like she was having a bad day. She looked like she has had several bad days in a row, and her hair was messed up and her teeth were nasty. The courtesy clerk I know the official title, because it was my first job as a kid did not ask me what style bag I preferred, and stuffed everything in a single plastic bag, which he ripped. The carts all had bum wheels, and the parking lot was filthy. I'm not going back. Instead, I'll plan my grocery trips and head to the Basha's a few blocks from here.",1
"If we could get my g parents network switched over, I'd NEVER have them return to this St Lukes. Quality of care seriously depends on who's on shift and what floor you're on. Cath Lab and ICU staff has always been fantastic, but staff on the 7th floor is a hit or a miss. Likewise with staff in the ER. n nSeriously makes me wonder WHY some people get into the medical field, when they clearly are not cut out for working in that type of environment.",1
"Sigh.so, contrary to what I wrote in the previous review, I HAVE returned to this Dunkin many times, in fact . They have since been very pleasant, and the coffee has been delicious pumpkin iced coffee yay! . I am guessing that the first time I stopped by was just an off day.",2
"An amazing meal, hands down. I was there with a small group and not a soul went unsatisfied. n nWe drank a fantastic Bordeaux that coupled well with the lamb and kobe beef, but the dish that earned everyone's envy was the lobster pot pie. Simply incredible. n nThis is definitely on the procey side, but if you are like me and go to vegas for the shows and food read no gambling this place is a must try.",2
"Fresh Easy is a delightful addition to the neighborhood. Love the prices, love the produce, and love the pre made items. Not a huge fan of the meats here, but I'm weird about meat anyway, so that's all on me. I love that I can seamlessly shop and be secure knowing that the ingredients are worthy or serving to my precious little fam. What was life like before we knew about Fresh Easy's peanut butter pretzels.hello? I love that items such as brussel sprouts, radishes, the pain in the rear to clean produce, is all neatly packaged and cleaned! I hear this location is the busiest in the state one of the smallest. Great staff We just love it!",2
"Good food and very affordable. We ordered the wanton soup with BBQ pork, hot beef dish, and roast duck, we also ordered the guy land dish not knowing the guy land comes one the side of every dish. The duck is kinda dry but this place is good and fast service.",2
Disclaimer I remember Z'Tejas when it was first created by Guy Villavaso and Larry Foles in Scottsdale. I ate there yesterday at one of the chain's generic locations and was very disappointed. The place wreaks of a casual dinning chain. Gone is the cutting edge southwest cuisine that made it great. If you want a southwest style Marie Callender's by all means give it a try.,1
This great clips is not crowded. But not the best when compared to 34th ave and some others nearby. Went in once and they started cutting my hair.No question on what you want to do or what clipper you use I was first time there,1
"We've enjoyed Rusconi's by ourselves, with friends and with a group. Always fun and always fabulous food. The staff is great the food is yummy with wonderful presentation, there are always a few ""ooh and aahs "" when we get our plates.",2
This place is gross. The food is not good at all. n nMy husband and I were in search for good Mexican food and still are good thing we only ordered one burrito I couldn't even choke it down,1
Horrible Service and very average food. Blown away by all these reviews. n nThis is basically IHOP with a full bar.,1
"Hotel was average, my view was ok but only on 7th floor. Be prepared to do alot of walking, it's so crazy how if you get on the wrong elevator you end up on some mystery floor. Everything is totally expensive in the restaurants and bars, the back alley bars bartenders charge different prices every time you order the same drinks, it's totally odd, burgers are 15 dollars just for a cheese burger that is all dry and nasty . and be totally ready to have everybody offer ""upgrades "" some do it nice and some are just down right pushy and sneaky, telling you how much better it is blah blah blah, worked one time on me with the rental car but not again.everybody wants your money so have a budget and watch out for the scary area's and hookers.",1
Only took 30 minutes. These folks know what their doing and what they're talking about! This place was great! I was diagnosed with a tonsil abscess within minutes of going into the back room. I had to go to the ER over at St. Rose and the doctor called over so I would have to wait in the ER. I would recommend them to anyone!,2
"So far Windy City Beef n Dogs is the best Chicago style fast food I've found in Vegas. Too bad it's on the opposite side of town from where I live or I'd go there more often. n nThey have all the real stuff Vienna Beef dogs, poppy seed buns, Italian beef, sausage, Maxwell St. Polish, even pizza puffs and tamales. I think they even have Old Style beer on tap! n nYou can't beat the 2 dog special with fries for 6 when other places in town are charging 6 for a single dog! n nTheir beef sausage combo is as good as any I've had in Chicago. I hadn't had one in almost 2 years and it was really good stuff although a bit expensive. n nI think they just recently added gyros sandwiches to their menu and I had one the other night. As with their other stuff the portion was ample and it was made with care. My only gripe is they are using pre sliced gyros and don't have the whole spit rotisserie setup. I would encourage them to get the whole setup. I know it must be an expensive outlay originally, but having a good gyros in the lineup completes the Chicago menu nicely. n nThe restaurant looks like it's a family run place. All the people behind the counter are real Chicagoans who put the necessary care into the food and they really respect the tradition. It shows in the quality and taste. n nIf you want to have your own Chicago cook out, they even sell all the dogs, beef, sausages, buns and fixings by the pound to take home. n nI'll continue to go back when I can. How about opening a Henderson location? ",2
I might need to try this place again to see if my order just got messed up. I ordered a vegetarian fajita to go. The guac was good and fresh. There were no tortillas and no beans so I had to buy a bag of peanuts after I ate this since I was still hungry. I do not eat a lot at one time as well. Aren't veggie fajitas supposed to come with beans?,1
"My first time here and I love it. The menu is playful, fun with a lot of variety. Being able to enjoy made to order crepes with Sugar Factory signature cocktails is delightful. I can't wait to bring my family next time. Great place for adults and family.",2
Hakkasan Restaurant is def the most high end Chinese spot in town. They pay attention to detail more than any place I've ever been to. The service is great and the food is to die for. I suggest the duck salad as an appetizer and the miso cod for an entree. You can't go wrong with these two dishes. Reservation is highly recommended as they fill up fast on weekends.,2
"The wait was only 30 mins! woohoo! Tried this new beautifully decorated buffet after a long day and boy was it worth it! It was about 100 with tip for two people. It is a huge place with every food type you can imagine. I especially enjoyed the seafood section with the huge king crab legs, oysters, giant shrimps, and loved the lobster chowder! The carving stations was also great with a selection of ribeye, lamb chops, and prime rib .You can tell they take care to ensure that each item is of quality. Now onto my favorite part, dessert! In my opinion, the desserts at wicked spoon at the cosmo were better, but don't get me wrong I still thought the ones here were good. Loved their creme br u00fbl u00e9e and macarons. I would definitely come back to try a lot of the items that i couldn't fit in my belly this first time! I probably wouldn't wait more than an hour but if I was here and the wait was reasonable Id stick around ",2
"My husband and I had breakfast here on a Saturday morning. It was predictably busy, but since we were ok with sitting at the counter, we didn't have to wait long at all. A few highlights n the cinnamon roll. warm, gooey, and crazy delicious. helps that I was hungry n a free refill on the fresh squeezed oj?! yes, please! I got the refill to go and pro tip she gave me a little more to fill the cup all the way n nSo the neighborhood perhaps isn't the greatest and the views aren't anything special, but there's plenty of convenient parking and I appreciate being able to get an awesome breakfast without having to drive all the way to Scottsdale. So why only 4 stars? Hubby wasn't wowed. Maybe he didn't love the banana pancakes as much as he should have. I thought my popeye omlet was very tasty! Fast, friendly service and a decent sized menu that has all the things you'd want and more.",2
"Cleanliness 5 Stars nThe front of the restaurant smells and appears very clean and sanitary. This small shop definitely takes pride in ownership n nHospitality 5 stars nThe staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. I used their call ahead order service and was impressed with the friendliness and promptness received. n nFood 5 Stars nThe portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and came accurate. n nOverall nThis place is great for a ""quick "" meal and more affordable than a traditional sit down restaurant. I would recommend to others looking for non traditional Mexican food on the go this is a good option.",2
"Wrapping up dinner now. Basically a repeat of others. Food is solid, not exceptional. However service is pretty abysmal. The only people that are hustling are the bus boys. The servers are aloof and disinterested. I think they've grown way past complacent. The place is dirty the side plate had old rice stuck to it still. Server could have cared less when we pointed it out to him. n nI won't be coming back here.",1
I used us airways because It was affiliated with hero miles. Well when I arrived at Charlotte NC to switch planes i was supposed to wait an hour and a half for the next plane to leave. Well that didn't happen when i arrived I had to run from one end of the airport to the other end and didn't have enough time to get food to eat on the plane. On my return trip back from Las Vegas I had to switch planes again in charlotte nc. Well at first my plane from charlotte nc to florence SC was delayed. Then at the last minute they canceled it. So I was not able to get a hold of anyone on time to come drive an hour and a half to get me. So the airlines offered a hotel but i had to pay up front and then get reimbursed 75 when the airlines were at fault. Well even if I wanted to stay at a hotel there wasn't anything available because of some race going on. And it wasn't just me going through this there were about 60 other passengers that slept at the airport. Not to mention that i havent eaten for about 12 hours 24 hours by the time I got home . The airlines didn't offer to buy any food or anything to the passengers. They only offered flights for the next day to the destinations the passengers already paid for. This is my 1st time ever using an airplane for this trip so my experience was terrible for my first time. Is the a way I can give them a negative star?,1
"This is a ZERO STAR review. Awful service. There is no pride in food prep or service here. Would you serve garlic knots that were completely CHARRED and burnt to your guests? One of the few guests, I might add, who is trying to support you and keep your sorry ass in business! It is so sad! No wonder there are only two customers ever in there at one time.",1
"Quaker Steak rocks! Dont listen to any of the reviews with less than 4 stars these people have no idea what they are talking about. n nWe came to Madison and had to make a special trip here since seeing the Man vs Food segment where Adam takes the ""atomic wing challenge "". They make you sign a paper saying the restaurant is not liable for any harm you do to yourself after eating 6 of these bad boys oooh, scary! . Andy ordered the flavour that was one less hot than the Atomic, which were called the Supercharged. n nThe wings come and while they were awesome, they werent anywhere close to the heat level I was expecting. I wanted to be writhing on the floor in pain, gasping and pleading for my life, and they merely created a bit of sweat across the brow, nothing more. Had I been hungrier, I could have had 6 more with no problems. n nThe interior is definitely geared towards men, with gas pumps and neon signs and an actual Nascar hanging from the ceiling. The exterior looks like an old time gas station. I dont really care about that, all I care about is the next time I get to visit Madison and get to have more of those Atomic wings!",2
"This visit was the first and last time my sister and I will ever make. We walked in, and were not even greeted. The ""salesclerk "" apparently was way too busy with 2 other customers. We walked throughout the entire store with not one Acknowledgement that we even existed. Upon leaving the store, not even a goodbye or thanks for coming. Needless to say, my money went elsewhere and will continue to do so. Absolutely the most horrid ""customer service "" or should I say lack thereof . nThe most rudest behavior I have ever encountered. How unfortunate.",1
DO NOT OPEN up a mailbox at this facility. The staff has fucked up my mail by telling the delivery driver I'm not a client after I have just opened up a box and paid 175 for the year. Not Private at all. Note to Goin Postal Quit fucking with people's mail!,1
"Truly disappointing. The King Crab Legs were frozen and extremely salty. Maybe their plan is to make you drink more so you eat less. The Prime Rib needed salt. The Shrimp Cocktail was standard. The only part that was exceptional were the desserts. For about 30 per person I would try either the Wynn, Paris, Mirage or Bellagio buffet.",1
"Seafood City is a great place to grab ingredients for you typical Asian Filipino dishes. Adding to they're variety of Asian Filipino foods they also have a grocery like any other Neighborhood Walmart would. Definitely a good place to do some grocery shopping. Prices are average facilities are clean and order, they also have a Jollibee, Chow King, and Red Ribbon in the same store if you get hungry.",2
"I love you wingstop.for cooking up the fastest batch ever before I risk missing my flight. You never disappoint me with the garlic parmesan, which I will forever be loyal to. Thank you.",2
Nice workers with a large no homo selection!,2
"I've recently relocated from the West Side of Madison to a nice little neighborhood in Verona. While in Madison, I did most of my shopping at two places Woodman's for staple goods and Willy Street for produce and specialty items . n nI had heard great things about Miller Sons, but was skeptical I figured they wouldn't have the selection nor would they have the good prices that Woodman's offers. Boy, was I wrong! n nThe Verona store is expansive they fit a ton of stuff in the place without making it feel crowded and uncomfortable unlike Woodman's . The store is also spotlessly clean and very well lit with plenty of room for carts and people in every aisle unlike Woodman's . And, the employees are friendly and helpful unlike Woodman's . n nBest bets at Miller Sons n n Bakery goods made onsite daily try the creme filled donuts, or any of the yeast raised offerings n Produce lots of local items, great quality and selection n Meat department super helpful and friendly some organic grass fed offerings n nIn general, the pricing is competitive with Woodman's. For example, a large jar of Milwaukee's pickles will run 1.99 at M S 1.89 at Woodman's. A box of Fiber One cereal will run 3.99 at M S, 3.69 at Woodman's as of this review . n nI'll happily pay the few extra cents here and there to shop at a friendly, clean, well lit store with decent selection. A few items are slightly more expensive soda, beer, some cleaning supplies , but all things considered, Miller Sons is a major win not only for my shopping needs but for the community in general. n nAnd I'm serious about those donuts give them a try. They're incredible! I was genuinely shocked when I sampled these confectionery delights. The bakers at Miller Sons have a donut recipe that is to die for the yeast raised offerings are fluffy, slightly crunchy, and downright addictive hint try the caramel topping the creme filled whipped, not Bavarian are super light, just a tad sweet, and amazing. n nHot tip Miller's usually sells out of donuts really quickly, so get there before 3 00pm, or you're likely to miss out. Even more so on the weekends.",2
"After driving around in search of a Chinese restaurant, we decided on this place. This place is hood! It's extra ghetto inside with the worst service ever. I really can't complain though when the dishes are soo cheap. The food just wasn't good. In fact, I would say it's pretty disgusting. I ordered a broccoli and chicken dish, and the chicken wasn't fresh at all. I was actually scared to eat the meat! Everything inside was sticky, dusty and dirty. They definitely need a makeover with the decor, food and service.",1
Had breakfast with my son today and it was a great experience. Kathleen was a great server and made us laugh. Quick and friendly service. Great food. Will be back.,2
Simple and tasty. Big blue burrito was just what I needed.,2
"This Chiropractic office is the best that Henderson, NV has to offer. Dr. Ormand is a great Chiropractor!",2
"This is one of the worst spots to visit. Food is ok nothing extra however, all that means not when you get the worst service ever. If you get the young male server run as quickly as you can out of the restaurant he will make you never want to return. If you get the older female you have a 50 50 chance of staying. She is decent until you ask for a drink refill or a refill of any side dishes. I ordered the tofu soup mild. It came out Extra spicy I love spicy just didn't want it that day and it came out after the other persons meal was done. The sushi guy seems to be ok however sushi at a korean restaurant isn't my first choice. I will never return here simply because the service was that bad.",1
"I don't eat seafood. I have no business reviewing this place, right? Well, my boyfriend had a craving for sushi while we were passing through on a cross country road trip. So we stopped in Phoenix for the evening and this spot came with highest recommendations. Panko encrusted salmon for him and veggie rolls for me. I barely saw the plate set down before the salmon was devoured. The veggie roll however.man, did they put some spin on a pretty basic dish. I'm never wowed by sushi restaurants simply because I never order anything wow able. They sure proved me wrong. Totally filling, deliciously flavorful and made exactly to my particular orders not too big, rice paper, no seaweed, etc. etc. . We had the pesto tomato mozzarella salad and chicken satay both specials as well and while they were devoured pretty quickly they just don't stick out in my mind like those veggie rolls. A pretty innocuous dish that most would likely never seek out but if you have a finicky friend on the fence about joining you for a night at Sushi Roku, they cannot go wrong with this order.",2
"Very good customer service, they take anything back you are dissatisfied with and managers seem nice. They also have a nice selection and alwsys have the items I frequent. The only thing I would change is the people who hand out food and wine samples, they seem under trained and unhappy about giving out the samples, so they almost always never have any ready for me to try. I hope they also get a location closer to Goodyear, AZ!",2
"When they say FastMed they mean it at this location! I booked an appt. online for my son since his PCP couldn't see him today. When I arrived, we were greeted, seen in triage, visited by the NP and out the door prescription in hand within 20 minutes! Now you can't beat that with a stick! A wonderful alternative for those times you can't get squeezed in to your regular physician. I'm hoping we won't need to be visiting urgent care anytime soon, but if we do, this is where we will go!",2
"An average of 4 stars?!? This zoo was below average at best. A total of 15 animal exhibits not counting the smelly monkey house and most of those exhibits had but one specimen. Given all the old money and philanthropic history of Pittsburgh, I was expecting far, far better. A nice setting on the side of a hill with lots of old trees for shade, but dirty and run down. Fort Worth TX, a town of comparable size to Pittsburgh, has a much, much bigger, nicer zoo with animals in open, natural areas. Brownsville TX, a much less populated and less wealthy area than Pittsburgh, has the Gladys Porter Zoo, one of the best in the entire country. Lots of animals with multiple specimens so you can observe them interact in large, open, natural areas. The PPG Aquarium was OK, but again, the zoo was dirty, not very well maintained and sparsely populated. It's a shame that the youth and children of Pittsburgh don't have a much better place to learn about and observe the many animals of our world.",1
"I gave this a 5 star rating right after they opened this location. Since then, I have seen the quality of employees go up and down. I don't know if they have a high turnover rate for employees or what, but the service has been. inconsistent. About half of the time, we get the super awesome 5 star service and food, but the other half, they have inattentive employees that give bizarre proportions of food that is inconsistently seasoned. n nOn our most recent visit, we had a really awesome and helpful person at the tortillas, beans, and meat station that helped us try the new tofu stuff, was awesome and helpful, and then we went to the salsa, etc guy who got my stuff mostly right, and then we went to the cashier that was distracted and slow. n nI don't know what to think of it, overall, but the food is still good consistently enough that we will keep coming back. Management is clearly trying, but I think they may just not have the right people available to hire to be the kind of awesome they want to be. nThe rating is 4 star because it's about 50 3 star, 50 5 star.",2

Well laid out and in a perfect venue, although more bathrooms at the back by the music would be appreciated Music is also great.some live and some recorded . I don't think there is a difference between the VIP and the regular tickets anymore. Nothing extra is given and the amount of people was overwhelming through out the day. I paid extra because it had stated that VIP people would get to sample food and drink and get extra special treatment. Although their was some food tiny samples, it was nothing that a regular ticket did not already get you. Now on to the Bourbon.that was great .Lines were not too long.lots of choices.New and improved kinds.the people pouring were fairly knowledgeable about the flavor and what to mix it with or drinking it straight. Its perfect that you are allowed to bring in chairs and food. You for sure need a DD, and I think they should have a CAB Stand so that people who felt they could drive Dopes could change their mind and take a cab. It took us about 40 minutes to wait for the cab we called. Like I said.good festival.VIP tickets need to include some VIP treatment or Swag.otherwise I would rate it SMOOTH.Like a Fine Bourbon!",2
